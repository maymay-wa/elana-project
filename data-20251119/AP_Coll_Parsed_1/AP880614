e robert wallach says he refused to 
testify against his longtime friend attorney general edwin meese 
iii in exchange for a government offer of leniency in the wedtech 
corp influence peddling case 
wallach 54 made the statement in an interview broadcast 
tuesday night on krontv an nbc affiliate kron said the interview 
was recorded earlier and that further portions would be broadcast 
on a wednesday night news program 
the san francisco trial lawyer called meese an honorable man 
and said there is nothing to talk about with prosecutors 
investigating allegations that meese improperly used his influence 
on wallachs behalf in a proposed iraqi pipeline deal 
wallach who has known meese since law school made the 
statement about leniency when asked if prosecutors had approached 
his lawyers to work out a deal 
yes they did wallach said 
wallach told kron he learned he was about to be indicted on dec 
22 when baruch weiss an assistant us attorney for the southern 
district of new york contacted wallachs lawyer 
weiss notified my thencounsel that they had to give up the 
arrangements they had entered into with him for a series of 
meetings to discuss possible allegations against me wallach said 
instead wallach added weiss presented his lawyer with a draft 
of the indictment 
he gave me three days in which to plead guilty and cooperate 
and then said if in fact i would give it some thought perhaps 
they wouldnt indict me on a racketeering charge wallach said 
the station said weiss replied i cannot comment on that 
when asked if wallach had been offered leniency in exchange for 
testimony against the attorney general 
wallach said he was an unpaid adviser to wedtech a bronxbased 
minorityowned defense contractor he is under indictment on 
federal racketeering charges for allegedly taking payoffs from 
wedtech officials to influence meese and other public officials 
former wedtech officials have testified they paid 800000 to 
wallach to influence meese they have said wallach told them he got 
the attorney general to intercede on the companys behalf for a 
series of contracts worth 143 million meese has denied any 
wrongdoing 
wallach told kron he expects to be acquitted of the racketeering 
charges and said the indictment appears to be very contrived and 
very contorted and extremely difficult to find a crime within it

the ancestral home of millions of people on 
taiwan is here in fujian province on the chinese mainland and 
local officials are trying to lure taiwanese businessmen back 
they have even enlisted the aid of a chinese sea goddess 
taiwan and fujian are separated by 100 miles of water in the 
formosa strait and 40 years of hostility between the communist 
mainland and nationalist taiwan 
some businessmen have come to fujian nevertheless even at the 
risk of prosecution at home 
deputy gov you dexin told visiting foreign reporters that 50 
taiwan firms have defied their governments ban on trade contacts 
with the mainland to invest about 50 million in the province 
the actual number may be much higher most taiwanese avoid 
trouble at home by contracting under the names of hong kong agents 
or relatives on the mainland 
taiwanfujian trade which totalled 40 million last year 
reached 20 million in the first four months of 1988 you said 
most goes through middlemen in hong kong although more than 10 
percent is done out on the taiwan strait overall indirect trade 
between taiwan and the entire chinese mainland was an estimated 
15 billion last year 
fujian officials said among the ideas for bringing in more 
taiwan money are plans to turn three offshore islands into economic 
zones for taiwan investors 
one is meizhou home of the 10th century legendary figure mazu 
who is worshipped on both sides of the strait as a protrectress for 
seafarers for businessmen braving the still stormy waters of the 
strait mazu could provide welcome shelter 
taiwan has been estranged from the mainland since the 
nationalists lost a civil war to the communists in 1949 and fled to 
the island 
china which regards taiwan as a renegade province encourages 
direct trade and communications links as a first step toward 
reunification in the past taiwan adamantly refused all contacts 
with the mainland but it began in october to allow people to visit 
relatives in china 
in the first six months after travel restrictions were lifted 
65000 taiwanese came to china many to fujian where about 80 
percent of taiwans 196 million people have their roots 
fujian officials say it is inevitable that taiwan with its 
currency appreciating against the us dollar and its wage costs 
rising will move factories to china where labor is much cheaper 
and where language and customs are the same 
they can make money here said chen he magistrate of a 
township in the provincial capital of fuzhou which is building a 
24million sports equipment factory with a taiwanese businessman 
this is their homeland and they love it 
during a recent press tour of the province people frequently 
talked of contacts with taiwan enterprises 
hong ziwei a 29yearold toy manufacturer in shishi said he 
would meet a taiwan businessman in august to discuss a joint 
venture to export toys the taiwanese man he said had written a 
letter to a local relative asking for help in finding a mainland 
partner 
in quanzhou mayor chen rongchun said sweet potatoes a favorite 
among millions of taiwanese with roots in fujian could be a big 
seller on taiwan 
taiwan compatriots will cherish an intimate kind of emotion 
for goods coming from this place he said 
much of the taiwanese investment goes to xiamen a southern 
fujian port that is one of the nations four designated special 
economic zones with greater authority to attract foreign investment 
xiamens authorities said 39 projects with anticipated taiwanese 
investment worth 42 million have been approved in such fields as 
jewelry shoes bicycle parts and aluminum window frames 
while emphasizing that taiwan is part of china mainland 
officials say taiwanese are given the same preferential treatment 
as foreign investors or better in xiamen for example 
taiwanesefunded joint ventures receive a fouryear tax holiday 
rather than the three years given foreign enterprises 
two taiwanese business executives in may were given fiveyear 
prison terms by a taipei court for business dealings on the 
mainland because of that fujian officials promise to keep secret 
the details of all taiwanese transactions 
the first question we take into consideration is their 
personal security deputy gov you said we take measures to 
keep their names secret

the telephone company launched a new service for 
culturelovers monday dialapoem 
for 70 cents a minute british telecoms customers can hear 
fiveminute recordings of leading poets reciting their verse 
callers dialing 0898222255 could hear john heathstubbs 70 
saying im very happy to be the first poet to be recorded in 
this dialapoem series before reciting from four of his poems 
ranging in subject matter from noahs ark through cats in poetry to 
clocks and space 
heathstubbs is among six contemporary poets chosen for 
dialapoem 
its too soon to tell whether the innovation will confound the 
19thcentury historian thomas macaulays conviction that as 
civilization advances poetry almost necessarily declines but 
something clearly is astir 
the london subway has beun displaying verses of shelley burns 
and de la mare on some of its trains and a year ago the railroad 
company organized poetry readings at some of its stations 
sarah chesney of the english language society the literary 
group that selected the poets for dialapoem explained in a 
telephone interview we felt we should make poetry more 
accessible 
added lisa bourne a british telecom spokeswoman poetry was 
slowly fading away and we thought it would be a great idea to 
bring it back 
stateowned until it was floated on the stock market in 1984 
british telecom is ever on the lookout for a profitmaking 
sideline and it said that if dialapoem attracted 1000 calls a 
week it would make the service permanent 
others poets reading their verse for telephone callers during 
the sixweek trial run are kathleen mcphilemy jeremy reed bernard 
kops james berry and gillian allnutt 
we wanted something refreshingly adventurous poetry that is 
not so obscure that it doesnt come across well on the phone but 
that is also not strictly traditional said ms chesney 
she said each poet would receive 10 percent of the profits from 
the service 
one problem is british telecoms phone lines which arent 
famous for their clarity heathstubbs came through somewhat 
faintly and would only be comprehensible in a quiet room 
i dont think the telephone does the poets justice in a way 
that hearing them firsthand would ms chesney said but many 
people wont have the chance to hear them firsthand and for them 
its refreshing to hear them the poets in their own voices 
to listen to heathstubbs entire five minutes costs 345 
between 8 am and 6 pm but a cheaper rate during slack hours 
brings the cost down to 225 a sampling from heathstubbss the 
cosmic clock 
planets stars galaxies the whole 
winking and blinking caboodle 
this it seems is the only reliable clock 
a beam from a star crossed a sensitive plate 
then came the pips the british nation 
turned on the 10 oclock news 
 
this is the moving image of eternity 
i dont mean paleys watch discarded 
by the absconding watchmaker 
upon a bank of wordsworthian daffodils 
but pulsars quasars decaying elements black holes 
yet this they say is likewise winding down 
and hickory dickory men and mice we run in it

the nations largest presbyterian body monday 
called on israel to end its 20year occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip where the church said israel had used repressive 
measures to quell palestinian violence 
the 200th general assembly of the presbyterian church declined 
to include in its resolution language calling on palestinians to 
recognize israels right to exist as a nation 
the rev benjamin weir a presbyterian leader and former hostage 
in lebanon told the 630 commissioners the palestine liberation 
organization has made such statements several times israel 
maintains that such plo statements have been ambiguous or 
unauthoritative 
the statement adopted monday on a 49467 vote said israel had 
responded to uprisings in the occupied territories with rigid 
censorship mass arrests torture of prisoners administrative 
detention and deportation 
the resolutions adopted also call upon the palestinian people 
and leadership to exert sustained efforts to control acts of 
violence in order to facilitate the peace process 
earlier monday a major presbyterian statement on nuclear war 
was revised to make the document more closely follow the original 
intention according to the two former seminary professors who led 
the writing effort 
the committee on peacemaking and international relations of the 
presbyterian church usa continued review monday evening of 
christian obedience in a nuclear age making minor changes in 
the recommendations of a subcommittee that extensively reviewed the 
paper 
the major change by the peacemaking committee was made at the 
suggestion of the rev arnold come former president of the san 
francisco theological seminary and a cochairman of the task force 
that wrote the paper last year 
originally the paper said nuclear war and the theory of nuclear 
deterrence were both immoral but the subcommittee revised that to 
say nuclear deterrence has been in danger of becoming an end in 
itself rather than an interim measure of selfdefense such a 
policy as an end in itself is not morally defensible 
come and the rev albert c winn the task forces cochairman 
and former president of the louisville ky theological seminary 
complained the phrase as an end in itself was ambiguous 
at comes suggestion the language was clarified to say nuclear 
deterrence is being regarded as an adequate and permanent means 
to national security and that is not morally defensible 
the committee has yet to deal with the major question of the 
subcommittees recommendation that the christian obedience paper be 
adopted as church policy 
the subcommittee which met for parts of four days amended the 
paper to make it clear presbyterians considered obedience to 
government the normal course 
winn said he disliked many changes but added in many 
respects they clarified the paper and deleted some statements that 
were not carefully worded 
supporters of the original paper expect many of the revisions 
including elimination of a recommendation that the church aid tax 
resisters would be restored in some form in the full committee 
opponents of the paper want it to be sent back to the churches 
for further study an effort to get the subcommittee to recommend 
that delay was defeated 95 and the subcommittee eventually agreed 
to recommend the revised report as a church policy by a 151 vote 
the report is not expected to come before the 630 delegates 
until tuesday the nineday meeting adjourns at noon wednesday 
the resolution on the middle east also 
asks israel to cease the systematic violation of human rights 
of palestinians end the policies andor practices of beatings 
and of food and fuel embargoes in the attempt to subjugate and 
break the will of the palestinian population end the 
settlements policy and the acquisition of land within the occupied 
territories since they provoke the arab peoples and reduce the 
opportunity for a peaceful resolution 
asks the united states to discourage retaliation as a 
counterterror strategy in the middle east and to address the 
injustices which are among the root causes of terrorism insist 
that weapons supplied by the us for israels defense not be used 
against civilian populations in the occupied territories or in 
aggressive attacks or disproportionate retaliation upon other 
countries and that further military and security assistance to 
israel be contingent upon the honoring of these principles 
ask all parties to participate in a united nationssponsored 
international peace conference 
the agenda included discussion of several decisions including 
the recommendation that the pension board headquarters remain in 
philadelphia a minority report suggests the board be moved to 
atlanta 
the headquarters of the 3 millionmember denomination was moved 
to louisville ky last year 
antiabortion groups also have objected to the pension boards 
paying for abortions the denomination has adopted a generally 
prochoice position condemning abortion as a method of birth 
control but saying it remains a decision by a woman her physician 
and her conscience antiabortionists say the pension board should 
not pay for abortions 
another committee has recommended the denomination undertake a 
new study on the issue of abortion

bigcity school districts and southern states 
are requiring students to take an evermounting number of 
standardized tests in the name of reform according to a nationwide 
survey 
us students are now taking at least 100 million standardized 
tests a year says a report published monday by fairtest a 
nonprofit cambridge massbased advocacy group that has attacked 
standardized tests as biased against women and minorities 
the firstofitskind survey found 
elementary and secondary school students took 175 million 
standardized achievement competency and basic skills tests to 
fulfill state mandates in the 42 states requiring them and in the 
district of columbia in 198687 
students took 389 million additional standardized tests to 
fulfill local school district testing mandates according to the 
group 
between 30 million and 40 million standardized tests 
including iq tests were administered to compensatory and special 
education students and schools administered between 15 million 
and 175 million screening tests for kindergarten and 
prekindergarten students 
college and secondary school admissions tests including the 
scholastic aptitude test act high school achievement tests and 
the national assessment of educational progress tests accounted 
for 6 million to 7 million more 
in this country now pupils are being tested far too often 
with far too simplistic a measure school reform has led many 
schools to become too test happy the fallout hits those least able 
to defend themselves said d monty neill managing director of 
fairtest and coauthor of the survey 
the report fallout from the testing explosion how 100 
million standardized exams undermine equity and excellence in 
americas public schools included statistics compiled n a 
telephone survey last spring of education departments in all 50 
states it also surveyed 56 school districts including those with 
enrollments of at least 100000 pupils 
it found that in the 198687 school year the number of states 
using tests as part of statewide assessment programs rose from 37 
to 42 twentyfour states required students to pass a standardized 
test to graduate from high school rose in 1987 compared with 15 in 
1985 
large school districts required the most standardized testing by 
far students in newark nj averaged nine districtmandated 
standardized exams in 198687 according to fairtest cleveland 
students took an average of 292 broward county fla 260 st 
louis 245 cincinnati 234 baltimore 230 and philadelphia 20 
new york city the nations largest school district required 
its students to take an average 123 standardized tests the 
district of columbia mandated an average 139 per pupil 
southern states had the most statemandated tests the nations 
398 million public school students took 17545159 such 
statemandated tests in 198687 an average 044 per student but 
southern states often had testing rates more than double that 
national average 
virginia required its 975135 public school students to take 
1069000 tests during the 198687 school year meaning 110 such 
statemandated tests per pupil kentucky students took an average 
of 101 statemandated exams north carolina 10 alabama 098 
georgia 093 arizona 090 and missouri 083 
historically the south has been viewed as having weak school 
systems there is a belief that you can test your way to better 
schools and the south jumped on it said neill in a telephone 
interview 
tom ewing a spokesman for the educational testing service 
which administers the sat and a variety of other standardized 
exams said he hadnt seen the report and could not comment on it

members of a house judiciary subcommittee 
examining alleged abuses in the fbis investigation of a group 
opposed to the reagan administrations central america policy said 
monday they intend to draft more restrictive standards for probes 
of terrorists in this country 
what weve tried to do in the past is rely on the constitution 
for protecting individual rights said rep don edwards 
dcalif chairman of the civil and constitutional rights 
subcommittee i am thinking seriously of sometime early next year 
taking another quick look at this issue and writing the beginnings 
of an fbi charter 
edwards and other members of the panel appeared to agree with 
recommendations from four witnesses that there should be one 
standard instead of the current two sets of guidelines for fbi 
probes of domestic terrorism and that this standard should be 
written into law instead of left to the attorney general to 
determine 
one witness morton halperin director of the washington office 
of the american civil liberties union said he believes that all 
investigations of political organizations should be based on 
public codified guidelines and should include frequent review to 
ensure that they stay within the prescribed bounds 
halperin added the aclu believes that one publicly enunciated 
standard should apply for all criminal intelligence 
investigations 
spurring mondays hearings was the fbis handling of an 
investigation into the committee in solidarity with the people of 
el salvador or cispes 
the new york times reported in tuesdays editions that 
government officials said an internal fbi report has recommended 
disciplinary action against some bureau personnel possibly 
including field agents involved in the cispes investigation 
the officials said the report is the most critical to date from 
senior bureau officials and was sent last month to fbi director 
william sessions from the bureaus inspection division but the 
officials told the newspaper sessions has not made a decision on 
whether to punish anyone for action in the cispes operation 
fbi spokesman milt ahlerich would not comment on the contents of 
the divisions report but said this agency has no hesitancy in 
disciplining its own people 
according to fbi documents released in january and comments by 
fbi officials since then that investigation began in september 
1981 as a probe into alleged criminal violations of domestic 
security laws specifically the fbi was looking into whether 
cispes was supplying money and material to leftist rebels in el 
salvador 
that investigation was closed the following february but in 
march 1983 the fbi began a new investigation of cispes under a 
different set of guidelines those governing international 
terrorism although much of those guidelines are classified it is 
known that they give the fbi far more sweeping authority to 
investigate us citizens 
eric richard a former justice department aide told the 
subcommittee that it may not have been fully realized how 
frequently the groups that would be the targets of such 
international terrorism investigations would be composed 
primarily of american citizens 
richard and other witnesses agreed that although the fbi said it 
was looking into whether cispes was a front group for a core of 
people who were aiding international terrorists the bureaus 
investigation ended up focusing on public cispes meetings and 
statements 
widescale monitoring of public events served on apparent 
purpose toward achieving the fbis stated objective halperin 
testified a front organization is not going to reveal its 
hidden agenda in its public activities 
halperin argued and john e finn an assistant professor of 
government at wesleyan university disagreed that the fbi violated 
the first amendment rights of cispes members by using that tactic 
however all four witnesses agreed that the fbi never would have 
been able to conduct its investigation that way had it been 
required by law to look for criminal violations 
the domestic security guidelines require a criminal link 
richard said adding that that is not so with the international 
terrorism guidelines 
the domestic security guidelines have worked so well in 
balancing civil liberties intelligence and law enforcement 
concerns that it may be time to spread the benefits of these 
guidelines more widely he said 
the witnesses also said that an fbi statute should require that 
investigations of suspected terrorists in the united states be 
reviewed frequently by top fbi and justice department officials 
kenneth c bass iii also a former justice department official 
told the panel that he thought there was a need for frequent 
reviews because it it my experience these investigations often 
continue a year or more after they should have ended

author peter wright says he has much 
more to tell about britains mi5 intelligence service but plans no 
sequel to spycatcher the memoirs the british government failed 
to suppress here 
there are 10 major stories which i have not put in and 
probably others if i thought hard enough wright told the 
australian broadcasting corp monday 
it was the first time wright had spoken publicly since the high 
court ruled against the british government on june 2 ending a 
threeyear court battle to block australian publication of his 
story 
wright said it was the stories he had not told that led the 
government to fight so hard to suppress the book 
they have always been frightened of what i know and what i 
might say publicly and they still are he said 
spycatcher describes wrights 20year career in the mi5 
counterespionage service 
it alleges that the security service eavesdropped on foreign 
embassies burgled offices stole documents plotted assassination 
attempts and discussed how to bring down harold wilsons labor 
party government in the 1970s 
wright said he had not decided what to do with the unpublished 
material but doubted he would write a sequel 
im too tired at the moment well have to recover from all 
this and i think that perhaps i have done my bit he said 
wrights wife lois commented there will be a sequel to 
spycatcher over my dead body 
wright who retired to tasmania in 1976 said the court battles 
in australia helped make spycatcher a bestseller 
i thought initially we might get a print run of about 50000 
at most now we are looking at more than 1 million copies sold in 
the usa alone he said 
so far more than 14 million copies have been sold in 40 
countries including the united states despite the governments 
continued ban in britain and hong kong 
the book is frequently smuggled into britain and excerpts have 
been published in british newspapers the british government has 
sought to clamp down on these as well prompting outcries over 
freedom of the press 
the government maintains it has pursued the case to uphold the 
principle that former security officers are bound by a lifetime 
oath of silence about their work 
the australian high court said australian courts had no 
jurisdiction to enforce a british security regulation

the countrys foremost theater is gripped 
by a reallife drama that rivals the classics presented on its 
historic stage 
the star is west german claus peymann imported to direct the 
burgtheater and embroiled in battles with his actors and the vienna 
cultural establishment 
a premier of oedipus sunday night turned into a 
demonstration for and against peymann with banners unfurled on 
stage and the divided audience booing and cheering 
a city that relishes scandal and prizes its theaters and opera 
got the first whiffs of sensation on may 26 when the west german 
weekly die zeit published an interview with peymann 
the director said this country is a madhouse and that he was 
often involved in dreadful things of the most banal kind he 
even suggested that the famed burgtheater be torn down 
reaction was swift 
the socialist politicians who appointed peymann in 1986 
predictably defended their choice arguing that the director had 
brought life and exciting art to the marble halls of the burg 
conservatives offended by peymanns stark productions of beloved 
german classics seized the chance to call for the directors 
resignation 
the burgtheater actors were quick to criticize peymann for 
cutting salaries and for changing the way tickets rehearsals and 
roles are allocated 
nearly everybody attacked peymann for bringing in 15 actors from 
west germany most of them are friends from peymanns days as 
director of the west german theater in bochem before he was lured 
to vienna 
the newcomers have gotten almost all the leading roles in 
peymanns new productions but locals ridiculed the new actors for 
their northern german vernacular which offends the ear of an 
audience used to the distinctive delivery long considered among the 
burgtheaters greatest merits 
the issue became the chief topic of conversation in viennese 
coffeehouses and the media entered the fray with debates on peymann 
many commentators saw an attempt by germans to subvert austrias 
distinctive german language and culture franz morak antipeymann 
spokesman for the burgtheater ensemble spoke of a 
deaustrianization of the burg 
peymann countered monday with accusations of nationalism and 
hatred for strangers in vienna 
that charge has often been made in a city that prizes the 
imperial past that gave it the burgtheater and many other artistic 
institutions 
when lorin maazel stepped down as director of the citys famous 
opera in 1984 two years before his contract expired he bitterly 
charged that critics and officials had united to get him out 
criticism of the directors of the vienna opera and the 
burgtheater has a long tradition in vienna where the posts are 
often described as austrias most impossible jobs 
but the drama over peymann has reached an unusual pitch 
with discussion in full swing prominent commentator hans 
rauscher in the tabloid kurier was one of the few to chide his 
compatriots for their absorption in the peymann affair in a 
column rauscher described the effect of picking up austrian 
newspapers on the plane while on his way home 
one can only shake ones head in amusement and despair 
wrote rauscher are these really our worries this orgy of 
smallmindedness these childish quarrels is the plane landing in 
a republic of dwarfs or in a kindergarten

as part of the campaign against the 
spread of aids travelers are being given the opportunity to learn 
how to suggest the use of a condom in seven languages 
sex has become more dangerous this does not mean that one 
should be afraid of sex but observant and careful of oneself and 
others says a pamphlet included in a package for sale at travel 
agencies and train stations around sweden 
the package includes a packet of condoms and a dictionary of 
sexrelated phrases according to the social affairs ministry 
among the phrases are i want us to use a condom and i think 
i might have a venereal disease 
only the condom can provide any good protection against 
sexually transmitted diseases the pamphlet says 
health authorities this year sent 4 million pamphlets to homes 
to explain in graphic detail how aids is transmitted and 
distributed camouflage condoms to military conscripts

a house judiciary panel is considering writing 
tougher standards for fbi terrorism investigations in the united 
states to prevent the bureau from violating the rights of 
legitimate domestic political groups 
lawmakers concede that electionyear politics probably will 
delay action until 1989 but during a hearing on monday into 
alleged fbi abuses in an investigation of antireagan 
administration activists members of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights agreed with 
witnesses who recommended new controls on such investigations 
fbi officials have said an internal investigation of the 
operation found several problems with it and the new york times 
reported today that an internal fbi report recommends disciplinary 
action against some of those involved 
fbi spokesman milt ahlerich would not comment on the contents of 
the report and said that fbi director william sessions had made no 
decision on its recommendations 
the fbi conducted much of its probe of the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador a us group opposed to 
reagan administration policies in central america under guidelines 
that are supposed to cover investigations of international 
terrorism 
using those guidelines allowed the bureau to conduct widespread 
surveillance of political rallies and individuals including nuns 
union officials and college professors opposed to administration 
policy 
witnesses and lawmakers at mondays hearing said there should be 
just one set of guidelines instead of the current two domestic 
and international governing such investigations 
the standard witnesses agreed should specify that the fbi look 
for criminal actions and steer clear of a groups political 
activity 
lawmakers and witnesses also agreed that the standard should be 
written into law instead of left to the attorney general to 
determine 
what weve tried to do in the past is rely on the constitution 
for protecting individual rights said rep don edwards 
dcalif chairman of the house panel i am thinking seriously of 
sometime early next year taking another quick look at this issue 
and writing the beginnings of an fbi charter 
the fbi justified its use of the international terrorism probe 
guidelines in the cispes investigation by citing an informants 
claim that some of the groups members were giving money and 
supplies to a leftist group in el salvador 
but no criminal charges were ever filed against cispes or any of 
its members and the investigation was closed in june 1985 
one witness at mondays hearing morton halperin director of 
the washington office of the american civil liberties union said 
the current guidelines accommodate the demands of law enforcement 
without fully protecting the lawful exercise of our constitutional 
rights 
halperin said the fbis investigation of cispes demonstrates 
that the current fbi guidelines have failed to protect americans 
from improper government surveillance 
according to fbi documents released in january and comments by 
fbi officials since then the bureaus initial probe of cispes 
began in september 1981 as an investigation into alleged criminal 
violations of domestic security laws 
that investigation was closed the following february but in 
march 1983 the fbi began a new investigation of cispes under the 
broader guidelines governing international terrorism although much 
of those guidelines are classified it is known that they give the 
fbi far more sweeping authority to investigate us citizens than 
the domestic guidelines do 
eric richard a former justice department aide told the panel 
that when the international terrorism guidelines were written it 
may not have been fully realized how frequently the groups that 
would be the targets of such investigations would be composed 
primarily of american citizens 
john e finn an assistant professor of government at wesleyan 
university disagreed with halperins contention that the fbi 
violated the first amendment rights of cispes members by attending 
cispes meetings obtaining the groups literature and recording the 
license plate numbers of cars parked outside cispes meetings 
but all of the witnesses including finn agreed that the fbi 
would not have been able to mount such an extensive domestic 
surveillance campaign had it been limited to looking for actual 
criminal violations 
widescale monitoring of public events served no apparent 
purpose toward achieving the fbis stated objective a front 
organization is not going to reveal its hidden agenda in its 
public activities halperin said 
the domestic security guidelines require a criminal link 
richard said adding that those rules have worked well in 
balancing civil liberties intelligence and law enforcement 
concerns 
the witnesses also said that an fbi statute should require that 
investigations of suspected terrorists in the united states be 
reviewed frequently by top fbi and justice department officials to 
ensure that there is sufficient evidence to continue

the supreme court has reduced the governments 
protection against lawsuits by victims of defective federally 
licensed vaccines but some authorities say the rulings impact may 
be limited 
the justices ruled unanimously monday that the parents of kevan 
berkovitz a pennsylvania boy crippled by polio may sue the 
government 
but ronald j greene a lawyer for lederle laboratories which 
manufactures polio vaccine said the impact is unclear 
the decision appears to cover all governmentlicensed vaccines 
and possibly other drugs as well he said but he added that the 
standards enunciated by the court may affect few cases 
the facts alleged here are unusual and i dont know whether 
they the berkovitz family can prove them he said these are 
circumstances that are unlikely to arise very often 
health experts meanwhile said the nations common vaccines 
pose little risk 
in terms of serious side effects its far better to be 
vaccinated than to get the disease said g scott giebink 
professor of pediatrics at the university of minnesota medical 
school 
polio paralysis results only from about one out of every 32 
million doses of oral polio vaccine he said 
in another example about one in 110000 children who get the 
diphtheriatetanuspertussis dtp vaccine develop a brain 
dysfunction that can include seizures it is usually temporary 
only about one in 310000 vaccinated children suffer permanent 
damage that includes mental retardation or movement difficulties 
according to the centers for disease control 
reagan administration lawyers had warned that exposing the 
government to financial liability for faulty vaccines could have 
serious consequences 
the justice department said the threat of bigmoney damages 
against the government could threaten availability of lifesaving 
vaccines by prompting federal officials to reconsider the approval 
of polio vaccine and delay or withhold approval for new vaccines 
the food and drug administration which licenses more than 40 
vaccines declined to comment on the ruling 
a financial analyst said the decision may be good news for drug 
manufacturers 
this is very good for the vaccine companies but there are not 
that many of them said richard vieter a drug industry analyst 
with merrill lynch co one might look ahead to vaccines such as 
aids vaccines and other biotech applications though 
it seems the government will have to exert quite a bit more 
care in the approval process to prevent placing the government in a 
liability situation vieter said 
kevan berkovitz was two months old in may 1979 when his 
pediatrician in charleroi pa gave him a dose of orimune a polio 
vaccine made by lederle 
orimune a form of sabin oral vaccine was licensed by the 
government in 1963 
kevan was stricken with polio within a month after taking the 
vaccine and the us communicable disease center determined he 
contracted the disease from the vaccine 
the boy now 9 is paralyzed from the neck down and uses a 
respirator to help him breathe mondays ruling provides an 
opportunity in court to seek compensation for him from the 
government 
his lawyer ellen viakely of pittsburgh said of the ruling 
its a case where the government knew that this particular polio 
vaccine violated its own regulatory safety standards by the 
governments own regulatory standards this vaccine was unsafe but 
it licensed it anyway 
ms viakely said the ruling will not affect cases in which those 
who received a vaccine had an allergic reaction 
the polio vaccine is the only common vaccine clearly shown to 
cause the disease it was supposed to prevent said samuel katz 
chairman of the pediatrics department at the duke university 
medical center 
sabin vaccine is now administered routinely to nearly every 
child in the united states and has all but eliminated polio but 
each year a small number of people suffer adverse reactions to the 
vaccine federal officials say 
in other actions the court 
agreed to judge the constitutionality of a new sentencing 
system for people convicted of federal crimes by the time the 
justices announce their decision sometime in 1989 more than 10000 
federal court defendants will have been subjected to the new 
sentencing system 
armed police with new authority as it ruled unanimously in a 
detroit case that officers sometimes may pursue someone who starts 
running at the sight of them even though they have no reason to 
suspect criminal conduct 
barred states from banning all directmail advertisements sent 
by lawyers to potential clients voting 63 the justices struck 
down kentuckys policy of prohibiting lawyers from sending letters 
to people they know face legal problems

new findings showing that aids can be 
transmitted through breast milk should not deter third world 
mothers from breastfeeding their babies experts say 
six cases of the lethal aids virus called hiv being spread 
through breast milk were reported monday at the fourth 
international conference on aids but the hazards of bottlefeeding 
in poor countries are probably higher some of the scientists said 
the benefits of being breastfed by an hivinfected mother 
clearly outweigh the risks in developing countries said kathy i 
kennedy of family health international in research triangle park 
nc 
she and her colleagues conducted a statistical analysis showing 
that babies in poor countries are far more likely to die from 
diseases resulting from bottlefeeding than from the possible risk 
of catching the aids virus 
in poor parts of the world bottlefeeding is often risky in 
large part because infant formula can be mixed with contaminated 
water 
researchers from cornell university medical college in new york 
studied 45 aidsinfected children in haiti where aids infections 
are relatively common they said they found no evidence that any of 
them caught the virus from breast milk 
we feel that transmission from breast milk is quite low 
said dr john ho one of the cornell researchers on a broad 
basis it is probably not an important factor 
experts believe that most babies with aids got the infection 
from their mothers before birth there is a 25 percent to 50 
percent risk that an infected mother will pass the virus to her 
developing child 
the risk of contracting the disease through breastfeeding is 
probably substantially greater from mothers infected after birth as 
opposed to those carrying the virus before conception said dr 
john ziegler of prince of wales childrens hospital in westmead 
australia 
breastfeeding women should be aware that if they become 
infected their baby is likely to be infected as well he said 
ziegler has reviewed nine cases in which breastfeeding women 
became infected with the aids virus after giving birth and found 
that three of their babies caught the virus 
he described two of the cases while a third in australia was 
reported by dr marion bucens of princess margaret hospital in 
perth 
we dont know how often this happens bucens said in the 
third world countries this is of great importance because of the 
enormity of heterosexual transmission of the aids virus there 
are so many women who are infected 
ziegler said that for uninfected babies whose mothers had the 
virus before they were born the risk of breastfeeding is probably 
relatively small 
but it appears to be substantially higher if the woman catches 
the virus while she is breastfeeding this is because she is 
likely to produce high levels of virus in her breast milk early in 
the infection 
one typical case was presented by dr pierre weinbreck and 
colleagues from the hospital and medical university of limoges in 
france 
a 28yearold woman received a transfusion of aidstainted blood 
after giving birth she then breastfed her baby for a month 
two years later she developed aids and her child was also 
found to be infected 
two other cases were reported by dr robert l colebunders from 
mama yemo hospital in kinshasa zaire in one of them a baby 
caught the virus from an aidsinfected wet nurse 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers it is is most often transmitted through sexual contact 
other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted 
blood or blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic 
needles or syringes by drug abusers

prime minister margaret thatcher and prince 
charles have joined in a campaign to win for britain one of the 
greatest private art collections in the world according to news 
reports 
the 1600 paintings of swiss baron heinrich thyssenbornemisza 
are regarded as the finest art collection in private hands after 
that of queen elizabeth ii they are conservatively valued at 141 
billion 
there has been a fierce international competition for the 
collection with spain regarded as the favorite the baron 
grandson of the ruhr steel magnate who armed the german forces in 
world war i has made a commitment to spain to show most of his 
paintings in madrid for at least 10 years 
but government sources in london said monday that mrs thatcher 
has written the baron 
a spokesman for the thyssenbornemisza foundation said monday 
that a longterm proposal may have been received from the british 
government but no decision had been made its commitment to 
spain remained unaffected by any proposals from britain the 
spokesman said 
prince charles reportedly broke away from a vacation in italy to 
visit thyssen at his lake lugano home may 4 to discuss the 
longterm future of the collection 
on may 21 mrs thatcher sent cabinet secretary sir robin butler 
to switzerland for further talks at the barons home the prime 
minister followed up her offer of a purposebuilt gallery for the 
collection in a twopage handwritten letter the domestic news 
agency press association said 
roger de grey president of britains royal academy of arts 
said charles and mrs thatcher had done everything possible to see 
that britain did not miss a great opportunity 
the intervention of prince charles is the sort of thing that 
would count in the barons mind said de grey 
the times said the 67yearold baron has been concerned about 
the disposition of the collection begun by his father but broken 
up at the order of the swiss courts at his fathers death 
thyssen was adamant that the collection should remain basically 
intact the times said in a country prepared to give it a 
respectful home 
switzerland west germany and the getty foundation in los 
angeles are also competing for the chance to house the collection

americans wanting to sell anything from 
biscuits and cigars to plumbing and whiskey often have tried to 
cloak their wares in the presumed respectability of congress and 
its most illustrious members 
daniel webster for example 
webster perhaps the most famous senator and orator of the 
mid19th century had his face and his name used to promote cigars 
flour and a concoction known as dr jc ayres cherry pectoral 
promoted as a cure for coughs colds bronchitis croup whooping 
cough and other ailments 
according to a new threecase exhibit recently installed in a 
senate corridor the claim that webster endorsed dr ayres elixer 
may have been somewhat exaggerated 
promoters of the product claimed that webster praised it in 1853 
the famed statesman died in 1852 
the exhibit organized by the us senate commission on art and 
antiquities includes a shiny metal spatula from 1910 which 
demonstrates that even 58 years after websters death his name 
still had commercial appeal 
websters features are engraved on the widest spot of the 
antique pancake turner which is also emblazoned with the words 
daniel webster flour better than the best and one good turn 
deserves another 
websters face was also used on the flour bag with the words 
daniel webster flour bakes everything better 
in an age when a cigar brought to mind a politician webster 
also was used to promote a brand of cigars 
their name 
websters of course 
the names and faces of websters contemporaries sens john c 
calhoun of south carolina and henry clay of kentucky also were used 
to peddle cigars 
and for years old crow whiskey identified itself as the 
whiskey that henry clay took to washington 
from the earliest days of advertising senators have been 
known to endorse commercial products notes a news release issued 
by the senate commission 
from the beginning of the advertising age in the mid19th 
century our countrys enterprises have understood the power of 
national legislative symbols to influence the american consumer 
the commission said 
the display has a title what this country needs taken 
from the 1917 declaration of vice president thomas marshall that 
what this country needs is a good five cent cigar 
although marshall did not recommend any particular brand of 
nickel cigar the exhibit makes clear that he would not have been 
breaking new ground had he done so 
a much later advertisement for lucky strike cigarettes reads 
us sen gerald p nye says i enjoy the comfort a light smoke 
gives my throat 
the familiar image of the capitol dome has been used according 
to the exhibit to symbolize purity wholesomeness 
respectability and success innovation and leadership prosperity 
and celebration 
in one 1890s advertisement the capitol looms in the background 
as two bearded senators are served schlitz beer at a table 
surrounded by ferns 
the capitol at washington is painted with oxide of zinc 
proclaims another advertisement implying that american homeowners 
would do well to use that ingredient on their own domicile 
on display are advertisements for breakfast cereals stationery 
soft drinks biscuits tires soap cameras and plumbing all 
using the capitol theme 
one proclaims that the durham plumbing system has been installed 
in the greatest building on this continent the capitol at 
washington 
in another fashionably dressed men presumably senators are 
shown striding up the senates marble steps 
all of this has caused an occasional raised eyebrows and the 
arts and antiquities commission notes that the use of the capitol 
in commercial advertising never has been sanctioned by congress 
but neither has the practice been banned 
in 1956 the senate judiciary committee reported out a bill 
banning the use of pictures of the capitol or other public 
buildings in advertising when it would be reasonably calculated 
to convey the false impression that the company has some connection 
with or was insured by the united states government 
the measure passed the senate 
but the house failed to act on it

end embargoed material 
bush met on monday with members of the cubanamerican national 
foundation an anticastro group there have been no 
accommodations made with castros corrupt communist government by 
this administration and if i may inject a partisan point i 
guarantee you there will be no accommodations during a bush 
presidency he said 
the private organization has agreed to help resettle some 4000 
latin americans in this country 
dukakis engaged in a form of oneupmanship with bush on south 
africa after the vice president went beyond the usually tame 
administration stance and labeled south africa a racist state 
when informed of that comment dukakis called for an 
international boycott of south africa saying it not only is 
engaging in blatant racism and terrorism it is engaging in naked 
aggression against its neighbors 
jackson headed from chicago to salt lake city today to address 
the us conference of mayors after meeting on monday with the 
editorial boards of the chicago tribune and johnson publishing co 
which prints ebony and jet magazines 
even if dukakis picks someone else jackson told reporters in 
chicago the massachusetts governor could look for backing from him 
so long as our agreements are rational fair and consistent 
but jackson noted that major differences remain including 
dukakis refusal to join him in supporting a military spending 
freeze and tax hikes aimed at upperincome americans 
jackson said he planned to deliver several major policy speeches 
before the convention outlining his programs for health care 
education the war on drugs and foreign and defense policy 
dukakis was leaving behind budget troubles in the massachusetts 
statehouse the governor met for an hour monday with aides and 
legislative leaders in boston about the projected 400 million 
deficit his administration faces 
dukakiss presidential campaign has taken a hard line against 
federal tax increases one participant in the massachusetts meeting 
indicated that the possibility of new state taxes was discussed 
but no decisions were made 
bush received some encouraging news from the latest harris poll 
which showed him gaining slightly on dukakis 
dukakis who held a sevenpoint lead in the same poll in may and 
a doubledigit advantage in other surveys received 49 percent 
support in the latest poll to bushs 44 percent seven percent 
remained uncommitted 
the lou harris amp associates telephone survey of 1258 likely 
voters was conducted june 16 the results each had a margin of 
error of plus or minus three percentage points meaning the dukakis 
lead was within the margin

an agriculture department greenhouse has 
become the site of a milliondollar battle to find some way to 
stamp out the coca plants grown illicitly in south america and 
processed into cocaine usda officials confirm 
the greenhouse near washington is one of two usda research sites 
where 400 to 600 coca plants are being produced under the project 
dr edward b knipling of the agriculture research service said 
monday 
the other is an outdoor site at an undisclosed location in the 
united states where the largely tropical plants will not be hit 
with frost he said 
he said the plants used in the experiment are incinerated 
afterward and that cocaine is never produced from them the 
objective is to test herbicides to determine which ones are 
effective in killing the hardy coca plants 
researchers earlier had grown opium poppies in thailand and 
marijuana in the united states as part of usdas research into ways 
to stem narcotics but the priority changed two years ago because 
of growing use by americans of both cocaine and crack a cocaine 
derivative knipling said 
usdas coca production was disclosed sunday in the new york 
times 
knipling estimated the cost of the program at about 1 million 
a year he said some funds come from the research services 
regular budget and the rest from the state department 
guards alarms and wire fences are being used to keep out 
intruders at the installations knipling said he refused to 
disclose the precise whereabouts of either of the growing sites 
coca seeds were brought to the united states from south america 
knipling said he said a number of herbicides have been tested for 
use against coca 
the chief herbicide recommended to the state department is 
tebutherion a product manufactured by eli lilly amp co of 
indianapolis under the trade name spike knipling said it is used 
in the united states to clear brush in areas where food crops do 
not grow 
the subject of usdas testing surfaced when the former head of 
the project walter gentner told reporters he had resigned in 
april to protest what he called the failure of the agriculture and 
state departments to examine thoroughly enough the potential 
dangers from use of the herbicide 
knipling said south american cocaine production is doing far 
more to endanger the environment than would use of tebutherion he 
said there was little doubt that the coca leaves were being heavily 
sprayed with pesticides which could cause harm 
moreover he said sulfuric acid and other chemicals being used 
to process the coca into cocaine undoubtedly are dumped into 
streams when the manufacturing process is over 
george dunlop assistant secretary of agriculture for natural 
resources and the environment said coca producers in their 
efforts to satiate the habits of american cocaine addicts are 
doing heavy and extreme environmental damage 
they are slashing and burning the tropical rain forest to 
clear more ground for coca planting he said

minnesota gov rudy perpich emerged from a 
visit with agriculture secretary richard e lyng and reported no 
progress in getting the government to suspend conservation 
restrictions to combat drought problems 
i hope therell be rain in the next two weeks perpich said 
monday after the session in lyngs office 
he said lyng was encouraging about an emergency feed program to 
help livestock producers whose hay and grazing land have been 
scorched by drought but refused to lift curbs imposed under the 
conservation reserve program 
that program established in 1985 aims to take 45 million acres 
out of crop production by 1990 and cover them instead with trees 
and grasses farmers sign contracts to include such highly erodible 
lands in the reserve and in exchange obtain government payments 
usda officials recently estimated the overall cost of the 
reserve program to the taxpayers at 677 million for 1987 1864 
billion for this year and 216 billion next year 
lyng has the power in an emergency to suspend program rules that 
bar cutting hay and grazing livestock on such lands 
perpich said however that lyng was reluctant to do so saying 
the lands involved are fragile and should remain in conservation 
use 
under an emergency feed program the federal government would 
pay substantial costs for acquiring feed for livestock and bringing 
it into the state but local officials would have to apply for it 
lyngs office said he would have no comment on the session with 
the minnesotans 
earlier perpich met with sen quentin burdick dnd the 
governor said he would discuss the situation later with senate 
agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
minnesota agriculture commissioner jim nichols said the drought 
could wipe out as much as half of the states crops and that the 
cost to the hardest hit counties in that case would total 400 
million 
there just is no hay in minnesota he said he said that 
opening the conservation reserve program acreage would cost the 
taxpayers nothing while putting an emergency feed program in effect 
would carry a price tag

cuba has added a new dimension to the complex 
conflict in southern africa by constructing a military air base in 
southern angola just a few minutes flying time from south 
africancontrolled namibia according to us officials 
the construction of the base in support of increased cuban troop 
strength in southern angola appears to have heightened the 
possibility of an eventual clash between cuban and south african 
forces the officials said 
in addition to namibia south africa also has forces in angola 
supporting a usbacked anticommunist rebel group 
the presence of the cuban troops within 10 miles of the namibian 
border prompted south africa to call up army reserves last week 
the south africans say the cuban forces interspersed with namibian 
guerrillas fighting for independence are spread across a 280mile 
front 
according to the officials who asked not to be identified cuba 
appears to be jockeying for position as talks aimed at reaching a 
negotiated settlement intensify 
president fidel castro informed a gathering of third world 
foreign ministers meeting in havana two weeks ago of the 
construction of the air base 
we now have air superiority and antiair superiority cuban 
news accounts of castros comments said 
we have the means to confront any south african adventure 
he said us officials said the air strip under construction 
appears capable of handling mig23 jet fighters 
in early may south africa joined the united states and a joint 
angolancuban delegation in london for unprecedented peace talks 
the us objective is achieving an agreement that will lead to 
south africas withdrawal from both angola and namibia and the 
withdrawal of the estimated 43000 to 45000 cuban troops from 
angola 
castro said south africas willingness to negotiate was the 
result of the cuban troop deployment near the namibian border 
also part of the equation is the americanbacked rebel movement 
in angola which has been fighting that countrys marxist government 
for 13 years but the united states considers that issue to be an 
internal angolan problem which should not be part of the 
negotiating effort 
all sides said the london talks were constructive and they 
agreed to meet again there has been no agreement as yet on a site 
the parties to the conflict are far apart on a timetable for 
reaching a settlement cuba and angola have set out a fouryear 
timetable for the withdrawal of the cuban troops while insisting on 
a oneyear process leading to black majority rule and independence 
for namibia as well as the withdrawal of south african occupation 
forces from the territory the independence process for namibia is 
spelled out in a un security council resolution 
meanwhile vice president george bush pledged on monday that if 
elected he will make no accommodations with cuba 
he made the statement at a ceremony formalizing an agreement 
with the cubanamerican national foundation that will permit the 
immigration to the united states of about 1500 cubans living in 
third countries 
the foundation an anticastro group has agreed to pay the 
costs of resettling the cubans in the united states

after 16 years and more than 4 
billion miles pioneer 10 is still speeding toward interstellar 
space and perhaps for the next decade should continue to provide 
clues to some of the puzzles of the universe scientists said 
the little spacecraft which left the solar system five years 
ago has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its original 
mission to study jupiter and the asteroid belt scientists said 
the 570pound pioneer 10 is relaying strong evidence to suggest 
a mysterious planet x or possibly two smaller planets exist beyond 
pluto john d anderson of the national aeronautics and space 
adminstrations jet propulsion laboratory said monday 
we have a 90 to 99 percent confidence that uranus and neptune 
are being disturbed and one candidate for that is a single planet 
x he said 
anderson and other scientists reported on pioneer 10 to observe 
the fifth anniversary of the crafts leaving the known solar system 
the probe was launched in 1972 and traveled an arcshaped 620 
million mile path from earth before making its closest approach to 
jupiter 82000 miles on dec 3 1973 
pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to cross the asteroid belt 
between mars and jupiter and fly by jupiter and return pictures 
it also was the first to chart the giant planets intense radiation 
belts and measure the mass of its four planetsize moons data from 
pioneer 10 showed that jupiter is predominantly liquid 
its twin pioneer 11 was launched in 1973 encountered jupiter 
a year later and reached saturn in september 1979 
scientists said pioneer 10 is expected to operate another seven 
to 10 years and may run out of energy before it reaches 
interstellar space 
until then the spacecraft will keep looking for long gravity 
waves proposed by albert einstein and may give scientists clues to 
the shape of the heliosphere the boundary of the suns influence 
one of the principal current objectives is the observation of 
cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored 
distances from the sun said physicist james van allen of the 
university of iowa a principal investigator on the project 
we now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer 
boundary of the heliosphere and of penetrating into the nearby 
interstellar media said van allen who discovered radiation 
belts surrounding earth 
pioneer 10 is now sending back radio signals from a distance 45 
times the distance between the earth and sun 
the energy picked up by a 230foot deep space antenna would have 
to be stored for over 11 billion years to accumulate enough energy 
to light a 7watt nightlight for one millisecond said richard o 
fimmel project manager at the nasa ames research center 
but the signals from pioneer 10 and 11 are strong enough to send 
high quality data on a daily basis van allen said

consumer groups are criticizing a compromise 
bill fashioned by the house energy and commerce committee saying 
the measure will make it harder for victims of unsafe products to 
recover damages from manufacturers 
both sides in the protracted struggle between business and 
consumer lobbyists agree however that there is virtually no 
chance the socalled product liability bill will pass congress in 
this election year 
the measure will go next to the house judiciary committee which 
shares jurisdiction over the issue but has balked at approving such 
legislation in the past even if it manages to reach the house 
which many congressional observers doubt the senate is considered 
a graveyard for product liability bills 
the measure eagerly sought by corporations worried about 
escalating liability costs would impose a uniform federal standard 
of liability preempting a wide variety of conflicting state laws 
consumer activists complain that the new proposed federal 
standard would limit victims of hazardous products to six narrow 
grounds for suing manufacturers for damages negligence 
intentional wrongdoing defect design defective construction 
inadequate warnings and breach of written warranty 
another major feature contested by consumer advocates is the 
state of the art defense available to manufacturers 
this provision says that a manufacturer can escape liability for 
damages if it can prove it did not know or could not know of a 
design defect with knowledge reasonably available to experts 
or if there were no feasible alternative design 
a proconsumer escape hatch sponsored by rep mike synar 
dokla would require only that the plaintiff prove that the 
product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it should 
not have been marketed the committee also accepted synars 
proposal easing the standard of proof that plaintiffs must meet 
the synar provision also would put a burden of proof on the 
manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be discovered 
and that an alternative design was not feasible 
consumer lobbyists are unhappy though with synars proposal to 
give a judge not a trial jury the responsibility for deciding 
whether a product was so unsafe it should never have been marketed 
even with synars softening of the probusiness features of the 
original bill consumer groups say the measure undermines the legal 
doctrine of strict liability used by 47 states and favored by 
victim advocates 
that doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the 
manufacturers alleged misconduct to the defective product itself 
relieving the courts of establishing what a manufacturer knew or 
should have known about its product 
consumer lobbyists argue that even though the bill makes strict 
liability a national standard in deciding damage suits it is 
weakened by including a stateoftheart defense against 
manufacturers liability which currently is allowed in only eight 
states 
not covered by the bill are tobacco alcohol and asbestos those 
products would continue to be subject to generally more stringent 
state liability laws 
the bill also includes a provision backed by antiabortionists 
that would deny special protection to any drug or contraceptive 
device that induces abortions

a federal judge is deliberating whether to 
shut down an exhibition of giant pandas at an ohio zoo because of 
complaints from a wilflife group the endangered animals are being 
commercially exploited 
us district judge norma johnson was urged monday by the world 
wildlife fund to issue a preliminary injunction shutting down the 
exhibition at the toledo zoo 
since may 24 the zoo has been exhibiting two pandas on loan 
from china after receiving a permit from the us fish and wildlife 
service 
bruce berman an attorney for the wildlife fund argued the 
federal agency should not have issued the permit because it failed 
to find that the importation of the pandas was not primarily for 
commercial purposes and that it would promote survival of the 
species 
james kilbourne an attorney for the wildlife service said the 
agency determined that import of the pandas would not be 
detrimental to their survival and that while the exhibit would have 
some commercial trappings it was not primarily for commercial 
purposes 
ellen efros an attorney for the zoo said the separate 
admission fee for the panda exhibit was established only for 
financial accountability purposes 
ms efros said closing the exhibit would rob the public of a 
chance to view an endangered species and learn something about 
china and she said it could have a potentially harmful effect on 
uschinese relations

three years ago today two young men who could 
have passed for welldressed college students hijacked twa flight 
847 shortly after it took off from athens their act launched a 
dramatic episode that lasted for 17 days 
by the time it was over 39 men had been held hostage in beirut 
for two weeks a young navy diver was dead and the plane had logged 
more than 8500 miles between greece lebanon and algeria 
for the 153 passengers and crew 104 of the american the 
ordeal is something they will never forget though many have tried 
it wasnt a fun deal to go through said robert peel 36 of 
hutchinson kan we really dont like to talk about it because 
every time you do it brings it up again 
john mazurowski 68 of lancaster ny said the hijacking is 
an issue we would like to forget mazurowskis daughter melissa 
a recent graduate of barnard college still has back trouble as a 
result of the 30 hours they spent on the plane her father said 
william cocoris a restaurant owner from boston mass said he 
no longer flies on american carriers when he visits his family in 
greece i think we are targeted he said 
memories have been evoked recently by a television film about 
the flight a book by the pilot and news reports about the upcoming 
trial in germany of one of the hijackers 
mohammed ali hamadi is scheduled to be tried in frankfurt july 5 
on charges of air piracy and murder in the death of robert d 
stethem of waldorf md the young navy man was beaten and shot 
during the hijacking 
hamadi a lebanese shiite thought to have ties to the radical 
group hezbollah was arrested in january 1987 as he went through 
customs with explosives in his luggage the united states tried 
unsuccessfully to extradite him 
court spokesman falk thomas said two of stethems relatives and 
six former hostages will take part in the prosecution stethems 
parents could not be reached for comment 
another suspect hassan izzaldin was identified by passengers 
as one of the people who hijacked a kuwaiti airways plane earlier 
this year according to a state department official who asked that 
he not be named the department does not have official 
confirmation he said 
on may 2 nbctv aired a twohour docudrama about the episode 
entitled the taking of flight 847 the uli derickson story 
actress lindsay wagner played derickson the purser on the flight 
who had close contact with the hijackers because she translated 
their demands from german into english during the flight 
mazurowski said the movie was quite factual though it tended 
to glamorize parts of the ordeal 
helen sheahan a twa flight attendant who has a vivid 
recollection of the events said she was disappointed with what she 
called distortions in the movie for instance she said none of the 
passengers talked during the flight but the film shows stethem 
discussing with a friend what to do 
the truth would have been just as compelling she said 
capt john l testrake of richmond mo wrote a book last year 
about the hijacking which he dedicated to stethem 
he looked at hate and death squarely and fearlessly and no 
cry was heard to come from him testrake wrote in triumph over 
terror on flight 847 published by fleming h revell co 
i cannot describe how i felt when stethem was killed he 
said there was just a heavy heavy sadness that washed over me 
in the book which deals heavily with testrakes religious 
faith the retired twa pilot said he knew little about the politics 
of the middle east until the hijacking 
i was awakened from this typically american isolation by the 
black bore of an automatic pistol in my face and by the angry eyes 
behind it he said i have discovered that our country is 
resented in this region 
twa spokesman bob blattner in st louis mo said he had no 
information about any settlements offered to passengers on flight 
847 one former hostage said in 1985 the company offered 35000 to 
passengers held until the end of the 17day crisis and 15000 to 
those released earlier

congress is moving to close a loophole in the 
control of pcbs the highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls that 
were banned in 1976 
a bill passed by the house by voice vote monday takes direct aim 
at pcb brokers the middlemen who collect the chemicals from their 
use sites and arrange for their destruction 
while the use and destruction of pcbs are heavily regulated 
there has been no governmental control over them between the time 
brokers pick them up and when they deliver them to a destruction 
facility such as an incinerator 
rep thomas luken dohio said the bill that moved to the 
senate responds to reports that some brokers have improperly 
handled pcbs and in some instances have gone bankrupt leaving 
power companies and communities to clean up storage sites 
literally anyone with a truck can now get into the pcb 
disposal business said rep mike synar dokla a principal 
sponsor of the bill its time to put an end to the sham these 
pcb operators have put on us its time to put them out of 
business 
pcbs are most frequently found as an insulation fluid in heavy 
duty electrical equipment congress banned their manufacture in 
1976 but an estimated 750 million pounds are still in use or in 
storage 
luken said that as the electrical gear wears out over the next 
few years the nation will be faced with the task of safely 
disposing of a growing amount of the chemicals 
the bill would require pcb brokers to be registered keep 
records and demonstrate financial responsibility

lightning deaths around the nation last year 
rose to the highest level in this decade and the rate of 
lightningrelated injuries was nearly 50 percent higher than usual 
according to new government figures 
twice in 1987 lightning claimed three lives with a single bolt 
in new york and tennessee the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration reported monday 
one maine youth wasnt even safe at home in bed and under the 
covers on july 31 a bolt struck his home in nantucket county 
traveled down a wall and knocked the 19yearold out of bed 
that youth was among 365 people hurt during the year well above 
the 250 annual average eightysix were killed the most since 88 
died in 1978 
but the total was still short of the annual average of 96 
deaths lightning deaths have been declining in recent years 
dipping to a record low of 68 fatalities in 1986 before rebounding 
last year 
lightning apparently does not command the respect it deserves 
as a dangerous killer e w friday director of the national 
weather service warned in a statement among weatherrelated 
hazards only flash floods kill more people annually than 
lightning he said 
three golfers taking shelter under a tall tree on a hill were 
killed july 3 at warriors path state park near kingsport tenn 
and on july 26 lightning killed three campers sleeping in tents 
at darien lake in genesee county ny scorch marks indicated that 
the bolt first struck the aluminum pole of one tent killing its 
two occupants then jumped six feet to another tent and 
electrocuted the third person 
on the same day a 28yearold man was killed and three others 
injured at lake russell ga when struck while in a tent located 
near a tall tree 
and just four days later a similar instance injured but spared 
the lives of three campers in new york state three girls were in a 
tent in new scotland in albany county when a bolt struck a nearby 
tree and traveled through the root system to their tent where it 
melted a sleeping bag and left all three with burns 
a father and son camping in the boundary waters canoe area in 
lake county minn were killed july 24 when lightning hit a white 
pine 20 feet from their tent two other people were burned 
last years high injury list included instances in which a 
strike injured a group of people 
some 30 people in chicago heights ill were injured in a 
single strike july 29 for example when lightning hit a tree and 
then bounced to a metal gate where people were leaving a ball game 
some people were knocked four or five feet and two were seriously 
injured 
in another case on aug 12 24 were injured in silver city 
nm when a bolt hit a high school football field near a group of 
players the injuries which included 18 football players were 
mostly minor burns 
seven people sitting under a tree in green county ohio were 
injured by a lightning strike july 11 
a halfdozen national guardsmen were injured aug 4 when a bolt 
struck during a night exercise at fort mcclellan ala while on 
july 24 five coast guardsmen standing on a seawall at port huron 
mich were injured by a bolt 
overall nearly onethird of the people injured were affected by 
just nine strikes 
as usual florida led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last 
year tennessee ranked second with 6 followed by 5 in new mexico 
and 4 each in alabama arkansas minnesota mississippi new york 
and north carolina 
colorado georgia illinois louisiana maryland new jersey 
oklahoma and south carolina each recorded three fatalities there 
were two each in arizona kentucky missouri utah and virginia 
recording a single lightning death for the year were washington 
dc kansas montana north dakota pennsylvania and south dakota 
in addition to deaths and injuries extensive property damage 
was caused by lightning each year for example lightning strikes 
kindled more than 900 fires in oregon last august laying waste to 
130000 acres of forest land in the worst fire since the socalled 
telbrook burn in 1921 
a lightning strike doesnt always mean a fire though on july 1 
a bolt ruptured the salem sc water tower causing a spill of 
100000 gallons

a reporter investigating allegations of 
abuse at a jail was charged monday with illegally taking papers 
from prisoners 
karen e olson of the tallahassee democrat took papers from one 
of four prisoners she interviewed saturday and refused to hand them 
over to jail officials leon county sheriffs officials charged 
removing contraband from a correctional facility is a 
thirddegree felony that carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison said sheriffs maj larry campbell 
the newspaper said it had employed ms olson 34 as a reporter 
since 1982 and that she has been investigating prisoners at the 
jail since april 
the democrat fully supports her and has supported her with 
legal counsel we believe the judicial process will vindicate 
her managing editor bill fuller said monday night in a statement 
ms olson surrendered at the sheriffs office monday afternoon 
and was charged booked and released on her own recognizance 
gary williams one of two lawyers representing ms olson said 
monday that there are significant constitutional problems with 
the statute under which the reporter was charged raising 
significant first amendment issues 
williams said he tried to discuss those issues with sheriff 
eddie boone on monday but boone declined to do so 
were obviously going to have to discuss them in court now 
and thats where i feel karen olson will be fully vindicated

most states took a turn in the 1988 
campaign spotlight when their presidential primaries rolled around 
the candidates came the reporters followed the television lights 
went on and at least fifteen minutes of fame ensued 
but not in north dakota 
the state which held the first presidential primary in the 
nation in 1912 holds the final presidential primary of the year 
today 
this should be worth a little attention right 
wrong 
no democrats bothered to file on the republican side the 
ballot lists only george bush and mary jane rachner a retired 
minnesota teacher who says the spirits of her late mother and 
grandmother told her to run for president 
the primary doesnt really mean anything concedes jim 
schlosser cochairman of bushs campaign in north dakota 
the vice president long ago wrapped up the 1139 delegates 
needed to win the gop nomination and north dakotas 16 delegates 
are expected to follow the crowd 
bush underscored the insignificance of north dakotas primary 
during a speech in denver over the weekend that was telecast via 
satellite to a north dakota republican party meeting 
the primary process is over on both sides bush said 
theyre worthless secretary of state ben meier one of the 
republican leaders at the meeting said afterwards of north 
dakotas presidential primaries 
even so meier predicts as many as 100000 voters will go to the 
polls tuesday but only because of ballot measures that would 
create a state lottery and repeal a tax on cable television service 
people would be more interested in voting in the primary if 
there was a reason to be there said state gop director gary 
emineth 
north dakota conducted the nations first presidential primary 
march 19 1912 but the primary was dropped from 1932 until it was 
revived by the 1979 legislature which saw the election as a way to 
attract national attention to the state 
the primary was as insignificant when it returned in 1984 after 
the 52year absence as it is this year by almost all accounts the 
primary season this year wrapped up a week ago with contests in 
california new jersey montana and new mexico 
it would have been nice if north dakota had more impact 
state sen ray holmberg a republican who led the effort to 
resurrect the presidential primary said wistfully maybe the 
next time they will

just when the presidential campaign of michael 
dukakis is trying to dampen any talk about democrats raising taxes 
the massachusetts governor is being forced to consider the 
possibility at home 
dukakis met monday with senior budget advisers and legislative 
leaders to talk about his states budget crunch and one 
participant in the meeting indicated the possibility of new taxes 
was discussed 
senate president william bulger and house speaker george 
keverian both said spending and tax issues were discussed but no 
conclusions were drawn 
asked if the possibility of new taxes was talked about bulger 
said every kind of idea is being discussed 
dukakis speaking to reporters briefly on his way out of the 
statehouse also declined to provide any specifics 
it will evolve it will develop we are talking about a number 
of things the governor said 
dukakis was asked about the growing belief by some that higher 
taxes are inevitable 
i dont know if thats true at this point weve got lots of 
things we are looking at and we are making good progress and we 
will have a good solid balanced budget he said 
the governor also declined to say whether he has asked the 
legislative leaders to support any new or higher taxes 
with less than three weeks remaining in the fiscal year the 
dukakis administration is facing a projected deficit of more than 
400 million and budget experts in the administration and in the 
legislature say the next fiscal year could hold more problems 
the house has passed an 118 billion spending plan for next 
year and that budget is pending in the senate the new budget is 
due on july 1 
the legislative leaders said mondays discussions with the 
governor did not focus on any particular deadline although they 
acknowledged that the problem is urgent and more meetings are 
planned this week 
were running against the clock but im sure we will meet our 
timetables keverian said he too declined to reveal details of 
what was discussed in the meeting 
in recent weeks dukakis has spoken repeatedly with top 
lawmakers seeking to reach a broad agreement balancing the budget 
for both this year and next in time to meet the july 1 deadline 
finance secretary frank keefe said there was no consensus yet on 
where to cut spending or on which new taxes or fees might be needed 
keefe said he was urging dukakis to sign a bill projected to 
raise 40 million by imposing a sales tax on cigarettes which 
arrived on the governors desk monday but he said he could not 
predict what dukakis will do 
in the course of his presidential campaign dukakis has leaned 
heavily on his reputation as a competent manager who has kept his 
states budget balanced 
the dukakis campaign has also resisted calls from jesse jackson 
to raise taxes on the wealthy a position jackson would like to see 
included in the democratic platform 
dukakis has said tax hikes should be a last resort and that a 
crackdown on tax cheats should be a first step

confirmation hearing reminded the san francisco lawyer that 
supreme court justice anthony m kennedy quit the same club without 
waiting for changes 
but the most emotional issue at the hearing was walkers 
representation of the us olympic committee in its successful suit 
to stop an organizer for san franciscos gay community from calling 
an athletic competition the gay olympics 
as part of the suit walker placed liens on the property of the 
late tom waddell a 1968 olympian in the decathlon who spent the 
last years of his life fighting the usocs lawsuit before dying of 
aids 
attorney mary dunlap who represented waddell said walker 
placed the liens on waddells property and refused to lift them 
even when he knew waddell was dying 
walker insisted there was nothing malicious in placing the 
liens against waddells home and other property an action that 
followed a federal district judges order that waddell and a gay 
organization pay the usocs 96000 in attorneys fees 
walker told the committee that a later federal appeals court 
ruling during the case automatically vacated the liens 
but ms dunlap told the committee that she was unable to vacate 
the liens without walkers release which he refused to give 
walker eventually gave his agreement but the liens were not 
removed until six days after waddells death in july 1987 
ms dunlap said walker left the liens hanging over a dying man 
at the time he needed to know his daughter would inherit his 
estate 
discussing his club membership walker said he has been working 
from within to get the olympic club to change its policies he said 
it now has an accelerated program to recruit minorities and 
discussions are under way to permit the 800 women members to vote 
a privilege they do not have now 
the nominee first told senators that he would resign if the 
committee asked him to do so told by leahy that there were no 
plans for such a request walker said that if the current efforts 
stall and a hopeless situation results then i would resign 
regardless of whether the committee thought i should resign or 
not 
but he added i think the club is making progress 
walker has drawn opposition from san franciscos gay community 
and the citys board of supervisors which voted unanimously 
against the nomination his main supporter republican sen pete 
wilson of california urged the committee not to turn against 
walker because of the us olympic committee case 
what principle of american jurisprudence is more fundamental 
than that due process of the law requires that however unpopular a 
client that client and that clients cause of action are entitled 
to be represented by competent counsel wilson asked 
walker used similar language in defending himself telling leahy 
i was perfectly aware of how unpopular the position was but he 
added that the committee should be looking for judicial candidates 
willing to take stands that are legally correct even though 
they may be unpopular 
walker said the olympic committee held firm on the lien adding 
it did so in the hope that the gay organization working with 
waddell san francisco arts and athletics would raise the money 
for the attorney fees 
leahy also used the hearing to respond to an accusation last 
month by the committees ranking republican strom thurmond of 
south carolina that majority democrats were intentionally delaying 
13 current and former reagan judicial nominees 
leahy who is in charge of judicial confirmation hearings said 
the justice department caused some delays through tardiness in 
responding to committee information requests on nominees 
he said other delays resulted because democrats want to 
investigate nominees thoroughly before they are given a lifetime 
charter to sit in judgment on the rights and liberties of the 
american people not afterwards

secretary of state george p shultz told 
the united nations it will have no role in superpower nuclear 
weapons reductions and he ignored the soviet unions invitation to 
ban nuclear tests 
shultz addressing a special un session on disarmament monday 
instead stressed the momentum for arms control achieved during the 
reagan administration 
we have made major progress toward a treaty to cut us and 
soviet strategic nuclear arsenals longrange missiles by 50 
percent he said i do not know whether we will be able to 
conclude such a treaty this year but we will make our best effort 
it is the united states top arms control priority he added 
shultzs speech underlined past accomplishments including the 
newly ratified ussoviet treaty to destroy intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles and the verification procedures that go with it 
last week soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze used a 
speech to the conference to call on the united states to take on 
future disarmament challenges 
he proposed abolishing all nuclear weapons by the year 2000 an 
immediate mutual ban on nuclear tests and an immediate cut of 
500000 troops each from the warsaw pact and nato 
shultz replied that the united states will concentrate on 
results which will eliminate the disparities in conventional arms 
in europe that threaten stability not schemes for equal 
reductions which will have no such effect 
nato claims the soviets have an advantage in conventional arms 
in europe 
in the speech shultz also ignored the soviet call for a mutual 
test ban 
the united states similarly failed to join a 1year unilaterial 
soviet moratorium on testing that began in august 1985 
shultz also rejected the soviet call for a un arms reduction 
verification agency to coordinate and monitor disarmament pacts 
some tasks such as work to reduce nuclear arsenals must be 
strictly bilateral in negotiation verification and 
implementation 
but others shultz said above all the negotiations to 
ban chemical weapons and the need to control nuclear proliferation 
are global problems 
shultz offered no specific proposals on those problems 
ballistic missile proliferation is a new and urgent 
challenge particularly in the middle east said shultz his 
advice to iran and iraq was to exercise mutual restraint and 
not buy or launch such missiles 
shultz urged nations attending the conference on disarmament to 
apply themselves to a global ban on chemical weapons which are 
easily made in fertilizer and pesticide factories but did not 
suggest any solutions 
the potential spread of nuclear weapons to other countries 
especially in south asia is a central topic in the uns session 
on disarmament and shultz urged rivals pakistan and india to work 
on the problem 
earlier in the day pakistan offered to sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty if india does so simultaneously 
later this week delegates to the 159member general assembly 
will begin drafting resolutions on chemical nuclear conventional 
and spacebased weapons for this third special session on 
disarmament in 10 years 
the session scheduled to end june 25 has been sharply divided 
diplomatic observers said it will be difficult to draft a final 
document 
the united states and western allies have called for pragmatic 
steps in arms control respect for nuclear deterrence a limited 
role for the united nations and recognition that bilateral arms 
talks must supersede multilateral efforts 
western diplomats also have said that conventional disarmament 
is as important as nuclear disarmament and urged poor developing 
nations that clamor for nuclear disarmament to cut their own armies 
and avoid sweeping and utopian disarmament proposals

former gov evan mecham has lost a 
mistrial bid on the eve of closing arguments in his trial on 
charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
attorneys were to give closing arguments this morning and the 
jury was expected to begin deliberations in the afternoon 
mecham and his brother willard are charged in the maricopa 
county superior court trial with concealing the 350000 loan in 
financial reports required by the state 
in a motion for mistrial defense attorney michael scott 
contended that judge michael ryan may have prejudiced the case by 
expressing surprise when the prosecution and defense said friday 
they had no more witnesses 
the defense rested its case without calling either evan or 
willard mecham to the stand after the prosecution said it had no 
rebuttal witnesses ryan told the jurors the sudden close of 
testimony had taken him by surprise 
scott argued monday that the judges statement could be 
interpreted by the jury as implying that the defense should have 
presented more testimony or put the defendants on the stand 
but ryan said he made the comment in the context of the trial 
schedule in addition he said he did not see how the defense could 
be harmed since he made the remark afterthe prosecution said it had 
no rebuttal witnesses 
ryan also denied a defense request monday that he interview each 
juror privately to find out if any had seen any publicity about the 
case 
mecham was charged with six felony counts of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents and faces up to 22 years in 
prison if convicted willard mecham who was his younger brothers 
1986 campaign treasurer faced three similar counts and up to 9 
years in prison if convicted 
the defense has contended the 350000 loan from developer barry 
wolfson was properly reported as part of a 465000 lump sum listed 
as a contribution from mecham and that the failure to itemize the 
loan was an innocent mistake 
former top mecham aide edith richardson said the loan was common 
knowledge among the former republican governors inner circle but 
two other former top aides donna carlson and mac matheson said 
they did not know about it 
the prosecution has said that mecham badly needed the loan to 
keep his gubernatorial campaign afloat but wanted to keep it secret 
to avoid harming the candidates theme of being beholden to no 
one 
in addition prosecutors said it didnt matter whether mechams 
closest aides knew about the loan because it was not reported to 
the public 
mecham took office in january 1987 and was removed april 4 when 
the state senate convicted him of two unrelated charges he also 
was impeached in connection with the loan but the senate decided 
not to hear that charge for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial

state troopers removed dozens of children 
from a church whose fundamentalist preacher was arrested twice 
monday after harboring youngsters in defiance of a court order 
about 60 state troopers local police and sheriffs deputies 
moved into bethel baptist church after a 4hour standoff at least 
seven people including the assistant pastor of the church were 
arrested 
after interviews 11 children were handed over to state welfare 
officials it was unclear if they had been residents of the rev 
herman fountains 28acre bethel home for children where officials 
charge youngsters have been abused through corporal punishment 
witnesses said at least three dozen children were taken from the 
church authorities said they took all the youngsters away after 
church officials refused to point out three who fountain 
acknowledged in court had returned to the home after it was 
temporarily closed by a judge 
as the children were being taken into the local courthouse 
fountain got into a shoving match with a lawman and was rearrested 
he was arrested earlier along with two staff members and a 
17yearold when a fight broke out at the home leading chancery 
judge robert oswald to call for a grand jury to consider indicting 
fountain 
fountain had refused to answer the judges questions about 
runaways from the home in a hearing earlier monday the judge 
issued 11 subpoenas to staff members of the home apparently 
leading somehow to the fight 
on friday the judge had given state welfare officials temporary 
custody of youngsters at the home on the campus of the independent 
bethel baptist church near lucedale the state department of public 
welfare removed some 60 children but many others fled 
oswald ruled that children ages 10 to 17 had been subjected 
to physical abuse medical neglect and detention amounting to 
imprisonment 
this courts message is simple abuse and neglect of children 
is not acceptable at any time or any place by any person oswald 
said 
oswald said that fountain was wrong to think that since his 
school is part of his church he isnt subject to civil authorities 
the judge said he would first decide the cases of 12 children 
whose parents retained a lawyer and refused to sign an agreement 
not to send their youngsters back to the home 
during a morning break fountain said he believed his home 
housed about 120 children 
twentytwo of 64 children taken into custody by state workers 
were released over the weekend to their parents or guardians state 
welfare commissioner thomas brittain said monday outside the court 
brittain said some of the 42 had been brought to court monday 
but they never testified 
asked about the children unaccounted for fountain said 
i dont know anything about them if i had enough money to 
hire a private investigator to find them i would do that i love 
those kids 
fountain said he feared for the safety of the missing youngsters 
because most had a troubled history he was worried he said some 
might return to using drugs 
about 50 people attended the court session some wearing 
profountain buttons that read eternal life is a free gift 
after several outbursts in the court that included moans crying 
and comments that the judge was prejudicial oswald said there 
is a place for demonstrations but it is not the courtroom there 
may be a place for outcries but it is not the courtroom 
outside court several parents said they wanted their children 
back in the home rather than in the states custody 
pat green of boca raton fla who said she had a 16yearold 
son at bethel said she and her husband refused to pick him up 
because they did not want to sign the agreement that would bar him 
from return to bethel 
we chose to have our children in a religious facility that 
works she said and the state has put their hands in it 
the state is taking away our rights 
brother fountain through bethel saved our childs life when a 
child is on drugs you need the help of religion to get off drugs

in a new effort to end the palestinian 
antioccupation uprising israel plans to force gaza strip parents 
to post cash bonds to free children detained in clashes with 
israeli troops 
police meanwhile announced that they would step up aerial 
patrols to spot arsonists a tenth arab arson suspect was seized 
monday night as he fled a burning wooded area near jerusalem 
israeli radio reported 
a military source said that to curb the daily violence in the 
occupied gaza strip authorities would make parents of detained 
children deposit cash bonds rather than promissory notes to keep 
their youngsters off the streets 
the death count continued to mount in the west bank and gaza 
strip where palestinians have for six months been revolting 
against the 21year israeli occupation 
israeli soldiers fatally shot 43yearold mahmoud hussein in the 
west bank village of abwein near ramallah on monday when he did not 
heed an order to halt said dr yasser obeid director of the 
ramallah hospital 
the victims family said hussein was hard of hearing and 
probably did not hear the order 
a military spokesman said the army was checking into the death 
which brought the total number of palestinian fatalities in the 
uprising to 207 two israelis have been slain 
the military source who reported the cashbond plan said gaza 
city parents would have to pay 5000 shekels about 3100 to 
obtain the release of their children detained for the first time 
the money would be confiscated as a fine if the children were 
detained a second time he said 
previously families could sign a document guaranteeing to pay 
the amount if the suspects were arrested again after being released 
it has to be seen in the context of a whole series of actions 
we have taken to reduce violence said the source who was not 
idenfitied in line with army regulations 
an arab resident of gaza said new fines amounting to the 
equivalent of 9500 against homeowners whose houses were painted 
with palestine liberation organization slogans have virtually 
eliminated such graffiti 
when people see writing on the wall they take it off and do a 
whitewash theyre frightened and dont want to put themselves in 
trouble said the resident who asked not to be named in fear of 
reprisal 
officials reported more brush and forest fires monday night in 
central israel and they blamed palestinian arsonists 
fires in recent weeks have destroyed at least 25000 acres of 
grazing areas forests and nature reserves according to 
naturalists 
police reported the arrest monday night of a 26yearold arab 
suspected of committing arson in the benshemen park along the tel 
avivjerusalem highway 
they said a second forest fire was set near the orthodox kefar 
habad hassidic settlement three miles from tel aviv and residents 
reported seeing two people fleeing the scene according to israel 
radio 
in earlier arrests over the weekend police seized six arabs for 
allegedly setting fires in the jerusalem area and three others in 
connection with forest fires in the northern galilee region 
foreign minster shimon peres told israelis monday not to get 
hysterical about the fires 
he said arab militants are always looking for new means and 
new places we must develop counter measures for this very 
injurious assault

four bolshevik leaders who were purged convicted 
and died during stalins terror of the 1930s have been exonerated 
in the kremlins latest revision of soviet history 
the soviet supreme courts ruling is a signal that open debate 
will be allowed on reform proposals at a special communist party 
conference this month 
the court reversed the convictions of lev kamenev gregory 
zinoviev and karl radek and the lesserknown gregory pyatikov the 
government newspaper izvestia reported monday the move restores 
to these tragic figures their honor and their names the paper 
said 
the ruling does not mean complete rehabilitation unless their 
communist party membership is restored 
the decision had been expected since february when the court 
reversed the death sentence of nikolai i bukharin another old 
bolshevik killed in the purges kamenev and zinoviev were as 
important as bukharin 
izvestia said the court did not evaluate whether they were 
right or wrong in the old debates but it said clearly they are 
innocent before the law state and people 
the article directed extraordinarily harsh criticism at josef 
stalin who killed many former comrades during the terror he used 
to shape the soviet economy and society while he ruled the soviet 
union from 1927 to 1953 
since assuming power march 15 1985 mikhail s gorbachev has 
been dismantling much of the stalinist governing structure 
mondays court decision was another step in that process 
at the party conference scheduled to start june 28 delegates 
will debate proposals to widen the scope of gorbachevs 
perestroika a reform program that some midlevel party and 
government officials are resisting 
clearing bukharin was essential because he broke with stalins 
policy of rapid industrialization in the 1930s and advocated 
policies similar to those gorbachev is pursuing 
zinoviev and kamenev are not identified as closely as bukharin 
with specific policies but izvestia made clear that exonerating 
them was intended to foster debate 
we are learning democracy mastering the rules of political 
discussions also in a time of hard struggle it said in a long 
article under the headline a return to truth 
zinoviev and kamenev spent years in exile with vladimir i 
lenin the bolshevik leader and returned to russia with him in 
february 1917 they opposed lenins decision in october of that 
year to begin the bolshevik revolution but were forgiven and named 
to party posts 
when lenin died in 1924 zinoviev and kamenev sided with stalin 
against leon trotsky who was driven into exile and murdered in 
mexico city in 1940 trotsky has not been rehabilitated but 
several recent articles have dealt with his role in the revolution 
after trotsky was exiled stalin turned on his former allies 
zinoviev and kamenev were convicted of treason and executed after a 
show trial in 1936 
radek born in poland took part in the 1917 revolution but was 
accused of siding with trotsky and expelled from the party in 1927 
he was rehabilitated and edited izvestia in the 1930s but was 
tried again in 1937 and sent to a labor camp where he is believed 
to have died in about 1940 
pyatikov led the left wing of the ukrainian communist party in 
1917 and later held government posts he was sentenced along with 
radek and executed 
our predecessors the people of the 20s could not control the 
situation and were burned up in the flames of repression 
izvestias legal correspondent yuri feofanov wrote in a detailed 
account of the purges 
they preached intolerance toward the opinions of their 
opponents and gave birth to physical and moral terror he wrote 
in a word discussion has been cut off for a long time about 
the paths toward the building of socialism it has been restored 
now more than a half century later and from the same place about 
the paths of developing revolution about the role of the party and 
about the place of the vozhd 
stalin was known as the vozhd supreme leader

the government of socialist president francois 
mitterrand and all of france wrestled with a political identity 
crisis after legislative elections raised more questions than they 
answered 
mitterrand called the elections hoping for a socialist majority 
in the 577seat national assembly polls initially predicted he 
would succeed 
but he didnt although the opposing centerright alliance lost 
the majority it won in 1986 france was bereft of a governing 
majority for the first time in 30 years 
the country is exhausted from having voted too much the 
influential le monde newspaper declared monday it has had enough 
of politicians games it is up to the president everybody says it 
and everybody is right to act 
yet the president likely will find action difficult 
sundays election was a defeat for mitterrand who won his 
second sevenyear term as president may 8 with 54 percent of the 
vote 
mitterrand has in recent times largely abandoned socialist 
principles and talked of an opening to the center on sunday many 
french voters balked at his partys candidates 
mitterrand was making no announcements about his strategy after 
sundays elections but it was clear he could end up with a bruised 
political ego in courting balky centrists or communists 
there is only one conclusion to draw from these failures 
said le monde all arrogance henceforth is forbidden to those who 
govern us or hope to do so nobody can pretend to incarnate the 
will of the people 
the socialists tried to act like victors 
lionel jospin the socialist education minister said one 
thing is sure the right cannot govern all the rightist votes 
together would not make a majority which jospin said can only be 
built around the socialist party the largest single group in the 
national assembly 
but socialists will need help from either the reluctant far left 
or center 
the most logical approach for mitterrand and his premier michel 
rocard would be a coalition with the communists whose 27 seats 
would make a total of 304 for the left 
second on the list of possibilities is an attempt to entice at 
least 13 centrist deputies from the rightist camp 
or rocard could attempt a minority government at least until 
autumn trying to find a majority for each issue 
socialist and communist leaders have made deals and alliances in 
the past but this time communist party chief georges marchais is 
saying no mitterrand cannot make deals with the centerright and 
the communists at the same time marchais has declared and his 
party will judge the government on an issuebyissue basis 
jeanclaude gaudin leader of the union for french democracy in 
the outgoing assembly said of the second possibility if they 
persist today in wanting to detach a few centrist personalities in 
order to turn them into socialists i trust my elected centrist 
friends to reject this proposition which would be unworthy of 
them 
other centrists are more open to the idea of helping the 
socialists 
bernard stasi another centrist said if a very large union 
is going to be constituted which seems desirable to me the center 
must be the pivot 
except for two seats from french polynesia to be decided june 
26 final results gave the socialists 276 seats and communists 27 
the centerright union for french democracy had 129 the 
conservative rally for the republic 126 and minor rightists 16 for 
a total of 271 
a majority requires 289 
the communist party dropped eight seats the farright national 
front got one seat instead of the previous 35 and it did not go to 
party leader jeanmarie le pen

more than a decade in exile before returning with lenin in 1917 he

was a full politburo member and head of the communist international 
until 1926 stalin defeated zinoviev lev kamenev and leon trotsky

the murder of leningrad party chief sergei kirov and sentenced to 
10 years in prisonthe next year he was tried again and executed

the decision by lenin to seize power in the bolshevik revolution 
he remained a prominent party member first joining with zinoviev 
and stalin against trotsky and then uniting with zinoviev and 
trotsky against stalin he was expelled from the party several 
times and sentenced to five years in prison in 1935 he was retried 
in 1936 and executed 
karl b radek born in poland he joined lenins bolsheviks in 
the early days he fought in the russian revolution and tried to

a man who romanced a gas station cashier 
robbed her and fatally bludgeoned her died early tuesday in 
louisianas electric chair it was the 100th us execution since 
capital punishment was reinstituted 
lawyers for edward r byrne jr 28 used up all their options 
monday when louisianas pardon board refused to recommend a 
commutation of the death sentence and then the us supreme court 
refused to delay the execution 
other state and federal courts refused earlier monday to stop 
the third execution in louisiana this year and the states 18th 
since the 1976 us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume 
use of the death penalty 
byrne was executed at the louisiana state penitentiary for his 
admitted august 1984 hammer slaying of roberta johnson who was 25 
at the time a coroner pronounced him dead at 1212 am said jim 
morris deputy state corrections secretary 
when he arrived in the death chamber byrne showed no emotion 
asked if he had any final words byrne smiled slightly shook his 
head and replied nope 
after being strapped into the electric chair and masked byrne 
drummed his fingers while awaiting the first of a series of surges 
of electricity 
six procapital punishment demonstrators stood outside the 
prison one carried a sign that read thanks sam jones 
alluding to the pseudonym used to protect the anonymity of the 
penitentiarys executioner 
the signcarrier identified himself as johnny reece of pineville 
and said he felt deprived because his daughters killer was 
sentenced to life imprisonment 
it gives us a sense of justice to see this done to him 
byrne reece said it doesnt make me happy to see someone 
die but it gives me a sense of satisfaction to see justice 
served 
byrne was calm as he ate his final meal at the louisiana state 
penitentiary monday night after spending much of the day alone with 
his lawyers warden hilton butler said no relatives visited byrne 
and he asked for no spritual adviser though prison chaplains would 
have been available if byrne had changed his mind said butler 
at mondays pardon board hearing byrne was described by defense 
attorneys amanda potterfield and nancy baumgartner as a sensitive 
articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to 
loved ones 
four of the five pardon board members who heard byrnes case 
voted against a lighter sentence a fifth member was absent the 
pardon board has no power to stop executions but can recommend 
sentence reductions for approval by gov buddy roemer 
byrne admitted he started dating johnson because he knew she 
handled large sums of money at the service station where she 
worked but he insisted he never meant to kill her 
johnson died after being struck repeatedly with a ball peen 
hammer 
i just attempted to knock her unconscious byrne told the 
pardon board it didnt work 
byrnes application to the supreme court for a stay was denied 
with the standard dissent by justices william j brennan and 
thurgood marshall who dissent to all executions said court 
spokeswoman toni house justices harry a blackmun and john paul 
stevens indicated they also would have granted the stay ms house 
said but noted that it takes five justices to grant such a stay 
a second application also was denied with dissents by brennan 
and marshall with stevens indicating he also would have granted 
the stay she said 
at the pardon board hearing which took place at the prison 
defense lawyers had yousef danesh a southern university professor 
of political science read poetry by byrne 
baumgartner said byrne was a young man deeply remorseful about 
the death he had unintentionally caused 
henry brown painted byrne as a manipulative rogue and cold 
calculating killer brown said byrne had been caught in a leesville 
hotel room the morning after the killing with a barmaid he had 
picked up at a nearby tavern and had proposed marriage to 
parked outside was a car byrne had stolen from the woman he 
lived with before getting involved with johnson the prosecutor 
said

canadian residents were advised by their embassy 
to wear pins or flags with their nations emblem during last weeks 
scare over a potential terrorist attack against us citizens 
the embassy in notices sent out friday to the approximately 150 
canadians in the chinese capital also recommended that hotels and 
other places frequented by north americans be avoided embassy 
first secretary ec wilson said 
the notice said canadians should try to identify themselves 
through flags or pins because it is difficult for terrorists to 
distinguish between americans and canadians wilson said 
it also provided tips on security but the basic message was 
that this is not a serious threat to canadians 
the us embassy issued a warning thursday to the more than 
1500 americans in beijing saying the chinese government had 
information that unidentified thirdcountry terrorists might attack 
americans 
the warning unprecedented in the chinese capital was canceled 
sunday after the chinese government gave assurances the danger was 
over 
the chinese did not provide details of the terrorist threat or 
explain why the danger had passed but said there was middle east 
involvement

north dakotans today got the second chance in two years to vote 
on a lottery while voters in virginias 5th district will fill the 
seat vacated when rep dan daniels a conservative democrat died 
during his 10th term 
in maine linda beanjones an heiress to the ll bean outdoor 
wear fortune faced edward s omeara ina 1st district republican 
primary for congress the winner will face democratic rep joseph 
brennan a former twoterm governor now in his first term in the 
us house 
south carolina also has congressional primaries today in the 
6th district democratic rep robin tallon faces a challenge from 
luther lighty 
the north dakota lottery is opposed by former gov arthur link 
who says it constitutes a regressive tax on poorer citizens and by 
charities that are allowed to run casino gambling and fear the 
competition 
the measure failed two years ago but backers predicte success 
this time helped by increased public awareness of flourishing 
lotteries in neighboring south dakota and montana 
twentysix states and the district of columbia operate 
lotteries wisconsin and virginia are scheduled to start them this 
summer voters in neighboring minnesota are to decide in november 
whether to allow one north dakota is the only state that has voted 
down a staterun lottery 
in danville va vice president george bush appeared at a rally 
and barbecue sunday on behalf of republican linda arey who faces 
democrat lf payne jr in the special congressional election 
mrs arey a former reagan administration official in the 
education justice and transportation departments said she hoped 
the visit would show voters she has the connections to get things 
done in washington 
payne developed virginias wintergreen resort and ski area 
the maine primary heated up last week when beanjones was quoted 
in the kennebec journal in augusta as calling the minimum wage an 
oppressive law that keeps people from working and saying she 
would vote to abolish the 335 standard omeara labeled her 
position incredible and an affront to workers who rely on 
the minimum to make ends meet 
beanjones later issued a statement saying she thought she had 
been asked about a pending bill to increase the minimum wage but 
her statement did not disclaim her comments in the story 
the latest campaign spending reports show that beanjones had 
raised nearly 377000 nearly 280000 in selfsecured loans 
through may 25 omearas total was 52000

the premiers of greece and turkey 
failed to agree over how to end their 14year division of cyprus 
despite improved relations between the two nato members 
in the general climate of detente it would be strange if 
cyprus remained an example of an unsettled and dangerous 
irregularity premier andreas papandreou said at a dinner monday 
at a tightly guarded seaside hotel outside athens 
visiting premier turgut ozal indicated he will not give in to 
greek pressure for troop withdrawals from northern cyprus and said 
there is no room for petty designs onesided gains and 
shortsighted tactics 
in central athens about 2000 greek cypriot armenian and 
kurdish demonstrators shouted fire for the turkish dogs and 
burned turkish flags and an effigy of ozal outside the turkish 
embassy 
the fires capped a day of antiozal protests that began when 60 
greek cypriot women some relatives of people missing since the 
1974 turkish invasion of cyprus blocked the two gateways to the 
acropolis temples 
more protests were set for today the second day of ozals 
threeday visit when the turkish premier planned to lay a wreath 
at the tomb of the unknown warrior outside parliament 
papandreou speaking at the poolside dinner also said greece 
could not ignore the cyprus problem for legal moral and national 
reasons 
the socialist premier reiterated an earlier proposal for the 
demilitarization of the eastern mediterranean island and setting up 
a mixed greek cypriot and turkish cypriot police force 
last week un secretary general javier perez de cuellar also 
called for turkey to make a gesture by reducing its estimated 
29000strong force in the islands northern sector 
cyprus has been divided into separate greek cypriot and turkish 
cypriot sectors since 1974 when the military junta then in power 
in athens backed a coup aimed at uniting the island with greece 
the action triggered a turkish invasion and the united nations 
has since policed the green line that divides the island 
a total of 1619 greeks and greek cypriots still are missing 
since the invasion and turkey has not accounted for their fate 
ozal is the first turkish premier to visit greece in 36 years 
in 1952 premier adnan menderes received a warm welcome in athens 
at a time of greekturkish detente 
the atmosphere is sharply different this time with 5000 greek 
police detailed to protect the turkish premier he will be confined 
mostly to one wing of the vouliagmeni hotel complex 
papandreou also is staying in the stateowned hotel on a 
peninsula jutting into the saronic gulf where he spends much of 
his time in the summer 
during the meetings two greek navy patrol boats cruise in the 
gulf and frogmen in rubber boats ride close to the shore 
the only sign that the turkish premier is visiting is a 
redandwhite turkish flag flying opposite a blueandwhite greek 
flag at the hotels front gate 
ozals visit is the latest move to improve relations after a 
greekturkish summit at the swiss ski resort of davos in january 
fifteen months ago greece and turkey nearly went to war over 
oildrilling rights in the aegean sea which apparently persuaded 
papandreou to change his hardline policy toward turkey

karajans name is important for the philharmonic said 
hassemer who has himself criticized the conductor for frequent 
cancellations of domestic concerts 
a senate committee had been reviewing its contract with karajan 
the orchestras conductor for life after he called off an 
appearance in berlin in april because of illness and then flew to 
japan for a 10day tour with the orchestra the next day 
karajan has suffered serious medical problems in recent years 
including severe back pains that have forced him to cancel 
conducting appearances 
but critics said several concerts were canceled under 
questionable circumstances 
philharmonic fans also complained in angry letters to newspapers 
about karajans infrequent appearances in berlin 
in november karajan announced he could not mount the podium in 
duesseldorf because he had food poisoning from tainted fish he 
later changed his mind and performed but called off his appearance 
in stuttgart during the same tour 
karajans berlin contract calls for him to conduct about a dozen 
concerts a year 
hassemer said the senate would make sure the contract was 
fulfilled in the future he did not elaborate

a landmark jury verdict gives a smokers 
widower 400000 in damages the first time a tobacco company has 
been ordered to pay money for disease caused by cigarettes 
but the three tobacco companies sued called the verdict a 
victory and the jurys award a vote of sympathy for the bereaved 
husband of rose cipollone who died of lung cancer after smoking 1 
packs a day for 40 years 
the us district court jury monday exonerated the cigarette 
makers liggett group inc lorillard inc and philip morris inc of 
conspiring to mislead the public about smokings dangers and 
rejected punitive damages 
instead it decided liggett failed to warn about the dangers of 
cigarettes and violated its promise or express warranty to 
produce a safe product 
it awarded antonio cipollone damages on the warranty claim but 
not for the failure to warn the public because it found his wife 
was 80 percent responsible for contracting the disease that killed 
her in 1984 at age 58 
liggett faced additional charges because it manufactured the 
chesterfields and lampms that mrs cipollone smoked before 1966 when 
congress ordered health warnings on cigarette packs mrs cipollone 
later used brands by lorillard and philip morris smoking even 
after having part of her lung removed in 1981 
liggett attorneys promised an appeal cipollones lawyers said 
they would ask the judge to overturn the decision not to award 
posthumous damages to mrs cipollone 
the 35 billion tobacco industry mounted an elaborate defense 
one analyst put the cost at 50 million to avoid a judgment that 
might unleash a flood of multimilliondollar lawsuits reaction to 
the verdict which followed five days of deliberations focused on 
its potential impact on hundreds of such cases pending around the 
nation 
cipollones attorneys said the decision showed the tobacco 
industry is not invincible 
any time a jury awards a 400000 verdict i dont think you 
can take it too lightly particularly in a situation where five 
years ago people thought we were crazy and when for the past 30 
years people have failed said marc z edell cipollones lawyer 
fewer than a dozen of about 300 smoker lawsuits have gone to 
juries and the tobacco industry has not paid a dollar in damages 
most of the other cases withered in the face of the wellheeled 
tobacco industrys legal forces 
all i know is that were not another notch in their gun 
said edell 
but some said the damages awarded might not be enough to 
encourage other lawsuits 
are you going to sue if all youre going to get is 400000 
asked tobacco industry analyst allan kaplan of merrill lynch in new 
york 
financial markets were closed when the verdict came in but 
kaplan predicted no longterm negative impact on tobacco stocks 
plaintiff attorneys cannot be encouraged by the small size of 
the award which pales in comparison to the 3 million they spent 
in time and money to try this case said a joint statement from 
peter bleakley of philip morris and robert northrip of lorillard 
both new york based 
the fact that the jury awarded no damages to mrs cipollone 
was a clear signal from the jury that smoking is a matter of 
personal choice and responsibility said alan hilburg spokesman 
for durham ncbased liggett 
liggett attorney donald cohn said he regarded the award as 
sympathy for cipollone a 64yearold retired cable splicer 
from lakehurst who pursued the lawsuit he had filed with his wife 
in 1983 
i believe that it is a victory for her cipollone said it 
wasnt 100 percent im glad that we won partial but its a 
start 
the jurors in the fourmonth trial would not discuss the verdict 
other than to say the process was emotional and nerve 
wracking 
antismoking groups viewed the verdict as a first step 
it destroys the myth of invulnerability and should lead to 
an increase in such lawsuits said richard daynard a northeastern 
university law professor who runs the tobacco products liability 
project a support group for litigation against tobacco companies 
what its going to do is encourage hundreds of smokers and 
their families to seek redress it has finally convinced lots of 
smokers that the evidence is clear he said 
to support the contention that liggett violated its promise to 
consumers of a safe product edell introduced advertisements for 
liggetts cigarettes from the 1950s 
one featured actress rosalind russell with the text reading 
rosalind russell says lampm filters are just what the doctor 
ordered others said nose throat and accessory organs not 
adversely affected by smoking chesterfields and play safe 
smoke chesterfields 
cipollones attorneys also introduced numerous secret corporate 
documents they said chronicled the inner workings of the industry 
for many antismoking forces disclosure of these documents into 
evidence was a victory 
the documents spoke of a gentlemans agreement not to do 
cancer research of an industry strategy to create doubt 
about the health charge without actually denying it and of a 
research program designed so that the results cannot harm the 
industry 
the companies denied the statements in the documents saying 
they represented the views of individuals and were taken out of 
context 
they contended that mrs cipollone knew the risks but chose to 
smoke anyway they also argued that smoking is not a proven cause 
of cancer and that her type of cancer hasnt been linked to 
cigarettes 
the defense managed to block many of cipollones claims 
including contentions that cigarette companies could be blamed for 
illnesses in smokers unaware of the dangers after the 1966 
warnings that the risk of cigarettes outweighed their usefulness 
and that the companies knew or should have known of a safer way to 
make cigarettes

an anchorage buildingmaterials 
supplier is taking advantage of a loophole in postal regulations to 
mail 6000 concrete blocks to a remote village 700 miles away 
the shipments across alaska could end up costing the us postal 
service 500000 and even the air carrier that stands to profit 
thinks the mail system is being abused 
sam krogstad of bush consolidators which specializes in sending 
construction materials via the mail says the postal services 
losses are partly selfinflicted because the postal system pays 10 
times as much to send the building materials by air freight as it 
charges krogstad to mail them 
each individually addressed concrete block costs krogstad 433 
in postage the same block costs the post office 5094 to deliver 
to wainwright an arctic ocean eskimo community about 90 miles 
southwest of barrow thats a subsidy of 4661 per block 
krogstad also is mailing 4600 bags of cement to wainwright 
the blocks each weigh 67 pounds and the bags of cement about 65 
pounds so they fall just under the parcelpost limit of 70 pounds 
to qualify as mail his postage costs will total about 45000 
the blocks and bags could have been shipped via air freight from 
anchorage for a little more than 210000 but the way mail is 
handled in rural alaska more than doubles the cost 
first the postal service trucks the blocks to fairbanks about 
360 miles they are then flown to barrow on large cargo planes 
transferred to small planes and flown to wainwright in loads of 18 
to 35 blocks 
the practice is called bypass mail because the shipment 
moves directly from sender to airline to addressee bypassing post 
offices 
this was not the intent of the bypass program says tim 
dorgan a postal service transportation supervisor the original 
intent of bypass mail was to clear the postal floor of large 
shipments of groceries and staples required for daytoday living 
but krogstad says the system means his shipments cost the postal 
service 76 cents a pound from fairbanks to wainwright instead of 
the 30 cents a pound that a charter flight from anchorage to 
wainwright would cost 
its ridiculous krogstad said its unamerican its got 
to be unconstitutional that a branch of the us government cant 
go out and competitively bid to get the best price on hauling the 
mail 
even one of the prime beneficiaries of the blocklift has 
misgivings 
were philosophically opposed to it says don brugman 
president of northern air cargo which is hauling many of the 
blocks and cement bags its not what the mail is for 
dorgan says hes worried the blocklift may put an end to bypass 
mail once word gets around the people in the bush are the ones 
who are going to suffer he said 
another problem says dorgan is that the blocklift may cause a 
backup of ordinary mail such as groceries bound for villages 
served from barrow 
the idea of mailing the materials was an angle that got us the 
job said bob gilman owner of gilco construction a contractor 
building a smallboat harbor at wainwright with the blocks 
he says he feels bad but it is just an angle and thats the 
nature of the business were in

alas tis poetic justice wrote the jurist 
perhaps disturbing your legal purists 
in a ruling that started with a poem us district judge h lee 
sarokin upheld a bankruptcy judges decision that kevin a 
rowlands filing for bankruptcy was no protection from an 8500 
award won against him by sean coughlin 
coughlin 27 won the award in his lawsuit against rowland who 
punched out his front teeth during a teenage fracas in bergenfield 
in 1979 according to sarokins opinion 
in his ruling monday sarokin wrote 
on this appeal the facts are undisputed mr rowlands punch 
caused mr coughlins teeth to be uprooted 
coughlin sued in the state court and won 
rowland filed in bankruptcy to get the debt undone 
the bankruptcy court found the assault to be a willful and 
malicious blow 
and the request to discharge the debt was answered no 
the bankruptcy court correctly decided that the debtor 
intended harm 
by propelling his fist into plaintiffs mouth with his arm 
this court agrees that bankruptcy law should not be enlarged 
so as to permit a judgment for assault and battery to be 
discharged 
to do so would require existing precedent to be spurned 
for these reasons the decision of the bankruptcy court will be 
affirmed

a landmark welfare bill aimed at using 
education jobs and training to help people break out of poverty is 
undergoing final adjustments as senators try to avert a 
presidential veto of the 26 billion fiveyear measure 
the family security act sponsored by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny reached the senate floor monday after 18 months 
in the making the painstaking groundwork produced a bipartisan 
bill cosponsored by nearly twothirds of the senate 
this bill is not far off from what i find most people want 
said sen bob packwood rore republican floor manager of the 
measure this is as good an effort as were likely to get out of 
this congress 
a more expensive house measure passed dec 17 
under the moynihan bill states would be required to set up 
education training and work programs and include as many 
participants as they could afford 
besides putting more welfare recipients to work the bill would 
force more absentee parents to pay child support and require states 
to provide at least six months of annual welfare benefits to poor 
households with two parents 
government checks would be a last resort an income supplement 
reserved for when parents could not contribute an adequate amount 
in child support or earned wages the bill would reverse the 
current system under which the check is the central and usually 
only element 
never has the senate considered so fundamental a redirection 
of the welfare system moynihan said 
key senators and their staffs started meeting monday with 
administration aides to discuss white house demands for several new 
provisions a presidential veto was threatened if administration 
demands were not met 
the administration wants the bill to give states broader 
authority to use federal money for experimental welfare schemes to 
require that a certain percentage of welfare recipients participate 
in jobs programs and to set up a new mandatory workfare program 
that senate minority leader bob dole rkan said could cost as 
much as 900 million 
aid to families with dependent children the current welfare 
system was begun in 1935 to help widows with children to raise 
the joint federalstate program now serves 37 families including 
7 million children and the recipients are no longer widows they 
are for the most part single or divorced mothers 
the nation is trying to make do with a rube goldberg welfare 
system developed during the depression to meet the needs of a 
society that no longer exists said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the senate finance committee lets not lose this 
opportunity to move our country forward 
among the provisions in the moynihan bill 
states would have to require parents to furnish social security 
numbers at the birth of their children meet minimum standards for 
establishing paternity set guidelines for child support awards 
and set procedures for immediate wage withholding from paychecks 
states would have to establish a jobs education and training 
program for welfare recipients with children age 3 or over or age 
1 at state option guarantee child care for participants and spend 
half their money on people who are longterm welfare recipients or 
are likely to be 
states would have to provide nine months of transitional child 
care assistance and a year of medicaid coverage for people moving 
off welfare into the workforce 
states would have to give welfare benefits to families with two 
parents in the home twentysix states already provide such 
benefits moynihans compromise would make six months a year 
mandatory in the other 24 states 
the federal share of the new expenses 26 billion over five 
years would be financed primarily by making permanent the tax 
refund withholding program for delinquent federal debtors and 
phasing out the dependent care tax credit for higherincome 
taxpayers

mubarak awad an arabamerican advocate of 
nonviolent resistance to israel arrived here after israel defied 
the united states and deported him from his birthplace of jerusalem 
the deportation ended a sevenmonth legal battle and made awad 
the 21st arab to be expelled by israel since the dec 8 start of 
the palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
awad 44 did not meet waiting reporters at kennedy 
international airport after his arrival monday night from israel 
but a spokesman made a brief statement on his behalf and said awad 
planned to a hold a news conference this afternoon 
he wanted me to express his deep appreciation to us 
officials who protested his deportation said charles kimball 
director of the middle east office of the national council of 
churches he named secretary of state george shultz assistant 
secretary of state richard murphy us ambassador to israel thomas 
pickering and counsuls general in israel morris draper and bill 
wilcox 
they have worked consistently arduously and enormously 
helpfully on his behalf from the beginning of this whole process 
and hes deeply grateful kimball said his words at times 
drowned out by the chanting of antiawad protesters 
the united states condemned israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs order that awad a us citizen be deported shamir 
alleged that awad played a key role in the arab uprising in the 
occupied territories 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday we think 
it is unjustifiable to deny mr awad the right to stay and live in 
jerusalem where he was born if he acted illegally he should have 
been charged and tried in court with full due process of law 
israel has regularly carried out deportations to quell unrest or 
subdue palestinian nationalist activity notably expelling nine 
west bank mayors between 1980 and 1982 but the number of 
deportations has greatly increased since the arab uprising began 
awad whom supporters call the palestinian gandhi denied 
inciting violence against israel but has supported the uprising in 
the territories israel captured in the 1967 middle east war 
although he has little influence in the palestinian community some 
tactics he advocates such as tax boycotts and commercial strikes 
were adopted by leaders of the uprising 
awad who was incarcerated 40 days in israel was kept away from 
reporters in jerusalem before he left but his letters to 
supporters from prison were distributed 
even after my departure my efforts will continue awad 
wrote we have no choice but to continue with the uprising for 
our liberation 
he vowed in the letters to return soon awad a christian has 
said he might convert to judaism as a means to return to israel 
his deportation was protested by about a dozen israelis at the 
jerusalem airport and 25 supporters in downtown jerusalem dozens 
of angry israelis staged an impromptu counterdemonstration calling 
the awad supporters traitors 
awad was deported on the grounds that his threemonth tourist 
visa issued when he entered israel last august had expired the 
israelis refused to extend the visa and the israeli supreme court 
last week rejected awads appeal to remain 
some 50 demonstrators about evenly split for and against awad 
gathered at kennedy airport 
new york state assemblyman dov hikind a brooklyn democrat led 
a group of protesters who shouted awad is a terrorist 
separated from the hikind group by a line of police officers was a 
proarab group shouting down down with israel and long live 
mubarak 
awad who lived in the united states for 13 years before 
returning to jerusalem in 1983 is the founder of the palestinian 
center for the study of nonviolence he has lectured on civil 
disobedience counseled teachers against corporal punishment and 
planted olive trees in west bank villages to underscore the arabs 
claim to the land 
he lived in wapakoneta ohio where he still owns a home his 
wife nancy nye flew to new york on sunday

pakistan keeps supplying afghan rebels while moscow withdraws its 
troops from afghanistan 
mondays warning was the first of its kind directly from the 
soviet leader it came in a joint statement with afghan president 
najib 
it followed reports from pakistan that said soviet forces 
returned to some cities in eastern afghanistan to fight guerrillas 
who raided posts defended by afghan troops 
the joint najibgorbachev statement distributed over the 
official tass news agency said the soviet union and afghanistan 
believed that the un mission monitoring compliance with the 
geneva accords would adopt effective measures to curb the 
practice of pakistan aiding the guerrillas which if continued 
would make it necessary to undertake the most resolute retaliatory 
steps 
in recent days the soviets have been warning pakistan and the 
united states that continuing to arm the guerrillas violated the 
accords signed in geneva in april under the accords the kremlin 
agreed to withdraw its more than 100000 troops from afghanistan by 
feb 15 and the withdrawal began may 15 
the red army intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 and has 
been helping the marxist government fight usbacked moslem rebels 
un mediator diego cordovez said monday that soviet troops were 
leaving afghanistan faster than we all expected 
thousands of soviet troops have already pulled out but cordovez 
refused to say exactly how many 
however pakistans un ambassador s shah nawaz said monday 
that the world will not be surprised if a crumbling afghan 
regime makes a desperate bid to retain the protective umbrella of 
foreign troops

dukakis running mate if the two can agree on key policy issues 
jackson said it was premature to discuss whether he will 
actively seek the vice presidential spot on the democratic national 
ticket 
but by virtue of his performance in the primaries weve 
earned the right for serious consideration and if there is a 
criteria by which one qualifies for consideration well pass it

the racial tensions in chicago are not representative of 
whats happening in american today jackson told the chicago

hundreds of radical students 
chanting antiamerican slogans demonstrated today at the edge of 
the demilitarized zone for reunification of north korea and south 
korea 
about 1300 students staged a sitdown protest in front of a 
bridge leading to the zone that divides the korean peninsula the 
bridge was blocked by steel barriers and rolls of barbed wire 
drive out yankees who hinder unification and advance 
unification students chanted 
the students denounced the government of president roh taewoo 
and yelled slogans calling on all south korean students to refuse 
compulsory weekly military training the training is required for 
all male students 
us army troops that normally guard the bridge were withdrawn 
before the students arrived today a few south korean personnel 
were seen guarding the bridge on the other side of the barriers 
the students from korea and joongang universities in seoul 
went to imjingak in a convoy of buses for a prayer ceremony for 
reunification they were accompanied by professors from the two 
schools to help ensure the demonstration was peaceful 
imjingak the last civilian area on the main road from seoul is 
about three miles from the southern edge of the demilitarized zone 
the government banned a march friday to the border with 
communist north korean by thousands of radical students seeking 
talks with north korean student delegates on reunification 
fierce street clashes erupted in seoul when riot police blocked 
radicals going to the border and about 900 students were arrested 
student leaders said todays demonstration described as a 
prayer ceremony for unification was different from fridays march 
since there were no plans to enter the demilitarized zone or meet 
with north korean representatives the south korean government says 
it alone can have contacts with the north 
the 2milewide zone separates the two koreas with the border 
running through the center forces of the two sides control their 
respective sides of the zone 
us troops help control the souths side of the zone across 
from imjingak and the panmunjom truce site that straddles the 
border 
students wanted to meet friday at panmunjom with north korean 
student delegates who reportedly were waiting there 
radical students have been demanding reunification of the korean 
peninsula divided since 1945 when us and soviet troops ended the 
japanese occupation at the end of world war ii 
south korea has been hit by a wave of violent antigovernment 
and antiamerican protests during the past month radical students 
battled riot police to press for overthrow of the roh government 
and reunification 
the radicals a small but powerful minority among south korean 
students claim the united states enforces partition of the 
peninsula to rule the south radicals demand withdrawal of the 
42000 us troops based in the south under a defense treaty 
the radicals have been unable to attract public support most 
south koreans fear the north is determined to conquer the 
peninsula north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the 
korean war

a federal appeals court decision that an illegal 
alien can sue his employer for nearly 50000 in unpaid wages 
blazes a trail for other rulings favoring immigrant workers a 
union official says 
the atlantabased 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled that 
rajni j patel an illegal alien from india is entitled to sue for 
unpaid back wages incurred during a threeyear period the decision 
reverses a us district court ruling last year throwing out the 
case which hinged on the courts interpretation of the us fair 
labor standards act 
the international ladies garment workers union supplied patel 
with legal help and filed a brief supporting him 
union spokesman john burke said the ruling not only vindicates 
patels claims but blazes a trail which we hope will lead to 
similar rulings on other fronts favorable to immigrants 
the appeals court cleared the way for patel to proceed with his 
lawsuit against a birmingham ala hotel where he worked as a 
maintenance man and janitor from 1982 to 1985 
patel in 1986 sued the quality inn south of birmingham and its 
owners sumani corp contending that the hotel violated wage and 
overtime laws and owed him 47132 in back pay plus damages and 
attorneys fees 
in march 1987 according to the appeals court opinion us 
district judge william m acker jr suggested to the hotels 
lawyers that they request a summary judgment to the effect that 
patel as an undocumented alien wasnt entitled to the protection 
of the fair labor standards act 
the hotels attorneys able to take a hint made such a 
request the 11th circuit noted and the judgment was issued 
against patel in may 1987 he appealed 
a threejudge panel of the 11th circuit court in an opinion 
released last week noted that the us supreme court has 
historically adopted an expansive definition of the term 
employee and that congress has clearly intended for 
undocumented aliens to be protected under the fair labor law 
patels case the 11th circuit court said falls under the law 
and nothing in the act purports to limit the remedy available to 
workers 
patel is not attempting to recover back pay for being 
unlawfully deprived of a job the appeals court wrote rather 
he simply seeks to recover unpaid minimum wages and overtime for 
work already performed

alaskan and soviet eskimos holding 
their first major reunion since the cold war imposed a forced 
separation 40 years ago sang and talked animatedly today about 
current events like walrus hunting 
the meeting at the palace of culture in this remote siberian 
port was one of the highlights of the 225mile friendship 
flight from the western alaska town of nome by an 82member us 
delegation 
timothy gologergen 68 of nome shared a traditional song with a 
siberian eskimo who identified himself as kaygigun 41 from the 
nearby village of new chaplino 
they got three walruses last night gologergen said later 
they were hauling them back and forth by dog team and he heard 
that we were coming he dropped everything and came over 
he said this way is really good just to speak our own 
yupik dialect and not listen to the war stories or think about 
war or plan about war just be doing our thing speaking our 
yupik language and hunting and being relaxed gologergen said 
the soviets earlier this month approved the charter flight by 
eskimos alaskan business leaders peace activists and politicians 
the product of two years work by alaskans 
eskimos once freely crossed the icy bering strait in motorboats 
and walrusskin umiaks to trade and visit with relatives the cold 
war ended all that in 1948 when the border was closed 
summit meetings between president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev helped make the friendship flight possible 
said bob clarke a state department official on the flight 
the summits were strong on peopletopeople exchanges 
clarke said this is a real grassroots effort 
the leader of the effort was james stimpfle a 40yearold nome 
real estate agent who dreamed up the flight two years ago to help 
thaw relations between alaska and siberia 
stimpfle said he wrote hundreds of letters to us and soviet 
officials trying to win acceptance for his idea of breaking down 
political barriers with good will 
theres security in friendship he said 
while eastern siberia is eight time zones away from moscow its 
only 3 miles from alaska at the closest point 
provideniya with about 5000 residents is a gray city of 
concreteblock apartments surrounded by mountains remnants of the 
winters packed ice still clog the fringes of the harbor like 
nome an old goldrush town of 3700 provideniya has no roads 
leading inland 
as the alaska airlines boeing 737 came to a halt on the gravel 
siberian runway schoolchildren waved soviet and us flags local 
officials and visitors shouted greetings in russian english and 
yupik over the roar of jets 
leaders of the alaskan delegation were handed carnations beneath 
a sign proclaiming peace and friendship between alaska and 
chukotka provideniya is in the district of chokotka 
formality soon gave way to a frenzy of hugs handshakes and 
trading of pins flags chewing gum and postcards 
the reunion came too late for john waghiyi 64 an eskimo born 
on st lawrence island 40 miles from the siberian coast who came 
looking for a distant relative on his fathers side but learned 
the man had died years ago 
waghiyi remembered visiting the relative as a young man 
the next year i was going to see him at gambell on st 
lawrence island he was going to give me a russian coat but they 
closed the russian border 
other potential reunions were aborted when a planned trip to a 
nearby native village was canceled by poor weather 
still waghiyi and others hoped the visit would clear the way 
for more interchanges between alaska and siberia gologergen said 
that governments willing the siberian eskimos would visit alaska 
we were like east and western germany before said waghiyi 
we were like behind the iron curtain now were going to be in 
their front yard

lucien cardin who precipitated a parliamentary 
crisis in 1966 as justice minister in the liberal government of 
prime minister lester pearson died at his home after a long battle 
with cancer he was 69 
cardin who died monday had been a judge of the tax court of 
canada since 1983 
first elected to parliament as liberal member from quebec in 
1952 cardin was reelected six times before deciding not to run in 
the 1968 general election 
after the liberals under pearson formed a government in 1963 
cardin was appointed associate defense minister then public works 
minister and finally justice minister 
his troubles as justice minister began in 1965 when he confirmed 
on television that victor spencer a vancouver postal clerk had 
been spying for the soviet union 
spencer had admitted to spying and was fired by the post office 
without a pension he wasnt prosecuted because he was dying of 
cancer 
the opposition in parliament contended that spencer shouldnt 
have been fired without being prosecuted cardin defended the 
governments position 
to save his government pearson had to agree to an opposition 
demand for an investigation into the loss of spencers pension 
the scandal grew when cardin under opposition attack for the 
liberals handling of security cases replied on march 4 1966 
that the opposition had no business talking cardin then mentioned 
an embarrassing case involving the conservatives 
pearson had asked the royal canadian mounted police in 1964 for 
all files on members of parliament in which security was involved 
as a result he had been briefed on gerda munsinger a german 
callgirl and suspected soviet agent who was considered a security 
problem because of an affair with pierre sevigny at the time 
sevigny was associate defense minister in the conservative 
government of prime minister john diefenbaker 
pearson had discussed the munsinger affair privately with 
diefenbaker but cardins blurted reference in parliament was the 
first public disclosure 
pearson appointed a justice of canadas supreme court to look 
into the matter which aroused concern in the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
cardin resigned as justice minister in 1967 he was member of 
the immigration appeal board from 1970 to 1972 and served on the 
tax review board that eventually became the tax court of canada 
he is survived by his wife marcelle and four children

battling southern baptists headed 
toward a showdown decision that would either curb rule of their 
146million member denomination by fundamentalists or perpetuate 
it for the next generation 
more than at any time since the fundamentalist tide began 
rolling nine years ago moderates seemed to feel they had an even 
chance of breaking it at this years convention which meets today 
they have a chance because they have a good candidate said 
toby a druin of dallas assistant editor of the weekly baptist 
standard referring to the prospective moderate nominee for the 
denominational presidency 
the rev richard jackson the moderate from phoenix ariz is 
expected to be pitted against fundamentalist candidate jerry vines 
a minister from jacksonville fla 
the nominations and voting for president of the denomination 
the nations largest protestant body come this afternoon 
its going to be neck and neck said the rev albert 
mcclellan of nashville tenn retired longtime denominational 
executive 
through successive presidencies whose appointments gradually 
determine ruling trustees of the denominations farflung 
operational network fundamentalists nearly have completed their 
takeover 
their timetable says one more year would seal the process 
but moderates see signs that many who have supported 
fundamentalists before think they have gone to excess in newly 
restrictive measures on institutions and agencies driving out some 
widely respected personnel 
indications also have arisen of links between fundamentalist 
strategists and the religious right on socialpolitical issues 
that gives the conflict a broad political tinge rather than it 
being an intramural difference over bible interpretation as it 
often has been pictured 
people are becoming alarmed mcclellan said theres a 
definite swing against these extremes 
however some peculiar backstage maneuvering has gone on that 
possibly could scuttle the expected contest between jackson and 
vines 
the rev john bisagno of houston suggested that to dampen the 
headon conflict only one of the two be nominated as a consensus 
candidate this year the other two years hence 
that seemed unlikely but the possibility was discussed that 
bisagno himself might be nominated which probably would reduce 
chances of the moderatebacked jackson 
a hint of fundamentalist strength also came in a preconvention 
pastors conference monday afternoon when a fundamentalist the rev 
ralph smith of austin was elected president 
he defeated a moderate the rev paul powell of tyler 
the presidency of the pastors conference has been a stepping 
stone to the convention presidency for the last decade 
among the fundamentalist engineered steps that have intensified 
controversy during the last year 
endorsement of judge robert bork for the us supreme court 
contrary to longtime denominational policy against siding for or 
against specific candidates the conservative bork later withdrew 
from the nomination 
adopting mission board policies against women clergy and 
divorced ministers in most cases and instituting screening of 
personnel to assure that they took a literalist view of the bible 
moves that drove from office the rev randall lolley as 
president of southeastern baptist theological seminary in wake 
forest nc and the rev larry baker as head of the 
denominations ethics agency the christian life commission 
ouster of the rev george sheridan as head of a regional new 
jersey interfaith unit because he contended that gods covenant 
with jews remained valid 
pushing rightwing causes for capital punishment prayer in 
public schools aid to religious schools and against all abortions 
except to save the mothers life

a us supreme court ruling on vaccine liability 
focused on the only common vaccine that can cause the disease it is 
intended to prevent experts say 
the court ruled monday that the federal government may be forced 
to pay damages for polio resulting from the oral vaccine for that 
disease 
but in general side effects from vaccines are rare and its 
far better to be vaccinated than to get the disease said g 
scott giebink professor of pediatrics at the university of 
minnesota medical school 
here are common vaccines and their side effects 
oral polio vaccine which is given twice in the first year of 
life with boosters in the second year and just before entering 
school it has no side effects other than rare cases of polio 
paralysis which occurs in about one out of every 32 million doses 
of vaccine giebink said 
the paralytic reaction is most common in people with hampered 
immune systems either the vaccinated child or a family member of a 
vaccinated child he said the weakened virus used in the vaccine 
can pass to a family member possibly causing trouble if that 
persons immune system is weakened he said 
diphtheriatetanuspertussis vaccine given at ages two 
months four months six months 15 months and at entry to school 
pertussis is whooping cough 
about one in 110000 children who get the dtp vaccine develop a 
brain dysfunction that can include seizures it is usually 
temporary but about one in 310000 vaccinated children get 
permanent damage that includes mental retardation or movement 
difficulties according to the centers for disease control 
whether those problems are caused by the vaccine is 
controversial said samuel katz chairman of the pediatrics 
department at the duke university medical center 
giebink said they appear to be linked to the vaccine because its 
more mild side effects may lead to a doctors examination which 
uncovers the serious problem that may gone unnoticed before the 
inoculation 
the mild side effects include muscle soreness and swelling at 
the injection site which occur in about half the injections and 
fever in about onefifth of immunizations he said about one in 
2000 children develops a fever and convulsions without lasting 
effects he said 
haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine given at age 18 months 
the disease being prevented is a potentially fatal infection that 
can cause brain damage pneumonia and other effects 
the vaccine has no serious side effects giebink said fewer 
than 1 percent of recipients get a fever and one in five have arm 
soreness or tenderness 
measlesmumpsrubella vaccine given at age 15 months no 
serious side effects are known although in very rare cases a spell 
of fever and convulsions can follow the shot giebink said 
some children get a rash or slight fever lasting a few days 
about one in seven have a mild swelling of lymph glands in the 
neck about one in 50 teenage or adult women experience a 
shortlived aching or swelling of joints he said 
influenza vaccine given mostly to people in highrisk groups 
such as those with chronic lung or heart disease and the elderly 
despite publicity about a paralysis called guillainbarre syndrome 
associated with swine flu vaccines in 1976 flu vaccines in general 
cause no serious side effects giebink and katz said

delicate threads are linking the affluent suburbs 
of chicago and the povertyridden slums of india in a project 
started by an indian social worker 
pushpika freitas 31 describes her plan to market the clothing 
and other handiwork of her native land as capitalism with a 
conscience 
what were doing is not only selling products and helping 
people in india but also educating some of the people here about 
the different conditions there said ms freitas in a recent 
interview 
theres the whole aspect of brotherhood and sisterhood 
identifying with people on the other side of world who live in very 
bad conditions but would really want to change their lives or 
improve themselves 
ms freitas who divides her time between bombay and chicago 
founded the nonprofit group called marketplace handwork of 
india in 1986 to provide a marketing outlet in the united states 
for the handmade crafts and clothing items 
since then the volunteer agency has promoted the sale of about 
20000 worth of goods in the united states mostly through homes 
and churches in chicagos northern suburbs 
its first major experiment with a retail shop came this year 
through nomads an import handcraft store in suburban evanston 
more than 2500 worth of the brightly colored patchwork and 
intricately embroidered cotton clothing bags and table mats has 
been sold since the items went on display may 14 
its gone very well and we intend to continue what has 
been a good relationship said catharine cole nomads owner 
about 45 percent to 50 percent of the money from the sales goes 
back to the indian cooperatives that make the items the rest 
covers shipping fees duties and promotional and office expenses 
ms freitas said indian women who work as domestic servants earn 
only about 15 to 20 a month for working 8 to 10 hours a day 7 
days a week through the cooperatives she said they can double 
their earnings while working at home 
ms freitas has been involved with the cooperatives since she 
returned to her native bombay in 1979 after receiving her masters 
degree in sociology from chicagos de paul university where her 
husband is a political science professor 
she found women in bombay to be the poorest of the poor 
unskilled and uneducated 
but she also found them motived to keep their families going 
being a woman i empathized with their situation and wanted to 
do something about this she said 
so in 1980 ms freitas founded a patchwork cooperative with 
three women in bombays golibar slum district who made quilts 
cushion covers and garments 
now the patchwork center provides work for 35 women who pick up 
materials and instructions and work at home on a piecework basis 
there also are three other workshops employing 30 poor women and 
handicapped men those workshops are a sewing shop a handblock 
fabric printing shop and a silk screen shop where workers are 
trained to make stationery and ornamental paper 
in 1985 ms freitas helped launch a nonprofit coalition of 
cottage industries called share or support the handicapped 
rehabilitation effort it now works with about 25 cooperatives 
around india helping them with professional advice on sales and 
marketing 
all these things are important otherwise these programs are 
like charity under a different name ms freitas said its 
teaching a man to fish rather than providing the fish 
the cooperatives produce goods like flowing caftain dresses 
needlepoint belts embroidered blouses and stationery sets for 
export 
many shirts and skirts go for 16 and the most expensive items 
are huge quilts that cost 200 to 250 
ms freitas plans to introduce a mail order catalog by next 
year she acknowledges that its been hard to interest major 
retailers who are looking for bulk orders and uniform designs but 
she believes in her project 
i am convinced that the products can really take off here in 
the united states and make some significant changes in 
india she said

its design allows engineers to strap on different configurations of 
solid and liquid boosters tailoring the vehicle to a clients 
specific budget and needs the agency said 
developed over the past six years at a cost of 575 million 
ariane4 can carry a maximum load of 46 tons into orbit ariane3 
the previous generation had a maximum capacity of 28 tons 
arianespace already hauls half the worlds commercial payloads 
as of may 25 the company held 67 launch contracts worth 34 
billion 
the united states and japan have barely entered the race but in 
the coming years arianespace faces competition from the american 
titan4 made by martin marietta corp atlascentaur built by 
general dynamics and delta made by mcdonnell douglas as well as 
from the soviet proton the chinese long march and the japanese 
h2 now under development 
the united states had been depending on its space shuttles as 
the chief launchers of commercial satellites until jan 28 1986 
when the shuttle challenger exploded just after liftoff killing 
all seven crew members 
there has not been a shuttle launch since the next one is 
expected late this summer 
even when the shuttles resume regular flights their focus will 
be on military and scientific missions rather than commercial 
operations 
however the delta2 will begin commercial flights this fall 
with the titan3 scheduled to begin early next year the 
atlascentaur is scheduled to take off with paying customers in the 
middle of 1989 
previously us rockets lifted mostly military and scientific 
loads under supervision of the us air force or the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
arianespace officials consider the titan rocket their toughest 
competitor in the world market of about 25 launches a year the 
titan is the only us rocket able to haul satellites weighing more 
than 27 tons 
the main us challenger may turn out to be the new delta2 
which will be bigger and more powerful than the current model 
arianespace plans to build and launch 70 of their new rockets 
between now and 1995 when the ariane5 will be ready to fly 
one of the three satellites due to be sent into space on 
wednesday the meteostatp2 will be placed in orbit to furnish 
weather data to 16 european countries 
the 1529pound satellite will monitor weather over most of 
europe africa the middle east and the eastern half of south 
america it replaces meteostatf2 launched in 1981 which until 
recently sent back pictures of earth every half hour 
the 330pound amsat3c known by the nickname oscar13 will 
serve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world 
pas1 a satellite owned by the american telecommunications 
company pan american satellite will further telecommunications 
service at a moderate cost between latin america the united states 
and europe 
it also will provide some latin american countries with the 
ability to create national television networks

a drug used for 20 years to lower 
cholesterol and prevent blood clotting may help block aids 
infection according to preliminary tests in a us government 
laboratory 
the drug called dextran sulfate protected immune system cells 
from aids infection for more than two weeks in the laboratory said 
hiroaki mitsuya of the us national institutes of health he 
reported his findings monday at the fourth international conference 
on aids 
the first phase of human trials of the drug has just been 
completed at san francisco general hospital where doctors say it 
is too soon to know whether it will perform as well in patients as 
it does in the laboratory 
for the most part the drug was well tolerated by the 
experimental subjects said dr donald abrams director of the 
study 
some of the 30 patients who received varying doses of the drug 
for up to eight weeks showed signs of liver abnormalities a 
lowering of white blood cell count and hyperexcitability but 
there were no major side effects he said 
the study was designed only to determine whether the drug was 
safe to give to aids patients abrams said it is not approved for 
use in the united states but it has been used in japan and 
elsewhere as an anticoagulant and cholesterollowering agent 
abrams said 
the researchers did notice however that the drug produced 
slight elevation in the number of t4 cells in the subjects abrams 
said these cells are controllers of the bodys immune system and 
they are a principal target of the aids virus which kills them 
many aids victims are obtaining dextran sulfate through illicit 
channels and taking it on their own which could be risky abrams 
said 
many of these patients are also taking azt which can extend 
life the problem is that azt is broken down in the liver and 
dextran sulfate might disrupt liver function abrams said thus 
aggravating potentially serious side effects associated with azt 
mitsuya who works in the laboratory of dr samuel broder one 
of the leaders in the search for antiaids drugs said the 
laboratory studies suggest dextran sulfate blocks the first step in 
aids infection the attachment of the aids virus to the outside of 
the t4 cells 
combinations of dextran sulfate and azt suppress aids infection 
in the laboratory even better than either drug does alone mitsuya 
said 
the virus of acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the 
bodys immune system and leaves victims susceptible to a wide 
variety of infections and cancers 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or 
blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles 
or syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth

marlise ricardos a drama major at the 
university of southern california was crowned miss california in a 
finale marred when another contestant pulled out a banner saying 
pageants hurt all people 
michelle anderson 21 who represented santa cruz county was 
pulled from the stage by security guards monday night as she yelled 
that the winner had bruises all over her body because she suffered 
from a weightloss illness anorexia 
the 26yearold winner who wore the banner of the city of 
lomita had little to say about the incident 
theres nothing i can really say at this moment that would be 
in good taste so id rather not comment but she and i dont see 
eye to eye said miss ricardos 
the 65th miss california pageant was the third at the san diego 
civic center where it was moved from santa cruz after protests 
with crowds up to 1000 marred previous contests 
ten finalists chosen from a pool of 42 during preliminary 
contests over the weekend participated in the finals televised 
around the state the judges rated the women on the basis of 
swimsuit and talent competition and interviews 
miss anderson who wasnt one of the finalists said she had 
planned all year to stage the protest 
the whole point is that pageants hurt all women miss 
anderson said outside the civic center they hurt women who are 
on the inside because they are bruised psychologically and 
physically by what they must endure to become queens 
pageants hurt women on the outside because the contestants 
are an icon that we must all look up to and that were all supposed 
to emulate but that makes us unhealthy and promotes anorexia and 
bulimia and cosmetic surgery 
miss ricardos will represent the state in the miss america 
pageant in atlantic city in september she also won 20000 in 
scholarships wardrobe money and gifts 
miss ricardos first runner up the past two years said she 
would use the money to further her college education and career 
she sang i dreamed a dream during the talent competition 
its extremely exciting because ive been working on this for 
six years miss ricardos said of the pageant its a wonderful 
way for women to pay for their education 
in previous years pageant protesters have focused on racism and 
sexism they say is promoted by the contest but with the contest 
itself 65yearsold protesters said they decided to focus on age 
discrimination 
were here to celebrate womens diversity said ann 
simonton a 35yearold former model who led the protest by a santa 
cruzbased group mediawatch 
ms simonton covergirl of the 1974 sports illustrated swimsuit 
edition who has been arrested several times during previous 
protests wore a trash can with a banner that read miserable 
i feel older women are ignored to a large degree in our 
society and theyre relegated to a trash can which is why im 
emphasizing it by being dressed this way ms simonton said 
several dozen demonstrators wearing makeup worn clothes and 
wigs carried signs saying slaves to stereotypes theres 
life at 44 and beauty comes in all types of packages 
about a dozen police officers monitored the protests there were 
no arrests 
pageant organizers say the contest promotes the things for women 
that protesters want better education and equality in the work 
place

in a major step toward a unified european 
market the european economic communitys finance ministers agreed 
to remove all controls on capital flow within the common market 
starting in 1990 
mondays accord will let eec citizens open bank accounts and 
obtain other financial services such as loans in any of the 12 
common market member nations 
eec officials said this will spur more competition among banks 
and create a single financial market competitive in size with the 
united states and japan 
creation of this large financial area should make it 
possible for eec banks to catch up with the financial centers in 
tokyo and new york said jacques delors president of the eecs 
executive commission 
the accord figures in the eecs internal market plan under 
which all internal borders that still hamper a free flow of people 
goods and services are to by removed by 1992 
the freedom of capital flows is an important step toward 
creation of a european market and a monetary union west german 
finance minister gerhard stoltenberg the meetings chairman told 
reporters 
removal of the money controls is to take effect in eight of the 
eecs most developed nations on july 1 1990 
greece portugal spain and ireland may retain their controls 
until the end of 1992 and greece and portugal will be allowed to 
extend the transition period until 1995 
of the other eight only france italy and denmark still 
maintain strict controls on capital the others already have fully 
liberalized their capital markets 
the accord was reached despite lastminute concerns by france 
and denmark that the measure would encourage tax evasion and fraud 
finance minister pierre beregovoy of france first sought to link 
the capital liberalization to a requirement the eec mandate equal 
tax levels throughout the trade bloc 
this was firmly rejected by nigel lawson britains chancellor 
of the exchequer who said it would force his country to levy 
unpopular sales taxes on food childrens clothing and other items 
in the end the ministers asked the eec commission to study the 
issue and make any tax equalization proposals by june 30 1989 but 
a vote on these must be unanimous effectively giving britain a 
veto right while the accord to free capital flows would proceed on 
schedule regardless of the outcome 
all in all it was a useful days work lawson told 
reporters after the meeting the liberalization of capital 
markets goes ahead on schedule 
its very happy news because if we had not managed to come to 
an agreement today it would have put the creation of a unified 
internal market in the eec by 1992 in a very bad light said an 
eec commission official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the ministers also resolved objections by denmark which feared 
the accord would interfere with very strict reporting of interest 
payments to the tax authorities 
officials said it was agreed that danes with bank accounts 
elsewhere in the eec must continue to report the bank account to 
danish authorities and promise to let the bank provide all 
requested information to the tax authorities 
the ministers also resolved a variety of other concerns of 
spain portugal greece and ireland which have highly protected 
banking sectors and which expressed fears of massive capital 
outflows in a free market 
under the accord countries may impose temporary capital curbs 
for up to six months in periods of stress without prior approval 
from the eec commission after that sixmonth period the controls 
must be reviewed and approved by the commission 
the ministers also provided for a fund of 192 billion to help 
central banks cope with any imbalances in capital flows resulting 
from the new legislation 
the accord must now be approved by the european parliament but 
officials said that was a formality

iranian gunboats attacked a 
singaporeflagged oil tanker with machine guns and set it on fire 
today in the persian gulf shipping executives reported 
it was the second time in four days that iranians raided a 
tanker near irans farsi island off saudi arabias coast 
the shipping sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
identified todays target as the 87768ton neptune subaru no 
casualties were reported 
they said its asian crew including a sri lankan captain and 
sailors from malaysia singapore and india put out the fires and 
the vessel sailed under its own power to the saudi arabian port of 
jubail for inspection 
the neptune subaru was also hit by the iranians in the strait of 
hormuz gateway to the gulf in march the executives said 
the tanker was empty and heading for kuwait for a shipment of 
crude oil when the gunboats opened fire early today in a 45minute 
raid 
farsi island is a base for irans revolutionary guards who 
often attack ships sailing to and from kuwait they also have been 
blamed for mining the waterway 
the us navy has mounted a major minesweeping operation and 
sent several warships to patrol in the area it was not immediately 
clear if any us warship was nearby when the neptune subaru was 
attacked today 
the vessel was about 40 miles west of farsi near the saudi 
island of hurqus iran had attacked several ships in that area 
earlier in the socalled tanker war an offshoot of the 
7yearold gulf war 
in the exchanges iraq attacks irans vital oil shipping lanes 
to try to throttle its foes economy iran retaliates by raiding 
neutral vessels mainly those trading with kuwait or saudi arabia 
the persian state accuses these two oil powers of aiding iraqs 
military effort 
shipping sources said the skipper of the neptune subaru appeared 
to be on his first trip into the gulf 
this captain like others we encounter came to the gulf with 
no prior knowledge whatsoever about the dangers of the tanker war 
or what precautions should be taken against ship attacks said a 
shipping official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
on saturday the iranians attacked the usowned 
britishflagged esso demetia supertanker about 120 miles south of 
where the neptune subaru was raided a us frigate rushed to the 
scene but its help was not needed 
kuwait registered 11 of its tankers in the united states last 
year to entitle them to us warship protection 
the pentagon recently broadened the task of the us navy in the 
gulf by allowing warships to intervene in attacks on foreign 
commercial ships 
before the new policy went into effect may 3 the navy was 
allowed to offer only humanitarian assistance 
but iran has struck seven vessels in the waterway since then in 
apparent defiance of the navy

a bank robber dubbed the 
gentleman bandit because of his penchant for threepiece suits 
and his softspoken manner in dozens of holdups has changed his 
clothes and his pattern says the fbi 
the robber whos averaged one to three holdups a month since 
his 30bank spree in georgia and south florida began in 1986 
pulled his last heist in naples on march 21 fbi spokesman paul 
miller said in asking the public for help monday 
it does look like his pattern has been broken but whether 
hes been arrested for something else or is sick from narcotics 
abuse we dont know miller said thats part of the reason we 
want to get some publicity 
the bandit who is about 30 years old could be pulling the 
robberies to feed a drug habit miller said investigators base 
that theory on photographs taken during robberies that show the man 
growing thinner 
the bandit also has recently stowed his threepiece suit for 
more casual garb and has shaved off his beard fbi officials said 
the robber usually carries a folder or accordiontype briefcase 
miller said while the softspoken man has threatened bodily harm 
in notes to tellers he rarely displays a weapon and no one has 
been hurt 
thousands of dollars have been taken but miller did not give an 
amount 
because of the robbers mobility and familiarity with different 
cities and exit routes investigators believe he has a legitimate 
job possibly as a traveling salesman miller said 
investigators speculate the man does not live near the banks he 
robs because no one has come forward to help identify him even 
though robbery photos have been publicized 
were hoping somebody who owns a motel or a hotel might 
recognize him as a steady client miller said

many armenians who joined a strike to demand 
annexation of a disputed region of neighboring azerbaijan returned 
to work today after being assured that their republics government 
would press their demand 
but the azerbaijani government voted to reject ceding control of 
the nagornokarabakh region which is predominantly armenian 
mofses gorgisyan an armenian jailed in april and may for 
staging nationalist demonstrations said a general strike shut down 
most businesses in armenia on monday but that today some people 
are working maybe half 
he said students agitating for annexation had for three weeks 
staged a sitin outside the opera theater in yerevan capital of 
the southern republic 
nagornokarabakh was assigned to azerbaijan in 1923 most 
azerbaijanis are moslems and most armenians are christians 
azerbaijans official baku radio reported today that the 
executive committee of that republics legislature met monday in 
the azerbaijani capital baku and turned down a request by 
nagornokarabakh officials that their territory be transferred to 
armenia 
the report monitored by the british broadcasting corp in 
london said the presidium of the republics supreme soviet found 
the demand unacceptable because it would be contrary to the 
interests of the azerbaijani and armenian population of the 
republic and would be incompatible with the tasks of consolidating 
the friendship between all the peoples of our country as well as 
with the task of reconstruction 
it said the annexation request came from the nagornokarabakh 
autonomous regions soviet of peoples deputies one of two 
chambers of the regions legislature a request from the same body 
in february touched off massive street demonstrations and strikes 
in nagornokarabakh and yerevan 
armenias legislature is to meet wednesday to discuss the 
annexation demand 
armenias new communist party leader suren arutyunyan told 
more than 500000 demonstrators in yerevan on monday that the 
armenian supreme soviet would decide positively on their claim 
according to gorgisyan and sergei grigoryants a dissident 
journalist in moscow 
gorgisyan quoted arutyunyan as saying a majority of supreme 
soviet deputies indicated they support annexation he said the 
speech was replayed three times on armenian television apparently 
in an effort to persuade people to return to their jobs 
since the azerbaijani legislature has rejected the annexation 
demand if the armenian supreme soviet calls for transfer of 
nagornokarabakh the issue would have to be decided by the central 
government in moscow 
moscow officials have rejected the demand once 
gorgisyan said armenians believe the next move is up to moscow 
we are interested in moscows answer moscow has been silent so 
far 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev got involved in the issue in 
february appealing to armenians and azerbaijanis to be calm and 
promising the dispute would be reviewed 
the kremlin later rejected the annexation demand and the central 
government instead approved a package of social and cultural 
improvements for nagornokarabakh 
according to gorgisyan three armenians have been lying on the 
square outside the opera theater on a hunger strike since june 4 
he estimated that 2000 to 5000 people were gathered on the 
square where the latest round of demonstrations began may 25 
a worker at the yerevan hotel said the general strike was still 
on and demonstrators were making speeches and holding posters 
its very peaceful people are highly cultured said the 
worker the phone conversation was cut off before a reporter could 
ask the womans name 
the ethnic dispute has erupted into violence several times in 
late february and early march 32 people mostly armenians were 
killed in riots in the azerbaijani city of sumgait 
on monday foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
an azerbaijani officer was killed by shotgun fire from an armenian 
during protests in baku he did not say precisely when the shooting 
occurred 
there were unconfirmed reports saturday of largescale protests 
in baku 
also monday the party leader of azerbaijan abdul rahman 
vezirov told workers in baku that they were correct in resisting 
armenians demands to give up nagornokarabakh 
communist party authorities put vezirov in charge of azerbaijan 
and arutyunyan in charge of armenia on may 21 apparently firing 
their predecessors for not containing the dispute

eighteen of the 100 executions since the us supreme court 
reinstated the death penalty have been in louisiana which is tied 
with florida for the secondhighest number nationally texas has 
put 27 people to death 
thirtyseven states enacted capital punishment laws after the 
1976 supreme court ruling 
a coroner pronounced byrne dead at 1212 am said jim morris 
deputy secretary of the louisiana department of public safety and 
corrections 
three state and federal courts monday refused requests by 
byrnes lawyers to block the execution louisianas pardon board 
also refused to recommend a commutation of his sentence to life 
imprisonment 
six procapital punishment demonstrators waited outside the 
prison for confirmation of byrnes death one held a sign reading 
thanks sam jones alluding to the pseudonym used by officials 
to protect the anonymity of the executioner 
the signcarrier identified himself as johnny reece of 
pineville he said he felt deprived because the man who killed his 
16yearold stepdaughter was sentenced to life imprisonment 
it gives us a sense of justice to see this done to him 
byrne reece said it doesnt make me happy to see someone 
die but it gives me a sense of satisfaction to see justice 
served 
byrne showed no emotion when he entered the death chamber asked 
if he had any final words byrne smirked shook his head and 
replied nope 
after he was strapped into the electric chair and masked byrne 
drummed his fingers while awaiting the first of four surges of 
electricity 
byrne who was convicted of firstdegree murder insisted he 
never intended to kill roberta johnson 25 who was bludgeoned with 
a hammer during the 7000 robbery at the bossier city service 
station 
i dont know exactly what it is that i can say to yall i was 
planning to rob this woman all along it was all set up there were 
no flaws that i could see byrne said in a pardon board hearing 
monday at the penitentiary 
defense attorneys and a university professor who came to know 
byrne portrayed him as a penitent killer and as a sensitive 
articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to 
loved ones 
it was a premeditated robbery but not a premeditated murder 
this was a robbery that went sour defense attorney nancy 
baumgartner said 
but district attorney henry brown called byrne manipulative 
roguish and cruel 
brown said byrne was caught in a hotel room the morning after 
the killing with a barmaid he had picked up at a tavern and 
proposed marriage to parked outside was a car byrne had stolen 
from the woman he lived with before getting involed with johnson 
the prosecutor said 
byrnes court appeals were based on numerous arguments among 
them that he should have had 90 days to appeal an adverse federal 
appeals court ruling handed down may 9 
but those arguments were turned aside monday by the louisiana 
supreme court the 5th us circuit court of appeals and finally 
the us supreme court 
hilton butler warden of the louisiana state penitentiary said 
byrne spent monday alone or with his lawyers butler described 
byrne as calm monday night gov buddy roemer made no effort to 
intervene in the first execution since he took office in march

police stormed a barricaded church run by 
a fundamentalist minister taking custody of some of his supporters 
and residents of the home for troubled youths he operated 
at least seven people including the churchs assistant pastor 
were arrested monday at bethel baptist church authorities said 
at least three dozen children were taken from the church after 
about 60 state troopers local police officers and sheriffs 
deputies entered it following a fourhour standoff witnesses said 
law officers who were searching for three children who returned 
to the home after a judge temporarily closed it moved into the 
white woodframe church after unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a 
settlement 
as officers entered the building some church members sang hymns 
and quoted scripture some asked if this isnt nazi germany 
what is 
the state department of public welfare took custody of 11 
children after they were interviewed but it was uncertain if all 
had been former residents of the bethel home for children 
authorities said they took all the youngsters in the church 
because church officials refused to point out the three who had 
returned to the home after its closing 
bethel baptists pastor the rev herman fountain was arrested 
twice monday the first time along with two staff members and a 
17yearold after a fight broke out at the home 
the second arrest came after fountain got involved in a shoving 
match with a law officer outside the courthouse 
on friday chancery judge robert oswald ordered all the 
residents of the school temporarily placed in state custody 
oswald ruled that the children ages 10 to 17 had been 
subjected to physical abuse medical neglect and detention 
amounting to imprisonment 
the public welfare department removed 64 children but many 
others fled the home twentytwo of the 64 were released over the 
weekend to parents or guardians state officials said 
on monday oswald began hearing the cases of the 42 youngsters 
placed in state custody 
fountain refused to respond to oswalds questions about the 
whereabouts of the runaways and the judge issued 11 subpoenas to 
the homes staff members 
fountain returned to the campus in the early afternoon and told 
staff members not to comply with the subpoenas 
after the shoving match fountain with no shoes his hair and 
clothes ruffled was returned to court where he told oswald that 
he was sheltering three children but would answer no other 
questions 
oswald asked fountain to help prevent any bloodshed or 
violence but the baptist minister said there was nothing he 
could do 
after the report of the campus fracas in which fountain was 
arrested oswald asked that a grand jury be called to consider 
whether fountain should be indicted for obstruction of justice 
oswald said at the end of the day he had released seven children 
to their parents after reviewing their cases he said they agreed 
not to send their children back to the school without court 
approval 
earlier fountain said he believed the home had housed about 120 
children he said he did not know the whereabouts of those missing 
the number of children at large was unknown because fountain 
refused to honor a court order to provide a list with names and 
addresses of the children and their parents 
outside court several parents said they wanted their children 
back in the home rather than the states custody 
pat green of boca raton fla who said she had a 16yearold 
son at bethel said she and her husband refused to pick him up 
because they did not want to sign the agreement that would bar him 
from returning to the home 
brother fountain through bethel saved our childs life she 
said when a child is on drugs you need the help of religion to 
get off drugs 
state welfare commissioner thomas brittain said saturday that 
medical examinations of some children showed excessive use of 
corporal punishment

the dollar was little changed in europe this 
morning as markets awaited the release later in the day of us 
trade data gold made slight gains 
dealers said the dollar might strengthen if forecasters were 
correct in predicting an increase in the us trade gap from 1195 
billion in march to a seasonally adjusted 122 billion in april 
one dealer in frankfurt said this would leave the dollar room to 
rise but another said 
there was a lot of optimism after the last trade figures 
but the new figures will remind the market that the deficit is 
still around and that it wont fall below 10 billion any time 
soon and the central banks dont want the dollar to rise either 
a dealer in milan commented any result above 12 billion will 
just remind traders how stubborn a problem the us trade imbalance 
is

a series of small to moderate 
earthquakes that have shaken california from nearly one end to the 
other the past few days are unrelated a seismologist says 
the latest quake measuring 30 on the richter scale shook this 
coastal community monday no injuries or damage were reported said 
robert finn spokesman for the california institute of technologys 
seismology lab in pasadena 
it followed a 23 magnitude quake monday morning centered in the 
playa del rey area near los angeles international airport 
the two southern california quakes and more than a dozen quakes 
and aftershocks that rattled northern and southern california over 
the weekend occurred on different faults said caltech seismologist 
kate hutton while their timing was slightly odd she said it 
was only coincidental 
on sunday evening a quake centered 10 miles northeast of san 
jose in northern california and measuring 53 on the richter scale 
broke windows emptied supermarket shelves and knocked children off 
their feet 
that afternoon a 34 quake rolled through the ontario area 30 
miles inland from los angeles twentyfour minutes later a 33 
quake jolted napa and solano counties in northern california no 
damage or injuries were reported in either 
on friday a 52 quake hit the garlock fault near gorman 60 
miles north of downtown los angeles2 on the richter scale it was 
followed by two aftershocks measuring 40 and 34 that quake 
forced the temporary closure of the 440mile california aqueduct 
two civil warera buildings at the fort tejon state historic park 
also suffered quake damage 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area one measuring 4 can cause moderate damage 
and one at 5 can cause considerable damage quakes of higher 
magnitude can cause severe damage

two militant sikh separatists rushed out 
of the golden temple complex today attacked paramilitary troops 
with swords and wounded two before they were shot dead police said 
elsewhere in punjab state a gang of sikh extremists raided a 
village north of amritsar on monday night and shot nine people to 
death including eight hindus police said one of the victims was 
a 10yearold girl 
the attack at the golden temple occurred just outside the main 
entrance where police set up a post a month ago to search 
everybody entering the sikh religions holiest shrine 
the searches are intended to keep sikh extremists from sneaking 
weapons into the shrine sikh radicals have been fighting a 
guerrilla war since 1982 for a separate homeland in punjab 
the two sikh radicals apparently had escaped earlier police 
detection said ms sethi superintendent of the paramilitary 
central reserve police force 
they grabbed swords from shops near the temple gate and began 
slashing at paramilitary forces sethi said he said two of his men 
were wounded before the assailants were shot to death by other 
troops 
police and paramilitary forces besieged the golden temple may 
918 to drive out extremists who had turned the shrine into an 
armed camp at least 46 people were killed during the siege most 
of them militants more than 200 radicals and sympathizers 
surrendered 
the government has begun buying and demolishing buildings with 
30 yards of the golden temple complex to prevent extremists from 
using them as cover to sneak into the shrine 
the attack on the hindus monday night was in the village of 
chakpamani about 22 miles north of amritsar police said up to 10 
sikh extremists arrived at the village on foot and entered several 
hindu homes killing seven people 
the sikh servant of the villages hindu leader kishan chand 
tried to ward off the attackers but was killed police said 
chands 10yearold daughter was shot to death but chand escaped 
injury they said 
the killings in chakpamani raised to nearly 1290 the number of 
people killed by sikh extremists in punjab since the start of the 
year last year 1030 people died 
most of the victims have been hindus or moderate sikhs opposed 
to the separatist campaign 
sikhs whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam claim they are discriminated 
against by indias majority hindus 
sikhs make up less than 2 percent of indias 800 million people 
but are a majority in punjab

a california man doctors call the 
super spreader has infected at least four women with aids and 
is still having sexual encounters according to a report released 
today 
he has infected four out of five of his partners that we have 
seen but we dont know all of his partners said dr nancy 
padian of the university of california at berkeley 
in other research presented today dr william haseltine of the 
danafarber cancer institute in boston described the discovery of a 
gene in the aids virus that seems to slow the virus proliferation 
inside the body 
ms padian said the super spreader a hemophiliac infected 
through contaminated blood products is in his 20s lives in 
southern california and is still healthy with no signs of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
ms padian outlined the outbreak attributed to this man as part 
of a study of infection rates among women who engage in risky sex 
he is now using condoms she said we asked him to tell 
women about his aids infection but we cant guarantee he is 
doing that 
ms padian and haseltine dsecribed their findings at the fourth 
international conference on aids 
haseltine said the new gene dubbed vpu has been isolated by 
his and two other research labs 
the virus without this gene grows faster he said 
he said the gene is one of four in the complex aids avirus that 
regulate the speed with which it makes new copies of itself inside 
infected cells 
now we have two genes that speed the virus up and two that 
slow it down haseltine said 
researchers believe it may be possible to shut down the aids 
virus with drugs that could manipulate the microbes builtin 
control genes 
among research described at the meeting monday 
dr anthony adams of the us centers for disease control said 
that between 20 and 25 health care workers around the world have 
become infected with aids as a result of onthejob exposure to the 
virus 
we are now almost a decade since the transmission of the virus 
became reasonably common he said we are still looking at a 
very small number of people who get infected in the healthcare 
setting 
dr samuel broder of the us national cancer institute said 
that the experimental antiaids drug cd4 still looks very 
promising despite concerns that it may not protect against the 
spread of aids to the brain 
dr jay levy of the university of california at san francisco 
said it appears that some of the bodys own antibodies actually 
help the aids virus get into blood cells he said vaccine 
developers should be careful not to accidentally aid the virus by 
prompting the body to make antibodies that the microbe needs 
researchers from three countries presented six cases in which 
babies caught the aids virus while breast feeding they said the 
risk appears to be especially high if the mother becomes infected 
with the virus after she gives birth 
dr james goedert of the national cancer institute said the 
approximately 1 million americans already carrying the virus are 
growing more infectious so they are more likely to spread the 
disease to uninfected people 
dr timothy dondero reported the first results of the cdcs 
efforts to learn how many americans are infected with the aids 
virus by testing blood from hospital patients in testing in six 
hospitals three of every 1000 people were infected but the rate 
does not appear to be increasing 
dr bosenge ngaly of the zaire department of public health 
said the infection rate also seems to have stabilized in kinshasa 
the nations capital it has remained at about 7 percent among 
pregnant women since 1985 
dr hiroaki mitsuya of the national cancer institute said that 
dextran sulfate a drug used to lower cholesterol may block aids 
infection 
in the california study ms padian said the super spreader 
was somehow more infectious than most carriers of the virus 
perhaps because he was infected with a more contagious variety of 
the aids virus 
dr george seague iii of bostons department of health and 
hospitals said its very feasible that this phenomenon might 
occur some strains of the virus might be more readily spread 
ms padian said one of the infected women had sex with the man 
704 times one 300 times and one 15 times the fourth did not know 
how many contacts shed had 
she said her research on other women shows a tremendous 
variation in infectivity from person to person 
seven women studied got the virus after less than 100 sexual 
encounters with infected men while 19 others remained free of the 
virus after more than 1000 exposures

a norwegian unit of the un peacekeeping 
force was locked in a tense confrontation with israeli troops in 
southern lebanon today un sources said 
elsewhere in southern lebanon four lebanese villagers were 
killed and four others wounded when israeli gunners shelled shiite 
moslem guerrilla hideouts in tibnin valley before dawn police said 
un sources said norwegian and israeli troops faced each other 
through the night fingers on triggers as flares illuminated the 
skies over the foothills of mount hermon 
theyre still squared off in a tense confrontation one un 
source said at midmorning he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the source said the tension developed after norwegian 
peacekeepers blocked israeli troops two days ago from setting up a 
checkpoint close to a norwegian outpost on the southern edge of 
hebbariyeh 
the village is seven miles north of israels selfdesignated 
security zone in south lebanon it has a norwegian garrison of nine 
the source said a mechanized israeli unit rolled into hebbariyeh 
monday encircled the norwegian checkpoint and warned the 
peacekeepers that they will be treated as trespassers on israeli 
territory if they leave their post 
un spokesman timur goksel confirmed the confrontation and said 
20 israeli troops in two armored personnel carriers and a bulldozer 
were surrounding the norwegian position 
goksel said 50 other norwegian troops were dispatched to 
hebbariyeh to help the encircled position they removed barbedwire 
barricades set by the israelis around the checkpoint he said 
norway has an 881strong battalion in the un interim force in 
lebanon unifil comprises 5800 troops drawn from nine nations 
unifil deployed in south lebanon in 1978 to serve as a buffer 
between palestinian guerrillas and israels northern border its 
area overlaps with the security zone israel carved out in south 
lebanon in 1985 
unifil is against any israeli position to be set up in unifil 
area because it will cause a lot of tension goksel said 
he said contacts were under way to ease the hebbariyeh tension 
which he said was still running high this morning 
police said the tibnin valley shelling apparently was prompted 
by reports in the security zone of abnormal guerrilla activity in 
the area 
thirty mortar rounds crashed in and around tibnin overnight all 
eight casualties were civilians police said

mikhail s gorbachev and arms control negotiations between the two 
superpowers said a us official who briefed reporters on the 
visit 
shultz and de mita met for an hour but there were no details 
immediately available on their talk 
reagan and de mita were expected to discuss the agenda of the 
sevennation summit which brings together the heads of the worlds 
major industrialized countries for three days of talks beginning 
sunday in toronto canada 
the topics of discussion at the informal gettogether in toronto 
are still being worked out and the united states would like to hear 
italys views said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
de mita who took office in april at the head of italys 48th 
government since world war ii also was to meet with defense 
secretary frank c carlucci and house and senate leaders 
shultz and de mita had been expected to discuss italys 
agreement in principle to take in the 72 f16 fighter jets of the 
401st tactical fighter wing which spain is evicting from the 
torrejon air base near madrid 
italys lower house of parliament is scheduled to vote on the

international auspices to negotiate an agreement under which israel 
would give back all the lands it captured in the 1967 middle east 
war 
the united states favors a return of some lands to be worked out 
in direct arabisraeli talks without external interference 
de mita who heads the christian democratic party took office 
on april 13 after a monthlong political crisis caused by the 
resignation of his predecessor giovanni goria who served for only

americas largest presbyterian group urged 
israel to end its occupation of the west bank and the gaza strip 
calling its response to the palestinian uprising heavyhanded 
and today was considering its policy on us antinuclear dissent 
the 200th general assembly of the presbyterian church usa 
also was to select a top denominational officer in an election 
today taking precedence over other business facing the 630 
delegates 
the assembly on monday approved 49467 its statement calling on 
israel to end its occupation of the territories seized during the 
sixday war of 1967 
the statement from the 3 millionmember protestant denomination 
said israels heavyhanded crackdown during the 6monthold 
palestinian uprising portends what lies ahead unless a political 
settlement is reached 
it asked israel to cease the systemic violation of human 
rights of palestinians such as beatings and food and fuel 
embargoes 
the denomination urged israel to suspend settlement programs in 
the occupied territories since these simply provoke the arab 
peoples and reduce the opportunity for a peaceful resolution of the 
conflicting claims of israelis and palestinians 
it also 
called on palestinians and their leaders to try to control 
violence to ease the peace process 
asked the united states to discourage retaliation as a 
counterterror strategy in the middle east and to address the 
injustices which are among the root causes of terrorism 
the statement urged the united states to insist that weapons 
supplied for israels defense not be used against civilians in the 
occupied territories or in aggressive attacks or disproportionate 
retaliation upon other countries 
asked all parties to participate in a united nationssponsored 
international peace conference 
today the assembly was to begin discussing its statement on 
christian obedience in a nuclear age 
the statement which stemmed from a request five years ago by 
local presbyterian groups for guidance on how to respond to tax 
resisters was revised in lengthy meetings at the assembly by three 
committees 
the recommendations were edited to make it clear that while tax 
resistance and other acts of civil disobedience could be justified 
christians normally are expected to obey civil authorities 
the statement was edited in an effort to remove any doubt that 
disobedience is not a normal course a section was added saying 
military service could be an appropriate response to a christians 
conscience 
the committees reworded discussion of nuclear deterrence but 
left alone the declaration that nuclear war itself is immoral 
the original paper said nuclear deterrence assumes the 
willingness to use such weapons and is therefore immoral although 
it said unilateral disarmament is not yet feasible 
the final recommended statement said nuclear deterrence has 
been in danger of being regarded as an adequate and permanent means 
to national security rather an interim measure of selfdefense 
such a policy as an end in itself is not morally defensible 
the presbyterians also were to elect the stated clerk who is 
the officer responsible for overseeing the assemblys operation 
on saturday a committee said it would nominate harriet nelson 
a lay leader from california surprising many who expected the 
panel to nominate two people including the rev james e andrews 
andrews interim costated clerk or stated clerk since the 
denomination was formed in 1973 from the merger of the presbyterian 
church us and the presbyterian church usa has said he 
will be nominated from the floor

the foreign press association of israel on 
tuesday protested about 150 incidents of brutality against 
journalists by police and soldiers 
the 200member association issued the statement at a news 
conference and focused on an incident in which police beat up two 
foreign photograpers at a demonstration in tel aviv this month the 
beating was witnessed by other photographers 
we demand that the ministry of police investigate and punish 
those who took part in that incident said robert slater the 
chairman of the press association we deplore the statements by 
public officials that have created an odious public atmosphere 
all the incidents protested occurred in the past six months 
slater a correspondent for time magazine said government 
officials had made repeated statements indicating that the foreign 
press fanned the flames of the arab uprising which began dec 8 
he said such statements left in the minds of the public the 
idea that we have orchestrated events paid kids to throw stones 
and this has encouraged 19 and 20yearold soldiers to do 
their thing as they see fit 
in the june 4 tel aviv incident photographers sven nackstrand 
of agence france press and andre brutmann of alfa press were beaten 
by plainclothes and uniformed police while they photographed a 
demonstration against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
i was hit in all directions and struck to the ground i 
received five or six hard hits on the head and one felt like an 
explosion nackstrand told reporters 
nackstrand who has worked seven years in israel said he was 
then thrown near a police van and a few minutes later pulled into 
the van he was held in the van for about 10 minutes until a senior 
officer apparently realizing he was a journalist ordered him 
released 
slater said the police ministry didnt answer a cable sent a 
week ago protesting the incident 
police ministry spokeswoman mira firestein said her office 
received the cable and asked police in tel aviv to investigate and 
was still awaiting a reply

the consumer product safety commission warned 
tuesday that a halfmillion black amp decker weed trimmers that could 
pose an electrocution hazard remain in consumer hands despite an 
earlier recall 
the safety agency said it issued the new warning because of a 
lower than expected return rate for the trimmers 
involved are black amp decker model 82209 and model 82210 
bumpfeed string trimmers used on grass and weeds 
because of an error in wiring the electrical wires in some of 
the trimmers could be cut by the handle tube causing a potential 
for electrical shock the agency said four cases have been 
reported in which users were injured the commission said 
the trimmers were sold for 24 to 29 starting in 1985 owners 
should stop using the trimmers immediately and take them to a black 
amp decker service center for repair or replacement 
people needing more information can contact black amp decker at

sens alfonse damato rny and albert gore 
jr dtenn proposed legislation tuesday that would require the 
consumer product safety commission to ban the sale of threewheeled 
allterrrain vehicles and establishing a procedure for owners to 
obtain refunds 
consumers who bought atvs not knowing their inherent dangers 
deserve a refund damato said at a news conference the surest 
way to limit atvrelated deaths and injuries is to get these 
machines out of the hands of our children 
gore said the offroad sports vehicles have been linked to 
nearly 1000 deaths and more than 350000 injuries requiring 
medical treatment since 1982 
tragically children are often the victims of atv accidents 
he said in fact nearly onehalf of the injuries and deaths have 
been caused to children under the age of 16 
the legislation would require the cpsc to 
issue a rule within 60 days of the bills passage banning the 
sale of all threewheeled atvs 
issue a rule within 120 days under which refunds would be 
available to purchasers of threewheeled atvs or those who bought 
them for children under 16 
create a rule within 120 days requiring atv distributors to 
provide handson training to owners of the vehicles and members of 
their immediate families 
within a year establish performance standards and design 
characteristics to make atvs safer including age requirements for 
the safe operation of atvs 
of the 25 million atvs now in use about twothirds are 
threewheeled models the rest have four wheels 
the consumer product safety commission has not done an 
adequate job in protecting the consumer from the inherent risks and 
dangers associated with atvs damato said it is time for 
congress to force their hand in this matter 
commission chairman terrence m scanlon said in a statement that 
congress had the right to consider such legislation but he argued 
that a consent decree signed in april with the industry should be 
given adequate time to provide the necessary protection for atv 
users and their families 
the decree between the cpsc and five atv manufacturers banned 
the sale of threewheeled atvs unless the manufacturers can devise 
performance standards that are approved by the commission 
the decree also requires that warning labels be placed on 
fourwheeled models and that distributors provide training in the 
safe use of all types of atvs to people who purchased the vehicles 
after dec 30 1986 
also the decree requires manufacturers to spend 85 million to 
warn consumers about the hazards of atvs and to promote training 
cspc commissioner anne graham had voted against the consent 
decree because it lacked a recall provision carol dawson the 
third member of the commission voted for it but said consumers 
deserved the right to a reasonable refund if they so desired 
the damatogore bill requires the cpsc to establish the dollar 
amount of any refunds based on the age and condition of the atvs

montgomery county residents upset 
about a tax increase know where to gripe thanks to a sign posted 
in a county office listing the home telephone number of four 
taxraising supervisors 
treasurer ellis meredith posted the sign to ward off complaints 
i have had an enormous number of people who come into the 
office and they direct their complaints to me as if im the one 
who raises taxes meredith said 
ellis says the sign is just a source of information but the 
supervisors see it another way 
supervisor todd solberg blasted the sign as a misuse of a 
courthouse facility while supervisor ann hess called it terribly 
unprofessional 
ms hess said she received calls from people who objected to the 
sign but none from tax opponents 
earlier this year the supervisors voted 43 to approve a 167 
percent property tax increase in this southeastern virginia county 
meredith who had opposed the increase defended the sign 
if they vote to raise taxes then they ought to be man or 
woman enough to stand up outside the board meeting and say i was 
responsible for it meredith said

senators worked tuesday to craft a 
welfareoverhaul bill acceptable to the reagan administration but 
said they would move ahead with the landmark workoriented measure 
if no compromise could be reached 
were either going to wind it up or go out there on the 
floor and start battling it out said republican leader bob dole 
of kansas 
its not very clear what will satisfy the administration and 
that makes it very difficult said sen john chafee rri 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny author and chief sponsor 
of the fiveyear 26 billion family security act said 
closeddoor negotiations on his popular bill would go on all day 
and possibly into wednesday 
asked if the administration appeared to want a welfare bill he 
replied i think they dont want to veto a bill 
aides have said president reagan will do just that if senators 
do not agree to demands that include broader state flexibility to 
experiment with demonstration projects and a guaranteed rate of 
welfare recipient participation in broad new education training 
and employment programs 
moynihans bill would require states to institute new work and 
training programs and enroll as many welfare parents as they could 
afford with special emphasis on teenage mothers and others who 
are or are likely to be longterm recipients 
as part of its emphasis on parental responsibility the bill 
also requires extensive state efforts to determine paternity and 
automatic wage withholding immediately upon the awarding of child 
support 
moynihans bill has 64 sponsors in the 100member senate and an 
aide said two additional senators support it before going to the 
white house it would have to be reconciled with a similar but much 
more expensive house bill passed last december it is unclear 
whether either the senate or the house could muster the twothirds 
majority needed to override a presidential veto 
moynihan has been fighting mandatory participation rates on 
behalf of the nations governors who fear that with their limited 
resources they would have to provide cursory services to the least 
needy people in order to meet the required level 
sen bob packwood rore said senators were discussing a 
mandatory 10 percent or 15 percent participation rate rising 
eventually to 25 percent the administration wanted to go higher 
than that he said 
senators said monday that the administration was seeking a 
universal mandatory and expensive workfare program but the issue 
appeared to have evaporated by tuesday 
thats not even under discussion moynihan said 
there will not be a compulsory work requirement from the 
federal level packwood said the states will have a lot of 
options 
moynihan also said the administration was no longer fighting a 
new requirement that states make welfare benefits available to 
twoparent families at least six months in a year twentysix 
states already provide yearround coverage

the house energy and commerce committee 
approved a controversial product liability bill tuesday that 
consumer activists immediately denounced as a probusiness assault 
on the legal rights of victims of hazardous products 
the bipartisan compromise which is given virtually no chance of 
passing congress this year would establish uniform federal 
liability standards for lawsuits over defective consumer goods 
conflicting but generally stronger state laws would be preempted 
business lobbyists said a federal law would ease the growing 
burden of liability insurance costs and result in lower consumer 
prices consumer groups said the bill would make it harder for 
victims to recover damages from manufacturers of unsafe products 
the bill described by rep james florio dnj as complex 
and politically charged was approved 3012 with the unanimous 
support of the committees 17 republicans and a bare 13member 
majority of its 25 democrats 
it was the first time a product liability bill had ever cleared 
a house committee a similar measure died on the senate floor in 
late 1986 after a filibuster led by ernest b hollings dsc an 
adamant foe of such legislation 
the house measure now heads for further study by an unfriendly 
judiciary committee which shares jurisdiction and traditionally 
has favored trial lawyers in their opposition to such bills 
we are getting ready for a fight in judiciary said rep 
mike synar dokla who had won the energy and commerce panels 
approval of several proconsumer amendments during more than a 
month of wrangling over the bill 
consumer lobbyists lost no time castigating the bill and its 
supporters 
since 1981 american industry has been battering away at 
congress trying to get a preemptive federal product liability law 
passed that would give manufacturers and sellers greater 
opportunity to place dangerous products on the market with 
diminished liability to the people they injure said joan 
claybrook president of public citizen 
today a majority of the committee brought that consumer 
nightmare a little closer to reality she said 
consumer advocate ralph nader said the committee had sided with 
toxic chemical producers dangerously defective product 
manufacturers and other promoters of corporate violence 
alexander b trowbridge president of the national association 
of manufacturers said the bill provides a fair and responsible 
overhaul of product liability laws he said it would help curb 
the number of unwarranted lawsuits stimulate the economy and 
reduce consumer prices 
everyone except the nations trial lawyers wins under this 
bill trowbridge said 
a major feature protested by consumer advocates is the state 
of the art defense made available to manufacturers under the bill 
that provision says manufacturers can escape liability for 
damages if they can prove they did not know or could not know 
of a design defect with knowledge reasonably available to 
experts or if there was no feasible alternative design 
synar won approval of an amendment putting the burden of proof 
on the manufacturer rather than the consumer the committee also 
accepted a proconsumer escape hatch sponsored by synar that 
would require plaintiffs to prove only that the product was so 
unsafe compared with its usefulness that it should not have been 
marketed 
another synar provision would ease the standard of proof that 
plaintiffs must meet in suing manufacturers but consumer interests 
are unhappy over his proposal to give a judge rather than a trial 
jury the responsibility for deciding whether a product should have 
been barred from the market because of safety hazards 
critics say the bills provision for a stateoftheart defense 
currently available to manufacturers in only eight states would 
undermine the legal doctrine of strict liability used in 47 
states and favored by consumer interests 
that doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the 
manufacturers alleged misconduct to the defective product itself 
relieving the courts of establishing what a manufacturer knew or 
should have known about a products defects

former presidential candidates george mcgovern 
and barry goldwater usually on opposite ends of the political 
spectrum joined tuesday in urging israel to recognize the 
national legitimacy of arab palestinians and turn over 
territory to them in exchange for peace 
their proposal differs from the plan unsuccessfully pursued by 
secretary of state george p shultz in that it would bypass jordan 
which controlled the west bank for l9 years and strongly implies 
but does not specifically recommend creation of a palestinian 
state 
mcgovern the losing democratic standard bearer in 1972 was 
explicit in an interview however that israel should deal with the 
palestine liberation organization with the purpose of establishing 
a palestinian state on the west bank 
beside mcgovern and goldwater who was the losing republican 
presidential candidate in 1964 those endorsing the proposal were 
former undersecretary of state george w ball former world jewish 
congress president philip w klutznick and three former european 
government heads garrett fitzgerald of ireland anker jorgensen 
of denmark and bruno kreisky of austria 
we support the continued independence and security of the 
state of israel the statement said we equally affirm the 
right of selfdetermination and security for the palestinian 
people we believe that mutual recognition and goodfaith 
negotiations between israelis and palestinians can achieve a just 
settlement 
israel would yield all of the west bank and the gaza strip 
which it has held since 1967 to form a homeland for the 
palestinians in return for the arab worlds acceptance 
the negotiations the statement said should be based on 
mutual recognition of national legitimacy and the exchange of 
territory for peace the bloody violence and loss of life in the 
disputed territory underscores the urgency of constructive 
negotiations 
shultz returned last week from the middle east where he was 
unable to persuade israel and jordan to enter negotiations 
jordans king hussein demanded assurances that israel would yield 
the west bank which israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir refused 
to provide 
in ruling out plo participation shultz said yasser arafats 
organization which has carried out a number of terrorist assaults 
on israelis and americans must recognize israels right to exist 
first his plan called for including palestinians in a joint 
delegation with jordan 
asked about bypassing jordan mcgovern said i think weve got 
to get around it the government of israel has to negotiate with 
the plo the plo has said its willing to be part of an allarab 
delegation that would be fine with me its a matter of the 
palestinians determining who is to speak for them 
mcgovern said the plo was the only organization capable of 
speaking for arab palestinians and the only one that could 
enforce whats agreed on

one of the last members of the shakers 
a 200yearold denomination devoted to peace and communal living 
was remembered tuesday as a woman whose grace kindness and wit 
touched hundreds of people 
here was someone who was very happy with her life and who 
shared that with everybody said dan eastman she was the most 
kind and generous person i ever knew 
eldress gertude soule died saturday in her sleep at age 93 
leaving just two elderly shaker women at this hilltop community 
that once was home to 400 the religion that once numbered 6000 
members has dwindled to fewer than a dozen 
i think shell always be here in her spiritual presence and in 
memory said darryl thompson whose father is the historical 
director of the canterbury shaker village and whose first baby 
clothes were made by eldress soule the challenge for us will be 
to keep that living sense of presence alive and pass on the 
heritage 
because they were celibate shakers maintained their numbers 
through converts and orphans like eldress soule who went to the 
shaker community at sabbathday lake maine at age 11 after her 
mother died at 21 she decided to stay on and took her vows 
about 150 people packed the tiny dwelling house chapel and more 
than 50 stood outside for the 90minute funeral in temperatures 
that approached 90 degrees in cloudless sunshine 
eldress bertha lindsay 90 and sister ethel hudson 92 who 
live at the village wore traditional shaker dress and sat side by 
side standing to sing shaker hymns during the service other 
shakers from sabbathday lake the only other surviving shaker 
community also attended 
eldress soule was buried at a cemetery enclosed by stone and 
iron fences where a single granite stone is marked shakers 
village residents names were listed in books and records but they 
share the common gravestone in death as they shared all their 
possessions in life 
those who wished to give testimony about eldress soule 
described her as a woman who loved children nature and her life in 
the village of white clapboard buildings atop a hill surrounded by 
fields 
the day she died i went to all the places we used to spend 
time and she was there in every place darryl thompson said 
she saw god in every flower 
jim hansen of new boston described how he came to know eldress 
soule three years ago after visiting for a traditional shaker 
dinner offered when the village is open as a museum to visitors 
believe it or not eldress soule last fall said she always 
wanted to learn how to shoot a gun hansen said he said he got a 
22caliber rifle and she got a tin can donned her bonnet and cape 
and they went behind her house she wanted to put the can on a 
100yearold shaker fence hansen said 
i said no you might shoot the fence he said she said 
im not going to shoot the fence im going to shoot the can 
id like to report the shakers are excellent marksmen she hit 
two out of four shots dead center hansen said im going to 
miss her 
richard morse the shakers lawyer also remembered eldress 
soules sense of humor and her courage 
here was a lady who stood fast for what she believed in and 
always did it with the most pleasant way about her morse said 
the shakers lived simply farming and producing tools such as 
the clothespin and flat broom they were pacifists and believed all 
people were equal 
originating in the 1770s in england the shaking quakers grew 
under the leadership of mother ann lee who moved to new york 
in 1774 with eight followers formally named the united society of 
the believers in christs second coming they gained their nickname 
from emotional trembling in their religious services

the government is moving quickly to lower taxes 
for cooperative ventures before a new law enters force july 1 the 
official soviet news agency tass said tuesday 
the new measure broadens the rights of the thousands of 
independent enterprises that are key to kremlin leader mikhail 
gorbachevs reform movement 
the announcement was a victory for those supporting gorbachevs 
efforts to reform the soviet economy and to provide a better 
quality and selection of consumer goods and services 
last month the supreme soviet the nominal national parliament 
passed a law ensuring that cooperatives owned by their members 
rather than the state can compete on an equal footing with 
staterun businesses 
it allows cooperatives to earn hard currency prohibits 
government interference in their business and bars the state from 
taking them over 
but it would have left in place a new tax ladder set up by the 
finance ministry forcing cooperatives to pay the state up to 90 
percent of profits 
supreme soviet deputies called for a change complaining that 
the taxes would strangle the cooperatives 
a leading reform advocate economist nikolai shmelev had told a 
news conference rewriting the tax law might take as long as a year 
but tass said government experts will have the new tax law ready 
in weeks 
significant changes are expected to be made to the decree 
tass said they say in particular that progressive taxes on 
coops will be reduced to 60 percent and even possibly 50 percent 
from the current 90 
members of the coops most needed by society for example 
building ones as well as cooperatives selling their products at 
state prices will most likely be exempted from progressive 
taxation altogether

democrats are planning to use computers to 
tally some of the votes at the partys nominating convention next 
month but officials say the hightech addition wont upstage the 
traditional high point of the convention the statebystate roll 
call 
the partys convention committee is working out the bugs in an 
electronic voting system that will allow delegations using small 
computers on the floor to vote on the party platform and 
convention rules votes would be displayed on a big overhead screen 
behind the podium 
but we will still do the roll call for the president and vice 
president in the traditional manner said ruth berry a 
spokeswoman for the committee that is planning the july 1821 
convention in atlanta 
the statebystate roll call in which the head of each 
delegation takes the floor to announce the states votes is a 
longstanding tradition she said its something people expect 
and it adds excitement to the convention 
several other hightech features are being explored by the 
convention committee incuding the electronics to allow delegates 
to send messages to other delegates on the floor computer to 
computer she said 
the committee also is talking to southern bell which provides 
local phone service in atlanta about televising convention 
activities on closedcircuit highdefinition television monitors 
around the convention center and in nearby vip and hospitality 
suites 
highdefinition tv still in the experimental stage is 
considered the next generation in television delivering clearer 
brighter images on a screen that is wider than conventional tv sets 
and with the sound quality of a compactdisc recording 
southern bell has found eight largescreen japanesemade 
monitors it can use at the convention but is having trouble finding 
more said bill mccloskey a spokesman for bellsouth the parent 
corporation of southern bell few monitors are available because 
the japanese leaders in hdtv development plan to cover the seoul 
olympics in high definition for a countrywide demonstration in 
japan this summer he said 
southern bell has put in a 1063mile fiber optic network to 
handle about 9000 convention telephone lines that will be used by 
an estimated 16000 reporters editors and technicians and 14000 
delegates party representatives and other convention participants

the judge who sentenced the 
sharpeville six to hang said monday he would not reopen their 
murder trial but he gave the convicts 35 days to appeal for 
clemency from president pw botha 
botha already has turned down such a request despite 
international appeals that he spare the lives of the five black men 
and one woman convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black town 
councilor 
the campaign appeared to be resuming monday neil kinnock 
leader of britains opposition labor party asked south africas 
white authorities to stop the execution in the name of common 
humanity and for the sake of preventing violence 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
we continue to appeal for a humanitarian resolution of the 
sharpeville six case whether it be clemency or the granting of a 
new trial we will be making our views known to the south african 
government through diplomatic channels 
judge willem human of the pretoria supreme court who presided 
at the original trial in 1985 rejected an application by defense 
lawyers that the case be reopened to consider allegations that 
police coerced two state witnesses 
human said he had seen no affidavits from the witnesses saying 
their testimony was false and said that even if they lied there 
was enough evidence for convictions 
the councilor in the sharpeville black township was stoned to 
death and burned during riots provoked by a rent increase 
none of the six was proved guilty of physical involvement in the 
death of khuzwayo dlamini but they were found guilty under the 
principle that they participated actively in the crowd that 
murdered him 
the defendants are mojalefa sefatsa reid mokoena oupa diniso 
duma khumalo francis mokhesi and theresa ramashamola the only 
woman on death row for what oppenents of the government call a 
politically related crime 
their execution originally was scheduled for march 17 and botha 
resisted appeals for clemency from churches human rights groups 
and governments including the united states britain and japan 
judge human granted a stay hours before the six were to hang 
agreeing to hear arguments that the trial should be reopened 
because of the possibility that police coerced two prosecution 
witnesses to give false testimony 
defense lawyers told human in court monday they did not have 
affidavits from the witnesses human called their request for a new 
trial frivolous and absurd 
he refused them permission to appeal and said they should have 
taken their request to botha he stayed the executions for 35 more 
days so the lawyers could take whatever further steps are possible 
the lawyers said they would would petition pj rabie acting 
chief justice for permission to take humans decision to the 
appeals court he heads that court like the president already has 
refused to overturn humans original decision and sentence 
several dozen friends relatives and diplomats were in the 
courtroom monday thewy did not react immediately to the reading of 
the decision but some family members wept later when lawyer 
prakesh diar explained it to them in the corridor relatives then 
went to pretoria prison to visit the six convicts 
diar agreed with a reporter that although he will appeal to the 
chief justice the fate of the sharpeville six is in bothas hands 
im afraid to say yes that is so he said i hope and i 
pray that the state president will reconsider his previous 
decision this is a politically related case bothas decision 
may be based on political considerations 
he said he spoke with his clients last week and described them 
as hopeful but not confident 
referring to the international campaign to save them he said 
although they are in their cells alone they are not alone 
spiritually they know the world is with them 
the government has contended the six have been unfairly 
portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law 
authorities say evidence at the trial proved each played an 
active part in the killing through such actions as making firebombs 
to burn dlaminis house and slapping a woman who pleaded for the 
councilors life

the first law in the nation to regulate 
use of computer terminals in the workplace was enacted tuesday when 
the suffolk county legislature overrode the county executives veto 
it is a happy day for suffolk countys workforce said 
legislator john foley who introduced the bill 
in six months businesses with more than 20 visual display 
terminals will have to provide special treatment for workers who 
spend more than 26 hours a week in front of the computer screens 
the workers must have 15minute breaks or a new work assignment 
after three hours with a vdt 
the employer must pay 80 percent of the cost of annual eye 
exams and any eyeglasses that are needed 
in addition any equipment purchased after next year must have 
such features as nonglare screens adjustable desks and 
fivelegged chairs 
the bill was written in response to worker complaints of 
eyestrain muscle aches and other ill effects from longterm vdt 
use 
subsequently california researchers reported that a study found 
that women who used vdts for more than 20 hours a week during the 
first three months of preganncy suffered twice the number of 
miscarriages of women who rarely used terminals but the 
researchers said they could not determine whether the vdts or some 
other factor such as job stress caused the increased rate 
county executive patrick halpin vetoed the suffolk measure on 
friday saying it would drive businesses away from the eastern long 
island county 
the new law will cost suffolk many good high tech jobs he 
predicted after tuesdays vote 
the 18member legislature discussed the bill for about an hour 
before voting 135 one vote more than needed to override 
halpins veto 
the county executive heard what he wanted to hear from big 
money big business and fear said legislator rose caracappa 
opposition to this bill was based on overreaction charged 
legislator gregory blass weve heard the doom and gloom from 
business in the past when bottledeposit and antismoking bills 
were enacted 
halpin said he would try to implement the law so it will have 
minimal impact on the business community 
the county health department is responsible for enforcing the 
new law 
james larocca president of the long island association a 
business group predicted the loss of more than 3000 jobs in 
pending expansion and relocation deals 
supporters of the bill were the communications workers of 
america civil service employees association and various womens 
groups

what do presidential scholars know apparently 
a good bit more than the typical 17yearold 
but a good many still were stumped by some questions on a 
federal education officials quiz on us history and literature 
chester finn jr the assistant secretary of education for 
research and improvement said tuesday that the presidential 
scholars who took the multiplechoice test answered an average of 
86 percent of the questions correctly 
that compared with a 48 percent score for 8000 juniors who 
answered the same questions in 1986 as part of a national 
assessment of educational progress test 
finn who coauthored a book about the results called what do 
our 17yearolds know said it was a respectable showing 
but many of the presidential scholars some of the nations top 
high school seniors being honored here this week in four days of 
ceremonies and seminars missed some questions that finn clearly 
thought they should have known 
only 63 percent of the scholars picked speak softly and carry 
a big stick as the phrase that characterized us foreign policy 
during the early 1900s only 32 percent of the 17yearolds tested 
in 1986 got that right the phrase is a quotation from president 
theodore roosevelt 
only 48 percent picked eudora welty and flannery oconnor as 
authors known for stories set in the south the national average 
was 14 percent 
fifty percent correctly picked jane addams as the founder of 
settlement houses to help the urban poor the national average was 
41 percent 
fiftyone percent identified richard wright as the author of 
native son a novel of black life in chicago the national 
average was 32 percent 
finn said a hundred and one of you had the courage to 
actually take this test this of course skews the results since the 
20 or so of you who ducked it undoubtedly would have done worse on 
it you were not a representative sample even of yourselves 
at a session hosted by the education department for the 
scholars he called the 86 percent score pretty good but not 
cause for any swelled heads 
finn outlined reagan administration critiques of american 
schools and why it favors merit pay for teachers and other policies 
to spur improvements 
when john kandara of winstonsalem nc asked about the 
anxiety that teacher career ladder plans can cause finn replied 
in most professions competition is not considered a vice are 
you familiar with the olympics indeed are you familiar with 
presidential scholars 
american kids in general just dont go to school enough 
said finn who said a teen magazine generated a flood of letters 
criticizing him for a recent article in which he advocated 
yearround schools 
the most interesting about the letters was how many were 
utterly incoherent said finn 
scott murphy a scholar from columbia mo asked how american 
universities achieve world eminence with students who are so far 
inferior 
finn replied that the best american research universities are 
second to none but an awful lot of colleges are driven by the 
dynamics of keeping their classes full

three years after the fact the soviet unions 
highestranking military official has apologized for the 1985 
shooting death of an american army officer inside east germany the 
pentagon said tuesday 
the apology was extended by soviet defense minister dmitri yazov 
to defense secretary frank c carlucci at a private meeting may 31 
during the moscow summit said dan howard the pentagons chief 
spokesman 
yazov offered no new details or explanation for the march 24 
1985 shooting of maj arthur d nicholson jr by a soviet soldier 
nor did he respond to previous us demands for financial 
compensation to nicholsons family howard said 
nonetheless we feel we have received the appropriate apology 
from the soviets yes the spokesman said the request for or 
the demand for an apology we feel has been responded to 
appropriately by the minister 
howard quoted yazov as saying i express my regret over the 
incident and am sorry this occurred this does not promote improved 
relations secretary carlucci and i have agreed we will do all we 
can to prevent these kinds of incidents in the future 
howard also said the two men had agreed during their moscow 
talks on the need to come up with some sort of regime that will 
prevent these things from happening 
the two sides agreed to come up with a list of recent such 
incidents violations whatever and to meet again to try to work 
out a set of ground rules howard said thats where it stands 
at the moment 
the pentagon spokesman repeatedly described yazovs apology as 
appropriate or satisfactory apparently trying to close out an 
affair that had been seized upon by carluccis predecessor as a 
stark example of soviet inhumanity 
former defense secretary caspar w weinberger much to the 
occasional chagrin of state department officials never stopped 
demanding an apology and compensation for nicholsons death even as 
overall eastwest relations improved 
weinberger stepped down last november 
howard disclosed the yazov apology during a regular pentagon 
briefing the first to be held since carlucci returned from an 
aroundtheworld trip that included stops in moscow japan and 
south korea 
the spokesman said he did not disclose the apology at the close 
of the summit meeting between president reagan and mikhail s 
gorbachev because no reporters asked about the matter 
brig gen roland lajoie who was nicholsons commanding officer 
at the time of his death hailed yazovs apology as longawaited 
vindication 
it was a long time coming but the soviet military has made 
the right decision lajoie said in a statement tuesday 
their apology vindicates the position that the us government 
has constantly maintained on this tragic incident i am personally 
very pleased to hear the news but more importantly the nicholson 
family will be gratified at this development 
lajoie was a colonel at the time of nicholsons death he is now 
a onestar general in charge of the new onsite inspection agency 
that will oversee verification of the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty 
nicholson was shot and killed by a soviet army sentry more than 
three years ago while on what was supposed to be a routine 
surveillance mission inside east germany 
the 37yearold nicholson of west redding conn was a member 
of the us military liaison mission allowed under the terms of a 
1947 treaty to keep tabs on soviet military activities inside east 
germany 
on the day he died nicholson and a driver sgt jessie g 
schatz were trying to observe a soviet tank shed according to the 
us account nicholson was close to but not in a restricted 
area when a soviet sentry suddenly opened fire without warning 
the pentagon has charged that schatz was directly prevented from 
going to the wounded man with his first aid kit and that the major 
was left to die without medical attention the defense department 
also noted angrily at the time that soviet military inspectors 
working inside west germany had never been threatened with being 
shot 
the russians previously had countered that nicholson was 
improperly wearing a camouflaged uniform had strayed into a 
restricted area and ignored several shouted warnings before the 
sentry opened fire

secretary of state george p shultz lashed out 
at nicaraguan authorities on tuesday accusing them of reneging on 
promises to create democracy and of subjecting contra negotiators 
to harassment and intimidation during talks last week 
but shultz after a meeting with the contra leadership declined 
to say whether the failure of the peace negotiations between the 
leftist sandinista government and the contras means the 
administration will seek military aid for the rebels 
meanwhile nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann held the 
contras responsible for collapse of the peace talks contending 
they had made demands so outlandish and unacceptable that they 
knew in advance the sandinista negotiators would reject them 
in a letter to house speaker jim wright dtexas tunnermann 
said that on the last day of the talks the contras introduced an 
entirely new set of demands and insisted that the government 
accept all of them within two hours 
they virtually presented my government with an ultimatum 
tunnermann said 
shultz speaking with reporters said that in managua last week 
the resistance delegation was harassed initimidated and 
subjected to continual abuse treated virtually as prisoners 
refused permission to meet with democratic political leaders and 
threatened with harm by defense minister humberto ortega if they 
refused to sign an agreement 
alfredo cesar a member of the contra directorate asked to 
elaborate on shultzs allegation said ortega at one point 
threatened to deny the rebel delegation permission to leave managua 
if the talks broke down 
about 20 minutes later he ortega said that once the war 
started again the bullets from the sandinistas will not only be 
against our combatants from the mountains but against the people 
sitting across this table cesar said 
shultz blaming the sandinistas for the breakdown of the talks 
said their actions have shown the world that their promises of 
democratization have no counterpart in concrete action 
their consistent and apparent goal has been to disarm and 
eliminate the resistance so that they can proceed to consolidate 
their rule in nicaragua sultz said 
their kind of rule in nicaragua will never be accepted as 
legitimate by the united states we will stick with the resistance 
freedom fighters their cause of peace with freedom is the right 
cause 
it was not clear what shultz meant when he raised questions 
about the legitimacy of the sandinista government because the 
united states has always been represented in managua by an 
ambassador since the start of the 1979 revolution 
shultz met with cesar and two other members of the contra 
directorate on tuesday along with the rebels military commander 
col enrique bermudez as part of an assessment of future options 
the contra leaders met into the dinner hour at the white house 
with national security adviser colin powell there was no immediate 
indication of what transpired in that meeting 
rep jack kemp rny has recommended a 105 million package 
of military and humanitarian aid for the contras and contra leader 
adolfo calero has indicated support for that proposal 
the contras have received no military aid since feb 29 but 
congress has approved assistance for the purchase of food shelter 
medical supplies and clothing the administrations last request 
for military aid was rejected by the house on feb 3 
the rebels will confer wednesday with members of congress about 
possible future steps 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois said contra aid 
was discussed at a meeting of gop congressional leaders with 
president reagan on tuesday but no decisions were reached 
michel said he expects a push for renewal of humanitarian aid 
asked about the prospect of military aid he said i dont think 
quite frankly there has been the kind of dramatic movement either 
way that would indicate we would change any votes in congress

an arabamerican deported from israeli said 
tuesday that he would consider converting to judaism if necessary 
to return to israel 
mubarak awad an advocate of nonviolent palestinian resistance 
was deported monday by the israeli government which accused him of 
subversion 
awad a us citizen who was born in jerusalem and returned 
there in 1983 said he might convert from christianity to judaism 
and seek reentry under israels law of the return if everything 
else failed 
its going to take a lot of guts to do it awad said at a 
news conference maybe i have to do it 
i am here but not by choice he said i was deported just 
because i am a christian if i were a jew i would not be 
deported 
under the law of the return any jew can enter israel but the 
privilege is not absolute gangster meyer lansky for example 
sought israeli citizenship under the law in 1970 but was forced to 
leave in 1972 following allegations of his continued involvement in 
organized crime 
pressed on the subject of conversion awad said ill tell a 
rabbi frankly its not my belief its a political statement 
that im persecuted because im a christian 
leaders of reform judaism meanwhile issued a letter saying 
that extraneous motivations political motivations are not 
sufficient reason for conversion 
no one can rule out the possibility of a sincere conversion in 
anybodys case but this must be proved at the end of a long period 
of instruction said a letter sent to 1500 reform rabbis in the 
united states and canada 
but awad said he would first pursue other avenues to return to 
israel including appealing to international public opinion he 
said he planned meetings with officials at the united nations in 
washington europe and the soviet union 
in ordering awad deported israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
alleged that he played a key role in this years arab uprising in 
the occupied territories 
but awad disclaimed any overriding influence among palestinians 
saying shamir hes the one who made me a hero 
he defended his support of the palestine liberation 
organization but said he did not support all the organizations 
actions or policies i condemn violence from the plo from 
israelis from everybody he said 
awad denied inciting violence against israel but has supported 
the uprising in the territories israel captured in the 1967 middle 
east war some tactics he has long advocated such as tax boycotts 
and commercial strikes were adopted by leaders of the uprising 
awad is the 21st arab to be expelled by israel since the dec 8 
start of the palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip his expulsion was protested by the reagan 
administration 
awad was deported on the grounds that his threemonth tourist 
visa issued last august had expired the israelis refused to extend 
the visa and the israeli supreme court last week rejected awads 
appeal to stay 
awad who lived in the united states for 13 years before 
returning to jerusalem in 1983 is the founder of the palestinian 
center for the study of nonviolence in that city he has lectured 
on civil disobedience counseled teachers against corporal 
punishment and planted olive trees in west bank villages to 
underscore the arabs claim to the land 
he lived in wapakoneta ohio where he still owns a home his 
wife nancy nye said she soon will be going to jerusalem to teach

the army ordered west bank schools closed for 
two days trying to head off student protests during a general 
strike called for wednesday by underground leaders of the 
6monthold palestinian rebellion 
schools in the west bank were closed for four months and 
students held violent demonstrations after high schools reopened 
this week the twoday closing wednesday and thursday was intended 
as a warning to students that they may be shut again if violence 
continues 
new army figures said dozens of israeli soldiers have been 
convicted of or charged with excessive use of force and other 
violations of regulations since the uprising began dec 8 in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the figures also showed the number of arabs detained without 
charges which permits them to be held for up to six months 
increasing by onefifth since may to 2500 most are young 
activists 
civil rights workers criticized defense minister yitzhak rabins 
statement to the cabinet this week that israeli civilians who see 
arabs holding firebombs would be allowed to shoot them 
this is giving the green light for shooting and killing 
without justification lawyer amnon zichroni said this will 
lead to counterattacks from palestinians its a vicious cycle 
without end 
at least 207 palestinieguards our freedoms and underpins the development 
of 
the west 
the prospects for a lasting peace require us to prevent any 
weakening of our atlantic solidarity to refrain from any actions 
of unilateral disarmament he said 
de mita said later at a news conference that a disagreement over 
middle east policy was aired during his talks with administration 
officials 
secretary of state george p shultz is trying to arrange 
negotiations between israel and a delegation of jordanians and 
palestinians he has ruled out participation by the palestine 
liberation organization unless it accepts israels right to exist 
as well as creation of a palestinian state 
de mita said he told the americans that italy continues to 
believe the plo is the legitimate representative of the palestinian 
people 
one of the topics expected to arise at the toronto summit is the 
extent to which the industrialized democracies should help eastern 
european nations solve their economic problems 
de mita said he and the president agreed that massive aid for 
these countries should be withheld as long as their economies are 
predominantly statemanaged 
de mita planned to meet on wednesday with members of congress 
and defense secretary frank c carlucci before making a private 
visit to bar harbor maine

a monk from rome brought petitions here 
tuesday from nearly 2 million italians seeking commutation of the 
death penalty given to a teenager for the murder and robbery of a 
bible teacher 
the rev vito bracone said he was disappointed that gov robert 
d orr who had previous engagements did not accept the petitions 
in person instead bracone met with an aide to the governor and 
with the convicted murderer paula r cooper 18 
the petition drive in italy began in november 1986 to win 
clemency for cooper of gary who was sentenced to die in indianas 
electric chair for a 1985 robbery and stabbing 
pope john paul ii announced last september that he too would 
like to see cooper granted clemency 
orr leaving his office to fulfill two speaking engagements 
said bracone and the amnesty international members accompanying the 
franciscan monk hadnt called to ask for a meeting 
if they had orr said hes not sure he would have met with 
bracone because coopers appeal is pending 
the issue is still before the judiciary he said until 
theyve completed their work i think it would be inappropriate for 
me to get involved 
the governor has the authority to commute a sentence at any 
time but orr has not yet received a direct commutation request 
from coopers lawyers who still have an appeal pending before the 
state supreme court 
bracone at a news conference outside the statehouse said he 
only wanted a dialogue with the governor 
i dont see why we cannot talk i dont want to put any 
pressure on him said bracone 
michael k sutherlin a local amnesty international spokesman 
said the group might try later to arrange to present the petitions 
to orr 
he also pledged that the organization would try during the 1989 
general assembly to have the death penalty repealed amnesty 
international believes the death penalty is a human rights 
violation 
orr said he believes the death penalty still has broad public 
support in indiana 
during the 1987 legislative session amnesty international and 
other groups including the indiana catholic conference lobbied 
successfully for a bill to raise to 16 from 10 the minimum age of a 
person who could be sentenced to death 
the new law does not affect cooper who was 15 at the time of 
the 1985 stabbing and robbery of ruth e pelke 78 of gary three 
other teenagers were also convicted of related crimes in the 
slaying but none of the others was sentenced to die 
mrs pelkes grandson william pelke of portage has called for 
cooper to be granted clemency he accompanied bracone to the 
statehouse tuesday 
bracone and the rev justin belitz a franciscan priest from 
indianapolis met with cooper at the indiana womens prison in 
indianapolis she told them she is taking collegelevel 
correspondence courses from a bible college in fort wayne and soon 
will take courses from indiana university 
cooper said she would like eventually to study psychology and 
work with children

thousands of people joined a march in the latvian 
capital of riga tuesday in memory of latvians deported from the 
republic when it was occupied by soviet forces before and after 
world war ii tass reported 
the official soviet news agency said the march was sanctioned by 
soviet officials and many thousands of people participated 
it reported latvian historian jan riekstins addressed a rally 
and quoted him as saying we justifiably condemn the policy of 
cruelty 
last year a similar demonstration was allowed by soviet 
authorities without interference and latvian activists said 5000 
people took part 
the fact that this years march was officially sanctioned 
appeared linked to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
more open reporting of the wrongs conducted under the dictatorship 
of josef stalin who died in 1953 
latvian activists had said tuesdays demonstration was called 
to prevent the return of stalinist and neostalinist crimes 
against the people and in the further unwavering forward course of 
m gorbachevs restructuring according to ojars kalnins of the 
world federation of free latvians in washington 
tass quoted riga mayor alfred rudiks as saying the government of 
the republic had approved the initiative of young people to build 
in riga a monument to victims of stalins personality cult 
official soviet historians say 31000 people were deported from 
lativa after it was occupied by the soviet army in 1940 and in 
1949 the last occupation came after germany had been defeated and 
the soviets were in the process of annexing latvia and the 
neighboring baltic republics of lithuania and estonia germany had 
seized the republics during the war 
tass said many of the deportation victims were nazi sympathizers 
apart from those who were deservedly punished for acts of 
political sabotage collaboration with fascists banditism and 
espionage the deportees also included innocent people the 
agency said 
it had harsh words for one of the march organizers edmund 
cirvilis calling him a former nazi soldier who was sent to 
latvia on a terrorist mission in 1945 
repeated attempts to reach latvian activists in riga by 
telephone were unsuccessful 
there was no word on a demonstration planned tuesday in 
lithuania various reports say 36000 lithuanians were deported in 
1941 and 200000 in 1948 
last month soviet police broke up a demonstration by 5000 
lithuanians marking the anniversary of the 1949 deportations 
according to lithuanian activists 
the united states has never officially recognized the soviet 
claim to the baltic republics

a senior labor party official resigned tuesday in 
a dispute over whether the party should modify its controversial 
pledge to abandon britains nuclear weapons and shut down us 
nuclear bases 
legislator denzil davies the partys parliamentary spokesman on 
defense said the last straw was a recent statement by party 
leader neil kinnock that labors unilateral nuclear disarmament 
policy is outmoded 
i am fed up with being humiliated by mr kinnock said 
davies 49 
he never consults me on anything i cannot get up in the 
house of commons and make a speech when mr kinnock says all sorts 
of things all over the place one thing one day and another the 
next and he is supposed to be the future prime minister 
kinnock said he was amazed and sad that davies a fellow 
welshman and longtime senior figure in the opposition party had 
quit kinnock later named martin oneill a legislator since 1970 
to replace davies 
davies resignation announced in statement highlighted a 
widening split as kinnock pushes labor back toward the center in 
what he sees as the socialists only hope of ousting conservative 
prime minister margaret thatcher at the next election it must be 
held by 1992 
kinnock 46 a lifelong antinuclear campaigner angered labor 
leftwingers when he said in a june 5 television interview there 
was no need now for somethingfornothing unilateralism because 
the superpowers had broken the impasse by singing an accord 
scrapping intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
we would be complete fools whatever our politics to ignore 
the scope and scale of the change and the opportunities and 
responsibilities that go with trying to be part of that change 
kinnock said of ussoviet agreements 
tony benn an excabinet minister and leading leftist who will 
challenge kinnock for the leadership at the party conference in the 
fall said davies resignation confirmed there is unhappiness 
across the whole party about the way things are going 
the conservatives were jubilant at the renewed public outbreak 
of fighting among the laborites over the antinuclear policy which 
polls show is a major voteloser the job of defense spokesman in 
todays labor party is an impossible one commented mrs 
thatchers armed forces minister ian stewart 
the choice is between a policy of unilateral disarmament 
which makes labor unelectable or a policy of realism which is 
unacceptable to large sections of the labor party he said 
kinnock has denied dumping the nonnuclear pledge which the 
party first adopted as official policy in 1982 three years after 
losing power to mrs thatcher but the june 5 interview was his 
strongest indication that a labor government would use britains 
nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in arms control talks with the 
soviets rather than simply scrap them on principle 
the current policy calls also for closing us nuclear bases in 
britain 
in the house of commons on tuesday mrs thatcher reiterated her 
opposition to including trident missiles in arms control talks 
noting it was the equivalent of three percent of the soviet arsenal 
there is no point in giving up 100 percent of our trident 
for the soviet union giving up 3 percent of her strategic 
weapons she said 
polls indicate that while a majority of britons oppose having 
us nuclear weapons in this country many also believe britain 
should remain a nuclear power

michael dukakis promised on tuesday to replace 
the reagan administrations strategic defense initiative with a 
conventional defense initiative to help defend europe against 
soviet attack 
the allbutcertain democratic presidential nominee in a major 
defense and foreign policy speech also said the federal budget 
situation means it is time to make tough choices on defense he 
denied that he was tipping his hand to the soviets by announcing 
opposition to the mx and midgetman missiles 
dukakis declared a strong commitment to nato and outlined a 
stepbystep plan for reducing the risk of war in europe in a 
reference to the soviet union and its allies he said that to 
eliminate the possibility of a surprise attack we have to have 
greater reductions from the side with the most forces the warsaw 
pact 
vice president george bush for his part denounced dukakis as 
wrong wrong for opposing sdi and the mx missile 
hes wrong twice the vice president told reporters in 
washington 
on another foreign policy subject dukakis appeared 
uncomfortable with his partys plan to label south africa a 
terrorist state in its platform as his own representatives agreed 
at a platform drafting session sunday in mackinac island mich 
i tend to resist labels generally because i dont know exactly 
what they mean said dukakis 
but madeleine albright his foreign policy adviser said later 
that dukakis was very comfortable with the evolving platform 
and there is absolutely no distancing himself from what was 
said at the drafting session 
in his speech at the state department before a pronato group 
called the atlantic council dukakis said weve got to be very 
tough on south africa constructive engagements a failure 
south africa is not only engaging in blatant racism against its own 
people and in terrorist acts its committing naked military 
agression against its neighbors all over southern africa 
dukakis also said that if president reagan can achieve an 
agreement with the soviets on longrange missiles in the closing 
months of 1988 i strongly urge the administration to go for it 
and i hope they do 
he declared his commitment to a nato so strong and so united 
that no nation will be tempted to begin a war against us but he 
also said the european allies must bear a greater share of the 
common defense burden 
nato has worked for 40 years it can work for 40 more if our 
allies do their share and if we stop trying to go it alone as we 
have done too often during the past seven years he said 
we all know that the defense budget isnt going to increase in 
real terms unless an emergency arises no matter who the next 
president is he said the time has come to make tough choices on 
defense 
we dont need sdi we need cdi the conventional defense 
initiative begun by leaders in the congress to apply advanced 
technology to the challenge of fighting and winning a conventional 
war he said the strategic defense initiative is the 
administrations proposed spacebased missiledefense system still 
in the research stage 
we dont need mx missiles running around on railroad cars we 
need an antitank weapon that can stop soviet tanks 
asked why he would announce in advance that he opposes such 
mobile weapons as the mx and midgetman missiles dukakis denied 
that he was giving the soviets an advantage at the bargaining 
table he said modernizing the us nuclear arsenal was an open 
question 
later tuesday after returning to massachusetts dukakis 
denounced reagan for allowing coast guard budget cuts that he said 
have hampered the war on drugs 
dukakis held a meeting with rep gerry studds dmass and 
leaders of a regional drug taks force aboard the coast guard cutter 
vigilant and he said the commander told him the ship would remain 
at the docks for the next several months because of the cuts 
this is our first line of defense dukakis said it 
doesnt make any sense we need them 
in washington he called for persuading the soviets to 
withdraw some of their advanced armored equipment from eastern 
europe and to withdraw bridging equipment from their forwardbased 
divisions 
he also called for talks to eliminate the threat of chemical 
warfare not only in europe but throughout the world 
but while we negotiate we must strengthen the alliance as 
well beginning with our conventional forces dukakis said 
the commanders of our armed forces have repeatedly warned us 
of the dangers we face maintenance backlogs are growing we have 
serious shortfalls in airlift and sealift in spare parts and 
ammunition he said

the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee said tuesday his panel will begin writing a tax bill next 
week that will include relief for farmers from the tax on diesel 
fuel 
im encouraged the chairman rep dan rostenkowski dill 
said after separate meetings with democrats and republicans on his 
panel 
the bill likely would be the only tax legislation that has a 
chance of passing congress this year the main purpose of the bill 
would be correcting errors in the 1986 tax overhaul but the 
committee could attach to the bill any of dozens of other tax 
provisions that have been proposed 
however the number of successful amendments is likely to be 
small this year because of budget agreements requiring that any 
provision cutting taxes be offset by another that raises revenues 
most such amendments usually are added when a tax bill goes 
through the senate but rostenkowski said sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas chairman of the finance committee is encouraged that he 
can hold a very well disciplined bill together on the floor of the 
senate that is that he could protect it against serious 
amendment 
thats encouraging to me rostenkowski told reporters 
rostenkowski acknowledged that any bill will include a popular 
provision to excuse farmers and state and local governments from a 
new law requiring them to pay taxes on their purchases of diesel 
fuel and then apply to the treasury for a rebate the finance 
committee already has voted to repeal the requirement 
the chairman said there is considerable support on his committee 
for extending some tax breaks that have expired or are scheduled to 
end later this year these include a tax exemption for revenue 
bonds that help firsttime homebuyers a credit for increased 
research and development and a tax credit that encourages 
employers to hire the poor 
because of budget restrictions rostenkowski said any extension 
of expiring provisions likely would be limited to one or two years 
the chairman indicated there may not be enough support on the 
committee to toughen the tax on unrelated business income of 
organizations that generally are taxexempt some lawmakers 
striving to help small business against unfair competition have 
called for taxation of such income including that from 
universities sale of computers and nonprofit hospitals newstands 
any tax bill that is debated this year is likely to face 
amendment by lawmakers who want to reduce the tax on capital gains 
which are profits from the sale of stocks land and other assets 
this issue is complicated by the fact that advocates of a 
reduction including vice president george bush contend such a 
move would increase tax collections by encouraging investment 
opponents deny it 
another hot issue is a taxpayer bill of rights aimed at 
curbing alleged excesses of the internal revenue service the 
finance committee has approved a version but ways and means 
committee members have been cool to the idea

the senate on tuesday easily approved a bill 
authorizing a bronze statue of an army nurse at the vietnam 
veterans memorial to honor the women who were part of americas 
longest war 
the bill was passed 961 and sent to the house 
sponsored by sen david durenberger rminn the measure had 75 
cosponsors and was endorsed by the interior department 
the statue would be added to the 22 acre vietnam veterans 
memorial located on the mall near the lincoln memorial 
the memorial built with 11 million in private funds was 
opened in 1982 and has become one of the citys most visited 
monuments its polished black granite walls bear the names of the 
more than 58000 vietnam war dead including eight uniformed nurses 
durenberger told his colleagues tuesday the statue would be an 
appropriate and long overdue symbol of this nations gratitude for 
the sacrifices and contributions of the 10000 women who served in 
vietnam 
sen dale bumpers dark called the new statue altogether 
appropriate to honor the women who took part in the vietnam war 
the opposition vote was cast by sen daniel evans rwash who 
also opposed the measure last month when it was approved by the 
energy and natural resources commission 
evans said then that his opposition was based on his belief that 
another statue would destroy the artistic integrity of the vietnam 
memorial 
the female statue also was opposed by the commission of fine 
arts and the national capitol planning commission whose members 
argued the vietnam memorial was already complete and no new statues 
should be added 
maya lin the architect who designed the memorial also opposed 
the addition of the female statue 
in 1984 two years after the original memorial was finished a 
statue of three infantrymen and an american flag were added near 
the end of one of the two walls which comprise the memorial 
durenberger said backers of the bill want to halt the addition 
of any more statutes to the vietnam monument the bill includes a 
provision noting that after the addition of the female statue 
the vietnam veterans memorial will be complete and no other 
additions to the site will be authorized or undertaken

nearly 70 million award to two former vice presidents who claimed 
they were illegally fired for refusing to bribe foreign officials 
or cover up such bribes 
a us district court jury friday awarded bill mckay 44594936 
and harry d williams 24980431 
ashland in a prepared statement said it was very 
disappointed by the verdict which it said was not supported by

who were not government officials

when they were paid and that at least two cases of bribery 
occurred putting the case under the racketeering influence 
corruption act rico a federal law usually aimed at organized 
crime

the government said tuesday it will 
appeal an irish courts release of a man wanted in britain on 
bombing charges the ruling struck a blow to the new britishirish 
extradition agreement 
in london british prime minister margaret thatcher blamed irish 
officials for losing the extradition case and said the two 
governments were holding urgent consultations it was britains 
first extradition attempt under the agreement signed dec 1 
patrick mcveigh 37 was freed monday after a district court 
ruled the irish government had not properly established his 
identity and said british police failed to produce witnesses that 
could identify the suspect 
britain sought his extradition to face charges in connection 
with explosions between 1981 and 1983 in london that killed two 
people outside chelsea barracks and a bomb disposal expert in 
oxford street 
mrs thatcher told the house of commons the crown prosecution 
service have done everything they could they expressly asked 
whether further evidence from the united kingdom on identification 
was needed and was told it was not 
irish justice minister john murray addressing the parliament in 
dublin said the government was very deeply concerned by the 
case and will appeal to the high court 
he said british officials had told irish authorities that no 
british police officer was in a position to make a personal 
identification of patrick mcveigh as the person concerned in the 
alleged offense 
but he said the british officials were told further evidence of 
identification was not required because the information given to 
the court to identify the suspect as mcveigh was in accordance with 
established norms 
mcveigh from belfast northern ireland was arrested may 18 as 
he left portlaoise prison outside dublin after serving five years 
of a sevenyear sentence for arms offenses linked to the irish 
republican army outlawed in both britain and ireland 
mcveigh was seized only days after the british and irish 
governments settled legal differences that had prevented any 
extradition efforts this year under the new pact britain and 
ireland agreed to make positive identification a chief factor in 
extradition 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to unite northern 
ireland a british province where protestants outnumber catholics

we dont need mx missiles running around on railroad cars we 
need an antitank weapon that can stop soviet tanks he said 
referring to reagans proposal for a spacebased missile defense 
system dukakis said we dont need sdi we need cdi the 
conventional defense initiative begun by leaders of the congress to 
apply advanced technology to the challenge of fighting and winning 
a conventional war 
dukakis also said he did not believe the recently approved 
treaty to remove us and soviet mediumrange missiles from europe 
meant a lessening of the us commitment to defense of the 
continent 
i dont buy that at all he said our commitment to europe 
goes far beyond a few hundred missiles 
but he also called for european allies to pay a greater share of 
the burden of maintaining military strength in europe

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
said tuesday that a further decline in the dollar may hurt rather 
than help efforts to reduce the us trade deficit 
greenspan in a speech to the economic club of new york said 
the devaluation of the dollar over the past three years has helped 
narrow the trade gap by dampening demand for more expensive foreign 
goods in the united states and stimulating sales of cheaper us 
goods overseas 
however greenspan said it is questionable whether the united 
states has the capacity to boost production of exports any faster 
than the current growth rate 
thus further declines in the dollar by raising the price of 
imports could actually cause the deficit to grow he said 
i find no adjustment benefit to be derived from a further fall 
in the dollar he said in a text of his speech released in 
washington 
in three years the dollar has lost about half of its value when 
measured against the japanese yen it rose somewhat in trading 
tuesday on the news that the us trade deficit for april had 
fallen to 99 billion its lowest level in nearly 3 years 
it was the second time in less than a week that greenspan has 
spoken against a further drop in the dollar he issued a similar 
warning june 8 after meeting in chicago with other nations central 
bankers 
rather than devaluing the dollar greenspan said in new york 
reducing our federal budget deficit would be the most important 
step we can take in the adjustment process 
on another topic greenspan said despite strained capacity in 
steel and certain chemicals statistics on industrial delivery 
times do not indicate that inflationary bottlenecks are developing 
delivery times for production materials have moved up only 
moderately since late 1985 and have stabilized at least 
temporarily during the past five months he said

moslem guerrillas have punched 
through defenses of afghanistans secondlargest city and delayed 
soviet troop withdrawal western diplomatic sources said tuesday 
the sources speaking on condition their names not be used said 
the guerrillas have penetrated the defenses of kandahar a 
provincial capital of 20000 people about 270 miles southwest of 
kabul afghanistans capital 
one diplomatic source quoting a kandahar resident said 
guerrillas have been entering the citys bazaars daily to hunt 
communist military and government personnel 
the diplomatic sources also said fighting there and the afghan 
army garrison at spin buldak had slowed the soviets pullout from 
kandahar province and increased speculation they may reinforce the 
area with additional troops spin buldak is 60 miles southeast 
kandahar on the pakistani border 
reports indicate the main areas of combat in addition to 
kandahar and kabul are at ghazni to the south khost to the east 
and baghlan city to the north near the soviets main withdrawal 
route 
pakistani sources say the guerrillas have taken the offensive 
this spring capturing more than 25 towns and communist posts in 
the last three months 
however the diplomatic sources said moscows overall withdrawal 
from the country was continuing with convoys last weekend heading 
north through kabul from the eastern garrisons of ghazni and gardez 
they agreed with kremlin figures that 13000 red army troops 
have crossed the oxus river onto home territory since the 
ninemonth pullout began may 15 under an accord negotiated in 
geneva 
afghanistans marxist president najib said at the united 
nations last week that 34000 soviets had left about a third of 
the more than 100000 soviets in afghanistan 
in moscow tuesday a foreign ministry official said soviet 
troops on their way out of afghanistan will strike back at moslem 
guerrillas who attack 
vadim i kuznetsov deputy head of the ministrys us desk 
said that under the geneva withdrawal accords our troops were 
not supposed to take part in combat as they withdraw now they can 
obviously they are going to defend themselves 
kuznetsov told the associated press there had been casualties 
but that he was unable to give the extact time place and extent of 
the attacks 
his remarks were the most detailed explanation of a warning 
issued monday by kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev and najib that 
violations of the accord would bring resolute retaliatory steps 
soviet troops came to afghanistan in 1979 to bolster the 
communist government 
the indian embassy which already closed its missions in 
kandahar and the eastern city of jalalabad has begun evacuating 
personnel from kabul according to the source 
that report appeared to contradict assertions this week by 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi that survival prospects for 
najibs government were good

investigators have removed a broken deceleration 
device from an alaska airlines jet that veered from a runway after 
landing and injured five passengers officials said tuesday 
the device called a thrust reverser slows planes during 
landings by diverting a jet engines thrust the recovery provided 
a possible explanation of why the boeing 727200 failed to stop on 
the runway sunday night at seattletacoma international airport 
we dont know when it occurred but one side of the twopiece 
unit worked and the other was broken said candace carrera the 
national transportation safety boards investigator in charge 
the broken piece could create a twisting motion of the 
aircraft ms carrerra said adding thats getting into analysis 
and were just not that far yet 
the broken thrust reverser was on the center engine of the 
threeengine jet ms carrerra said 
investigators were disassembling the piece and will send it to 
ntsb laboratories in washington dc for further testing she 
said other plane parts were being tested in seattle 
representatives of seattlebased boeing were assisting in the 
investigation 
five of the 75 passengers aboard were injured slightly when 
flight 187 from tucson ariz veered 400 feet off the runway and 
slid to a stop in mud said margo spellman a spokeswoman for 
seatac airport two were treated and released at area hospitals 
three were treated at the scene 
airport officials earlier said four passengers were injured 
interviews with pilot jim wiley 40 and the six other crew 
members monday failed to shed any fresh light on the cause of the 
accident ms carrera said 
investigators appear to have ruled out a tire blowout as the 
cause she said when the jets wheels were dug from the mud 
monday the left tire of the twotire nose landing gear was found 
to be flat 
it wasnt a blowout it was a deflated tire it scraped off 
rubber while trying to stop ms carrera said

some residents of a quiet tampa neighborhood 
say they are unhappy and fearful to find that their new neighbor is 
lawrence singleton who was convicted in california of raping a 
girl and chopping her arms off 
we dont want him here let them ship him back to 
california said winston whittle a retiree living directly 
across the street maybe commmunity pressure could be put on him 
if it could be done out in california it could be done here 
singleton 60 was convicted of raping a 15yearold hitchhiker 
chopping her arms off above the elbow and leaving her for dead 
along a rural roadside southeast of san francisco in 1978 the 
former merchant seaman who grew up in tampa served eight years of 
a 14year sentence 
when singleton was released on parole residents of a number of 
california communities raised loudly vocal campaigns when their 
communities were mentioned as possible homes for the notorious 
inmate one town even filed a lawsuit 
eventually singleton wound up serving his parole while housed 
in a mobile home on the grounds of san quentin prison 
after he finished parole in april singleton came back to his 
home town and for his florida drivers license registered his 
address as that of his brother walter singleton in the forest 
hills section of tampa 
on monday he also registered with the florida department of law 
enforcement to satisfy a state law requiring felons entering the 
state to register with authorities 
ed williams agent in charge of the enforcement agency in tampa 
said singleton was photographed and fingerprinted and told agents 
he was receiving social security 
forest hills is a quiet wellkept section where houses sit on 
big lots shaded by spreading oaks many of the residents are 
retired 
men in the area say women especially widows and those living 
alone are afraid 
a grayhaired lady who lives with her sister and their little 
white poodle acknowledged being worried naturally were 
afraid she said asking that her name not be used 
robert hosak lives next door to whittle he has owned his own 
home for 20 years and says walter singleton and his wife diane have 
lived across the street for about that same length of time 
she has been a good neighbor hosak said of mrs singleton 
i feel sorry for the family hes a relative what can they do 
hosak said he followed the singleton case 10 years ago in the 
newspapers but didnt know until monday that singleton was related 
to the family in his neighborhood 
the fault isnt his its the systems fault for letting him 
out hosak said 
lillian shepler also doesnt like the idea of singleton living 
nearby 
i feel he needs custodial care being shunted wherever he goes 
is no picnic she said but the courts have found him guilty 
and you have to live with the knowledge that hes living next door 
you never know someone could go beserk 
singleton tries to avoid headlines and maintains his innocence 
saying he has considered filing a complaint against the woman he 
was convicted of raping the woman now 24 lives in seclusion in 
the pacific northwest

southern baptists narrowly elected a 
fundamentalist as their president tuesday extending indefinitely 
the march to the right of the nations largest protestant 
denomination 
in the highstakes contest the rev jerry vines got 15804 
votes or 505 percent to defeat the rev richard jackson who had 
15112 or 483 percent 
two other surprise nominees got a small scattering of ballots 
james craig a tulsa okla engineer had 276 votes the rev anis 
shorrosh of mobile ala who had nominated himself received 82 
vines victory for a oneyear term which is traditionally 
renewed for a second year extended the fundamentalist wings 
denominational control into the 10th year it said it needed to 
enact its conservative theologicalpolitical agenda 
vines 50 is copastor of the first baptist church of 
jacksonville fla while runnerup jackson 49 is pastor of the 
north phoenix baptist church in phoenix ariz each church has 
about 18000 members 
because of the size and countrywide influence of the 147 
million member denomination the direction set here was seen as 
having an impact in broader evangelical circles 
about 35000 messengers as local church representatives are 
called were present for the opening day of the southern baptist 
conventions meeting which runs through thursday 
before the election the outgoing president the rev adrian 
rogers of memphis tenn unleashed a scathing attack on 
denominational liberals which is what fundamentalists call the 
moderates 
they have turned protestant christianity into a graveyard 
he said 
likening them to leaven of the pharisees he said such 
theological morticians have no right in baptist pulpits 
the rev russell dilday president of southwestern baptist 
theological seminary in fort worth texas criticized rogers 
divisive tone 
there was a frantic note a pulling out of all the stops as 
if fearful of the election outcome dilday told reporters i 
think our baptist forefathers would be shocked 
moderates who have been gradually cut out of power by the 
prolonged fundamentalist surge have indicated theyre not pulling 
out and splitting the denomination 
were not dead and im not quitting said the rev winfred 
moore of amarillo texas a moderate leader 
but he derided compromise with fundamentalists demands my 
granddaddy was absolutely right he said son theres nothing in 
the middle of the road but a yellow line and dead possums moore 
told a side meeting of moderate pastors 
zoological analogies also got a preelection airing in the 
fundamentalist camp where a fiery dallas leader the rev wa 
criswell declared 
liberals today call themselves moderates a skunk by any other 
name still stinks 
bringing out the sociopolitical aspects of the fundamentalist 
drive he blamed the curse of liberalism for turning the nation 
over to secularists humanists atheists and infidels 
by law and legislation we bow at no altar and call on the 
name of no god he said no longer can we pray in public 
schools read gods word or have chapel services in public 
schools or place a nativity scene on the courthouse lawn 
among american christians southern baptists always have been 
pervasively conservative in their theology stressing the autonomy 
of local congregations churchstate separation no creedal rules 
but the bible and soul competence of individuals to interpret 
it as they understand it 
but the fundamentalist wing that won predominance in 1979 and 
has held it since insists on viewing the bible as literalistically 
inerrant without error historically religiously and 
scientifically 
under the shiboleth of inerrancy the fundamentalist wing 
has pressed a wide sociopolitical program generally identified 
with the new religious right that emerged about the same time at 
the turn of the 1980s 
as the fundamentalists gained sway over institutional trustees 
through presidential appointive powers several organizational and 
seminary staff members have been hit by restrictions and pressures 
that drove them from their posts 
screening processes have been instituted to make sure personnel 
adhere to certain beliefs such as that adam and eve were real 
people and that biblical miracles actually occurred 
also policies were invoked against women clergy and employing 
divorced pastors in most cases 
baptist fundamentalists unavailingly backed judge robert bork 
for the us supreme court contrary to baptist practice against 
taking sides about particular candidates 
the fundamentalist wing also has marshalled the denomination for 
other religious right causes prayer in public schools capital 
punishment and condemning all abortion except to save the mothers

dutch riot police battled west 
german and dutch demonstrators outside a courthouse in amsterdam on 
tuesday where a suspect in the murder of two west german policemen 
was fighting extradition 
a running street battle began during a hearing on the 
extradition of 25yearold frank hoffmann to west germany 
hoffmann a west german citizen denies involvement in the nov 
2 shootings which occurred during a demonstration against building 
a new runway at frankfurts rheinmain airport 
hoffmann wore a leg restraint during the hearing 
defense attorney pieter bakker schut argued that the killings 
were political crimes for which dutch law bans extradition 
public prosecutor m bonn conceded the two killings were 
politically influenced but argued they could not be regarded as 
political crimes 
a ruling on the extradition request is set for june 28 
at least eight protesters were arrested in the fighting outside 
said police spokesman leo detering police used baton charges to 
disperse about 100 protesters many of them masked to avoid 
identification 
dozens of flakjacketed police stood guard inside and outside 
the courthouse and four armed guards were detailed to hoffman 
aside from those directly involved in the proceedings only 
reporters were allowed inside the courtroom about 30 hoffmann 
sympathizers watched from a public gallery separated from the 
courtroom by bulletproof glass 
west german authorities say hoffmann shot the west german 
officers with a police service pistol he stole during the protest 
he also is charged with the attempted murder of two other policemen 
during the protest 
west germany also wants hoffmann for alleged membership in an 
unspecified terrorist organization and for attacks against 
property in protests against west germanys nuclear energy program 
hoffmann denied involvement in all instances he grinned at his 
sympathizers and yelled rebellion resistance as police 
hustled him out of the courtroom at the end of the hearing

evan mechams defense lawyer told a jury 
tuesday the former governor is being unjustly prosecuted by a 
politically ambitious attorney general whose aides are like the 
guards at auschwitz 
the prosecution wants a conviction in this case 
notwithstanding the innocence of these defendants lawyer michael 
scott said in closing arguments in maricopa county superior court 
prosecutor michael cudahy insisted mecham and his brother 
willard purposely concealed a 350000 campaign loan from 
developer barry wolfson on financial reports required by the state 
evan mecham never had any intention of disclosing the wolfson 
loan cudahy said 
the prosecution was scheduled to finish its rebuttal wednesday 
morning before the case is submitted to the jury for deliberations 
im glad this day is here mecham 64 told reporters before 
the arguments began i want to get it over with i want to get on 
with my life 
scott told the jurors that there was no motive to conceal 
wolfson as the source of the loan because the campaigns financial 
reports were filed after the november 1986 election 
the defense lawyer said mecham could have been charged with a 
misdemeanor for false campaign finance reporting but a 
misdemeanor is not good enough for attorney general bob corbin 
and his henchmen 
corbin wanted a conviction on felony charges to further his own 
political ambitions but he is not entitled to bring home evan 
mechams scalp and hang it in the trophy room at the attorney 
generals office scott said 
perhaps i shouldnt be so hard on my colleagues because like 
the guards at auschwitz theyre just doing their job he said 
referring to the prosecutors 
auschwitz was a nazi death camp 
in his rebuttal coprosecutor barnett lotstein accused scott of 
making a vicious personal attack on him and cudahy its not 
a new tactic its used when you dont have anything else to say 
lotstein said 
cudahy said mecham desperately needed money for his 1986 
gubernatorial campaign which had a theme of integrity and 
abolishing special interests 
along came a pot of gold in the form of barry wolfson and 
evan mecham wound up selling that theme of integrity and ridding 
the state of hidden special interests when he and willard mecham 
decided to hide from the public the 350000 loan cudahy said 
cudahy said testimony showed that even some of mechams top 
aides and people who signed promissory notes to back the loan were 
not told it was coming from wolfson and not from a bank 
the loan was hidden on a campaign financial report as part of a 
fabricated 465000 lump sum listed as a contribution from 
mecham cudahy said he also pointed to a letter in which mecham 
promised wolfson the loan would remain confidential 
scott contended that the loan was properly reported as part of 
the 465000 lump sum because mecham was responsible for its 
repayment 
mecham was charged with six felony counts of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents and faced up to 22 years in 
prison if convicted 
willard mecham who was his brothers 1986 campaign treasurer 
faced three similar counts and up to 9 years in prison if 
convicted 
mecham a republican took office in january 1987 and was 
removed april 4 when the state senate convicted him of two 
unrelated charges

five strategic heights in new battles on the northern front while 
iran reported that the iraqis suffered 19000 casualties in their 
southern offensive 
the official iraqi news agency said iraqi forces backed by 
helicopter gunships and fighter planes stormed iranianheld 
positions in northern iraq to win back the heights 
it said artillery tank and infantry units joined in retaking 
five iranian positions in the mountain peaks of suliamaniya 
province but it did not say when the offensive started or how long 
it lasted 
iranian news reports made no mention of fighting in the north 
irans islamic republic news agency said iranian forces killed or 
wounded 19000 iraqis after launching a new offensive east of basra 
in southern iraq on monday 
the various reports were monitored in nicosia claims by the 
opposing sides could not be independently verified as both 
countries rarely allow independent observers near the 730mile 
front the war began in september 1980 
the iranian military communique said more than 1500 iraqis were 
killed or wounded tuesday and that irans heavy artillery destroyed 
tanks personnel carriers and other vehicles 
iran also claimed that iraqi warplanes dropped chemical weapons 
on a village in kurdistan province at 8 am tuesday killing two 
villagers and poisoning 10 others according to irna 
iraqs official news agency said tuesday that irans attack in 
the southern zone was contained and iraqi troops counterattacked

sanctions should be imposed against iran for attacks on iraqi 
territory 
in the persian gulf iranian gunboats riddled a 
singaporeflagged tanker with machinegun fire as the tanker

of parliament and commander in chief of irans armed forces as 
saying he was pessimistic about iraq surrendering in the war 
rafsanjani was quoted as saying iran is not insisting on 
getting our rights on the battlefield with military means 
that could indicate a softening in irans avowed determination 
to crush the iraqi government but rafsanjani also spoke of irans 
insistence that the war will end only when president saddam hussein 
of iraq is ousted 
iraq has expressed its willingness to accept a un security 
council resolution passed last year calling for a ceasefire but 
iran has not 
in february 1986 iran captured the faw peninsula near basra but 
was driven out by an iraqi offensive last april iran launched new 
attacks in late may to regain the peninsula at the northern tip of 
the gulf and both sides have claimed victories

a member of the irish republican army should 
be deported to the united kingdom attorney general edwin meese iii 
ruled tuesday declaring that sending the man to ireland instead 
would be prejudicial to us interests 
meese disapproved a decision by the board of immigration 
appeals which had ruled there was insufficient evidence that 
deportation of joseph patrick thomas doherty to ireland would be 
against us interest 
doherty was convicted in the united kingdom in 1981 of murder in 
the ambush of a british army convoy in which a captain was killed 
doherty escaped from a prison in belfast northern ireland 
before sentencing came to the united states in 1982 and has been 
held in the metropolitan correctional center in new york city since 
1983 on charges he illegally entered the country using a false 
passport 
doherty designated ireland as the country to which he wished to 
be deported 
in reversing the board of immigration appeals meese said us 
policy is that those who commit acts of violence against a 
democratic state should receive swift and lawful punishment and 
that doherty should serve his sentence in the united kingdom 
michael armacost undersecretary of state for political affairs 
wrote the attorney general that a decision to deport doherty to 
ireland would injure relations with the united kingdom 
failure to return doherty to the united kingdom could 
undermine great britains confidence in the ability of the 
united states to cooperate in counterterrorism efforts of special 
bilateral concern armacost said portions of the letter were 
printed in meeses decision 
meeses decision was denounced by a new york republican 
politician who is an activist for irish causes 
im demanding that meese resign because im charging that hes 
betrayed the constitution by ordering joseph doherty deported to 
the united kingdom said peter king nassau county comptroller 
and the unsuccessful republican nominee for new york state attorney 
general in 1986 
every court has ruled in favor of doherty and yet meese is 
ordering him deported to a prison where he will be tortured and 
spend the rest of his life in jail king said he is entitled 
to political status in this country 
the board of immigration appeals now must rule on dohertys 
request to withdraw an earlier admission that he is deportable if 
his request to withdraw the earlier admission is unsuccessful 
doherty would be deported to the united kingdom 
if he prevails he could file a request seeking asylum in the 
united states or file a request for deportation to a country 
besides ireland or the united kingdom 
meese acted on an appeal filed by the us immigration and 
naturalization service which had objected to ireland as the 
country to which doherty should be sent 
ins supplied an immigration judge with newspaper articles and 
speeches on the issue of terrorism but was unsuccessful in its 
arguments after failing to submit additional evidence the appeals 
panel upheld the immigration judges ruling

for a trove of gold silver and emeralds that had laid undisturbed 
for centuries on the bottom of the sea until found by treasure 
hunter mel fisher 
a 62inchlong gold chain formed from 136 oval links attracted 
the most attention and fetched 319000 in spirited but quick 
bidding the chain purchased by an anonymous telephone bidder had 
an estimated presale price of 150000 to 250000 
the auction was the first of a twoday sale at christies 
auction house of booty recovered from spanish sailing ships 
discovered in the caribbean by fisher a diver who has devoted much 
of his life to treasure hunting 
the auction house said more than 70 percent of the items offered 
tuesday were sold for a total of 2588443 
the treasure which included gold and silver bars jewelry and 
artifacts as well as coins emeralds and 17th century navigation 
instruments was taken mostly from the spanish treasure galleons 
nuestra senora de atocha and her sister ship the santa margarita 
the two vessels battered by a hurricane went down off the

president daniel ortega and his 
cabinet on tuesday discussed dramatic new economic policies that 
lift price and wage controls the presidents office said 
details were not immediately known but it appeared the leftist 
sandinista government was moving away from central control toward a 
westernstyle free market 
enrique bolanos president of the superior private enterprise 
council said his umbrella group for privately owned businesses 
supports the removal of price controls but he warned it might 
further fuel inflation now running at about 4000 percent 
ortega failed to show up for a news conference tuesday and his 
office said he was held up by meetings with cabinet members 
ortega announced on saturday that the government was withdrawing 
a wage scale in effect since 1985 the idea he said was to link 
wages to productivity sharply down in recent years 
but some speculation arose that basing salaries on production 
might cause a surge in unemployment 
six years of civil war coupled with us trade sanctions enacted 
in 1985 have shattered the nicaraguan economy 
for all intents and purposes nicaragua at the end of 1987 was 
a bankrupt country said a us embassy report in january 
nicaragua has a foreign debt of more than 6 billion soviet 
bloc infusions of about 400 million a year fail to cover the 
countrys trade deficit 
from 1980 to the end of 1987 inflation caused the average urban 
workers purchasing power to drop almost 90 percent 
the government has controlled salaries basic foodstuffs the 
prices of primary products and the distribution of imports and 
exports 
measures taken by the government have failed to right the 
economy which was in disarray when the sandinistas came to power 
in a 1979 revolution that deposed dictator anastasio somoza 
the sandinistas promised broad social programs and benefits but 
the war by the usbacked rebels known as contras started a little 
more than a year after the revolution 
today despite a fragile threemonth ceasefire about 60 
percent of the national budget goes toward defense the sandinistas 
put the wars pricetag at 3 billion 
thousands of nicaraguans fled the fighting for the cities 
leaving behind fertile lands in the northern and central war zones 
young peasants who normally would work on farms are forced to fight 
for either the contras or the sandinistas 
in april the government began laying off 20000 public 
employees in hopes they would turn to agriculture

members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries

analysts in vienna said an extension of the accord highlighted

levels and reach a new agreement the agreement already has been 
extended once from last december until this month because the 
13 opec members could not reach a new pact 
one opec faction wants to cut production to push weak oil prices 
higher another including saudi arabia wants to increase 
production or at least maintain it at current levels to take 
advantage of an expected increase in demand in the second half of

major banks are applauding the supreme courts ruling that banks 
can use subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in some securities as 
another step toward their industrys expansion into lucrative 
investment banking 
some banking companies including bankers trust new york corp 
and chemical new york corp said monday that they planned to take 
advantage of their new underwriting powers before the end of the 
week others such as chase manhattan corp said they would begin 
operations some time this summer 
the supreme courts ruling monday upheld a lower court decision 
permitting banks to use subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in 
municipal revenue bonds mortgagerelated securities and commercial 
paper a form of shortterm corporate iou 
the federal reserve board had granted such powers to seven of 
the nations biggest banks but restricted the activity to no more 
than 5 percent to 10 percent of the subsidarys gross revenue that 
action was appealed by the securities industry association 
in its decision the supreme court let stand an appeals court 
ruling four months ago that such activity did not violate the 
depressionera glasssteagall act 
the law passed by congress in the wake of the 1929 stock market 
crash was aimed primarily at protecting the financial stability of 
banks by restricting them from speculating in stocks and bonds 
congressional legislation is pending to repeal parts of the law 
rep fernand j st germain dri said the courts decision 
would not deter the house banking committee which he chairs from 
legislating such ground rules 
a majority of the banking committee feel that it is a 
mistake to alllow the future structure of the financial community

carl c icahn says he has put 3102 million 
into an escrow account to be divided among texaco inc shareholders 
if he fails to come up with financing for his 60pershare offer 
to buy the company 
at its white plains ny headquarters the nations 
thirdlargest oil company reacted skeptically to the action monday 
by its biggest shareholder saying icahn had been caught 
redhanded giving the texaco shareholder false and misleading 
information 
given the number of strings and conditions that remain 
attached to this money it doesnt matter to the texaco shareholder 
what account icahn puts it in texaco stated he can move it 
from one pocket to another as much as he wants we are still 
convinced it will never get to texaco shareholders 
icahn also said he had sent a signed bare bones 60 a share 
merger agreement to the company 
if texaco executes the merger agreement we will terminate our 
proxy contest and withdraw our slate of nominees the statement 
said referring to icahns attempt to elect himself and four 
colleagues to texacos board of directors 
texaco has said repeatedly it was not interested in icahns 
advances 
texacos stock slid 137 to 5050 a share monday in 
consolidated nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted 
issues it has remained in the 50pershare range since icahn 
launched his bid last month 
icahn has offered to pay 124 billion for the 207 million 
texaco shares he does not already own he paid about 12 billion 
for his existing stake of about 36 million shares the offer puts a 
value of 146 billion on the oil company 
but texaco has refused to put icahns buyout offer to a 
shareholder vote prompting him to field the slate of five 
candidates for texaco 14member board icahn has said he wants the 
seats on texacos board so he can pressure it into putting his 
offer before the shareholders 
the proxy fight deadline is friday when texaco holds its annual 
meeting in tulsa okla 
originally icahn offered to put 100 million in escrow to ease 
market suspicions that he could not come up with the money actually 
to buy the company 
last week icahn increased the guarantee to 300 million and 
promised it would be distributed directly to texaco shareholders 
instead of the company treasury if he failed to get financing 
icahns statement that 310201955 in cash was placed in escrow 
with fleet national bank of providence ri 150 per share for 
all texaco stockholders eligible to vote on the special meeting he 
is seeking apparently was designed to stifle texacos criticism 
that he was unlikely ever to have to pay the money 
icahn said the escrow would be forfeited if at the time of the 
special stockholders meeting to vote on his offer the financing 
was not in place 
he said the escrow would not be forfeited if by the time of the 
meeting another entity made a legitimate bid for more than 60 per 
share or if the internal revenue service failed to give required 
approval to icahns proposal 
icahn said friday he was forming a new holding company to act as 
his sole vehicle for acquisitions including a possible hostile 
takeover bid for texaco he said the holding company intended to 
raise up to 325 billion through an offering of stock and debt 
securities 
icahn stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of the 
texaco board refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer he 
would consider making a hostile bid for it through the new holding 
company at yet to be determined terms

a continuing decline in the number of us 
business starts reflects the nations changing economic profile and 
not necessarily broad economic problems according to a business 
information concern 
the number of new domestic businesses declined by 66 percent to 
53382 in the first three months of the year the seventh straight 
quarterly drop from 57158 in first quarter 1987 according to 
dun amp bradstreet corp 
dun amp bradstreet officials cited the maturing of the nations 
economic expansion now in its sixth year and a shift from 
consumerism to exportdriven growth as factors in the decline of 
business starts a barometer of economic activity and moneymaking 
opportunities 
joseph w duncan dun amp bradstreets corporate economist and 
chief statistician said new retailing businesses fell because of 
expectations that consumer demand will weaken and startups of new 
service businesses fell in response to increased competition and 
corporate budget reductions 
retailing and service concerns account for about half of all new 
businesses 
while the current surge in us exports will create new 
business opportunities in some sectors existing manufacturers are 
the primary beneficiaries duncan said in a report of the latest 
figures 
business starts are considered important because they signal the 
level of entrepreneurial activity and perceived opportunities for 
profit in local area markets but a persistent decline in starts 
does not necessarily indicate a broader economic problem said reid 
gearhart a dun amp bradstreet spokesman 
with the recovery in its sixth year thats just having a 
dampening effect he said its not really a negative 
dun amp bradstreet data indicated firstquarter business starts 
fell in seven of the nine major industry sectors the largest 
decrease came in the financeinsurancereal estate category which 
fell 98 percent retail business starts dropped 81 percent and 
services fell 57 percent 
starts also fell in the construction manufacturing wholesale 
and transportation sectors with decreases of between 5 percent and 
8 percent 
increases were in agriculture up 115 percent and mining up 
23 percent 
both mining which includes oil and gas extraction businesses 
and agriculture appear to be turning the corner after several years 
of severe stress duncan said 
despite a drop in manufacturingrelated business starts there 
was evidence that export growth was encouraging some entrepreneurs 
duncan said an analysis of manufacturing starts showed significant 
increases among motor vehicle and equipment makers metal producers 
and office equipment manufacturers 
geographically firstquarter starts fell nationwide with the 
largest decreases in the rocky mountain states down 156 percent 
other significant drops occurred in the middle atlantic states 
down 122 percent and the west north central states down 12 
percent 
starts in new england dropped only 11 percent while starts in 
the south atlantic and east north central states were both down 33 
percent starts fell 38 percent in the pacific states 67 percent 
in east south central states and 63 percent in west south central 
states 
dun amp bradstreet describes itself as the worlds largest 
marketer of business information and related services with revenue 
of 34 billion in 1987

the government is trying to tame the wide 
swings in the monthly us trade deficit changes which in the past 
have sent stock prices plunging but analysts are not sure the 
effortwill be a success 
financial markets were braced for more bad news today with 
release of the trade deficit for april in advance of the report 
many economists were predicting the deficit could widen to around 
123 billion compared to a march deficit of 119 billion 
the last time the trade deficit widened when the february 
figure was reported the dollar came under intense selling pressure 
worldwide and the dow jones industrial average fell by 101 points 
its fifthworst loss ever 
analysts didnt expect such a dramatic reaction to this report 
mainly because financial markets already were expecting the april 
deficit to be higher however if it came in much higher than the 
expected 123 billion it had the potential to set off alarms in 
financial markets 
for the first time in two years the government has begun 
seasonally adjusting the monthly deficit figures to take into 
account normal seasonal changes in shipping patterns 
most government statistics are adjusted to factor out 
fluctuations which occur on a seasonal basis such as the normal 
rise in retail sales right before christmas 
the government was forced to abandon seasonal adjustments of the 
trade figures in december 1985 because of lags in gathering the 
data those problems have since been corrected and seasonal 
adjustments are being reintroduced 
by adjusting for normal seasonal swings the government hopes to 
make the trade series less erratic and therefore ease the jolt 
financial markets sometimes receive 
a string of bad monthly trade figures was blamed for adding to 
the pessimistic mood right before last octobers stock market crash 
and there have been other periodic jolts including the big drop in 
the stock market after the february deficit figure was released 
but allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said he did 
not believe the seasonal adjustments will do much to smooth out the 
monthly swings because of the erratic nature of trade shipments 
when any single month can be affected by a number of factors 
in fact one reason analysts were looking for a wider deficit 
figure in april was the absence of gold shipments to taiwan in 
march the taiwan government purchased over 700 million in gold as 
a way of lowering its trade surplus with the united states which 
has been pressuring taiwan to do more to open up its country to 
american goods 
even with erratic monthtomonth swings economists are 
optimistic that the overall trade deficit which hit a record 
1703 billion is finally headed lower 
the trade deficit is slowly turning and that should be the 
story for the rest of the year sinai said 
a recent survey by the national association of business 
economists showed they expect the trade defict to decline to around 
150 billion this year and 125 billion in 1989

opec ministers reached agreement today to 
extend their existing oil output pact for six months but failed to 
take any further steps aimed at limiting production and boosting 
prices 
venezuelan oil minister arturo hernandez grisanti disclosing 
the agreement to reporters at the 13nation cartels regular 
midyear meeting said we think the market will have a good 
perception of what we have done 
nevertheless the agreement confirmed widespread speculation 
that the organization of petroleum exporting countries wouldnt 
agree on significant new moves to cut the world supply of oil 
prices are now substantially below opecs 18perbarrel objective 
on the new york mercantile exchange a sensitive barometer of 
prices the july contract for west texas intermediate crude fell 30 
cents monday to close at 1643 a barrel partly in anticipation of 
the opec agreement reached today 
the ministers who began their conference on saturday gathered 
to decide whether to change the agreement among 12 of the producers 
that limits output to 1506 million barrels a day 
delegation sources said the ministers had haggled over whether 
to extend the accord by three months or six months the accord was 
to have expired june 30 
highlevel sources in several delegations speaking on condition 
of anonymity earlier said a majority of the opec ministers had 
favored the shorter extension but the minority favoring the 
longer extension included influential saudi arabia opecs biggest 
producer 
analysts had said the prospect of yet another extension 
highlighted opecs inability to overcome its differences on 
production levels and agree on a common formula to raise prices 
one opec faction has wanted to cut production to push prices up 
to the target level the saudiled minority has wanted to increase 
production or at least maintain it at current levels to take 
advantage of an increase in demand expected in the second half of 
the year and to maintain opecs market share 
iraq refused to sign the current accord because it wants a quota 
equal to that of iran with which it has been at war since 1980 
opec president rilwanu lukman nigerias oil minister said it was 
unlikely iraq would participate in the latest agreement 
lukman said monday that the ministers were working hard on a 
compromise to bring iraq back into the fold 
iran has a daily production quota of 2369 million barrels 
iraq which previously had a quota of 154 million barrels a day 
is producing 26 million barrels daily 
success on that front would lower iraqs production which could 
help boost oil prices 
the united arab emirates oil minister mana saeed oteiba left 
the talks on sunday he said he needed to consult with his 
government and might or might not return although he left the rest 
of the uae delegation behind 
hernandez however said it was likely otgiba would return today 
to sign the rollover agreement 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

while most beer companies grapple with a 
stagnant market anheuserbusch inc is soaking up customers and 
leaving some observers scratching their heads 
thats the 64 question said frank walters research 
director for m shanken communications in new york which publishes 
beverage industry magazines 
since the beginning of the decade anheuser has raised its share 
of the market from 28 percent to nearly 40 percent largely due to 
growth in budweiser sales which have bubbled from 35 million 
barrels in 1980 to 50 million last year 
the answers given for the companys success range from superior 
marketing and management to high quality products to other factors 
that are less tangible 
for example budweiser appears to succeed in getting consumers 
at an early age and keeping them said emanuel goldman an analyst 
with montgomery securities in san francisco 
if beer customers want to try a different brand and that 
product happens to be unavailable then the consumers most commonly 
choose a budweiser analysts say 
its become everybodys no 2 brand said john collopy who 
follows the beer industry and is president of the milwaukee 
investment firm cleary gull reiland mcdevitt amp collopy inc 
robert weinberg a st louis analyst who is a former anheuser 
executive said some of the brewers successful strategies emerged 
after the company was bruised by its current main competitor 
miller brewing co in milwaukee 
weinberg said miller was first to use the marketing technique of 
putting the consumer at the center of an ad with the miller high 
life slogan if youve got the time weve got the beer 
it had anheuserbusch spinning through 1975 weinberg said 
and miller was able to eat away much of anheusers lead 
but anheuser he said responded with its own consumeroriented 
slogan this buds for you which helped the company recapture 
its momentum 
john macdonough vice president of brand management at anheuser 
said advertising alone cannot carry a product 
all i can say is that the consumer is very sensitive he 
said no amount of marketing could keep a product going if you 
dont have a good product 
analysts also note that budweiser has been protected from the 
discount beer battles of miller and stroh brewery co by using the 
busch brand as a shield 
but it might be difficult to maintain budweisers growth as 
anheuser ventures more into the lowcalorie beer market macdonough 
said 
after the light beer market opened up anheuser made a stab with 
natural light which has not taken off like its counterpart lite 
beer at miller 
but anheuser introduced bud light in the early 1980s and while 
the brand has not challenged lite in terms of volume its sales 
have had doubledigit growth each of the past two years 
macdonough acknowledged that anheuser officials were reluctant 
to enter the light beer market with the budweiser name for fear 
that it would eat away budweiser sales similar to what has happened 
at other companies 
we dont like to give people as good a head start as we gave 
lite he said whats unusual is that weve gained that 
terrific growth with bud light and have still grown with 
budweiser 
one of the few areas where anheuser has had problems is with its 
superpremium michelob line which according to goldmans 
estimates has lost an estimated 20 percent since the beginning of 
the decade 
but he noted michelob sales probably were hurt by a strong 
dollar which allowed imported beers to hold down their prices now 
that the dollar has weakened against other currencies he said 
michelobs erosion might subside 
anheuser also has had success selling its beer overseas through 
exporting and licensing agreements

investors scooped up us securities and dollars 
tuesday in response to a surprise plunge in the trade deficit that 
diluted inflation fears depressed interest rates and sent the 
stock market to a postcrash high 
i dont think its an overreaction its a very positive 
development said thom r brown chairman of the investment 
policy committee at the philadelphiabased brokerage butcher amp 
singer inc 
a government report that the april trade deficit shrank to 989 
billion startled many economists and investment strategists who had 
expected a much larger number 
the shrinkage reflected a big drop in americas appetite for 
imports and a lesser decline in exports key concerns of those who 
fear the economy is too strong and much higher inflation is 
inevitable 
the impact was immediately felt in the foreignexchange markets 
where surging demand for dollars strengthened the currencys value 
relative to the japanese yen west german mark and british pound 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of the economy prices 
of the 30year treasury bill soared more than 20 per 1000 in 
face amount its yield which moves inversely to price and is an 
important signal of interest rate trends tumbled to 881 percent 
its lowest level in two months 
the bondmarket rally overflowed into wall street where stock 
prices advanced strongly and sent some key indices to their highest 
closing levels since the the october crash 
volume was heavy an indication that more investors have been 
lured back to the market after a prolonged period of apathy and 
cynicism about stocks 
the interesting thing ive seen today is that individual 
investors are calling to see what stocks we like said peter a 
karos manager of equity and overthecounter trading at piper 
jaffray amp hopwood inc in minneapolis thats the first time ive 
seen that for months its very encouraging 
nevertheless some strategists were cautious about interpreting 
the monthly trade number which historically has been unpredictable 
and subject to major revisions they said the markets were simply 
overlooking other evidence of impending inflation such as higher 
commodity prices and low unemployment 
im somewhat concerned overall because even though 
statistically we dont see the kind of inflation we saw in the late 
1970s were possibly building a fairly good springboard for 
inflation said jack barbanel a futures trader at gruntal amp co 
in new york the market is ignoring it 
stephen b timbers executive vice president and chief 
investment officer at kemper financial services in chicago said 
the trade deficit number showed definite improvement but he also 
expressed skepticism about its significance 
we will undoubtedly have a disappointing figure in the next 
couple of months he said these numbers swing all over the 
place 
even some strategists who were more positive about the trade 
number saw some longterm danger lurking because it signaled a 
possible end to an economic boom in japan a key us trading 
partner that largely relies on the american market for its 
exportoriented economy 
if that happened the roaring japanese stock market could 
tumble setting off a powerful reverberation through other markets 
worldwide especially in the united states 
i dont think investors are paying any attention to this 
which might come back and bite them said brown of butcher amp 
singer the japanese market is so grossly overvalued it could 
come down fast and hard

the dollar leaped in value against most major 
foreign currencies tuesday in reaction to a report that the us 
merchandise trade deficit narrowed in april to a 
betterthanexpected 989 billion 
gold prices finished mixed after initially being knocked down by 
the trade news republic national bank of new york said gold was 
bid at 45015 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt up from 44970 late 
monday 
in its strongest move in months the dollar climbed 16 percent 
against the west german mark although west germanys central bank 
sold dollars in an attempt to stem the us currencys rise 
traders said 
the dollar also rose 17 percent against the british pound and 
by slightly less against other european currencies and the japanese 
yen it slipped against the canadian dollar in part because a 
strong bond rally lowered yields on us securities in comparison 
to canadian securities 
traders said there were no confirmed reports of dollar selling 
by central banks other than west germanys 
many traders had expected the april merchandise trade deficit to 
be about 122 billion instead the gap proved to be the lowest 
since december 1984 
the statistics were quite a shock to the marketplace said 
richard witten a vice president at goldman sachs amp co 
witten said some traders concluded the united states would be 
able to trade its way out of its deficit although he said i 
think its too early to say that 
west germanys intervention briefly suppressed the dollars 
rise but the currency rebounded and finished the session at its 
highs of the day said jeff mondschein vice president and foreign 
exchange manager for merrill lynch capital markets 
in london the dollar strengthened to 17925 to the pound from 
18165 on monday later in new york the dollar strengthened to 
17864 to the pound from 18165 late monday 
before the announcement of the trade figures the dollar closed 
at 12505 japanese yen in tokyo down from 12519 monday in london 
the dollar traded at 12620 yen at the end of the trading day in 
new york the dollar rose to 12655 yen from 12512 yen late monday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late mondays 
rates included 17496 west german marks up from 17227 14626 
swiss francs up from 14408 12183 canadian dollars down from

stocks hit a postcrash high tuesday after 
rallying hard on a betterthanexpected trade report but a late 
wave of profittaking prevented the market from posting even 
sharper gains 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which had been up more 
than 38 points during the session finished at 212447 up 2507 
broader market indices also closed at postcrash highs 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
1091 issues up 432 down and 466 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 22715 million shares 
up sharply from 12531 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
261597 million shares 
analysts were impressed with the markets performance it was 
a good show and the best is yet to come said michael metz a 
vice president and technical analyst at oppenheimer amp co noting 
that theres still room on the upside 
stock prices surged at the opening on a longawaited commerce 
department report that showed the nations seasonally adjusted 
trade deficit narrowed to 989 billion in april far below the 
12plus billion market watchers had been anticipating 
the report also sparked a rally in the bond market and helped 
push the dollar higher against the major currencies 
analysts noted that the markets embraced the trade report 
because it showed a decline in exports which eased by 25 percent 
and worked to dispel concerns that the economy is expanding too 
quickly imports declined by 64 percent in april 
the trade figures suggest the consumer boom is slackening but 
manufacturing activity is rising which is ideal said metz who 
predicted a soft landing from fears of inflation and an 
overheated economy 
the dow average which had been flirting with the 2100 mark for 
weeks decisively pierced that point at the opening and traders 
watched closely as the key index ticked past incremental barriers 
the buying spree was broadbased throughout the session 
the blue chips basked in all this strength but there is 
greater growth and percentage opportunities in the 
mediumcapitalization stocks and they also performed well noted 
eugene peroni a technical analyst at janney montgomery scott in 
philadelphia 
while cash that had been sitting on the sidelines for weeks 
poured into the market analysts noted that the enthusiasm had some 
bounds 
theres still a lot of skeptics in the background which is a 
bullish phenomenon in and of itself metz said

the us trade deficit shrank to 989 billion 
in april its best showing in more than three years the government 
said tuesday in a betterthanexpected report which sparked a big 
rally on wall street 
the commerce department said that the april deficit narrowed by 
155 percent from a seasonally adjusted march deficit figure of 
1170 billion with all of the improvement coming from a steep 
drop in imports 
the trade figure which has often rattled world financial 
markets was greeted as exceptionally good news by investors who 
rushed to bid up the price of us stocks and bonds they also sent 
the value of the dollar surging on foreign exchange markets 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials jumped 2507 points to 
close at 212447 a postcrash high 
many economists had been braced for a widening of the deficit to 
around 122 billion based on an assumption that exports could not 
hold at the record level set in march exports did edge down by 25 
percent but the small drop still left them at 2622 billion the 
second highest level on record 
meanwhile imports plunged 64 percent to 3611 billion 
reflecting big drops in american purchases of foreign cars and 
capital equipment including computers 
private analysts said the string of better trade numbers 
virtually assured that president reagan would win his veto battle 
with congress over trade legislation 
the argument for protectionism is fast disappearing as our 
trade deficit improves said frank mccormick senior economist 
with bank of america 
for the first four months of the year the trade deficit has 
been running at an annual rate of 1418 billion a big improvement 
from the record 1703 billion deficit suffered in 1987 
while many economists had been expecting a decline to around 
150 billion some said they were now revising their forecasts to 
show even more of an improvement this year 
zaharo sofianou senior economist for the boston co economic 
advisers said she believed the trade deficit would dip to between 
130 billion and 140 billion this year as exports continue to lead 
overall us economic growth 
for the past year american manufacturers have been enjoying an 
export boom as a weaker dollar has made their products competitive 
again on overseas markets 
the trade report came at a particularly good time for president 
reagan who will depart sunday for his eighth and final economic 
summit in toronto the administration hopes to use the summit as a 
forum to promote reagans freemarket philosophy and cement gains 
made in the past three years on closer international cooperation 
the april improvement gave the country its first singledigit 
trade deficit since a 990 billion imbalance in august 1985 it 
was the lowest imbalance since an 803 billion deficit in december 
1984 
the march deficit was originally reported as a singledigit 
figure as well at 97 billion but that was before the department 
made adjustments for normal seasonal fluctuations beginning with 
the april report these adjustments will be made on a monthly basis 
in an effort to smooth out erratic monthtomonth swings which have 
often sent financial markets into a tailspin 
a higherthanexpected february report sent the dollar plunging 
and pushed the dow jones industrial average down by 101 points its 
fifth worst loss ever and bad trade numbers last fall were blamed 
for contributing to market anxiety before the oct 19 stock market 
crash 
the april improvement in imports reflected an 8 percent drop in 
foreign purchases of capital goods including computers shipments 
of foreign cars and parts fell 46 percent while purchases of other 
foreign consumer goods dropped 7 percent 
i think we have reached the highwater mark on imports and we 
will see gradual declines from now on said jerry jasinowski 
chief economist of the national association of manufacturers 
oil imports rose in april by 35 percent to 335 billion 
the 25 percent drop in exports represented small declines in a 
number of areas which were offset in part by a 05 percent rise in 
food sales which climbed to 259 billion 
the countrys largest trade deficit as usual was with japan 
an imbalance of 444 billion down slightly from a march deficit 
of 455 billion 
the trade deficit with western europe continued to decline 
dropping to 8123 million in april the deficit with canada 
americas largest trading partner edged down to 108 billion 
compared to 114 billion in march 
the countrybycountry totals unlike the other figures are not 
adjusted for seasonal variations 
before adjusting for seasonal factors the april trade deficit 
would have been 978 billion 11 percent below the seasonally 
adjusted figure of 989 billion

financial markets rallied powerfully tuesday in response to a 
stunning drop in the us monthly trade deficit oil prices rose 
after opec extended a production pact and american automakers 
reported lower sales for early june 
the biggest economic news was the commerce departments report 
that the april trade deficit shrank to 989 billion the best 
showing in more than three years 
many economists had expected a wider deficit assuming exports 
would not not sustain high levels and imports would surge but 
exports declined only slightly and imports plunged dampening fears 
that the economy is growing too rapidly and acute inflation is 
inevitable 
the news was greeted enthusiastically in the dollar bond and 
stock markets the dollar leaped in value against most major 
foreign currencies rising 17 percent against the british pound 
16 percent against the west german mark and 11 percent against 
the japanese yen 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of interest rates the 
key 30year treasury issue jumped more than 20 per 1000 in face 
amount and its yield fell to 881 percent the lowest point in two 
months 
the bond rally spilled into stocks where prices surged and the 
key dow jones industrial average rose 2507 points to 212447 its 
highest close since the october crash broader market barometers 
also hit postcrash highs 
elsewhere oil prices rose after the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries decided to prolong an outputrestraint pact 
until the end of the year 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the us benchmark crude oil rose 40 cents to 
settle at 1683 per 42gallon barrel 
in other economic news major automakers said sales of 
domestically built cars and light trucks fell 41 percent in early 
june from last years levels for the same period 
but industry analysts attributed the decline largely to buying 
incentives last year that inflated sales they said that 1988 
spring sales have held steady and consumer confidence remains 
strong 
car sales were down for all domestic makers except toyota motor 
corp which was just beginning us production last year and 
mazda motor corp which began us production in september

corn futures prices soared the maximum allowed for daily trading 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade as longrange weather 
forecasts fanned fears of drought damage to the us corn crop 
other grain and soybean futures also advanced 
on other markets energy futures posted steep gains treasury 
bond futures and stockindex futures rose sharply livestock and 
meat were lower copper plunged and precious metals rose 
the national weather services forecast for warmer and 
drierthannormal conditions in the midwest through midjuly was 
the main factor driving corn prices higher analysts said 
until this week the dramatic rise in corn futures prices was 
mainly speculative since a soaking rain could have restored almost 
all of the crop to full health 
but the lack of moisture has now begun taking a real toll on the 
corn crop despite scattered showers tuesday in parts of minnesota 
iowa and wisconsin said katharina zimmer a wheat and corn analyst 
with merrill lynch capital markets inc in new york 
everybody knows that this is the week when we start doing 
damage to the corn crops in many important growing areas she 
said this is the week when we really start taking off bushels 
contracts for delivery of corn in july september december and 
march all advanced their daily limit of 10 cents a bushel 
the oat and spring wheat crops have already sustained severe 
drought damage and experts say the soybean crop will suffer if the 
dry spell continues into july 
wheat settled 1 cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 374 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 10 cents 
higher with july at 269 a bushel oats were 2 cents lower to 7 
cents higher with july at 269 a bushel soybeans were unchanged 
to 14 cents higher with july at 890 a bushel 
oil futures surged following reports that opec ministers had 
agreed to extend their existing oil output pact for six months but 
some analysts were at a loss to explain the markets reaction 
futures prices had fallen sharply during the past week in 
anticipation of just such an agreement peter beutel an analyst in 
new york with elders futures inc said he didnt know whether the 
jump in prices signaled a major turnaround in market sentiment or 
was merely an upward blip in a downward trend 
i feel a little like a detective who knows theres a dead body 
here and whos looking for a murder weapon and a motive he said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 38 cents to 42 cents 
higher with july at 1683 cents a barrel heating oil was 55 cent 
to 59 cent higher with july at 4432 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 88 cent to 113 cents higher with july at 4953 cents 
a gallon 
the governments report of an unexpected narrowing of the us 
trade deficit to 989 billion gave treasury bond futures a boost 
on the chicago board of trade 
the dollars stronger showing against other major currencies 
also supported treasury bond futures analysts said 
june treasury bonds settled 1 2932 higher at 90 1632 
stockindex futures markets also registered optimism in the wake 
of the tradedeficit report the contract for june delivery of the 
standard amp poors 500 index on the chicago mercantile exchange 
settled 290 points higher at 27460 
pork futures retreated on the chicago mercantile exchange with 
frozen pork bellies down sharply for the sixth straight day on 
slack retail demand for pork products low cash hog prices and 
concerns about abundant supplies of pork bellies in cold storage 
analysts said 
live cattle futures were mostly lower on weak cash markets a 
sharper drop in feeder cattle futures prices reflected concern 
about the rising cost of feed grains said thomas morgan president 
of sterling research corp of arlington heights ill 
live cattle settled 27 cent lower to 20 cent higher with june 
at 7180 cents a pound feeder cattle were 65 cent to 1 cent lower 
with august at 7327 cents a pound hogs were 105 cents lower to 
43 cent higher with june at 5065 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 1 cent to 188 cents lower with july at 4647 cents a 
pound 
copper futures prices fell steeply on the commodity exchange in 
new york reflecting improved availability of the metal analysts 
said copper for june delivery settled 365 cents lower at 1085 a 
pound 
gold and silver futures posted slight gains in reaction to 
higher grain and energy futures prices 
gold settled 20 cents to 1 higher with august at 45460 a troy 
ounce silver was 06 cent to 15 cents higher with july at 707 a

federal prosecutors are seeking a 
substantial prison sentence for the former head of beechnut 
corp who was convicted of distributing phony apple juice for 
babies according to court papers filed tuesday 
former beechnut chief executive neils hoyvald 54 was found 
guilty in february of 351 counts of violating the food drug and 
cosmetic act each count carries a maximum sentence of three years 
in prison and a 10000 fine 
he and his codefendant john lavery a former beechnut vice 
president are scheduled for sentencing thursday in us district 
court in brooklyn 
the government has urged us district judge thomas platt to 
impose a substantial prison sentence for hoyvald because he has 
not shown remorse and because he allegedly gave false testimony 
according to a response letter from hoyvalds attorney brendan 
sullivan jr who said the arguments had no merit 
assistant us attorney thomas roche said the governments 
presentencing memorandum would not be made public until the day of 
sentencing 
sullivan has asked that hoyvald be spared a prison term and that 
he instead receive probation and community service or home 
detention 
in his presentencing memo sullivan suggested that hoyvald 
could lecture to business students so they could learn from his 
mistakes 
mr hoyvald has been branded as a convicted felon and will 
bear the stigma of his convictions for as long as he lives 
sullivan said in his letter this prosecution has already sent a 
message to the food industry that economic adulteration will not 
be overlooked and may result in criminal liability 
hoyvald and lavery were charged in an indictment that accused 
beechnut of shipping adulterated and misbranded juice made from 
phony concentrate throughout the united states and overseas from 
1978 to 1983 
the juice labeled 100 percent apple juice for babies was 
actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no 
apple juice prosecutors charged there has been no evidence that 
the phony juice caused any health problems 
beechnut the corporation pleaded guilty in november to 215 
counts of violating federal food and drug laws and agreed to pay a 
2 million fine 
lavery who oversaw the upstate manufacturing where the juice 
was made was convicted conspiracy 18 counts of mail fraud and 429 
counts of violating federal food and drug laws 
beechnut based in fort washington pa is a subsidiary of 
nestle sa of switzerland

morton thiokol inc testfired its 
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket tuesday with no apparent 
problems in the secondtolast test before shuttle flights are to 
resume 
all indications are we had an excellent test said royce 
mitchell solid rocket program manager for the national aeronautics 
and space administration everything went smoothly the motor 
performed very very well 
brilliant yellow flame erupted from the 126footlong rocket and 
grayishbrown smoke billowed thousands of feet into the air amid a 
roar that could be heard for miles 
the 122second horizontal test conducted at 1 pm mdt at 
morton thiokols wasatch operations plant west of here was the 
fourth of five tests required to qualify major design features of 
the solid fuel booster before the shuttle program grounded after 
the 1986 challenger disaster can resume 
weve got a lot of work to do said jr thompson director 
of the marshall space flight center in huntsville ala barring 
some surprise i feel very good about an august launch 
allen mcdonald morton thiokol vice president of engineering 
said preliminary data indicated that the motor successfully 
withstood the simulated liftoff and flight stresses 
from all aspects we can say it was a totally successful 
test mcdonald said i hope it looks as good from the inside as 
it does on the outside 
its an extremely good test mitchell said 
he said engineers will spend the next two days studying computer 
readouts of the test and disassembling the motor and officials 
expect to have a complete analysis within two weeks 
fifteen minutes after the test a nozzle exit cone toppled from 
the rear of the motor to simulate its separation from the motor 
during a flight 
nasa has scheduled an aug 31 launch of the shuttle discovery 
the booster tested tuesday was free of planned flaws introduced 
in previous tests to determine whether the joint can withstand the 
intense heat and pressures of launch even in the event of some 
failures morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab said 
it also was the first use of a new 22 million test stand which 
has 1216 channels of instrumentation and uses hydraulic struts to 
duplicate steering flight turbulence and other stresses the motor 
will endure during launch he said 
the building also can heat an entire motor to 110 degrees 
fahrenheit or cool it to 20 degrees the rockets 11 million 
pounds of propellant has been heated to a uniform 90 degrees or 
about 20 degrees warmer than the usual launch temperature to allow 
engineers to test its performance at the upper limit for an actual 
launch raab said 
david ewing deputy director of program management for morton 
thiokol said the hydraulic struts that duplicate launch stresses 
are based on the worstcase sideloads experienced in past 
shuttle flights 
during launch the boosters flex about 26 inches at the tip 
creating a twang he said the test simulated those pressures 
on the rocket motors joints 
the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 was blamed on a 
faulty booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to snake 
through an oring triggering the blast that killed the seven crew 
members 
the new joint incorporates three viton orings instead of two a 
metal lip to help hold the joint together and an adhesively bonded 
relief slot that reduces stresses and increases the sealing action 
of the bonded surface under pressure raab said 
moreover the rockets three field joints are equipped with 
heaters to maintain a minimum temperature of 75 degrees fahrenheit 
subfreezing temperatures the night before the doomed challenger 
launch were found to have contributed to the failure of the joint 
for the experiment simulating the nozzle exit cones separation 
during flight the test device was fitted with an explosive 
severance system activated 15 minutes after the test 
dozens of visitors from chicagobased morton thiokol nasa and 
various subcontractors were at the remote desert plant to watch 
tuesdays test 
the final fullscale test is scheduled for some time in july at 
that time severe flaws will be introduced in the joints to test 
the system to its limits raab said 
testing of the redesigned motor has gone so well he said that 
discoverys two boosters were hooked up friday with an external 
fuel tank at cape canaveral fla and the stack was to be joined 
with the shuttle thursday

a lawsuit filed tuesday accused suzuki 
motors co of violating federal racketeering laws by fraudulently 
promoting its sporty samurai vehicles as safe 
the classaction suit alleged suzuki and the firms handling the 
companys public relations and advertising routinely committed mail 
and wire fraud and conspiracy to conceal the samurais dangers 
violating the federal racketeering influenced corrupt 
organizations act 
the suit filed by dr harold kay of wynnewood pa on behalf 
of all samurai owners not employed by suzuki seeks unspecified 
punitive and compensatory damages from the defendants 
suzuki has been defending itself vehemently against a call by 
consumers union publisher of consumer reports magazine for a ban 
of the vehicles on the grounds that they tend to roll over in 
sudden turns 
the suit filed in us district court contended the defendants 
were aware the vehicles were not safe but instead were by design 
and construction dangerous and unsuitable for on or offroad use 
and that advertising and other sales representations were false and 
misleading 
laura segall a spokeswoman for suzuki and an employee of the 
defendant public relations firm rogers and associates would not 
comment on the suit because she had not seen it 
the bottom line weve said for the last 10 days is that its 
safe and stable ms segall said tuesday 
consumers union said june 2 that the 8500 samurai was the 
first car out of 349 it had tested in the last decade to roll over 
during a routine accidentavoidance test in which cars swerve to 
avoid a road obstacle 
suzuki said 300pound outriggers attached to the trucks to 
prevent them from rolling over completely during the tests had 
contributed to the results the company also partially blamed the 
drivers actions for causing the vehicle to tip up on two wheels 
during the test

the ruling liberal democratic party approved a 
blueprint for sweeping reform of the national tax system on 
tuesday and pegged a controversial consumer sales tax at 3 
percent party officials said 
the ldps tax system research council completed the final plan 
that could pave the way for the first major overhaul of japans 
postwar tax system 
the ldp draft includes some 448 billion in tax cuts corporate 
and personal income tax rates as well as inheritance levies will be 
cut in the new tax plan which ldp officials say they hope to 
implement by april 1989 
it took six months for us only to agree on the sales tax 
rate said sadanori yamanaka the legislator who heads the 
council now the party must be firmly united under the new plan 
to overcome the opposition parties attempt to block the bill 
the new tax plan caps long and fiercelydebated sessions 
regarding the amount of tax reductions and the level of sales taxes 
among ruling party members and finance ministry officials 
but it also is expected to come under hot debate from opposition 
parties in the upcoming session of the diet the japanese 
parliament 
the new plan finalized tuesday marks the third attempt by the 
government and ruling party to introduce an indirect tax following 
others in 1979 and 1987 
last year thenprime minister yasuhiro nakasone suffered a 
serious political setback when his party was defeated in local 
elections over the sales tax issue 
shintaro abe ldp secretary general said after unveiling the 
new tax plan that the party still faced the task of garnering wide 
support for the reform package 
we have just completed the first stage he said the next 
steps are going to be the real challenge but i think there is a 
consensus within the party 
opposition party leaders denounced the ruling partys decision 
to push forward with the oncedefeated tax reform plan 
it is a serious challenge to the people of our country said 
shizuo yamaguchi secretary general of the japan socialist party 
the largest opposition party the ldp must dissolve the diet and 
let the people decide on the issue 
satsuki eda chairman of the social democratic alliance said 
i am determined to cooperate with other opposition parties to 
block the passage of the new tax law in the diet by all means 
the finance ministry which had sought a 5 percent sales tax 
also welcomed the new tax system as a boost to the domestic economy 
the new tax system is expected to lift the gross national 
product by 01 percent said a finance ministry official as a 
result the japanese economy will be vitalized and expanded 
domestic demand will draw more imports 
finance ministry officials have argued that revenue from a 3 
percent sales tax would total only about 40 billion to 43 
billion short of the amount slated in tax cuts 
the ministry has said it hopes to eliminate budget 
deficitcovering bond issues by fiscal 1990 but may have to revise 
its target if the new ldp plan is passed 
an ldp official said the tax plan will be presented to the diet 
in july for passage by next fall
