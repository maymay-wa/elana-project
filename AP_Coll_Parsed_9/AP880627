nicaraguas rebels on monday rejected 
a proposal by the leftist sandinista government to meet in miami to 
resume stalled peace talks but said they would maintain a 
ceasefire indefinitely 
the ussupported rebels called contras proposed that future 
peace talks be held outside nicaragua and that president daniel 
ortega head the government delegation 
a statement issued in miami by the directorate of the nicaraguan 
resistance the contra umbrella group said the rebels set no 
deadline for ending the ceasefire and charged the sandinista 
regime is the one that has signaled a deadline 
a truce that went into effect on march 21 and expired at the end 
of may was unilateraly extended for 30 days by the sandinistas 
that extension puts the truce deadline at june 30 
peace talks between the government and the rebels reached an 
impasse this month over differences on democratic reforms and a 
timetable for the rebels to lay down their weapons 
the last round of negotiations broke off without agreement on 
june 9 
the government proposed that a new round be held this week in 
managua the contras refused saying the capital didnt have a 
favorable atmosphere for negotiations because the government 
wanted to put too many restrictions on rebel negotiators 
the government then suggested a preparatory meeting be held 
tuesday and wednesday in miami to discuss the agenda for the next 
highlevel negotiating session 
the rebel letter issued monday was signed by directorate member 
roberto ferrey and directed to defense minister humberto ortega 
the presidents brother who headed the government team in previous 
negotiating sessions 
a new highlevel meeting should take place to overcome the 
evident lack of political will of the sandinista government in 
complying with a central american peace plan signed by the 
regions five presidents last august the statement said 
that plan authored by costa ricas president oscar arnulfo 
arias called for negotiations aimed at ending civil wars in 
nicaragua el salvador and guatemala arias won the nobel peace 
prize last year for sponsoring the plan 
the contra letter also said any new round of talks would have to 
take place in another central american country and called on 
president ortega to head the government negotiating team 
it said any agreement reached would have to be guaranteed by the 
presidents of el salvador guatemala honduras and costa rica 
the letter to gen ortega said the meeting could not take place 
in nicaragua because of threats even those you have made 
personally and insults made in the sandinista communications media 
against the nicaraguan resistance delegation 
president ortega said in havana cuba on monday that his 
government will keep searching for a negotiated solution to the 
conflict that the united states has imposed upon us he is in 
cuba on a state visit

the marks of battle cover trees and 
telephone poles in this small town signs of cows with prison 
stripes on them stickers that say only never 
its all part of new braintrees fiveyear fight to keep a 
mediumsecurity state prison from being located among its dairy 
farms a fight that now includes a federal investigation of how the 
administration of gov michael dukakis chose the site 
in this rural hamlet where the 2000head dairy herd is more 
than double the population the cow dictates the pace of life 
patrons fill the small general store for breakfast after the 
morning milking people avoid the road in front of town hall when 
the cows cross from the fields in midafternoon 
the residents protest which confronted dukakis at a campaign 
stop in iowa last year gained momentum last week with revelations 
of an fbi investigation 
however dukakis the likely democratic presidential nominee is 
not a subject of the investigation the fbi stressed 
there are still some people in town who believe you cant 
fight the state said susan reed coowner of reeds country 
store the only commercial establishment in new braintree about 60 
miles west of boston but were proving them wrong 
the town meeting last month narrowly approved 100000 nearly 
onefifth of the towns annual budget to fight the prison plan 
now its much more of a horse race said dorothea 
thomasvitrac a town selectman and a leader of conserve our small 
town they outweigh us in raw power but we balance them in 
people power i think our horse is a little ahead now 
nearing the fifth year of their fight cost members and 
supporters claim the proposal to transform the former pioneer 
valley academy campus into a 500bed mediumsecurity prison would 
irreversibly alter life in new braintree which has no municipal 
water system and a parttime police chief 
cost relying on donations and profits from from bake sales has 
hired an attorney to seek a court injunction against the prison and 
press for release of all related state documents 
cost has questioned links between the owners of the school site 
and dukakis the state has appraised the 784acre school site at 
87 million although a development firm owned by daniel striar 
and gary jacobson purchased the land from the seventhday adventist 
church for about 3 million in december 1985 jacobson is a boyhood 
friend of dukakis and gave 1000 to his presidential campaign 
dukakis administration officials maintain there are no 
improprieties and claim new braintree would be the most appropriate 
location for a prison in massachusetts which has one of the 
nations most overcrowded penal systems 
but the disclosure of the fbi investigation has elevated hopes 
here that dukakis may abandon the prison plan to avoid campaign 
controversy 
i dont think the governor wants to take this baggage around 
with him on the way to the white house selectman steve cronin 
64 said friday 
its not a political fight said thomasvitrac who followed 
dukakis to a campaign stop in osceola iowa in february 1987 she 
said she also spoke with fbi agents last year and recently sent 
information to the massachusetts republican committee 
its a fight for our way of life said thomasvitrac 44 
who moved here 11 years ago 
new braintree was founded 237 years ago as farm and recreation 
land for the residents of braintree a suburb south of boston 
little has changed 
cows sometimes wander into the schoolyard the treeshaded 
crossroads at the village center is marked only by an old brick 
post office and a congregational church there are no stop lights 
and no pay phones 
town clerk carolyn glidden 54 said the influx of 
nonfarming families has increased new braintrees population from 
about 500 in the 1960s to nearly 800 today 
were still a little farming community but things are slowly 
changing said glidden whose husband dons the police chief 
uniform after finishing his fulltime landscaping job we just 
want this prison thing to end so we can get on with our lives 
its been an education for all of us said thomasvitrac 
before cows and the weather were the hot topics 
cecelia imbier said she recently rejected a 1 million offer for 
part of the family dairy farm which her greatgrandfather started 
more than 150 years ago 
the developers are already speculating that the prison will go 
through said imbier 66 they underestimate us 
dukakis says he is the persistent candidate well we are just 
as persistent we have too much to lose

us and japanese officials acknowledge that 
their latest agreement to increase sales of american consumer 
products in japan is just one step on a long road to more balanced 
trade 
this is just a dent in the trade deficit commerce secretary 
c william verity said after officials from the two countries 
announced the pact over the weekend its going to require we 
make a lot of different dents 
the program is aimed at giving a boost to japanese sales of 
usmade sporting goods and leisure products jewelry furniture 
pet foods and processed foods 
those items accounted for almost 16 billion in american 
exports to japan in 1987 but the us trade deficit last year was 
170 billion and fully 60 billion of that came from an imbalance 
with japan 
us government and business officials have long complained that 
american products are not allowed fair access to japans rapidly 
expanding market 
under the agreement trade officials from both countries will 
help american manufacturers locate potential customers in japan 
verity said he would meet soon with us business executives to 
discuss the program 
japans ministry of international trade and industry will help 
remove obstacles that have hindered us sales in japan the 
officials said 
miti will work with them in opening opportunities to get the 
products on the shelves verity said now he said in 
department stores all products are japanese 
japanese banks and trading companies also will try to spur sales 
of us goods 
verity and japans minister of international trade and industry 
hajime tamura announced the pact at a news conference saturday and 
said they hoped that additional industries would soon be added to 
the initiative verity said officials from the two countries had 
discussed the eventual inclusion of about 20 products including 
medical and computer equipment 
verity and tamura declined to estimate what effect the agreement 
would have on sales of the american products in japan they 
acknowledged however that the initial results would not be 
dramatic 
we dont have flowers immediately when we try to sow the 
seeds tamura said through a translator we have to sow the 
seeds first 
tamura said japans international trade surplus which peaked in 
1986 has been dropping in recent months while domestic demand has 
been growing sharply he said that in the first five months of this 
year us imports to japan increased 43 percent over the same 
period in 1987 
now is the best possible opportunity for market entries he 
said 
us exports to japan last year totaled 204 million in sporting 
goods and leisure products 34 million in furniture 217 million 
in jewelry and 11 billion in processed foods and pet food 
this is the second trade agreement between the united states and 
japan in a week last monday the two countries reached a trade 
pact that would result in large increases in us imports of beef 
and citrus fruits to japan by phasing out or reducing quotas and 
tariffs

the government has agreed not to enforce a law 
due to take effect july 1 banning sexually explicit telephone 
messages until a federal judge reviews a challenge to the statute 
justice department sources say 
the suit filed earlier this month by a california business in 
us district court in los angeles contends that the law has a 
chilling effect on constitutionally protected free speech 
another challenge was filed last thursday in us district court 
in new york on behalf of a group calling itself consenting adults 
telephone rights association 
the government has agreed to give the los angeles court until 
july 25 to decide whether to put the socalled dialaporn law 
on hold pending further hearings said justice department sources 
who spoke on the condition they not be identified 
challenges to the law were expected when president reagan 
signed a massive education measure to which the dialaporn ban had 
been added he noted that current supreme court jurisprudence is 
unfriendly to parts of this bill 
the law applies only to interstate dialaporn calls and those 
in the district of columbia but most dialaporn services use a 
976 prefix and must be reached from a local exchange only in 
california and a few other states can they be reached longdistance 
with an area code 
barry w lynn a lawyer with the american civil liberties union 
says the law would apply only to about 10 percent of the 
dialaporn business but rep thomas j bliley jr rva a prime 
sponsor of the measure says even a limited effect would spur state 
legislatures to pass their own bans 
the law does not distinguish between live and recorded phone 
communications it does not appear to apply to partyline services 
lynn said 
it provides for both criminal and civil prosecution and carries 
penalties of up to 100000 for each day of violation and 
imprisonment of up to six months 
dialaporn is estimated to produce about 54 million a year in 
revenue for providers and phone companies according to the 
information industry bulletin 
the plaintiffs in both suits charge that the law would infringe 
on their first amendment rights 
the los angeles lawsuit filed earlier this month by sable 
communications of california inc claims the law is overly broad 
and vague chills free speech and is not the least restrictive way 
to keep children from reaching these services 
sable communications is an affiliate of new yorkbased carlin 
communications inc one of the countrys largest dialaporn 
providers 
lawrence abelman the attorney for carlin whose name appears on 
the suit did not return several telephone calls for comment 
carlin several times has challenged federal communications 
commission dialaporn rules requiring providers to restrict access 
to children the sable suit notes that a federal appeals court 
decision in a carlin challenge earlier this year ruled that the 
government could ban obscene but not indecent telephone 
communications 
the fcc applying a supreme court test considers material to be 
obscene if it depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way 
appealing to the prurient interest of an average person and lacking 
serious literary artistic political or scientific value 
the new law bans both obscene and indecent phone messages 
the new york suit seeks to block enforcement of the law against 
live telephone conversations between consenting adults that have 
been paid for in advance by credit card said bruce j ennis jr 
a washington dc attorney who filed the suit 
ennis said the plaintiffs in the action want to remain anonymous 
for reasons of privacy they are listed in the suit as jane roe 
john doe inc and consenting adults telephone rights association 
pressure from antipornography groups and complaints about 
access by children who run up huge bills listening to pornographic 
messages has been reducing the areas in which recorded dialaporn 
services may operate 
bellsouth the regional bell company covering nine southeastern 
states does not allow dialaporn on its network and us west has 
begun to pull the plug on these recorded messages in the 14 states 
it serves 
also many of the pornographic services that used american 
telephone amp telegraph cos paytolisten 900 lines have dropped 
off since the company changed its billing system earlier this year

the remains of 28 american servicemen found 
in canada in november will be returned to this country for burial 
this week 174 years after they were killed while fighting in the 
war of 1812 
the soldiers will be buried thursday with full military honors 
including a 21gun salute us army officials said a plaque also 
will be placed in the cemetery in the town of bath commemorating 
the soldiers deaths in 1814 during the closing days of the niagra 
campaign the discovery of their remains in 1987 and reburial in 
1988 
these boys will be treated as if they died yesterday said 
lt col robert trotter just because were late doesnt mean 
they wont get what they deserve 
the skeletons were unearthed by construction workers digging a 
house foundation in fort erie ontario across the niagara river 
from buffalo 
archaeologists moved the remains to a toronto laboratory where 
most were identified as americans trotter said 
trotter said hundreds of sites were considered for the 
reburials but military records indicated most of the men were from 
central new york where bath is located 
we figure about 90 percent of the men who fought in the 
niagara campaign were from the finger lakes area he said its 
only right that they should be going home 
although individual indentification of the remains could not be 
made ronald williamson a canadian archaeologist who led the 
investigation said the discovery yielded extensive information 
about the war between the americans and the british 
williamson said most the soldiers were in their teens and early 
20s and died horrible deaths 
the philosophy of medicine at the time was to make a complex 
wound simple if you got shot in the hand they cut off your arm 
he said 
williamson said the soldiers probably died during the daily 
assaults by british mercenaries on a us position at snake hill 
the burial ground was a sandy knoll on the shore of lake erie 
each body showed some preparation before burial indicating that 
the survivors were in a rush he said these probably werent 
battlefield deaths but victims of snipers or artillery barrages in 
the weeks after the main battle 
military records indicate that about five men were lost each day 
during the siege on the position 
the campaign ended weeks later when american forces withdrew and 
the burial ground was apparently forgotten

to an uncertain and divided electorate 
michael dukakis is a blank page whose lead over george bush is 
grounded in negative feelings about the republican vice president 
rather than positive attitudes toward the democratic nomineetobe 
according to a survey released today 
the national poll did find democrats remarkably united behind 
dukakis at this point although there are weaknesses in the 
coalition that bush could exploit to build his chances for a fall 
victory 
much of dukakis strength comes from voters worried about the 
course of the nation 
democrats are seen as the party of change bush is not said 
andrew kohut president of the gallup organization which conducted 
the poll for the timesmirror corp 
the survey the latest in a series for the media company is 
based on interviews with 3021 adults in person from may 1322 the 
margin of error was two percentage points 
the horserace numbers for the poll gave dukakis 53 percent of 
the registered voters and bush 40 percent seven percent were 
undecided 
overall dukakis drew a favorable response from 66 percent of 
the sample while 22 percent rated him unfavorably bush got 51 
percent positive marks and 42 percent negative 
but the dukakis numbers are the result of a vague mildly 
positive image the poll analysis said pointing out that 
relatively few voters could rate dukakis on a range of specific 
characteristics only 29 percent said he can get things done 
while 33 percent said he is wellinformed 
bushs image is a bit clearer since he has been on the national 
scene longer but he is stuck with some strong negatives and 
relatively few positives the analysis said 
dukakis is still a blank page to most people kohut said 
adding that neither man has a clearly drawn image 
asked in the poll if they were voting more for their candidate 
or against his opponent bush backers were mostly positive of his 
40 percent support 26 percentage points were based on probush 
sentiments and 11 percent antidukakis three percent were not sure 
but half of dukakis supporters took a negative stance of 
dukakis 53 percent only 22 percentage points were produkakis 26 
percent were antibush and the rest were not sure 
the timesmirror surveys over the past year have divided the 
public into 11 groups based on their values and partisan 
affiliation 
dukakis is doing well in part because he is drawing strong 
support in three of the four usually democratic groups 80 percent 
or better in fact the poll said that democrats are slightly more 
loyal to dukakis at this point than republicans are to bush a 
dramatic change from the high rates of democratic defection in 
recent decades at the presidential level 
bush has solid backing in the two key gop groups 
but the vice president has not won the strong support ronald 
reagan had in a group the poll calls the disaffecteds those 
who are pessimistic and deeply suspicious of both big government 
and big business 
there are however weaknesses in the democratic coalition 
one conservative segment called god and country democrats 
and a swing group called seculars are giving about a quarter 
of their support to bush despite the groups natural democratic 
leanings 
bushs poor showing in the face of the relative economic 
prosperity of the country under a reaganbush administration seems 
to spring from longterm trends worrying the public 
for example 54 percent think they will be personally better off 
next year while only 10 percent say their financial situation will 
deteriorate 
and 24 percent think the national economy will improve in the 
next year while 46 percent believe there will be little change 
twenty percent are pessimistic 
in sharp contrast to such optimism only 41 percent of the 
public was satisfied with the way things are going in the 
country while 54 percent were dissatisfied 
and 37 percent said is likely or certain that the us economy 
could collapse in the next 10 years because of foreign competition 
with such pessimism after seven years of gop control of the 
white house it should not be surprising that the democrats are 
perceived as the party most likely to bring about changes 
fortythree percent of those questioned said the democratic 
party can bring about the kinds of changes the country needs 
with only 27 percent labeling the gop that way nine percent said 
both parties 11 percent said neither and 10 percent were not sure

bob dole couldnt be nicer to george bush 
these days so nice that people are beginning to wonder if the 
kansas senator yearns to be no 2 to the man he once said had 
gotten quite a ways without ever doing much 
the caustic tone of the campaign for the republican presidential 
nomination is gone and dole now proclaims hes ready to hit the 
road to help the vice president in his battle against democrat 
michael dukakis 
were available dole said after bush met with gop senators 
at the capitol recently send us where you want were ready to 
go 
for months dole belittled the vice president as a likely loser 
in november and as someone who could point to nothing he had done 
on his own 
but now the kansas senator directs his fire at dukakis the 
certain democratic presidential nominee and when dole attacks 
dukakis as an outoftouch liberal he often gets a nice 
thankyou note from bush 
the warming in relations between bush and dole prompts 
speculation the senator could end up as the republican vice 
presidential nominee 
but bush on sunday dismissed a report that his aides were 
focusing on dole as the leading candidate for the slot saying 
nobody is authorized to speak in my behalf 
there isnt a long list or a short list bush said 
he clearly is running for vice president lyn nofziger a 
former white house political aide and dole friend said of the 
senator nofziger quickly added that he did not base his view on 
any conversation with the senator 
he certainly isnt lusting after it said sen warren rudman 
of new hampshire who supported dole for the gop presidential 
nomination and remains close to the senator 
rudman said he saw nothing in the shift in doles attitude to 
indicate he was eager to be vice president 
i dont see anything in bobs actions to indicate he is 
pursuing this the vice presidency said rudman its in bob 
doles interest to have george bush win the presidency 
but would dole take second on the ticket 
dole was asked saturday about chances hed be the running mate 
if i got the call id say mr vice president lets talk 
but that hasnt happened dole said 
what he would do if asked the question i just dont know 
said rudman 
i dont have any doubt if hes asked hell take it said 
donald devine a former adviser to the dole presidential campaign 
its george bushs call said walt riker a dole spokesman 
when asked if the senator would accept the vice presidential 
nomination and its a long way between now and new orleans 
the city is the site of the gop convention in august 
riker said that at this point dole would like to be senate 
majority leader again a post he held until republicans lost 
control of the senate in the 1986 election and his title changed to 
minority leader 
opinion polls suggest a bushdole ticket would be a strong 
republican combination 
for example a poll published last month in the charlotte nc 
observer said a bushdole ticket was preferred by north carolina 
voters by 9 points over a democratic ticket of michael dukakis and 
sen sam nunn of georgia 
surveying south carolina voters the same poll found a bushdole 
ticket preferred over dukakis and several different running mates 
including nunn sen albert gore jr of tennessee and jesse jackson 
of course a bushdole ticket will jog memories of all those 
things dole said about the vice president when they were battling 
for votes in iowa and new hampshire and the other republican 
primary and caucus states 
to those who recall dole describing bush as nothing more than 
a resume and a retinue and who remember the senator demanding 
that bush stop lying about my record it would be an 
uncomfortable pairing 
but then bush became ronald reagans running mate after a 
campaign during which he coined the term voodoo economics to 
describe reagans plan to cut taxes increase defense spending and 
balance the budget 
john f kennedy offered lyndon b johnson of texas the second 
spot on the ticket and was described by his brother robert f 
kennedy as stunned when johnson accepted the offer

negotiators report they are making significant 
progress in the effort to expand and strengthen the rules governing 
world trade despite a contentious fight over farm subsidies 
but the reagan administration is concerned that global trade 
talks could be dealt a severe setback if the next president doesnt 
make the negotiations a top priority 
the united states and 95 other countries have been holding talks 
since late 1986 on ways to improve the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade the global compact which governs trade 
these talks were in the headlines last week at the toronto 
economic summit when president reagan repeated his call for a total 
elimination of all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 the 
other nations refused to endorse the idea opting instead for a 
call to reduce subsidies which now annually total 200 billion 
worldwide 
but the worlds largest industrial powers the united states 
japan west germany britain france italy and canada did adopt 
strong language urging their trade ministers to make progress in 
the current global trade talks known as the uruguay round because 
they were launched in that country at a conference in late 1986 
as the uruguay round enters a more difficult phase it is 
vital to ensure the momentum of these ambitious negotiations the 
summit nations declared the greatest possible advance must be 
made in all areas 
negotiators for the biggest trading markets the united states 
japan canada and the 12country european economic community met 
after the toronto summit for an additional two days at a lake 
resort in brainerd minn officials there said they were encouraged 
by progress made in narrowing other differences 
an american official who spoke on condition that his name not 
be used said negotiators were close to reaching agreement on 
tougher rules to protect patents copyrights and trademarks areas 
where international piracy has cost us businesses more than 46 
billion 
the united states is also pushing for rules to govern trade in 
services such as telecommunications and insurance and global 
investment two areas where the united states has a competitive 
edge neither category is now covered by global trading rules 
officials said progress had been made in finding ways to 
increase the free flow of investment between countries but they 
reported less success in trying to write rules governing trade in 
services primarily because of a dispute over just which of 150 
services categories should be covered 
trade officials were more hopeful that a session scheduled for 
montreal in december would bring agreement on ways to strengthen 
the genevabased gatts procedures for settling trade disputes 
between nations by speeding up a process that can now drag on for a 
decade or more 
us officials said they believed a new streamlined dispute 
mechanism would receive approval in montreal and begin operating by 
next year 
likewise us negotiators expressed confidence that reforms in 
the operation of the gatt would also be adopted at least on an 
interim basis the united states is proposing establishment of a 
12 or 14member steering committee representing both industrial 
and third world countries it would set trade policy between the 
meetings of all 96 nations which belong to gatt 
after the minnesota negotiating session us trade 
representative clayton yeutter said he was more hopeful that 
significant progress can be made at the montreal session which is 
coming at the midpoint of the scheduled fouryear uruguay round of 
talks 
we have narrowed the differences and achieved consensus in 
quite a number of areas he said 
but on agriculture us negotiators remained far apart from 
officials of western europe and japan who believe reagans call 
for a total elimination of all subsidies by the end of the century 
is politically unrealistic 
officials of other countries also expressed concern about how 
much authority us negotiators will have in montreal to speak for 
the next administration which will not take office until jan 20 
yeutter said the administration will brief trade advisers for 
the republican and democratic presidential candidates to keep them 
informed on the progress of the negotiations he said he did not 
expect major changes in the us negotiating position regardless of 
who is elected

when lawmakers are asked to identify pratt amp 
whitneys chief lobbyists on capitol hill they quickly rattle off 
the names of jack humphries and mary ellen jones 
but despite their close and frequent contact with legislators 
and top aides the two pratt amp whitney employees are not registered 
as lobbyists with the clerk of the house the company and other 
defense contractors who do not register their legislative liaisons 
say the staffers are not lobbyists but information providers 
the confusion is an illustration of a federal law that critics 
say does not clearly describe what constitutes lobbying or provide 
a mechanism to regulate it effectively 
pratt amp whitney and its parent company united technologies 
corp do not register their legislative liaisons as lobbyists 
because they say the staffers are only providing information to 
congress even though the information is about congressional 
issues that have a direct bearing on the businesses 
our people only visit the hill to provide information said 
utc spokesman james linse hes not saying lowell vote for a 
b and c hes providing information 
the 1946 law describes a lobbyist as a person who is paid for 
the purpose of attempting to influence the passage or defeat of any 
legislation by the congress 
the law is basically loopholeridden said ann mcbride 
senior vice president at common cause which has fought to toughen 
the laws reporting and enforcement requirements it is a law 
that is widely ignored 
mcbride said the lobbying registration issue has been rekindled 
in the wake of the fbis military purchasing investigation which 
involves contractors their washingtonbased officials and their 
private consultants 
the registration statute has virtually no enforcement provisions 
we dont go out and seek lobbyists and determine whether those 
persons do or do not meet the requirements said patricia bias 
director of the house clerks records and registration office if 
someone would complain they would be referred to the justice 
department 
but that rarely if ever happens 
critics say the law needs to be expanded to add an enforcement 
provision and widen the definition of lobbying to include 
information providers such as those from pratt amp whitney 
you present information which is building the case for your 
issue youre not going in there giving information that gives the 
other side of the issue mcbride said it is information used 
to make your best case why an issue should be passed or defeated 
united technologies is not the only major defense contractor 
that does not register its legislative liaisons as lobbyists among 
the nations 10 biggest defense contractors mcdonnell douglas 
corp raytheon corp and martin marietta corp also have no 
employees registered as active lobbyists according to company 
officials and house lobbing records 
we look at this as liaison as opposed to influencing 
legislation said frank tomlinson of mcdonnell douglas 
officials at the four contractors say their legislative liaisons 
respond to congressional requests for information on specific 
programs attend hearings and track legislation the lobbying 
of lawmakers is left to consultants and firms hired by the 
contractors they say 
yet the other major contractors general dynamics corp 
general electric co lockheed corp general motors corp boeing 
co and grumman corp all have similar legislative liaisons who 
are registered as lobbyists in addition to hired lobbyists from 
outside the companies the house records show 
the policy has been if youre going to lobby you register 
said boeing spokesman joe vranich 
registering legislative liaisons has not always been the policy 
even at those companies general dynamics staffers only began 
registering with congress in 1985 
we felt that in order to avoid any question we would go ahead 
and register said general dynamics spokesman al spivak prior 
to that we felt that under the explicit provision of the law it 
wasnt necessary but we decided to avoid any question on the 
matter

an analysis by the agriculture department 
raises questions about waging an export subsidy war with the 
european economic community to force acceptance of us demands for 
phasing out all farm subsidies by the year 2000 
the staff report targeting of us agricultural export 
subsidies used four theoretical cases involving the 
subsidization of wheat and corn exports to selected countries where 
subsidized foreign competition notably the eec has undercut 
us sales 
it concludes that while us farmers would benefit from higher 
export revenues domestic consumers will be hurt 
given the effect of us subsidies on the world wheat and corn 
markets other exporters would not likely remain passive while 
the united states increases its market share at their expense 
all four cases show gains to the subsidy programs in terms of 
net export revenue even if the eec targets its wheat subsidies to 
maximize its export revenue the report said most gains come 
from the subsidization of wheat rather than of corn 
the report added given the objective of export revenue 
maximization the united states does not have the power to coerce 
the eec into a weakened export position also the net annual 
cost to the united states of such a program would be about 1 
billion 
the united states has insisted that agricultural trade barriers 
including direct and nondirect subsidies should be eliminated 
over the next decade or so 
but the eec the main target of such a plan has rebuffed the 
idea as unrealistic and unworkable 
at last weeks round of trade talks in brainerd minn 
involving the united states canada japan and the eec negotiators 
remained far apart on the farm subsidy issue 
even so us trade representative clayton yeutter said the 
united states was not willing to modify its demands and would 
continue to seek the reforms at least for now 
yeutter also said congress might increase us export subsidies 
as it did in 1985 if negotiations stall 
the study was prepared as a theoretical analysis by stephen 
l haley of the departments economic research service who said 
its purpose was to assess us ability to influence world wheat and 
corn markets through an actively supported targeted export 
subsidy program a copy was provided at the request of the 
associated press 
such a program has been in operation for three years as the 
export enhancement program or eep under it exporters are paid 
subsidies or bonuses of surplus governmentowned commodities 
so they can sell wheat corn or other designated products to 
selected foreign countries at reduced prices 
in all four cases the benefits to the wheat and corn 
producing sectors do not outweigh the subsidy costs the report 
said in all four cases losses of 1 billion a year occur in 
national welfare the drive to maximize export revenue is not 
selffinancing 
not only would other countries likely to retaliate large shifts 
in trading patterns might violate restrictions in the 94nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade on inequitable market 
shares the report said 
the united states would be more vulnerable in the world wheat 
market because its world wheat market share is considerably less 
than its corn share the report said 
it added although canada and australia could conceivably 
retaliate for the us program it is the eec judged by its past 
behavior that would be the likely candidate to take retaliatory 
action in the world wheat market 
the reagan administration has been under pressure from some farm 
groups and members of congress to continue the export enhancement 
program at its recent high level even though drought has raised 
uncertainties about us grain production this year 
but agriculture secretary richard e lyng says its too early to 
make a firm commitment on eep because more needs to be known about 
us and world grain supplies for 198889 
but ill tell you this he said last week we will not 
neglect our export trade

vice president george bush says the 
nations prison capacity should be dramatically expanded as part of 
a gettough attitude toward drug dealers 
bush who is slated to get the republican presidential 
nomination this summer also claimed that congress has failed to 
support law enforcement against drugs 
a representative of democrat michael dukakis meanwhile laid 
the blame at the door of bush and the reagan administration 
the opposing assertions by bush and sen dennis deconcini 
dariz were made sunday at a national conference of the fraternal 
order of police 
focusing on what has become a major issue in this years 
presidential campaign bush and deconcini each pointed the finger 
for letting the drug situation escalate out of control 
on the prison issue the single most important thing congress 
could do in the war on drugs is alleviate the shortage of state 
prison space responsible for the premature release of countless 
criminals bush told the audience of about 200 
he said the country is spending anywhere from 2 billion to 5 
billion a year on domestic military bases we dont need any more 
and that those could be converted to minimumsecurity prisons 
he said at a subsequent news conference that he did not have a 
list of bases in mind but that a review of such facilities should 
be conducted and that no state should be exempt 
congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs 
but when it comes to law enforcement some of them go awol bush 
claimed using the military jargon for absent without leave 
he said congress reduced the administrations coast guard budget 
request last year by 72 million and by 864 million over four 
years 
but deconcini said that was just a bogus argument 
he said it was the administration that did the cutting and 
congress that restored drugfighting dollars he said president 
reagans 1988 budget sought a 900 million cut in antidrug funds 
including money for the coast guard and border patrol and a 60 
percent cut in drug prevention and education programs 
deconcini said congress restored 70 percent of the money 
deconcini also attacked bushs performance as head of the 
national narcotics border interdiction system which he said was 
an organization of halfempty offices lacking organization that 
failed in its drugfighting goals 
deconcini said he was addressing the group as a surrogate for 
dukakis who has sewn up the democratic presidential nomination and 
is spending a few days vacationing in nantucket mass 
in his speech bush called for mandatory testing of anyone 
responsible for the public safety recriminalization of drug 
possession in states where it has been decriminalized and the 
death penalty for drug kingpins and those who commit drugrelated 
murders 
he also urged continuation of the zero tolerance policy 
aimed at users of drugs in even small amounts and drug education 
programs for youth and in the work place 
at his news conference bush was asked about a new york times 
report that his aides are focusing on sen bob dole of kansas as 
the leading candidate to become bushs running mate 
nobody is authorized to speak in my behalf bush said 
adding he does not yet have a long list or a short list 
dole while campaigning for bush on saturday in oregon 
indicated the two have not had a discussion about his joining the 
ticket 
in choosing a running mate bush said he would look for a 
philosophical compatibility and a temperamental compatibility

effects of a magnetic storm set off by a major 
solar flare last week and expected to reach earth monday wont be 
nearly as severe as first predicted federal scientists said sunday 
night 
weve dropped our forecast further still said norm cohen of 
the space environment laboratory part of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration based in boulder colo 
initially arrival of the magnetic storm was expected to cause 
major disruptions to electrical transmission and to shortwave and 
other communications including contact between airliners and 
ground controllers and longdistance telephone calls 
cohen said these effects would be either nonexistent or much 
less intense but he said the magnetic storm could still cause 
errors in the orbits of some satellites 
the region on the sun responsible for the very large flaring 
several days ago has decreased in its level of complexity although 
it still retains potential for producing large energetic flares 
cohen said 
noaa officials in boulder on friday predicted the serious storm 
after the largest solar flare in four years exploded on the sun 
an explosive release of hot gas electrically charged particles and 
xrays the original forecast was downgraded saturday and 
downgraded further on sunday

wasp larvae or water bug eggs are fine but 
gene defoliart prefers deepfried greater wax moth larvae which 
taste just like bacon 
insects are as nutritionally valuable as many kinds of meat 
animals said the university of wisconsin entomologist who has 
been promoting bugs as a staple since around 1974 
they are the most protein available to people who dont have 
anything else they also have a good fat vitamin and mineral 
content 
defoliart who snacks on the critters himself once in a while 
finds ways to use them as cheap feed supplements in poor countries 
there are 500 different insect species worldwide eaten by people 
in nearly three dozen asian african and south and central american 
countries he said 
defoliart said he is concerned many people in developing 
countries are being pressured to consume less nutritional 
alternatives to insects because of growing western influence on 
those areas 
its not a goal of ours to get people in the united states to 
eat insects defoliart said but we dont think we should stand 
in the way in places where they are being used 
in mexico a favorite is wasp larvae which taste like almonds 
various ants taste like lemon nuts or cola 
certain types of water bug egg which taste like shrimp are 
harvested for mexican caviar and served in the best restaurants 
another delicacy is escamoles or immature ants 
in 1983 the thai government began urging farmers not to spray 
cropdamaging grasshoppers but catch them defoliart said 
soon after fried grasshoppers became a favorite they hawked 
them in the streets of bangkok and served them in the best 
restaurants said defoliart 
termites are particularly important in some parts of africa 
the termites were talking about are much bigger than the ones you 
see here he said some of these have a wingspan of 4 to 6 
inches 
defoliart is involved in two projects to determine the value and 
feasibility of using insects as feed supplements 
this spring nepalese farmers are harvesting a species of large 
brown cricket for poultry feed in place of imported fish meal an 
expensive item 
in mexico and central america wisconsin researchers are raising 
crickets for poultry swine and pond fish food as well as human 
consumption defoliart said 
similar efforts in the united states involving mormon crickets 
primarily found in the west have had little success 
we have not yet found a feasible way to mass produce them so 
that crickets can compete economically with soybean meal 
defoliart said 
one of his less important pet projects is to someday market 
three types of insect food for human consumption in the united 
states cricket nymphs bee brood which is the pupae stage of the 
drone bee and greater wax moth larvae 
if theyre ever on the market theyll probably be expensive 
it will be a novelty item for a cocktail party he said

women have yet to reach equality with men in 
any country but they come closest in sweden followed by finland 
and then the united states a study by a private population group 
concludes 
at the other end of the scale womens status is lowest in 
povertystricken bangladesh according to the report by the 
independent population crisis committee 
the worlds poorest women are not merely poor they live on 
the edge of subsistence they are economically dependent and 
vulnerable politically and legally powerless said sharon l 
camp vice president of the committee which studies population 
issues 
scoring well in many categories particularly in social equality 
and employment opportunities sweden was ranked first in womens 
status 
finland was listed as no 2 while the united states placed 
third doing particularly well in providing educational 
opportunities for women 
no country managed to be listed as excellent however 
sweden led the very good section and was joined by finland 
the united states east germany norway canada and denmark 
bangladesh finished a distant last with mali afghanistan 
north yemen and pakistan rounding out the bottom five 
the ratings are based on measures of womens status in health 
marriage and children education employment and social equality 
nowhere do women enjoy equal status with men the report said 
but in the least developed countries of africa the middle 
east asia and latin america crushing poverty overlaid with 
longstanding patterns of discrimination create living conditions 
for women almost too harsh to imagine the report said 
women grow half the worlds food but most own no land they are 
onethird of the paid work force but are concentrated in the 
lowestpaid jobs those who have jobs outside the home usually put 
in a double day with household and childcare chores 
here is a rundown of the five areas of womens status and the 
findings of the study

much better at 55 
marriage and children 
this ranking was based on the percent of women who marry while 
still adolescents national fertility rate prevalence of 
contraceptive use and ratio of widows and divorced women heading 
households

percentage of women teachers and differences in literacy rates 
between men and women 
the united states ranked first at 185 points followed by 
jamaica with 18 sweden managed only 155 here 
last was benin at 25 points while north yemen had 3 and nepal 
and libya rated 4 
employment 
the employment category was based on the percentage of women 
working for pay the share who are selfemployed and the number in 
technical and professional occupations 
sweden was tops in womens employment at 145 points followed 
by east germany at 135 and mozambique and the soviet union at 125

political action committees representing six 
of the companies linked to the pentagon purchasing fraud 
investigation have given nearly 3 million to congressional 
candidates in the last three election cycles 
nearly half of this money 47 percent was channeled to 
members of the four military committees in congress according to 
federal election commission reports members of these panels 
received average contributions of 1293 
the reports also show how in some cases the defense 
contractors have been able to legally provide money to lawmakers 
they would not legally be able to give to other government 
officials 
the principal beneficiaries are the lawmakers who make crucial 
decisions about pentagon spending and procurement priorities 
through their memberships on the house and senate armed services 
committees and defense appropriations subcommittees 
last year 37 of the 101 members who serve on the four military 
committees reported receiving about 137100 in speaking fees from 
defense contractors publicly linked to the pentagon probe 
all but 10000 went to the house side of the capitol with 33 
members democrats and republicans alike averaging 3852 each 
in socalled honoraria 
speaking fees are legal on capitol hill but they are forbidden 
by law among executive branch officials senators can pocket up to 
35800 a year in such outside income house members up to 26850 
the associated press surveyed the 1987 financial disclosure 
statements of committee members and campaign contribution reports 
filed with the federal election commission for the 1988 1986 and 
1984 elections 
the reports were filed by political action committees maintained 
by six of the defense contractors who have been searched under 
warrants issued in the massive probe of alleged pentagon 
procurement fraud and bribery 
they are mcdonnell douglas the nations no 1 defense 
contractor litton industries united technologiespratt whitney 
northrop cubic corp and hazeltine corp 
the survey hit only the tip of the iceberg the companies tied 
so far to the probe are part of a huge defense industry with 
dozens of others routinely making campaign contributions and paying 
honoraria to members of congress 
congressional leaders said last week that they had been told by 
the chief prosecutor henry hudson that no lawmakers were targets 
of the 2yearold investigation or had their records seized by the 
fbi 
the destination of the speaking fees often accompanied by free 
trips for lawmakers and their spouses to defense plants and resorts 
tells a lot about where the real power of the pentagon purse lies 
on capitol hill 
twentytwo of the 52 members of house armed services reported 
getting speaking fees from the surveyed defense contractors this 
panel sets broad policy and authorizes items like weapons systems 
but a new tank is worthless unless there is money to build it 
and that money on the house side of the capitol comes from the 
smallest military panel in congress the 11member house defense 
appropriations subcommittee headed by rep william chappell dfla 
last year chappell and eight colleagues on the subcommittee 
reported getting 46250 an average of 5138 apiece from 
contractors tied to the investigation 
chappell may head the committee but he wasnt the favorite 
speaker among the contractors with subpoenaed records that was 
rep john murtha dpa who said he collected 8000 for four 
appearances chappell reported 4000 
others on the subcommittee getting money from the surveyed 
contractors included reps charles wilson dtexas 7000 les 
aucoin dore 6250 bob livingston dla 6000 and bill 
young rfla 6000 
youngs disclosure statement illustrated a practice among 
defense contractors who may fight each other for pentagon jobs but 
can cooperate when it comes to taking a lawmaker on a grand tour 
between jan 12 and jan 16 1987 nine contractors seven of 
them not named in the probe shared the costs of flying housing 
and feeding young for a trip that included visits to facilities in 
california and texas 
for nine speeches in the fiveday stretch young picked up 
13000 in honoraria according to his disclosure statement 
speaking fees are small change for defense contractors compared 
to what they pour into campaign treasuries especially those of 
military committee members 
the biggest spread was in 19834 by northrops pac an average 
of 2014 for members of military committees 876 for nonmembers 
again the defense appropriations subcommittees were favored pac 
targets the average contribution to a lawmaker on these panels was 
1866 
house defense appropriations was allbut blanketed with pac 
money with funds usually going to eight or more of the 11 members 
for the 18member senate counterpart no pac gave to more than 
eight members in the same election cycle 
a pac can give a candidate up to 10000 in each twoyear 
election cycle the survey found three instances northrops pac to 
sen john warner rva in 1984 and united technologiespratt amp 
whitneys pac to warner and sen ted stevens ralaska the same 
year 
military committee members consistently getting 
higherthanaverage pac contributions included sen pete wilson 
rcalif sen alfonse damato rny murtha chappell rep roy 
dyson dmd and rep bill dickinson rala 
two lawmakers on armed services committees sen lawton chiles

duke ellington liked to compose tone poems as 
well as short jazz tunes and the american composers orchestra 
performed four of those longer work at carnegie hall in what was 
billed as the first allellington symphonic concert 
the evening was conducted by maurice peress she worked with 
ellington on several projects including in 1969 making a symphonic 
suite from dukes 1943 black brown and beige 
the symphonic suite includes work song with its crashing 
sounds and optimism come sunday with the melody played by the 
orchestras first cellist then with delicate shading by alto 
saxophonist frank wess and light which has a big finish jon 
faddis trumpet was heard as light really streams in 
the sunday night concert began with les trois rois noirs 
the three black kings which ellington was working on for 
the dance theater of harlem when he died in 1974 his son mercer 
ellington composed it with him and finished it and luther 
henderson orchestrated it for jazz band and orchestra 
king solomon is roiling and majestic the theme for the 
black king of the magi was played in mellow fashion by saxophonist 
jimmy heath the final section eulogized martin luther king and 
included a swinging march 
all four of the evenings tone poems concern black history and 
life all the music combines seriousness dignity the lightening 
of jazz and a very americansounding optimism 
we might have preferred performance by an ensemble with less 
sweetening by a huge string section and more muscle from the 
brass guest musicians who did add fiber were bassist ron carter 
onetime basie band drummer butch miles pianist roy glover and 
saxophonists joe temperley bill easley and walt weiskopf 
sir roland hanna had the pianistic style right for the piano 
concerto new world acomin which ellington composed in 1943 
and revised for his first sacred concert 
harlem commissioned by the nbc symphony in 1950 ended the 
concert ellington undoubtedly had a detailed program in his head 
when he composed harlem and its fun to hear the melodies and 
decide when duke had the populace partying or somebody feeling blue 
after intermission the composers sister ruth ellington 
boatwright presented an original manuscript page of new world 
acomin to betty allen a carnegie hall board member the page 
will hang in the composers gallery of the carnegie hall archives 
miss allen said 
the american composers orchestra which has an annual concert 
series in new york specializes in american symphonic music 
the evening was an event of the jvc jazz festival and the first 
new york international festival of the arts

theres a new gold rush in the 
california desert powered by 1980s technology for coaxing gold out 
of lowgrade ore but miners are worried that plans for a national 
park could someday end the boom 
in the last five years the amount of gold produced in the 
region has soared from 5000 ounces a year to 300000 and the 
industry is now worth 135 million a year according to the us 
bureau of land management 
there are 15 active mines in the area stretching roughly from 
death valley to the mexican border and seven more awaiting 
approval to start operations according to the blm which manages 
much of the region 
what we are doing down here makes the mother lode look like 
small change said peter ertman who oversees mining for the blm 
in imperial county 
the boom is the result of a decadeold runup in gold prices and 
demand combined with largescale use of a gold extraction technique 
called the heapleach method 
lowgrade ore that wouldnt have been worth exploiting with 
older technology is crushed pushed in to heaps hundreds of yards 
long and more than 10 feet tall and then saturated with a solution 
of cyanide and water the cyanide dissolves or leaches out the 
gold and the water is collected at the bottom of the heap for 
treatment to remove its precious cargo 
but prospectors horizons may be shrunk by a proposal to set 
aside vast areas of the desert as a park and wilderness miners 
told us interior secretary donald hodel at a recent meeting at 
gold fields corps mesquite mine 
a proposal to create a new 15millionacre mojave national 
park and confer wilderness status to 45 million more acres of 
desert would drastically limit areas for exploration said richard 
graeme site manager at the imperial county mine 
the proposal introduced in congress by sen alan cranston 
dcalif excludes existing mines from wilderness or park 
protection 
but hodel and others point out that each site contains finite 
amounts of ore and that miners must move on after using it 
i have two kids who want to grow up to be mining engineers 
graeme said i dont want to see anything happen to preclude them 
from making a positive contribution to the economy of the united 
states 
environmentalists worry that the huge heapleach mines endanger 
the water table and wildlife because the cyanidelaced water runs 
through open troughs from the base of the ore piles to huge open 
ponds where it sits awaiting further processing 
complaints have forced a variety of protective measures 
including laying multiple layers of lining beneath leach piles and 
ponds to keep cyanide out of underground water supplies 
the ponds are enclosed by chainlink fences topped with razor 
wire and reinforced with small mesh at the base to keep out animals 
large and small brightlycolored streamers are draped across the 
ponds and compressedair cannons boom at regular intervals to 
scare away birds

jim davidson may call himself a couch 
potato but he spends hours working as the president of naapm the 
national association for the advancement of perry mason 
people are fascinated by mason the defense attorney who won 
countless cases in the old blackandwhite tv series and continues 
racking up victories in occasional specials because they identify 
with his battles against injustice davidson 31 said in a recent 
interview 
the fan club which davidson founded two years ago has 108 
members in 104 states who pay 15 a year ranging from roger 
christman 16 of reading pa to george fister 79 of oakdale 
perry mason stories are always a thrill said fister whose 
collection of the 150 books by perry mason creator erle stanley 
gardner number 300 volumes 
davidsons passion for perry began after he quit work as a jazz 
musician to pursue interest in other things during a 
subsequent career lull he found he couldnt pull himself away from 
tv reruns 
perry mason started out being one of those other things but

its 112 degrees in the shade in 
parts of the mojave desert these days but the political heat is 
rising as folks from here to washington fight over a plan to set 
aside 75 million acres as wilderness 
the battleground is a starkly beautiful land of brushy desert 
and craggy mountains stretching from death valley to the mexican 
border from the snowcapped sierra nevada and coast ranges to the 
sandy borders of nevada and arizona 
the rugged 35000squaremile sweep is home to shy bighorn 
sheep the threatened desert tortoise and a few hardworking cattle 
ranchers it has two existing national parks rich lodes of gold 
and minerals and a sprinkling of fiercely independent communities 
park proponents led by sen alan cranston dcalif the sierra 
club and the wilderness society see the desert as a fragile 
treasure already scarred beyond recovery in some spots by mine 
pits and recreational vehicles 
they would set aside a slice of varied desert terrain bigger 
than the state of delaware as mojave national park 
and they would designate as wilderness areas 80 spots deemed 
ecologically sensitive biologically unique or just beautiful 
including the south algadones dunes the orocopia mountains the 
saline valley and the mecca hills 
even opponents agree the desert deserves special reverence 
its not the dollar value said cattleman dave fisher 
sipping a beer at a barbecue thrown by ranchers worried the bill 
might drastically limit livestock grazing on federal land its 
the greatness of a way of life my god look at that sky look 
across the top of them old pinon trees this is gods country 
leading the fight against the bill is us interior secretary 
donald hodel who toured the region last week 
hodel believes mojave national park would unfairly exclude 
hunters prospectors and explorers he also backs a bureau of land 
management recommendation to limit designated wilderness areas to 
44 covering less than half the area envisioned by cranston 
government land outside park and wilderness should be open to 
multiple use say hodel and the blm meaning vehicles could 
traverse unmaintained roads and tracks and selected mining and 
grazing would be allowed 
i just dont think we have to choose between either preserving 
and protecting on the one hand and natural resources 
transportation corridors and the rest on the other hand hodel 
said we can do both 
park backers nervously monitor the encroachment of civilization 
from los angeles and san diego 
what is the megalopolis of southern california going to need 
in its back yard 100 years from now muses jim dodson sierra 
club desert coordinator and resident of the booming desert suburb 
of lancaster my feeling is if we dont set these areas aside 
right now my grandchildren wont have any opportunities 
the two sides line up like this 
the mojave national park would cover 15 million acres of the 
eastern mojave desert next to the nevada border between interstates 
10 and 40 the blm wants the same land declared a national scenic 
area allowing carefully regulated offroad vehicles cattle 
grazing and other commercial activities that wouldnt be permitted 
in a park 
cranstons proposal dubbed s7 after its senate bill number 
would make 45 million acres of wilderness offlimits for vehicles 
and new mining the blm is proposing 44 wilderness areas totaling 2 
million acres 
death valley national monument would be expanded from 21 
million acres to 34 million acres under s7 and joshua tree 
national monument would grow from 600000 acres to 800000 the blm 
favors less extensive expansions of both parks 
the debate is complex mixing economic and national security 
concerns with the battle over recreation 
one issue is the fate of fourwheeldrive routes the vehicles 
would be limited to established roads in parks and banned from 
wilderness areas 
it would fence out old people young people people with 
physical impairments said carmelita swarts a san diego retiree 
who has roamed the desert by jeep collecting agates jasper and 
petrified wood 
bill backers say proposed wilderness boundaries were carefully 
drawn so that 85 percent of the wilderness would be within 3 miles 
of a road or track that would remain open to vehicles 
the blm estimates that s7 would close 2200 of the 21000 miles 
of unmaintained but passable dirt roads and tracks in the area 
covered by the bill while the sierra club puts the mileage at 
1200 
about 5000 acres would remain open for riding across country 
mining also would be affected new technology that extracts gold 
from lowgrade ore has brought a mineral boom each year about 
135 million in gold is mined in the desert along with other 
minerals that bring the total mining take to 12 billion 
s7 supporters say they drew park and wilderness boundaries to 
leave known mineralrich areas in the clear but mining executives 
worry that wilderness designation which forbids new exploration 
could close off rich areas 
four big military bases in the desert provide troop training and 
testing grounds for planes and missiles 
military brass who limit lowlevel flights over park and 
wilderness areas worry that s7 would hem their bases in with 
wilderness pressuring them to further limit flights 
the sierra clubs dodson a civilian air force employee said 
flight assurances can be written into the law 
the battle appears unlikely to be resolved in the present 
session of congress environmentalists hope the next presidential 
administration will look more favorably on the park

paying the worlds highest prices for fertilizer 
and feed and confined to tiny plots of land japanese farmers are 
in the best of times squeezed to make a profit 
but a new usjapan pact to open up the nations markets to 
cheaper american beef and oranges has sown considerable anxiety 
among farmers 
ikko abe a 57yearold cattle farmer in japans northeastern 
iwate prefecture decided he could no longer cope he hanged 
himself on june 18 just two days before us and japanese 
officials finished the beef and orange agreement 
i oppose the liberalization of beef imports i will protest 
with my death abe wrote in a suicide note 
the japanese government acceded to us demands to gradually 
phase out quotas blocking imports over a threeyear period 
beginning 1991 
farm minister takashi sato signed a similar agreement with 
australian officials in canberra on june 24 
prior to liberalization japan agreed to raise the annual beef 
quota allotment by 60000 tons annually to 394000 tons by fiscal 
1990 afterwards it will be allowed to set tariffs ranging from 50 
to 70 percent for the next three years to soften the impact of 
cheaper beef imports on domestic farmers 
on citrus fruit japan agreed to expand market access for fresh 
oranges by 22000 tons over the coming year to 192000 tons from 
1991 japan will permit unlimited imports of us oranges but 
subject to current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20 
percent off season 
however japans smallscale farmers like abe are plagued by 
mounting overhead costs and diminishing profits they say they 
cannot compete against cheaper american imports because 
productivity is low in this landstarved country where the average 
farm is just three acres 
japan has the lowest selfsufficiency rate of any major 
industrialized nation and is the largest market for us 
agricultural exports 
philip seng asia division head of the us meat export 
federation says japan purchased 85 percent of the 190 million 
pounds of beef and veal exported by the united states last year a 
load that with beef byproducts was worth about 600 million 
imports of american oranges and orange juices totaled almost 
100 million in 1987 according to the us commerce department 
yasuo sasaki a beef farmer from the major beefproducing region 
of iwate laments the advent of a free market system contending 
that his operation will be doomed after the threeyear moratorium 
ends 
he said the government has already forced him to cut rice 
cultivation by 50 percent due to overproduction and declining 
consumption if the beef market is swamped by cheaper imports he 
said farmers will be at a loss to find alternate sources of income 
masahiro shiratsuki who has a herd of 40 steers in japans 
northernmost hokkaido said farmers in his rugged area which is 
not suited to cultivation will be wiped out unless the government 
implements aid measures 
dairy farmers around here cant subsist alone on the sale of 
milk and they depend a great deal on the price of male calves that 
they raise he told the mainichi shimbun a leading japanese 
newspaper 
but when beef is liberalized the price of calves will fall 
demolishing the farmers around here if the government doesnt take 
action 
after concluding the beef and orange pact the japanese 
government announced it would introduce farm emergency measures 
including subsidies to protect producers 
farmers spend about 3200 to buy and raise a steer that they 
can sell for around 4000 when demand is down however prices 
can fall as low as 1600 sasaki and other farmers say 
by comparison imports of us carcasses sell off the dock for 
1150 including freight and a 25 percent tariff according to the 
us meat export federation 
seng told reporters recently that the japanese government is 
forcing farmers to pay two to three times world prices for feed 
grains through import taxes the government says it takes such 
steps to ensure that japan is selfsufficient in food production 
takeo hayashi who grows mandarin oranges in wakayama prefecture 
in southwestern japan says farmers in his sector have seen profits 
decline even under current import restrictions 
orange and orange juice imports almost entirely from the united 
states have cut sharply into domestic production reducing the 
overall cultivation from 370000 acres in 1979 to 260000 acres 
last year 
but critics say japanese consumers should not have to bear the 
burden of farm subsidies and import tariffs that drive up foodstuff 
prices 
domestic beef for example sells for about 360 per 35 
ounces double the price of us imported beef when it is 
available 
moreover while the average farming income of producers has 
declined sharply falling by 71 percent in 1987 to total 7700 
dollars income from nonfarm sources is rising according to the 
agricultural ministry 
the total combined income of the japanese farmer including 
government subsidies averages 56850 per household well above 
the 52800 of citydwellers

by pushing iran out of its last foothold 
in southern iraq the oilrich majnoon islands baghdad has left 
no doubt that it owns the initiative in the persian gulf war 
iraqs recapture of the islands over the weekend marked the 
third time in nine weeks that it employed innovative tactics and a 
newfound aggressive spirit to whip the iranians who appeared to 
have been caught napping 
with a fourth offensive apparently nibbling away at irans last 
brideghead in the northern kurdistan mountains iraqs success in 
driving the iranians off their soil has dramatically changed the 
military balance in the nearly 8yearold war 
the battlefield defeats have intensified iranian disarray amid 
signs of political unrest there 
they have also forced iran to abandon its longheld strategy of 
using a 3to1 edge in manpower to gradually smother iraqs 
superior firepower 
having wrenched the initiative away from the iranians with 
unexpected ease iraq may now be in a position to break the 
stalemate on the battlefield some western military analysts 
believe 
but others say they think iraqs new aggressiveness and irans 
expected retaliation signals another bout of heavy fighting in the 
coming months 
the iraqis drove the iranians out of the faw peninsula on april 
18 ending a twoyear occupation and from a bridgehead around 
salamchech east of the blockaded port city of basra on may 25 
the iranians fought to within 6 miles of basra in early 1987 
suffering huge losses but leaving what was once iraqs second 
largest city dangerously exposed 
tehrans military problems were heightened by its defeat by the 
us navy in the persian gulf on april 18 when six of its naval 
craft were sunk or disabled 
iraqs defense minister gen adnan khairallah boasted that 
saturdays victory at majnoon held by the iranians since 1984 
directly affects the course of the war in a way that will compel 
the iranian enemy to understand the logic of peace 
by keeping up the pressure baghdad clearly hopes to exploit 
political uncertainty in tehran amid growing signs of internal 
opposition to the war due to recent defeats by some western 
estimates more than 500000 iranians have been killed so far 
nevertheless irans hardliners who made sweeping gains in 
recent parliamentary elections appear to hold the upper hand they 
show no sign of backing down from ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
avowed aim of fighting on until iraqi president saddam hussein is 
toppled 
as a revolutionary regime surviving on its ideological 
commitment such a compromise would destroy the governments 
credibility and spark serious political upheavals analyst vahe 
petrossian commented in the middle east economic digest 
some analysts believe recent setbacks have jolted the iranians 
into making a belated attempt to tackle problems of falling morale 
friction between the regular army and the revolutionary guards and 
what appears to be an alarming increase in desertions and 
draftdodging 
irans powerful parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani named 
commanderin chief by khomeini on june 2 in a bid to galvanize the 
military noted june 15 that we are not insisting on getting our 
rights on the battlefield we have defined nonmilitary solutions 
to the war 
but he stressed that he saw little prospect of baghdad conceding 
it started the war and paying billions in reparations thus he 
stressed we are planning to continue the war until victory 
nevertheless iran is having problems mobilizing its people 
this is widely seen as behind its failure to mount a major 
offensive this winter the first time in six years it has not done 
so 
mehdi bazargan the islamic republics first prime minister 
whose freedom movement is the only opposition party allowed to 
function issued a statement earlier this year demanding an end to 
the war and accusing khomeini of erroneous policies 
in the past authorities have ignored bazargans criticisms but 
this time reflecting the unease in tehran revolutionary guards 
seized his headquarters and arrested several of his aides 
bazargan is believed to have evaded the dragnet and gone 
underground

the general accounting office says congress is 
making decisions about the 120 billionayear medicare and 
medicaid programs on the basis of federal research that is often 
delayed or of poor quality 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said the health care 
financing administration was producing reports that were often 
not fully responsive to congressional needs were frequently late 
and were variable in their technical adequacy 
the gao in a report issued sunday attributed some of the 
problems to the lengthy review and revision process conducted by 
administration policy makers both inside and outside the health 
field 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on human resources said the report raises 
serious questions about how important decisions affecting health 
care are made 
if policies are made on the basis of inadequate or misleading 
information or if the information needed is not provided on time 
then we can expect health care to deteriorate weiss who

the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration says increased sunspot activity in the next few 
years could lead to the most intense solar disturbances ever 
recorded 
such intense disturbances can have serious effects including 
interfering with broadcasting damage to sensitive electronic 
systems in satellite and disturbances in electrical power and 
telephone transmissions 
the noaa said sunday they have detected increased sunspot 
activity recently signalling solar activity that some scientists 
have speculated can affect the climate on earth 
changes in rainfall patterns have occurred roughly in parallel 
with changes on the sun over the years however proving that the 
two are connected has so far eluded science 
sunspots occur in cycles of approximately 11 years 
climatologists have found slight variations in rainfall patterns in 
the united states over periods of 11 years in the central and 
western states and over 22 years in the eastern states 
the current cycle began in september 1986 and already has seen 
record rates of increase in sunspots and radiation from the sun

jack montgomery has a bunch of hard workers on 
his northwest georgia farm but they havent done much lately 
except stay home and fan themselves 
its the danged drought the 68yearold beekeeper said 
all the flowers have died north georgias honey production 
should be at its peak right now but its already stopped for the 
year 
so instead of spending these summer days collecting nectar and 
making honey montgomerys bees are trying to beat the heat which 
was expected to reach only the upper 80s today after hovering near 
100 degrees for the past week or so 
the bees actually air condition their hives when it gets this 
hot he said last week they deposit little droplets of water 
along the top of the honey frames and then fan their wings causing 
it to evaporate and cool the hive 
then they move the cool air throughout the hive and take it 
out the door when it starts to heat up they keep repeating the 
process all day long 
montgomery keeps about 15 million bees an italian variety of 
course at his farm south of rome 
he began keeping bees as a hobby 12 years ago shortly after 
getting out of the dairy business he now has 50 hives or 
colonies on his 1400acre farm 
my bees actually like hot dry weather as a rule he said 
the ideal temperature in the hive is about 95 degrees but when 
it gets as hot as its been around here of late the temperature 
will go up to 120 degrees inside the hive if the bees dont turn on 
the air conditioning 
making matters worse is the horrendous lack of rainfall 
montgomery says he knows for a fact that he lives in perhaps the 
hardesthit drought area of the southeast 
weve only gotten 149 inches of rainfall since the first of 
the year said montgomery who has been keeping rainfall records 
for the national weather service for 22 years under normal 
conditions wed have gotten 30 inches of rain by this time of 
year 
i make my observations from the rain gauge i keep out in front 
of the house he said this is the third real bad year in a row 
for us our normal annual rainfall around here is 53 inches but we 
only got 327 inches last year and just 29o inches the year 
before 
he said this translates into bad news for beekeepers as well as 
everybody else 
normally id take about 4000 pounds of honey from my hives 
this summer but i probably wont get half of that last year i 
only got 2000 pounds and only 1000 pounds the year before that 
he says the area is so parched that the few flowers now in bloom 
have ceased producing pollen 
it wouldnt make any difference anyway he added when it 
gets this hot and dry the bees have to spend most of their energy 
trying to stay cool its become a matter of survival now

the league of women voters has started a 
postcardwriting campaign to try to get the 1988 presidential 
candidates to debate under its sponsorship 
two postcards one addressed to republican george bush and one 
to democrat michael dukakis are being sent to league members with 
an accompanying letter from nancy neuman chairwoman of the groups 
education fund 
the shameless attempt by the two parties to steal the 
debates threatens more than the league the letter said it 
threatens the voters 
the group has sponsored presidential debates since 1976 but 
this year has been fighting with the democratic and republican 
parties which are holding their own debates 
dan schnur a bush spokesman said we will wait and see what 
the two parties decide we are not closing any options 
i know we are committed to the democratic national committee 
and republican national committee debates said steve akey a 
dukakis spokesman at this point that is all we have committed 
to

even though polls show most women favoring 
democrat michael dukakis over republican george bush in the 
presidential race former candidate for president shirley chisholm 
says female voters should not be taken for granted 
were not as monolithic as led to believe the former 
brooklyn congresswoman told a national organization for women 
conference this weekend 
you constantly talk about being 53 percent of the vote but if 
you are unable to deliver that you will be ignored she said 
chisholm said there was similar talk of a gender gap in 1984 
when the republican ticket of ronald reagan and george bush handed 
the democratic ticket of walter mondale and geraldine ferraro a 
disastrous defeat 
many women particularly southern women couldnt identify 
with ferraro she said weve got ask why and learn from our 
mistakes 
she warned against singleissue litmus tests such as 
abortion 
you cant use one issue as a litmus test she said you

lt gen henri namphy who reassumed power in haiti 
with a military coup last week says in an interview published 
today that only the army can create the conditions necessary to 
bring democracy to his country 
it would be impossible to organize elections in the current 
circumstances he was quoted as telling the leftist paris daily 
liberation in portauprince the haitian capital on friday 
first of all we have to organize the state and establish the 
basis of this democracy that everyone demands but does not know how 
to prepare for he was quoted as saying 
namphy overthrew the fourmonth civilian administration of 
president leslie manigat and declared himself president of this 
caribbean nation of 6 million the western hemispheres poorest 
country 
the 55yearold military commander presided over the threeman 
junta that ruled haiti for two years after dictator jeanclaude 
duvalier fled in february 1986 
he turned power over in february to manigat who was elected the 
previous month in militaryrun balloting that was rife with fraud 
and boycotted by the four leading presidential candidates and most 
haitians 
only the army of haiti as an institution can bring human 
rights to this country namphy was quoted as saying i am not 
afraid to say it gen namphy is the champion of human rights in 
this country 
on nov 29 independently run nationwide elections were thwarted 
by thugs who massacred civilian voters killing at least 30 
soliders made no attempt to stop the attacks and in some cases

midwestern farmers whose crops are 
threatened by drought rushed to insurance agents this month to buy 
a unique rainguarantee policy but one official says it is more 
like gambling than protection 
agents say farmers will collect if their counties receive less 
than a certain percentage of the normal juneaugust rainfall 
regardless of how the weather affects their crops more rain means 
no payoff 
i guess its like playing a hand of poker youre just 
gambling on the rainfall said farmer john clark of reddick in 
northern illinois if it rains in august and your crops are 
already lost you lose your money but what do you do in a 
situation like this 
clark has about 800 acres of corn that soon will reach the most 
critical stage but without rain there could be substantial losses 
weve never had a year like this in all the years weve 
farmed said clark who began working the land in 1945 
many cornbelt farmers are in the same predicament 
federal crop insurance was available to protect farmers against 
losses from drought and other disasters but university of illinois 
farm management specialist royce hinton says only 13 percent of the 
acres in illinois are covered 
and that insurance must be purchased each year by april 15 the 
drought was not as apparent then as it was when private insurance 
agents began advertising the newer drought insurance in may and 
june 
i received applications for about 7 million in total 
coverage said gert mcginnis of reddick an agent with the 
shaferpearson agency 
she said about 150 farmers rushed into her office before the 
june 17 deadline one applied for 1 million in insurance and paid 
a 20000 premium 
there is real fear and panic said mcginnis one man said 
the money i gave you tonight was as good an investment as i could 
make in las vegas 
her agency advertised that the drought insurance would 
guarantee rain between june 1 and aug 31 
agent earl blair of chatsworth said farmers jammed into his 
office and lined up on the street to buy the policy 
its about the greatest thing there is said blair its 
just like youre house being on fire and well still insure you 
farmers said agents cautioned them that they were merely 
applying for the insurance and that companies could reject their 
requests 
iowabased seed company pioneer international acted as an agent 
for the drought insurance offering policies in iowa indiana ohio 
and wisconsin said spokesman steve daugherty he said other 
companies also offered the insurance in states like illinois 
richard carlson assistant director of the illinois department 
of insurance said the drought insurance was being offered by 
federal insurance co part of the chubb group of insurance 
companies 
weve never approved the form and were not sure its 
insurance said carlson who has asked to see the policy and meet 
with company officials it may be closer to gambling 
mary lu korkuch manager of promotion and public relations for 
the chubb group said company officials would discuss the situation 
with the illinois department but had no immediate response to 
carlsons comments 
carlson said his department could fine the company for selling 
the drought insurance without approval and could order refunds to 
farmers who believed they were misled 
your crops could be dead in the field and the last day of the 
policy it would rain a foot and you would not recover any money 
said beth stuchel of the iowa division of insurance but we have 
no problem with the company or what they are selling as long as the 
farmers understand what they are buying 
the insurance works this way mcginnis explained 
a farmer in kanakee county would pay a premium of 210 an acre 
for a maximum payoff of 100 per acre if the county received no 
more than 30 percent of its normal 90day rainfall of 124 inches 
the more rain the smaller the payoff more than half of normal 
precipitation would mean no money for insured farmers 
premiums for kankakee county were as much as 14 per acre 
depending on the level of coverage

twenty years after antiwar demonstrations 
polarized the nation americans remain deeply divided over whether 
the protests changed society for better or for worse a media 
generalassociated press poll says 
nearly threequarters of those questioned in the national survey 
agreed that the antiwar protests had a lasting effect on society 
and a smaller majority said the movement forged lasting change in 
us foreign policy 
but those who said the protests changed american society were 
split on whether the impact was positive or negative 51 percent 
said positive and 41 percent said negative the rest didnt know 
the division was even more pronounced among those who said the 
protests had a lasting effect on us foreign policy 47 percent 
said the effect was positive and 45 percent said it was negative 
the polls overall margin of error was 3 percentage points 
the movement protesting us involvement in the vietnam war 
reached a crescendo in the summer of 1968 as demonstrators 
occupied college campuses and battled with police during the 
democratic national convention in chicago 
two decades later the media generalap poll found that 
divisions over the protest movement in many cases remain 
for example a majority agreed that the protests influenced us 
policy in vietnam and 59 percent said the effect was to shorten 
the nations involvement in the war but 23 percent said the 
protests prolonged the war 
in another measure the respondents who thought the protests 
influenced vietnam policy were asked if the effect was to prevent 
the united states from winning the war fiftyeight percent said 
no but 30 percent said yes 
more people who identified themselves as conservatives said the 
antiwar protests prevented the united states from winning in 
vietnam similarly conservatives were more likely to say the 
protests had a negative effect on american society and us foreign 
policy 
fiftytwo percent of respondents said society is more liberal 
now than 20 years ago but few said they personally have become 
more liberal a greater share said they are more conservative and 
the greatest share said their views are about the same 
the respondents also subscribed to the view of young people 
today as less activist and more selfinterested than those in 1968 
more than 60 percent agreed with statements that young people 
were more interested in changing society and were more 
idealistic 20 years ago less than a third disagreed 
even more 71 percent agreed that young people are more 
selfish now than they were 20 years ago and just 23 percent 
disagreed smaller majorities said the youth of 1988 are more 
apathetic and at the same time more realistic than were their 
counterparts 20 years ago

for a few days that tried her 
soul kate uhlir left her suburban cleveland routine to witness 
life in a georgia prison and to share what was supposed to be a 
deathrow inmates final hours 
on june 16 freddie davis ms uhlirs longtime pen pal was 
spared from the electric chair at least for 90 days the georgia 
board of pardons and paroles suspended his execution six hours 
before it was to be carried out 
i sort of felt like a soldier on an island with a bow and 
arrow to defend the island and there were tanks coming at me ms 
uhlir recalled 
she was in a waiting area outside the prison with some of davis 
family and friends when the small group of his supporters learned 
his execution had been delayed 
we jumped up and down and screamed ms uhlir said 
finally we burst into tears i put my arms around his 
mother her whole body just shook it was something really 
extraordinary 
the 49yearold office manager and mother of six first wrote 
davis in 1980 after a friend involved in a cincinnatibased program 
called prison pen pals gave her his name and address she said she 
knew nothing about him or his crime 
except for a period in 1986 when ms uhlir was struggling with 
a personal problem she and davis have written each other at least 
once a month 
she learned that davis now 31 was sentenced to die for the 
jan 30 1977 rape and stabbing death of frances rice coe a 
meriwether county ga neighbor of codefendant eddie spraggins 
spraggins also was convicted of murder and sentenced to death 
but won a new trial he was the prime witness against davis during 
his 1977 trial 
however spraggins said in an affidavit recently filed with the 
georgia supreme court that his testimony that davis was in the room 
with mrs coe when she was killed was false 
the affidavit supported ms uhlirs belief that davis is 
innocent developed over her years of correspondence with him 
his letters to ms uhlir gradually became more personal and she 
regularly wrote him about her children in his letters he called 
her sis 
davis had been sentenced to die on christmas eve 1982 but was 
granted a stay of execution 
in his letters he insisted that he killed no one but was 
preparing to die 
after learning that davis had told his attorneys he wanted to 
meet his pen pal ms uhlir traveled to the georgia diagnostic and 
classification center in jackson ga she met davis for the first 
time in the prison june 14 
we held each other right in the hallway she recalled in 
the room there were two plastic molded chairs he said take your 
pick one of the things i remember well is that he was covered 
with sweat but he was wellgroomed and clean he was warm and 
gentlemanly 
he said im not afraid to die but i would like to die the 
way god wants me to die 
he said i didnt kill her katey ive never killed 
anybody i said to him couldnt you have stopped it he just 
said i dont know 
a federal appeals court refused to grant a stay of execution 
before the parole board suspended the sentence 
in its decision the board said it had questions about davis 
culpability spraggins recantation and the new trial granted 
spraggins 
the state board of pardons and paroles will not have an 
opportunity for a full and fair investigation unless the 
execution is suspended said board chairman wayne snow 
i believe that he didnt kill anybody said ms uhlir he 
knew there was still hope even in his letters he never had any 
false fantasies but whats next for him im afraid to say

this community on the banks of the ohio 
river is living up to its name in an unexpected way piles of grain 
valued at almost 1 million are heaped on its streets because of 
droughtstranded barge traffic 
the offandon closure of the river from cairo to about 10 miles 
north of mound city whose top industry is grain storage and 
shipment has made it tough to find empty barges to haul the grain 
and the ones that are available cannot be stocked to capacity 
because the coast guard has placed tonnage limitations on tow sizes 
in hopes of avoiding vessel groundings 
dozens of towboats which need a minimum depth of 9 feet have 
run aground in recent weeks because of fastsinking water levels 
and shoaling a buildup of silt deposits caused by slowflowing 
water 
how do you get the barges in if the rivers close and they 
cant move asked robert hudson of adm growmark in mound city 
you have to bring them in by helicopter 
adm growmark along with two other grain operators here began 
dumping grain on city streets near the river about two weeks ago 
hudson said adm will hold the grain rather than move it by rail to 
save money 
he estimated rail costs at 50 percent more than the highest 
barge freight rates 
since the drought began taking its toll barge operators have 
doubled the average bulk commodity rates to about 14 a ton said 
robert gardner of conti carriers and terminals a unit of 
chicagobased continental grain co the nations fifth largest 
barge company 
i think a lot of people underestimate this industry gardner 
said its resilient and its able to cope with problems of this 
nature were pretty resourceful 
by the middle of last week about 200000 bushels of grain 
created huge mounds in mound city and trucks continued to dump 
more hudson estimated its worth at 700000 
the coast guard said barge traffic along the river where depths 
were only 6 feet in spots remained limited during the weekend 
sand bars some larger than a football field have forced closure 
of the river to allow dredging 
the pileup hudson estimated will cost local grain operators 
about 6000 a month but hudson and other industry officials say 
theyve weathered tough times before 
we take economic chances from time to time said gardner 
we do it with the weather as well all in all he said what 
it does is slow things down a little bit 
hudson noted for example that barges are still loading 
however slowly 
officials call the southern edge of the ohio one of the nations 
most treacherous inland waterways because of its shallow waters 
if a boat runs aground or rams the banks of the narrowing 
channel its barges can break up and float down river possibly 
damaging other vessels 
at midweek hundreds of barges were stranded on the ohio on 
sunday 54 barges were waiting to go downriver the coast guard 
said 
the delay meant up to 10000 a day for each idled towboat 
because of the costs of labor gasoline and lost business 
and chuck shumann a us army corps of engineers spokesman in 
louisville ky warned last week if the drought continues and 
we do not get additional water in the river there will be 
additional dredging in the worst we could have more severe 
problems of boats getting through

the millions of people who live in eastern europe 
could not send delegates to the communist party conference that 
begins tuesday but will certainly be watching it closely 
the kremlin sets the tone for reform in its warsaw pact allies 
and is now increasing pressure on those countries communist 
leaders to follow mikhail s gorbachevs lead 
because the extraordinary 5000delegate conference is not a 
regular party congress east bloc leaders will not get their 
traditional invitation to sit in on the proceedings but they are 
sure to pay close attention 
gorbachevs opening speech is to be carried live by east bloc 
television east europeans will also be tuning in for nightly 
bulletins on the conference or scurrying out in the morning to buy 
soviet dailies that now sell out fast at the news stand 
with moscow now insisting publicly that its allies are free to 
dictate their own reforms at their own pace east bloc officials 
are reluctant to admit openly that the outcome of the soviet party 
conference will have any bearing on their own policies 
but in prague for example officials privately admit they are 
waiting to see whether gorbachev will strengthen his hand 
if the kremlin leader gets a mandate for more radical reform it 
put the heat on czechoslovakias leaders installed after moscow 
crushed gorbachevlike reforms with tanks 20 years ago to allow 
some liberalization 
similar pressure might also arise in bulgaria where the wily 
todor zhivkov 76 has been in power since 1954 and skillfully pays 
lip service to reforms while making changes in the economy that 
have been chaotic 
poland and hungary have gone furthest in matching or even 
exceeding gorbachevs reforms in the economic and political realms 
in budapest officials openly boast now of great support from 
the soviets for their reforms and accordingly have voiced the 
greatest concern that soviet proponents of change are not 
wellplaced to prevail at this weeks conference 
the fact is the supporters of the new line cannot feel that 
their position is safe at the party conference the hungarian 
government daily magyar hirlap wrote last week 
the open or covert opposition the more conservative elements 
of the apparatchiks the bureaucrats and the undecided will make 
their presence felt as they did when the delegates were elected 
the paper said 
in poland the subject of the soviet union and its future comes 
up in almost every conversation about the poles own future 
an opposition platform partially published by the independent 
catholic weekly tygodnik powszechny two weeks ago noted that 
chances for reform can be considered as growing as gorbachevs 
campaign crystalizes and will weaken the position of conservative 
elements among polands ruling communists 
soviet reforms have received scant attention in the official 
media in east germany and romania whose communist leaders so far 
have rejected any need to follow suit 
but east german youth have shouted gorbachev gorbachev when 
protesting police attempts to disperse young rock fans at the 
berlin wall 
romanias 23 million citizens are largely preoccupied in coping 
with severe food shortages but they paid close attention to a 
visit from gorbachev 13 months ago that offered them their only 
chance to date to hear a long televised speech by the soviet 
leader 
all of eastern europes communist leaders many now more 
secretive and orthodox their kremlin counterparts will closely 
follow conference debate over the stalinist past and the need to 
open up communist party life 
as warsaw pact allies embroiled in a fierce dispute over the 
treatment of ethnic hungarians in romania hungary and romania are 
likely to take a special interest in the ethnic unrest that has 
recently flared in the soviet union 
demands will be presented from the three soviet baltic republics 
for more genuine autonomy from moscow the situation in 
nagornokarabakh the armenian enclave in the southern republic of 
azerbaijan that has demanded unification with armenia is also 
likely to be debated 
the soviet union has been at pains not to interfere openly in 
the hungarianromanian dispute 
but any sign that moscow might concede to the baltic demands for 
a greater role for their indigenous languages and culture would 
certainly strengthen the hand of the hungarians who demand an end 
to alleged discrimination against the 17 million ethnic hungarians 
living in romania

the airbus a320 jetliner that crashed in eastern 
france during a demonstration flight had been set aloft with praise 
for its advanced technology but it also flew into an international 
trade dispute 
when the narrowbodied 168passenger airbus a320 went into 
service last month it was touted for its computerized 
flightcontrol system and fuel efficiency 
its maker airbus industrie said it has more than 500 firm 
orders or letters of intent to purchase the a320 which uses 40 
percent less fuel that similar aircraft and is already the fastest 
selling plane in aviation history 
but sundays crash which killed three passengers and injured 
50 raised questions about the twinengine planes safety 
when the plane made its maiden flight for air france over the 
french capital last month thenpremier jacques chirac called it 
the most modern plane in the world 
and airbus industrie a fournation european consortium based in 
toulouse that builds two other planes plans a stretch version of 
the a320 for 1993 as well as a fourengine longrange version 
owned by aerospace companies from britain france west germany 
and spain the company is widely regarded as a triumph of european 
industrial and technical collaboration 
in its 20 years airbus has carved out a substantial share of 
the bigmoney highrisk world commercial airline market dominated 
by us manufacturers such as boeing and mcdonnell douglas 
airbus planes are in service with 61 airlines around the world 
but they planes have kicked up a transatlantic storm over us 
complaints of government subsidies for airbus in april us trade 
representative clayton yeutter warned the governments of the 
fournation consortium to reduce support for airbus or face a trade 
war 
he accused the four of trying to divert attention from their own 
direct subsidies by criticizing the us defense programs for 
supporting the us airline industry 
the central issue under discussion is subsidies for the 
development of commercial projects not the amount of money 
american taxpayers spend in defense of the free world yeutter 
said 
but airbus industrie countered that us funds are actually 
intended to perpetuate us dominance of the world market for 
civilian aircraft

american medical association delegates today 
gathered to debate proposals for battling aids by testing all 
immigrants and inmates overhauling medicaid and creating a type of 
hospital worker to replace nurses 
the annual policymaking meeting runs through thursday and was 
expected to attract up to 2000 doctors from across the country 
the 420 doctors who are official delegates represent the 
associations estimated 295000 members and act as a legislature 
debating and setting policy for the nations largest organization 
of physicians 
today the delegates were scheduled to debate 101 reports on 
problems including child pornography and the health hazards of 
clove cigarettes and to consider more than 200 resolutions on such 
issues as the health risks of tanning parlors and the need to 
revamp the nations medicare health insurance system for the 
elderly 
other proposals to be considered by the organizations house of 
delegates included banning plastic handguns putting warning labels 
on alcoholic beverages and clarifying the amas stand on mercy 
killing 
we take an open liberal policy on resolutions and will 
consider anything that we feel affects the publics health said 
dr william hotchkiss whose term as ama president is ending 
hotchkiss said before the convention began that he expected the 
aids epidemic and how to combat it would prompt detailed 
discussion 
aids of course is the biggest threatening health problem in 
the united states there is still considerable debate that i think 
will take place over the issue of testing said hotchkiss a 
thoracic surgeon from chesapeake va 
one resolution up for debate today recommends requiring state 
and local health departments to notify the sexual partners of 
anyone who tests positive for exposure to the aids virus the 
proposal also calls on the ama to recommend that all immigrants and 
prison inmates be tested for exposure to the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the ama board of trustees also is proposing a massive overhaul 
of medicaid the nations program for helping the poor pay for 
medical care 
a report for the convention says the medicaid program is marred 
by severe inequities nationwide and is in desperate need of 
reform 
it proposes extending benefits to an additional 27 million 
people and raising the annual cost of medicaid by about 24 billion 
a battle may erupt over the amas proposal to help offset the 
nationwide shortage of nurses by creating a new class of hospital 
workers to provide some bedside care to patients 
the american nurses association opposes the plan to create 
licensed registered care technologists under the plan high 
school graduates could begin caring for patients as assistant 
technologists with two months training

car was stoned and set ablaze in the nearby beit lahiya 
neighborhood on sunday israel radio reported 
on sunday a fire damaged the hassan bek mosque in the seaside 
port of jaffa near tel aviv

seeking revenge for fires that have razed more than 35000 acres of 
trees and farmland in israel since may palestinian arsonists are 
suspected in those fires

gasoline prices bucked a summer trend and 
dipped a quarter of a cent a gallon during the last two weeks 
according to a nationwide survey of more than 12000 stations 
the lundberg survey said the average price of all grades of 
gasoline offered at all types of service stations was 9998 cents 
as of friday down from the june 10 average price of 10023 per 
gallon 
the average price was down nearly a full cent from comparable 
june 1987 prices according to the survey released sunday 
it is untypical for retail prices to be falling at this time 
of year when the demand from vacationing motorists usually pulls 
up the price said survey director trilby lundberg 
she blamed the dip on competition between dealers and price 
instablity on the global oil market 
the survey found that average prices at selfserve pumps as of 
friday were regular unleaded 9084 cents a gallon premium 
unleaded 1056 a gallon and regular leaded 8809 cents a 
gallon selfservice pumps account for eight of every 10 gallons of 
gasoline sold 
at full service pumps the average prices were regular 
unleaded 11964 premium unleaded 12978 and regular leaded

after a month of speeches and debate on 
disarmament un delegates were unable to agree on the future 
direction of arms control and adjourned their special general 
assembly session in failure 
many of the 135 speakers at the session hailed the recent 
ussoviet treaty to scrap all intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles yet they were unable to emulate the superpowers and 
overcome national policy differences 
different nations and regional groups held a variety of 
conflicting views but the crucial rift developed between sweeping 
proposals advanced by the soviet union and developing nations and a 
more cautious approach backed by the united states and some of its 
western allies 
delegates clashed in debate over issues such as the us 
spacebased missile defense system known as star wars un 
monitoring of landbased weapons and disarmament and a soviet call 
for a joint ussoviet nuclear test ban 
by sunday morning they gave up the attempt to write a mutually 
acceptable document no vote was attempted on the final resolution 
the 159member general assembly has no enforcement power over 
its decisions but delegates believed a final resolution adopted by 
consensus would carry moral authority by expressing the will of 
the world community 
chinese delegate yu mengyia seemed to blame the united states 
when he said a certain country which should have important 
disarmament responsibilities had insisted on its position that was 
a major reason that consensus was not achieved 
speaking for the soviet union vladimir f petrovsky said only 
that no consensus was possible because of the actions of some 
states 
us delegate max friedersdorf said his country regretted very 
much that it had not been possible to achieve consensus on the 
chairmans draft document which had been acceptable in large part 
to most delegations 
the delegates attempted to rewrite the final document 
unanimously approved at the first special general assembly session 
on disarmament 10 years ago a utopian resolution that many nations 
consider an important outline of the goal of a weaponsfree world 
an attempt to revise the document at the second special session 
on disarmament in 1982 ended in disagreement 
american and some other western allies indicated during the 
latest session that they would reject any document that did not 
address basic concerns of the west including 
spiraling military spending by developing nations western 
delegates said those funds would be better spent on economic 
development education and health care 
the emergence of regional powers as major factors in 
militarization and instability such as iran and iraq and india 
and pakistan virtually all wars since world war ii have been 
fought among developing nations 
recognizing that the united states and the soviet union have 
made progress on disarmament and stating that such treaties are a 
strictly bilateral matter as us secretary of shultz george 
shultz told the special session 
in addition the united states favored emphasis on conventional 
disarmament especially in europe where the warsaw pact is regarded 
as stronger than nato in such forces 
in his speech to the session soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze called for elimination of all nuclear weapons by the 
end of the century troop reductions of 500000 soldiers each by 
the warsaw pact and nato and a joint ussoviet nuclear test ban 
the soviets and the developing nations also favored an expanded 
role for the united nations in arms control monitoring and an 
international naval force under un control which the united 
states opposes 
nonaligned nations further wanted to identify israel and south 
africa as regional offenders in the final document another bone of 
contention with the west 
the special session cost the financially ailing world body 74 
million

pope john paul ii today denounced 
bitter confrontations among roman catholics as a historic 
schism loomed between the church and its traditionalists 
the churchs first break in more than a century could open if 
traditionalist french archbishop marcel lefebvre goes ahead with 
the consecration of four bishops in switzerland over the vaticans 
objections 
the action threatened for thursday would mean automatic 
excommunication for lefebvre under roman catholic law 
also today the pope who was finishing his fiveday tour of 
austria issued special greetings to controversial president kurt 
waldheim 
the president has been accused of complicity in nazi atrocities 
during world war ii but denies any wrongdoing the pope has met 
with waldheim during the visit which has focused heavily on the 
horror of the nazi era 
speaking today to a crowd of 38000 many clad in traditional 
mountain peasant outfits john paul cited growing lack of 
communications among generations numerous divorces suicides 
including those among young people allout fights among 
politicians and parties bitter confrontation among christians 
themselves cynical criticism of the church even in the churchs 
own publications 
these are all warning signs that gods command and the joyful 
message of christ for many are no longer the basis of their 
behavior the pontiff added 
after his return to rome today the pontiff is expected to make 
another attempt to head off what would be the churchs first schism 
since 1870 
lefebvre has announced his intention to consecrate four bishops 
in econe switzerland on thursday in defiance of the vatican 
a lot of people believe in tradition but not in rupture 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro told reporters in salzburg on 
sunday 
navarro said the vatican has received indications that only 
about 20 percent of lefebvres followers would remain loyal to the 
82yearold prelate should he defy the pope 
the vatican spokesman estimated that lefebvre has between 80000 
and 100000 followers but other vatican officials say as many as 
half a million catholics around the world turn to tradionalist 
priests for various church functions 
earlier the vaticans no 2 official secretary of state 
cardinal agostino casaroli called the impending schism a painful 
wound and a break that could not be immediately repairable 
i am certain he will not have a large following and that 
people will understand the pope has done all he could to avoid 
it the italian prelate told reporters 
also sunday conservative austrian bishop kurt krenn said an 
official of lefebvres pius x fraternity had given him a message 
saying in essence we dont want a schism and hope that a 
peaceful solution can be found 
krenn said he relayed the message to the pope through a vatican 
intermediary 
a compromise solution reached by the two sides last month fell 
apart and lefebvre said he intended to go ahead and consecrate the 
four bishops a swiss a frenchman an argentine and an american 
the pius x fraternity headquartered in econe claims to have 
250 priests and 280 seminarians 
the traditionalists reject many of the reforms approved by the 
second vatican council of 196265 and celebrate the tridentine 
latin mass for which special vatican approval is required 
the last schism in the church involved the socalled old 
catholics who broke with the vatican in 1870 after the first 
vatican council proclaimed the infallibility of the pope 
waldheim was in the audience at innsbrucks bergisel stadium for 
this mornings mass during which the pope said i greet the 
esteemed representatives from the civil and governmental area 
especially among them the federal president and the two state 
governors from the western part of austria 
as the pope cited waldheim the crowd broke into applause while 
austrian television focused on the president and his wife 
elisabeth 
waldheim was scheduled to wish the pontiff farewell at the end 
of the trip tonight at innsbruck airport 
john paul angered some jewish leaders by meeting with waldheim 
at the start of his trip thursday

profittaking 
gold prices were slightly lower in quiet trading 
despite the dollars slight retreat at midmorning dealers 
predicted it would continue to rise 
theres been a complete reversal in trend against the 
dollar said one trader with a major italian commercial bank 
traders said the absence of central bank intervention in the 
market and heavy demand for dollars by japanese financial 
institutions had sparked the dollars sudden advance 
a trader at a us bank in frankfurt said leaders of the seven 
major industrialized nations attending last weeks economic summit 
in toronto probably agreed to do nothing or let the dollar drift 
up 
the only thing that will stop the dollar from going up at the 
moment is a central bank intervention said another trader and 
even then only intervention by the us federal reserve would be 
taken as a serious signal that the dollar shouldnt climb higher 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 200 yen to a closing 13170 later in

syrianallied palestinian dissidents 
backed by a fierce artillery barrage today overran a beirut refugee 
camp and trapped yasser arafat loyalists in their final local 
pocket of resistance 
police said 40 fighters loyal to the palestine liberation 
organization chief surrendered up to 160 others remained pinned 
down awaiting possible safe passage out of the chatilla camp 
seven people were killed and 11 wounded in the latest 
hostilities between fighters of col saeed mousas breakaway 
fatahuprising and arafats mainstream fatah faction in chatilla 
and the nearby bourj elbarajneh refugee camp 
a palestinian official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the dissidents seized control of chatilla this morning after 
they leveled what was left of the nearly halfmile square 
shantytown in a sustained barrage of 25 shells a minute 
black smoke billowed from the two camps as the fighting raged 
through the morning with the boom of shell blasts shaking the 
lebanese capital 
you have a last chance to surrender and turn yourselves in to 
the syrian army or face a final onslaught the dissident command 
said in a statement communicated to the encircled loyalists no 
deadline was set 
fatah admitted that the dissidents had stormed chatilla and 
captured two of four bases seized by arafats men a month ago 
the 40 who surrendered left with their hands clasped behind 
their heads syrian army officers and libyan mediators took charge 
of them police said 
the remaining loyalists stopped firing but remained in their 
position waiting for syrian and libyan mediators to arrange safe 
conduct 
the 40 guerrillas and others still trapped inside chatilla would 
probably be sent to the ein elhilweh refugee camp on the outskirts 
of southern lebanons port city of sidon palestinian and lebanese 
police sources said 
that camp is controlled by mainstream plo guerrillas 
in all 127 people have been killed and 527 wounded since may 1 
when the rival factions began fighting for control of the two camps 
on beiruts southern outskirts 
a plo official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
abdulamir abbas a lebanese mediator planned to enter chatilla 
later today to try to persuade arafats loyalists to lay down arms 
and evacuate the camp 
the official said the loyalists were willing to abandon the camp 
if the syrian army gives them safe conduct to refugee camps in 
south lebanon 
syria has thousands of troops enforcing security in west and 
south beirut but the soldiers who ring chatilla and bourj 
elbarajneh have made no move to stop the palestinian factional 
fighting 
the battles flared despite a reconciliation between arafat and 
syrian president hafez assad in april after a fiveyear feud over 
control of the palestinian movement

bail 
shrubsall beat his 56yearold mother marianne to death 
saturday morning after an argument over his late return from his 
girlfriends house detective lt richard clute said 
friends and neighbors reacted with disbelief that shrubsall who 
was bound for the university of chicago this fall could have 
committed the crime 
you cant say anything bad about him he was just super 
nice said neighbor darlene irish whenever his mother said 
anything he did it just like that 
he had everything going for him said classmate terry 
adamec he was the smartest guy in the whole school

british airways said today it is satisfied the 
a320 airbus is safe and will return to service the two jets it 
withdrew after the crash of an air france model of the plane on 
sunday 
british airways suspended service of its two a320 jets at 
midnight sunday while waiting for information about the cause of 
the crash near the swissfrench border which killed three people 
following discussions with airbus industrie the planes 
manufacturer and britains civil aviation authority british 
airways said it will on tuesday resume its a320 service between 
londons gatwick airport and various european destinations 
we are satisfied with the safety and operating integrity of 
the aircraft said an airline spokesman speaking anonymously in 
keeping with british custom 
michael hennell a professor of computational mathematics at 
liverpool university said he has been warning authorities since 
last year about flaws in the a320 the first civilian airliner with 
a fully computerized flightcontrol system that performs many tasks 
previously done by pilots 
the system replaces the pilots control stick with a series of 
computers and miles of electronic cables instead of the pilot 
physically moving the stick to adjust the aircrafts flaps for 
example computers are used to send an electronic signal to the 
flaps 
airbus industrie maintains the system permits safer 
electronically controlled flight but hennell said it does not 
always allow the pilot to override the computer airbus is a 
fournation consortium in which britain has a large stake 
the pilot has very little last say hennell said it is 
the computer that really determines what is to happen and that is 
to avoid pilot error 
computers control almost every aspect of this aircraft it is 
very hard to see what could have happened that couldnt be laid at 
the door of one of the computers 
hennell has campaigned before britains civil aviation authority 
against licensing the a320 
hennell said in a british broadcasting corp tv interview the 
basic problem as i see it is that we dont have the technology to 
ensure that the computer programs are anything like correct the 
technology of writing programs and designing computers of this 
complexity just is not adequate for this sort of task 
but capt paul wilson of the guild of air pilots told the bbc 
i dont believe the computer system is responsible for this 
accident

party of six skiers including the prince did collectively cause 
the avalanche above the klosters resort

the group had assumed a collective risk that excluded any one 
member from personal responsibility for the accident

party on the excursion acted in conformity with his duties they 
said 
the 39yearold prince and three other group members including

jesse jackson said today he will bring platform 
differences with michael dukakis to the convention floor but 
signalled strong willingness to compromise and find common 
ground with the democrats certain presidential nominee 
jacksons conciliatory tone came after the dukakis forces 
prevailed at a weekend party meeting on the platform in keeping the 
partys statement on issues broad on principles and short on 
specifics 
jackson interviewed today from chicago on abctvs good 
morning america said he is meeting with campaign aides today to 
discuss what issues his more than 1100 delegates will press for at 
the convention next month in atlanta 
in some measure our mission is to find common ground in the 
committee structure jackson said where that cannot take 
place well take it to the floor and simply let the people air it 
out in the public thats healthy for our party better we be on 
the floor debating than outside dividing in this context he said 
also today rep william gray iii of pennsylvania a jackson 
supporter who chaired the platform committee meeting said 
jacksons forces had an impact even if they didnt carry several 
key issues votes 
i think there are a lot of things in this platform that are 
the result of jesse jacksons leadership in the debate in 1988 in 
the presidential primaries gray interviewed in washington said 
on the cbstv this morning program 
what we were trying to do was pull together all the elements 
of the democratic party and its the result of all those elements 
coming together and stating what are the broad principles gray 
said 
looking ahead to fights over such issues as higher taxes and his 
call for a freeze on military spending jackson said any fight he 
wages over the platform is not to make it just loud for 
excitement but to deal with a direction that will make a 
difference 
both the dukakis and jackson strategists left the democratic 
platform committee meeting boasting of party unity and the common 
ground they reached 
but on key areas where there was no consensus the majority 
dukakis delegates stood their ground and resisted jackson planks a 
jackson budget package combining both his call for higher taxes on 
the wealthy and a pentagon freeze went down 10844 in the only 
standup vote 
all other amendments were handled by voice votes adding to the 
atmosphere of harmony 
in san juan puerto rico jackson told reporters there will 
no doubt be some minority positions taken to the floor but he 
said it was too early to say which issues 
i do not think that bland is beautiful jackson said later 
as he campaigned in st croix in the us virgin islands people 
ought to be specific ought to make promises ought to keep 
promises ought to make commitments people have given us a 
mandate 
the platform committee also rejected jackson amendments seeking 
to double the education budget commit the united states to 
nofirstuse of nuclear weapons and call for palestinian 
selfdetermination 
the platform vows the democrats will restore competence 
caring and incorruptibility to washington and reverse seven 
years of voodoo economics trickle down policies and fiscal 
irresponsibility 
it does not mention taxes or say how the democrats will reduce 
the deficit 
many passages bore the stamp of jackson the document calls for 
an indexed minimum wage terms south africa a terrorist stat slaps 
at corporate raiders and endorses sameday and mailin voter 
registration 
the committee also accepted less controversial jackson 
amendments including calls for third world debt relief and 
significant increases in child care aid for low and middleincome 
families 
about 95 percent of all the issues that came up between these 
two campaigns have been resolved in a peaceful and in a unified 
way and i know that scares the republicans to death former 
gary ind mayor richard hatcher a jackson campaign leader said 
saturday 
paul g kirk jr the party chairman said in a statement from 
washington commonsense politics has given us a short statement 
of principle all democrats can run on in november 
michael barnes who led dukakis platform team said the 
placidity of the platform writing indicates the democratic party 
really has matured and is ready to take the reins of government 
there may be in atlanta some further discussion of these 
issues said barnes a former maryland congressman thats 
normal but im confident that if there is it will be done in the 
same spirit we saw here in denver 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons platform chief said in 
weighing floor fights jackson must decide which issues are 
icing and which are worth risking a divisive debate 
norton a georgetown university law professor said the 
differences between dukakis and jackson have not evaporated but 
the governor and the reverend in these proceedings moved closer 
together 
rep tom bevill dala summed up the reason for vagueness in 
the platform saturday during debate the amendment pledging no first 
use of nuclear weapons 
we have an old saying there on the floor of the house he 
said nobody no member of congress has ever been defeated 
because of something he didnt say

dead in a ditch southeast of san francisco in 1978 the girl 
survived 
he listed his brothers address with authorities when he moved 
to florida after being paroled prompting a local businessman and a 
radio station each to offer singleton 5000 if he will move 
walter singleton says his brother lives about two hours away 
but refuses to say exactly where 
singleton 60 a former merchant seaman who grew up in tampa 
spent eight years in a california prison he completed a yearlong 
probation while living in a mobile home within the gates of san 
quentin prison after attempts to place him in various california 
cities met with protests 
walter singleton said sunday he feared for his wifes and 
daughters safety 
ill be up every night probably sitting outside he said 
i hope the police are out there protecting me 
bomb squad experts were looking for fingerprints and other clues 
on bomb bits picked out of the lawn ms carter said 
our bomb squad has the fragments that are left we think it 
was a homemade device we found pieces of cardboard and duct tape 
were processing them so hopefully well be able to tell something 
from that she said 
said dave stone who lives down the street i just wish theyd 
leave the people alone the mans not there 
if were going to get rid of him we have to do it without 
violence said heitlinger

jesse jackson today urged sure democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis to pick a forwardlooking 
running mate as he still refused to say whether he wants the job 
the fact that were now discussing it even thats about 
expansion and development jackson said today on abctvs good 
morning america program 
jackson who has said he feels he has earned the right to be 
considered for the national ticket based on his secondplace 
showing in the primaries would discuss only his vision for the job 
and not whether he should be the man to fulfill that vision 
right now were in the process i feel very good about 
it he said from his chicago home 
i do know now we must define that job to be a meaningful 
one said jackson i see that job as being the possibility that 
we will structure into our party hope for our youth commitment for 
our farmers and workers and someone who has rapport in the third 
world in other words it must be a forwardlooking constitutional 
position and not a retirement plan or backup plan 
speaking to a convention sunday night of operation push the 
chicagobased civil rights group he founded jackson also took 
apparent swipes at republican george bushs role as vice president 
in the reagan administration 
its not a wimp job although there have been some wimps in 
it he told the hometown crowd 
earlier sunday as he campaigned in the caribbean jackson 
referred repeatedly to the initials that stand for vice president 
vp doesnt mean visions of the past it must mean vitality 
for the present and vitality for the future he said 
jackson wrapping up a trip to puerto rico and the us virgin 
islands on sunday suggested the democratic platform agreed to over 
the weekend does not go far enough 
i do not think that bland is beautiful jackson said 
people ought to be specific ought to make promises ought to 
keep promises ought to make commitments people have given us a 
mandate 
jacksons calls for a defense budget freeze increasing taxes on 
the rich and palestinian selfdetermination were not incorporated 
into the document 
but jackson indicated he will press his views at the convention 
next month in atlanta 
there will no doubt be some minority positions taken to the 
convention floor jackson said but added it was too early to 
say which issues might be contested 
jackson also told a rally in st croix that he was pleased with 
his profound victories in the party rules committee meeting 
over the weekend in washington 
the committee on saturday agreed that the number of super 
delegates should be cut in half in 1992 and to mandate 
proportional representation from primary and caucus votes super 
delegates attend the convention by virtue of their status as party 
or elective officials and are not obligated to vote as their state 
or district did 
jackson had complained that the super delegates and delegates 
were unfairly distributed this year

after three days of wool uniforms and no 
showers thousands of men helping reenact the battle of gettysburg 
have forsaken the life of a civil war soldier to the 20th century 
id like to stay longer but you have to make a living said 
griff king a 35yearold machine operator from weston wva and a 
member of the 2nd virginia regiment 
more than 8000 uniformed men concluded a commemoration of the 
battles 125th anniversary sunday by staging the final charge of 
the wars bloodiest confrontation 
organizers billed the event as the largest civil war reenactment 
ever 
some 140000 people witnessed the reenectment over three days 
said paul baebler a spokesman for napoleonic tactics inc which 
staged the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the 
actual battlefield 
after the last shots were fired participants from north and 
south stood in silence as a bugler played taps and cannons fired 
one after another in a 21gun salute to honor those who died in the 
actual battle 
close to 50000 union and confederate troops were killed or 
wounded at the battle of gettysburg on july 13 1863 when the 
army of the potomac turned back the army of northern virginias 
attempt to invade the north 
a series of cannon blasts by both sides opened the fighting 
sunday then confederates gave out a rebel yell and marched 
shouldertoshoulder 200 yards across and several men deep across a 
field and up a ridge where union troops waited 
major gen george e picketts unsuccessful charge with more 
than 12000 troops against 9000 union soldiers was the 
confederates final offensive push at gettysburg 
if the battle of gettysburg was the turning point of the civil 
war then picketts charge was the turning point of the battle of 
gettysburg said kim holien a historian with the us army 
center of military history 
troops for the north and south traded volley after volley in an 
engagement staged at onethird the original scale of picketts 
charge 
it was a great battle said john mcqueen a 37yearold 
marketing manager from atlanta who fought for the 52nd ohio 
regiment as soldiers for both sides fell around him 
the rifle barrels were getting so hot you couldnt touch 
them he said 
confederate troops fell back after an hour of battle 
five ersatz troops required hospitalization for injuries 
suffered during the three days of soldiering said dr bill 
steinour director of the emergency room at gettysburg hospital 
he said there were two serious leg injuries a skull fracture a 
man suffering chest pain and another with a kidney stone ailment 
all in all we were lucky steinour said 
the weather too held for the event it was hot and dry all 
three days 
mother nature and god were looking out for us ms niero

a leading economic reformer said today that this 
weeks communist party conference will focus on the partys role in 
society and should not be expected to produce economic miracles 
otto latsis deputy chief editor of the monthly kommunist and a 
conference delegate told reporters that the conferences central 
aim is to unite the party behind political reform 
another delegate kommunist editor nail b bikkenin said the 
goal is to develop a political system that would not allow a repeat 
of the tyranny of josef stalin or the stagnation prevalent during 
leonid i brezhnevs rule 
we will reconstruct our political system which is obsolete 
obsolete bikkenin said what we must have is reliable 
political guarantees against a recurrence of what happened in the 
past 
a third delegate pravda editor viktor g afanasyev said 
mikhail s gorbachev would deliver a big and interesting report 
when the conference opens tuesday afanasyev appearing at one of a 
series of news conferences about the meeting gave no details 
weeks of discussion have produced thousands of suggestions for 
change some of them as radical as having the communist party 
general secretary elected directly by nationwide ballot 
proposals have been floated in the press recently and 
unfettered political discussion has occurred 
the economy however has made few visible advances and 
consumer shortages of items such as sugar and cheese have worsened 
in recent weeks 
latsis noted that in an article published today in the communist 
daily pravda in which he called the countrys retail sales system 
disgraceful 
at his news conference latsis said the supply system could be 
improved only by providing economic stimuli and incorporating a 
much greater role for demand and supply in the soviet unions 
centraly planned economy 
but he made clear that such matters wont be decided at the 
party conference which is expected to last at least until july 1 
the central question is the question of how the party should 
change its role in our society latsis said in this area 
there will be decisions 
these are decisions which will change our future but not the 
next day latsis said there is a lot of waiting for a 
miracle 
banners and propaganda posters adorning the capital as the 5000 
delegates arrived over the weekend for the first such gathering 
since 1941 struck a slightly different tone 
new lettering on many banners invoked a revolutionary style of 
writing not seen since the early 1920s when vladimir i lenin had 
just propelled the bolsheviks to power 
latsis remarks reflected an attempt by reformers and officials 
in recent weeks to lower pubic expectations about what the 
conference will produce 
it had once been billed as a forum that would institute radical 
reforms 
latsis said he did not yet know exactly how the conference would 
be run 
a set of proposals known as theses was approved by the partys 
policymaking central committee on may 23 and has since been 
debated intensely in the media and society 
among them is a suggestion to limit all party and state 
officials to a maximum two terms in office with a possible third 
term if the electing party forum agrees

that lost part of its roof last april saying that while the 
manufacturer had suggested a structural maintenance program for 
older planes no one suggested they were unsafe to fly 
boeing co told aloha last november that some of its jets had 
significant corrosion problems and needed major structural 
inspections 
but at no time was it suggested by boeing or any agency that 
alohas four older aircraft presented a safety problem aloha 
president a maurice myers said sunday 
in fact when queried by aloha top management boeing 
specifically declared that the four older planes were safe to 
continue flying while the structural maintenance program was under 
way myers said 
myers was responding to a published report that boeing told 
aloha it needed a new maintenance program five months before part 
of the fuselage of one of its boeing 737s peeled off on april 28 a 
cabin attendant was swept to her death and 61 of the other 94 
people aboard were injured 
the washington post reported sunday that the seattlebased 
aircraft manufacturer advised the airline aloha has a 
highfrequency flight schedule and operates in a highly corrosive 
environment these factors certainly contribute to the corrosion 
and fatigue damage observed on the two airplane surveys 
this as well as the practice of repainting the airplane before 
and during inspections deferring repairs andor making temporary 
instead of terminating permanent repairs contributes to our 
mutual concerns 
the airline was urged to develop a new maintenance program that 
would ensure thorough and frequent inspections as well as 
preventive maintenance on alohas aging planes the post said 
boeing spokesman bill clark confirmed the newspaper report he 
said his company had been communicating with aloha airlines as part 
of an evaluation of its older planes but he declined to comment on 
the results of the evaluation or on boeings recommendations 
meanwhile a new rule is under consideration that would for the 
first time limit the number of flights planes can make in their 
lifetimes according to a report today in the new york times the 
proposal centers on the number of flights that metalfatigue tests 
show a given type of aircraft can safely endure 
work on the rule which began months ago was speeded up after 
the aloha accident the boeing 737 built in 1969 had made 88000 
flights and under the proposed rule it would have been taken out 
of service before the accident

the main owner of the beleaguered seabrook 
nuclear power plant would abandon the unused plant for the right 
price the utilitys president said today 
we dont have any blinders on we are willing to consider 
anything said robert harrison of public service company of new 
hampshire 
harrison said the utility which filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization in january already has held a preliminary meeting 
with state officials about abandoning the plant he refused to 
identify the officials 
i remain convinced that the best outcome from the point of 
view of the customers is to have the plant operate but if things 
happen we public service are not bound inexorably to the 
ultimate operation of seabrook harrison said 
public service is the largest of the plants 12 owners with 36 
percent ownership a division of public service built the plant on 
the atlantic coast in the southeastern corner of new hampshire 
about 40 miles north of boston 
harrison disclosed the abandonment talks to reporters during a 
discussion of the utilitys legal responsibility to maximize the 
value of company assets he was asked if public service would 
consider a deal similar to one tentatively agreed to for the 
shoreham nuclear plant on long island in new york 
long island lighting co has approved an agreement with the 
state of new york under which the completed but unused shoreham 
plant could be torn down if finalized it would be the first time 
in the nation that a completed nuclear power plant was abandoned 
in return long island lighting would continue to operate as a 
privately owned company and get annual rate increases for 10 years 
harrison today declined to speculate about the likelihood that 
seabrook would be scrapped and said he still believes the 54 
billion plant will be licensed completed in 1986 it hasnt 
received a federal operating license 
harrison acknowledged that it is virtually impossible for 
seabrook to be licensed before new presidential and gubernatorial 
administrations take office in january 
likely democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis as 
governor of neighboring massachusetts has been the key to blocking 
a license for seabrook and would presumably continue his 
opposition if he were elected president 
dukakis has refused to submit required emergency plans for six 
massachusetts communities near the plant saying public safety 
could not be assured in case of a major accident 
new hampshire gov john sununu a strong seabrook supporter is 
not seeking reelection 
in the past public service has fought fiercely for the plant 
originally expected to cost less than 1 billion for two reactors 
and scheduled to begin operating in 1979 but harrison said the 
bankruptcy filing changed things 
though we still staunchly support seabrook and want it to 
operate we do not have the same lifeordeath dependency on that 
project he said

the supreme court today loosened the 
requirements for law enforcement agents to first obtain court 
warrants before conducting searches on private property 
the justices split 43 in ruling that evidence initially 
discovered during an unlawful search sometimes may be used at trial 
if the same evidence is rediscovered during a second lawful 
search 
the courts three dissenters said the ruling emasculates the 
warrant clause of the constitutions fourth amendment which 
generally requires police to get a courts permission before 
conducting searches 
in a 1984 decision the court significantly relaxed the search 
warrant requirement 
in that case police had entered a drug suspects apartment 
without first getting a warrant during a brief search they saw 
some drug paraphernalia 
only after the initial warrantless entry did the officers 
obtain a warrant the police did not tell the magistrate who issued 
the warrant about their previous search 
during their second search of the apartment the police found 
illegal drugs 
the supreme court although finding the first search unlawful 
said the drugs confiscated during the second search could be used 
as trial evidence because the search warrant had been issued on 
grounds unrelated to what police saw during the first unlawful 
search 
in that 1984 decision the justices said police would not be 
encouraged to conduct illegal searches because officers who enter 
illegally will recognize that whatever evidence they discover as a 
direct result of the entry may be suppressed as evidence 
in the case decided today fbi agents conducted an april 6 1983 
search of a south boston warehouse without first obtaining a search 
warrant 
the agents saw but did not seize 270 bales of marijuana 
they then got a warrant reentered the warehouse and seized the 
marijuana 
in upholding the use of the seized marijuana as trial evidence 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals noted that the fbi agents did 
not depend on anything seen during their first entry in obtaining 
the search warrant 
but lawyers for two men convicted in connection with the 
marijuana seizure michael f murray and james d carter argued 
that the 1984 rulings language about evidence discovered as a 
direct result of an unlawful entry should control their case 
the two men were sentenced to four years in prison and fined 
15000 each for conspiring to possess marijuana with intent to 
distribute it 
writing for the court today justice antonin scalia said the 
marijuana does not have to be excluded as evidence if the fbi 
agents would have sought a warrant to search the warehouse even if 
they had not entered unlawfully the first time 
the case now returns to a federal trial judge who will have to 
make that determination 
so long as a later lawful seizure is genuinely independent of 
an earlier tainted one there is no reason why the seized 
evidence should not be used at trial scalia said 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white and harry a blackmun 
justices thurgood marshall john paul stevens and sandra day 
oconnor dissented 
in a opinion for the three marshall said when the very law 
enforcement officers who participate in an illegal search 
immediately thereafter obtain a warrant to search the same 
premises i believe the evidence discovered during the initial 
illegal entry must be suppressed from use at trial 
the case is murray vs us 86995 and 861016

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that grants an exemption from state sales taxes to highstakes 
bingo games run by indian tribes 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by oklahoma 
officials seeking to impose the tax on revenue from a bingo game in 
tulsa run by the muscogee creek nation 
the justices in february 1987 ruled in a california case that 
state and local governments may not regulate highstakes bingo 
games and other gambling operations on indian reservations 
and last september the 10th us circuit court of appeals ruled 
that oklahoma could not force the muscogee creek nation to collect 
and remit the states 25 percent sales tax on the tribes bingo 
operations 
the appeals court said the states interest in collecting the 
tax is minimal in this case 
patrons do not travel onto creek lands to play bingo in order 
to avoid sales taxes the appeals court said creek nation 
bingo does not undermine the state economy or tax base the state 
is not losing tax revenues it would otherwise obtain from sales 
made outside of tribal boundaries 
the appeals court also based its ruling in part on the supreme 
courts ruling in the california case which said state and local 
governments have no say over indianrun gambling unless congress 
gives them permission 
the muscogee creek bingo game is conducted in tulsa on a 
100acre area known as the mackey site along the arkansas river 
the 10th circuit court said the land is indian territory in the 
same way any reservation belongs to native americans 
the appeals court also said the fact that the bingo game is 
managed by a nontribal entity indian country usa inc hired 
by the tribe does not alter the exempt status of the gambling 
operation 
forcing the tribe to collect and remit the sales tax would place 
a heavy burden on the indians even if the tax did not affect 
revenue for the creeks the appeals court said 
it added that the tribe would be subject to fines and liens on 
its property if it were held responsible for collecting the tax and 
then failed to do so 
asked for its views the reagan administration urged the court 
to reject oklahomas appeal 
the case is oklahoma tax commission vs muscogee creek nation

food products bearing a hearthealthy stamp 
of approval from the american heart association will begin 
appearing on store shelves within a year the group says 
a system to identify and endorse processed and packaged foods 
that are low in salt cholesterol and fat was approved by the 
association sunday 
the first group of foods to be examined by an independent 
testing laboratory will be margarines cooking oils and salad 
dressings the association does not plan to endorse meats fruits 
and other nonprocessed food items 
the idea is to make it easy for consumers to rapidly identify 
a product that is appropriate for them said dr louis rakita 
vice chairman of a committee that studied the food productapproval 
program for two years 
committee members said dietary control is one of the most 
effective ways to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease since 
1961 the heart association has been recommending a diet low in 
fat salt and cholesterol as a way to help reduce heart disease 
many americans have adopted healthier eating habits and 
dietary improvements recommended by the aha clearly have played a 
part in the welcome decline in heart attack and stroke death rates 
that we have seen in the last two decades said dr ww aston of 
dallas committee chairman 
heart and blood vessel diseases are the nations leading 
killers and took nearly 1 million lives in the united states in 
1985 the most recent year for which statistics are complete the 
heart association said nearly 65 million americans have one or more 
forms of the diseases 
approval of the program came at the annual meeting of the 
associations policymaking delegate assembly 
aston said two independent nationwide surveys of consumers and 
health specialists showed that they wanted more specific 
information about fat and cholesterol levels 
the program will include creation of a consumer health 
information program it will establish a tollfree national 
nutritional telephone hot line staffed by registered dietitians who 
will give information about nutrition and risk factors for heart 
disease to the public and health professionals 
the program also will include media campaigns and a brochure 
listing products that receive the associations stamp of approval

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether military veterans disability benefits indirectly may be 
subjected to a states community property law when they divorce 
the court said it will review a ruling that californias 
required splitting of benefits with exspouses does not violate 
federal law 
gerald and gaye mansell were divorced in 1979 after 25 years of 
marriage part of the divorce settlement not at issue in the case 
entitled each to onehalf of mansells air force retirement pay 
mansell receives about 1200 a month in retirement benefits 
but has waived his entitlement to about 480 a month in additional 
retirement benefits so he can receive veterans administration 
disability benefits instead 
because va disability benefits unlike military retirement pay 
are exempt from taxes such waivers of retirement pay are common 
california courts also ordered that gaye mansell receive half of 
the 480permonth entitlement to retirement pay her exhusband is 
passing up 
mansell sought to modify the settlement in 1983 arguing that 
the states community property law was preempted by federal law 
when it comes to dividing the disability benefits 
congress clearly intended the veterans administration 
disability benefits to remain the separate property of the disabled 
veteran mansell argued in the appeal acted on today 
his argument was rejected by a state trial judge and a state 
appeals court the california supreme court refused to hear his 
appeal last april 29 
at issue is a federal law passed by congress in the wake of a 
1981 supreme court decision that barred state courts from dividing 
military retirement pay it allowed retirement pay to be subjected 
to alimony awards 
mansell contended that the 1981 law did not authorize such state 
court awards based on disability benefits 
asked for its views the reagan administration urged the court 
to review the controversy 
justice department lawyers contended that california courts 
cannot order mansell to pay alimony based on his va disability 
benefits but they said he could be ordered to pay half of his 
retirement pay entitlement which includes the money he is waiving 
each month from other available income 
for example mansell could be forced to pay in alimony some 840 
instead of 600 from the 1200 in retirement pay he receives each 
month the government lawyers said 
the case is mansell vs forbes 87201

democrat michael dukakis wrapping up a 
fourday island vacation today will travel to washington on 
wednesday to discuss with senate democrats his selection of a vice 
presidential candidate and other issues 
dukakis press secretary mark gearan said the massachusetts 
governor had decided to delay by one day a scheduled campaign trip 
through the midwest in order to spend wednesday in private meetings 
on capitol hill 
the meetings were announced as the dukakis campaign signaled its 
intention to unveil the running mate choice before the democratic 
national convention begins on july 18 
a report in todays boston herald quoted a campaign source as 
saying the decision may be announced by july 4 
gearan said no decision had been made on when a selection would 
be made or announced 
i think its much too early in the process to make any 
determination like that gearan said 
he said dukakis would meet privately with 20 to 30 or perhaps 
more senate democrats individually or in groups and would arrange 
a meeting with house members at a later time he said the vice 
presidency would be among the topics 
dukakis was winding down a fourday holiday in nantucket and 
finding out that likely presidential nominees dont really get away 
even on a getaway 
dukakis was accompanied on the trip by only a few aides but a 
large group of secret service bodyguards and a large contingent of 
reporters photographers and television crews 
speaking with the journalists friday in the yard of his borrowed 
vacation home dukakis noted the presence of the hefty entourage 
these days strolling around isnt what it used to be he 
said a bit wistfully 
the massachusetts governor and his wife were leaving this 
nantucket island resort off cape cod tonight 
the weather was too cool for the dukakises to visit the beach 
during their break from the presidential campaign rain and 
thunderstorms moved insunday and kept them inside the house where 
press secretary mark gearan said dukakis ate seafood read and 
relaxed 
hes just been relaxing this afternoon gearan said sunday 
at a briefing for journalists accompanying the candidate to the 
island 
gearan said dukakis steered clear of major work on his next big 
decision selecting a running mate 
he said the massachusetts governor did not even talk by 
telephone with aides in denver where the dukakis campaign 
succeeded in winning a proposed platform document free of calls for 
higher taxes and a defense budget freeze sought by rival jesse 
jackson 
while the party platform action was taken amid signals of party 
unity and displayed dukakis strength in controlling the platform 
issue gearan made no claim that the democratic national convention 
in atlanta next month would be free of floor battles over the 
platform 
we have a good working relationship with jacksons campaign 
and things are going well gearan said 
but he added i think hes said all along there could very 
well be some floor fights at the convention 
gearan responded to comments by vice president george bush the 
certain republican nominee who has criticized massachusetts 
prison furlough program and stepped up his charges last week by 
saying drug dealers were being released on weekend passes 
gearan said a 1983 state law signed by dukakis imposed mandatory 
sentences for drug dealers that prohibits furlough releases 
dukakis and his wife kitty who is wearing a neck brace while 
she recovers from spinal surgery took walks around the area before 
the rain came and they slipped into the village of nantucket for 
dinner at a fashionable restaurant saturday night 
dukakis and his wife are staying at the colonialstyle home of 
longtime friends bernard and grace grossman situated on a 
wellmanicured hillside overlooking the water 
they took most of their meals at their hosts table where mrs 
grossman served shrimp and prepared homemade apple pie and peach 
muffins 
the dukakis daughter kara joined them with a college friend for 
breakfast sunday morning mrs dukakis went into town shopping with 
her daughter and grace grossman while dukakis read the sunday 
newspapers 
dukakis known for being budgetconscious in his personal 
habits said on arriving he had no plans for shopping not a bit 
of it mrs dukakis who likes to shop while on campaign trips 
leaned over and said we havent discussed it 
dukakis was returning to boston on a commercial commuter flight 
monday night and planned to be back in his statehouse offices 
tuesday mrs dukakis was traveling to nearby marthas vineyard 
another island off cape cod for several days of relaxing while 
dukakis plans a threeday campaign trip through six midwestern 
states

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether prison officials sometimes must explain why they bar an 
inmate from having visitors 
the justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling 
that a kentucky prisons visitation program created a liberty 
interest for inmates that cannot be infringed upon without due 
process 
the appeals court ruling did not say what kind of due process 
perhaps a written explanation of denied visitation rights or some 
type of hearing is required but kentucky officials appealed 
anyway 
more than half the states supported kentuckys appeal in a 
friendofthecourt brief urging the high court to issue a 
decision setting precedent nationally 
they said the kentucky prisons visitation policy is similar to 
those at prisons in many states 
more significantly there are a number of other policies at 
the correctional institutions concerning the daily operation of 
prisons ranging from inmate job assignments to telephone privileges 
which in all likelihood are also affected the states brief 
contended 
the kentucky controversy stems from a lawsuit inmates of the 
kentucky state reformatory in lagrange filed over conditions there 
the suit resulted in a 1980 consent decree in which the state 
agreed among other things to continue an open visitation 
policy 
state officials subsequently adopted guidelines and procedures 
for handling prison visits 
in 1985 inmate kenneth bolitts mother was denied the right to 
visit him temporarily because she had brought to the prison with 
her a man previously barred for smuggling contraband 
inmate kevin blacks mother and girlfriend were barred from the 
prison temporarily because black had been convicted of possessing 
contraband immediately after one of their visits 
a class action lawsuit filed in behalf of all the prisons 
inmates contended that the suspension of visitors privileges 
without any dueprocess hearing was unlawful 
a federal trial judge ruled for the inmates and the 6th us 
circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling last nov 19 
given the regulatory and mandatory language in the visitation 
policy guidelines a liberty interest was created under the 
circumstances here the appeals court said 
it sent the case back to a trial judge to determine the 
particular procedural process due the inmates when visitation is 
denied 
in seeking supreme court review state officials said the 
appeals court ruling potentially binding law in kentucky ohio 
michigan and tennessee could inhibit substantially corrections 
officials from drafting policies that may confer a benefit on an 
inmate 
kentuckys appeal said the 6th circuit courts ruling could 
affect such inmate benefits as honor housing furloughs work and 
study programs outside trips recreation escorted leaves and 
inmate clubs 
finding that such policies create a constitutionally protected 
interest is untenable the appeal contended 
the case is kentucky vs thompson 871815

dredging reopened shallow parts of the mississippi and ohio 
rivers to barges today but weekend rain over parts of the parched 
south did little to end the drought there and a us senator 
threatened to hit crop speculators with hobnailed boots 
the bottom line is that the drought is not alleviated really 
in the worst areas the midwest and the tennessee valley 
national weather service meteorologist pete reynolds said today 
from kansas city mo 
the best chance for rain in those areas suffering the nations 
worst drought since the dust bowl is not until friday so were 
still looking for a pretty dry week reynolds said 
on sunday thunderstorms boomed through much of the dry 
southeast but temperatures reached 105 degrees in some places 
temperatures in the northern plains sizzled at up to 108 degrees 
sunday temperature records fell or were tied in a dozen cities 
scattered showers and thunderstorms also fell in the lower 
mississippi valley and the southern plains 
heavier rainfall in six hours ending sunday evening included 3 
inches in dothan ala 1 inches in oklahoma city and more than an 
inch in fort campbell ky 
also sunday senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy 
predicted that food prices would rise 2 percent to 4 percent next 
year because of the drought 
the vermont democrat said on cbs face the nation his 
committee would monitor market activity in farm products 
if my committee finds that anybody is speculating on this 
taken whats happening to these farmers whether its 
grocery stores producers or exporters or anybody else were going 
to come own on them with hobnailed boots he said 
leahy said that although such speculation was not illegal those 
engaging in it would run the risk of being called before his 
committee to explain how they bought profits based on the misery 
of farmers 
the drought could cost cattle producers in arkansas alone up to 
100 million off last years total of 400 million because sales 
of cattle in the face of dwindling grass are driving prices down 
howard young executive vice president of the arkansas cattlemans 
association said today 
record low water has slowed commercial traffic and repeatedly 
caused huge barge backups on the mississippi and ohio rivers 
at st louis the mississippi was reopened sunday afternoon 
releasing a traffic jam estimated at 1000 barges coast guard 
spokesman gary cooper said today that the backlog had cleared and 
traffic is moving well as of this moment 
down river at memphis tenn traffic moved slowly but steadily 
early today said chief warrant officer jackie tucker more than 
1100 barges had backed up until friday when the army corps of 
engineers finished cutting a channel through a sand buildup 
there are problems on the river but they are manageable 
well keep it open said robert page assistant secretary of the 
army for civil works 
the army corps of engineers has identified 30 to 35 possible 
trouble spots on the lower mississippi most within 100 miles of 
memphis but dredges will keep them open most of the time said 
brig gen thomas a sands who heads the mississippi river 
commission 
sands and page toured the lower mississippi on sunday with rear 
adm william leahy of the coast guard 
on the ohio river a section near mound city ill remained 
open sunday after being closed much of saturday but the flow of 
water toward the city stopped when a dam a few miles up river was 
closed 
its going to get shallower warned coast guard lt ron 
blake 
the coast guard would decide whether to close the river 
indefinitely because of shallow water but without relief the river 
may soon get too low to pass blake said 
on the missouri river the corps of engineers decided last 
weekend to end the commercial navigation season in midnovember 
instead of the usual dec 1 to conserve dwindling water supplies 
the drought also threatens to snuff traditional fourth of july 
fireworks because of the fire danger and michigan gov james 
blanchard has imposed a statewide ban on open burning 
on the dry northern plains a weekold forest fire on the 
montanasouth dakota border burned an estimated 50000 acres by 
today after 45 mph wind helped it break through an army of 
firefighters sunday and race several miles northward it had been 
70 percent contained before the outbreak 
we essentially lost all firefighting capabilities 
information officer jack kendley said sunday night in billings 
mont 
elsewhere four weekend wildfires charred more than 700 acres of 
droughtdry grassland in southern california including one blaze 
that injured 10 and damaged four homes rain and lower temperatures 
helped firefighters control a 137acre fire in the boise national

the order of jose marti the 19th century cuban revolutionary 
this visit is to further strengthen our relations said

1981 to overthrow the leftist sandinista government 
at home ortega faces deep social economic and political 
problems two weeks ago he announced measures to steer the economy 
away from socialist policies toward capitalism the cuban

the supreme court today agreed to referee 
environmental disputes over the planned development of a ski resort 
in washingtons methow valley and an unfinished dam on elk creek in 
southern oregon 
the justices said they will decide whether additional 
environmental impact studies are required before federal agencies 
may give final approval to both projects 
justice department lawyers had appealed both lower court rulings 
sandy butte a 6000foot mountain in the okanogan national 
forest overlooks the methow valley a sparsely populated area on 
the eastern side of the north cascade mountains in washington 
the valley is a winter home for washingtons largest migratory 
deer herd 
methow recreation inc in 1978 asked for permission to develop 
and operate a ski resort to be called early winters on sandy 
butte and a large parcel of land it had bought adjoining the 
mountain 
the project is expected to spawn extensive commercial and 
residential development in the methow valley 
the us forest service in 1982 published a draft environmental 
impact statement and a final statement in 1984 
in late 1985 the methow valley citizens council sued in federal 
court the suit contended among other things that the forest 
service had violated the national environmental policy act of 1969 
in approving the early winters project 
a federal trial judge dismissed the suit but the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals reinstated it 
the appeals court ruled that the forest service must come up 
with detailed and effective mitigation measures to protect the 
valleys air quality the deer herd and other environmental aspects 
the appeals court said the forest services impact statement 
offered no assurance whatsoever that the vague mitigation 
objectives it features would ever in fact be achieved or even 
that effective measures would ever be designed let alone 
implemented if the early winters development were to proceed 
the 9th circuit court concluded that the impact statements 
discussion of mitigation measures is inadequate as a matter of 
law 
the oregon controversy dates back to 1962 when congress 
authorized construction of the rogue river basin project a flood 
control program in the southern part of the state 
elk creek dam was one of three dams included in the project and 
is the only one not completed and operating 
elk creek is a tributary of the rogue river one of eight rivers 
in the nation designated as wild and scenic by a 1968 law the 
rogue is known for its whitewater rafting and flyfishing 
the corps of engineers filed a series of environmental impact 
statements on the elk creek project from 1971 through 1980 before 
the oregon natural resources council and other environmental groups 
sued 
the lawsuit contended that the corps of engineers failed to 
comply with the natural environmental policy act of 1969 by 
submitting an incomplete final environmental impact statement 
the 9th circuit court agreed stating an eis must include a 
discussion of measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of 
the proposed action 
because the wildlife mitigation plan here merely lists 
measures to be used and includes neither an analysis nor an 
explanation of effectiveness it is inadequate to satisfy the 
nepa the appeals court added 
the cases are robertson vs methow valley citizens council 
871703 and marsh vs oregon natural resources council 871704

the supreme court today gave defense 
contractors important protection against lawsuits by people who 
accuse them of making defective equipment that causes death or 
injury 
the justices by a 54 vote refused to reinstate a 725000 
award to the family of a marine helicopter copilot who died in a 
1983 crash in the atlantic ocean near virginia beach va 
the court said companies may not be sued when they make military 
equipment using a design approved by the pentagon as long as the 
contractors did not conceal any potential hazards from the 
government 
the supreme court previously has ruled that members of the armed 
services may not sue the government directly over injuries suffered 
in connection with the military service 
todays ruling marked the first time the high court has extended 
similar protection to military contractors 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said state laws 
authorizing personal injury suits generally are preempted by the 
federal governments need to make unfettered military decisions 
we are of the view that state law which holds government 
contractors liable for design defects in military equipment does in 
some circumstances present a significant conflict with federal 
policy and must be displaced he said 
scalia said suits against contractors are barred when the 
pentagon approves reasonably precise specifications the equipment 
conforms to those specifications and the supplier warns the 
government about potential dangers the equipment poses 
in a sharply worded dissent justice william j brennan said 
the courts newly discovered government contractor defense is 
breathtakingly sweeping 
he said this court lacks both authority and expertise to 
fashion such broad protection for contractors whether to 
protect the treasury of the united states or the coffers of 
industry 
the power to devise rules on when contractors may be sued should 
be left to congress where our constitution places it brennan 
said 
the ruling comes at a time when pentagon contracting is under 
extraordinary scrutiny with an investigation underway into alleged 
fraud and bribery in military procurement todays decision is not 
connected to that investigation 
todays ruling also could have a bearing on the us shuttle 
disaster some lawyers have argued that granting military 
contractors broad protection from lawsuits would shield morton 
thiokol maker of the shuttle 
todays case stemmed from a federal jury award of 725000 to 
the family of david boyle who drowned april 27 1983 in the crash 
of a ch53 helicopter 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in may 1986 threw out the 
award against the helicopter manufacturer sikorsky aircraft and 
its parent company united technologies corp 
the appeals court said sikorsky as a government military 
contractor was shielded from damages based on alleged design 
defects in the helicopter the appeals court also said there was 
insufficient evidence to prove that sikorsky improperly repaired a 
steering control system in the helicopter 
the company was accused of negligence in the design of the 
helicopters escape hatch 
boyle and the three other crew members survived the crash 
impact the three others escaped through emergency hatches but 
boyle was unable to force his hatch to open against the pressure of 
the water 
his family also charged that sikorsky defectively repaired the 
pilot valve of the helicopters servo which acts as a form of 
power steering to help the pilot fly the helicopter 
the 4th circuit court said a military contractor generally is 
free from liability for design defects if it can show its product 
conformed to pentagon specifications and if it warned the military 
about known dangers in the use of the equipment 
the appeals court noted that sikorsky built the helicopter with 
the navy reviewing its design including a mockup of the cockpit 
with all instruments controls and escape hatches in place 
the appeals court also said allegations that sikorsky improperly 
overhauled the steering mechanism were conjectural 
the supreme court today sent the case back to the 4th circuit 
court but only to restudy a fairly narrow issue 
the justices said the judgment for the boyles must be thrown out 
if the 4th circuit court decides that the jury properly applied the 
military contractor defense 
the supreme court said the suit could be reinstated if the 
appeals court improperly acted as a trial court and decided itself 
that the facts of the case established the military contractor 
defense 
but in key respects todays ruling appears to give military 
contractors legal protection that goes beyond the ban on suits by 
members of the armed forces for injuries suffered in connection 
with military duty 
the court extended the protection for contractors to cases in 
which civilians are injured 
joining scalia were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor and anthony m 
kennedy the dissenters besides brennan were justices thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
the case is boyle vs united technologies corp 86492

the spooks who torment the major characters 
in tennessee williams the night of the iguana never seem very 
threatening in the mild revival which arrived sunday at the circle 
in the square theater 
the drama first performed in new york in 1961 simmers in 
obvious symbolism but this production hampered by miscasting and 
perfunctory staging doesnt even capitalize on the plays more 
florid poetry it dilutes williams story eliminating much of the 
passion and leaving only the bare bones of the story 
the time is 1940 the setting is a dilapidated tourist hotel on 
the western coast of mexico and the iguana of the title is a 
trapped creature tied up and kept under the hotel porch where it 
is being fattened up as a future meal 
the main characters also are trapped bound by their own fears 
and failures chief among these neurotic captives is the rev t 
lawrence shannon a defrocked minister reduced to leading bible 
belt ladies on thirdrate bus tours of the mexican countryside 
shannon seeks refuge from the harridans on his tour in the hotel 
which is run by maxine a lusty and cynical widow among the other 
residents are the worlds oldest living poet struggling to 
write a final poem and the poets unmarried granddaughter who 
despite her spiritual quality displays a practicality that enables 
her to survive 
the exminister must battle his desire for liquor and 
particularly young girls a failing that has gotten him into 
trouble once again when the curtain rises as shannon explains 
when you live on the fantastic level as i have lately but have 
got to operate on the realistic level thats when youre spooked 
thats the spook 
nicolas surovy who plays the dissolute shannon doesnt capture 
the mans pain and weariness at having to perpetually struggle 
besides looking too young and healthy for the role surovy 
never manages to suggest that here is a man ready for death 
willing even to swim out to sea and drown if he could lose his 
problems 
equally unconvincing is jane alexander in the role originated on 
broadway by bette davis and in the movie version by ava gardner 
miss alexander seems uncomfortable as the blowsy maxine maybe 
wishing she were playing hannah the ethereal spinster maria 
tucci in the revivals best performance manages to portrayt 
hannahs steely resolve as well as her desperation at not knowing 
what will happen after her grandfather dies 
william lemassena doesnt suggest the mental and physical 
deterioration of the old poet but a comic pamela paytonwright 
exudes the proper shrillness as the most vocal of the irate 
tourists on shannons tour 
the lush tropical setting by zack brown spills nicely across the 
theaters elongated stage filled with rocks leafy plants and 
exotic trees but director theodore mann doesnt utilize the set 
at times the characters stand around awkwardly looking like they 
are staring into a black void rather than conversing with another 
person on stage 
the production ends up being a literal static remounting of the 
play without the fire that should ignite the story this night 
of the iguana ends up as a long snooze rather than a compelling 
drama of coping with personal demons that never will go away 
what other critics said 
in the new york times mel gussow wrote unsteadily guided by 
mr mann the production seems alternately languorous and 
heavyhanded the costa verde is in place with all its out of 
season seediness ready to welcome its disparate lonely 
characters but with the definite exception of ms tucci the 
theatrical hotel is not amply inhabited 
howard kissel in the daily news said watching tennessee 
williams night of the iguana i kept wondering if ted mann who 
directed it and who runs circle in the square which recently 
presented a lame streetcar wants to do to williams what joe papp 
is doing to shakespeare present his plays so flatly youd never 
know the author was a poet 
clive barnes of the new york post wrote in the final 
count it lacks something in urgency and anxiety partly because of 
the conventionally distraught but essentially bland portrayal given 
by nicolas surovy as shannon this is still a play in search of 
its ultimate definition a definition that cannot come oddly 
enough until a great and perhaps bizarre actor shows us how 
the play can really work

the supreme court today said federal judges 
have substantial authority to award fees to lawyers who win suits 
against the government 
the justices voting 62 said a california antipoverty law 
firm is entitled to recover legal fees for sucessfully challenging 
the withholding of federal housing subsidies 
but the court said 322700 in fees awarded to the firm is 
excessive and ordered further hearings to determine a lower amount 
the reagan administration had argued that the fee was both 
excessive and not justified at all 
the western center on law and poverty in los angeles represented 
tenants of governmentsubsidized housing seeking to force the 
department of housing and urban development to pay increased costs 
for utilities and local taxes 
the tenants challenged a decision by hud secretary samuel pierce 
not to use money from a rental reserve fund to pay the costs 
the case was settled when the government agreed to deposit 60 
million into a special escrow fund to be distributed to needy 
tenants and to owners of subsidized housing 
while the settlement was being administered congress in 1980 
passed the equal access to justice act to compensate attorneys who 
win lawsuits against the government 
the law generally imposes a 75perhour ceiling for lawyers 
fees but permits higher hourly pay in some circumstances 
the law authorizes judges to award legal fees to the winning 
side in suits against the government unless the judge finds the 
governments position was substantially justified or that special 
circumstances make an award unjust 
a federal judge in the california case applied an hourly rate 
ranging from 80 to 120 totaling 322700 the judge said the 
litigation was complex protracted and required attorneys with 
special skills and qualifications 
the reagan administration said the tenants surrendered their 
right to the lawyers fees when they agreed to the settlement it 
also argued that the 75 per hour ceiling should be used if any 
legal fees are awarded 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court today upheld the 
authority of the trial judge to decide that pierces position was 
not substantially justified as defined in the equal access to 
justice act 
but scalia said the 75anhour cap must apply granting the 
lawyers higher fees must be based on more than the factors cited by 
the judge in the case scalia said 
justices byron r white and sandra day oconnor in a dissenting 
opinion voted to strike down the award of legal fees entirely 
justice anthony m kennedy did not take part in the ruling 
the case is pierce vs underwood 861512

prime minister gro harlem brundtland of norway 
today accused rich nations of playing lethal games with the earths 
lifesupport system and made a proposal to combat the greenhouse 
effect and protect the atmosphere 
in a keynote address to the canadiansponsored world conference 
on the changing atmosphere dr brundtland a noted 
environmentalist told more than 300 scientists and politicians 
from 40 countries 
the impact of climatic change may be greater and more drastic 
than any other challenges that mankind has faced with the exception 
of the threat of nuclear war 
she called for a new global ethic in which protection 
against air and water pollution ozone depletion and acid rain is a 
prerequisite for economic development 
we have been playing lethal games with vital lifesupport 
systems said brundtland 
her fivepoint plan included development of renewable energy 
sources in the next century the transfer of modern lowpolluting 
technologies to third world countries more research on climatic 
change and consideration of a global convention on protecting the 
atmosphere 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney opened the fourday 
conference by offering to host a unrun world conference on 
sustainable development in 1992 
by that time he urged participants an international law of 
the atmosphere should be negotiated to limit all types of air 
pollution 
those attending include the heads of un environmental 
agencies cabinet ministers from indonesia the netherlands and 
senegal scientists from harvard university and the soviet academy 
of sciences and us sen timothy e wirth dcolo and us rep 
george e brown jr dcalif 
scientists will discuss ozone depletion acid rain water 
management and food prospects but much interest centers on the 
recent warming of the earths surface due to the greenhouse effect 
in which gases humans have introduced into the atmosphere prevent 
heat from escaping 
although experts are not yet ready to ascribe the 1988 drought 
to the greenhouse effect the earth has been warmer in the first 
five months of this year than in any comparable period since 
measurements began 130 years ago a nasa climatologist james 
hansen told a congressional hearing in washington last week 
five of the warmest years on record have occurred in the 1980s 
and scientists at environment canada predict global temperatures 
could rise up to 8 degrees by the year 2050 partially melting the 
polar ice caps and raising sea levels three feet 
in the last 1000 years the climate fluctuated about a half 
of a degree now we can expect it to go up at 10 times that rate a 
phenomenal change unprecedented in human history henry 
hengeveld a climate expert for environment canada told a news 
conference 
the problem is manmade the burning of oil gas wood and coal 
in factories homes and cars sends the greenhouse gases of carbon 
dioxide nitrous oxide methane ozone and chlorofluorocarbons into 
the atmosphere 
for much of the world there are no alternatives to fossil fuel 
in developed countries public opinion has turned against the 
cleaner option of nuclear power because of the risk of catastrophic 
accidents 
another major atmospheric problem is the gradual destruction of 
the thin ozone layer which protects the earth from the suns 
harmful ultraviolet rays chlorofluorocarbons used in spray cans 
insulation refrigerators and industrial cleaning tear holes in the 
ozone and the result has been a marked increase in skin cancer 
twentyfour nations signed the montreal protocol on ozone last 
year pledging to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons by 50 
percent by 1999 
mcdonalds restaurants promised to use something else to insulate 
their takeaway packaging and a new type of refrigerator with 
helium as a coolant is under development but global protection 
remains a distant goal 
canadas first atmospheric priority is acid rain the government 
blames power plant emissions from the us midwest for at least 
half the acid rain falling in eastern canada which has led to the 
destruction of fish life in 14000 lakes and extensive forest 
damage

northwest airlines has on order up to 100 
airbus a320 jetliners like the one that crashed during a 
demonstration flight in france a company official said 
the twinengine air france aircraft crashed in a forest at the 
end of an airfield in eastern france near the swiss border three 
passengers were killed and 50 others were injured 
i doubt the crash would have an impact on our decision to 
purchase from airbus alan muncaster a spokesman for northwest 
said sunday but obviously we would want to check into the cause 
of the crash 
northwest based in this st paul suburb and airbus announced 
in october 1986 that northwest would buy up to 100 airbus a320s 
from its manufacturer airbus industrie in a deal that would be 
worth 32 billion 
pan american world airways has ordered 16 a230s with an option 
to buy 34 more in addition two us leasing companies have 
ordered the a320 gatx air has ordered 10 and international lease 
finance corp has three on order 
a spokesman for airbus industrie said there were indications 
that human error caused sundays crash but the president of the 
airlines pilots union said its engines may have failed to restart 
at the pilots command 
the jet went into service in april for air france and british 
airways and last thursday air france took delivery of the plane 
that crashed 
the airbus a320 is the first civilian airliner equipped with a 
fully computerized flightcontrol system which the manufacturer 
says permits safer electronically controlled flight 
the aircraft carries 168 people and consumes 40 percent less 
fuel than similar two or three engine jets 
the northwest agreement calls for delivery of up to 100 
a320200s between 1990 and 1995 northwest must make a firm 
commitment on 10 a320s for delivery in 1990 and 1991 
the toulouse francebased airbus industrie consortium says it 
has more than 500 orders or letters of intent to buy the a320 
france britain west germany and spain are partners in airbus

a leading reformer said monday he doubts leon 
trotsky will be restored to communist party ranks even if the 
revolutionarys role in securing bolshevik power is recognized and 
his writings published 
asked by a greek reporter whether trotsky would be 
rehabilitated otto latsis deputy editor of the monthly kommunist 
said there are different kinds of rehabilitation 
trotsky may undergo what latsis termed civilian 
rehabilitation in that his contribution to the bolshevik 
revolution and to winning the civil war against the white guards 
should be recognized he said 
restoration to party ranks was another matter he said 
i dont think there is any basis for that said latsis 
trotsky was not excluded from the party in 1937 but in 1927 for 
his antiparty activity 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev announced in november that a 
central committee commission would review the cases of those who 
had suffered under dictator josef v stalin and would restore honor 
to people who were unjustly repressed 
since then revolutionaries nikolai v bukharin lev kamenev and 
grigory zinoviev are among those who have been formally cleared of 
what are now seen as trumpedup charges in show trials in the late 
1930s but they have not been restored to party ranks 
leading historian yuri n afanasyev said on june 17 that trotsky 
should be exonerated of criminal charges and his works republished 
for all 
trotsky has been reviled for half a century as a traitor and the 
archenemy of socialism 
recognition of his revolutionary role would directly counter an 
orthodoxy that has gone unchallenged for 60 years it would also 
signal how deeply the soviet union is now questioning the legacy of 
stalin who ruled the country from 1924 to his death in 1953 
born lev d bronstein the son of a jewish farmer trotsky was a 
central figure in the 1917 bolshevik revolution and the architect 
of the red armys victory in the civil war that followed it 
he served successively as commissar for foreign affairs and then 
for war but was bested by stalin in the infighting which followed 
the death of vladimir i lenin in 1924 
after his expulsion from the party in 1927 trotsky was expelled 
from the country in 1929 in the 193638 show trials that 
accompanied stalins bloody purges trotsky was accused of treason 
in 1940 he was murdered in mexico city reportedly by a soviet 
agent 
talking about rehabilitation for trotsky latsis said we have 
to stop the atmosphere around trotsky he played an important role 
in the civil war and the revolution we have to look at the role he 
played not more not less not better not worse 
his books should be available latsis added they are 
historical documents and a contribution to the general struggle 
soviet people should know about them 
afanasyev said on june 17 that all those accused on false 
evidence should be rehabilitated including trotsky

the senate passed a 159 billion 1989 
spending bill for the treasury department the postal service and 
several other agencies today that diverts money from the internal 
revenue service to antidrug programs 
the lawmakers approved the measure on a 814 vote the house 
version of the legislation would spend 1963 million more for the 
agencies so the two chambers will have to work out their 
differences before sending the bill to president reagan for his 
signature 
the bill would cut the irs budget proposed by reagan and 
approved by the house by 241 million to just under 51 billion 
the same amount the agency is spending this year the money would 
instead be given to the customs service which would have a budget 
of 105 billion 
administration officials have complained that the reduction in 
the irs coffers would hinder that agencys ability to collect taxes 
for the government and to process returns quickly irs commissioner 
lawrence b gibbs has complained that the reduction could cut 
revenues by 14 billion next year 
as part of the customs service efforts against illegal drugs 
the bill recommends the agency buy a surveillance airship capable 
of carrying a sensor that can detect ship movements in the gulf of 
mexico the measure includes money for customs to develop four 
longrange p3 planes to use in drug surveillance missions 
the bill also calls for a 4 percent pay increase in 1989 for all 
federal civilian employees except members of congress and 41 
percent for military personnel

loggerheads over the effect of the protests of the 1960s agreement

a williamsburg county weekly newspaper 
editor has been indicted on charges of criminally libeling two 
state lawmakers court officials announced today 
the charges were brought by state rep bj gordon and state 
sen frank mcgill both democrats after editor jim fitts wrote a 
column urging voters to reject the politicians in the june primary 
and accused them of stealing 
the charges were presented to a grand jury and fitts showed no 
reaction as the jurys decision was read he said afterwards that 
he was looking forward to telling his story in court i got what 
i wanted he said 
though libel cases are not unusual criminal libel cases that 
can send a journalist to jail are the williamsburg county case is 
believed to be only the fourth involving journalists in 40 years in 
south carolina and the first since 1984 
the case will be tried in late august or early september 
solicitor wade kolb has said if convicted fitts could face 5000 
in fines and a year in prison on each of the two counts 
wallace connor attorney for both lawmakers said he was 
satisfied with the indictment 
i think mr fitts has gone too far with it he apparently 
wants to have the publicity regardless of what so well 
accommodate him he said i think hes got a million dollars 
worth of publicity for a slander sheet 
fitts 62 said he would ask to move the trial from williamsburg 
county 
the power structure has long roots in williamsburg county 
he said 
fitts editor of the voice a blackoriented newspaper with a 
circulation of 2300 in a poor rural county of about 40000 riled 
gordon who is black and mcgill who is white with a column in 
his may 17 edition 
fitts wrote in part i will say to you without fear of 
contradiction if every black in williamsburg county would start 
stealing today and steal every day for the rest of their lives 
they could not steal as much as those two have stolen during their 
time in power 
the column gave no specifics and when asked later what he 
thought they had stolen he said only that they had taken the pride 
of people of williamsburg county both politicians won their june 
14 elections 
fitts who was jailed for two nights on the charges before being 
released on bond said thursday that an indictment and jail term 
might help him by drawing more attention to the problems of blacks 
in the county 
ive always been opinionated he said i just have an 
opinion and i have no problem sharing it 
jane kirtley executive director of the reporters committee for 
freedom of the press in washington has said that fitts made a 
political statement about two politicians 
it seems to me that punishing someone for speaking is not an 
american concept she said

advisers to tawana brawley the young woman who 
refuses to help police investigate her charges that she was 
assaulted are accusing a federal prosecutor and a television 
reporter of conspiring to obstruct justice 
meanwhile manhattan borough president david dinkins questioned 
the tactics of the three advisers accusing them of doing damage to 
the civil rights movement with their wild charges 
dinkins the citys highestranking elected black official made 
his comments sunday about the rev al sharpton and brawley 
attorneys c vernon mason and alton maddox jr on wabctvs 
eyewitness news conference 
the brawley case began when the teenager was found last 
november in a plastic bag smeared with dog excrement she claimed 
that she had been raped and assaulted by six white men 
her family and family advisers have since claimed that she 
cannot get justice from authorities and her family has refused to 
cooperate in the investigation 
at a news conference sunday mason and sharpton threatened a 
100 million lawsuit against wcbstv in response to saturdays 
arrest of samuel mcclease 
mcclease had claimed in an interview with the station that he 
had tape recordings that would cast doubt on the brawley story but 
tapes he gave to federal authorities were blank and he was charged 
saturday with obstruction of justice and perjury 
certainly with the arrest of mr mcclease channel 2 wcbs 
has knowingly participated in slandering me slandering the 
brawleys and slandering the advisers sharpton said 
mcclease 26 a selfproclaimed surveillance expert claimed 
that sharpton had hired him to bug conversations involving mason 
and maddox 
in the wcbs broadcast mcclease said the tapes revealed that 
there was no evidence to support the black teenagers contentions 
that she was abducted by a gang of white men and that the advisers 
knew this 
the advisers said sunday that they want wcbs reporter mike 
taibbi and us attorney rudolph giuliani to explain why they gave 
credence to mcclease 
rudolph giuliani and mike taibbi met agreed conspired 
combined to obstruct justice in the tawana brawley case mason 
said maddox was not at the news conference 
sharpton said giuliani helped taibbi undermine black 
leadership by subpoenaing mcclease 
giuliani said the statements are illogical and not worthy of 
response 
phyllis stewart a spokeswoman for wcbstv said the station 
would have no comment on the advisers statements 
dinkins said on wabctv that he was particularly bothered by 
comments sharpton maddox and mason have made about gov mario 
cuomo and state attorney general robert abrams 
the advisers have compared abrams who is special prosecutor in 
the case to adolf hitler and labeled cuomo a racist 
i dont think they help their cause or ours by calling the 
governor and robert abrams and others names dinkins said i 
mean just wild charges unsubstantiated and i am confident 
untrue 
as they seek to focus on the inequities in the criminal 
justice system they dont do the cause any good and they 
certainly dont appear to be assisting the cause of bringing to 
justice the culprit in the tawana brawley situation dinkins said

the supreme court today gave communities 
nationwide broader power to ban picketing of private residences 
by a 63 vote the court said such bans do not necessarily 
violate freespeech rights 
the decision is a defeat for antiabortion activists who were 
barred from picketing a doctors home in the milwaukee suburb of 
brookfield wis 
the ruling could also represent a significant setback for unions 
locked in labor disputes 
in another case the court gave defense contractors important 
protection against lawsuits by people who accuse them of making 
defective equipment that causes death or injury 
the justices by a 54 vote refused to reinstate a 725000 
award to the family of a marine helicopter copilot who died in a 
1983 crash in the atlantic ocean near virginia beach va 
in the picketing case a brookfield ordinance that outlaws 
picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any 
individual is tailored narrowly enough to protect freedom of 
speech while protecting residents privacy the court said 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said the 
ordinance is limited to picketing taking place solely in front of 
a particular residence 
so narrowed the ordinance permits the more general 
dissemination of a message oconnor said general marching 
through residential neighborhoods or even walking a route in front 
of an entire block of houses is not prohibited by this ordinance 
but justice john paul stevens in a dissenting opinion said 
brookfields ordinance makes it unlawful for a fifth grader to 
carry a sign saying get well charlie our team needs you in 
front of a residence for a period of time necessary to convey its 
friendly message to its intended audience 
an antiabortion group the milwaukee coalition for life 
demonstrated in front of dr benjamin victorias home in brookfield 
on at least six occasions in 1985 
victoria performs abortions as part of his medical practice in 
milwaukee and appleton wis 
the demonstrators carried signs protesting abortion and shouted 
slogans such as dr victoria youre a killer 
the demonstrations ranged in size from 11 to more than 40 people 
in the month that the picketing occurred the brookfield town 
board enacted the disputed ordinance challenged in court by 
demonstrators sandra c schultz and robert l braun 
us district judge john w reynolds in milwaukee barred 
brookfield from enforcing the ordinance by issuing a preliminary 
injunction 
he ruled that the ordinance probably is unconstitutional because 
a public street is the type of traditional public forum where a 
flat ban on speech cannot be tolerated 
an evenly divided 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld the 
injunction 
today the supreme court reversed the appeals court ruling 
because the picketing prohibited by the brookfield ordinance 
is speech directed primarily at those who are presumptively 
unwilling to receive it the town has a substantial and 
justifiable interest in banning it oconnor said 
the nature and scope of this interest make the ban narrowly 
tailored the ordinance also leaves open ample alternative channels 
of communication and is contentneutral she said 
ms schultz head of the milwaukee coalition for life said i 
understand that marching is still okay and we can go up and down 
the block a little further im a little confused about the 
distinction and how far we have to go down the street before its 
legal so we will just change our tactics and go a little 
further down the street it wont deter our movement 
harold furhman an attorney hired by town of brookfield said 
im very delighted with the decision and feel that it is 
consistent with the argument throughout both in our oral 
arguments and in our briefs 
no matter what form or type of speech is involved past court 
rulings have let government place reasonable restrictions on the 
time place or manner of expression 
but such restrictions must be contentneutral be narrowly 
tailored serve a significant governmental interest and leave open 
alternate channels for communicating the same message 
during oral arguments last april fuhrman contended for 
brookfield that the ordinance was aimed only at pickets who 
concentrated on one particular home and not at those who chose to 
parade through a residential neighborhood with their messages 
the justices appeared then to find signficance in that 
interpretation of the ordinance and in the fact that the 
antiabortion group was free to picket victoria at his places of 
business or in brookfields two commercial areas 
at one point during the april argument session justice antonin 
scalia said to the demonstrators lawyer you want to harass this 
doctor you want to stick your thumb in his eye isnt that what 
this is all about 
oconnors opinion adopted fuhrmans interpretation of the 
ordinance 
brookfields ordinance had been defended in 
friendofthecourt briefs submitted by the national league of 
cities the us conference of mayors and the national association 
of counties 
the picketers were supported by an unusual coalition of 
organizations including the american civil liberties union the 
antiabortion american life league christian advocates serving 
evangelism and the aflcio 
joining oconnor in upholding the ordinance were chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices harry a blackmun byron r 
white antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
joining stevens in dissent were justices william j brennan and 
thurgood marshall 
in other action the court 
loosened the requirements for law enforcement agents to first 
obtain court warrants before conducting searches on private 
property 
the justices split 43 in ruling that evidence initially 
discovered during an unlawful search sometimes may be used at trial 
if the same evidence is rediscovered during a second lawful 
search 
agreed to decide whether military veterans disability 
benefits indirectly may be subjected to a states community 
property law when they divorce 
the court said it will review a ruling that californias 
required splitting of benefits with exspouses does not violate 
federal law 
let stand a ruling that grants an exemption from state sales 
taxes to highstakes bingo games run by indian tribes 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by oklahoma 
officials seeking to impose the tax on revenue from a bingo game in 
tulsa run by the muscogee creek nation 
agreed to decide whether prison officials sometimes must 
explain why they bar an inmate from having visitors 
the justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling 
that a kentucky prisons visitation program created a liberty 
interest for inmates that cannot be infringed without due process 
said federal judges have substantial authority to award fees 
to lawyers who win suits against the government 
the justices voting 62 said a california antipoverty law 
firm is entitled to recover legal fees for successfully challenging 
the withholding of federal housing subsidies 
the picketing case is frisby vs schultz 87168

right behind the flag by kevin heelan is one 
of those mysterious little comedies that starts strong and then 
fades in the finish in this case because of a murky plot 
permutation involving drugs 
heelans angry banter is fast funny and frequently on target as 
it illuminates the angst of an airconditioner salesman named 
bernie who has little good to say about the state of the world 
particularly what is happening to his rapidly gentrifying 
neighborhood on manhattans west side 
bernie rails against the world particularly its moral 
bankruptcy and then is faced with a crisis when his good friend 
frankie stands to make a lot of money from the distribution of 
hightech pharmaceuticals to manhattan yuppies 
kevin spacey exposes his soul and a great deal more in capturing 
bernies manic desperation the actor sustains the characters 
intensity even when the story sags its fascinating to watch his 
anger grow wondering how or if he can contain it 
but heelan lets the play get away from him particularly when he 
mixes in a female reporter amy aquino who shows some feeling for 
bernie and a babyfaced drug kingpin played with smarmy skill by 
paul mccrane neither is developed satisfactorily 
right behind the flag a production at offbroadwas 
playwrights horizons can be savored for spaceys performance 
otherwise its a deadend for much of heelans dark dialogue

there are 8 million stories in the naked city and you dont 
want to hear any of them proclaims a character in urban 
blight a new musical revue at offbroadways manhattan theater 
club 
yes you do particularly since some of the stories are by such 
talented writers as christopher durang wendy wasserstein jules 
feiffer george c wolfe terrence mcnally and ar gurney jr 
as in an any revue there are high and low points but the peaks 
outnumber the valleys in urban blight and director john 
tillinger doesnt let the evening dawdle 
wolfes scabrous satire of lovemaking in the 1980s is 
particularly funny ending with the partners wrapping themselves in 
saran wrap before the final fadeout equally mirthful but just as 
unsettling is durangs look at one of those female comics who will 
do anything for a laugh even insult themselves it contains a 
terrific performance by the squeakyvoiced faith prince who 
displays a superb sense of timing 
more somber topics are covered by andres mother mcnallys 
poignant examination of what happens after the death of an aids 
victim and a monologue by arthur miller on what a burglary does to 
ones sense of material possessions

v amp v only a new play by jim leonard has a modest sense of 
place but almost no sense of story to hold an audiences interest 
the season finale at offbroadways circle repertory company 
concerns the crumbling of the old order in this case an old 
italian coffee shop in new yorks little italy giving way to the 
gentrification 
the coffee shop in all its fading linoleum glory has been 
captured perfectly by set designer john lee beatty playwright 
leonard has more trouble defining its owner and customers most 
come through as cliches the ailing owner vito his dumb but 
goodnatured assistant a vulgar but wisecracking cop whos always 
looking for a handout and a lonely widow who complains about her 
daughter 
the plays one interesting character is nick played with the 
right degree of macho defiance by erich anderson hes the 
superintendent of the building and stands to make the most when the 
building goes coop but leonard doesnt do much with nick except 
set him up for the evenings violent and unsatisfactory conclusion 
v amp v only is one little restaurant to avoid

heard about the upscale ben amp jerrys ice 
cream from vermont how about some shorty amp blondies from oklahoma 
shorty and blondie are mules that crank out homemade ice cream 
when attached to an ice cream making machine assembled by bud 
potter 
its just like making ice cream on the back porch but instead 
of using a handle to turn the freezer a pair of mules does the 
job walking around the freezer in a circle potter said 
potter his brother don and ed atkin began making the 
mulepowered ice cream last summer and they attract a crowd 
whereever they go 
atkin selected shorty a 600pound white mule to turn the 
freezer 
hes a good little mule and he can do it potter said but 
its pretty hard to do it by himself its better with two mules 
on it 
thats when blondie a matching mule entered the picture 
ed handpicked them to make it look just right potter said 
the mules need to be a certain size and matched up to look good 
once the mules get started it takes about 20 minutes and 12 
sacks of ice to turn out a freezer full of ice cream potter said 
shorty knows all about making ice cream but he doesnt like 
it he likes oats and alfalfa hay potter said

republican george bush is facing the worst 
of both worlds a new poll suggested monday getting little help 
from voters satisfaction with the shortterm state of the economy 
while being hurt by fears about the longterm fate of the nation 
the vice president trails democrat michael dukakis in the survey 
conducted for the times mirror corp however the massachusetts 
governor is not well known to most of the public and that gives 
bush an opening to tighten the race in the fall said analyst 
norman ornstein 
this poll doesnt tell who will win the election ornstein 
told reporters for most americans michael dukakis is a blank 
slate in the next couple of months there will be a lot written on 
the slate and not just by dukakis but also by the media and by 
george bush and the republicans 
the survey the latest in a series for the media company 
conducted by the gallup organization is based on interviews with 
3021 adults in person from may 1322 the margin of potential 
sampling error was two percentage points 
the horserace numbers for the poll gave dukakis 53 percent of 
the registered voters and bush 40 percent seven percent were 
undecided 
bushs relatively weak showing could be partly a result of being 
saddled with the role of vice president but conventional wisdom 
would also suggest that he should benefit from the nations 
economic prosperity during the final six years of the reagan 
administration 
indeed many people are optimistic about their own finances and 
the national economy over the coming year fiftyfour percent think 
they will be personally better off next year while only 10 percent 
say their financial situation will deteriorate 
twentyfour percent think the national economy will improve in 
the next year while 46 percent believe there will be little 
change twenty percent are pessimistic 
but ornstein said bush has gotten the worst of both worlds 
pointing to poll findings that the public is very concerned about 
the longterm future and a feeling that things are out of control 
only 41 percent of the public was satisfied with the way 
things are going in the country while 54 percent were 
dissatisfied the poll said 
an indicator of the depth of the fears was the finding that 37 
percent said it is likely or certain that the us economy could 
collapse in the next 10 years because of foreign competition 
thus bush is not getting a boost from the economic picture 
while he is suffering from concerns about the reagan 
administrations stewardship 
fortythree percent of those questioned said the democratic 
party can bring about the kinds of changes the country needs 
with only 27 percent labeling the gop that way nine percent said 
both parties 11 percent said neither and 10 percent were not sure 
and this gives dukakis much of his strength 
democrats are seen as the party of change bush is not said 
andrew kohut president of the gallup organization 
overall dukakis drew a favorable response from 66 percent of 
the sample while 22 percent rated him unfavorably bush got 51 
percent positive marks and 42 percent negative 
but the dukakis numbers are the result of a vague mildly 
positive image the poll analysis said pointing out that 
relatively few voters could rate dukakis on a range of specific 
characteristics 
bushs image is a bit clearer since he has been on the national 
scene longer but he is stuck with some strong negatives and 
relatively few positives the analysis said 
asked in the poll if they were voting more for their candidate 
or against his opponent bush backers were mostly positive of his 
40 percent support 26 percentage points were based on probush 
sentiments and 11 percent antidukakis three percent were not sure 
but half of dukakis supporters took a negative stance of 
dukakis 53 percent only 22 percentage points were produkakis 26 
percent were antibush and the rest were not sure 
the times mirror surveys over the past year have divided the 
public into 11 groups based on their values and partisan 
affiliation 
dukakis is doing well in part because he is drawing strong 
support from usually democratic groups in fact the poll said that 
democrats are slightly more loyal to dukakis at this point than 
republicans are to bush a dramatic change from the high rates of 
democratic defection in recent decades at the presidential level 
bush has solid backing from key gop groups but the vice 
president has not won the strong support ronald reagan had in a 
group the poll calls the disaffecteds those who are 
pessimistic and deeply suspicious of both big government and big 
business

the light green leaves of some trees in 
the middle of the dark green forest of michigans lower peninsula 
have the fragile look of springs new growth and some scattered 
trees show exposed brown branches 
the thinner growth is evidence of a ravenous little caterpillar 
the juvenile stage of the gypsy moth that is making life 
miserable for uncounted people across the united states 
and the drought is increasing the damage as trees already 
weakened by lack of water try to fight off the effects of repeated 
defoliation by the hungry caterpillar 
now the trees are fighting just to stay alive said jim 
hanson forest entomologist for the us forest service in st 
paul minn 
trees will use up food reserves putting out a new growth of 
leaves he said they dont have anything left and they start 
declining 
two or three defoliations can kill a tree and the drought may 
hasten that process said frank sapio forest pest specialist for 
the michigan department of natural resources 
the caterpillar likes oaks best and can kill 20 percent to 30 
percent of the trees in a threeyear infestation hanson said but 
the pest eats more than 200 plant species 
from its initial foothold in new england the gypsy moth is 
slowly expanding its territory westward and southward its been 
detected in all of michigans 83 counties 
experts offer little hope for homeowners driven to distraction 
by caterpillars covering their houses and lawn furniture stripping 
their trees defecating everywhere and stinking when they die 
they are literally dripping off the eaves of homes said 
ronald priest manager of the gypsy moth program for the michigan 
department of agriculture 
sue eiseler moved to the harrison area about three years ago 
but already she and her husband are thinking about leaving 
we are totally covered she said this is the third year 
our trees are totally stripped its a like a nightmare 
if theyre chewing you can sit and listen to them state 
rep sid ouwinga said when you start getting 20 calls a day from 
your constituents in one county you know you have a problem 
theres no real threat to human health although some people can 
be allergic to the caterpillars 
experts have given up any hope of eradicating the pest and 
endorse spraying chemicals only in selected spots other than that 
they advise people to reduce the nuisance by scraping gypsy moth 
egg masses off houses and outdoor furniture and trying to keep the 
caterpillars out of trees by putting bands of burlap or sticky 
substances on the trunks 
the biggest thing is for people to understand teaching them 
that we cant eradicate them said rob hallet clare county 
chairperson for gypsy moth education theyre miserable theyre 
a nuisance but theyre here we cant get rid of them 
people demand something be done that translates into using 
pesticides priest said but at least one lawsuit filed by 
environmentalists has blocked spraying of one chemical in part of 
clare county 
that can be dangerous theyre spraying poisons hallet 
said 
a map shows heavy infestations along the east coast from maine 
to maryland some presence in ontario and quebec wide infestations 
covering much of lower michigan spot outbreaks in ohio illinois 
indiana illinois wisconsin and minnesota and some detection of 
the pest in oregon and washington 
the female lays its eggs on just about anything hanson 
said when people move theyre transporting these egg masses 
around the country 
according to experts in various states a naturally occurring 
virus killed many of the pests in massachusetts ohio and illinois 
are generally free of the insect now connecticut expects to near 
1987s figure of 127452 acres defoliated spraying in oregon and 
minnesota reduced their problem and the problem is in its earliest 
stages in colorado 
in 1985 michigan began a joint federalstatelocal program of 
voluntary spraying in 37 counties and officials are testing 
insects which feed on the moths the state paid 250000 for 
spraying this year

the more time that children especially boys 
spend in oneparent homes the less schooling they are likely to 
complete university researchers say 
and time spent with a single parent during the formative 
preschool years seems to have a particularly negative impact on a 
boys future education according to sheila fitzgerald krein and 
andrea h beller of the school of human resources and family 
studies at the university of illinois at urbana 
single working mothers appear to provide greater incentive as 
a role model for their daughters than their sons beller said in a 
telephone interview monday she said that while the rolemodel 
influence in the case of girls appears to compensate for the 
mothers loss of time at home the boy doesnt have this model 
he just has the loss of a parent 
with the nations increasing divorce rate about 60 percent of 
all children are now estimated to spend at least some of their 
childhood in a singleparent situation krein and beller reported 
this trend has aroused social concern in part because these 
families typically have fewer resources in particular time and 
money than twoparent families they reported in demography the 
journal of the population association of america 
educational advancement is one route out of poverty but the 
children in these families get significantly less of it thus this 
lower level of education will have longterm consequences for the 
economic wellbeing of the future family of this young adult the 
report states 
while many studies have focused on the psychological 
consequences for children in oneparent families few have looked 
at the longterm economics the report went on 
the two illinois researchers said they studied effects on 
education because it has been shown to be a predictor of welfare 
recipiency and persistent poverty and lack of education is one 
determinent of chronic unemployment 
beller and krein used a pair of longterm surveys to study two 
generations of mothers and their offspring totaling 2500 boys and 
girls 
in general the longer time spent in a singleparent family 
the greater the reduction in educational attainment they found 
the largest impact was among white males they reported with 
each year spent in a oneparent family reducing eventual education 
by about onetenth of a year 
white men who spent an average number of years 51 in a 
singleparent family completed 05 fewer years of schooling than 
those who spent none white men who spent all 18 years in a 
singleparent family completed 17 fewer years of schooling they 
found 
black males on average spent 8 years in a oneparent 
situation and received 06 year less schooling than those who 
spent their entire childhood in a twoparent home black males 
spending 18 years with just one parent finished 13 fewer years of 
school 
the impact was much less significant for women indeed for 
white women time spent in a singleparent family had no impact on 
eventual education the impact was slight for black women 
this suggests room for a powerful rolemodel effect of the 
working mother reported krein and beller 
a followup study not yet published found that the effect of 
the missing parent is reduced although not eliminated in cases 
where the father pays child support beller added 
in these cases though the father may not be present he still 
serves as a good role model and that affects educational 
attainment in a positive direction 
the greatest impact on eventual education was among youngsters 
whose preschool years were spent in oneparent families the study 
said it suggested that since the preschool years matter most 
affordable daycare with an educational component could replace 
some of the functions of the absent parent 
living in a family with brothers and sisters thus reducing the 
time available for the parent to concentrate on any one child 
also reduced eventual educational attainment beller and krein 
found again the effect was most pronounced among boys 
factors the researchers found to boost educational attainment 
were higher family income amount of reading materials in the home 
and the mothers education the fathers education appeared to be a 
factor among whites but not blacks they added

the democrats preconvention pace accelerated today as the 
party named texas state treasurer ann richards to be the 
conventions keynote speaker and as apparent presidential nominee 
michael dukakis scheduled a quick trip to washington to talk with 
senators about a running mate 
the choice of ms richards to give the nationally televised 
address was announced at a news conference in washington earlier 
dukakis aides said the senators with whom hell meet on wednesday 
will include several mentioned as possible vice presidential 
candidates 
one possible source of friction at the party convention eased 
when dukakis rival jesse jackson praised a proposed platform worked 
out in denver 
the developments came as a new poll indicated that dukakis is 
continuing to run well ahead of vice president george bush the 
likely republican presidential nominee although it suggested there 
is plenty of room for voters to change their minds since dukakis is 
still a blank page to many 
bush was back in washington today after a oneday trip to 
columbus ohio where he singled out defense issues as a key 
battleground for the summer campaign dukakis was wrapping up a 
fourday vacation on nantucket 
the selection of ms richards as convention keynoter was said to 
have originated with party officials although the dukakis campaign 
embraced it 
ms richards is the first woman elected to statewide office in 
texas in 50 years and her selection is likely to be seen as a 
democratic effort to court not only womens votes but southern 
support as well 
dukakis press secretary mark gearan said the massachusetts 
governor had decided to delay by a day a scheduled campaign trip 
through the midwest in order to spend wednesday in private meetings 
with 30 or more senators on capitol hill but officials also said 
the massachusetts governor would spend part of his time talking 
with prospective running mates 
dukakis has said he hopes to make his decision before the 
convention opens on july 18 although aides dismissed published 
reports that an announcement could be made this weekend 
dukakis aides last week sent out requests for background 
information on several prospective running mates including jesse 
jackson sens sam nunn of georgia john glenn of ohio and bob 
graham of florida as well as house democratic leader tom foley of 
washington 
others mentioned as possible running mates include sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas and rep lee hamilton of indiana rep richard 
gephardt of missouri who sought the presidential nomination also 
has been mentioned 
the gallup poll released today showed dukakis with a 13point 
lead over bush 53 percent to 40 percent with 7 percent undecided 
the survey based on interviews with 3021 adults from may 1322 
had a margin of error of 2 percentage points its results were in 
line with a string of surveys putting dukakis edge at 10 points or 
more 
but the poll conducted for the times mirror corp also 
indicated that dukakis lead came more from voters negative 
feelings about bush than positive feelings about the democratic 
nomineetobe 
dukakis tried to keep his island sojourn nearly free of campaign 
business gearan said sunday the governor had not even talked by 
telephone with aides in denver where platform drafters were at 
work on a campaign manifesto 
the document that emerged conformed more closely to the wishes 
of the dukakis camp than those of the jackson forces 
jacksons calls for raising taxes on the rich freezing the 
pentagon budget pledging no first use of nuclear weapons and 
supporting a palestinian homeland were all turned aside 
still jackson said today on abctvs good morning america 
in some measure our mission is to find common ground in the 
committee structure 
where that cannot take place well take it to the floor and 
simply let the people air it out in the public he said however 
he added lets look at the plus side there is language in that 
platform about a pension fund a reinvestment plan thats a step 
in the right direction a commitment to fight drugs a commitment 
to a new sovietus approach to third world development a 
commitment to ending apartheid in southern africa 
and democratic rulemakers meeting saturday in washington 
agreed to an overhaul of party rules which jackson hailed as a 
victory for the people a victory for democracy 
under the agreement the number of super delegates to the 
1992 convention will be cut nearly in half and all the other 
delegates would be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion 
to public suppor 
during the primary season jackson bitterly criticized 
delegateselection rules complaining that his delegate total did 
not reflect his proportion of the popular vote 
bush was in washington today after a oneday trip to columbus 
ohio where he blamed congress for hampering the administrations 
drug war 
congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs 
but when it comes to law enforcement some of them go awol or 
absent without leave he told a police group 
the vice president told reporters traveling with him on air 
force two he would be spelling out foreign policy differences with 
dukakis on defense in particular he said a very serious debate 
has not yet been joined 
obviously he dukakis will have to join it he said i 
think i will come out well on that 
bush criticized dukakis calls for unilateral nuclear weapons 
cuts how do we defend if we eliminate these systems hes calling 
for he asked

a new airbus a320 which crashed and killed three 
passengers had flown too low when it made a pass during a 
demonstration flight at an air show in eastern france officials 
said monday 
the directorgeneral of the civil aviation authority daniel 
tennenbaum told a paris news conference that the air france jet 
flew at an altitude of 30 feet when it made a lowflying pass over 
an airfield near mulhouse sunday he said the determination came 
from a preliminary investigation of the crash 
fifty passengers were injured 
in the eastern french town of mulhouse state prosecutor jean 
volff also said the preliminary investigation of the crash showed 
the plane was flying too low 
the a320 passed at 30 feet altitude which is completely 
outside the technical norms when it is carrying passengers volff 
said 
tennenbaum said the fully computerized aircraft needed eight 
seconds to respond to the command of the pilot who because of the 
low altitude had only five seconds to maneuver the plane upward 
a spokesman for airbus industrie the aircrafts manufacturer 
said earlier there were indications that human error caused the 
crash sunday of the air france jet which was carrying 133 people 
but the president of the airlines pilots union said its engines 
may have failed to restart at the pilots command 
transport minister louis mermaz said nothing for the moment 
calls into question either the functioning of the aircraft or the 
big airbus project 
 
the narrowbodied airbus a320 developed by a european 
consortium over four years at a cost of 2 billion is the new 
entry in the commercial aircraft market and a jet advertised as the 
fastestselling plane in aircraft history it went into service in 
april 
the air france twinengine plane clipped some trees and plunged 
from about 60 feet into a forest at the end of the airfield in 
front of tv cameras and a crowd of about 1000 people attending the 
show the aircraft burned and sent a pillar of black smoke in the 
air 
only the planes red white and blue tail remained unscorched 
a control tower official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the jet appeared to lose power as it passed over the field in 
habsheim a village about 15 miles from the swiss border 
christian roger the pilots union president had said there 
were indications that the engines failed to restart at the 
pilots command 
unlike other planes he said connections from the controls to 
the engines are made through the computer and not directly by 
cables 
the newspaper lhumanite reported today that pilot michel 
asseline told a rescuer i wanted to increase the power but the 
aircraft did not respond 
jeanmarie schreiber a reporter for the newspaper lalsace who 
was aboard told the daily newspaper francesoir he felt a jolt 
when the plane started to climb after passing over the field 
then all of a sudden i had the feeling we had hit a pothole 
and i saw trees from the window he said 
one passenger roland schmitted said we were flying low and 
i was afraid there would be a catastrophe i am a pilot and i 
said to myself hes never going to make it over those trees 
he said passengers were able to get out after fire broke out 
because the crew put down the evacuation chutes almost immediately 
officials said 50 people required hospitalization and some were 
badly burned they said there was only a rudimentary passenger list 
and some aboard may have left the crash site without identifying 
themselves 
air france and british airways which each have two a320s 
temporarily grounded their planes as a precaution on monday 
however british airways said it will resume using the aircraft on 
tuesday saying i was satisified the plane is safe 
no american airline uses the a320 yet although egan 
minnbased northwest airlines has 100 of the planes on order and 
new yorkbased pan american world airways has 16 ordered with an 
option to buy 34 more 
in addition two us leasing companies have ordered the a320 
gatx air of san francisco has asked for 10 of them and 
international lease finance corp of beverly hills calif has 
three on order 
air france took delivery just thursday of the plane that crashed 
and flew it six times on saturday 
airbus a toulouse francebased consortium says it has more 
than 500 orders or letters of intent to purchase the a320 france 
britain west germany and spain are partners in airbus 
the french news agency agencefrance presse reported monday that 
the airbus 320 has had two serious electrical problems since april 
the first on the inaugural flight march 26 and the second june 23 
on a flight that was to have gone to amsterdam but did not depart 
the aircraft carries 168 people and consumes 40 percent less 
fuel than similar two or three engine jets 
it is the first civilian airliner equipped with a fully 
computerized flightcontrol system which the manufacturer says 
permits safer electronically controlled flight 
instead of the old control column in front of the pilot there 
is a pistolgrip side stick linked to five computers that 
modify and relay the pilots directions to wing and tail flaps 
in the event of total failure of the electrical flight control 
system and all computers the jet is equipped with a mechanical 
cable link to the tail that would allow the pilot to fly manually 
although with reduced maneuverablity 
the plane operates with a twoman flight crew earlier this 
year pilots and flight engineers of frances largest domestic 
carrier air inter called a series of protest strikes saying 
three crewmembers were needed for safety 
newspapers quoted romain kroes a union spokesman as saying 
sundays accident proved the necessity for a third person in the 
cockpit he said a flight engineer is needed to take over manual 
controls in case of failure of the electronic system of supplying 
the planes engines with fuel 
mermaz said both black boxes with flight data had been recovered 
and officials were studying them 
the government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said pilot asseline and copilot pierre mazieres were not injured 
and should be able to help investigators 
the plane had flown from paris and landed in mulhouse about 320 
miles to the east to take on additional passengers and was to 
circle mount blanc in the alps then return to paris via mulhouse

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken monday by the supreme court 
 
picketing 
 
the court gave communities nationwide broader power to ban 
picketing of private residences 
by a 63 vote the court said such bans do not necessarily 
violate freespeech rights 
the decision is a defeat for antiabortion activists who were 
barred from picketing a doctors home in the milwaukee suburb of 
brookfield wis 
the ruling could also represensetback for unions 
locked in labor disputes 
the case is frisby vs schultz 87168 
 
military ct a significant ontractor 
 
the court gave defense contractors important protection against 
lawsuits by people who accuse them of making defective equipment 
that causes death or injury 
the justices by a 54 vote refused to reinstate a 725000 
award to the family of a marine helicopter copilot who died in a 
1983 crash in the atlantic ocean near virginia beach va 
the case is boyle vs united technologies corp 86492 
 
searches 
 
the court loosened the requirements for law enforcement agents 
to first obtain court warrants before conducting searches on 
private property 
the justices split 43 in ruling that evidence initially 
discovered during an unlawful search sometimes may be used at trd to usher 
in the cashless society has instead 
given cash a fresh boost with the spread of automatic teller 
machines or atms 
in 1977 there were about 10000 atms around the country today 
the total exceeds 80000 
these machines are available to dispense cash to consumers at 
any time of day or night and their proliferation has doubtless 
changed the way many people go about spending and managing money 
banks have been quick to adopt atm systems in lieu of employing 
more human tellers as a way to lower their operating costs 
another incentive for banks to promote their atms walker says 
lies in their dealings with the federal reserve 
the fed charges banks a fee for wire transfer of funds and for 
processing checks but it imposes no such fee for its 
cashprocessing services 
the credit card has meanwhile been dealt a significant setback 
under tax reform the tax deduction for interest paid on consumer 
interest is being reduced in stages to zero by 1991 
of course many people pay their monthly creditcard balances in 
full so that they seldom or never incur interest charges there 
are also increasing numbers of debit cards with which purchases 
are processed just as if a check had been written 
still amid all the plastic and paper coin and currency 
continue to hold a prominent position concludes walker visions 
of a cashless society are likely to remain just that cold cash 
will be with us for some time to come

a jury today recommended that david j 
carpenter convicted of five northern california murders be 
executed in the gas chamber for the socalled trailside 
slayings 
carpenter 58 already has been sentenced to death for the 1981 
killings of two 20yearold women in santa cruz county parks

trails panicked outdoor enthusiasts and left the parks nearly empty 
of hikers for months

shootings

stowers 19 of petaluma anne alderson 26 san rafael diane 
oconnell 22 san jose and shauna may 25 san francisco 
superior court judge herbert hoffman scheduled a july 19 hearing 
for carpenters formal sentencing he can either follow the jurys 
recommendation or sentence carpenter to life imprisonment without 
possibility of parole 
the trial was moved to san diego because of pretrial publicity

childhood including physical and mental abuse and psychological 
problems mitigated circumstances in the killings 
jurors hearing the case in san diego were not told of previous 
convictions and sentence for the santa cruz murders of ellen marie 
hansen and heather scaggs 
the santa cruz case was heard in los angeles superior court in 
1984 on a change of venue also granted because of heavy publicity

the securities and exchange commission today 
charged an analyst with morgan stanley group inc with profiting 
from inside information in what an sec official called the second 
biggest insider trading case the agency has ever handled 
the sec filed a civil complaint against stephen wang jr an 
analyst in morgan stanleys mergers and acquisitions department 
the complaint asked the federal court in new york to order the 
return of 19 million in alleged trading profits plus triple that 
amount in damages 
gary lynch the secs enforcement chief said the case is the 
second biggest insider trading case ever handled by the sec 
dwarfed only by a case brought in late 1986 against ivan boesky 
also named in the complaint was fred c lee a hong kong 
businessman who allegedly traded on the information supplied by 
wang 
wang had been with morgan stanley for two years and had been in 
the mergers and acquisition division for one year lynch said in an 
interview 
over the course of the last year we allege that he funnelled 
information to fred lee who then traded on that information 
lynch said 
investigators alleged in the complaint that lee had attempted to 
move money out of the united states and for that reason funds in 
bank accounts should be frozen 
lynch said that investigators are alleging that the trading on 
inside information involved stock in about 25 different companies 
including ef hutton stop amp shop cos and utah power amp light co 
morgan stanley said in a brief statement that it had suspended 
wang pending an investigation a source at morgan stanley who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said the firm had been cooperating 
with sec officials for some time in connection with wangs 
activities 
wang 24 was a junior analyst on a twoyear training program 
for college graduates the source said he was only months away 
from completing the program when the sec announced its action 
against him 
the sec complaint against boesky was filed in november 1986 
boesky paid the sec a record 100 million to settle civil charges 
that he traded stocks on the basis of insider information provided 
to him by dennis b levine a former investment banker at drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
both boesky and levine are serving sentences in minimum security 
federal prisons 
the sec complaint against wang and lee who is a taiwan citizen 
comes after a house investigating committee charged earlier in the 
month that the sec was not doing enough to pursue insider trading 
by foreigners 
a subcommittee of the house government operations committeee had 
charged that insider trading by foreigners was growing as traders 
became more sophisticated in cloaking their identity by purchasing 
us stock through overseas banks 
but sec chairman david ruder had defended his agencys handling 
of investigations involving foreigners saying the sec had made 
substantial progress in coordinating investigations with other 
countries

the state department expressed outrage monday 
over mexicos release of a puerto rican nationalist wanted in the 
united states for terrorist activities 
william morales 37 was released from prison late last week 
after serving five years of an eightyear term for the murder of a 
mexican policeman mexican officials said he also was granted 
political asylum 
morales was reportedly released after mexican foreign secretary 
bernardo sepulveda rejected a us request for his extradition on 
the ground he was a political fighter for the independence of 
puerto rico who had been politically persecuted 
state department spokesman charles e redman who indicated that 
the united states had not been informed officially of morales 
release said allowing him to go free would be a serious blow to 
international efforts to combat terrorism 
he said morales was implicated in a 1975 plane bombing in new 
york in which four people were killed and 60 injured and has been 
sentenced to over 100 years in prison in the united states on 
weapons possession charges 
we are outraged and surprised by reports that mexican 
authorities may have released mr morales redman said 
morales was arrested in new york in 1978 after a bomb he was 
making detonated blowing off most of both hands and disfiguring 
his face he escaped from us custody a year later 
he was said to be a leader of a puerto rican independence group 
called the armed forces of national liberation 
morales was arrested by mexican authorities in 1983 after a 
shootout with police in which a companion and a mexican policeman 
were killed he received an eightyear prison term 
redman said us officials have been told that morales has been 
turned over to the mexican secretariat of government which will 
decide his eventual disposition 
he said the administration is trying to clarify reports that 
mexico may grant morales political asylum 
we would be deeply disturbed that an individual with morales 
record of criminal behavior a convicted felon in both our 
countries should even be considered for possible political refugee 
status redman said

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will give a 
lengthy report at tuesdays longawaited communist party 
conference delegates said but they cautioned against expecting 
major changes or shifts in the party elite 
the heads of delegations streaming into moscow from each of the 
soviet unions 15 republics and from the dozens of regions of the 
sprawling russian republic huddled to decide who will sit on the 
key steering bodies of the first conference of its kind in 47 years 
officials have said the presidium directing the conference will 
decide which of the 5000 delegates gets to speak at the forum 
expected to last at least until july 1 
viktor g afanasyev editor of the communist party daily 
newspaper pravda said gorbachev would deliver a big and 
interesting report after the delegates gather in the kremlins 
modern glass and marble palace of congresses on tuesday 
but one delegate who has seen the party chiefs speech said 
privately there would be no surprises and that gorbachev would 
follow the broad outlines set earlier by the partys policymaking 
central committee 
gorbachev announced in january 1987 that he wanted to call a 
general conference the first since 1941 and only the 19th in 
communist party history for months afterward officials and 
reformers suggested that radical changes would be decided at the 
forum which was seen as a watershed for the kremlins new policies 
slogans fluttering all over moscow talk of a revolutionary 
change and officials insist the conference will help make 
gorbachevs perestroika or restructuring irreversible 
but they concede it is unlikely that some of the most radical 
reforms proposed in weeks of fervent discussion in the staterun 
media will be approved at the conference 
there is a lot of waiting for a miracle said otto latsis a 
conference delegate and deputy editor of the monthly journal 
kommunist but you cant expect that the day after the 
conference we will wake up in paradise 
latsis comments reflected a general effort by party officials 
and reforms in recent days to play down expectations that the 
conference would fundamentally change the course of society 
diplomats and other foreign analysts suggested the tactic was 
intended to make any gains gorbachev does make for his reform 
policy appear as a significant strengthening of his leadership 
position 
latsis said the forum wont decide on specifics of economic 
policy but will concentrate on uniting the party behind a new 
definition of the communists role in soviet society 
the original proposals for the conference known as theses were 
published last month after being approved by the central committee 
on may 23 
the theses contained a few specific proposals for reform such 
as limiting office holders to a maximum of two fiveyear terms in 
any one post and a much broader but more vague program to 
dismantle the remnants of the authoritarian rule of josef v stalin 
the stalinist past is likely to be a topic of discussion as the 
party tries to determine its role following gorbachevs calls for 
communists to withdraw from daytoday administration and play a 
more political role in setting general goals for society 
echoing soviet founder vladimir i lenins slogan of all power 
to the soviets the theses suggest that the power of the local 
governing councils known as soviets should be strengthened 
latsis told reporters he believed workers in the party apparatus 
should be barred from election to the councils in an effort to 
divide power and increase the accountability of the communist party 
but more conservative voices have insisted the party must keep 
firm control over all aspects of society as it has for most of the 
70 years since the 1917 revolution 
some reformers had predicted the conference would elect a new 
central committee enabling gorbachev to weed out oldtimers and 
install younger more dynamic figures on the policysetting body 
yuri a sklyarov head of the central committees propaganda 
department said monday however that the election of new central 
committee members is not on the conference agenda 
there are 60 to 70 dead souls among the 300plus members on 
the central committee dead souls are those who have either 
died or lost the jobs that entitled them to seats since the last 
central committee was elected in 1986 
sklyarov suggested thursday that new members might join the key 
body but he and another central committee official georgy 
kryuchkov said monday there was no reason why people who had 
retired from previous posts should lose their central committee 
seats now

president reagan on monday reiterated his 
faith in the innocence of former aides oliver l north and john m 
poindexter and said he expects they would be exonerated if tried 
during a photo session with visiting turkish president kenan 
evren reagan was asked if he favored speeding up the 
declassification of documents considered necessary for the trials 
of north and poindexter 
well i hope that we could he replied 
i believe in the innocence of the two men and i would like to 
see that established once and for all 
the white house had said last week that it favored legal 
proceedings in the irancontra case going forward but said the 
question of setting a trial date is up to the judge and the 
prosecutors 
reagan has refused to say whether he would grant pardons to 
north and poindexter former national security council aides ousted 
in november 1986 amid revelations that proceeds from secret arms 
sales to iran had been diverted to the nicaraguan contra rebels

a sharply divided supreme court ruled monday 
that defense contractors enjoy broad protection from lawsuits when 
defective equipment they sell to the government causes death and 
injury 
the ruling was denounced by dissenting justices as a 
breathtakingly farreaching grant of immunity to the nations 
defense industry they also accused the court of unlawfully 
usurping congressional power and said the ruling seems to apply as 
well to nonmilitary contractors 
by a 54 vote the court refused to reinstate a 725000 award 
to the family of a marine helicopter copilot who died in a 1983 
crash in the atlantic ocean near virginia beach va 
the ruling coming at a time when pentagon contracting is under 
extraordinary scrutiny marks the first time the justices have 
extended broad legal protection to companies that supply military 
equipment 
the ruling is not related to the current federal investigation 
into alleged fraud and bribery in military procurement 
the court said a contractor is protected from suit when it makes 
equipment conforming to reasonably precise pentagon 
specifications and the company warns the government about any 
potential dangers of which it is aware 
the ruling also could be a help to morton thiokol manufacuturer 
of the booster rockets for the space shuttle challenger a leaking 
seal on one of the booster rockets was blamed for the jan 28 
1986 challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts 
the company has reached a 7735000 settlement with four of the 
astronauts families in which it contributed 60 percent and the 
government 40 percent of the money 
justice antonin scalia in his opinion for the court monday 
said shielding government contractors from suit is a vital public 
concern 
if a company may be sued easily either the contractor will 
decline to manufacture the design specified by the government or it 
will raise its prices either way the interests of the united 
states will be directly affected scalia said 
we are of the view that state law which holds government 
contractors liable for design defects in military equipment does in 
some circumstances present a significant conflict with federal 
policy and must be displaced he said 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion said the 
courts newly discovered government contractor defense is 
breathtakingly sweeping 
he said this court lacks both authority and expertise to 
fashion the guidelines set by scalia the constitution demands that 
job be left to congress brennan said 
he also said the ruling could apply to nonmilitary contractors 
for example he said a company that designs a government building 
may be immune from suit when the elevator cable snaps or the 
walls collapse 
the court previously has ruled that members of the armed 
services may not sue the government over injuries suffered in 
connection with the military service 
mondays ruling appears to give military contractors even more 
extensive legal protection in some cases for example scalia said 
the manufacturer of a jet engine ordered by the government should 
be protected from being sued by civilians who say the engine is 
needlessly noisy 
mondays case stemmed from a federal jury award of 725000 to 
the family of david boyle who drowned april 27 1983 in the crash 
of a sikorsky ch53 helicopter 
boyle survived the crash impact but he was unable to force his 
hatch to open against the pressure of the water 
his family said the design was defective because the hatch 
should have opened inward to permit pilots to escape 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in may 1986 threw out the 
jury award against the helicopter manufacturer sikorsky aircraft 
and its parent company united technologies corp the appeals court 
said sikorsky relied upon the navys design 
the supreme court sent the case back to the 4th circuit court 
but only to restudy a narrow issue 
the justices said the appeals court ruling will stand unless the 
appeals court improperly acted as a trial court and decided itself 
that the facts of the case established the military contractor 
defense 
joining scalia were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor and anthony m 
kennedy the dissenters besides brennan were justices thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens

the nations largest organization of doctors 
began debate monday on a wide range of aids proposals including 
recommendations for testing the nations prison population and for 
states to trace the sex partners of infected people 
the proposals were part of a main report and four background 
papers approved by the board of trustees of the american medical 
association and set for action by the 420member house of delegates 
representing 295000 doctors before its annual policymaking 
convention ends thursday 
included in the ama boards proposals are recommendations that 
the nation expand treatment programs for intravenous drug 
abusers because they pose the most explosive potential for 
spreading the deadly disease into the heterosexual population 
us women infected with the aids virus avoid breast feeding to 
reduce the chance of giving the disease to their children 
vigorous enforcement of existing antidiscrimination laws to 
protect aids victims 
the president to create a new national aids commission 
identical to the one that recently finished its work to provide 
the essential coordination between public and private institutions 
that are addressing aids 
this is a disease we cant become casual about said dr 
john dawson an ama trustee and a surgeon from seattle were 
still waiting for the explosion of cases that will arouse the 
country 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys ability 
to fight disease and is spread primarily through sexual 
intercourse shared hypodermic needles and from breastfeeding 
mothers to their infants it is fatal and incurable 
by 1991 the nation likely will have 270000 cases of aids the 
report said affirming previous estimates by other groups 
in 1986 148060 people were tested in the united states for 
infection by the aids virus and 22775 or 154 percent tested 
positive the main report said preliminary results for 1987 showed 
that 623493 people were tested and 17629 or 28 percent tested 
positive 
the report attributed the drop in positive tests to the opening 
of new testing centers in areas with a low prevalence of aids 
the ama board recommended that all states without contact 
tracing seriously consider launching such programs in an effort to 
slow the diseases spread among heterosexuals 
you have the potential for a frightening expansion of aids 
into the heterosexual community dawson said thats where 
contact tracing would be important 
but the ama acknowledges that legal or other issues may block 
such programs dawson added 
the report also reaffirms the amas call for mandatory aids 
testing of all prison inmates because of the high prevalence of 
infection among them 
however the amas proposed policy calls on prisons to take 
steps to protect the confidentiality of aidsinfected prisoners 
several delegates and health officials spoke against the 
proposal monday saying it wouldnt serve any purpose unless 
aidsinfected inmates were segregated from other prisoners and that 
testing may be too costly 
a report focusing on intravenous drug abusers recommends that 
federal and state governments increase funding for free drug 
treatment programs but stopped short of calling for providing drug 
addicts access to clean uncontaminated needles as some countries 
have begun doing

a federal judge monday approved a settlement 
of a desegregation case that will use new attendance boundaries and 
magnet schools to promote integration but does not include 
busing 
the plan also calls for immediate repairs to innercity schools 
with predominately black enrollments 
i see no legal objection to what has been submitted to the 
court i wish the parties well you dont know how i wish the 
parties well said us district judge w brevard hand in 
approving the proposal for the mobile county school system 
with that the judge ended a 15minute hearing and set into 
motion a fiveyear program geared toward racial equality 
the mobile county system alabamas largest has about 65000 
students in the city of mobile and mobile county which together 
have a population of 350000 enrollment in the school district is 
about 44 percent black 
the desegregation case known as the birdie mae davis lawsuit 
was filed 25 years ago by a group of black parents miss davis was 
a pupil at the time 
the agreement worked out by the parties in the case calls for 
strict adherence to new attendance zones and the creation of more 
magnet schools such schools offer courses in special fields such 
as the arts or sciences and are designed to draw students from 
throughout the district 
the plan does not include busing of students 
the mobile county school board last week unanimously approved 
the agreement 
its the beginning of the end of the case james u 
blacksher the attorney for the plaintiffs said monday the school 
system remains under court jurisdiction however until the 
agreement is carried out 
over the years the school system had presented various 
desegregation proposals to the court some of which were carried 
out but none had received court approval 
if we can carry out whats in the agreement were going to 
have a beautiful school system said robert gilliard school 
board president and head of the local chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
under the plan buildings will be renovated including immediate 
repairs to predominately black blount high school which would have 
been torn down under an earlier proposal blacks led a community 
drive to save the school 
school superintendent billy salter said the school system has 
10 million available to begin the renovations required by the 
court those funds were set aside for planned construction of a 
high school that is no longer required under the settlement

the traditionalist movement of archbishop marcel 
lefebvre on monday challenged the vaticans warning that lefebvre 
will be automatically excommunicated if he consecrates four bishops 
without papal approval 
the consecration scheduled for thursday at a seminary in econe 
switzerland would lead to the first schism in the roman catholic 
church in more than a century 
in a letter to the media the director of the econe seminary 
cited a german expert on canon law that no sanctions can be applied 
by the church against the faithful who act in an emergency 
the rev alain lorans said in the letter it was wrong to claim 
that the code inflicts this punishment automatically without taking 
into account certain cases of emergency 
lorans cited passages from a book published in 1984 by georg 
may a professor at the university of mainz who wrote that an 
emergency situation justifies emergency rights 
those rights can only be claimed if all possibilities to 
restore the normal situation by positive valid law have been 
exhausted may wrote in an emergency situation the pastors of 
the church can take extraordinary measures to protect or restore 
the activity of the church 
the rev roland trauffer secretary of the swiss conference on 
bishops and an expert on canon law confirmed that canon law 
provides immunity for those breaking it in an emergency 
but it is wrong to claim that lefebvre acts in a state of 
emergency trauffer told the associated press in an interview 
an emergency is something unforeseeable something that occurs 
suddenly without warning and in which the person concerned has no 
possibility to communicate with the pope 
lefebvres plan to consecrate bishops was announced last year 
it is to ensure the continuity of the church that he says is 
threatened by neoprotestantism and other autodestructive 
trends since the second vatican council 196265 
the 82yearold prelate has been suspended from his priestly and 
episcopal functions since 1976 for his campaign against the 
conciliar reforms especially against new guidelines on religious 
freedom and more contacts with other faiths in defiance of this 
ban he has ordained more than 200 priests and has scheduled 16 
more ordinations at econe on wednesday on the eve of the 
consecration of the four bishops

miles south of san jose along the san andreas fault the time was

a former politburo protege of the late soviet 
leader leonid i brezhnev is partly to blame for grave ethnic 
problems plaguing the southern republics of azerbaijan and armenia 
a communist party official said monday 
vyacheslav a mikhailov a party central committee specialist on 
the soviet unions more than 100 ethnic groups also said ethnic 
armenians are ignoring appeals to end a strike they began more than 
a month ago 
mikhailov spoke at a news conference on how ethnic problems will 
figure in the 19th communist party conference a meeting of 5000 
delegates convening tuesday in moscow to review soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs policies 
he said the demands of armenians living in nagornokarabakh to 
take their region out of azerbaijan and annex it to the armenian 
republic resulted from years of inattention to their cultural 
historical and social concerns he singled out geidar a aliev a 
brezhnev protege who was party chief of azerbaijan from 1969 to 
1982 and his successor kyamran m bagirov 
those mistakes were made by the leadership of azerbaijan both 
by the party and govermental authorities including the first 
secretary of the republic aliev and first secretary of azerbaijan 
comrade bagirov much damage has been done and really grave 
damage mikhailov said 
the criticism put aliev even further into disgrace he was 
retired from the ruling politburo on oct 21 1987 ostensibly for 
health reasons but under a cloud of poor performance in the 
industries he oversaw the previous blow was thursday when the 
azerbaijani party decided to turn a mansion aliev had built for 
brezhnev in baku the republics capital into a wedding palace 
aliev who headed the azerbaijan kgb was chosen a candidate 
member of the politburo in 1976 and was brezhnevs last appointment 
to full politburo status in 1982 although brezhnev died before 
alievs selection could be fully ratified the new soviet leader 
yuri andropov could not overturn brezhnevs decision and aliev 
was made a member of the politburo at the end of november 1982 
according to soviet historian roy medvedev 
bagirov also has lost his job on may 21 he and armenian party 
chief karen demirchyan were retired officially for health reasons 
but most likely for mishandling the ethnic unrest 
the moscow government approved a package of housing and social 
services improvements for nagornokarabakh in march but has yet to 
review the annexation demand moscow party officials have already 
rejected the demand 
armenians in nagornokarabakh began a strike and street 
demonstrations may 23 to demand their region be taken out of 
azerbaijan residents voted at a public meeting in 
nagornokarabakhs main city stepanakert on saturday to end the 
strike which has cost at least 50 million in economic losses 
soviet media have reported but mikhailov said the walkout was 
continuing 
today the leaders of nagornokarabakh launched a campaign 
among the working people of the region so as to stop strikes and to 
resume the normal rhythm of work and to resolve the problem we 
didnt have any definite results as a matter of fact through 
today he said 
telephone calls to stepanakert did not go through monday an 
operator said communications to the region were disrupted 
the legislature of armenia voted earlier this month to endorse 
annexation of nagornokarabakh but azerbaijans legislature 
refused to give its consent 
mikhailov said a plenary meeting of the central partys 300plus 
member central committee would be held within a year to discuss the 
problems of the soviet unions nationalities gorbachev has said 
the problems are among the most severe facing the country 
in another development mikhailov disclosed monday that four 
more azerbaijanis had been convicted in the ethnic rioting in 
february in the azerbaijani city of sumgait thirtytwo people 26 
armenians and six azerbaijanis were killed and 200 people were 
injured mikhailov did not say when the four had been convicted or 
give the charges soviet officials have said more than 80 people 
have been charged in the case

the environmental protection agency has found 
tanks lined with lead solder in eight of 12 water coolers 
manufactured by a company that said it had never used lead tanks or 
leadlined tanks according to documents made available by a 
congressional source 
water from one of the tanks was contaminated with lead 40 times 
the current epa drinking water standard and 100 times the 
standard expected to be adopted later this year 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the health and 
environment subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee last week asked te company halsey taylor of freeport 
ill to recall the coolers to repair or replace the tanks 
the environmental protection agency testing water coolers from 
two navy installations in maryland last year found high 
concentrations of lead in their water 
this discovery led to a survey of manufacturers by the 
subcommittee which estimated in february that close to a million 
tanks had lead solder in their plumbing connections 
several models of halsey taylor coolers used lead solder on 
connections between 1978 and late last year but president robert 
a hoagland wrote waxman in january that the company never 
designed or manufactured a water cooler that used a leadlined 
or lead tank 
of 22 tanks provided by the navy for testing 12 were made by 
halsey taylor and eight had tanks lined with lead solder according 
to a letter from michael cook head of the water office at epa to 
a company official 
halsey taylor a subsidiary of household international inc 
inspected 14000 coolers in 1979 repairing many with pinhole leaks 
that had permitted solder to get inside 
cook said he did not know why solder would be used for a lining 
its conceivable the tanks had similar leaks but it doesnt 
look like it the solder is in a uniform layer inside cook said 
the solder is 50 percent lead and 50 percent other metals he 
said epa has offered to provide parts of the tank for the company 
to test and is awaiting a response he said 
the companys director of marketing tom klein said he believed 
cooks assessment was wrong the tanks in question probably came 
from the 1979 batch and might easily have developed a uniform 
coating inside klein said 
we are not hiding our head in the sand we are cooperating 
with congressman waxman said klein 
one of the tanks provided a sample containing 2000 parts per 
billion of lead according to cooks letter the maximum 
permissible lead concentration is 50 parts per billion and epa 
expects to lower that to 20 parts per billion 
two coolers with solderlined tanks were missing identification 
tags the other six carried model numbers wt8a gc10a and gc10acr 
according to cooks letter 
lead is a poison that in high enough concentrations can damage 
the brain and other organs children are particularly vulnerable 
because their brains are still developing 
until 1986 solder used on copper pipes in homes contained lead 
and many older cities have lead pipes in their water systems 
people should not be preoccupied with water coolers said 
cook in addition to all the other possible sources he said we 
have increasing evidence that brass fittings in homes do contribute 
lead in the very first water you get when turn on the tap after it 
has been idle 
epa has estimated that 42 million americans use tap water 
containing lead above 20 ppb of which 38 million are children 
under age 6 an estimated 241000 children under 6 are getting 
enough lead to harm them the agency estimates 
rep gerry sikorski dminn planned to introduce a bill today 
requiring epa to help schools test and renovate water systems 
contaminated by lead forbidding the sale of leadcontaining 
coolers and requiring manufacturers to recall any previously sold 
and forcing epa to make the new standard 10 ppb instead of 20 ppb 
the water test corp of manchester nh wrote waxman it would 
test samples without charge for schools that request it schools 
would have to get sample bottles from the company and pay shipping 
charges

some colleges in california are handing 
out small pledge cards along with diplomas asking graduates to 
consider the ethical implications of their careers 
at humboldt state university andrea pickart picked up her degree 
but politely declined the card and walked on 
her boyfriend peter jain also graduated at the may 14 
ceremony he signed the graduation pledge of environmental and 
social responsibility as soon as he got it 
no one wants to go on record against ethical behavior but 
detractors feel the cards are unnecessary or an invasion of the 
tradition of graduation 
politically and philosophically i feel the pledges are 
responsible but i didnt feel any need to sign it my own 
convictions are strong enough to ensure that my employment is 
socially and politically responsible said pickart who holds a 
masters degree in biology works for a nature group and is a 
member of 10 environmental groups 
but jain who received a bachelors degree in music says he 
looked at the pledge as an acknowledgement of the greater 
consideration of the work you are doing 
signing the card the graduate pledges to thoroughly 
investigate and take into account the social and environmental 
consequences of any job opportunity i consider 
the pledges were included in this years graduation ceremonies 
at seven west coast colleges and universities including humboldt 
state university of californiasanta cruz and stanford where 
president donald kennedy praised the pledge as something that 
should be as acceptable to the politically conservative as to the 
liberal 
some graduates have signed them publicly others have taken them 
home for further consideration and at least one has torn his up in 
protest 
a reality of the world is that literally every single action 
that we take has consequenses on the world around us not just on 
ourselves said matt nicodemus a selfdescribed fulltime 
peace activist who helped start the movement at humboldt state 
last year 
were asking people to look closely at as many of the 
consequenses as they can identify and look at personal values once 
youve found those use them as your ethical and political 
yardstick 
we want them to know it is possible to investigate the 
consequences he added in the past that has not been the 
norm were saying we think it would be a good idea if that became 
the norm 
some opponents say the pledge is coercive others believe 
including the pledge in graduation ceremonies erodes tradition 
the most vocal opponent at humboldt is recent graduate david 
lofink as a student government representative last semester he 
vowed to tear up the pledge during the ceremony 
i think i hugged my mother first and then i tore it up 
lofink said 
he said hes concerned the university will have difficulty 
turning down similar requests from other groups 
when does it stop once youve let one group come in with 
their idea on a pledge when do you say no he said most 
students are indifferent my philosophy is that most want to get 
through college out the door and on to a job

more than 2000 opponents of the ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini staged a rally and march monday to mark the 
seventh anniversary of their groups expulsion from iran and to 
celebrate a recent military victory along the iraniraq border 
two members of congress addressed the noisy rally across the 
street from the white house terming the peoples mujahedeen of 
iran a legitimate exiled opposition movement and comparing them to 
freedom fighters the united states supports elsewhere in the 
world 
there is no question in my mind yours is a just cause said 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif a member of the house foreign 
affairs committee dymally said he is trying to build diplomatic 
and political support for the group which is conducting its own 
war against the khomeini regime 
a crowd that police estimated at 2700 held neatly printed 
banners condemning khomeini and bearing photos of the resistance 
movements leaders massoud and maryam rajavi 
rep donald lukens rohio also spoke to the group and told a 
reporter he sees the organization as a force to establish democracy 
in iran he said he had not even heard of the group until six 
months ago but had since become persuaded of its legitimacy 
the united states is officially neutral in the eightyear war 
between iran and iraq and in the past has labeled the mujahedeen a 
terrorist organization that criticism has been moderated in recent 
months however and there have been stafflevel contacts between 
the state department and the opposition group 
at a press briefing before the rally the groups international 
affairs secretary moshen rezai said the capture last week of the 
iranian city of mehran by antikhomeini troops marked a military 
political and social turning point in its struggle 
he said the groups national liberation army of iran had 
inflicted 8000 casualties in four days of fighting taken 1500 
prisoners and seized or destroyed 2 billion in weapons rezai 
said rebel troops had taken 44 tanks and some usmade antitank 
and antiaircraft missiles 
the town of mehran itself has little strategic value and 
virtually no civilian population and was only lightly defended by 
khomeinis troops but the victory was seen as having political 
significance as one in a string of recent defeats for the iranian 
regime 
rezai denied that his organization is funded by iraq saying 
iraq provides only sanctuary for the rebels along their border with 
iran he declined to say how many rebel troops are under arms 
press reports have put the groups strength at about 10000 
he said the group was not seeking military backing from the 
united states but was pressing for adoption of a broad embargo on 
purchase of iranian oil and an international embargo on weapons 
sales to iran

a puerto rican separatist who is wanted in 
the united states for terrorist activities has been released from 
prison and sent to cuba the mexican government said monday 
william morales was flown to cuba on friday after completing 
five years of his eightyear sentence said interior department 
spokesman octavio campos 
the us embassy in mexico city said the us government was 
outraged and surprised by reports that mexican authorities may 
have released william morales whom we understand had several years 
left to serve on mexican homicide and attempted murder charges 
the statement from campos which did not provide further 
details was the first confirmation of morales whereabouts since 
reports surfaced this weekend that morales 37 had been released 
from prison 
reports in the leftist newspapers la jornada and uno mas uno 
which have been following the morales case closely said morales 
was released from prison friday and turned over to the custody of 
federal interior department immigration agents 
the united states wanted him extradited to serve out a prison 
sentence on weapons and explosives charges but mexico decided 
earlier this month that his was a political case not covered by the 
extradition treaty prevailing between the two nations 
the united states would be deeply disturbed that an individual 
with morales record of criminal behavior a convicted felon in 
both countries should even be considered for possible political 
refugee status the us embassy statement said 
the us government already expressed our displeasure to the 
government of mexico over the foreign ministrys decision not to 
extradite morales to the united states it said allowing him 
to go free would be a serious blow to international efforts to 
combat terrorism and an affront to usmexican relations 
state department spokesman charles e redman said morales was 
implicated in a 1975 bombing in new york in which four people were 
killed and 60 injured and has been sentenced to over 100 years in 
prison in the united states on weapons possession charges 
morales was arrested in new york in 1978 after a bomb he was 
making detonated blowing off most of both hands and disfiguring 
his face he escaped from us custody a year later 
us officials say morales is a leader of the puerto rican 
independence group the armed forces of national liberation or 
faln 
morales escaped from the prison ward of bellevue hospital in new 
york city a month after he was sentenced to a 29 to 89year prison 
term on state charges and up to 10 years in prison on federal 
charges 
he made his way to mexico where he was taken into custody in 
1983 he was sentenced for his role in the death of one policeman 
and the wounding of another on may 26 1983 near the central city 
of puebla and for entering mexico illegally 
the foreign ministrys decision granting him political asylum 
was announced earlier in june 
morales said in an interview with the associated press from 
prison at that time that the decision was a political recognition 
of our fight for independence 
la jornadas original report on the mexican government decision 
quoted a resolution signed by foreign minister bernardo sepulveda 
as concluding that morales did not arrive at producing harm to 
society or any individuals in particular except those he inflicted 
upon himself 
a foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the report

in honor of the former president a former habitat board member who 
will join the workers for the final three days it is the groups 
largest project yet 
young also a congregationist minister proclaimed it habitat 
for humanity week and led the crew in an impromptu rendition of 
when the roll is called up yonder 
you bring with you the spirit and love of god and a concern 
for the least of these gods children young told the

southeast atlanta donated by the city supporting the 400odd 
construction workers are another 800 volunteers handling a variety 
of chores

neighborhood by 1989 and 25 more homes by 1990 in another 
neighborhood habitat for humanity is working to raise 15 million 
for the first 50 homes in the atlanta project 
young recalled that he and his wife jean were able to buy a

a plan by the american medical association to 
expand the governments medicaid health insurance program to cover 
27 million more poor people is laudable but may be unaffordable 
says one official 
the report issued at the amas policymaking convention 
recommends that medicaid be expanded to cover 27 million more poor 
people the federalstate program now serves about 19 million poor 
elderly blind and disabled 
members of the amas house of delegates are expected to act on 
the report during the convention which runs monday through 
thursday 
the medicaid program is totally inadequate to address the 
problem of uninsured and underinsured people in the united 
states said dr william hotchkiss outgoing ama president as 
physicians we feel we must take the position of advocates for 
making health care available to all lowincome people 
the report proposes a massive overhaul of the medicaid program 
at an estimated annual cost of 24 billion it calls for expanding 
medicaid to provide coverage for medical care to an estimated 27 
million people who are living at or below the poverty level but not 
receiving government healthcare benefits 
at 1988 spending levels the amas proposal would raise 
medicaids cost from 52 billion to 76 billion but it doesnt 
recommend how to pay for the increase 
i think its a laudable attempt by the ama to address the 
issue of how we provide medical care to the poor and working poor 
of our country said dean schott a spokesman for the illinois 
department of public aid which administers the program in this 
state 
but the ama i think has an obligation to also suggest how 
this program would be funded do we raise taxes to pay for it do 
we shift money from one program to another schott said sunday 
the ama study found that an estimated 60 percent of us 
residents whose incomes are below the national poverty level dont 
qualify for medicaid because the eligibility standards vary widely 
between states 
to reduce these inequities the ama proposes creating uniform 
national standards of eligibility and uniform payments for medical 
care 
when the federal goverment established medicaid in 1965 it 
failed to set uniform standards and any changes in the program 
would require its approval 
without national standards the program has evolved into a 
patchwork quilt with a wide variation in benefits among the 
states said dr robert mcafee an ama trustee and a surgeon from 
portland maine 
to qualify for medicaid in 1986 for example a family of three 
who received welfare could have an income of no more than 1416 in 
alabama but in alaksa the maximum income is 8800 the ama report 
said

left central cambodia on monday as part of what vietnam says will 
be its largest troop withdrawal since it invaded cambodia nearly a 
decade ago 
the vietnamese troops boarded trucks and headed south from 
kompong chhnang toward the capital phnom pehn local officials 
said 
the officials said the pullout left only 200 vietnamese soldiers 
in kompong chhnang a central province away from the main 
battlefields along cambodias border with thailand they said the 
remaining troops would leave oct 25 
vietnam announced in may it would withdraw 50000 troops from 
neighboring cambodia by the end of the year beginning in june it 
also said all of its estimated 120000 troops would be gone by 
1990 leaving the fighting to the forces of the phnom penh 
government it installed after the 1978 invasion 
the vietnamese have been fighting a coalition of guerrilla 
forces in cambodia that includes the communist khmer rouge the 
noncommunist khmer peoples party and followers of former leader 
prince norodom sihanouk 
vietnamese authorities have said they plan to fly their entire 
military command in cambodia from phnom penh to ho chi minh city

rightwing cabinet minister 
ariel sharon demanded monday that palestinian firebombers be 
eliminated and arabs involved in violent antiisraeli protests 
be deported 
sharon the trade and industry minister toured this jewish 
settlement to inaugurate four industrial plants ariel with a 
population of 8000 is about 19 miles north of jerusalem 
sharon has been leading a chorus of political hardliners and 
jewish settlers who insist on tougher army action to quell the 
6monthold arab uprising in the israelioccupied territories 
a terrorist should be eliminated people throwing molotov 
cocktails firebombs should be eliminated people who are involved 
in violence should be expelled from the country said sharon a 
former defense minister who engineered israels 1982 invasion of 
lebanon 
he would not elaborate when asked what he meant by 
eliminated 
sharon and others have repeatedly denounced defense minister 
yitzhak rabin and stepped up their criticism last week after an 
israeli farmer was bludgeoned to death and a jewish settler 
stabbed both attacks were blamed on arabs 
sharon told reporters in ariel on monday that prime minister 
yitzhak shamir must instruct the defense minister to impose law 
and order immediately and if the prime minister is not successful 
there are always means to solve it to replace him rabin is a 
possibility 
sharon a member of shamirs rightwing likud bloc also 
criticized the leftleaning labor party whose leaders have said 
only a political settlement can end the uprising during which 211 
palestinians and four israelis have died rabin is a labor member 
the root of evil is that some in the political establishment 
are constantly trying to explain that the solution can only be 
political sharon said this just prevents the forces the 
army from taking all the necessary steps

the house on monday approved legislation to 
grant some school districts a deadline extension for drawing up 
plans to get deadly asbestos out of their school buildings 
the bill was sent by voice vote to the senate where a similar 
proposal is pending 
under a 1986 law school districts have until next oct 12 to 
survey their facilities for the presence of friable or crumbling 
asbestos and to draft plans to get the cancercausing material 
safely removed or stabilized 
the house bill would allow a governor to extend this deadline to 
may 9 1989 the legislation would not change the july 9 1989 
date by which the 1986 law requires school districts to begin 
implementing their plans 
congress is in the process of allowing casebycase deadline 
extensions because school officials around the country have 
complained that a shortage of trained personnel and money are 
hampering the drafting of plans 
the environmental protection agency has estimated that as many 
as 30000 schools may contain dangerous asbestos whose fibers have 
been proven to cause lung cancer and other respiratory ailments

the boat wrecks found on sandbars 
exposed by the droughtshrunken mississippi river are probably just 
the first of many that will appear an archaeolgist says 
archaeologists will be deciding in the coming weeks which of the 
steamboats should be reclaimed 
one thing we have to keep in mind in evaluating these wrecks 
and how much we should spend on them is that i expect others to 
appear all up and down the mississippi said skip 
stewartabernathy of the arkansas archaeological survey who is 
investigating the remains of several boats found last week at west 
memphis 
once we have a feel for how much weve got then we can 
decide how to use scarce resources he said sunday 
last week the wreckage of five or six craft were found 
including one that is certainly a steamboat and one that may be a 
steamboat while the rest are probably barges he said 
all of these are wooden vessels dating from about 1880 to 
about 1910 1920 he said the definite steamboat has been 
ripped around it may have come ashore unhappy theres a lot of 
firebricks and reinforcing rod and some odd pieces of engine things 
that confirm that it was a steamboat the sidewheeler kind 
one wreck is in good shape its 140 feet by 30 feet wide and 
it was probably a steamboat and probably a sidewheeler but it has 
been heavily salvaged not long after it was lost 
the wreck that has been positively identified as a steamboat 
probably dates from before 1900 stewartabernathy said because 
there is no sign that round wire nails which came into use about 
the turn of the century were used in its manufacture the other 
wreck identified as a probable steamboat he said has both round 
nails and square nails indicating that some work was done on it 
after 1900 
that boat had an interesting history he said it looks to 
have been badly damaged perhaps in a fire and there was a lot of 
rebuilding done on the deck its that rebuilding that used the 
modern nails 
none of the wrecks has been identified stewartabernathy said 
i took more than 160 pictures and that was just a start we 
want to come away with enough information to put together 
blueprints he said 
that involves money he said and we need to explore avenues 
for that within a couple of weeks we should have an idea of how 
these wrecks relate to other wrecks in the mississippi valley and 
decide what else ought to be done

the massive fuel spill in the ohio river last 
january demonstrated the need for stiffer regulations to guard 
against such accidents a congressional report said monday 
the congressional research service said in a 21page analysis 
that ashland oil inc complied with federal standards in assuming 
responsibility for the difficult cleanup of more than 700000 
gallons of diesel fuel from a terminal near pittsburgh on jan 2 
the problem crs said appears to lie in looselywritten 
regulations that make it difficult for the environmental protection 
agency to detect problems before they occur the research agency 
noted that it was only after the collapse of an ashland tank that 
epa found faults with the companys spill prevention plan 
the fueltank collapse at ashlands floreffe terminal caused the 
contamination of drinking water in pennsylvania west virginia and 
ohio the rupture stemmed from a dimesized flaw in the tanks 
nearly 50yearold steel wall 
ashland and other owners of aboveground oil tanks holding more 
than 660 gallons are required to file oil spill prevention plans 
which must be reviewed every three years ashlands plan was on 
file near pittsburgh as required 
but the government did not learn about alleged flaws in the plan 
until after the accident epa said in a memorandum on jan 15 that 
ashlands spill prevention control and countermeasures plan does 
not adequately address spill prevention and control specific to the 
facility 
instead the epa said it merely paraphrases the spcc 
regulations 
but mondays report said the epa never saw the plan before the 
accident because regulations only require that the document be 
prepared not that it be inspected by epa 
under the regulations epa only gets involved after spills have 
occurred unless it has reason to suspect problems 
minor spills should not be the only reason for an spcc plan to 
come before federal and state officials crs said in the report 
more automatic review by epa and state officials might be 
desired and perhaps the regulations should state this 
crs also said congress should consider harsher penalties for 
companies that fail to comply with spill prevention regulations 
the regulations now call for penalties of 5000 for each day 
the violation continues this could be construed as to have very 
limited application perhaps technical violations of only one or 
two days duration crs said 
the epa has been reviewing whether problems with ashlands spill 
prevention plan merit penalties 
ashland spokesman roger schrum said monday that company believes 
the plan met epa regulations 
we have not been fined and its been our contention that we 
had an adequate plan he said 
the crs report was requested by sen jay rockefeller dwva 
the senator said he was committed to pursuing legislation drawing 
from crs recommendations to prevent future spills

chinas grain production may increase by as 
much as 25 percent to around 500 million metric tons by the year 
2000 from an average of 394 million tons in the 1980s an 
agriculture department report said monday 
area sown to grain probably will decrease over the next 12 
years but improved yields could boost total output the report 
said however per capita consumption probably will rise slowly 
as gains in output may be offset by increases in population and 
livestock feed use 
although small amounts of corn and other socalled coarse grains 
are likely to be exported by efficient producers in the northeast 
and rice producers in the south china is expected to remain a net 
grain importer 
costal urban areas will import sizable quantities of wheat for 
human consumption and limited quantities of feed grains the 
departments economic research service said 
us agricultural exports to china in the fiscal year that began 
last oct 1 could exceed 400 million in value about double the 
211 million of 198687 the report said a number of subsized 
sales of us wheat have helped account for the increase

the supreme court on monday agreed to decide 
whether states may tax federal pensions while exempting the 
pensions of retired state workers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by a michigan man seeking 
a 4299 refund from the state 
paul s davis of east lansing is seeking the refund for state 
taxes he paid from 1979 through 1984 davis a lawyer worked for 
the federal government at various times in his career retiring in 
1980 
michigan law allows federal retirees living in the state to 
deduct up to 7500 in their annual government pensions when 
computing what they owe in state taxes 
the law permits retired state workers to deduct all of their 
state pensions from their state taxes 
the michigan court of appeals in 1987 upheld the statute it 
said the state law does not violate a federal law in which congress 
allowed states to tax federal pay or compensation if the 
taxation does not discriminate against federal workers 
the state court also said the different treatment in pensions is 
justified by michigans legitimate policy of recruiting and keeping 
state employees 
the reagan administration supported davis appeal to the supreme 
court 
the justice department said the fact that the discrimination 
at issue here gives the state a competitive edge does not 
distinguish it from any other special tax benefit given to those 
who deal with the state rather than the federal government and does 
not justify the discrimination 
the case is davis vs michigan department of treasury 871020

a major magnetic storm that would have 
disrupted radio communications did not occur monday fulfilling a 
revised forecast that scientists issued in the wake of the largest 
solar flare in four years 
it has not caused any problems that we are aware of said 
michael abbott a forecaster at the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administrations space environmental laboratory in 
boulder 
on friday after a nearly twohour flare forecasters predicted 
a storm that would cause major disruptions to shortwave including 
shoretoshore communications polar communications and contact 
between airliners and ground controllers as well as longdistance 
telephone calls 
but they downgraded that original forecast saturday and amended 
it again sunday 
gary heckman noaas space environment services chief had said 
when the storm warning was issued friday that forecasting such 
disturbances was tricky 
hot gases and electrically charged particles emitted by solar 
flares contain their own magnetic field which must be pointed in 
the right direction to interact with earths magnetic field to 
cause a magnetic storm heckman said 
abbott said the region on the sun that caused the large flares 
has begun rotating away from the earth we dont expect any more 
significant activity from this region he said 
but he said another region that will be pointed toward the earth 
for the next 14 days could produce some activity 
noaa officials in boulder predicted the serious storm friday 
after the largest solar flare in four years exploded on the sun 
fridays solar flare an explosive release of hot gas 
electrically charged particles and xrays began at 1044 am mdt 
and lasted for nearly two hours scientists said 
dale gary a solar astronomer at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena said it was the biggest flare since april 
1984 with its visible portion extending perhaps 200000 miles 
above the suns surface

misdemeanor penalties of up to 90 days in jail and a 10000 fine 
blanchard said he was signing the bill with reservations but 
added it is a significant improvement over the uncertainty and 
confusion of existing state law by taking the profit out of 
childbirth it stands firm against the buying and selling of human 
life 
taking no action to regulate surrogacy contracts would be more 
harmful than taking incomplete or imperfect action 
state sen connie binsfeld a former michigan mother of the 
year pushed the bill through the legislature she has said her 
goal was to drive out of michigan one of the nations most prolific 
surrogate matchmakers dearborn attorney noel keane keane takes 
credit for arranging 228 surrogate births including new jerseys 
baby m 
under the new law women who want to bear a child then give up 
the baby to another couple still could do so and brokers could 
still arrange surrogate births but they all would have to do it 
for free 
typically infertile couples pay a broker 10000 to match them 
with a wouldbe mother they pay another 10000 to the woman who 
agrees to be artifically inseminated carry the child then give up 
custody they also pay for the inseminations medical procedures 
prenatal care hospital bills and other pregnancyrelated expenses 
the new michigan law declares those contracts unenforceable if 
people still wish to enter such a pact the mother can be 
reimbursed for her medical expenses and other pregnancyrelated 
expenses but nothing else 
despite the new law some people question whether it might be 
legal for a michigan couple to sign a contract in another state and 
carry out everything else in michigan 
michigan is the first state to attach criminal penalties to 
surrogateparent contracts but not the first to tackle the issue 
kentucky and louisiana have enacted laws declaring such 
contracts illegal but dont impose criminal penalties nebraska 
doesnt recognize the legal validity of surrogateparenting 
contracts indiana has put enforcement of such arrangements on hold 
while the issue is researched and proposed regulations were vetoed 
in arkansas in the landmark baby m case the new jersey 
supreme court outlawed surrogateparenting contracts in that state

the soviet union has continued to ship arms to 
nicaragua despite a ceasefire and peace talks between the 
sandinista government and the usbacked contra rebels but the 
amount of war materiel being delivered appears to be dropping 
rapidly pentagon figures show 
during the first five months of the year russia and its warsaw 
pact allies shipped 5500 metric tons or about 6050 regular tons 
of military equipment to the sandinistas according to defense 
department estimates released monday 
by comparison shipments of soviet equipment during calendar 
1987 arrived at an average rate of 1808 metric tons per month or 
9040 metric tons for the first five months of 1987 that 
translates to 9944 regular tons 
the drop in shipments is equally pronounced when expressed in 
terms of estimated dollar value the pentagon estimated the 
materiel delivered during the first five months of this year was 
worth 160 million shipments in 1987 were worth about 42 million 
a month or about 210 million for five months 
during all of 1987 the nicaraguans received 21700 metric tons 
of arms valued at 505 million the defense department estimates 
the new figures are contained in a pentagon briefing paper that 
is updated on a monthly basis for top administration officials the 
latest update provides estimates through the end of may 
defense officials who spoke only on condition they not be named 
said monday it was too early to predict soviet intentions for 
arming nicaragua for the year the military deliveries normally 
fluctuate from month to month and there always could be a spurt 
later in the year one source noted 
on the other hand there is a feeling that perhaps the 
russians are less enthusiastic right now under soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev about handing out their resources around the 
world 
the slowdown in deliveries to nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government comes at a time when us aid to the contra guerrillas 
has been cut completely the reagan administration under 
congressional pressure ended its military assistance to the 
contras at the end of february three weeks before a truce and 
ceasefire took effect 
soviet arms shipments to the sandinistas have climbed steadily 
over the past eight years rising from only about 16 metric tons 
in 1980 to peak at 22000 metric tons in 1986

witnesses of the protest in catak 575 miles southeast of ankara 
said two civil defense workers were injured by stones but no one 
was arrested 
one body was found the day of the landslide but none has been 
discovered since the crew of about 170 rescue workers has combed 
about five acres of the mud and rock that crashed down on the 
village and officials have halted work frequently for fear of 
causing more slides 
a stream diverted by landslides also flooded part of catak 
huseyin gul whose uncle ran the coffeehouse shouted at the 
rescue workers monday five days have passed and my uncle is 
still buried what are you doing there

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi on monday 
rejected allegations that he is a south african puppet and said he 
has full sympathy for south african blacks fighting for an end 
to apartheid 
but savimbi said his first priority is to bring an end to the 
sovietcuban presence in angola and to promote a peaceful 
settlement to the 13year civil war in his homeland 
savimbi who is on a 10day good will tour of the united states 
spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the newly created congressional 
task force on angola which supports us goals in the african 
nation 
as part of an effort to encourage the withdrawal of cuban forces 
in angola and to achieve a negotiated settlement with angolas 
marxist government the united states has been supplying military 
equipment to savimbis unita forces for the past several years 
the angolan government took out an advertisement in mondays 
editions of the new york times highlighting savimbis ties to south 
africa which has been supporting the unita war effort the 
advertisement called savimbi south africas secret agent 
but savimbi said he has been attempting to encourage south 
african president pw botha to release nelson mandela the 
antiapartheid black leader who has been imprisoned since the 1960s 
we have full sympathy for those fighting for freedom in south 
africa savimbi said 
savimbi said cuba has sent an additional 12000 troops to angola 
recently and has become the masters of angolas fate he said 
the increase has raised the cuban troop commitment to 57000 us 
estimates put the figure at between 43000 and 45000 
savimbi said unita requires additional help from the united 
states because angola received 15 billion worth of weaponry from 
the soviet union last year 
there is no sign they are going to decrease savimbi said 
last week the united states welcomed indications from the 
angolan government that it was not demanding a cessation of us 
support for unita in return for serious negotiations for a peace 
settlement 
officials from the united states angola cuba and south africa 
met last week for a second time to explore the prospects for a 
negotiated peace the us position has been that aid to unita is 
not an appropriate topic for discussion in the talks

norways environmentalist prime minister gro 
harlem brundtland opened a world conference on the changing 
climate monday with a plan of action on ways to preserve the 
earths damaged atmosphere 
she said the greenhouse effect in which manmade pollution 
trapped in the atmosphere is warming up the planets surface 
presents humanity with a crucial question 
will we devote our abilities our energy and our efforts to 
further shortterm material wellbeing or will we commit ourselves 
to enhancing life on planet earth 
addressing more than 300 scientists from 40 countries 
brundtland called for a new holistic ethic in which economic 
growth and environmental protection go handinhand around the 
world 
she is chairwoman of the un world commission on environment 
and development whose report last year our common future was 
hailed as a landmark 
brundtland said rich nations have a special responsibility 
we have been playing lethal games with vital lifesupport 
systems the prime minister told participants in the canadian 
governmentsponsored world conference on the changing atmosphere 
for too long have we used the atmosphere soil and water as 
the ultimate sink of our industrial excesses 
her fivepart plan calls for transfer of modern lowpolluting 
technology to third world countries now so they wont repeat the 
same mistakes made by industrialized nations 
the plan also urges a standstill in energy use by the year 2000 
followed by efforts to reduce production and consumption levels 
and therefore pollution 
other points include more worldwide research on renewable energy 
sources and climatic change and consideration of a global 
convention on atmospheric protection 
the meeting was inspired by the brundtland commissions report 
and was convened amidst the worst drought for 50 years across the 
north american farm belt 
but scientists said they were reluctant to connect the drought 
with the longterm greenhouse effect caused by emissions of carbon 
dioxide nitrous oxide ozone and methane most of the gases are 
byproducts from burning coal gas oil and wood 
the 1970s and 1980s have produced summer warming and 
increasing incidence of severe drought said kenneth hare 
chairman of canadas climate program planning board 
its possibly the greenhouse effect at work but our models 
are not accurate enough to say it is he added however 
summers like this may well become more frequent and more extensive 
in the future 
hare said concentration of the greenhouse gases will double in 
the first half of the 21st century raising average temperatures by 
up to 7 degrees causing sea levels to rise and regional climates 
to alter 
with less moisture available he said winter wheat may well 
be the standard crop of the future in the canadian prairies instead 
of the spring wheat we grow now 
hare said nations should prohibit chemical compounds responsible 
for the toxic gases and negotiate an international energy protocol 
that would encourage hydroelectric power and reexamine the role of 
nuclear energy 
robert t watson chief of the upper atmosphere research program 
at the us national aeronautics and space administration said 
combating the greenhouse effect will be much more complex that 
tackling ozone depletion 
twentyfour nations signed the 1987 montreal protocol on 
protecting the earths ozone layer by restricting 
chlorofluorocarbons the chemicals used in aerosol sprays 
insulation refrigerators and industrial cleaning the ozone layer 
protects the earth from the suns most harmful ultraviolet rays 
but watson said the buildup of methane gas in the atmosphere 
closely entwined with many industrial processes is more mysterious 
in opening the conference canadas prime minister brian 
mulroney offered to act as host for a un world conference on 
sustainable development in 1992 
mulroney also urged participants to start working on an 
international law of the air that would discourage air 
pollution in the way the international law of the sea controls the 
oceans 
but watson said it was premature to start work on such an 
international covenant since researchers have much more to learn 
its quite clear that energy conservation is a good idea the 
less energy we burn the less co2 carbon dioxide will go into the 
atmosphere but how you translate that into international policy is 
another matter watson said

latvian communists have proposed in their program 
for a 5000member conference that the soviet communist party 
leader be elected by direct secret ballot and face a mandatory 
retirement age 
the latvians followed proposals of another baltic state 
estonia in demanding more economic and political autonomy but 
they were the first to call openly for such firm limits on the 
position of general secretary now held by mikhail s gorbachev 
suggestions approved by the policymaking central committee in 
may call for the tenure of party elected officials to be limited to 
two fiveyear terms that could be one of the key items of debate 
at the party conference which begins tuesday 
unlimited terms of office and the absence of any retirement age 
have allowed party leaders to build over the years a system of 
entrenched power and privilege 
the program of the latvian delegation was published in the june 
18 edition of the official newspaper sovietskaya latvia the 
newspaper was received in moscow on monday the eve of the first 
party conference since 1941 
for this in part it is proposed to carry out direct 
elections by secret ballot for the top leaders of party organs 
from the secretary of the party bureau of primary party 
organizations to the central committees general secretary 
establish limited terms of office for all without exception to 
establish a single retirement age for all party leaders the 
platform said 
the party leader now is chosen by the ruling politburo and 
confirmed by the central committee it was not clear from the text 
of the latvian proposal who would be allowed to vote for the 
general secretary 
gorbachev has said he supports limits on the terms of party 
officials 
the latvian group also proposed that a national monument to the 
victims of stalins purges be built in moscow 
earlier this month the official soviet media said such a 
monument had been approved in latvia to commemmorate those deported 
by stalin after the soviet union annexed latvia estonia and the 
third baltic republic lithuania in 1940 
the baltic republics are the soviet unions most 
westwardlooking and technologically advanced latvia followed the 
lead of estonia in demanding greater economic freedom from moscow 
and the power to exercise it 
latvians must have the power to determine the basic questions 
connected with the determination of structure and activity of the 
republic and local organs of government power and administration 
it said 
they also demanded control over key functions of running the 
economy of the republic decision of questions of establishing 
prices tariffs pay for labor financial and credit policies 
the program called for legal guarantees against interference in 
local affairs by officials in moscow

syrianallied palestinian dissidents 
overran beiruts chatilla refugee camp in a 13hour battle monday 
and plo chairman yasser arafats fighters surrendered or laid down 
their weapons police said 
the fall of the camp dealt a serious setback for arafats 
mainstream fatah which has been fighting col saeed mousas 
radical fatahuprising faction since may 1 for control of the 
chatilla and nearby bourj elbarajneh camps 
the palestine liberation organization openly blamed syria for 
the fighting 
the plo executive committee the guerrilla movements 
policymaking body said the government of syrian president hafez 
assad is implementing a black political scheme aimed at 
undermining the palestinian presence in lebanon 
about 140 of arafats men in chatilla surrendered to syrian and 
libyan officers police said 
sixty other arafat loyalists including 45 believed to be 
wounded told libyan mediators they had put down their weapons and 
asked to be taken to arafats bases in south lebanon police said 
police said arrangements were being made to take the 60 
fighters holed up in the camps only bomb shelter in a bus convoy 
with syrian and libyan escorts to the southern port city of sidon 
on tuesday 
were not going to hurt them after theyve surrendered said 
one mousa fighter who declined to give his name 
in sidon police said a car bomb exploded near a fatah office in 
the mieh mieh refugee camp killing three palestinian guerrillas 
and wounding six 
there was no claim of responsibility but radio stations said 
the bombing was an attempt to assassinate guerrilla leader munir 
madbah who commands fatahs force 17 security unit in sidon force 
17 has claimed responsibility for several terrorist attacks in 
israel over the last three years 
heavy fighting also broke out for a halfhour monday night 
between the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and syrian 
troops in the bekaa valley in east lebanon the christianrun voice 
of lebanon radio reported 
there was no independent verification of the clashes reported in 
baalbeck 42 miles east of beirut and the radio said nothing of 
casualities 
syria irans main arab ally in irans war against iraq has 
been alarmed by the tehran governments attempt through hezbollah 
to dominate lebanons 12 million shiite moslems the nations 
largest sect 
virtually every building in the chatilla camp was wrecked or 
heavily damaged in the fighting 
no earthquake could have wreaked such devastation said a 
syrian officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in all 127 people have been killed and 527 wounded since may 1 
when the rival factions began fighting for control of the two camps 
on beiruts southern outskirts 
mousas guerrillas stormed into chatilla during the night and 
trapped arafats men police said 
you have a last chance to surrender and turn yourselves in to 
the syrian army or face a final onslaught the dissident command 
said in a statement communicated to the encircled loyalists 
many of arafats men stumbled out of the cement block shanties 
with their hands clasped on their heads 
police said syrian army officers and libyan observers took 
charge of the men who surrendered while negotiations continued for 
the surrender of the other 60 
four libyan mediators headed by maj salim farjani shuttled 
between the bomb shelter and mousas headquarters 
were here to stop the bloodletting farjani told reporters 
any new attack from either side is going to be considered an 
aggression against libya he did not elaborate 
the syrians whose troops ring the camps insisted on arresting 
fatahs commander in chatilla youssef sharkawi his 
secondincommand who also is known as nader and his assistant 
amneh jibril the official said 
sharkawi and nader were among the wounded he said 
the official predicted that mousas guerrillas would soon start 
bombarding the sprawling bourj elbarajneh camp within a few 
days possibly hours 
radio stations reported that arafat appealed to soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev to pressure syria to stop the bombardment of 
the beirut camps he reportedly made similar pleas to libya 
algeria and tunisia 
plo officials earlier appealed to assad to intervene to rein in 
the dissidents or at least stop them using syriancontrolled 
territory to shell the camps 
syria has thousands of troops enforcing security in west and 
south beirut but they made no move to stop the fighting which 
flared despite a reconciliation between arafat and assad in april 
to end a 5yearold feud over who would control the palestinian 
movement 
mondays plo statement attacking syria issued in nicosia 
cyprus and tunis tunisia where the plo has its political 
headquarters did not say what effect the latest events would have 
on the assadarafat reconciliation

defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
monday he will travel to moscow in early august for his third 
meeting with soviet defense minister dmitri yazov on reducing 
military tension between the superpowers 
in the first business session between the soviet and us 
defense secretaries carlucci and yazov met in bern switzerland 
last march and for a second time during the moscow summit may 
31june 2 
the dialogue is not valuable for its own sake but only as a 
means to enhance our security carlucci said in a speech at the 
national press club our discussions in bern and last month in 
moscow were candid and i think precisely because of that 
constructive 
we have gained a great deal from having an opportunity to air 
our differences and to explore ways that we might improve our 
relations he said as in our earlier meetings our agenda will 
include exploring ways to avoid dangerous military incidents and 
to expand militarytomilitary contacts 
carlucci said he was skeptical of the reform rhetoric of kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev and of soviet claims that they are 
shifting to a purely defensive military posture 
for my part i have indicated that the united states would 
welcome such a shift but that in spite of soviet claims we see no 
change in the soviet force structure and no reduction in resources 
devoted to the soviet military which continues to absorb between 
15 and 17 percent of the soviet gross national product he said 
now is not the time to let down our guard he said there 
is every reason to believe that the soviets see in our technology a 
way to derive not only economic but military advantage 
if the end result of reform is a soviet union that is less 
expansionist that reduces the resources it now devotes to the 
military that delivers on its promises to respect fundamental 
freedoms and human rights that is more open to dialogue with the 
west then change will have been for the better carlucci said 
on the other hand if the end product of soviet restructuring 
is nothing more than the development perhaps even with western 
assistance of a stronger soviet military machine then we in the 
west will face a far more dangerous threat than we do at present 
he said 
an aide to carlucci said that the exact dates and interinary of 
the trip to moscow would not be announced until next month

fitts said afterward that he expected the decision by the grand 
jury and would ask to have the trial moved out of the county 
the power structure has long roots in williamsburg county 
he said 
but the attorney for the two men who brought the suit said fitts 
is only seeking publicity i think hes got a million dollars 
worth of publicity for a slander sheet wallace connor said 
state rep bj gordon and state sen frank mcgill both 
democrats brought the charges in response to a may 17 column in 
which fitts urged voters to reject the countys legislators in the 
june primary and accused them of stealing 
both mcgill and gordon won renomination in that election 
fitts the 62yearold black editor of the voice a 
blackoriented newspaper with a circulation of 2300 riled gordon 
who is black and mcgill who is white with the column 
it said i will say to you without fear of contradiction if 
every black in williamsburg county would start stealing today and 
steal every day for the rest of their lives they could not steal 
as much as those two have stolen during their time in power 
the column gave no specifics when asked later what he thought 
they had stolen fitts said only that they had taken the pride of 
people of williamsburg county 
sitting in the first row of the 165yearold county courthouse 
fitts showed no emotion as the indictment was read 
im not surprised im not disappointed he said afterward 
and i welcome the opportunity to be heard in court i got what i 
wanted 
the case probably will be tried in late august or early 
september at the earliest solicitor wade kolb has said 
if convicted fitts could face 5000 in fines and a year in 
prison on each of the two counts he is free on personal 
recognizance bond 
though libel lawsuits are not unusual criminal libel cases that 
can send a journalist to jail are 
the williamsburg county case is believed to be only the fourth 
involving journalists in 40 years in south carolina and the first 
such case in the nation since 1984 
the south carolina chapter of the american civil liberties union 
said monday it will ask dismissal of the charges

ann richards fiery populist and texas state 
treasurer was chosen monday to deliver the keynote speech and 
set the tone for the democratic national convention in atlanta 
next month 
party chief paul g kirk said ms richards has the ability to 
tell it like it is as he announced that the 54yearold will be 
the second woman in party history to take the podium to deliver the 
opening address of the meeting she is the first woman to hold 
statewide office in texas in half a century 
kirk said the democratic nomineetobe michael dukakis was 
consulted on the choice and was interested in having a woman to 
step to the podium on july 18 
he was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a 
woman kirk said not only because of the importance of the 
family concerns the issues of stress and struggle that women are 
going through in the daily work lives and family lives but i think 
it is symbolic of the importance of women to the american family 
and the realities of all of that 
and the fact that lets face it that is a strength of the 
democratic party and a weakness of george bush and the 
republicans 
ms richards who held a news conference in austin texas 
shortly after kirks announcement said american families are 
what i know the most about other than my professional job 
known for her sparkling rhetoric ms richards said she honed 
her speaking ability on the soap boxes of smalltown texas 
for about the past 10 years ive been making speeches at the 
madisonville cattlemans association and the mcallen 
mexicanamerican democrats convention and the nacogdoches chamber 
of commerce and in any number of places that you think of ms 
richards said its sort of like how do you get to carnegie 
hall you just practice 
ms richards who plans to seek the texas governorship in 1990 
emerged over the weekend as the likely choice for the keynote job 
which offers a national audience to impress or disappoint the only 
other woman ever to have the role was former rep barbara jordan 
also of texas who shared the job with sen john glenn of ohio 
kirk said he was happy to announce that ms richards would set 
the tone for democrats in atlanta and to draw the distinctions 
between the party of the working american people and the party of 
the establishment ann richards is a mainstream democrat and a 
fiery populist from texas one of george bushs adopted states 
she has the ability to tell it like it is and speak in the 
language working americans can understand and relate to he 
added 
kirk was asked if the selection of another texan for a prominent 
role at the atlanta meeting july 1821 was indicative of the 
importance of the state in the fall house speaker jim wright of 
texas is the convention chairman 
in fact when you look at the electoral college map you cant 
do enough for texas kirk said 
kirk defended wrights role as chairman of the convention 
despite the investigations focusing on charges of unethical 
behavior against the house speaker 
there is no hesitancy on my part or on the part of the 
democratic party about speaker wrights role at the convention 
kirk said 
kirk also announced the appointment of four cochairmen for the 
convention vermont gov madeleine kunin rep norman mineta of 
california former new mexico gov toney anaya and little rock 
ark mayor lottie shackelford 
kirk said in answer to a question that he would be glad to serve 
as democratic national committee chairman through the general 
election even though his term expires right after the convention 
but after the election that will be that 
ms richards was born on sept 1 1933 outside of waco texas 
a graduate of baylor university she was first elected to office as 
a member of the travis county commissioners court in 1976 in 
1982 she was elected state treasurer the first woman to hold 
statewide office there in over 50 years 
she is a divorced mother of four grown children

the city council will consider banning 
skateboarding only in the downtown business district after both 
youths and grownups objected monday to the idea of a citywide 
prohibition on the popular sport 
in chambers packed with concerned skateboarders ages 8 to 32 
mayor bill frederick said the council had decided to rewrite a bill 
and scale down the proposed ban 
city officials police and property owners said they were 
concerned with safety property damage and vandalism in initially 
proposing a prohibition on all public streets sidewalks and 
property 
we need to build a place where we can all skate we can 
work together for it said 16yearold rick andrews 
his comments typified the sentiment of the crowd of 50 to 60 
young people appearing at city hall to protest the proposal 
the youngsters many in shorts and tshirts and some carrying 
their skateboards into the council chambers said damage and 
vandalism were restricted to a small percentage of people and 
resulted from not having any place in which they could practice the 
popular sport 
the young people got support from a number of parents and other 
grownups 
only one person spoke up for a limited ban but he too said the 
city should work with skateboarders businessmen and property 
owners toward the construction of skate parks or ramps 
calling the revised plan a major change in direction the 
mayor said the city was concerned about its liability if it built a 
skateboarding area but he urged the youths to form a committee to 
work with city officials on an ordinance and a possible park 
gene groves an active skateboarder told the commission that 
skateboarding is a principal form of transportation for many 
young people particularly those too young to drive 
he and others said other florida cities such as ocala tampa and 
jacksonville had public and private skateboard parks and orlando 
should too 
the council action monday puts the issue back into the 
discussion stage further meetings will be held before it comes up 
for another public hearing 
under the proposal skateboarding also would be outlawed on 
private property such as parking lots without permission from the 
owners violators would face a maximum fine of 500 and 60 days in 
jail

defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
monday he will travel to moscow in early august for his third 
meeting with soviet defense minister dmitri yazov and the 
secondranking soviet defense official will tour the united states 
in july 
the exchange of visits is aimed at reducing military tension 
between the superpowers as part of a general widening and 
improvement in the ussoviet dialogue 
in the first business session between the soviet and us 
defense secretaries carlucci and yazov met in bern switzerland 
last march and for a second time during the moscow summit may 
31june 2 
the dialogue is not valuable for its own sake but only as a 
means to enhance our security carlucci said in a speech at the 
national press club our discussions in bern and last month in 
moscow were candid and i think precisely because of that 
constructive 
we have gained a great deal from having an opportunity to air 
our differences and to explore ways that we might improve our 
relations he said as in our earlier meetings our agenda will 
include exploring ways to avoid dangerous military incidents and 
to expand militarytomilitary contacts 
the soviet first deputy defense minister marshal sergei f 
akhromeyev will make a july 511 visit to the united states at the 
invitation of adm william crowe chairman of the us joint chiefs 
of staffs the pentagon and soviet news agency tass announced 
akhromeyev was in washington last december for the summit but 
the upcoming trip will be his first visit outside the nations 
capital the pentagon announcement said 
akhromeyev the soviet chief of staff will tour military 
units from all four military services and will travel to virginia 
north carolina texas oklahoma south dakota and new york during 
his visit it said 
crowe and akhromeyev will have joint news conferences on july 6 
and july 11 and on july 11 the soviet marshal will address a 
meeting of the council on foreign relations in new york city 
akhromeyev will not be allowed to view any classified training 
or equipment the pentagon said but he will visit camp lejeune 
nc the aircraft carrier uss theodore roosevelt fort hood 
texas and ellsworth air force base sd 
the soviet defense official will be allowed to view a new b1b 
bomber but will not be allowed to fly in one the pentagon added 
in his speech carlucci said he was skeptical of the reform 
rhetoric of kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev and of soviet 
claims that they are shifting to a purely defensive military 
posture 
for my part i have indicated that the united states would 
welcome such a shift but that in spite of soviet claims we see no 
change in the soviet force structure and no reduction in resources 
devoted to the soviet military which continues to absorb between 
15 and 17 percent of the soviet gross national product he said 
now is not the time to let down our guard he said there 
is every reason to believe that the soviets see in our technology a 
way to derive not only economic but military advantage 
if the end result of reform is a soviet union that is less 
expansionist that reduces the resources it now devotes to the 
military that delivers on its promises to respect fundamental 
freedoms and human rights that is more open to dialogue with the 
west then change will have been for the better carlucci said 
on the other hand if the end product of soviet restructuring 
is nothing more than the development perhaps even with western 
assistance of a stronger soviet military machine then we in the 
west will face a far more dangerous threat than we do at present 
he said 
an aide to carlucci said that the exact dates and interinary of 
the trip to moscow would not be announced until next month

diplomatic relations with the holy see dos santos said the 
government has said to us we are ready now it depends on the

a new airbus 320 that crashed at an air show was 
flying too low for the load it carried and the pilot did not have 
time to maneuver it out of danger officials said monday after a 
preliminary investigation 
three passengers were killed and 50 injured as the jetlinger 
crashed into the woods sunday during a demonstration flight near 
mulhouse in eastern france 
daniel tennenbaum chief of the civil aviation authority said 
the air france jet was flying at 30 feet 
in mulhouse prosecutor jean volff said the a320 passed at 30 
feet altitude which is completely outside the technical norms when 
it is carrying passengers 
he said the normal minimum altitude for such conditions was 100 
feet and added without giving details that the pilot had 
disconnected the automatic controls at the moment of the accident 
and was in manual control 
tennenbaum told a news conference in paris the fully 
computerized aircraft needed eight seconds to respond to the 
command of pilot michel hasseline and only five seconds were 
available because of the low altitude 
hasseline was quoted in the french press monday as telling a 
rescuer i wanted to increase the power but the aircraft did not 
respond 
louis mermaz the transport minister said the crash did not 
reflect on the performance of the a320 
he said there was no available element that puts into question 
the good functioning of the aircraft and the security of a320 
flights during normal functioning nothing justifies ending a320 
flights 
mermaz said he called the news conference because news reports 
questioned the new aircrafts reliability and it was important to 
respond quickly to the legitimate public questions 
a spokesman for airbus industrie the manufacturer said earlier 
there were indications human error caused the crash but christian 
roger president of the air france pilots union said the engines 
may have failed to restart at the pilots command the aircraft was 
carrying 133 people 
the union added in a statement if the breakdown was in the 
computer there would be no information on it in the black box 
mermaz also speaking earlier monday said both flight recorders 
or black boxes containing flight data were recovered so 
the inquiry should be rapid 
government officials said privately the pilot hasseline and 
copilot pierre mazieres were not injured and should be able to 
help investigators 
authorities in mulhouse identified the dead late monday as herve 
liermann a 14yearold paraplegic from a village near mulhouse who 
could not escape the fire marianne barry 7 of mulhouse and 
mariefrancoise foresch 42 of tours 
the narrowbodied a320 was developed by a european consortium 
over four years at a cost of 2 billion the 60 million 
twinengine aircraft entered service in april advertised as the 
fastestselling plane in history and airbus says it already has 
orders for about 500 
it can carry 150 to 180 people and consumes 40 percent less fuel 
than similar planes with two or three jet engines france britain 
west germany and spain are partners in the consortium 
in the crash sunday the plane clipped some trees during a low 
pass over the airfield and plunged into a forest in front of 
television cameras and about 1000 people attending the mulhouse 
air show only the red white and blue tail was left unscorched 
an official in the control tower speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the jet appeared to lose power as it passed over 
the field in habsheim a village about 15 miles from the swiss 
border 
air france and british airways have two a320s each and grounded 
them after the accident but later announced they were convinced 
the plane was safe and operations would resume tuesday 
no us airline has a320s yet but northwest has 100 on order 
and pan am has 16 ordered with an option to buy 34 more 
the a320 has a fully computerized flightcontrol system which 
the manufacturer says permits safer electronically controlled 
flight the only commercial airliner with a similar system is the 
supersonic concorde 
five computers modify and relay the pilots directions to wing 
and tail flaps but a mechanical cable link to the tail would allow 
the pilot to fly manually in an emergency 
air france took delivery thursday of the plane that crashed and 
had flown it six times saturday the a320 was certified for flight 
feb 26 
airbus spokesman david velupillai said monday the company very 
encouraged by the transport ministers statements 
we are at the begininning of the commercialization of this 
aircraft and we certainly would have preferred that this not 
happen he said but we are not at all worried

about 30000 hungarians rallied monday 
against a romanian plan to destroy thousands of villages that would 
affect many members of the ethnic hungarian minority the official 
mti news agency said 
the hourlong torchlight gathering at the downtown heroes square 
was the biggest unofficial demonstration in hungary since the 
antisoviet uprising that was crushed in 1956 and the first such 
rally permitted by police in this communist nation 
there had been fear romanian instigators might use the gathering 
to incite illegal actions but no incidents were reported 
in march president nicolae ceausescu announced plans for 
demolishing 7000 romanian villages that would be replaced by big 
agriculturalindustrial centers 
the forced resettlement program would affect hundreds of 
villages romanias 17 million ethnic hungarians who complain of 
official discrimination and say they are denied ethnic and cultural 
rights 
a manifesto read to the crowd said after 50 years there is 
another criminal committing genocide 
hungarian intellectuals have repeatedly denounced as genocide 
both the project for demolishing villages and romanias alleged 
policy of discrimination against ethnic hungarians 
the manifesto also referred to the mass murder of jews and other 
civilians committed by the nazis before and during world war ii 
it was composed by istvan csurka a prominent hungarian 
nonconformist writer and read by actor istvan bubik it combined 
appeals for restraint and for solidarity with ethnic hungarians in 
romania 
thousands were allowed to assemble in historic heroes square 
without police interference the manifesto said and declared it 
is a victory that we are here but it is also a tragedy 
relations between the neighboring warsaw pact nations have 
deteriorated rapidly over the issue of ethnic hungarians romania 
accuses hungary of interfering in its internal affairs 
observers as a possible sign the new hungarian leadership will 
take a tough stand regarding romania 
csurka appealed to hungarians to show solidarity and 
determination in trying to prevent what the magyar nemzet newspaper 
earlier monday called romanias bulldozer revolution 
numerous banners at the rally denounced the resettlement plan 
scores of demonstrators held up signs of place names in 
hungarian german and romanian that they fear will vanish from the 
map 
after the rally most of those assembled marched to the romanian 
embassy with a memorandum for the romanians protesting the 
demolition project 
the romanian staterun media have said the program aims at 
gaining more farmland for use by the countrys collectivized 
agriculture plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and 
livestock fodder shortages

democratic officials tapped texas state treasurer ann richards 
on monday to draw the distinctions between democrats and 
republicans in the keynote address at their national convention 
next month while michael dukakis intensified his search for a vice 
presidential running mate 
the preconvention democratic flurry came as vice president 
george bush alternating campaign activities with his official 
duties met with israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin in 
washington 
democrat jesse jackson was in atlantic city nj to watch two 
other heavyweights in action boxers mike tyson and michael spinks 
and a fresh poll indicated that dukakis owns a doubledigit lead 
over bush but may be vulnerable to attack since he is not well 
known among the voters despite months of campaigning through the 
primaries 
democratic party chairman paul kirk held a news conference in 
washington to announce that ms richards 54 would deliver the 
keynote address in prime time on the july 18 opening night of the 
convention in atlanta he said the decision was cleared in advance 
with dukakis 
the choice seemed to signal a desire to court not only female 
voters who favor dukakis in the polls but also southerners who 
do not 
kirk said she was picked to set the tone for democrats in 
atlanta and to draw the distinctions between the party of the 
working american people and the party of of the establishment ann 
richards is a mainstream democrat and a fiery populist from texas 
one of george bushs adopted states 
in texas ms richards the divorced mother of four grown 
children said i probably will be talking very much about 
american families i think thats what i know the most about other 
than my professional job 
she said the speaking ability praised by kirk and others was 
sharpened on the soap boxes of smalltown texas 
for about the past 10 years ive been making speeches at the 
madisonville cattlemens association and the mcallen 
mexicanamerican democrats convention and the nacogdoches chamber 
of commerce and in any number of places that you think of she 
said 
dukakis was wrapping up a fourday vacation at the massachusetts 
island resort of nantucket aides said he would travel to 
washington on wednesday to meet with several dozen senators 
including some who have been mentioned as possible running mates 
no names were disclosed but sources said the campaign has asked 
for background information from several possible vice presidential 
contenders including jesse jackson sens john glenn of ohio bob 
graham of florida llyod bentsen of texas and sam nunn of georgia 
and reps thomas foley of washington and lee hamilton of indiana 
nunn however said monday in a telephone interview that he does 
not have plans to provide any such information to the dukakis 
campaign and he said he has told dukakis he is not interested in 
being on the ticket though he expressed willingness to confer with 
him on the selection of a running mate and other issues 
sen dale bumpers of arkansas and rep richard gephardt of 
missouri have surfaced as additional contenders in recent days 
even though gephardt and dukakis targeted one another with 
hardhitting television commercials last winter during the primary 
campaign 
dukakis aides cast doubt on published reports that the governor 
might announce his selection as early as this weekend but dukakis 
himself has said he hopes to make his choice in advance of the 
convention and aides expect him and his running mate to make a 
quick campaign trip immediately after the convention in atlanta 
ms richards the first woman to hold statewide office in texas 
in 50 years is known for her fiery speaking style and her populist 
views 
he was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a 
woman kirk said of dukakis not only because of the importance 
of the family concerns the issues of stress and struggle that 
women are going through in the daily work lives and family lives 
but i think it is symbolic of the importance of women to the 
american family and the realities of all of that 
and the fact that lets face it that is a strength of the 
democratic party and a weakness of george bush and the 
republicans 
kirk defended house speaker jim wrights role as chairman of the 
convention despite the investigations focusing on charges of 
unethical behavior he also announced the appointment of four 
cochairmen for the convention vermont gov madeleine kunin rep 
norman mineta of california former new mexico gov toney anaya and 
little rock ark mayor lottie shackelford 
bush has been buffeted with bad news in the polls in recent 
weeks and a large new survey conducted for the times mirror corp 
was no exception bush trails dukakis by 53 percent to 40 percent 
the survey found and analyst norman ornstein said voters 
satisfaction with the current state of the economy is overwhelmed 
by their fears about the longterm fate of the nation 
still ornstein said bush should be able to exploit dukakis 
relatively fuzzy image among the voters 
this poll doesnt tell who will win the election ornstein 
told reporters for most americans michael dukakis is a blank 
slate in the next couple of months there will be a lot written on 
the slate and not just by dukakis but also by the media and by 
george bush and the republicans

transportation secretary jim burnley told the 
senate commerce committee monday that congress should expect a veto 
if it passes legislation rewriting the 8yearold law deregulating 
the railroad industry 
burnleys message came in the form of a letter to key members of 
the senate panel on the day before it was to consider a bill 
sponsored by sen jay rockefeller dwva 
the legislation would amend the staggers rail act of 1980 to aid 
shippers of coal grain and other commodities who contend they are 
being harmed by railroad monopolies 
but burnley said in his letter that rockefellers measure 
would erode the substantial gains achieved under the staggers 
act the presidents senior advisers would recommend a veto of the 
legislation or a bill resembling this bill if it were presented to 
the president for his signature 
many railroads have opposed altering the staggers act which 
they say gave them needed pricing and service flexibility and 
enabled them to better compete with trucks congress enacted the 
1980 law to give conrail and other railroads incentives to rebuild 
failing and antiquated systems 
but a coalition of shippers has said the interstate commerce 
commission in its interpretation of staggers has failed to 
protect shippers especially those dependent on a single railroad 
to transport their wares 
a key provision of the bill would force the icc to periodically 
adjust its cost index to reflect productivity gains by railroads 
the icc uses the index to determine how much freight railroads can 
increase their rates each quarter to keep up with inflation 
shippers contend the formula does not account for gains railroads 
have made to make them more efficient 
congressional and administration aides said that rockefeller was 
negotiating with several railroads monday to try to win support for 
the bill 
burnley sent his letter to committee chairman sen ernest 
hollings dsc and to sen john danforth rmo the panels

acknowledging problems with a 
controversial paper on aids a national conference of roman 
catholic bishops decided unanimously monday to write a new 
statement in consultation with the vatican 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago who made the motion for a 
new paper on aids teachings said the paper the many faces of 
aids a gospel response could still be used however bishops wish 
the last of the major items on the agenda at the national 
conference of catholic bishops at st johns university the aids 
paper proposed to have the church teach about condoms as a way to 
stem transmission of aids 
the paper written by the bishops conferences administrative 
board had been criticized by some church officials as an apparent 
endorsement of condoms the church opposes all forms of artificial 
birth control 
were not replacing it the first document stands 
archbishop john may of st louis told a news conference following 
mondays closed session 
this new document will be a document of the whole conference 
all the bishops together may said it will carry the 
discussion further 
the church leaders said the existing paper on aids should have 
been clearer on the church teachings about condoms and should have 
been drafted in closer consultation with the vatican 
may said he would appoint a panel of bishops to draft a new aids 
statement in time for consideration by the next conference to be 
held in november in washington dc 
in retrospect may said it was a mistake for the administrative 
board to release the aids document before review by the vatican and 
the full conference of roughly 300 bishops 
on the other hand he said many bishops were clamoring for 
something to use in their general communities it was a judgment 
call that it was more important to get it done and get it out 
the paper framed sharp differences between conservative and 
liberal factions and questions over the role of the bishops 
conference in teaching parishioners 
it had stressed abstinence from sex outside marriage and 
fidelity within marriage but noting that many in society reject 
church teachings on sexuality it says education programs could 
include accurate information about prophylactic devices as a 
means of preventing transmission of aids 
the incurable fatal disease is spread mainly by the exchange of 
blood or semen during sexual contact or by intravenous drug use 
bernardin said the new paper would try to clarify the churchs 
position on the acceptability of condoms as an aidsprevention 
measure but it was grossly premature to speculate on what 
position the new paper would take he said 
the new document he said can make any clarifications which 
are needed to put to rest any doubts which might exist regarding 
the churchs teaching on sexuality and how that teaching applies to 
the current aids crisis 
bernardin said the stilltobeappointed authors would consult 
with the vatican while writing the new statement 
in a statement bernardin noted that some critics had called for 
the original document to be scrapped outright but said that in his 
opinion that would be disastrous 
withdrawal could give the impression that the entire document 
is flawed and that the entire administrative board was in serious 
error he said such action could reopen the debate with 
greater intensity 
the bishops he said cannot allow criticism of the document 
to continue festering our unity must be restored so that we can 
get on with our business 
a vatican official in a private letter to the bishops 
criticized the aids paper and faulted them for sowing confusion 
among catholics by considering it a newspaper reported 
the milwaukee sentinel said it obtained a copy of the letter by 
cardinal joseph ratzinger who says bishops should approve use of 
condoms under no circumstances and should have consulted the 
vatican ratzinger chief of the vaticans congregation for the 
doctrine of faith had the comments included in a confidential 
booklet prepared for the bishops study before mondays session 
in conclusion ratzinger expressed confidence the bishops would 
follow these considerations which are known to his holiness and 
have his fullest support 
milwaukee archbishop rembert g weakland said he was surprised 
because the letter marked the first time the conference had 
received a private communication from rome before discussing an 
issue 
in previous business at the fourday conference the roughly 280 
bishops approved a report condemning the morality of deploying a 
socalled star wars defense initiative but recommending continued 
research in the context of disarmament negotiations 
the bishops also approved a campaign to raise 20 million to 
help orders support their retired members 
underlying the conference was a larger debate over the role and 
authority of the meetings a recent vatican working paper said the 
us conference and 99 similar conventions around the world have no 
authority as a teacher of catholic doctrine

a pediatricians group said monday it will fight 
any attempt by carnation to advertise a new infant formula to the 
public 
richard narkewicz president of the 34000member american 
academy of pediatrics said he has written a letter to carnation 
president timm f crull saying any attempt to dissuade mothers 
from breastfeeding by advertising infant formula directly to the 
public would be strongly condemned by the academy 
infantformula makers have traditionally refrained from 
advertising directly to the public and the academys longstanding 
policy has been to oppose such advertising narkewicz said 
the academys opposition stems from its concern that such 
product promotion may encourage women to use formula rather than to 
breastfeed their infants narkewicz said 
quite frankly narkewicz said if breastfeeding is the 
best and youve got a multimilliondollar promotion for formula 
whos going to put up the dough to advertise that breastfeeding is 
best nobody 
at a press conference in new york monday carnation announced 
the introduction of an infant formula that the company says will 
help some infants who are allergic to existing formulas 
carnation spokesman richard curd said the company plans an 
information campaign to alert the public to the problem of 
infantformula allergies he said the ads will mention carnation 
not the new product 
the formula called good start ha is a wheybased 
predigested product that carnation says will not cause allergies in 
some children who are allergic to conventional cows milk formulas 
or formulas made from soybean proteins 
dr richard hamburger a professor of pediatrics at the 
university of california san diego who spoke at the press 
conference on the companys behalf said perhaps 8 percent of us 
children are allergic to both milkbased and soybased infant 
formulas the two most commonly used in the united states 
some children who are allergic to both kinds of formula which 
contain whole proteins may not be allergic to good start ha 
which contains proteins that are broken down said hamburger 
hamburger and narkewicz both emphasized that breastfeeding is 
preferred over the use of infant formula 
dr william weil a professor of pediatrics at michigan state 
university and former member of the american academy of pediatrics 
nutrition committee said that as many as 90 percent of children 
may have some food disorder at some time but that formula allergy 
is not usually the cause 
of the carnation product he said it does not sound to me 
like theyve come up with anything in the way of a breakthrough for 
feeding problems in infancy 
adele haley a pharmaceutical business securities analyst for 
smith barney harris upham amp co said carnation made a less than 
convincing argument that it has a significantly different product 
ernie strapazon assistant general manager of carnations 
nutritional products division said the company has developed an 
information campaign for good start ha targeted at consumers and 
focusing on formula intolerance symptoms the message will direct 
consumers to their pediatrician for the solution to problems of 
infant formula intolerance caused by cows milkbased or soybased 
formulas 
narkewicz a south burlington vt pediatrician expressed 
concern that the academys nutrition committee had no opportunity 
to examine the product 
when we learn what this formula is we will have our committee 
look at it and see does it satisfy the standards narkewicz 
said from chicago where he was attending a meeting of the american 
medical association 
but ill tell you one thing we are going to strongly fight 
them if they are advertising infant formula directly to the 
public 
several carnation officials including crull and strapazon were 
aboard a plane from new york to los angeles and could not be 
reached for a response to narkewicz said paulette barrett of 
edelman public relations in new york the agency that organized the 
press conference

jesse jackson said monday he is pleased 
with many of the domestic provisions in the democratic party 
platform but hinted that some foreign policy issues the 
palestinian question in particular may be contested 
he said he is weighing a dozen possible issues that were left 
out of the platform to bring up at the democratic national 
convention in atlanta next month 
by and large we got many of our campaign priorities in the 
platform jackson said at a news conference at the annual 
convention of operation push the civil rights group he founded 
and we protected our right to protest or raise other issues 
in atlanta 
his comments came after democrats meeting in denver and 
washington over the weekend agreed to a platform draft and an 
overhaul of party rules in a rare atmosphere of unity 
jackson indicated that a call for the creation of a palestinian 
homeland rejected by the dukakis forces for inclusion in the 
platform might well be an issue at the convention 
reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienate 
anyone he said when asked whether such a plank might anger jews 
we must put forth a formula that represents security for israel 
and justice for palestine and peace for both 
he declined to name the other issues his camp might bring to the 
floor 
jackson also continued to put himself forth as the one who most 
deserves to be offered the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket with 
michael dukakis 
jackson said no senator or governor has achieved his broad base 
of support and no democrat alive has registered as many voters 
as i have 
on the platform jackson took credit for getting a number of 
issues into the document including a call for a comprehensive 
antidrug effort a plank calling for designation of south africa 
as a terrorist state and a program of third world development

worries about whether israel and south 
africa have nuclear weapons contributed to the lack of agreement on 
disarmament policy at a monthlong special general assembly session 
a un official said monday 
yasushi akashi un undersecretarygeneral for disarmament 
affairs told reporters the united nations did not fail the 
membership failed the united nations 
i think it is a temporary setback but it should be looked 
at in the overall context of the continuous process of the united 
nations to identify and broaden the areas of common interest in 
multilateral disarmament akashi said 
delegates to the special session debated throughout last week 
and into sunday morning on disarmament issues 
the main difference at the session which ended sunday was 
between sweeping disarmament proposals advanced by the soviet union 
and developing nations and more cautious suggestions of the united 
states and some of its western allies 
by sunday morning delegates had given up trying to write a 
mutually acceptable document and the session adjourned 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said monday member 
states came close to a final agreement on most of the provisions 
in the end however basic national positions were not amenable 
to a compromise text 
the 159member general assembly has no power to enforce its 
decisions but delegates said they believed a final resolution 
adopted by consensus would have carried moral authority 
akashi said fears among african nations that south africa was 
developing nuclear weapons were partly responsible for the lack of 
consensus as were similar concerns of arab nations about israel 
nonaligned nations were said to have favored identifying israel 
and south africa as regionl offenders in a final document 
the iraniraq war allegations that iraq has been using chemical 
weapons and the scope of the secretarygenerals role in the 
investigation of the alleged use of chemical weapons created 
another obstacle he said iran and iraq have been at war since 
september 1980 
another of the thorny areas involved india and pakistan 
which regularly accuse each other of developing nuclear weapons he 
said neither has signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
one question about the treaty is whether developing nations have 
a duty to sign it before the united states and soviet union reduce 
their huge nuclear arsenals he said 
as another sticking point akashi mentioned concerns of the 
major powers for their military and strategic positions 
reports at the conference indicated us delegates argued in 
committee against naval disarmament a nuclear test ban and 
proposals that would affect the us spacebased defense system 
commonly called star wars 
other issues dividing delegates were nuclearfree zones and 
militarization of outer space akashi said 
he declared the session successful despite the lack of 
consensus on grounds that prepared the way for progress on arms 
control at the regular general assembly session this fall

a diplomatic row which began with canadas 
expulsion of purported soviet spies cooled down monday when foreign 
minister joe clark called soviet ambassador alexei rodionov into 
his office for a 25minute chat 
rodionov emerged from the meeting and told reporters he was 
satisfied the misunderstanding was over 
but clark who postponed an asian trip monday to meet with 
rodionov said when asked if there was a truce i wouldnt apply 
that term at this stage 
and after 32 soviet and canadian diplomats and officials were 
either expelled or prohibited from reentry clark announced one 
final sanction 
he said soviet workers coming to montreal to rebuild the 
firedamaged soviet consulate may not get visas unless the kremlin 
rescinds its decision to withdraw 25 soviet citizens from their 
jobs at the canadian embassy in moscow 
visas will be reviewed on a casebycase basis as long as moscow 
insists on limiting soviet staff at the embassy the foreign 
minister said 
the mild threat appeared a facesaving gesture however as the 
soviets had pledged to retaliate again and again until canada 
backed off 
since tuesday canada has expelled or barred 19 soviet diplomats 
and officials for purported military and commercial espionage the 
kremlin retaliated with action against 13 canadian diplomats three 
of whom are accused of military espionage 
the soviets shot their last volley on saturday damaging 
canadian diplomatic operations in moscow even further by 
withdrawing 25 of the 39 soviet citizens who cook clean and do 
clerical tasks at the canadian embassy 
the government has given no details of the alleged soviet 
espionage except to say moscow tried to infiltrate canadian 
security agencies 
intelligence sources told the associated press the soviets were 
after highly classified us naval secrets and technology from a 
montreal electronics plant making communications and guidance 
systems for a new generation of canadian frigates and from the us 
submarinemonitoring base at argentia newfoundland 
clark said he remained confident canadian security was not 
breached by the soviet activities 
he had been due to leave monday for bilateral talks in tokyo 
followed by a meeting of the association of southeast asian nations 
in thailand he is now likely to leave wednesday officials said

sen lloyd bentsen of texas who moved into 
the congressional forefront over the past three years in the 
democratic drive to sharpen the nations edge in global trade is 
once again in the spotlight as michael dukakis mulls over his vice 
presidential options 
a southwestern conservative a protestant a washington insider 
bentsen chairs the powerful senate finance committee a record on 
defense that is hawkish but not stridently so what more could 
likely democratic nominee dukakis ask if a balanced ticket is his 
goal for the fall campaign 
no democrat has been elected president in this century without 
carrying texas and bentsen would be a formidable opponent in one 
of the states allbutcertain republican nominee george bush calls 
home 
in fact the texas senator knows all about defeating bush he 
did it in the 1970 senate race 
bentsen an elegantly tailored silverhaired patrician is the 
scion of a wealthy landed family from the rio grande valley he 
used to tool around capitol hill in a creamcolored mercedesbenz 
convertible which he has since sold 
friends describe bentsens way with a speech as not 
incendiary actually his carefully qualified never overstated 
commentaries on the nations foreign trade outlook have been known 
to draw yawns and glazed eyes 
bentsen mounted a 1976 run for the democratic presidential 
nomination but excited little interest in 1984 he was on 
democratic nominee walter mondales list of possible running mates 
one of the few white males in a field that included former san 
francisco mayor dianne feinstein and eventual pick geraldine 
ferraro 
on the negative side bentsen created a furor in february 1987 
when it was revealed that he had asked lobbyists to pay 10000 
apiece to join him for breakfast once a month 
the breakfast club called the chairmans council held one 
meeting and was quickly disbanded with bentsen promising to return 
the money collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists 
bentsen was born feb 11 1921 in mission texas the son of 
big lloyd bentsen who migrated to the rio grande valley after 
world war i and made himself wealthy as a rancher and by buying 
land and reselling it largely to midwest farmers who wanted to 
become citrus producers 
he received a law degree from the university of texas in 1942 
and joined the army air corps earning his pilots wings and flying 
bomber missions over the third reich he served as a hidalgo 
county texas judge from 1946 through 1948 when he was elected to 
the us house 
bentsen was a member of the house until 1955 when he retired to 
go into business and enhance his familys fortunes he took over 
the operation of a small insurance company and transformed it into 
a financial holding company increasing its size several times in 
the process 
he also kept his hand in texas politics serving as state 
finance chairman for lyndon b johnsons campaigns content with 
his business achievements bentsen reentered politics in 1970 
defeating liberal incumbent ralph yarborough in the primary and 
broadening his appeal in the general election to defeat bush 
bentsen could be of as much value off the ticket as on it he is 
up for reelection this year and his muchvaunted organization 
could make dukakis competitive in texas if bentsen leads the state 
office ticket 
as finance committee chairman bentsen presides over tax and 
trade legislation and this year was sponsor of a catastrophic 
health insurance bill 
record trade deficits in recent years combined with layoffs 
caused by import competition and resulting congressional ferment 
have put the focus on bentsen voluntary restraints on japanese 
auto shipments to the united states were imposed after he and sen 
john c danforth rmo offered legislation that would have made 
import curbs mandatory 
the bill was largely a gesture on their part and bentsen has 
most often been a critic of protectionism although in 1984 he did 
vote in favor of legislation to roll back asian textile imports 
but he staunchly opposed missouri rep richard a gephardts plan 
to force reductions in japanese trade surpluses with the united 
states and similar if less sharply spotlighted proposals 
instead he pushed for legislation that would leave the 
administration more flexibility to grapple with the nations trade 
problems 
as a texas lawmaker bentsen also has been in the forefront of 
the fight to repeal the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil industry 
earnings and to obtain other benefits for the homestate industry

a strong earthquake shook a wide area of 
northern california monday making skyscrapers sway and dumping 
cans and bottles from supermarket shelves but causing no injuries 
or serious damage 
the quake initially reported near 50 on the richter scale by 
several agencies was upgraded to 57 by the university of 
california seismographic stations at berkeley although other 
scientists kept to the lower figure a quake of that magnitude can 
cause considerable damage in populated areas 
all of a sudden there was this big noise said clerk judy 
young at a 7eleven convenience store at scotts valley stuff 
fell off the shelves a lot of stuff fell a couple of people had 
just left when it hit they were thrown up against the outside 
wall i thought they were fighting 
the quake which hit at 1143 am pdt was one of the strongest 
quakes along the san andreas fault since the 1906 temblor that 
destroyed much of san francisco according to robert uhrhammer at 
the university of california berkeley the san andreas fault the 
longest beneath the state annually produces dozens of quakes along 
its 650mile length 
us geological survey spokeswoman pat jorgenson said the 
epicenter was about 16 miles south of san jose 
the quake was felt over a large area extending from santa rosa 
about 60 miles north of san francisco to the monterey peninsula 
about 100 miles to the south it lasted up to 10 seconds in many 
areas 
although berkeley scientists upgraded their magnitude other 
agencies stuck by their lower estimate 
from our point of view it looks like 50 is a better 
estimated magnitude said geophysicist willis jacobs of the 
us geological surveys national earthquake information center in 
golden colo the agencys menlo park office also measured the 
quake at 50 
office workers in san francisco skyscrapers took the quake 
pretty much in stride in the landmark 48story transamerica 
pyramid building constructed to withstand far more powerful 
temblors workers said there was no sense of panic 
we just all kind of stood around and laughed said 
montgomery securities administrator racine linville from the 46th 
floor it wasnt so much the swaying sensation as it was you 
could tell there were two big jolts 
ginger johnson a receptionist for montgomery securities on the 
21st floor said our traders immediately started betting on how 
big it was 
the 38 trains that were running on bay area rapid transit lines 
were briefly halted to allow a check for track damage but were 
quickly returned to operation 
southern pacific halted freight trains and san francisco 
peninsula commuter trains under a company policy requiring a check 
of track following a quake of 50 or greater 
at the 20story federal building in san francisco attorney 
anthony smith was making his closing argument to a jury when the 
quake hit 
as you can see my argument is reaching the powers that be 
smith told the jurors according to associate reid dworkin who was 
in the courtroom he said a couple of spectators rushed out and 
us district judge d lowell jensen stopped the trial briefly 
tommy anderson a us marshals office employee on the 20th 
floor of the federal building said he was looking out the window 
at city hall i could see the building move in relation to other

to assassinate the pontiff was foiled in vienna

pope in st peters square in rome 
abc news in new york quoted unidentified sources as saying two 
turkish extremists were the prime suspects in the latest 
assassination plot in its 630 pm edt monday newscast abc said 
the attempt was to take place last thursday and that police 
believed the gunfire was to come from a construction site across 
from a cathedral where the pope said mass 
the austrian government confirmed that austrian antiterrorist 
police found photographs that show several sniper positions in 
the building plus firing angles to the square in front of st 
stephens cathedral according to abc 
the network said that a police raid at an islamic prayer 
building used mainly by turkish immigrants apparently foiled the 
plot 
abc said that mehmet ali agca the man who shot the pope in 
1981 and other members of a rightwing extremist group in turkey 
called the gray wolves from time to time sought sanctuary in the 
turkish quarter in vienna agca is serving a life term in a prison 
in rome 
the popes tour ended without incident 
leo lauber overnight police supervisor in vienna told the 
associated press in a telephone interview shortly after 3 am 
tuesday 9 pm edt monday i dont know anything about this i 
dont know anything about two turks being prime suspects in such a 
plot

would only be available once the police day shift comes on duty

hans schengersbauer overnight supervisor at the interior 
ministry in vienna told the ap i havent heard of any such 
thing that sounds like a madeup story to me the interior 
ministry oversees many police and security functions in austria 
schengersbauer said that he had not been informed of every 
detail of the papal visit but that as far as he knew it went off 
without incident 
surely if something like that had happened it would have 
come out in the news media before he said 
in ankara the turkish capital overnight duty officers at the 
interior ministry and the state security department told the ap 
they had no information on any such plot 
in rome repeated telephone calls to the vatican press office 
and the home of vatican spokesman joaquin navarro were unanswered 
on his last day in austria john paul spoke against bitter 
confrontations that cause divisions in christianity and the 
church 
some jewish leaders objected to his meetings with waldheim who 
has been accused of involvement in war crimes while serving as a 
german army officer in world war ii he denies wrongdoing 
a looming schism prompted by activities of traditionalist french 
archbishop marcel lefebvre which would be the first split in the 
roman catholic church for more than a century is one of several 
items awaiting john paul at the vatican 
he is to elevate 24 new cardinals tuesday and will announce a 
major reform of the curia the church administration the 
68yearold pontiff ended his fiveday visit at innsbruck site of 
the 1964 and 1976 winter olympics 
standing on the airport runway he thanked waldheim for your 
kind words of farewell and for the warm and generous hospitality 
which your country and its people have again extended to me then 
added 
cherish and deepen above all the great good of unity and of 
the common profession of faith in sincerity and mutual love 
during his second trip to this predominantly catholic nation of 
75 million people john paul repeatedly emphasized that christians 
as well as jews suffered at nazi hands 
recalling another part of his trip the pontiff also said monday 
he was especially happy tens of thousands of east european 
catholics were able to attend his masses in austria most were from 
hungary and yugoslavia 
he has been permitted to visit his native poland but not the 
other communistruled nations of europe 
waldheim also mentioned the nazi past in his parting remarks 
the somber walls of the concentration camp of mauthausen 
forcefully remind us of the martyrs of our own time waldheim 
said of the concentration camp the pontiff visited friday he 
called the walls relics of a shameful period of our century 
a light rain fell as two talked and when the shower had passed 
a rainbow colored the sky the pontiffs redandwhite austrian 
airlines dc9 left for rome at 657 pm threading its way through 
the craggy snowcovered tyrolean peaks 
john paul drew repeated lessons from the nazi horrors during his 
tour beginning with mention of the burdensome legacy of the 
past during a meeting with waldheim soon after he arrived 
waldheim 69 was un secretarygeneral from 1972 to 1982 and 
allegations about his wartime activities arose during the 
presidential campaign two years ago 
an international panel of historians appointed by the austrian 
government concluded that he knew of nazi atrocities while serving 
as a german officer in the balkans and did nothing to stop them 
but its report left open the question of personal guilt

israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin said 
monday he expects the reagan administration to approve joint 
development with israel of a new surfacetoair missile to counter 
a threat posed by the supply of soviet and chinese missiles to arab 
countries 
we have to be capable to cope with this new threat rabin 
said after a meeting at the white house with senior reagan 
administration officials 
he said israel could not stop the soviet union and china from 
supplying the missiles to arab foes and that us efforts to 
persuade them to stop had also failed 
as a result rabin said he had urged the administration to 
approve joint production and development of the arrow missile 
as a countermeasure 
there wasnt agreement in the past about the arrow program 
the israeli official told reporters after meeting with defense 
secretary frank c carlucci secretary of state george p shultz 
and colin powell the presidents national security adviser 
but rabin said i hope everything will be circled by 
tomorrow 
the soviet union has moved closer to resuming diplomatic ties 
with israel and has improved its relations with the united states 
even so rabin said the soviets supplied missiles to syria iraq 
and libya while china sold a new missile to saudi arabia 
for us its a new strategic threat rabin said he cited 
also the use of chemical weapons by iran and iraq and the 
legitimization given this kind of warfare 
i brought up all these issues the ways that we as israelis 
would like to cope with it and to find out to what extent certain 
projects in which we agreed in the past can get more impetus 
towards the future he said 
in past wars he said the arab nations air forces could not 
penetrate israeli air defenses and reach population centers 
missiles can reach and no doubt the situation can be aggravated 
if chemical war will be added to the missiles rabin said 
we first would like to be in a position to have the capability 
to defend the population of israel the armed forces of israel and 
then to destroy the means that might threaten israel once a war 
starts he said 
the israeli official is on a semiannual visit to washington to 
develop the strategic ties that bind the united states with its 
leading middle eastern ally 
on the human rights situation on the west bank which is also on 
the agenda for rabins visit carlucci said we did have some 
discussions on disturbances taking place and the israelis are very 
much aware of our position 
that is carlucci said we do not support beatings or 
deportations but we do recognize that the israelis have a security 
responsibility on the west bank 
rabin as defense minister is trying to control the volatile 
situation in the west bank and gaza where palestinian arabs have 
demonstrated against israeli control since last december 
richard schifter the assistant secretary of state for human 
rights has criticized israel for what schifter called clear 
human rights violations and called for a new system of reviewing 
appeals by palestinians who claim they were mistreated by israeli 
soldiers 
state department spokesman charles e redman disputed however 
reports that schifter is urging joint usisraeli monitoring of 
the situation in the territories 
redman said a channel of communication between the two 
countries was what schifter had proposed 
in the meantime the palestine liberation organization with 
strong arab support has promoted an uprising on the west bank 
and in gaza to try to wrest the area from israeli control 
kuwait and saudi arabia oilrich countries in the persian gulf 
have committed themselves to contribute 50 million to the plo 
treasury to keep the unrest going palestinian representatives 
reported saturday in beirut lebanon 
rabin and israeli foreign minister shimon peres both supported 
shultzs attempt to arrange a peace conference that would be aimed 
also at arab recognition of israel but shamir refused to provide 
the assurances sought by jordans king hussein through shultz that 
israel would surrender the west bank and gaza 
rabin is seeing carlucci and president reagan and congressional 
leaders on tuesday 
carlucci at a dinner for rabin on monday night at fort mcnair 
said we think of ourselves as your partners we have a common 
sense of purpose 
the us defense secretary mindful of the november presidential 
elections said this country no matter what administration is 
in power will always be a friend and supporter of israel

aixenprovence france ap a french court on monday put off 
until a later date haitis legal efforts to recover 120 million 
allegedly taken by dictator jeanclaude duvalier when he fled to 
france a court official said 
the official who was not identified in keeping with french 
practice said an investigating magistrate will be named to 
determine a new hearing date after consulting lawyers for the 
haitian government and duvalier 
duvalier who fled here during antigovernment demonstrations in 
april 1986 is accused of misappropriating at least 120 million in 
public funds 
attorney yann colin representing the haitian goverment told 
reporters that gen henri namphys seizure of power june 20 in 
haiti would not interrupt the judicial procedure begun in france by 
haiti 
we are not the lawyers of the government but of the state of 
haiti colin said we maintain our power as its legal 
representative 
in april a french court ruled it had juridsiction in the case 
against duvalier 
according to judicial sources who by practice cannot be 
identified a household budget sheet seized during the course of 
the investigation shows that duvalier and his wife michele 
continue to enjoy a comfortable life style 
the sources said the information could undermine the duvaliers 
lawyers claim that the couple left all their money in haiti and do 
not have any funds elsewhere to spend 
according to the budget sheet mrs duvalier spent 5000 on 
nov 27 for sweaters for her husband referred to as tonton in 
the accounts which in familiar french means uncle 
another entry shows 5600 for a dress and 1300 for shoes for 
the couples two children 
according to the accounts in some months the couples 
expenditures are substantial there are unexplained entries in 
december 1987 for 287000 and 28000 
the sources said the accounts are quite detailed and show that 
mrs duvalier kept a separate ledger for herself they show that 
from july 1987 to january 1988 she spent 83000 on jewelry 
mrs duvalier according to the accounts is also apparently 
responsible for the daytoday running of the house paying gas 
telephone and electricty bills 
for example she paid out 3314 in international telephone 
calls and 1060 in local telephone calls in november 1987 
many of these expenditures the accounts show were made in cash 
but there were other notations showing that mrs duvalier 
transferred funds to relatives apparently to make purchases for the 
couple 
since arriving in france on feb 7 1986 duvalier his wife and 
other family members have lived in a mansion in southern france 
rented from saudi businessman adnan kashoggi 
duvalier has consistently declined to coment on political 
developments in haiti since his downfall he has said he is without 
resources

barge traffic moved again monday on most of the sandbarclogged 
mississippi but there were new blockages as barges ran aground in 
low water and even heavy thunderstorms in parts of the south 
didnt alleviate the worst drought since dust bowl days 
its been refreshing and its helped but we need more to end 
the drought said danny cooper director of the alabama emergency 
management agency 
the drought also will spoil some fourth of july plans for 
fireworks in at least two states 
wisconsin gov tommy g thompson announced he planned to issue 
an executive order tuesday banning fireworks open fires and even 
sparklers because of tinderdry conditions he said the ban is 
necessary because of the threat of accidental forest grass and 
brush fires and the potential for loss of lives 
iowa fire officials also said they are worrying about hot embers 
from sky rockets touching off fires and some fireworks displays 
have been called off 
after more than a week of record heat from the plains to the 
ohio valley blamed for at least 11 deaths cool air washed down 
across the great lakes and monday morning was marked by a few 
record lows 44 at jackson mich 49 at parkersburg wva and 45 
at toledo ohio the national weather service said 
hot air did edge its way back onto the northern plains on monday 
with a record 102 at bismarck nd and a recordtying 100 at 
rapid city sd far to the south meridian miss hit a record 
102 and pensacola fla had a record 101 
by contrast the weather service in seattle warned people 
planning to be in the higher elevations of the olympic and cascade 
mountains to watch for snow and freezing temperatures with the 
arrival of cold air from the gulf of alaska 
showers and thunderstorms supplied moisture monday morning 
across the southern states from the carolinas into new mexico 
including 221 inches in just three hours at ira texas the 
weather service said 
on sunday thunderstorms and showers were scattered from the 
southeast into the southern plains with as much as 375 inches at 
dothan ala some of those storms had damaging wind lightning and 
hail and five people were killed 
in oklahoma the rainfall has been enough to ease the drought 
but its not broken said weather service meteorologist gary 
szatkowski eastern sections normally have 20 to 25 inches of rain 
by this time of year but some havent gotten 10 inches yet 
leakey texas west of san antonio got that 10 inches in four 
days over the weekend but if we dont continue to have more 
during the rest of the summer we will be looking at a very bad 
fall said betty sansom who lives on a ranch north of leakey 
mississippi gov ray mabus made a whirlwind helicopter tour of 
droughtstricken timber and agricultural operations monday and said 
the damage was more devastating than i thought it would be he 
said the mississippi river looks like a stream flowing through 
the desert 
the scientist who popularized the greenhouse effect theory 
believes the drought is not a symptom of the gradual warming of the 
atmosphere he predicted as a result of air pollution even though 
he would love to be able to say i told you so 
stephen schneider who heads the climate systems unit of the 
national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo said 
sunday he believes the drought more likely has been caused by the 
jet stream swinging well north of its usual track 
this year the jet stream jumped north to canada depriving 
the middle of the country of rain leaving hot weather in the south 
and lowering watersheds further 
on the mississippi river 20 feet below normal at some points

stopping small groups of tows which will have to wait for the 
roadblock to be removed said coast guard lt richard muth such 
groundings can occur even in good conditions in the evershifting 
river 
the corps of engineers said monday it will keep traffic moving 
on the ohio river for the next 60 to 80 days even if there is no 
rain thanks to its system of locks and dams and water released 
from flood control reservoirs though barges will have to carry 
lighter loads 
its like the reverse of flood control said col richard 
w anderchat deputy commander of the corps if it werent for 
the dams there wouldnt be a single barge moving between cairo 
ill and pittsburgh

in nearly 5 years as a top navy official 
melvyn r paisley gained a reputation both as a hardnosed 
administrator with little tolerance for functionaries and a bon 
vivant who loved a good party 
with his stylish young wife at his side the 63yearold paisley 
now a key figure in the defense department bribery case seemed 
to make an impression on just about everyone with whom he worked or 
socialized according to former colleagues and acquaintances 
hes an affable person but he is tough as nails said a 
former navy official who worked with paisley but did not want his 
name used colorful is the way people describe mel another 
official said 
but paisley had his detractors at the navy where he became 
assistant secretary for research engineering and systems in 1981 
after a 28year career with boeing co in seattle 
with john f lehman jr as navy secretary paisley joined a 
small coterie of men who oversaw the massive buildup of the navy to 
600 ships paisley supervised procurement specializing in 
acquisition of aircraft and combat systems 
there are lots of people in the navy who dont like him just 
as they dont like lehman conceded paisleys lawyer e lawrence 
barcella but he attributed those feelings to sour grapes over the 
lehmanpaisley effort to streamline costs and revitalize navy 
procurement 
but james durst a former boeing executive said paisley had a 
tarnished reputation before he joined the government 
usually every major company has one guy who does the dirty 
business durst said he was the guy 
durst said he told the government in the early 1980s that 
paisley while at boeing bragged of committing a felony 
wiretapping operation and bribing people overseas for military 
contracts 
barcella dismissed allegations made by durst and paisleys 
exwife mildred mcgetrick of spokane wash she told the los 
angeles times that she had informed the fbi in mid1981 that 
paisley took gratuities and was dishonest with money 
going to disgruntled exemployees and exwives thats more 
than scraping the bottom of the barrel barcella said thats 
tilting it over and looking underneath 
he noted that both the fbi and the senate investigated paisley 
before his confirmation in november 1981 
the fbi confirmed it conducted a routine background check on 
paisley and furnished it to the white house contents of the 
investigation are confidential fbi spokeswoman sue schnitzer said 
barcella has answered calls on behalf of paisley and his fourth 
wife vicki since the initial reports that fbi agents had searched 
paisleys office in their investigation into allegations that 
defense contractors and consultants bribed pentagon officials to 
obtain classified material vital for winning multibilliondollar 
contracts no one has been charged in the probe 
the washington post reported in tuesdays editions that federal 
investigators found stacks of classified federal documents that 
paisley had no security clearance to possess when they searched his 
home and office the post cited informed officials for the 
information 
an engineer by training paisley listed himself in government 
biography as a 1953 graduate of the american institute of 
technology and a 1954 graduate of the massachusetts institute of 
technology mit said paisley attended one semester 
paisley and lehman socialize together and live four houses apart 
in an exclusive mclean va neighborhood the two men had formed a 
friendship before president reagans election when boeing hired 
lehmans military consulting firm abington corp for 350000 a 
year according to a report published in the new york times in 1983 
law enforcement officials have said lehman now a managing 
director at paine webber inc is not a target of the 
investigation but investigators have evidence suggesting lehman 
may have tipped paisley about the inquiry lehman has refused to be 
interviewed 
paisley left government in march 1987 to form a defense 
consulting business with an office in the watergate complex near 
the office of his friend william galvin another defense 
consultant who is under investigation 
sources told the los angeles times last week that as a 
consultant paisley and his wife copied secret documents and 
paisley then allegedly passed the information to his major client 
mcdonnell douglas corp 
other sources said james gaines a deputy navy secretary who 
worked with paisley at boeing in the 1970s is believed to be one 
of the people who passed the information to paisley all of the 
sources talked on condition their names not be used paisleys 
other clients included bdm international inc a defense 
contractor and united technologies corp 
barcella said he would not comment on the allegations until he 
has seen the evidence 
this is not the first time paisley has attracted the justice 
departments interest he was one of several former boeing 
officials sued for receiving improper severance payments paisleys 
golden handshake at boeing amounting to 183000 is still 
tied up in the courts 
while paisley managed the navys weaponsbuying his wife went 
to work in 1983 for bdm which hired paisley as a consultant when 
he resigned from the government 
in 1986 mrs paisley had several sources of income according 
to her husbands financial disclosure form she received 
unspecified amounts from bdm town and country real estate and 
from vamo inc a company in vienna va the paisleys friend 
william galvin was on vamos original board of directors public

jack montgomery has a bunch of hard workers on 
his northwest georgia farm but they havent done much lately 
except stay home and fan themselves 
its the danged drought the 68yearold beekeeper said 
all the flowers have died north georgias honey production 
should be at its peak right now but its already stopped for the 
year 
so instead of spending these summer days collecting nectar and 
making honey montgomerys bees are trying to beat the heat which 
was expected to reach only the upper 80s today after hovering near 
100 degrees for the past week or so 
the bees actually air condition their hives when it gets this 
hot he said last week they deposit little droplets of water 
along the top of the honey frames and then fan their wings causing 
it to evaporate and cool the hive 
then they move the cool air throughout the hive and take it 
out the door when it starts to heat up they keep repeating the 
process all day long

to an uncertain and divided electorate 
michael dukakis is a blank page whose lead over george bush is 
grounded in negative feelings about the republican vice president 
rather than positive attitudes toward the democratic nomineetobe 
according to a survey released today 
the national poll did find democrats remarkably united behind 
dukakis at this point although there are weaknesses in the 
coalition that bush could exploit to build his chances for a fall 
victory 
much of dukakis strength comes from voters worried about the 
course of the nation 
democrats are seen as the party of change bush is not said

the poll for the timesmirror corp

a new airbus 320 that crashed at an air show was 
flying too low for the load it carried and the pilot did not have 
time to maneuver it out of danger officials said monday following 
a preliminary investigation 
three passengers were killed and 50 injured as the jetlinger 
crashed into the woods sunday during a demonstration flight near 
mulhouse in eastern france 
daniel tennenbaum chief of the civil aviation authority said 
the air france jet was flying at 30 feet 
in mulhouse prosecutor jean volff said the a320 passed at 30 
feet altitude which is completely outside the technical norms when 
it is carrying passengers 
he said the normal minimum altitude for such conditions was 100 
feet and added without giving details that the pilot had 
disconnected the automatic controls at the moment of the accident 
and was in manual control 
tennenbaum told a news conference in paris the fully 
computerized aircraft needed eight seconds to respond to the 
command of pilot michel hasseline and only five seconds were 
available because of the low altitude

communities may ban picketing aimed 
specifically at someones home the supreme court ruled by a 63 
vote monday 
the court saying there simply is no right to force speech 
into the home of an unwilling listener ruled that such bans do 
not necessarily violate freespeech rights 
but the justices unanimously rejected arguments that public 
streets in residential neighborhoods are not the type of 
traditional public forum where freedom of expression is protected 
the court therefore said communities may not ban pickets from 
marching through a residential neighborhood or even walking back 
and forth along a block on which the home they want to target is 
located 
the decision is a defeat for antiabortion activists who were 
barred from picketing a doctors home in the milwaukee suburb of

now that the baltic ice has melted 
its submarine season once again for sweden the time of year 
when unidentified underwater objects make pests of themselves 
the season has been rolling around in swedish territorial waters 
every year since 1981 when a soviet submarine allegedly snooping 
ran aground outside the karlskrona naval base 
experts who investigated another engagement in 1982 determined 
the intruder also was a soviet sub and sweden lodged a diplomatic 
protest with moscow 
but no snooping sub has ever been captured or so far as anyone 
knows laid to rest on the bottom 
the government is strengthening its antisubmarine forces 
nevertheless four new corvettes and a mine detector are being 
added to the current fleet of two corvettes 16 older patrol boats 
12 submarines one reconnaissance plane 12 helicopters and six 
mine detectors 
in addition 339 million have been allocated to antisubmarine 
warfare above the regular defense budget set through 1992 
prime minister ingvar carlsson a stalwart of swedens 
traditional peace and neutrality policy told reporters last year 
that blood will flow if the navy gets its sights on a foreign 
intruder 
nowadays swedish ships and aircraft bombard suspected intruders 
with depth charges mines and other weapons 
a pamphlet published by the national defense staff titled our 
uninvited visitors tells fishermen and other coastal dwellers 
what to do if they sight periscopes hundreds of people report 
sightings each year 
since 1982 however no snooping submarine has been identified 
by nationality 
so far this year swedish ships and helicopters have used live 
ammunition in nine separate chases of submarines along the 
countrys 4750mile coastline 
this was the first year since 1984 that the navy exploded any of 
the 660 to 1980pound remotecontrolled mines scattered around 
its bases and harbors according to the armed forces spokesman 
hg wessberg 
the results so far two confirmed hits of subshaped undersea 
rocks and one possible hit of a submarine which supposedly escaped 
in the roiling waters after the attack 
that submarine was exactly where we thought it was and the 
weapons were very close wessberg said in an interview we 
think we might have scored some minor damage 
the risk for the intruders is rising gradually not much but 
its rising 
since swedens coastline equals about half the distance of the 
front between the wests nato military alliance and the east blocs 
warsaw pact hostilities in these waters are of interest to both of 
those military sides 
swedish officials are careful however not to single out either 
side for the intrusions in keeping with the countrys neutrality 
but most swedes seem to believe the soviets are the main culprits 
in any case sweden doesnt care who is snooping or why said 
wessberg what matters is that somebody is there who shouldnt be 
there 
the main problem he said is that swedens geography makes it 
one of the most difficult places in the world to hunt submarines 
the coastline is dotted with thousands of rocks and islands subs 
can hide behind rivers running into the shallow baltic make layers 
of difference in its salt content and temperature foiling sonar 
and other detection gear 
the sea bottom is also littered with metallic junk and natural 
chunks of iron ore that offer undersea camouflage it is estimated 
that at least one in every 10 swedes owns a boat so civilian water 
traffic is heavy and often noisy 
the navy loosened its rules of engagement this year giving 
commanders greater leeway to fire without warning 
we would rather shoot the rock too much than miss a submarine 
as long as there is no danger to civilian traffic said thomas 
gur another defense spokesman 
stress has to be made that we are shooting to kill or at 
least liquidate the boat

a 1500mile defensive wall has 
brought stalemate to the 12yearold polisario guerrilla war to 
wrest control of the western sahara from morocco 
the guerrillas say they hold out little hope for an outright 
military victory 
they now talk of compromise in their campaign for an independent 
nation in the former spanish colony in northwest africa 
nevertheless refugees remain keyed up for war in teeming polisario 
camps near the algerian border where military training begins in 
primary school and their slogan the entire nation or 
martyrdom is everywhere 
they have been fighting for independence since 1976 when spain 
relinquished what then was the spanish sahara to joint moroccan and 
mauritanian control 
mauritania withdrew from the conflict in 1979 but morocco 
maintained the fight to hold its sovereignty over the territory 
which is about the size of colorado and is rich in phosphates and 
possibly potash and iron ore 
morocco began building its defensive wall of rock and sand in 
1980 now completed it is studded with concrete bunkers and 
usmade sensors to detect infiltrators 
almost all of moroccos 100000man army is deployed along the 
wall and guerrilla attacks behind it have virtually stopped 
talking to visiting western reporters in their camp at akuadim 
the guerrillas acknowledged that their liberation struggle has 
degenerated into a series of brief hitandrun assaults on moroccan 
defenses 
bachir sayed a member of polisarios sevenmember executive 
committee told the visitors we dont want to defeat morocco we 
want to create a different situation that will bring 
moroccos king hassan ii to the bargaining table 
the guerrillas suffered a serious blow in may when algeria 
which has supported the polisario front restored the diplomatic 
relations it broke with morocco over the issue 
algerian officials now are hinting that polisario might accept 
some kind of autonomy under moroccan sovereignty but the 
guerrillas have not acknowledged this is their intent 
their main sanctuary now is in the stark hilly desert around 
the oasis of tindouf inside algeria 
the last algerian checkpoint is three miles outside tindouf 
after that are camps for more than 100000 refugees followed along 
the road by miles of sand and shrub the comes the battle zone 
that stretches across algerias border into a no mans land leading 
to the moroccan wall 
polisario has built hospitals and military schools in the zone 
but the guerrillas say they intend to abandon the area whenever 
they return to the moroccanheld phosphate mines and fishing 
ports on the atlantic coast 
when spanish colonial rule ended the territorys population 
comprised 80000 tribal nomads roaming the desert with camels and 
goats 
polisario claims to have 16000 heavily armed guerrillas 
operating in the desert moroccan officers estimate guerrilla 
strength at fewer than 4000 
abba deddi a 23yearold polisario guerrilla said he could not 
imagine being anything in life but a soldier 
i want to remain a soldier even after the liberation to fight 
against any new colonialist attempts he said 
out in the battle zone a fivehour drive from tindouf across a 
featureless desert a group of uniformed guerrillas played cards on 
a blanket surrounded by empty artillery shells scattered on the 
sand they were desert men ranging from 18yearold recruits to 
veterans of the spanish foreign legion 
artillery fire thudded in the distance as the moroccans 
responded to an attack on the wall by another polisario unit 
the firing stopped abruptly 
thats all said omar mohammed the unit commander we 
give them 10 minutes every two or three hours it keeps them on 
their toes 
mohammed said his forces frequently cross the moroccan wall 
after disabling its radar system the moroccans claim not a single 
attack has even reached the walls outer defenses since last summer 
we have the advantage of knowing the desert and of speed 
mohammed said we dismantle the mines cut the barbed wire cross 
in capture weapons take prisoners and retreat 
omar khatry director of a polisario military training school 
said the wall built up moroccan confidence and stopped our 
attacks somewhat he claimed however that new tactics enabled 
the guerrillas to develop a full war of attrition but didnt 
elaborate 
in an effort to assure an everincreasing saharan population 
polisario war widows are required to remarry after a fourmonth 
waiting period 
i have to continue having children said one recent bride 
ghaluha elsalma whose husband died in the polisario ranks and 
left her with a daughter

never underestimate the power of the pen 
particularly when its in the hand of an irate television viewer 
whose favorite show has just been canceled 
at least 2800 people have written to nbc to express their 
disappointment with the cancellation of a year in the life 
television critics have similar letters the associated press 
received about 50 urging the return of the show next fall 
i know that 4000 people have written me about a year in the 
life said dorothy swanson of fairfax va director of viewers 
for quality television vqt is the nations leading organizer of 
mail campaigns and in the past has saved such shows as cbs 
cagney amp lacey and designing women 
im getting an average of 200 letters a day i think if 4000 
people care enough to write to me they will also write to nbc 
this mail exceeds what i received in the designing women campaign 
and is approaching our world an abc news show viewers are very 
upset people are passionate about this show people are tired of 
losing quality shows 
brandon tartikoff president of nbc entertainment said his 
network had never reversed a cancellation because of viewer mail 
but that doesnt mean we dont look at the mail he said our 
decisions regarding shows are not set in stone its just that 
weve never reversed ourselves yet 
tartikoff said the most mail nbc had ever received was after it 
dropped little house on the prairie after 10 years he did not 
recall the number of letters 
other canceled show such as nbcs days and nights of molly 
dodd and aarons way and abcs the slap maxwell story are 
also drawing mail but not in large amounts 
the networks do respond to viewer mail designing women was 
getting good ratings on monday nights then in december 1986 cbs 
moved it to thursday against nbcs night court in two weeks it 
dropped from 20th in the ratings to 63rd cbs pulled the show off 
the air 
swansons vqt members wrote 50000 letters to cbs and the show 
went back on the air and became a hit again 
we certainly do look at all viewer mail said david 
poltrack vice president for marketing at cbs while volume is 
important we differentiate significantly between mail that is 
coming in an unorganized way from a large number of viewers from 
that mail which is part of an organized campaign if we get a lot 
of letters that are the same we are somewhat skeptical of the 
depth of the feeling 
when we feel we have a significant amount of viewer mail on a 
subject we try to confirm what they are trying to tell us through 
scientific research at the end of the season we got a lot of mail 
about wiseguy this is a program whose future was in doubt we 
noted that we were getting a strong support we didnt take that 
alone as an indication of the shows potential we also interviewed 
a random sample of people and discussed with them their views 
toward wiseguy we learned it had a very loyal audience 
in january 1984 cagney amp lacey rose from the ashes to become 
a hit and pick up numerous emmy awards the previous season cbs had 
canceled the show but in the reruns cagney amp lacey suddenly 
became a winner and led cbs to three straight victories in the 
nielsen ratings 
cbs changed its mind because of the ratings turnaround because 
the press lobbied for its return and because the public flooded the 
network with mail asking for its return 
it was the first time a network had put a canceled show back on 
the air because of viewer reaction since abc brought back the law 
and mr jones in 1962 that reprieve lasted only six months 
viewers had less success with our world which abc dropped a 
year ago despite an enormous mail campaign abc declined to bring 
the show back and host linda ellerbee left the network she is now 
trying to reprise the show on public television 
last year abc lost a large number of demographically valued 
viewers who had watched our world these people have gone back to 
watching pbs and cable said swanson 
i think nbc had a valuable demographic audience with a year 
in the life are they willing to throw these people away 
tartikoff said canceling a year in the life was the single most 
difficult decision he had to make if he feels that way then 
bringing it back should be easy

international celebrities including 
music star paul simon have joined in a campaign to save the 
worlds largest example of portuguese colonial architecture in 
downtown salvador one of the western hemispheres oldest cities 
the 91acre district is now a slum 
it is called pelourinho the portuguese word for pillory 
stemming from salvadors former slave trade 
pelourinhos largely abandoned facades line the narrow streets 
of the city that also was brazils first capital and sometimes is 
known to outsiders as bahia the name of the coastal citys state 
in addition to paul simon other international celebrities 
involved in the campaign include the spanish crooner julio iglesias 
nd akio morito president of the sony corp 
of the districts 978 buildings some dating as far back as the 
1500s 300 are close to collapse 48 are in ruins and about 10 
slide down hillsides every year in seasonal rainstorms according 
to maria del carmen coordinator of the savepelourinho campaign 
pelourinhos spacious mansions housed the elite when salvador 
was until 1763 the capital of portugals vast south american 
colony today it is a skid row home to prostitutes drug dealers 
and muggers 
pelourinho must be the worlds largest baroque slum said 
the bahia state secretary for culture gilberto gil who also is a 
popular singer and composer there are people in this city who 
havent dared venture into pelourinho for the past 20 years 
but for the first time authorities encouraged by private 
business have launched a massive campaign to clean up the winding 
streets and halfcollapsed mansions which in 1987 were designated 
by unesco as part of mankinds cultural heritage the buildings 
are protected from demolition by a local decree 
if we dont do something now the whole beautiful area will be 
completely irrecoverable in 10 years said ms del carmen an 
engineer 
but conversely it was after the unesco designation that the 
colonial buildings arcades courtyards and cobblestone streets 
began fell into greater disarray 
landlords refused to invest in their properties which were 
inhabited by tenants who could pay almost no rent gil said 
and they werent allowed to tear down their buildings so the 
strategy was to let the buildings literally fall down with 
tenants inside them 
so far the socalled historical park of pelourinho operating 
with 150 functionaries borrowed from various municipal government 
offices has raised the equivalent of about 7 million in 
government grants and loans ms del carmen said but organizers 
hope a media campaign that began in february directed at foreign 
and domestic business communities will bring in much more 
morita simon and iglesias are featured in 60second public 
service announcements asking for donations and encouraging 
businesses to invest in the area 
we need brazilians and others to feel responsible for the 
area to understand that brazil was born here and want to leave 
this for their children ms del carmen said most of the 
people who actually live here exist in subhuman conditions and 
could care less about pelourinho 
black groups have been some of the most active in rallying to 
save the decaying center as part of a slow but growing 
blackconsciousness movement in mixedrace brazil 
pelourinho was a major port of entry for slaves from africa from 
the 1500s through 1888 when slavery was abolished in brazil one 
of the areas most beautiful buildings the rosary of the blacks 
church was built over a period of 150 years by and for slaves 
every stone here was laid with the sweat of blacks said an 
area resident known only as zoinho we have to save this 
area its a monument to our suffering 
paulo de jesus 18 lives with his father and four brothers and 
sisters in two rooms of a massively subdivided old home he was 
born in pelourinho 
i wouldnt leave this place he said this is my home but 
if you knocked down our old home and built an apartment building in 
its place wed be much happier 
some residents are worried that increased property values will 
drive out longtime inhabitants 
we have to make sure we dont turn pelourinho into a picture 
postcard ms del carmen said the sense of community here is 
rich and very strong we need to bring in jobs schools health 
facilities and give people the chance to appreciate the fabulous 
historicl setting

in the final days of a presidential race 
theyre expected to lose mexicos opposition parties are stepping 
up their claims that the government and ruling party will steal 
victory from them 
carlos salinas de gortari the man virtually guaranteed victory 
as candidate of the governments institutional revolutionary party 
is hammering just as hard at his claim that he will win wednesday 
in a clean election 
opposition parties long have accused the dominant pri as it is 
commonly called of stuffing or stealing ballot boxes and other 
forms of vote fraud 
but the charges are being hurled with more force and frequency 
than in past campaigns for the nations top office this years 
opposition is presenting the pri with its biggest presidential 
challenge since the 1950s at a time when its candidate is seen as 
weakened by mexicos economic crisis and general discontent 
in a change from the past salinas de gortari has acknowledged 
that a fraud problem exists juan enriquez his spokesman says the 
need for a clean election is one of the top issues in his campaign 
it is not only the pri presidential candidate who rejects 
obsolete practices and electoral trickery it is the majority of 
mexicans salinas de gortari said in a speech april 22 
let us hold clean clear elections you can be sure that 
we will defend our victories but we will equally accept our 
defeats he said 
cuauhtemoc cardenas a former state governor who led a dissident 
movement in the pri and broke away to become candidate of nearly 
all the leftist parties said recently he saw much evidence of 
preparation of a fraud of enormous dimensions 
manuel j clouthier candidate of the conservative national 
action party has charged that electoral fraud has been prepared 
throughout the country 
the problem is that the tendency of fraud and the real 
interests that would be affected by a clean election could be more 
powerful than a mere desire for honesty by salinas de gortari 
jorge g castaneda a wellknown author and political scientist 
wrote in the current issue of the magazine nexos 
opposition leaders say the pris repertoire of means of fraud is 
vast ranging from inflating the voter registration lists to giving 
workers ballots already marked for the pri 
all the cemeteries in mexico city are on the registration 
lists charged porfirio munoz ledo a former head of the pri and 
ambassador to the united nations who with cardenas organized the 
dissident movement known as the democratic current 
in rural areas where opposition representatives usually are not 
present at the polls they fill the boxes as they want he 
added 
said raul trejo of the national universitys institute for 
social research there are municipalities in the country where 
the pri has gotten 100 percent of the votes or more where the 
vote was greater than the registration list 
opposition leaders contend that manipulation of the process is 
not limited to election day and they have complained loudly that 
voter registration was closed as long before the election as dec 
31 
enriquez the pri candidates spokesman said the reason was to 
give parties six months to check their copies of the electoral 
rolls 
while by law all parties are allotted radio and television time 
national action particularly has complained that some stations 
wouldnt sell it time or cancelled interviews 
virtually all television stations in mexico are either 
governmentowned or closely aligned with the government including 
the major televisa private network 
the other two candidates rosario ibarra de piedra of the 
trotskyite revolutionary workers party and gumersindo magana of 
the conservative mexican democratic party have complained of 
similar problems 
enriquez says the opposition parties raise accusations of fraud 
to excuse their losses 
it is very difficult in fact impossible i think to show 
that theres a massive systematic change of the voting patterns of 
the population he said 
opposition parties say their main defense will be to try to have 
representatives at all the polling places this time although it 
can be difficult in the remote mountain regions of the country 
clouthier has urged the mexican army to prevent fraud and called 
repeatedly for civil disobedience if irregularities show up 
cardenas says his parties will use popular mobilization 
essentially the same thing 
with its extensive grassroots system of organization among rural 
people labor and other sectors and government benefits such as 
housing and health care the pri in most cases can win without 
resorting to what is popularly known here as alchemy 
it would be naive to say that there are not electoral frauds 
in mexico francisco baez rodriguez an economics professor at 
the national university said in an article in nexos 
but it is equally naive to pretend that the dominance of the 
pri finds its main sustenance in fraud at least in federal 
elections

unable to turn back the advancing sahara 
desert or stop periodic droughts niger has turned to family 
planning to control population growth and reduce pressure on its 
fragile resources 
the northcentral african nation has only 68 million people in 
an area twice the size of france but it cant feed itself and at 
its current growth rate the population will double in 23 years 
three and a half years ago the government strongly endorsed 
family planning an unprecedented move in this largely moslem area 
of africa just below the sahara and in april it legalized 
contraception 
the legalization of contraception is concrete proof of the 
governments support for family planning said dr halima 
maidouka diallo director of family planning in the ministry of 
health 
to counter african traditions in favor of large families and 
avoid potential clashes with some interpretations of the koran the 
moslems holy book the government presented family planning as a 
necessary move to reduce infant and maternal mortality 
nigers infant mortality rate of 135 deaths per 1000 births and 
maternal mortality rate of 7 deaths per 1000 births are among the 
highest in the world 
for a woman to be valued here she must have many children as 
soon as possible children help with work and are considered life 
insurance maidouka said 
women are considered wicked if they do not produce children 
she added 
customarily if a woman doesnt bear children a husband will 
look for another wife 
because many infants die mothers bear many children it is not 
unusual for a mother to have 15 children with only five surviving 
the frequent births become both a cause and effect women become 
pregnant again as soon as possible after delivery without time to 
fully recover and often give birth prematurely to infants who have 
little chance of surviving 
it also creates problems in schools where many young girls 
become pregnant the average age for marriage for women is about 
15 
some women seek abortions clandestinely as they are not legal 
here or go to neighboring countries 
at least once a month there is a case of a baby being 
strangled and tossed in a trash can maidouka said 
she added that suicides are also a problem among women with 
unwanted pregnancies 
the family planning program seeks to offer women an alternative 
a child if i want when i want says a poster displayed 
throughout the countrys main family planning center 
the center built with funding from the united nations has a 
large poster explaining various contraception methods the 
explanations are accompanied by explicit diagrams showing among 
other things how to use a condom 
the diagrams are necessary in a nation where only 44 percent of 
the women are literate and only 20 percent of children go to 
primary schools 
dr voahangi ravao of malagasy a staff associate of the 
columbia university center for population and family health says 
the most common reason given in a niamey survey of women who did 
not use family planning was nobody told me 
opposition by husbands was cited by only 5 percent she said 
she added that she has seen women whove walked 10 miles to pick 
up birth control pills 
she said a survey taken a year ago showed 6 to 10 percent of the 
women were using some form of modern contraception which is a very 
high rate for the sahel the region just below the sahara 
in the west african nation of burkina faso for example a 
similar survey found 4 to 6 percent of women using modern birth 
control methods 
maidouka said radio and television broadcasts in the main 
national languages will be used to reach as many people as 
possible 
the us agency for international development has approved an 
11million fiveyear grant to support the project 
in a report the agency said nigers rapid population growth 
has accentuated the processes of deforestation and 
desertification 
it added wood harvesting which provides 80 percent of the 
nations energy far exceeds the sustainable capacity of the 
forests the forested area has decreased by 30 percent over the 
last 20 years due to pressure from farmers herders firewood 
cutters and drought 
only 12 percent of the country is arable and only 3 percent can 
be used for growing crops the annual per capita income is 240 
the us agencys report concedes that even if couples were 
limited immediately to two children per family the population would 
continue to grow for 40 years because almost half the current 
population are teenagers and the agency says it is likely to take 
30 years to reach the goal of only two children per family 
the familyplanning project however doesnt even talk of 
limiting families to two children 
it focuses on how planning and spacing of pregnancies will mean 
better health for mother and child 
there is much to do maidouka said tradition is a 
problem perhaps our children will have full rights now the man is 
the boss

editors note when the democrats gather in atlanta in midjuly 
to anoint michael dukakis therell be time for remembrance of 
political battles past not many will look back in fondness 
however to that other convention two decades ago when the party

the citys streets all under the eyes of national television

it was the last week of august 1968 it was the 
democratic national convention it was a mismatch of epic 
proportions and it was being televised live 
some five months earlier lyndon baines johnson had announced he 
would not seek nor accept his partys nomination the presidents 
plummeting popularity another casualty of the vietnam war 
four days later on april 4 martin luther king jr was shot to 
death in memphis igniting big city ghettos across america 
a month after that bobby kennedy was shot in the head while 
walking through a california hotel hours after winning that states 
primary he died the next day 
and in the heat of late summer pacifists anarchists and 
hedonists hippies yippies poets and mystics delegates 
dixiecrats and bureaucrats swelled the streets of chicago each day 
each with designs on the convention and all certain they could 
cure what ailed america 
each night those who had learned to live with the war bunkered 
in the luxurious hotels along michigan avenue where they might 
hear dixiecrat gov lester maddox of georgia espouse the dangers of 
letting misinformed socialists and powermad politicians take over 
the party 
those who opposed the war bivouacked in the citys lakefront 
parks where they could listen to yippie leader abbie hoffman 
promote the politics of confrontation beat generation poet allen 
ginsberg chant hindu hymns or folk singer phil ochs remind them 
its always the old who lead us to war its always the young who 
fall 
and before the week was out each camp would command center 
stage in the drama that reached into living rooms across the nation 
twenty years later there are still reminders of the democratic 
partys brief flirtation with anarchy the new york times commented 
in midjune this is a party that has been quite willing to 
destroy itself to thrash out the most divisive issues that the 
country faced among them civil rights and the war in vietnam 
and among consequences of 68 were farreaching reforms that in 
effect broke the power of oldline party bosses devised new ways 
in its nominating procedures and kept the white house in republican 
hands in three of four elections 
it was a tragic year for the democratic party and for 
responsible politics in a way recalls former minnesota sen 
eugene mccarthy a presidential aspirant and principal in the 
events of 1968 
there were already forces at work that might have torn the 
party apart anyway the growing womens movement the growing 
demands for greater racial equality an inability to incorporate 
all the demands of a new generation 
but in 1968 the party became a kind of unrelated bloc of 
factions each refusing accommodation with another each wanting

the hotels aging facade reflected the eerie glow of television 
lights as line after line of helmeted police officers followed 
teargas canisters into the crowd a skyblue scythe cutting a 
bloodred swath 
i remember finding a room high up in the hotel so i could 
watch thinking back recalled mike royko the pulitzer 
prizewinning columnist of the chicago tribune its hard to 
believe that spasm of well silliness turned out to be a pivotal 
point in american history 
thats not to minimize the goals of some of the people in the 
antiwar movement there were people in there with genuine social 
consciences and many were active in the civil rights movement 
but because people saw this on tv the fight for the 
democratic party came down to a confrontation between bullheaded 
cops and a bunch of nervous tired kids following leaders who 
talked about revolutionary theory and suddenly had everybody paying 
attention 
i remember the chant the whole world is watching well 
most of america was anyway and except for jimmy carter squeaking 
through they have put republicans in the white house ever since 
from a fiveroom suite on the hiltons 25th floor then vice 
president hubert humphrey watched the scene below his fate already 
in the hands of men whose job was to keep the chaos in the streets 
from reaching the convention site four miles to the south 
humphrey had not won a single one of the 15 party primaries had 
not even entered the campaign until two days after lbj said he was 
getting out 
yet everyone who came to chicago that week the supporters of 
the dovish mccarthy the backers of earnest south dakota sen 
george mcgovern the idealists who hadnt recovered from robert 
kennedys assassination knew humphrey likely would emerge the 
candidate 
in 1968 delegates ran on primary ballots without a stated 
preference and the political professionals the governor the 
mayor the state party chairman exercised an inordinate amount of 
influence on how the entire delegation voted 
that enabled humphrey to court the local heavyweights and come 
away with all the delegates in states such as pennsylvania which 
had given 90 percent of its vote to mccarthy in the beauty 
contest 
it was as crude a display of power as had been seen in many 
years punctuated by the televised sequence of daley drawing a 
finger across his broad neck in a signal to the podium to cut the 
microphones as connecticut sen abraham ribicoff gave his 
nominating speech for mcgovern and spoke of gestapo tactics in 
the streets of chicago 
soon afterward those same party professionals delivered 
humphreys firstballot nomination with the same sanguine 
efficiency police displayed in their 20minute downtown sweep of 
protesters 
i recall seeing antiwar protest leader david dellinger 
standing along the curb right in front of the blackstone hotel 
said deputy chief of patrol carl dobrich who served in the chicago 
police task force that night 
he was standing there like a whipped puppy he was in this 
incredibly rumpled suit and was holding a longstemmed flower a 
daisy or something the stem had been broken in the middle and he 
looked pathetic an hour or so before hed been a leader a 
guru or whatever and he was going to lead everybody to a new 
world 
now concluded dobrich who was subsequently tried and 
acquitted of federal perjury charges stemming from the disturbance 
he didnt have anyone around him 
by the end of the week 691 demonstrators had been arrested 200 
protesters were treated for injuries and an estimated 200 others 
never sought treatment for their wounds the police also paid a 
price with 161 injuries 
dellinger would spend a good part of the next few years in 
chicago as one of eight defendants charged with inciting violence 
at the 1968 convention 
the chicago seven trial black panther leader bobby seales 
case was quickly severed from the rest opened in september 1969 
and quickly became one of the most notorious in recent history 
the defendants and their attorneys were cited for contempt of 
court nearly 200 times they became a cause celebre their 
convictions overturned in 1972 by the 7th us circuit court of 
appeals their paths since as divergent as the motives that brought 
them together 20 years ago 
i have no regrets about the 60s whatsoever abbie hoffman 
who works as a political organizer said recently 
the only regrets i have is that we didnt do it deeper make 
it last longer

deputy chief of patrol carl dobrich of the chicago police who 
served in the conventions disturbance task force 
it was anarchy in the making there were some good people 
some sincere people out there in the parks and streets but there 
were many others who were without any leadership and who were just 
looking for trouble 
on wednesday midway through the convention i heard officers 
being dispatched to the band shell area in grant park where the 
flag was being taken down and replaced with some kind of viet cong 
banner one thing kind of led to another when the officers moved 
in the demonstrators were gathering around protest leader david 
dellinger looking for instructions 
after that skirmish dellinger pulled out of the band shell 
area leading his flock as it were 
some of the crowd headed for the hilton 
when we went for the first two to haul them away they lashed 
out at the officers arresting them and kicked them i got kicked 
myself 
then everything started flying through the air as they 
started throwing things rocks shoes everything 
a tray full of dishes came flying out the window of one of the 
hotel rooms but i couldnt see from which floor 
later i recall seeing dellinger standing along the curb right 
in front of the blackstone hotel he was standing there like a 
whipped puppy he was in this incredibly rumpled suit and was 
holding a longstemmed flower a daisy or something the stem had 
been broken in the middle and he looked pathetic an hour or so

threetime california assemblyman tom hayden remembers seeing 
fellow protest leader rennie davis have his head split open by 
the police while he thought he was trying to calm down or defuse a 
potential confrontation at an assembly at the band shell 
then he was taken away to the hospital and police came to the 
hospital trying to arrest him 
hospital workers had to hide him and get his head bandaged and 
get him into a cab so he could go to an apartment and rest 
late at night when the demonstrators got from the band shell 
to the front of the hilton it seemed to be the high point or the 
low point of the weeklong confrontations when they sat down and 
the television lights came on and they chanted the whole world is 
watching 
i was right there i was in the group of people that was being 
maced and we backed up and a woman started screaming 
we fell back through the windows of the haymarket lounge and 
everyone fell into the hilton and the police came after us 
through the broken windows it was hard to breathe with the gas 
and the mace but in any event there was a lot of panic and then 
the crowd fell backward and everyone fell into the windows 
i guess i wouldnt want to go through those times again 
hayden davis and six others were charged with conspiracy to 
incite violence

mitch kuhn leafs through one of his bound 
collections of political buttons pauses at a page of peacesymbol 
pins and reaches 20 years into his memory for a blackandwhite 
image from august 1968 
i was a peace activist in milwaukee kuhn says i had 
worked for sen eugene mccarthy and when i saw on television the 
mccarthy folks being rousted out of their rooms at the hilton and 
beaten and bloodied that goes right to the bottom of your soul 
in hindsight looking back i wish id have been here 
here chicago 1968 when in the last week of august thousands 
of angry young antiwar protesters upstaged the democratic national 
convention and the nomination of hubert humphrey with violent 
nationally televised clashes with police in the parks and on the 
streets 
those who were there may remember the stinging tear gas the 
crackling megaphones or the sight of an enraged mayor richard j 
daley leaping to his feet on the convention floor at connecticut 
sen abraham ribicoffs denunciation of gestapo tactics in the 
streets of chicago 
but for those who were not there the artifacts remain and for 
reasons both economic and emotional prices for 68 convention 
collectibles have risen dramatically 
certain humphrey campaign buttons are worth 150 more than 10 
times their book value just 10 years ago copies of the seed 
chicagos leading underground newspaper of the day have doubled in 
price in less than five years and now sell for about 10 at 
rarebook stores 
as in any market scarcity increases value clean documented 
20yearold buttons bearing the onceubiquitous peace symbol go for 
2 but several buttons designed by cartoonist jules feiffer to 
help raise money to defend the chicago seven protest leaders 
charged with conspiracy to incite violence at the convention go 
from 5 to 1250 depending on their condition 
books of the era also are in demand says kenan heise who owns 
chicago historical bookworks in suburban evanston 
typical buyers are people in their late 30s and 40s who shared 
the rebellious spirit of the times and yearn for something more 
tangible than their memories says heise who recently added a 
shelf of outofprint books by the chicago seven 
trial by tom hayden published in 1970 at 195 sells for 
15 abbie hoffmans 1968 paperback revolution for the hell of 
it published at 195 goes for 1250 listed at 12 are jerry 
rubins we are everywhere written secretly in the cook 
county jail and smuggled out according to a cover blurb or do 
it read this book stoned 
there also are memorabilia collectors who just like the way the 
stuff looks 
one of the best things to come out of the 60s was the 
buttons says jim norton 51 of suburban oak park who collects 
antivietnam war pins 
at the spring meeting of the local chapter of the american 
political items collectors a 2000member national organization 
norton pointed out his favorites circa 1968 an antilyndon 
johnson button inscribed lsd not lbj a blackandwhite pin 
bearing a sketch of uncle sam with a pistol and a

the market for chicago 68 artifacts is broad enough to include 
everything from a comicbookstyle copy of poet allen ginsbergs

they were leftwing activists whose courtroom 
antics and commitment to political change reflected a generation of 
angry youths disillusioned by a nation in undeclared war thousands 
of miles away 
the defendants who won national attention in the chicago seven 
trial are middleaged and grayer now one the author of a barbecue 
cookbook another a professional partygiver many are fathers and 
husbands 
but most remain committed to a watereddown brand of the 
activism that made them household names 20 years ago 
a lot of people tell me im selling out because i wrote a 
cookbook says former black panther leader bobby seale 51 whose 
barbecuing with bobby was recently published 
i say why do you want to pigeonhole me seale says i 
still believe in revolving political and economic power back to the 
hands of the people 
seale and seven others were charged with conspiracy to incite 
violence in august 1968 at the democratic national convention in 
chicago 
the 4month theatrics featured wildhaired defendants whose 
antics included wearing judicial robes to court taking them off 
and stomping on them and a 74yearold judge who refused to allow 
seale his own attorney and ordered him bound and gagged in the 
courtroom when he protested 
i think it certainly was a microcosm of the times former 
defendant john froines says but it was also theater so it was 
an exaggerated statement of the times as well 
when abbie hoffman said that the judge came right out of 
central casting it was true instead of them picking a liberal 
judge who was very restrained they picked a very harsh prejudiced 
jurist who in a sense kind of reflected the kind of oppression that 
people were talking about as being the nature of america at the 
time 
the case opened in september 1969 and became known as the 
chicago seven trial when us district judge julius hoffman severed 
seale from the others convicted him of contempt of court and 
sentenced him to four years in prison 
five of the other seven defendants rennie davis david 
dellinger tom hayden abbie hoffman and jerry rubin also were 
charged with crossing state lines with intent to riot and were 
found guilty in february 1970 
froines and lee weiner were acquitted none of the defendants 
was convicted of the conspiracy charge 
the five convictions and seales contempt citation later were 
overturned by the 7th us circuit court of appeals citing errors 
by judge hoffman and criticizing his courtroom demeanor 
the seven defendants and their attorneys also were cited for 
contempt of court nearly 200 times but all but 15 of the citations 
were dismissed 
in a 1982 interview a year before his death at age 87 judge 
hoffman said the defendants had made a mockery of the nations 
highest trial court 
most have no regrets about their behavior during the trial 
i was standing up for the sixth amendment of the 
constitution seale says that every citizen has the right to 
have legal counsel of his choice 
i never disrupted the courtroom unless my name was mentioned 
but judge id say youre a racist facist dog you denied me my 
constitutional rights 
seale the father of three now works in minority recruitment at 
temple university in philadelphia where he is doing graduate work 
in political science and africanamerican studies 
he also works in a program aimed at getting students into 
community service and social action 
ive refined my perspective a lot says seale i stopped 
advocating overthrowing the government when the government stopped 
trying to overthrow our organization 
he plans to use proceeds from his cookbook to fund scholarships 
for minority college students 
former yippie leader abbie hoffman one of the brashest of the 
defendants during the trial remains one of the most politically 
involved 
im an american dissident says hoffman now 51 and the 
father of three

he has made a career out of political protests and has been 
arrested numerous times in recent years in demonstrations against 
south african apartheid environmental hazards and other causes 
i dont think my goals have changed since i was 4 and i fought 
schoolyard bullies says hoffman who rents a home in new hope 
pa 
fellow yippie jerry rubin now owns a new york company that 
produces parties for yuppies at manhattans poshest nightclubs 
twenty years ago rubin called his indictment the academy 
award of protest at age 50 with a wife and infant daughter he 
says my protest days are over 
but hes proud of his actions in the days of rebellion we 
shook up the country we fought authority illegitimate authority 
i woke up the country to immorality in authoritative places 
when i think about it i miss the sense of purpose i miss 
the sense of righteous anger but im much healthier than i was 
then 
codefendant lee weiner says i was political then im 
political now 
then weiner was a bearded 29yearold northwestern university 
research assistant and antiwar activist who read books in the 
courtroom during the trial 
now hes a 48yearold father of four and runs a directmail 
firm in washington for nonprofit organizations and political 
clients 
i still consider myself utterly committed to the pursuit of 
social justice in the political context says weiner who has 
taken part in recent protests for more aids research and soviet 
jews 
weiner says he and the other defendants werent a bunch of 
wild radicals but were dedicated to a belief that people can 
and should be able to live better together and to a ferocious 
refusal to accept injustice as simply a given part of our lives 
froines now a professor at uclas school of public health was 
a yale university graduate with a phd in chemistry who decided to 
spend the summer of 1968 in chicago with his inlaws before taking 
a faculty position in oregon 
froines had done community organizing work with tom hayden and 
rennie davis and decided to get involved in the demonstrations 
im not an activist now which isnt to say that i have turned 
away from activism says froines 48 who served in the carter 
administration as director of toxic substances at the federal 
occupational safety and health administration 
its just that its a different time and place i still 
believe in progressive ideas and try to work that out in a 
different context 
the father of two froines champions environmental health issues 
at ucla and has a 20yearold daughter who has taken part in campus 
activism 
davis is in his late 40s and lives in the denver area where he 
sold life insurance for a while and dabbled in hinduism 
dellinger 72 a lifelong peace activist lives in peacham vt 
and has been active in protests against us involvement in 
nicaragua 
hayden 48 is a threeterm california assemblyman who espouses 
liberal causes and has been married to actress jane fonda for 15 
years 
the 60s were a decade of great achievement balanced by agony 
and tragedy hayden says it was a time that was very uplifting 
and focusing and we havent had a decade like that since 
ive gone in a circle that began in the early 60s and went 
from idealism to a bitter hostility to everything the government 
was doing back to a renewed idealism 
im thankful that ive survived and that my sense of idealism 
remains and that i try to be like the person i was at the 
beginning of the 60s 
froines says he isnt nostalgic about the 60s but would hope 
that it would happen again 
society progresses by people getting angry and doing things 
it was a great period i feel really strongly that societies need 
that kind of tension in order to progress i think that it was a 
very very good time

that december night 3 years ago in the bahamas 
where darlena and bob risley had traveled in a last desperate 
journey in search of a miracle cure for her cancer she became so 
nauseous and dehydrated that the doctor had to be called 
at their apartment the doctor gave her one shot for the nausea 
and a second shot to kill the pain in her back and in her stomach 
that had swollen larger than during her pregnancy years ago 
a few hours later just before midnight on dec 5 1984 darlena 
reached up and put her arms out to her husband he held her at 
that moment darlena risley stopped breathing at age 41 
darlenas suffering haunted risley so much that he was prepared 
to help her die sooner had she asked him for a peaceful end to her 
life even though it would have been a crime he thought about that 
when he returned to california and about the many others who endure 
the pain of terminal illness 
six months after darlenas death the 54yearold los angeles 
attorney started a campaign to revise the california natural death 
act to legalize active euthanasia and allow physicians to give 
terminally ill patients lethal doses of drugs upon their request 
and under certain safeguards 
darlenas death inspired risley to found americans against human 
suffering the group fell more than 100000 signatures short of the 
number required by the may 8 deadline to get the issue on the 
california ballot for novembers election but it still managed to 
gather 250000 names 
the organization with another proeuthanasia group the los 
angelesbased national hemlock society is planning to try again in 
1990 not only in california but in oregon washington state and 
florida as well 
while support for active euthanasia is growing in some segments 
of the american population the opposition remains strong from 
leading experts on medical ethics lawmakers religious leaders 
doctors and lawyers 
as individuals and as a society we have the positive 
obligation to protect life said cardinal joseph bernardin 
leader of the roman catholic archdiocese of chicago in a recent 
speech we have the negative obligation not to destroy or injure 
human life directly especially the life of the innocent and the 
vulnerable 
four prominent physicians and experts on medical ethics spoke of 
perilous times for our profession in a commentary printed in 
the april 8 issue of the journal of the american medical 
association they cited efforts in court and legislatures to 
legalize killing by doctors if patients request it 
now is the time for the medical profession to rally in defense 
of its fundamental moral principles to repudiate any acts of 
intentional killing by physicians and their agents the 
commentary said we call on fellow physicians to say that we will 
not deliberately kill and we must say to the broader community 
that if it insists on tolerating or legalizing active euthanasia 
it will have to find nonphysicians to do its killing 
the commentary was in response to an article published in the 
journal in which a doctor whose name was withheld described how 
he killed a 20yearold woman named debbie with an injection of 
morphine the woman like darlena was dying of ovarian cancer 
the commentary was signed by willard gaylin president of the 
hastings center in briarcliff manor ny leon r kass professor 
in the committee on social thought at the university of chicago 
mark siegler director of the center for clinical medical ethics at 
the university of chicago and edmund d pellegrino director of 
the kennedy institute of ethics at georgetown university 
in a telephone interview gaylin said he is not opposed to 
withdrawing medication or treatment from a dying patient if thats 
what he wants or to giving him pain relievers even if it would 
hasten death 
but i dont think doctors should assume the responsibility for 
actually killing a patient he said if our society wishes to 
condone that i think it would be best if that were not the 
doctors role we do allow the patient to do it to himself suicide 
is no longer a crime in any of the 50 states abetting a suicide is 
in almost every state 
gaylin suggested that if the public decides that some people 
should have the option of euthanasia then it should be done by a 
family member as surrogate for the physician 
this is precisely what ran through bob risleys mind in the 
final days of his wifes life she wanted to live so much that she 
withstood surgery four times and chemotherapy as the cancer spread 
through her body she suffered the indignity of having a catheter 
inserted into her stomach for eight months through which 
chemotherapeutic fluids flooded her abdomen the doctor had given 
her only a year to live she survived for two 
a few days before she died she and risley had discussed what 
they would do if her pain became too great but no decision was 
made except in his own mind

i had resolved that if she asked me to help her die i would 
have done that no matter what he says i knew at the time 
that would have been a crime in the bahamas as well as everywhere 
in the states 
but she never asked him i wasnt forced into that moral 
decision which many many other people have been forced into he 
says 
but even if the patient asks for a lethal dose of drugs it is 
still wrong to accede to the request according to the guidelines 
of the national conference of catholic bishops in washington 
it is still an act of homicide on the part of the agent still 
an attack on the dignity of human life says richard doerflinger 
director of the conferences office for prolife activities and 
that is something that no government thats established to protect 
life should be allowing 
referring to routine efforts to prevent suicides he says our 
society has a long tradition of respect for human freedom but we 
still send police officers to dissuade or grab people threatening 
to jump from a bridge out of respect for their lives 
essentially this situation is no different 
the church does approve doerflinger notes of withdrawing 
respirators and other lifesupport systems in some cases 
the church also teaches that its legitimate to withdraw 
extraordinary means of life support which are means that are 
considered excessively burdensome to the patient or which provide 
no benefit says doerflinger not every withdrawal of life 
sustaining treatment is seen as euthanasia 
doerflinger sees a growing support for euthanasia partly due to 
an aging population in the united states the average married 
couple has less than two children and the growing percentage of 
elderly people is being seen by others as more of a burden than 
they were in the past 
what opponents of legalized euthanasia fear is the potential for 
abuse and exploitation 
giles scofield staff counsel for concerned for dying a new 
yorkbased group concerned with care of the terminally ill says 
there is a danger of misreading a patients wants or needs and of 
doctors taking the easy way out 
were not convinced its necessary he says a lot of 
patients now have rights that arent being honored if patients 
knew that they could be taken off a respirator or refuse artificial 
nutrition without having to go to court in all likelihood they 
would not want physicianassisted suicide if doctors knew that 
an acceptable way of dealing with a terminally ill patient was to 
provide a lethal injection there might be a tendency to substitute 
that for compassionate care 
doerflinger says if active euthanasia were legalized it would 
go far beyond the limited population that would now be included in 
legislation proposed by americans against human suffering under 
which two doctors must agree that in their judgment the patient 
will die within six months 
i dont know of anyone who really thinks the killing of 
someone who is thought to have seven months to live could still be 
punished as firstdegree murder once youve established a policy 
that euthanasia for patients expected to die in six months is a 
public good doerflinger argues 
i dont see how society could continue to keep that arbitrary 
dividing line people who wanted euthanasia who expected to die in 
seven months eight months a year would claim that they are being 
denied their rights 
sissela bok the noted author and philosopher says legalized 
active euthanasia would be dangerous for any society 
i think it takes away a very powerful barrier that we have 
against one form of violence she says we need a barrier 
against different forms of violence but certainly violence against 
those who are unable to defend themselves it could be that some 
people would die in a process like this who would not want to die 
opponents also worry that legalized euthanasia would undermine 
trust in the doctors role as healer and lifesaver 
theres a difference between giving a patient a painkiller and 
giving a patient a patient killer says giles scofield 
people want to live as long as they can and want the benefit of 
the healing arts says bob risley but when things become hopeless 
so that there isnt anything else to do no more treatments then 
making people die through the natural dying process going through 
the agonies in the final few days seems rather fruitless

although its technically against the law 
physicians in the netherlands are tacitly allowed to practice 
active euthanasia putting an end to terminally ill patients lives 
with a lethal injection 
the practice there is believed to be more widespread than in any 
other country experts in the field say they know of no country 
where active euthanasia is legal 
but does the law wink at it yes it may in some cases says 
daniel callahan a noted author and expert on medical ethics who is 
the director of the hastings center a research institute in 
briarcliff manor ny 
dr pieter admiraal a dutch anesthesiologist at general 
hospital in delft and a supporter of euthanasia estimated in a 
telephone interview that there are about 5000 cases of euthanasia 
a year in a population of 15 million people only a handful of 
doctors have been prosecuted and officially only 140 cases were 
reported last year admiraal says 
most doctors fill in the form that it was a natural death 
he says admiraal says that in the last 10 years he has helped more 
than 100 patients to die he faced prosecution only once but the 
charges were dropped 
we are the first in the world to do this kind of experiment 
he says i think its done in a lot of countries always secret 
and illegal 
admiraal says doctors can be 95 percent sure the state wont 
bother them if they follow certain rules 
the patient must ask for euthanasia more than once he says 
the patient must be in a normal mental state and suffering 
unbearably it must be a disease which we cannot cure and the 
doctor has to have a second opinion 
we discuss the possibility of euthanasia for a week or so and 
we also have to believe it is the only way we have a whole team 
involved in the decision making we have to agree there is no other 
way to do it its not something to decide in an afternoon

editors note elliott abrams is a man not given to compromise 
or mincing his words that has made him a sizable band of political 
enemies especially in his handling of central american policy 
where the administrations efforts have not notably prospered 
undaunted the assistant secretary for interamerican affairs means 
to soldier on until the end of president reagans term 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
elliott abrams is ronald reagans point man in 
the one area where the presidents vaunted good luck seems to have 
deserted him 
on no issue have reagans policies come under more sustained 
assault than in central america abrams turf but abrams 
campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considers 
cubanstyle communism there havent gotten very far 
in the process he has become a lightning rod for policy 
opponents wrath and he has often found himself the target of 
corrosive taunts on capitol hill and in the bureaucracy as well 
abrams assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
looks with pride on the democratic gains made through much of the 
hemisphere but his efforts to dislodge two determined adversaries 
panamas gen manuel antonio noriega and nicaraguas sandinista 
government seem to have misfired 
the policies abrams has pursued are no less controversial than 
his style although hes only 40 few have seen more intellectual 
combat than he has 
few neutrals emerge when abrams is the subject of conversation 
a sampling of opinions hes arrogant hes brilliant hes 
untrustworthy hes courageous hes unscrupulous hes principled 
i dont like the man says former ambassador frank mcneil 
using a stronger noun 
i wish him a long life says rep henry hyde rill 
abrams has never been accused of obsequiousness in dealing with 
people who disagree with him 
this is a political battlefield he says the opposition 
fights with every weapon available and we need to fight equally 
hard 
off duty the abrams glower so familiar to opponents disappears 
as does the mantle of the noapologies crusader 
dawn finds him toasting frozen waffles for his three small 
children on weekends he makes french toast from scratch late at 
night he can be found curled up with a novel but during working 
hours its the combat zone 
the combat zone was livelier than usual during the irancontra 
hearings last year it developed that abrams had earlier misled 
congressional committees about fund solicitations for the contras 
and us involvement in an illfated resupply flight for the 
nicaraguan rebels 
from the democratic camp came predictable cries for abrams 
resignation he didnt oblige 
some blame him for the administrations more recent policy 
setbacks accusing him of flawed tactics and an abrasive style that 
alienates potential allies his supporters fault congress as balky 
and shortsighted irresolute friends in latin america hostile 
media bureaucratic infighting and the intractable nature of the 
problems he inherited 
abrams is a neoconservative he worked for two democratic 
senators daniel patrick moynihan of new york and the late henry 
jackson of washington state and in the 1980 campaign for the 
election of ronald reagan he is a native of new york city and a 
product of harvard 
abrams wife rachel is the daughter of norman podhoretz 
editor of commentary magazine and midge decter a champion of 
conservative causes 
after defecting to the republican party he joined the 
administration in 1981 becoming at age 33 the youngest person 
ever with the rank of assistant secretary of state he has had that 
title as head of three bureaus international organizations human 
rights and since 1985 latin america 
american aid to the antisandinista cause has been an article of 
faith with abrams when congress last february rejected further 
military shipments to the contras abrams thought it would 
undermine them in negotiations with their foes perhaps fatally 
the next blow came in may with the collapse of abrams 
negotiating efforts to induce noriegas departure it was 
especially painful since abrams had seen there a chance to further 
democracy in the hemisphere while ridding panama of a leader who 
was under indictment in the united states on drugdealing charges

according to abrams script american diplomatic and economic 
pressure coupled with discontent among the panamanian people 
would be enough to topple noriega it didnt happen panama is left 
with a wounded economy and noriega firmly in charge 
abrams misread noriega very badly says mcneil former 
ambassador to costa rica and one of his more persistent critics 
abrams approach regarded panamanians as little brown brothers 
to be pushed around with a little muscleflexing he says 
incredible ineptitude 
abrams backers contend his hand was weakened by a campaign of 
leaks from the justice department and the pentagon to undercut his 
grand design mcneils suggestion that noriegas abdication could 
best be achieved by a latin american led negotiating team is 
dismissed as balderdash by hyde one of abrams staunchest 
supporters 
abrams assumed his duties three years ago determined to try to 
overcome what he saw as a decline in american political will and 
leverage in central america like reagan he was convinced that the 
nicaraguan government left unchecked would spread its revolution 
and ultimately present national security dangers to the united 
states 
in pursuing his objectives abrams was never tonguetied in 
responding to his critics one congressmans suggestion that the 
administration was unconcerned over the murder of four american 
churchwomen in el salvador he called not only false but i would 
say malicious and bordering on the vicious 
he upbraided another blame america blame america never 
blame the communists 
talking with a reporter in his sixthfloor state department 
office abrams insists that he doesnt seek confrontation for its 
own sake 
but he says i have never understood that my function here 
was to take the presidents views and water them down sufficiently 
so that theyd be more popular in congress 
hed be delighted to solicit bipartisanship he says but the 
democratic party leadership had decided before i got here 
that this was impossible on central america 
its not just the democrats though hes critical of colleagues 
in the administration who he claims fail to toe the line in 
support of reagans policies but tend to accommodate the 
presidents ideological opponents because they have a personal 
agenda stretching beyond the presidents tenure lucrative jobs in 
private business after their government service ends 
i dont think that is why tens of thousands of people worked 
their fingers to the bone getting ronald reagan elected so that 
guys like me could come to washington and meet lots of people and 
get a good law firm job he says 
were supposed to pursue policies and if there are people in 
the press or in congress or in socalled human rights groups who 
dont like it too bad 
the people who dont like abrams almost succeeded in dislodging 
him from his office 
they had a good shot in june 87 abrams says they almost 
got me theyve only had one shot since then in april when 
everybody was blaming me for panama 
june 87 refers to his testimony before the committees 
investigating the irancontra affair in october 1986 abrams had 
denied us government involvement in a contra resupply flight that 
was shot down over nicaragua leading to the capture of an american 
soldier of fortune 
abrams said later he had not been informed that the flight was 
part of the contra aid network created by lt col oliver north 
the former national security council aide 
in june 1987 he testified before the congressional committees 
investigating the irancontra affair and called his misstatements 
completely honest and completely wrong 
in november 1986 abrams told the senate intelligence committee 
that the united states had not asked third countries for money for 
the contras in fact as the june hearings brought out abrams 
himself solicited a 10 million contribution from brunei a tiny 
oilrich sultanate in southeast asia 
he apologized to the committee explaining that he had promised 
brunei confidentiality and he admitted his handling of the matter 
had been foolish 
one democratic representative who is unmollified is george 
crockett of detroit who heads the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on interamerican affairs he wont allow abrams to 
testify without swearing him in first so we can at least go 
through the motions of trying to believe what hes testifying to 
wayne smith a former head of the us diplomatic mission to 
cuba calls abrams a man willing to lie and misrepresent the 
facts about anything 
robert kagan a former deputy to abrams puts such attacks down 
to political and ideological differences the liberal 
intelligentsia hates elliott abrams because he is the most 
articulate spokesman for administration policy he says he is 
a person of unique personal strength and strength of conviction 
nevertheless there are some people at the white house too who 
would like to see him replaced abrams believes but enjoying the 
full support of reagan and secretary of state george p shultz he 
says hell stay on board until the presidents term is up 
im not going anywhere he says

editors note smelling salts and artificial intelligence are 
just a couple of things researchers are willing to try in an 
attempt to stem blackouts among military pilots traveling faster 
than sound 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
while the nations military jet fighter 
pilots have been breaking the sound barrier and evading supersonic 
missiles a deadly invader has crept into the cockpit 
it strikes when they are at the top of their performance maybe 
in the middle of a dogfight pulling turns that would make the 
roughest roller coaster seem like a carriage ride in the park 
then they lose to gloc pronounced glock gravityinduced loss 
of consciousness 
it begins as a pilot starts to feel the crushing weight from a 
sharp turn or maybe a dive in a modern fighter such as the f16 
maneuvers can lead to forces of 9 gs nine times the force of 
gravity 
the blood becomes so heavy the heart cant pump it it drains 
from the brain things go gray the pilot may suffer tunnel vision 
then black 
its almost always fatal says maj rocky hill of the air 
force inspection and safety center at norton air force base calif 
he says there have been at least 13 gloc crashes since 1982 all 
but one fatal 
we got so smart on it so fast and started running people 
through the centrifuge for training and we said this is a real 
success story but it never really goes away hill said during a 
seminar on prevention at wrightpatterson air force base ohio 
it becomes worse with a new generation of planes the air 
forces advanced tactical fighter and the navys advanced tactical 
aircraft planned for the next decade with more mindnumbing 
capabilities 
pilots already are overloaded with computer screens switches 
gauges and dials and gloc is just one more worry 
the cockpit is becoming an increasingly hostile area to the 
pilot hill says 
robert e van patten leader of gloc research at the armstrong 
aerospace medical research laboratory at wright patterson says 
germans put meters in their ju88 dive bombers in world war ii to 
pull the plane out at low altitudes if the pilot lost consciousness 
all in all we arent that far ahead van patten says 
hill says gloc gained priority again about four years ago when 
video cameras were put in cockpits they captured pilots coming 
close to gloc 
susceptible pilots usually have many hours of flying time but 
relatively few hours in veryhigh performance aircraft they tend 
to be middleaged and have had little training on the centrifuge 
hill says 
these profiles very accurately describe our air force reserve 
and air national guard units that have converted to the f16 
hill says 
fatigue also is a big factor researchers say which could pose 
problems for a pilot flying multiple missions in wartime 
beginning in august the air force plans to train about 2500 
pilots per year fledglings and veterans on a new centrifuge at 
holloman air force base nm 
part of the training involves exercises that push the blood back 
up 
so does the gsuit a corsetlike garment inflated to keep blood 
from pooling in the legs soon to come is positivepressure 
breathing that forces air into the lungs and forces a pilot to 
exhale 
but even if a pilot does recover from gloc it can take up to 
two minutes to regain his bearings so scientists are looking at 
ways to tell the airplanes computer that the pilot is unconscious 
so the plane can briefly fly itself to safety 
mcdonnell aircraft co says it is near a system that keys on a 
pilots breathing and voice patterns combined with a computer 
memory of recent sharp maneuvers in the plane to tell when a pilot 
is at gloc risk 
van pattens group is trying more complicated sensors possibly 
in helmets that would measure head slump eye blink blood 
pressure pulse in head arteries and even the grip on the stick 
those researchers want to use more extensive artificial 
intelligence including neural networks computers based on the 
architecture of the brain to make more accurate judgments 
a pilot might someday put a computer disc with his own 
characteristics on board to tell the computer how to program the 
system exactly for him van patten says 
to revive a pilot researchers are studying ways to pulsate the 
gsuit administering small amounts of carbon dioxide which dilates 
blood vessels and raises blood pressure 
perhaps even plain old smelling salts says van 
pattenthey have a long and honorable history 
but most of all a recent study shows pilots want a system that 
they wont have to attach each time they get into a cockpit and 
that they can override if it starts to malfunction 
van patten estimates a simple prototype system could be built 
for 500000 and could be ready to fly by 1993 with another 3 
million but in the current budget climate he says money is hard 
to come by

tv audiences will soon get their first real 
chance to hear pianist vladimir feltsman who emigrated to america 
last summer after much publicized difficulties in getting out of 
russia on wednesday july 13 he will perform in a live from 
lincoln center telecast on pbs 
this will be my first purely musical tv event says the 
36yearold feltsman playing in the white house sept 27 and 
my debut at carnegie hall nov 11 were shown on the news a 
little i was on the 60 minutes show it was more talking than 
music 
the mostly mozart festival now in its 22nd year at avery fisher 
hall will open with feltsman on tuesday july 12 the program will 
be repeated on wednesday night and televised live 
mostly mozart is one of the leading music festivals in the 
world i am very pleased i have been invited says feltsman i 
will play mozarts piano concerto in b flat major the last by 
mozart he was composing it at the same time he was composing the 
magic flute it is an absolute masterpiece 
then frederica von stade will sing something and then we will 
do an aria by mozart together so i think it will be fun 
since arriving in america feltsman has played 60 performances 
this season has been very special for me he says because i 
am doing everything for the first time the first time in 
philadelphia israel new york chicago los angeles 
feltsman was considered one of the soviet unions best young 
pianists when he applied in april 1979 for an emigration visa 
that year he says 52000 soviet jews emigrated but his 
application was denied two hours after he applied moscow radio 
and tv stations were ordered not to play his records all his 
concerts were canceled for two years then for the next six years 
feltsman was allowed to give a few concerts one such in a factory 
where machinery all but drowned out his music 
on june 14 1982 feltsman supporters who knew him through 
recordings and european concerts scheduled his new york debut 
to publicize his plight misha dichter played that evening 
five years later feltsmans emigration was approved alice 
chandler president of the state university of new york in new 
paltz who had looked up feltsman when she visited russia 
telephoned to offer him a job feltsman his wife anna and son 
daniel arrived in new york last august 
their 5yearold son is settled into nursery school and already 
finds it easier to speak english than russian as for his and his 
wifes adjustment feltsman says we came here more or less well 
prepared we were not looking for some miracles we understand that 
it is a beautiful country with many problems which we all know 
paradise does not exist in the world as we also know for 
people of my occupation my mentality my psychology my ability 
im certain it is still the best place in the world 
feltsmans debut with symphony orchestra was in february with 
zubin mehta and the new york philharmonic from then till this 
fall im playing 10 different concertos and three different recital 
programs its a little bit tough 
in may feltsman played a piano sonata by alfred schnittke the 
soviet composer and his wife were allowed to travel to new york for 
the occasion this single fact assured me about glasnost much 
more than speeches made by soviet officials he says a few 
years ago such a visit of a leading soviet composer and playing by 
a jewish immigrant was unimaginable now it is real i hope such a 
normal attitude will go forward 
in addition to his concerts feltsman is cutting records and 
talking about a special school for budding american pianists he 
has made two recordings already and soon will make two more 
i think recording is one of the most important parts of the 
life of a musician he says the performing artist plays and 
it is disappearing in air now im already thinking not about 
success but about leaving some legacy 
part of that legacy too could be a special program for 
promising young american pianists of those hes worked with he 
says their main trouble even for the best i heard is their 
training at a very early age if you miss something at 6 7 8 or 
9 technically physically psychologically you will never get it 
back later 
feltsman has talked with some wealthy people about endowing a 
school free but available only to the most gifted 
with such things as music if you want to get good results you 
have to be very tough at the beginning he says and the 
principle has to be talent not ability to pay you cannot buy a 
musical gift with money 
asked whether hell be nervous about the mostly mozart opening 
and televised concert feltsman says i am very nervous always 
probably thats the way you have to pay for the joy to play 
the music

at dinner two years ago a friend told david 
henry hwang a bizarre tale that had made headlines in europe but 
received little attention in the united states 
a french diplomat falls in love with a chinese actress in 
beijing they carry on an affair for 20 years he later is arrested 
in france on espionage charges at the trial it is revealed that 
the actress is a man who was coerced into the liaison by the 
chinese government the diplomat claims he didnt know she was a he 
the story had a kind of resonance that appealed to me hwang 
says of what turned into m butterfly winner of the 1988 tony 
award as best play of the season so i initially thought of doing 
it as a musical 
hwang approached producer stuart ostrow who once had brought 
hwang composer philip glass and designer eiko ishioka together for 
a musical project that didnt pan out 
hwang thought about the story for two months and decided to 
dovetail the spy drama with the plot of puccinis madama 
butterfly he sent a twopage outline to ostrow it contained the 
axis of the plot particularly the idea of the french man thinking 
of himself as pinkerton and the actress as butterfly 
the outline became a play written in about six weeks rather 
than a musical because hwang didnt want to go through the lengthy 
process of finding a composer and lyricist 
i did no research on the story itself because the fact that 
the incident existed was enough for me he says i wanted to 
interpret it in my own way instead i did a lot of research on the 
period what type of secrets could have been passed in the early 
60s the origins of the vietnam war and what was going on in 
china 
before the end of 1986 ostrow optioned the play for production 
john dexter director of equus came aboard in 1987 and a year 
was spent casting and raising the 12 million needed to bring the 
play to new york when it opened in march 1988 at the eugene 
oneill theater john lithgow was starred as the hapless diplomat 
and bd wong played the exotic chinese opera singer 
broadway always was the goal hwang says i thought this 
was a play that had some commercial potential but it had never 
occurred to me growing up and working in the nonprofit theater 
that you could initiate a production on broadway 
m butterfly is the first broadway play for the 30yearold 
hwang even though he has had extensive credits offbroadway he 
made his mark there in the early 1980s with plays about 
chineseamericans such as fob the dance and the railroad 
and family devotions 
hwang was raised as a musician not a writer his first theater 
experiences were playing violin in the pit orchestra for amateur 
musicals but at age 12 he wrote a detailed family history 
divided into three generations 
my mothers family were wealthy chinese merchants who went to 
the philippines in the 19th century hwang says my fathers 
family came from shanghai where my paternal grandfather was a 
businessman 
hwangs parents arrived in the united states to go to school 
his father to study business at the university of southern 
california his mother to study piano they met at a foreign 
students dance at usc 
hwang was born in los angeles and grew up in a comfortable 
california suburb he has two younger sisters one a cellist and 
the other an elementary school teacher 
hwangs father wanted him to study business in college but he 
ended up at stanford which didnt have an undergraduate business 
program so he majored in english literature 
i started writing plays in college hwang saysi liked the 
idea of creating a world which then would exist in front of you 
in 1978 he studied writing with sam shepard and maria irene 
fornes at the fledgling padua hills playwrights festival in 
claremont calif 
it was a real mind opener for me hwang says they helped 
me get in touch with my subconscious in terms of using the 
subconscious to influence your work and give your characters life 
out of the festival came fob the story of a young chinese 
man fresh off the boat coming to united states to live with 
his chineseamerican relatives the play was first performed at his 
stanford dormitory and during his senior year it was accepted by 
the national playwrights conference in connecticut from there in 
the summer of 1979 fob was picked up by the new york 
shakespeare festival for production in new york in 1980 
after that i kind of had a career hwang says ive 
always been able to make a living as a writer its been a 
combination of the play writing some film and television writing 
and grants 
now hes cautiously enjoying his fame as a tony awardwinning 
playwright 
i had a vaccination against this at a younger age hwang 
says when i was in my early 20s i had a certain amount of work 
done not at this level but i got a certain amount of attention 
and dealt with these things at a smaller level i like to think 
that im more prepared 
since the opening of m butterfly hwang has turned his 
attention to a new musictheater monologue he is creating with 
glass and designer jerome sirlin its called 1000 airplanes on 
the roof and concerns the unlikely subject of ufo abductions the 
piece starring actor rocco sisto premieres in vienna this month 
and comes to the united states in september 
hwang who lives in los angeles with his wife ophelia would 
like to get back to writing his next play one already has been 
commissioned by the south coast repertory of costa mesa calif 
which received a tony this year as outstanding regional theater 
when im working on a play the play determines the hours 
he says i can write continuously consequently i can finish my 
plays fairly quickly usually between three and six weeks 
hwang feels he gradually has been able to get attention as a 
playwright not a chineseamerican playwright 
i feel less like a spokesman for asianamerican playwrights 
than i did the last time around says hwang referring to the 
days when fob and the dance and the railroad first 
attracted attention those early plays were specifically 
chineseamerican 
today i am less inclined to accept the role of spokesman for 
the asianamerican community once i felt dutybound to fulfill 
it now i feel its not really possible for me to be any kind of 
spokesman for any view other than my own

the view from the congested highways of the 
pearl river delta reveals the stuff of which dreams are made 
elsewhere in china 
spacious multilevel homes of the newly rich dot delta towns 
scores of new factories are under construction 
power lines crisscross the countryside as authorities try 
desperately to supply the areas growing economy 
the fertile delta an area slightly larger than maryland and 
centered around this port in guangdong province 90 miles upriver 
from hong kong is fast outpacing other regions in the drive to 
transform china from a backward to a developed nation by the turn 
of the century 
while communist party leaders hope the rest of the country will 
eventually catch up peasants from chinas vast interior are not 
waiting and have flooded the delta looking for work 
part of the areas success can be traced to its historic role as 
chinas window to the world canton was the center of trade between 
imperial china and the west while generations of guangdong men 
traveled overseas to seek their fortune through gritty hard work 
so when government leaders in beijing decided nearly a decade 
ago to open chinas doors to the outside world and to encourage 
private enterprise the adventurous cantonese responded 
enthusiastically 
after the cultural revolution this area was the earliest to 
open up said deputy mayor lei yu of canton referring to the 
196676 ultraleftist campaign that left the national economy in a 
shambles 
foreign things are accepted more readily he said in an 
interview the people here can easily absorb and digest things 
from the outside world which are suitable for us 
many of the 20 million overseas chinese with ties to guangdong 
province donated money for schools roads and hospitals they also 
built houses for relatives and set up jointventure businesses in 
ancestral villages 
in jiangmen a city about 40 miles south of canton which is the 
ancestral home of many chinese in san francisco overseas donations 
have reached about 128 million since 1979 
these people although they dont believe in communism love 
their hometowns said ding lisong deputy secretary general of 
guangdong a province of 55 million people 
perhaps the biggest boost to the delta has come from hong kong 
situated at the mouth of the pearl river most of the british 
colonys 57 million people are ethnic chinese with family links to 
the province 
hong kong businessmen facing a labor shortage as the colonys 
export industries prosper have turned the delta into a backyard 
workshop where thousands of factories do simple lowtechnology 
assembly work on toys textiles and other products 
the labor is cheap and we can handle the products in time 
explained lin taozhu director of the cha shan clothes and toys 
mill in dongguan city private motorcycles weave along provincial 
roads while color televisions sets and refrigerators have long 
lost their novelty expensive consumer items such as compact disc 
players and silk french shirts are available for the more affluent 
in canton shops and street markets 
a report carried by hong kongs china news service last year 
said conspicuous consumption by guangdong farmers had become a 
serious problem because funds that should have been used for 
production investment were spent on consumer goods 
the deltas businessmen say theres nothing wrong with 
accumulating wealth and dismiss suggestions their activity is at 
odds with chinese communism 
zhang chengjian whose tiled home in nanhai county is topped by 
a 13footdiameter antenna that gets television signals from hong 
kong and much of southern china claims he made 120000 yuan 
32250 in 1987 from the electronics business he started eight 
years ago 
now ive got so much money even if i dont work i can 
survive but since i have talent in this field i have to make a 
contribution to society he said 
he added that if a new television antenna he is developing is 
popular in the market then i will be very happy and the people 
will be happy to buy the product 
peasants from the chinese interior are migrating to the region 
by the hundreds of thousands in search of a piece of the economic 
pie but provincial official ding says they are helping alleviate 
an acute shortage of labor 
an estimated 320000 people from every chinese province except 
tibet had flocked to dongguan through april according to city 
officials 
at the cha shan clothes and toys mill about threefifths of the 
workers came from outside the area the factory floor is filled 
with young women who left rural china to make money for families 
back home 
theres not that much work in the countryside 21yearold 
long dingxiang of neighboring hunan province said as she worked a 
sewing machine making ears for toy bunnies she said at least half 
her earnings which fluctuate from around 100 yuan 27 to about 
400 yuan 108 monthly go back to her sevenmember family 
chen zhaoxiang 22 has worked at the adjacent cha shan kam 
shing toys factory for three years she makes at least 210 yuan 
57 a month doing quality control more than twice what she made 
as a primary schoolteacher in deqing county more than 125 miles to 
the east 
while standing over a box of usbound stuffed singing grapes 
miss chen said she not only sends money to her younger siblings 
back home but has 400 yuan 107 in a bank account a sum that is 
much more than usual to have in the bank in china 
typically the workers come to the delta on oneyear contracts 
and are paid piecework wages living in simple dormitories provided 
by their employers many young women return home after a few years 
of work to get married perhaps taking with them money for a dowry 
officials said 
the mass migration to the delta has created social problems 
several local officials say as some people arriving from other 
provinces contribute to prostitution and other crime 
although grumbling about the inequalities created by the 
governments economic reforms can be heard elsewhere in china 
delta officials believe there is no turning back and are drafting 
bigger plans for the future 
jiangmen official du said overseas chinese who want to invest in 
their home towns now are urged to help set up jointventure 
businesses instead of donating money 
in dongguan officials want to move into higher technology 
industries such as manufacturing computer parts electronic 
products and highquality cloth 
and the deltas people they just want to make more money

while china sleeps canton swings 
it is the nations neonlit nightlife capital where people dine 
and dance into the wee hours 
cantonese are known for going all out to make money and going 
all out to enjoy it explained 24yearold singer yuan jun 
originally from the northern city of harbin some 1800 miles away 
in the rest of china most people are asleep by 10 pm 
said yuan exaggerating just a bit in canton in the middle of 
the night there are still plenty of places to go he added 
exaggerating not at all 
per capita disposable income in canton the steamy pearl river 
port capital of southeastern guangdong province was 1416 yuan 
381 last year or 175 percent above the national average 
many canton residents use their pocket money to go dancing at 
one of the citys ballrooms which number 135 by government count 
on a recent saturday night the nanfang dance hall was packed 
with customers paying 10 yuan 269 each to swing to cantonese 
hits three separate seatings of 250 people each were scheduled for 
the evening with the closing set for 345 am 
the citys electronic game rooms also were busy most of the 11 
machines by the yonghan theater were in use at 30 fen 8 cents a 
game typically bringing in 200 yuan 54 on a busy day 
streets near the popular district along the pearl river were 
full of people well past midnight with many strollers stopping to 
drink tea or snack at the sidewalk restaurants that stay open as 
late as 3 am 
even cruising has come to canton a city of about 3 million 
people two men pulled a sedan up to a pair of young women walking 
outside the nanfang and beckoned them inside the women hesitated 
but finally climbed in 
prostitution and gambling which communist authorities in 
beijing spent years trying to stamp out also have returned to the 
canton region guangdong province recorded 5600 cases of venereal 
disease last year up three times from 1986 
canton seems more in step with the capitalist british colony of 
hong kong about 90 miles to the southeast than with beijing the 
national capital where most restaurants close by 8 pm and people 
spend their summer evenings playing chess and cards under street 
lights 
does cantons lust for fun and games mean communist morals are 
on the decline at least one top city official scoffs at the notion 
that dancing and communism are incompatible 
deputy mayor lei yu says cantons people work hard during the 
day and are entitled to relax at nights 
invoking the names of the two men primarily responsible for 
bringing communism to china lei ends the argument mao tsetung 
danced and so did red army leader zhu de

the city the democrats have picked for the 
nomination of the 41st president they hope is known to 
outsiders as the home of gone with the wind one very busy 
airport and three historically rotten sports teams 
to those who live here atlanta is a city thats easy on the 
eyes and fairly low on stress once even winning rand mcnallys 
most liveable designation a city with no hurricanes and very 
little snow a city that has always taken a great deal of pride in 
itself despite the problems that plague many counterparts crime 
poverty and the rest 
metro atlanta with no mountains or oceans to stop it spreads 
in every direction across 18 counties where about 25 million 
people live 41 percent of georgias population with around 
425000 in the city itself most atlantans actually live in the 
suburbs the average house costs 100000 and the average salary 
is a shade over 19000 
not much is left of atlanta from the civil war days indeed 
its burning at the hands of union forces made a spectacular scene 
in gwtw as the locals are wont to abbreviate the movie 
yes hartsfield atlanta international airport is entrenched in 
an ongoing battle with chicagos ohare for the nations 
busiest title but it is after all an airport and you do not 
often think about it 
the worlds most accurate perception of life in atlanta may be 
of its sporting life the braves the falcons and the hawks really 
have been through their history pretty rotten in atlantas 23 
years as a big league city through 75 seasons including 
eight by the flames hockey team which up and left citizens have 
yet to be inconvenienced by the rigors of lining up for tickets to 
a championship game 
a longdead soccer team the atlanta chiefs did play for a 
championship once and won but you didnt exactly have to camp 
out to get in 
to get around atlantans get in the car the city enjoys an 
extensive bus system and a clean fast train operation but trains 
serve only four lines which end at commuter lots in the suburbs 
and the system covers only two counties 
two other heavily populated suburban counties cobb and 
gwinnett have rejected joining marta the metropolitan atlanta 
rapid transit authority the most often stated reasons are fear of 
crime and taxes although it is widely understood that more than a 
few in atlantas white suburbs fear the train will bring blacks 
into their neighborhoods 
thats a painful admission for a city that thenmayor william b 
hartsfield during the civil rights movement of the late 1950s 
called the city too busy to hate 
but atlanta struggles still with racism 
the city itself is 66 percent black the 18county metro area is 
74 percent white while the metro areas costofliving ranks 
eighth best among the nations large urban areas the city itself 
is the secondpoorest in the nation with 28 percent of its people 
living in poverty 
although metro atlantas school systems and public places are 
integrated most individual schools and neighborhoods are not and 
in the housing projects of the inner city the drug trade and its 
attendant crime make regular headlines 
the citys elected leadership is predominantly black a point of 
pride for those surveying civil rights gains in the united states 
but it is not untroubled two fulton county commissioners are 
facing jail terms for voteselling convictions including a 
reginald eaves who was public safety commissioner under atlantas 
first black mayor maynard jackson 
the city has sustained a major business boom for the past three 
decades the root of its too busy to hate boast 
ted turners oncehomey little tv station which once used a dog 
as a cohost of the news has grown into a global news and 
communications empire known as cable news network city fathers in 
the mid60s built a majorleague sports stadium before they had a 
team to put in it 
the same booster spirit was evidenced earlier this year when 
atlanta surprised even itself by winning designation as the us 
candidate to host the 1996 summer olympics 
atlantans like to say with a knowing smile that their city is 
a nice place to live but you wouldnt want to visit here 
however tourist attractions can be found 
metro atlanta has stone mountain a mammoth granite hill with a 
popular park surrounding it and the memorial arts center home of 
the high museum of art and the awardwinning atlanta symphony 
orchestra 
there is also the restored birthplace of martin luther king jr 
and the nearby king center the carter presidential center home of 
the former presidents museum library and policy forum and an 
increasing number of nightclubs bars and firstquality restaurants 
atlanta also has 100 waffle house restaurants which lead the 
world in serving tbone steaks grits and waffles and a 
mystifying number of mexican restaurants the varsity meanwhile 
bills itself as the worlds largest drivein restaurant 
atlanta has piedmont park a tranquil lawn surrounded by the 
commotion of the city in the manner of new yorks central park it 
has grant park which contains an ambitiously renovating zoo and 
the cyclorama the worlds largest painting depicting the civil 
wars battle of atlanta 
and atlanta after all does have national league baseball a 
national football league team and a representative of the national 
basketball association you can cheer a dale murphy home run or a 
dominique wilkins slam dunk 
tickets arent that hard to get

organizers of the democratic national convention 
are preparing for the worst assassination attempts larcenous 
ladies of the evening and massive demonstrations in hopes that 
all their work will be for naught 
we cant always predict we have to assume that someone will 
try to do something and we have to try to minimize that 
possibility we cant guarantee anything said dick murphy head 
of the dnc security advisory committee 
last month the atlantafulton county emergency management 
agency held drills on how to respond to 179 possible disasters 
ranging from riots to spills of nuclear materials during the 
convention 
in addition state county and local police have been taking 
special courses in antiterrorist tactics crowd control and arrest 
procedures 
and downtown hotels say they are increasing hotel security 
especially late at night to prevent room burglaries and keep out 
prostitutes 
even the rapid rail transit stop at the omni international the 
convention site will be closed to discourage wouldbe terrorists 
about 35000 people are expected for the july 1821 convention 
the total number isnt a city record for a convention but a major 
political event tends to attract thousands of demonstrators with a 
range of causes 
in response the city has taken over a 85000squarefoot 
parking lot across the street from the convention site and wants to 
limit demonstrations to that space allocating 90 minutes per group 
on a firstcome firstserve basis 
current plans call for demonstrations in the lot between 9 am 
and midnight each day the city will provide stage and sound 
equipment 
despite the arrangement atlanta police maj ww holley who is 
in charge of security for the area said the city has not ruled out 
the possibility of large parades and demonstrations similar to 
those at the 1984 convention in san francisco 
but he says we will not have a convention like they had in 
chicago referring to the riotscarred democratic gathering in 
1968 
murphy declined to give the number of federal state county and 
local security people assigned to convention duty but the atlanta 
journal and constitution reported that 1350 police officers would 
be involved 
gene guererro state director of the american civil liberties 
union said his group is recruiting about 100 volunteer lawyers to 
help people who are arrested 
we dont know who is going to come or how many we have been 
encouraging people to apply for applications to demonstrate he 
said 
murphy a veteran of democratic conventions said current 
controversies do not match the emotional levels of the vietnam war 
and the early stages of the civil rights movement 
in addition the relationship between the two contenders for the 
nomination michael dukakis and jesse jackson is basically 
cordial the best ive seen since 1952 murphy said

local leaders figure the democratic national 
convention will make a 60 million impact on atlantas economy and 
the democratic party hopes to cash in too 
in addition business owners are hoping to take advantage of the 
presence in town of so many political and corporate decisionmakers 
by doing a little lobbying on their own behalf 
the party itself is selling rights to use the convention logo on 
various souvenirs including a official licensed partyapproved 
donkey call 
one study done in conjunction with atlantas bid for the 
convention estimated that the overall economic impact will be 587 
million a second study placed the amount at 643 million it all 
depends on how many thousands of people actually show up 
less measurable is the amount of business that might be done as 
a result of contacts during convention week 
but barry king atlanta chamber of commerce vice president for 
communications says that every highroller in political circles 
will be here 
its an opportunity for atlanta to be seen and atlantans to be 
seen and for anybody to make a deal he said 
by offering decisionmakers a good time businesses hope to gain 
an edge when contract time comes around or by staging an event 
where customers can rub elbows with the famous and powerful 
businesses hope to benefit from kind memories later on 
on the more concrete side the studies estimate convention 
visitors including about 15000 members of the news media will 
spend 
between 96 million and 105 million on hotel rooms 
between 38 million and 43 million in hotel restaurants 
between 49 million and 52 million in other restaurants 
some 15 million in hospitality suites 
between 19 million and 22 million on entertainment 
between 3 million and 34 million in retail stores 
between 23 million and 25 million on local transportation 
between 11 million and 12 million on miscellaneous 
purchases 
all that adds up to a direct impact of 281 million using a 
study based on the 17200 hotel rooms reserved for the convention 
or 308 million based on 35000 visitors 
the atlanta convention and visitors bureau says each convention 
dollar spent in the city turns over 209 times in the local 
economy giving a total direct and indirect impact of 587 million 
or 643 million 
mark weiner sr who is in charge of policing use of the 
convention logo said therell be the usual assortment of buttons 
tshirts coffee mugs pens pencils and other paraphernalia 
available for folks who want to remember atlanta 
and theres the donkey call its on a string that you wear 
around your neck and emulates the sounds of a donkey weiner said

there are three main streets in atlanta but none 
is the main street 
that is peachtree street just plain peachtree street not 
peachtree circle peachtree court peachtree drive peachtree lane 
peachtree parkway peachtree place peachtree battle avenue 
peachtree battle circle peachtree corners circle peachtree park 
drive west peachtree street or any of the other almost 30 streets 
named in some way after peach trees 
just plain peachtree street the one without any peach trees 
just plain peachtree street the one with ptree street on 
the road signs because the full name wont fit 
to be exactly honest however its only just plain peachtree 
street for 43 miles then it becomes peachtree road for 77 miles 
then it transforms into peachtree industrial boulevard and fades 
away into four counties eight towns and one deer crossing miles 
away in the northeast georgia foothills 
and to be precise peachtree road and peachtree industrial 
boulevard run sidebyside sort of for 28 miles luckily its 
not at the same place where west peachtree street runs parallel to 
peachtree street for about about a mile 
confused welcome to atlanta 
a trip along peachtrees length touches almost all parts of 
atlanta life 
the streets southern tip rests underneath a rapid rail track a 
few blocks later youre at five points the foot of the downtown 
business district 
next comes office towers rising on either side of the treelined 
street as it curves its way to midtown the center of the citys 
arts life 
out a ways you reach buckhead long the citys most upscale 
area and then lenox a busy retail region 
after that the character begins to change from bustling to 
bristling 
there are apartment buildings condominiums car lots then the 
road narrows from six to four to two lanes and the traffic lights 
become sparser 
finally 441 miles from its beginning the road becomes plain 
old mceven road 
as it winds through the city and suburbs peachtree crosses 
other streets named for famous georgians martin luther king jr 
boulevard ralph mcgill boulevard jimmy carter boulevard 
it also crosses mitchell street named for the man who donated 
land for atlantas first railroad station not margaret mitchell 
author of gone with the wind she by the way was run over and 
killed in 1949 by a cab while trying to cross you guessed it 
peachtree street

atlantas taxi industry considered by some a 
blight on the citys polished image of southern hospitality is 
sending drivers to school to teach them how to be nice to all the 
visitors expected for the democratic national convention 
organizers are aware that a cab and its driver are often the 
first to greet visitors and they want at least 1000 of the citys 
approximately 1800 hacks to go to charm school by the time 
delegates reporters and party leaders begin arriving in midjuly 
the goal of the atlanta ambassadors program is first to 
sensitize the industry to the level of services that are expected 
and then secondly to try and change the publics perception of 
the industry said joseph hall a retired army colonel who for 
the past year has headed the citys taxicabs and vehicles for hire 
bureau 
leslie breland director of central atlanta marketing for the 
citys convention bureau admits atlanta taxi drivers have had a 
bad reputation in the past mainly because the drivers have been 
pretty much a hodgepodge of different companies without a sense of 
cohesion and purpose 
the ambassadors program is modeled on a similar effort in miami 
dubbed miami nice the threehour class now required for all 
cabbies who apply for or renew their licences teaches courtesy and 
professionalism atlanta history and rules and regulation of the 
industry 
one of the concepts the course teaches is for the drivers to 
think of their cabs as their office 
from the physical standpoint the taxicabs are looking better 
and cleaner ms breland said 
she believes the program is having an impact already a recent 
computer trade show brought about 60000 people to atlanta and she 
said the convention bureau has yet to receive a negative letter 
our comments from both the business community as well as the 
visitors are that the cabs look clean the drivers look clean and a 
friendly smile goes a long way 
from the drivers standpoint those friendly smiles turn into 
bigger tips for them she said

power geography and the luck of the draw will 
decide where democrats stay during their national convention this 
month 
vips financial gurus and party brass automatically get the best 
hotels while state delegates and journalists divvy up about 18000 
rooms in 106 other hotels dotting a fourcounty area 
even private dwellings are getting into the act under a 
hostahome program that will open up some of atlantas best 
addresses to democrats from across the country 
but as the convention draws near some lingering questions about 
lodging remain 
convention spokeswoman ruth berry said housing plans wont be 
finalized for another week a situation that gives hotel managers 
the fits but she said flatly that everybody will get a room 
only the georgia delegation which plays host to the convention 
got to choose its hotel outright chairman john henry anderson 
selected the omni international which is connected to both the 
omni arena and the georgia world congress center twin sites of the 
convention 
last october the democratic partys other state chairmen used 
an unusual lottery to decide where their delegations will stay and 
where they will sit during the nominating process courtesy of the 
atlanta braves baseball team 
the chairmen meeting in washington last october picked 
numbered baseballs out of a bin each signed by major league home 
run king henry aaron no 1 was chosen by louisiana and state 
chairman james j brady promptly selected the atlanta hilton 
the state getting first choice for lodging got the last choice 
for seating on the convention floor said ms berry 
maryland chose the final baseball and wound up in a holiday inn 
but its delegates will have frontrow seats when the democrats 
nominate their presidential candidate 
two other delegations from minnesota and south dakota were 
barred from the lottery because they violated party rules by 
failing to adhere to the national partys deadline for primary 
season events ms berry said they ended up at some of the more 
farflung motels a trafficclogged 45 minutes away from the 
convention site 
while lodging ranges from the posh hilton to chain hotels on 
neonlined strips in the atlanta suburbs the democratic partys 
powersthatbe will put their feet up in either the ritzcarlton or 
the westin peachtree plaza 
the party apparatus itself will operate out of the marriott 
marquis and the hyatt regency both downtown highrises that means 
democrats and their top financiers will take up the biggest part of 
four of the citys best hotels all of which were exempt from the 
statebystate lottery 
and under the hostahome campaign devised by jerry 
skelton some delegates and reporters will be staying with owners 
willing to open their doors 
roger and dee whitney who own a 350000 home in cobb county 
just northwest of atlanta said they joined the program not because 
of politics they are republicans but because they wanted to be 
a part of one of the biggest events in recent atlanta history 
this convention is putting atlanta in the spotlight and wed 
like to think we had a small part in all the excitement said 
mrs whitney

when southern corn leaf blight wiped out 
15 percent of the us corn crop in 1970 at a cost of more than 1 
billion plant breeders scrambled and within two years found 
varieties resistant to the disease 
ironically it was the breeders who had helped to start the 
disaster 
aiming for better varieties they had unknowingly bred 
susceptibility to the blight into fully 80 percent of the nations 
corn crop without that genetic uniformity the blight would have 
done little damage 
the same reliance on uniform crops led to the irish potato 
famine of the 1840s and to the spread of a wheat disease in 1916 
that led herbert hoover to call for two wheatless days each week 
the danger is that it could happen again 
according to peter day director of the center for agricultural 
molecular biology at rutgers university too little is being done 
to prevent such epidemics 
what were concerned about is having backup ability to deal 
with future threats day said during a recent us department of 
agriculture conference on biotic diversity and germplasm 
preservation global imperatives 
germplasm is the breeders term for the hereditary 
information in plants or animals when breeders encounter a crisis 
like the southern corn leaf blight they search for 
diseaseresistance genes in domesticated and wild varieties of the 
threatened crop 
the united states has no naturally occurring wild varieties of 
its major food crops tomatoes come from central and south america 
wheat and barley from the middle east and soybeans from asia 
virtually every major food crop is native to some other part of the 
world 
the us is a havenot nation in terms of germplasm 
resources said henry shands director of the national plant 
germplasm system operated by the usdas agricultural research 
service weve got to have a certain amount of gene bank defense 
to protect our nations food supply in the future 
without those breeding resources shands said the agriculture 
systems are going to collapse we just dont have enough land 
collecting germplasm in foreign countries is often a politically 
delicate task complicated by what is usually called the 
northsouth debate this refers to the unwillingness of some 
tropical and semitropical countries rich in germplasm the south 
to export their resources to the industrialized nations the north 
many of the tropical countries complain they are forced to pay 
industrial nations a hefty price for seeds produced from the 
tropical countries own resources 
some have done more than complain ethiopia has largely cut off 
access to its germplasm resources for example and many nations 
that could help each other such as north korea and south korea 
refuse to exchange germplasm with one another because of the tense 
political relations between them 
the united states maintains germplasm collections around the 
country with a central repository the national seed storage 
laboratory in fort collins colo 
but not enough is being done to evaluate and use those genetic 
resources researchers say and the programs cover only plants no 
organized program exists to collect and store the germplasm of 
important farm animals 
unfortunately financial support for germplasm collection and 
evaluation is lacking shands said the national plant germplasm 
system budget increased from almost 14 million in 1986 to 265 
million this year but despite usda appeals no increases were 
proposed for next year 
additional funds are needed to speed the incorporation of 
disease resistance into food crops which reduces the need for 
pesticides improving food safety and water quality shands said 
whales receive enormous attention while seeds go unnoticed 
said lawrence busch of the university of kentucky some 
absolutely minute and totally unattractive grass might be as 
important as that whale 
for example a tall wild wheat collected in eastern turkey in 
1948 was found to carry genes that made domestic wheat resistant to 
common and dwarf bunt and made it better able to tolerate stripe 
rust snow mold and mildew said sherl dietz coordinator of the 
agricultural research services western regional plant introduction 
station in pullman wash 
the transfer of diseaseresistance genes from wild strawberries 
to commercial varieties has helped increase strawberry yields by 
300 percent since 1960 said dietz similar advances have been made 
in other crops 
part of the urgency in conserving germplasm comes from the 
escalating destruction of forests and other natural habitats around 
the world 
up to 20000 species of plants and animals become extinct each 
year because of land clearing urban development and overgrazing 
said waldemar klassen director of the agricultural research center 
in beltsville 
the loss of unique plants and animals will deny future 
generations the use of still undiscovered genes for new foods 
fibers and medicines and industrial raw materials he said 
with its limited resources the agricultural research service 
does the best it can to collect germplasm before it is lost shands 
said a botanist will go to pakistan soon for example to retrace 
ancient trade routes in search of citrus fruits and other crops 
that may have been planted by the traders who followed marco polo 
to the orient 
its possible crops that have been lost in europe and the middle 
east might survive in those isolated regions farmers are rapidly 
clearing the land there and the opportunity to search for unusual 
crops wont last long he said 
storing germplasm is a tricky business although its tempting 
to think of plant gene banks as libraries from which breeders can 
pluck genetic information they need gene banks differ from 
libraries in one important respect the gene banks are alive 
plant germplasm is stored largely in the form of seeds they 
last a long time nobody is quite sure how long 50 or 100 years 
might be a good guess depending on the species but they dont 
last forever 
at the national small grain collection in beltsville david 
smith oversees 108000 specimens of grains including wheat barley 
oats rye rice and triticale a wheatrye hybrid 
seeds are stored in small manila envelopes with a maximum of 
500 grams of seed about a pound kept on hand for each sample the 
envelopes are stored in metal boxes stacked on tall 
industrialstyle steel shelves in a room where the temperature is 
kept at 50 degrees fahrenheit 
breeders requesting samples are sent about 5 grams enough to 
grow a row about five feet long smith said when stocks run low 
seeds are planted and grown to replenish the seed supply 
that also provides an opportunity to further identify the 
genetic traits contained in the seeds but the process has a cost 
some genes in the original batch appear again in the new 
generation some dont every time you regenerate seeds you lose 
a little diversity says shands 
information on us germplasm is kept in a database called the 
germplasm resources information network or grin which is 
available to any plant breeder 
such resources will be essential to feed a world that will 
support 6 billion people by the year 2000 the worlds farmers will 
have to produce more food in one generation than has been produced 
in the entire 10000year history of agriculture said garrison 
wilkes of the university of massachusetts and maintaining genetic 
diversity will be a global imperative 
there will be no synthetic food wilkes said you cant 
look for substitute technology

add inaccuracy to the multitude of sins critics 
are attributing to science texts these days 
critics of science texts have lately accused publishers of 
dumbing down their books of making them dull and of pandering 
to interest groups who oppose the teaching of evolution on 
religious grounds 
above all they charge science texts with their predictable 
experiments and boring vocabulary lists are at least partly to 
blame for turning a fascinating subject into one students want to 
avoid 
now it seems such texts may be guilty of botching elementary 
scientific facts according to bookwatch a firstofitskind 
noholdsbarred monthly newsletter devoted to reviewing junior high 
and high school science texts 
bookwatch was launched in february by william v mayer 
emeritus professor of biology of the university of colorado and 
william j bennetta a research associate and fellow of the 
california academy of science 
each issue offers three 1000word reviews by practicing 
scientists and science educators 
bennetta said he first became interested in science texts in 
1985 when california education authorities drew national attention 
by successfully demanding that publishers devote more space to 
evolution 
for the first time i looked into the kinds of textbooks being 
submitted and was severely disappinted by what i saw he said 
the newsletter published by the national center for science 
education in berkeley calif claims to be to science texts what 
consumer reports is to retail products a candid review free of 
influence from publishers its aimed at teachers and state 
officials responsible for selecting science texts 
the reviews in the four editions published so far identified an 
array of factual errors 
the teachers edition of life science 1987 a junior high 
biology text published by scott foresman and co states 
incorrectly that the word biology derives from latin roots 
meaning the study of life as reviewer michael t ghiselin pointed 
out the word is rooted in greek 
prenticehalls biology 1987 inaccurately tells 10th 
graders that electron microscopes were around in 1931 about 30 
years before they were in use according to reviewer colin o 
hermans professor of biology at sonoma state university 
lawrence w swan a biology professor at san francisco state 
university found that the teachers edition of dc heath and 
cos life science 1987 text for middleschool students was 
loaded with errors 
the text shows a picture of a lemur but wrongly calls it a 
monkey it presents a map incorrectly showing the range of the 
american opossum extending to northernmost alaska the map also 
shows both monotremes and marsupials in new zealand though new 
zealand has neither according to the review 
the authors of scott foresmans text biology 1988 guess 
that a fish has hipbones and a humantype pelvis and they 
depict the hazardous dumping of chemical wastes as something in 
the past write mayer and bennetta 
bennetta said he has not heard from publishers so far but has 
gotten numerous encouraging letters from education officials 
but kate nyquist vice president of science and health at scott 
foresman said that while she has a great deal of respect for 
the national center for science education bookwatch is one of 
their least productive enterprises 
im not saying we dont make any mistakes and were always 
grateful to have them pointed out but to say as the newsletter did 
that this book is scientifically meaningless is rather global 
and not correct 
she said her company takes the newsletter very seriously but 
it criticizes from a very narrow perspective it can hurt my 
business but i dont think our customers recognize it as a 
constructive evaluation tool 
calls to prenticehall and dc heath were not returned

mountain climbers may suffer impaired 
judgment because they dont sleep well according to a study of six 
people who simulated climbing mount everest by living 40 days in a 
lowpressure chamber 
people have known for a long time that sleep at high altitudes 
is poor we found sleep at high altitudes is so poor that little 
restorative effect can be expected dr james d anholm said in a 
summary of his study 
these new results call into question the longheld belief that 
the dangers of highaltitude climbing are due primarily to the 
dangers of terrain weather and the lack of oxygen anholm said 
oxygen lack at night instead of during the days exertions 
probably is responsible for the severe sleep loss said anholm an 
assistant professor of medicine at loma linda university medical 
center in california 
climbers who carry oxygen at high altitudes would probably 
benefit more from using it while they sleep than while they are 
awake he said 
jim whittaker who in 1963 became the first american to reach 
the summit of everest the worlds tallest mountain at more than 
29000 feet was skeptical of the study but said it may have merit 
it could be lack of sleep causes people to make mistakes at 
high altitudes but i think its more the lack of oxygen during 
exertion he said by telephone from port townsend wash i feel 
thats a bigger cause you dont sleep a lot but you sleep 
enough 
phil ershler who in 1984 became the first american to climb 
everests north face said he sleeps well on mountains but i 
dont think theres any question that theres some validity to 
anholms conclusions 
how well a climber sleeps and performs at high altitude is 
very much an individual thing ershler said by phone from 
bellevue wash 
anholm an internist presented his study in may at the 
federation of american societies for experimental biology annual 
meeting here 
the six people in anholms study were among eight paid 
volunteers who lived for 40 days in a large lowpressure chamber in 
natick mass as part of a larger armyfunded study of the effects 
of high altitude 
pressures in the chamber were regularly reduced to simulate a 
climb of everest with stops at sea level 15000 feet 20000 feet 
and 26410 feet about the level of the south col camp 
anholm measured oxygen in the volunteers blood and monitored 
their sleep by measuring brain waves 
he found blood oxygen levels were lowest at high altitude and 
during sleep and that as altitude increased the volunteers slept 
much less awakened more often felt more irritable in the morning 
and had far more frequent episodes of sleep apnea intervals during 
which breathing ceased for about 10 seconds 
even at the simulated 15000foot level the volunteers rarely 
slept more than 10 minutes before awakening most significantly 
the number of arousals two or threesecond awakenings that 
werent remembered as opposed to full awakenings that last more 
than 10 seconds rose from 20 per hour at sea level to 117 per 
hour at 26410 feet 
for sleep to have a restorative effect it needs to be 
relatively undisturbed anholm said these very brief arousals 
disturb sleep enough that you perform as though you are partially 
sleep deprived

when southern corn leaf blight wiped out 
15 percent of the us corn crop in 1970 at a cost of more than 1 
billion plant breeders scrambled to find varieties resistant to 
the disease 
ironically it was the breeders who by 1972 had helped to stop 
the crisis who had helped to start it 
aiming for better varieties they had unknowingly bred 
susceptibility to the blight into fully 80 percent of the nations 
corn crop without that genetic uniformity the blight would have 
done little damage 
the danger is that it could happen again 
according to peter day director of the center for agricultural 
molecular biology at rutgers university too little is being done 
to prevent such epidemics 
what were concerned about is having backup ability to deal 
with future threats day said during a recent us department of 
agriculture conference on biotic diversity and germplasm 
preservation global imperatives 
germplasm is the breeders term for the hereditary 
information in plants or animals when breeders encounter a crisis 
like the southern corn leaf blight they search for 
diseaseresistance genes in domesticated and wild varieties of the 
threatened crop 
the united states has no naturally occurring wild varieties of 
its major food crops tomatoes come from central and south america 
wheat and barley from the middle east and soybeans from asia 
virtually every major food crop is native to some other part of the 
world 
as a result said henry shands director of the national plant 
germplasm system operated by the usdas agricultural research 
service weve got to have a certain amount of gene bank defense 
to protect our nations food supply in the future 
collecting germplasm in foreign countries is often a politically 
delicate task complicated by what is usually called the 
northsouth debate this refers to the unwillingness of some 
tropical and semitropical countries rich in germplasm the south 
to export their resources to the industrialized nations the north 
many of the less developed countries complain they are forced to 
pay industrial nations for seeds produced from the less developed 
countries own resources 
the united states maintains germplasm collections around the 
country with a central repository the national seed storage 
laboratory in fort collins colo 
but not enough is being done to evaluate and use those genetic 
resources researchers say and financial support is lacking 
shands said 
the national plant germplasm system budget increased from almost 
14 million in 1986 to 265 million this year but despite usda 
appeals no increases were proposed for next year 
germplasm banks will be essential to feed a world that will 
support 6 billion people by the year 2000 the worlds farmers will 
have to produce more food in one generation than has been produced 
in the entire 10000year history of agriculture said garrison

early signs of breast cancer may be harder to 
detect in women who have breasts enlarged with siliconegel 
implants a study suggests 
the california study included 753 breast cancer patients treated 
during a 66month period 20 of whom had received the implants 
mammography an xray method used to detect breast cancer had 
failed to detect the cancer in all 20 said the study by dr melvin 
j silverstein of the breast center and valley hospital medical 
center in los angeles van nuys district 
silverstein and his colleagues said that when cancer finally was 
detected in the women with implants it was more likely to be at an 
advanced stage and to have spread to lymph nodes resulting in 
worsened prognosis 
the study was printed in the june issue of archives of surgery 
a journal published by the american medical association 
doctors consider early detection of breast cancer by 
selfexamination and mammography essential because women are more 
likely to survive and avoid disfiguring surgery if the tumors are 
found at an early stage 
more than 1 million american women have received implants to 
enlarge their breasts silverstein said doctors should tell women 
considering such implants that the cosmetic surgery may delay 
diagnosis of breast cancer 
dr lasalle d leffall jr a washington physician agreed in an 
accompanying editorial but said proper placement of silicone 
implants may reduce the extent to which the implants cloud details 
of a mammogram

parents should not leave babies face down on water 
beds because they may not be able to raise their heads enough to 
breathe 
we believe that a general warning should be issued and that 
infants should not be placed unattended or left to sleep on water 
beds wrote dr ramesh ramanathan and colleagues from the 
university of wisconsin 
they raised their concern in a recent letter in the new england 
journal of medicine after reviewing 34 cases of sudden infant death 
in wisconsin six of the babies were found dead on water beds 
we believe that an infant placed on a water bed with quilts or 
restrictive clothing one of our patients was clad in a snowsuit 
forms a depression or sink in the water bed in which the head and 
face lie they wrote it is very likely that the infant is 
unable to lift its head up from such a position in order to breathe 
sufficiently

a person who begins shoplifting late in life may 
have a psychiatric problem that requires professional evaluation 
researchers say 
firstoffense shoplifting by people older than 60 has been 
increasing for more than a decade gary moak of the university of 
massachusetts medical school and coauthors write in the june issue 
of hospital and community psychiatry 
sociological data doesnt support the idea that economic 
hardship is to blame they said but among psychiatric 
explanations patients inability to reconcile the loss of a 
spouse or of their health job home or independence may lead to 
unconscious acting out to obtain symbolic compensation especially 
if the patient feels unfairly deprived of the loss

plan ahead 
thats the free advice college finance experts from the college 
board on down are dispensing these days to parents baffled about 
how to pay the mounting costs of four years of college 
such free advice unfortunately is worth every cent considering 
the uncertainties over the future course of tuition and what 
parents and youngsters can do to plan for it 
how worried is the public about tuition 
a survey released in june by the american home economics 
association found that paying for college tied aids as the biggest 
worries of us teens 
the average annual cost of attending a fouryear public college 
in 198788 was 5604 according to the college board at fouryear 
private schools the average was 10199 college costs at all 
institutions went up 69 percent this past year as consumer prices 
rose less than 2 percent 
making matters worse government and private student aid is 
down in 1987 such aid totaled 205 billion down 6 percent from 
1980 levels when adjusted for inflation 
for starters then its asking a lot of parents to plan and 
save for a commodity when experts cant agree on how rapidly it is 
going up in price 
consider 
during the 1980s average tuitions climbed nearly 10 percent a 
year in the 1980s double the rate of inflation and 50 percent 
faster than personal incomes according to a recent report by the 
american council on education in washington 
but go back 10 years to the 1970s and that same report finds 
tuition has gone up at a slower pace than medical care energy 
costs and the price of new homes 
so the great unsolved questions are were the doubledigit 
increases of the 1980s a fluke or the new norm and if colleges 
persist in raising their costs at breakneck speed where can 
parents find savings vehicles that can keep up 
possible solutions being considered by states the federal 
government and colleges themselves are socalled tuition 
prepayment and saving plans but even these are mired in 
uncertainty 
in june the reagan administration sent a measure called the 
college savings bond act of 1988 to congress that would grant 
families with adjusted gross incomes under 60000 taxfree 
interest on savings bonds used to pay for college 
the tax benefit would be reduced for families earning between 
60000 and 80000 and eliminated entirely for households with 
incomes above 80000 
if approved the bonds would be available beginning jan 1 
on the college side duquesne university in pittsburgh pioneered 
a plan three years ago allowing alumni parents to pay a lump sum 
the amount depending on the age of the child that would guarantee 
four years of college assuming the child was accepted for admission 
but duquesne suspended its program in march because of 
higherthanexpected tuition increases and lowerthananticipated 
earnings on investments that rendered its tuition plan 
uneconomical similar programs at the university of detroit and 
canisius college in buffalo ny are likewise at a standstill and 
not taking new applicants 
statesponsored programs meanwhile have gotten off to a slow 
start because of their uncertain tax status in march the internal 
revenue service cleared the way for michigans program allowing 
parents to participate in a prepaidtuition plan and not pay 
additional federal taxes 
michigan and florida plan to go ahead with their programs this 
year joining wyoming which already has a successful prepayment 
plan in operation 
richard cole president of the michigan education trust said 
his state hopes to start offering contracts to parents toward the 
end of july giving anyone the opportunity to purchase the 
equivalent of four years of a public college education for any 
michigan child 
the cost of a contract for a newborn child will be about 6500 
for four years of college and half that for two years cole said 
the enthusiasm far exceeds anything we ever expected i think 
several thousand will sign up immediately said cole 
but the irs ruling apparently made such plans less attractive to 
other states because it made state trusts themselves subject to 
taxation 
tennessee has dropped plans to establish a tuition prepayment 
program that was to have taken effect july 1 according to ron 
gambill executive director of the tennessee student assistance 
corp 
instead tennessee is joining a growing number of states such as 
illinois that are offering parents college savings bonds 
whether parents decide to put money aside through an organized 
plan or simply save on their own the one certainty in the 
uncertain tuition picture is that most families with some kind of 
savings plan will be in better shape than those who save nothing in 
the mistaken belief that colleges will bail them out

<TEXT>
to help parents sort out some of the confusion of paying college 
tuition the college board recently compiled a list of questions 
consumers should ask to help them decide if college prepayment or 
savings plans fill their needs 
among them 
does the plan require a minimum contribution to enter 
can anyone in the family contribute to the plan or are there 
exclusions 
can proceeds from the plan be transferred to other members of 
the family if the named beneficiarys educational plans change 
are benefits restricted to colleges in a given state or to a 
particular class of colleges such as privates 
how does the plan guarantee its benefits 
does the plan cover all costs or just tuition 
does the plan have residency requirements 
what are the refund conditions in case a student isnt 
admitted to college or dies or becomes disabled

bronwen e latimer a 24yearold new yorker who 
will be entering the columbia university school of journalism in 
the fall is studying french at the sorbonne in paris this summer 
elizabeth cohen 18 of austin texas two summers ago spent six 
weeks in salamanca spain studying spanish language and culture 
now entering her sophomore year at vassar college poughkeepsie 
ny she plans to spend her junior year in rome or florence 
studying art 
they are among tens of thousands of american students reversing 
a recent trend and going to foreign countries to study according 
to the institute of international education iie the nations 
largest education exchange agency 48483 students earned academic 
credit for studies outside the united states in 198586 up from 
27145 in 198283 nearly double the number in three years 
the study offered no explanation for the increase but 
administrators of studyabroad programs said that at least some 
students may be finding that study overseas is economical compared 
with the more expensive us schools where tuitions have been 
soaring throughout the 1980s 
beaver college in glenside pa is noted for studyabroad 
programs in which students from 225 us colleges participate the 
school is sending more than 1700 students from us campuses to 
study in the british isles and vienna this year said college 
president bette landman compared with 750 students in 198081 
landman says she believes the increase stems from an 
increasing sensitivity among students to foreign study not only to 
help their careers but especially in the last year or two to the 
kinds of understandings we as world citizens must bring to our 
lives 
at northern illinois university where the number of students in 
overseas programs has risen at least 10 percent in that period 
orville jones assistant dean of international programs says that 
since more students have traveled during their high school years 
the thought of studying overseas is no longer as strange or 
frightening 
the iie survey which does not include american students earning 
credits toward degrees in foreign institutions found that 768 
percent of us students abroad were studying in western europe 
the most popular country great britain attracted 293 percent 
of all students studying abroad followed by france with 137 
percent spain with 88 percent italy 78 percent and west 
germany 61 percent 
latin america attracted 7 percent with smaller percentages 
studying in asia the middle east eastern europe and africa 
i would hope that as the growth continues american students 
will go to developing countries in africa and latin american 
countries said richard kranos iie president 
nearly 90 percent of the students were in programs sponsored by 
us colleges and universities the survey found the most popular 
field of study was liberal arts with 182 percent followed by 
foreign language with 167 percent 
almost twothirds or 638 percent of us students abroad were 
female according to the report 
the survey was conducted by mail last year with 2896 accredited 
us colleges and universities of which 1898 reported students 
earning academic credit for study abroad 
the american institute for foreign study says it will send about 
37000 students 24000 of whom are high school students abroad 
this year 
they are realizing that it will improve their chances of 
getting into the college of their choice and it is something 
special on their resume when they go to look for their first job to 
be able to say they spent some time abroad studying says henry 
kahn president of the greenwich connbased institute 
every morning when you open the newspaper the headlines are 
from other parts of the world if young people are going to be able 
to understand and relate to our interdependent global society 
they have to study in other countries this will enable them to 
learn their languages their cultures and their unique feelings 
about the united states 
this studyabroad experience provides both personal growth and 
educational enrichment 
elizabeth cohen echoes the thought its a great thing to be

is this the end of most likely to succeed 
are there to be no more photo listings of most popular and 
best looking in the class 
well not exactly but there is a new rival zooming in on the 
traditional printed school graduation album the video yearbook 
with producers pitching video versions of everything from 
weddings to wills the high school or college yearbook apparently 
is also an alluring subject for memorabilia in motion 
unlike the traditional yearbook which may go to print midway 
through the school year the video yearbook can include endofyear 
occasions like the senior prom and graduation in most cases it 
doesnt replace the traditional album but is in addition to it 
the gruenberg video group gvg based in philadelphia started 
videovation about two years ago and has some 30 schools to date 
involved in the curriculumbased project in which the students do 
their own camerawork to record the year in school 
with guidance throughout the year from videovation staff the 
students learn about videomaking and storytelling and wind up with 
a 30minute video that they can sell to other students parents and 
others in the community 
the company edits and produces all the studentshot footage and 
puts in about three minutes of generic transitional video 
including music titles and news montages 
it costs the school about 7500 which it can make back on 
sales most schools charge about 30 or 40 for the halfhour video 
the key here says kathryn kleibacker gvg vice president 
marketing is that teachers receive a full curriculum and 
guidance on the production of their yearbook kids are really 
learning about visual literacy as well as video production 
field producers employed by gvg supervise the production by 
meeting with student teams on a weekly basis 
whats different about videovation in terms of other yearbooks 
is that the curriculum is provided as well as expert guidance and 
editing says miss kleibacker with the advent of desktop 
publishing in the computer world and other visual mediums such as 
mtv visual literary skills are going to be an important part of 
education in the future 
yearbook enterprises based in durham nc works with about 50 
colleges and high schools in teaching students how to use video 
equipment and buying the rights to songs that young filmmakers want 
to use as background music 
its educational says company president bob levitan who 
filmed duke universitys yearbook for two years before graduating 
in 1983 and he says it brings those black and white photos to 
life by capturing the excitement and emotion that a print yearbook 
cant always do 
steve sullivan head of dallasbased video yearbook inc says 
the job brings smiles in addition to profits 
ive been doing some of the shooting myself sullivan says 
the excitement you forget about it once you get out of high 
school this is one way to keep it forever

school bells can do a lot more than clang the 
clarion call to class according to an upstate new york teacher who 
is also an avid bell collector 
we learned to count by counting bells says amelia 
carpenter who teaches first grade at the chestnut hill elementary 
school in liverpool ny 
we also learned to add and subtract a bell or bells we could 
compare sizes which is larger which is smaller 
she used bells to teach geography i would show them a bell 
from india we would talk about the country and find it on the map 
on the wall 
and science what makes it ring what is it made of brass 
wood 
there is a preponderance of teachers among bell buffs says 
terry mayer head of the metropolitan new york chapter of the 
american bell association and a designer of bell jewelry 
it begins she says with the bell on the teachers desk 
commanding attention and the school bell signaling the beginning 
and changes of class and recess 
then there are the summer trips teachers make somehow 
wherever they go they are drawn to bells 
bells are a potent force in the world of the teacher they add 
a spell of enchantment to reading writing and rithmetic and they 
are always a source of comfort and cheer in the afterschool days 
and years

five years after a group of sages fired a 
rocket called a nation at risk across americas schools some 
prominent educators believe little progress has been made so far in 
rolling back the tide of mediocrity 
but another school of opinion argues that the trend indicators 
from real wage growth for teachers to burgeoning high school 
enrollments in advanced placement classes are pointing up and 
foretell brighter days ahead 
there is no gainsaying one fact americas schools are still 
riding a wave of reform and renewed public interest unprecedented 
since the soviets 1957 launch of sputnik forced political and 
educational leaders to do some prolonged soulsearching about us 
schools 
those who look at the school reform movement and see a glass at 
best halfempty include secretary of education william j bennett 
and his predecessor th bell ernest l boyer president of the 
influential carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
and the presidents of both major teacher unions mary hatwood 
futrell and albert shanker 
the most vigorous proponent of the argument that school reform 
is already paying sizeable dividends is bill honig californias 
superintendent of public instruction who has played a central role 
in efforts to toughen school curriculums and create a new national 
certification board for teachers 
a nation at risk was issued in april 1983 by an 18member 
national commission on excellence in education instructed to find 
out why scores on exams such as the scholastic aptitude test 
plummeted from 1963 through 1980 
bell the reagan administrations first secretary of education 
who personally appointed the commission and who left washington at 
the end of reagans first term writes in his memoirs the 
thirteenth man that reagan missed a chance to spark a real 
widespread educational revival 
bell now at the university of utah contends that school 
reforms such as stricter high school graduation requirements 
imposed by most states have made things better for perhaps 
twothirds of american youth 
but bell contends reforms didnt do a darn thing to solve 
the dropout problem or close the performance gap between affluent 
students and the disadvantaged many of them minorities were 
losing 30 percent to 40 percent of the rising generation says 
bell 
boyers carnegie foundation warns that the reform movement has 
largely bypassed our most deeply troubled schools in the inner 
cities the committee on economic development a policy research 
group of business executives and academic leaders came to a 
similar conclusion 
nea president futrell says the carnegie and ced reports support 
what the nea was saying five years ago that tougher standards 
wont work without a major infusion of resources for the schools 
we feel vindicated said futrell who recently proposed 
establishing at least one experimental lighthouse district in 
all 50 states where anything goes in the name of school reform 
albert shanker president of the 665000member american 
federation of teachers supports a myriad of radical school reforms 
in hundreds or even thousands of districts 
shanker is convinced that the passive structure of public 
schools with a teacher standing before a class spending most of 
the time lecturing is not working for 80 percent of all students 
not just the poor but most of the middle class as well 
he bases his case largely on the results of the 
governmentsponsored national assessment of educational progress 
tests given to a crosssection of students that show only 20 
percent of the 17yearolds left in school can write a coherent 
letter and only 6 percent can solve the type of algebraic problems 
taught in junior high 
shanker believes the only way to get markedly better results is 
to radically reorganize schools allowing teachers to work in teams 
under the guidance of lead teachers who would spend their days 
consulting preparing lessons and coaching individual students who 
would themselves work in small groups and learn the rote lessons 
from computers videotapes and other high tech tools students 
would be freed to move ahead at their own pace 
bennett contends that traditional schools are far more effective 
for disadvantaged students than shanker gives them credit for 
bennett argues that it is the poor who need most a rigorous 
classic curriculum 
in a report american education making it work unveiled at 
the white house on the fifth anniversary of a nation at risk 
bennett concludedamerican education has made some undeniable 
progress in the last few years the precipitous downward slide of 
previous decades has been arrested and we have begun the long 
climb back to reasonable standards our students have made modest 
gains in achievement they are taking more classes in basic 
subjects 
but we are certainly not doing well enough and we are not 
doing well enough fast enough we are still at risk 
californias honig voiced a sharp dissent citing the facts that 
thousands of more students in his state now are taking three years 
of math and science and 41000 earned college credit on advanced 
placement exams last year up 73 percent from 1984 
im not saying were anywhere near where we have to be but 
were on the right track said honig reform has worked for 
many kids in inner cities

americas young schoolchildren remain illiterates when it comes 
to using computers a national survey indicates but many college 
students consider the computer an important tool in career planning 
a recent study of some 24000 pupils in the third seventh and 
11th grades found that despite the socalled classroom computer 
revolution access to computers is too limited at school and at 
home schools have failed to use computers effectively and 
teachers are trained inadequately 
although some schools offer excellent computer curricula 
the survey concluded many other schools apparently do not 
provide effective instruction at least in computer applications 
and programming to a large proportion of pupils 
titled computer competence the first national assessment 
the study was undertaken by the national assessment of educational 
progress naep a project established 19 years ago by congress to 
conduct national surveys of various educational skills 
it suggests that schools have only dented the ignorance most 
students and teachers have of computers despite the huge purchases 
by many schools during the 1980s 
in 1980 15 percent of elementary schools and 50 percent of high 
schools offered computer instruction by 1985 82 percent of 
elementary schools and 93 percent of secondary schools did so 
even so more than eight of 10 seventh and 11thgraders said 
they never used computers to make a data base slightly more than 
half said they never used them to write letters stories or 
reports and roughly threequarters said they never used them to 
make graphs 
except for word processing students generally scored poorly on 
questions dealing with computer applications making graphics or 
working with data bases for example because students said they 
hardly ever got a chance to practice 
despite their poor showing 912 percent of third graders and 86 
percent of seventh graders said they liked using computers and 
more than half said they wished they used them more 
marc tucker president of the washingtonbased national center 
on education and the economy called the survey results 
disappointing 
the difference is between knowing a little about the computer 
and being able to use it effectively few american schoolchildren 
can do the latter he said 
ironically while the naep study indicates the nations young 
students remain computer illiterates in a recent survey at three 
new england colleges the use of the computer was ranked along with 
selfassessment and networking as among the most important skills 
to have while looking for a job 
the poll of more than 250 students and graduates at the 
university of rhode island and at smith college and babson college 
in massachusetts was reported by new yorkbased drake beam morin 
inc a career counseling firm 
onethird of those polled owned their own computers and more 
than onehalf said they had access to one thirteen percent said 
they would use a computer as a tool to enable them to simplify and 
organize their job search 
as for those parents whose schoolage children may be among the 
computer illiterates but who cannot afford a home computer 
industry consultants suggest several solutions 
youth groups like the girl scouts have added a technology 
badge to their program some libraries are making personal 
computers available to patrons user groups abound for the major 
hardware systems and theres always the school computer lab 
suggests mindscape inc of northbrook ill an educational 
software publisher 
the company says that with an average of only 15 minutes per day 
being spent at the classroom keyboard extra time at the home 
computer will strengthen a childs skills 
so coach them with the computer and inspire them to succeed 
it advises parents you are your childs first and most 
influential teacher be a learning advocate at home and watch your 
children progress at school and later in life

fundamental changes in the educational system 
are needed to attract students to technical fields and assure that 
the nation has enough qualified scientists and engineers according 
to a recent study by the congressional office of technology 
assessment 
the ota a research arm of congress found that though american 
schools have the capacity to produce the scientists and engineers 
needed by the nation many capable students never enter the fields 
because of a lack of money or preparation 
some experts the ota report said worry that a decline in 
collegeage students in the early 1990s and a lessened interest in 
the technical fields will cause a decline in the number of 
scientists and engineers 
despite these trends said the report shortages of scientists 
and engineers are not inevitable 
some adjustments will be made in the labor market the report 
said causing more students to go into science and engineering but 
the federal government may need to play a more active role 
the problem the report said could be attacked in two ways 
to correct shortterm shortages the government could encourage 
students to finish undergraduate and advanced degrees 
if the nation wants more scientists and engineers relatively 
quickly then retaining college and graduate students in science 
and engineering is the most useful policy strategy the report 
said it noted that currently only about 30 percent of graduates 
with bachelors degrees enter fulltime graduate level studies and 
only about half of doctoral candidates actually earn the doctoral 
degree 
those who leave unwillingly or prematurely are a rich resource 
that could be tapped the report said 
a longerterm solution is to expand and improve the talent pool 
of students willing and prepared to go into the science fields 
the years to do this are elementary school through the first 
years of college the report said increased recruitment into the 
technical fields might come through fullscale revision of 
elementary and secondary curricula tracking testing and course 
structure the report said though it noted that such a change 
will be hard to achieve given the scale of american education and 
the inertia of the existing system 
another study found that students in most other countries are 
far better educated in science than are american students 
in a report released by the national science foundation us 
students at three different grade levels all scored well behind 
those from most other nations 
for a technologically advanced country it would appear that 
in the united states a reexamination of how science is presented 
and studied is required said the study which was conducted by 
the international association for evaluation of educational 
achievement an association of research centers 
the study was conducted by the international association for 
evaluation of educational achievement an association of research 
centers early findings which compared the united states only with 
japan and england and with partial findings from israel and 
sweden were reported by the associated press in september 
the comparative study was based on tests administered to 204308 
students at 7581 schools in 24 countries between 1983 and 1986 
the tests were given at three academic levels near the end of 
primary grades at about age 10 at grades eight and nine about 
age 14 and in the final year of high school 
among 10yearolds students in japan korea and finland scored 
around 154 out of 24 possible correct answers us students 
scored just below the middle of the scale at 132 
among 14yearolds hungary japan and the netherlands scored at 
the top while americans ranked third from last with a mean score 
of 165 out of 30 possible correct answers the lowestscoring 
quarter of this age group the report said were scientifically 
illiterate with their test scores at chance level 
tests for the high school seniors were given only to those 
specializing in science subjects hong kong england and singapore 
scored highest with the united states students receiving among the 
lowest marks

the number of parttime college students in the 
average freshman class has increased 73 percent during the 1980s 
but total freshman enrollment has declined by a similar amount a 
survey shows 
the major exception to that trend private doctoral 
degreegranting universities where average parttime rolls plunged 
321 percent while freshman enrollments have risen 4 percent 
an annual report from the college board summary statistics 
annual survey of colleges 198788 included average enrollment 
data on 3134 institutions of higher education 
the survey shows that from 1980 to 1986 
the average freshman class at all kinds of institutions was 
down 74 percent 942 students to 872 twoyear public technical 
colleges experienced the biggest declines 198 percent on average 
964 students to 773 
the average institution had 1489 parttime students in 1986 
73 percent more than the 1388student average in 1980 leading 
the way were twoyear public technical colleges where average 
parttime rolls were up 247 percent from 1047 to 1306 
fulltime freshman rolls shrank 24 percent at all 
institutions and the biggest drop was at twoyear technical 
schools where the average freshman class shrank by 119 percent 
from 1264 to 1114 
minority freshman rolls at fouryear private universities rose 
15 percent the biggest increase of any kind of institution 
overall minority enrollments rose from 154 percent to 158 
percent of freshman attending all institutions 
the average number of applications to freshman classes at all 
fouryear institutions increased 63 percent the biggest average 
gains were 115 percent at public doctoral granting universities 
and 105 percent at private liberal arts colleges 
the sharp gain in parttimers results at least partly from 
aggressive marketing by colleges to attract older students said 
college board spokeswoman janice gams 
those increases have softened the impact of enrollment declines 
in the number of 18yearolds that trend is not expected to 
reverse itself until the mid1990s she said 
the college board is a nonprofit educational association whose 
members include more than 2500 secondary and higher education 
institutions

american universities have awarded more 
doctorates in education than in any other field over the past two 
decades a government study says 
education has been the most popular field of choice for 
doctoral study since 1966 said the report by the department of 
educations center for statistics 
the report based on federal surveys said that in 1966 
education held a narrow lead over the physical sciences as the most 
popular field of doctorallevel study of the 18239 doctorates 
awarded by us universities that year 3063 or 17 percent were 
in education compared to 3045 in the physical sciences 
in 1986 education was still in the no 1 spot but by a much 
wider margin it accounted for 7110 or 21 percent of the 33653 
phds awarded the physical sciences again were second with 3551 
but educations share of doctorates peaked in 1977 at 7960 and 
has declined steadily since then as fewer men pursued the advanced 
degree men outnumbered women 4to1 among the education phds in 
1966 women took the lead in 1983 and outnumbered the men in 1986 
3795 to 3315 
the report profile of education doctorates 1976 to 1986 
was written by the centers susan t hill p elaine kroe and 
summer d whitener 
education administration and supervision was the most popular 
specialty accounting for 1622 of the phds in 1986 some 787 
were in curriculum and instruction 609 in higher education 323 in 
educational psychology and 315 in counseling and personnel services 
a total of 1141 of the phds were in various subjects or

going back to school is a tough adjustment time for most 
children but for stutterers it may be particularly difficult 
children who stutter have a very natural fear of being found 
out says dr dean williams a speechlanguage pathologist at 
the university of iowa they may be afraid to speak out in class 
for fear of being laughed at or they may be frightened of meeting 
and speaking with other children during free periods they are even 
afraid of their teacher finding out they stutter 
and because they often withdraw teachers and other students 
sometimes see them as less intelligent 
this is simply not true says williams its one of the 
myths which surround stuttering children who stutter are every bit 
as bright and intelligent as their counterparts who do not 
stutter 
the speech foundation of america a nonprofit memphis tenn 
organization set up to help stutterers advises parents to take 
special time with their children at the beginning of the school 
year to discuss their fears or problems 
dont put off a childs fears as groundless or ridiculous 
williams says take them seriously and talk about them 
he says parents should also talk with school administrators and 
teachers and encourage the childs instructors to call on him as 
they would any child tell teachers not to rush or hurry the 
child and most importantly to listen let the child know that 
what he has to say is important and that there is no need to fear

educators today put too much emphasis on higher achievement 
scores and not enough on developing students inner resources 
says a university of rochester motivational psychologist 
when we judge achievement only in terms of outcomes of 
standardized tests we create a classroom climate that is 
profoundly alienating to both teachers and children says richard 
ryan who has been studying elementary schoolage children their 
parents and their teachers for some 10 years 
instead he says the emphasis should be on developing inner 
resources if children develop a sense of competence of confidence 
in approaching problems and if they learn to enjoy challenges 
then theyll go on educating themselves even after their formal 
school ends 
if kids cant write good sentences ryan says or they 
dont know where to find iran on the globe we should ask why kids 
arent internalizing instruction we should ask how can we help 
kids to take an interest in this material not how we can force it 
into them 
he compares what he calls a controlling style of teaching 
using social controls such as rewards and punishments to get 
students to perform in certain ways to an autonomyoriented 
style 
the autonomyoriented teachers give assignments that are 
more openended leaving room for a student to exercise individual 
choice 
in his evaluations at the rochester ny school ryan says he 
found that students in the controlling classrooms showed less 
inner drive to learn they didnt feel as competent and they had 
less selfconfidence that the students in the autonomyoriented 
classrooms 
and while they did about as well on tests students in the 
controlling classrooms didnt seem to grasp conceptual ideas as 
well 
a cornell university professor believes this overemphasis on 
school achievement begins with kindergarten 
but kindergarten classes should put more emphasis on fun and 
less on learning says irving lazar a professor of human service 
studies at the ithaca ny school class effectiveness should be 
judged by the number of smiles per hour he says 
all we should ask of our kindergarten is that the children be 
happy says lazar were pushing kids too hard too soon and 
theyre getting turned off to the whole process of schooling 
 
most children love to learn instead of making it so 
structured we should get out of their way 
fiveyearolds should be exposed to music and science read to 
them let them see you reading but if the kid doesnt like a 
story put the book away and get another one dont turn reading 
into a chore

parents should be careful not to overprogram 
their children with afterschool activities advises dr richard 
oberfield clinical associate professor of psychiatry at nyu 
medical center 
on top of traditional worries about grades he says more 
parents are insisting that their children become skilled in other 
areas as well from music to sports to art as a way of coping with 
an increasingly competitive environment 
instead he says parents should leave time to do absolutely 
nothing if that is what the child wants 
time to play and to relax is important he says without 
constant pressure to succeed eventually a child may even hook into 
genuine interests 
parents and children should spend that unstructured time 
together he adds 
this gives them the feeling of being cared about for 
themselves he says not just for their performance which is 
integral to their selfesteem

experience according to past surveys by the union 
the national salary figure is up by 1477 over the average of 
26534 during the 198687 school year union researchers said 
the union did not estimate how much salaries will rise this 
fall but if teachers get another 56 percent salary increase they 
will be earning 29600 on average for the 198889 school year 
the 28031 figure is an estimate based on salary data compiled

students shopping for a college should direct their own search 
but many parents make the mistake of pushing their children to the 
right school right for the parents but wrong for the child 
so says a college guide based on interviews at 50 colleges and 
high schools in 30 states and published in the july issue of 
readers digest magazine 
according to the guide the competition for entrance to 
americas top colleges has become stiffer and costs are sometimes 
higher than expected 
the first step on the road to college is learning what a good 
school looks for in an applicant and then setting out to meet 
those requirements the guide advises 
high school grades and standardizedtest scores play a part in 
the college admissions screening process but students are also 
judged on extracurricular activities work experience service to 
community and church special talents and skills 
other factors that may be considered are athletic ability 
unusual life experiences character traits and even their response 
to handicap and hardship it adds 
sometimes such seeming irrelevancies as your geographic 
location and whether you are the first generation of your family to 
attend college can be deciding factors the guide notes 
scholastic achievement is not simply based on grade average it 
adds a student must also have followed a solid collegepreparatory 
curriculum which typically means at least three to four years of 
math science social studies and a foreign languge plus four 
years of english 
and the further along students get in those areas perhaps with 
a fourth yer of foreign language or an advancedmath course like 
calculus the better their record looks to admissions officials 
you really need to start mapping out your course plan in the 
ninth grade says carol lunkenheimer director of admissions at 
northwestern university 
the quality of high school attended by the student frequently is 
taken into consideration by college officials 
you cant judge a youngster from the boondocks the same way 
you judge a student from a more sophisticated high school 
environment says richard cashwell director of undergraduate 
admissions at the university of north carolina at chapel hill 
but if youre from a less advantaged school according to the 
guide youd better be among the best of the students there and be 
able to show you took advantage of whatever challenges the school 
did offer 
in nonacademic activities factors that may be considered 
include leadership community spirit volunteerism competitive 
nature ability to work with others and sticktoitiveness 
applicants should also mention job experience the guide 
suggests because it may show problemsolving ability and a 
business sense if you are working to save money for college that 
can also demonstrate your interest in assuming responsibility 
once youve determined in general terms what youre looking for 
by far the best way to learn about a school is to visit it 
according to the guide 
every school has its own personality just like people and 
you should look for the right fit explains donald boulton the 
university of north carolinas vice chancellor of student affairs 
for those collegebound students worried about their chances of 
getting into their top choice school some consolation comes from 
charles nolan director of admissions for boston college 
many students and their parents arent satisfied with just a 
college education they must have a namebrand college if i could 
tell students and parents just one thing it would be to relax 
if you dont get into your firstchoice college it isnt the 
end of the world the course of your life probably wont be that 
much different

faulty note taking reading and review hamper a students recall 
of facts and learning material and results in poor grades and 
frustration according to the head of the chicagobased american 
learning corp 
recall is the ability to write tell or think in your own 
words what you have seen experienced or read explains robert 
baseman president of the company a subsidiary of encyclopaedia 
britannica inc 
studies have shown that most forgetting occurs during the 
first few days after one has been exposed to new material or 
studied it for the first time in fact the average student forgets 
40 to 50 percent of what hes learned in only one day and within 
two days he may forget up to 85 percent 
baseman suggests students include some review every time they 
read or complete a homework assignment in so doing he adds they 
will retain and understand more than if they wait to review a large 
amount of material such as immediately before a test 
the american learning corp administers the evelyn wood study 
dynamics program and operates more than 100 learning centers across 
the nation

children regarded as slow learners in school may actually be 
coping with an unrecognized color vision deficiency says the 
american optometric association 
the association recommends that all children have their color 
vision tested by age 5 before they enter school and use 
colorcoded learning materials to determine the approximately 7 
percent of boys and nearly 1 percent of girls who have color vision 
deficiencies 
most children are unaware of their deficiencies it says 
because they think everyone sees the way they do 
optometrists advise parents and teachers to help such children 
to identify colors by name rather than appearance labeling 
crayons markers or pencils with the colors name clothing also 
could be labeled with words or symbols so that children can select 
colorcoordinated outfits

its the only place in town that delivers 
kung pao squid veal piccata quesadilla ranchera and meat loaf 
waiters on wheels inc the citys only gourmet delivery 
service offers a plethora of entrees that gives everyone from the 
bedridden to the just plain lazy a chance to enjoy some of san 
franciscos most popular eateries without leaving home 
founded by two greek immigrants about seven months ago waiters 
on wheels took what for many takeout eaters was a choice of pizza 
or chinese food and added french wine steaks pasta dishes and an 
array of desserts 
we wanted people in the city the chance to not have to eat 
pizza said takis zarikos the companys cofounder who has 
lived in the united states for 10 years we wanted to offer them 
nice gourmet food 
last year his partner constantine stathopoulous who has lived 
in the united states for 11 years tired of having to settle for 
pizza when he did not want to cook or go out over coffee one day 
the two friends decided to form a multirestaurant home delivery 
service 
both had years of experience in the san francisco restaurant 
business zarikos as a manager and stathopoulous as a head waiter 
the plan has been a success for them waiters on wheels plans to 
add 10 new restaurants to its fall menu bringing the total to 28 
and is considering franchising east of san francisco 
there are similar companies in other cities such as chicago and 
los angeles 
to get a delivery a customer calls waiters on wheels and places 
an order from the companys 15page brochure where the restaurants 
have their own menus printed the service places the order with the 
appropriate restaurant via computer or telephone and dispatches a 
driver to pick up the order and delivers it anywhere within the 
city limits 
in addition to offering convenience to customers zarikos says 
the service can boost a restaurants revenue 
restaurants can see that it is a way to make money without 
costing them anything they can produce more without hiring 
additional help and they dont use up extra space zarikos said 
however a manager at maxs diner one of waiters on wheels 
most popular clients noted the service had some drawbacks 
sales with them have been tremendous thats the good side 
the bad side is theres a lot of food we serve that shouldnt be 
sitting around for awhile said general manager susan cercone 
meat loaf mashed potatoes and gravy arent too good after 
sitting around in styrofoam for 45 minutes 
bulls texas cafe one of waiters on wheels newest clients 
gave similarily mixed reviews a bulls manager jim greaves said 
it was relatively expensive for his resaurant to start using 
waiters on wheels for deliveries the restaurant spent nearly 700 
on various fees and packaging to bring in an additional 1700 in 
sales last month greaves said 
although it is a terrific idea one of the biggest drawbacks 
is that if a meal is not to the customers specification waiters 
on wheels requires that the restaurant not charge for it greaves 
said 
if that happened in a restaurant we could easily correct it 
but once its out to a persons house beyond our means theres 
nothing we can do

british women fought years ago to clear 
englands cramped coal mines of women and children but now a push 
is on to again open that nations mining jobs to women 
fifteen years after the first american woman broke tradition and 
went to work underground a bill is pending before parliament that 
would set aside a law prohibiting britains coal companies from 
hiring women miners says anne scargill whose husband arthur 
scargill is president of the british national union of mineworkers 
theres still some division about this even among the 
women mrs scargill said sunday at the 10th national conference 
of women miners years ago we fought to get women and children 
out of the mines 
where i live in silkstone in yorkshire we just had a 
memorial service as we put up a monument for some kids who were 
killed underground about 100 years ago about 80 kids three 
four and five years of age she said 
mrs scargill said much of the division over the issue of women 
in britains mines is generational 
its the kids who want the right to choose she said 
the num to which all british miners belong is still feeling 
the effects of a yearlong strike that idled the countrys mines in 
198485 
the strike began when the national coal board which controls 
britains nationalized mining industry proposed cutting coal 
output to the lowest level of the 20th century the plan called for 
the elimination of an estimated 20000 of britains 180000 mining 
jobs 
the residue of the bitter strike mrs scargill said is that 
we still have two lads in prison doing eight years and we still 
have 220 miners sacked 
mrs scargill accompanied by a group of other british mining 
wives traveled to the us to explore the common ground they share 
with american women miners 
much of that common ground was found in the ways they dealt with 
the economic hardship of their long strike in this country the 
problem is the unemployment that has ravaged the coal industry in 
the last eight years but the hardships have been much the same 
the women here theyre the same as us mrs scargill said 
theyve got the same kind of things going that we did during the 
strike the support groups the food pantries and soup kitchens we 
needed to feed our families

louis a marckesano an airline industry analyst with janney 
montgomery scott inc in philadelphia said sunday braniffs market 
position wedged between the commuter airlines and the major 
carriers will make its survival difficult 
that doesnt mean that they cant succeed marckesano said 
adding he doesnt expect any rapid expansion or downsizing of the 
airline i dont think well know the answer to that for a while 
they still have to find themselves a niche that they can survive in 
long term

deal that values the airline at 111 million

city international airport since the beginning of the year 
outgoing braniff chairman j patrick foley said the new 
management will continue the expansion 
braniff primarily serves the southwest but analysts have 
speculated it may try to reduce its operations at dallasfort 
worth where there is strong competition between american airlines 
and delta air lines

owned by the pritzker family of chicago bia is paying 7 a share 
in cash and a pro rata share of 20 percent of the restructured

airlines friday to manage braniff the executives led by new 
chairman william mcgee flew to dallas sunday and were expected to 
meet the companys employees and local media today

our nations air travel and hospitality industries jeffrey r 
chodorow one of bias leading investors said in a statement 
saturday he could not be reached at his philadelphia home for 
comment sunday 
the investor group has pledged to protect the jobs of braniffs 
2600 employees for at least three years 
dalfort owned 64 percent of the airlines common stock and all 
of its series a preferred stock which gave it more than 90 percent 
of the stock voting rights 
dalfort will continue to hold a large equity stake in braniff

trading today reflecting concern about the dollar and the 
direction of interest rates here and abroad 
the treasurys 30year bond was off about point or 5 per 
1000 face amount by midday its yield which moves inversely to 
its price climbed to 892 percent from 885 percent late friday 
trading started out on a down note following a drop in us bond 
prices overseas despite the dollars continued strength 
robert brusca chief economist for nikko securities co 
international said bond investors were worried that the dollars 
rise in recent days could be coming to an end especially amid 
reports of centralbank intervention against the us currency 
i think at this point everyone realizes the dollar probably 
has an upside that will be limited at some point he said if 
the dollar draws back people dont want to be involved in bonds 
a strong dollar is seen as bullish for the credit markets 
because it makes dollardenominated bonds and notes more attractive 
to foreigners while lessening the prospects for higher inflation 
brusca said bond traders also were concerned today that interest 
rates may be on the rise worldwide 
there is widespread speculation that britain west germany and 
japan might move to push up rates and that the federal reserve 
would be forced to reciprocate to remain competitive 
in addition the fed faces the prospect of higher inflation due 
to strongerthanexpected growth in the us economy inflation 
erodes the value of fixedincome securities

shortterm governments declined point intermediate maturities 
fell between point and point and longterm issues were down 
around point according to figures provided by telerate inc a

movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a

the strength of the japanese yen has made toyko 
the worlds most expensive city for expatriates for the third 
straight year according to a survey of 103 cities worldwide 
released monday 
the japanese port city of osaka was a close second followed by 
the iranian capital tehran according to a biannual survey by 
business international a genevabased research and consulting firm 
the study uses a weighted index based on items including food 
alcohol household supplies tobacco utilities clothing and 
entertainment but excludes housing it is aimed at helping 
international companies determine costofliving differentials for 
their expatriate employees 
using new york as the base for the study with a value of 100 
tokyo had an index rating of 221 osaka 219 and tehran 192 the 
survey said 
new york was tied for 33rd place with chicago and san francisco 
the most expensive us city was los angeles in 30th place 
followed by washington dc 
the drop in value of the us dollar against european currencies 
continued to make european cities expensive for expatriates who are

about 2 billion in design and construction 
costs of the diablo canyon nuclear power plant would be paid by 
utility shareholders under a settlement proposed today by the 
operating company and state officials 
the settlement also would increase electricity rates for pacific 
gas amp electric co customers 16 percent effective friday and 13 
percent on jan 1 each of the next three years 
rates in future years would be based on how well the plant 
operates under a system of performancebased pricing that has 
never been used for a major power plant in california usually 
utilities are allowed to charge rates based on how much of their 
construction costs were found to be reasonable 
the settlement was announced by pgampe the staff of the 
california public utilities commission and state attorney general 
john van de kamp it is subject to approval by the full commission 
the company said it would take a onetime charge of 500 million 
and reduce cash dividends to help absorb the cost of diablo canyon 
the plant located near an earthquake fault on the san luis 
obispo coast originally was to begin operating in the mid1970s 
but design errors discovery of the magnitude of the earthquake 
fault and federal licensing problems delayed operation by about a 
decade and multiplied the cost 13fold 
last year the utility commissions division of ratepayer 
advocates recommended the utility not be allowed to collect 44 
billion of the plants original 55 billion costs by raising 
rates additions to the plant since have pushed the total cost to 
58 billion 
under todays settlement pgampe would face no specific 
disallowance 
however the 500 million charge is expected to virtually 
eliminate the companys 1988 earnings after taxes and the company 
will have to reduce its cash dividend from 192 per share to a new 
annualized rate of 140 per share 
under the performancebased arrangement if diablo canyon 
operates as well as the average large us nuclear plant about 
21 billion of the construction cost will be charged to 
shareholders and customers would pay the rest van de kamp said 
the more efficiently the plant operates the more of the cost 
customers would pay on the other hand they would pay less for 
other fuels that pgampe would have to use when the plant was shut 
down 
pgampe officials said the settlement means customers will 
initially pay about 25 percent less for power from diablo canyon 
than if the company had gotten permission to fully recover the 
plants costs 
the company said rates will increase only by about 5 percent 
under the proposed settlement 
a public hearing on the settlement is scheduled for wednesday 
the agreement is subject to approval by the public utilities 
commission whose members were not part of the negotiations 
bill ahern director of the utility commissions division of 
ratepayer advocates hailed the proposed settlement as a 
tremendously good deal for pgampes customers 
it provides at least 2 billion in customer savings over the 
next few years and it shifts the financial risks of runaway 
nuclear plant costs and poor plant operation from the customers to 
pgampes stockholders he said 
in a letter to shareholders pgampes chairman and chief executive 
officer richard a clarke said the settlement provided the best 
alternative for shareholders including the potential for 
substantial earnings growth over time

the senate voted monday to slash the proposed 
1989 internal revenue service budget by 241 million and use the 
money for the customs services antidrug program 
the antidrug measure was part of a larger bill that also calls 
for a 4 percent pay increase in 1989 for all federal civilian 
employees except members of congress and 41 percent for military 
personnel the senate approved an amendment requiring that no 
future pay increase for members of congress take effect until voted 
on separately by the house and senate 
the white house had opposed reducing the irs spending it 
cautioned that the impact of this reduced level on returns 
processsing and taxpayer services would be devastating irs 
commissioner lawrence b gibbs had complained that the reduction 
could cut revenues by 14 billion next year 
the cut in the irs budget to the 1988 level of just under 51 
billion was part of a bill that included 159 billion for the 
treasury department and its agencies the postal service and 
several other federal agencies the vote was 814 
the spending bill is 246 million less than the administration 
asked and 1963 million below what the house passed the measure 
is about 801 million over what was appropriated for the same 
agencies for 1988 
when he sent his budget to congress in january president reagan 
asked for a 241 million increase for the irs to improve the 
speed and accuracy of tax processing and expand information 
services provided to taxpayers in light of the 1986 tax overhaul 
the house agreed 
when the senate panel was considering the appropriations bill 
last week james c miller iii director of the white house office 
of management and budget said that holding the irs budget to this 
years level would jeopardize service to the public both in terms 
of taxpayer inquiries and timely returns processing 
these areas are particularly high priorities of the 
administration given the need to implement tax reform fully and 
the desire to avoid repeating the disruptions of the 1985 filing 
season miller wrote 
however the senate committee concluded that the level of 
funding proposed by the committee will allow the irs to meet its 
revenueraising targets established in the deficitreduction 
agreement reached by the white house and congress last year 
the bill includes 105 billion for the customs service which 
is 79 million above what the administration requested and 41 
million over what the house passed 
i am proud to say that this bill goes the extra mile beyond 
the presidents budget to maintain our important antidrug effort 
at some of the most important drug enforcement agencies said 
sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the senate 
appropriations subcommittee on the treasury postal service and 
general government which wrote the measure 
as part of the customs service efforts against illegal drugs 
the bill recommends the agency buy a surveillance airship capable 
of carrying a sensor that can detect ship movements in the gulf of 
mexico the measure includes money for customs to develop four 
longrange p3 orion planes to use in drug surveillance missions 
the senate approved an amendment by sen paul simon dill 
suggesting that the postal service not activate the second part of 
a contract with perot systems corp until the general accounting 
office studies the contract the corporation headed by billionaire 
h ross perot would get a share of the profits from costsaving 
suggestions it made to the postal service 
simon contends such a lucrative contract should not have been 
awarded without bids

the dollar has soared to its highest levels 
against european currencies in eight months but market watchers 
remained divided monday about whether the currencys weekslong 
rally represents a lasting reversal or a temporary blip 
fundamentally the dollar has now changed its trend and 
instead of trending lower all those years since 1985 the dollar is 
in an upward move asserted paul chertkow director of currency 
economics at the london investment firm hoare govett ltd 
but geoffrey dennis an international economist at james capel 
and co said markets have gotten themselves quite excited about 
the dollar shortterm we think were going to see new lows still 
after months of stability the dollar has jumped 5 percent 
against the british pound 44 percent against the japanese yen and 
37 percent against the west german mark in home currency markets 
since last monday 
the dollar surged monday to its highest point against the 
british pound since october the pound fell 4 cents to 17030 by 
late afternoon in europe from 17430 on friday on news of a 
worsethanexpected record british merchandise trade deficit in 
may 
the dollar jumped to 18185 west german marks from 18010 marks 
on friday also the highest level since october 
earlier in tokyo the dollar rose 200 yen to a closing 13170 
yen in tokyo its highest level since early december 
the dollar has been helped by improvements in the us trade 
deficit and strong demand for dollardenominated securities 
especially by the japanese 
in addition speculators have been able to push the dollar 
higher without a concerted effort by central banks to counter their 
attempt dealers said 
the us federal reserve did intervene a bit on monday selling 
dollars which along with a bit of profittaking took some steam 
out of the rally dealers said the west german bundesbank also 
intervened in a limited way as it has in recent weeks 
but the sessions intervention although a warning was not 
significant or concerted dealers said 
the dollar has been boosted by the communique issued at the end 
of the world economic summit in toronto last week which led the 
markets to believe that the seven major industrialized nations 
would tolerate a higher dollar to counter inflation 
the industrialized countries again reiterated their commitment 
to stabilize currency exchange rates which they first made in 
february 1987 in september 1985 they had agreed to push the 
dollar lower 
what were seeing is an acknowledgement by the group of seven 
countries following their meeting in toronto that they they have 
given some scope for the dollar to rise said tim odell senior 
international economist at the london investment firm phillips and 
drew ltd 
support also has come from growth in global demand for the 
dollar particularly from japanese financial institutions such as 
life insurance companies which are buying up us stocks and bonds 
again for the first time in months dealers said 
relatively high us interest rates have made dollardenominated 
investments more attractive analysts said 
the dollar remains strong even though interest rates in britain 
and west germany have been rising in recent weeks which would make 
investments in those countries more competitive 
the strong demand for the dollar underscored by high trading 
volume in the foreign exchange markets in turn has spurred 
speculative interest in the currency dealers said 
the gain has been feeding on itself since the dollar leaped past 
several psychological barriers such as 18 west german marks and 
130 japanese yen 
it was the release of betterthanexpected us trade data two 
weeks ago that set the scene for the dollars climb analysts said 
the commerce department reported on june 14 that the merchandise 
trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted 989 billion in 
april its lowest level since 1984 from 117 billion dollars in 
the previous month 
but the outlook for the dollar is unclear 
there is a lot more upside potential said the bullish 
chertkow forecasting a dollar of 19 marks and 135 yen 
but it is not known how high a level the central banks would 
allow 
there may be a level that is a new ceiling or a range agreed 
to in toronto odell said 
several dealers speculated that the central banks would not step 
in together until the markets recent bullishness was spent 
some analysts said the longterm trend is bearish because of the 
stilllarge us trade deficit fears of inflation in europe and 
the uncertainty presented by the us general election 
there isnt much scope for the dollar to rise on a sustained 
basis odell said

share prices skidded lower monday on the london 
stock exchange following the release of a dismal trade deficit 
report for may 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed 298 
points or 16 percent lower at 18415 
trading volume was a modest 3907 million shares compared with 
fridays 5890 million shares 
dealers said there was severe disappointment that britains 
merchandise trade gap soared to a record 1705 billion pounds or 
29 billion in may with imports running at their highest level 
since last summer 
analysts had predicted the trade gap would range from 900 
million pounds or 15 billion to 12 billion pounds or 204 
billion 
the pound plummeted 4 cents against the dollar on the news 
ending at 17030 
the government report was really ghastly and beyond even the 
worst expectations said glenn davies an economist at 
clalexanders laing cruickshank ltd 
the problem for equities is that the only option at this 
moment available to the government to curtail domestic demand is to 
raise base interest rates davies said 
a dealer said the figures were so bad that they beg for severe 
measures and its only a question of how quickly and by how much 
the government will put up interest rates 
several market watchers predicted a half percentagepoint rise 
to 95 percent in the british commercial banks base lending rate 
as soon as tuesday with another halfpoint hike sometime during 
the week if the british currency does not show signs of recovery

ibm has caught some other companies off guard 
with a gettough position on patents for a burgeoning new computer 
technology known as risc 
ibm confirmed monday it has approached some companies about 
their use of ibm patents in products that use risc short for 
reduced instruction set computer 
risc is considered critical to the future of the computer 
industry because it dramatically speeds up computing by simplifying 
the instructions that microprocessors have to perform 
spokesmen for several companies that have used risc technology 
in the design of new microprocessors said their lawyers had not 
been contacted by ibm and they did not know what the computer giant 
wanted 
ibms policy on risc was first reported in saturdays editions 
of the new york times it was consistent with ibms statement 
earlier this year that it intended to be more rigorous in its 
enforcement of its patents 
ibm said monday its more than 9000 us patents go well beyond 
risc to include technology that is fundamental to the computer 
industry 
in a farreaching statement it said we believe that anyone 
who is developing an informationhandling system would probably 
need to use an ibm patent 
ibm is not trying to shut down competitors using risc the 
company has said it is willing to license all of its patents to 
other companies for reasonable terms and conditions 
sun microsystems inc the fastgrowing silicon valley 
workstation maker would seem to be a prime target for ibm 
enforcement because it has a popular new chip called sparc that is 
based on risc technology suns design has been adopted by such 
companies as unisys corp xerox corp and american telephone amp 
telegraph co 
but sun spokeswoman carol broadbent said monday we have not 
been approached well just have to wait and see if ibm does 
approach and what kind of move they make 
at motorola inc whose new 88000 family of microprocessors is 
riscbased spokesman charles sengstock said all we know is 
essentially what weve read 
at advanced micro devices inc which uses risc technology in 
its new 29000 chip family spokesman john greenagel said we have 
not been contacted by them so were kind of in the dark as to what 
might be going on 
greenagel said he was pleased by reports that ibm its biggest 
customer does not intend to try to shut down other companies 
using risc 
if ibm thinks there is a problem with us well give it very 
careful attention but at this point were not aware what this 
problem may be greenagel said 
ibm announced earlier this year that in new licensing 
agreements it was asking licensees to pay it from 1 percent to 5 
percent of the revenue from products that use ibm patents 
depending on the number of patents used and the extent of their use 
many companies already have crosslicensing agreements with ibm 
that would protect them from having to pay for use of patents risc 
or otherwise

pillsbury co said monday its fourthquarter 
profit rose 51 percent but its earnings for all of fiscal 1988 
fell 62 percent compared with a year earlier because of a huge 
restructuring charge 
earnings for the three months ended may 31 rose to 478 
million or 56 cents a share from 316 million or 37 cents a 
share a year earlier sales in the fourth quarter rose 1 percent to 
155 billion from 153 billion 
for the full year net earnings fell to 693 million or 81 
cents a share compared with 1819 million or 210 a share in 
fiscal 1987 
annual sales rose slightly to 619 billion from 613 billion 
the restructuring reduced earnings for the full year by 1409 
million or 164 per share but none of it was booked in the 
fourth quarter 
periodically every company must make the necessary changes to 
reestablish itself in the marketplace william h spoor 
pillsburys chairman and chief executive officer said in a 
statement we have now entered fiscal 1989 with direction 
confidence and discipline 
the restructuring charge covered the sale of the godfathers 
pizza quik wok bay street and key west grill restaurant chains 
and 30 steak and ale and bennigans restaurants it also covered a 
writedown of assets at burger king the consolidation of several 
food manufacturing plants and a reduction in administrative 
personnel throughout the company 
for fiscal 1988 the companys foods division posted a 6 percent 
sales gain to 356 billion on a 1 percent increase in unit volume 
operating profit rose 6 percent to 2805 million 
excellent performances were turned in by the refrigerated dough 
ice cream international and industrial divisions spoor said but 
he said weaknesses in pizza and seafood held back profit growth 
in the fourth quarter food sales rose 9 percent to 9046 
million and unit sales rose 5 percent but operating profit slipped 
2 percent to 512 million 
in the restaurant division sales fell 5 percent for the year to 
263 billion and operating profit fell 8 percent to 2172 million 
spoor attributed the decline to flat sales at individual units 
and to a drop in sales at the companys restaurant supply 
subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter pillsburys restaurant sales declined 8 
percent to 649 million and operating profit declined 10 percent to 
65 million 
the decline was attributed to a decline in its restauarnt supply 
subsidiary and at its fullservice restaurants where profit was off 
sharply because of the expense of new menus training and 
additional staffing

an illinois company that said it hadnt used 
leadlined tanks in its water coolers is being asked to recall its 
coolers in the wake of a report that some of its tanks had been 
lined with lead solder 
the request was made last week by rep henry waxman dcalif 
chairman of the health and environment subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee after the environmental protection 
agency told waxman and the company of its test results 
epa which discovered lead in water from coolers used by the 
navy last year tested 20 navy coolers 12 of them made by halsey 
taylor of freeport ill a subsidiary of household international 
inc according to documents provided by a subcommittee source 
eight of the 12 had been lined with lead solder which is 50 
percent lead water from one of them was contaminated with lead at 
a concentration of 2000 parts per billion 40 times the current 
federal drinking water standard and 100 times the standard epa 
expects to adoptlater this year 
two coolers with solderlined tanks were missing identification 
tags the other six carried model numbers wt8a gc10a and gc10acr 
according to a letter from epa to the company 
lead is a poison that damages the brain kidneys and other 
organs children are particularly vulnerable because their brains 
are still being formed 
halsey taylor a leader in the refrigerated water cooler 
industry made coolers using lead solder to connect piping from 
1978 to 1987 until this february it also used lead solder to coat 
the outside of the reservoir tank for better heat transfer 
in 1979 it inspected 14000 coolers whose tanks might have had 
pinhole leaks that permitted the outside solder coating to get 
inside during manufacture said tom klein director of marketing 
for halsey taylor he said many were repaired but he did not have 
the number at hand 
the company wrote waxman in february that it had never 
designed or manufactured a water coller that used a leadlined or 
lead tank it was clear from context that the company was 
referring to inside not outside lining 
michael cook head of epas water office said in an interview 
friday it was conceivable the eight tanks also had leaks but 
he did not think so because the solder is in a uniform layer 
inside 
cook said epa had offered tank samples on which the company 
could run its own tests and was awaiting a response klein said the 
company had asked for those samples and was unaware of cooks offer 
a company representative had seen the tanks he said and cook 
was correct that the solder seemed to coat the inside of the tank 
uniformly however that could have happened from the same 
malfunction that cause the 1979 inspection and repair program he 
said and the company believes cooks tanks came from the same 
batch of more than 38000 that possibly could have pinhole leaks 
klein said 
we are not hiding our head in the sand we are cooperating 
with congressman waxman said klein weve gone the extra step 
to make sure our the coolers are safe by switching to a nonlead 
solder for tank coating in february 
he repeated that the company had never manufactuered a cooler 
with a lead tank or lead inside lining as far as it knew weve 
checked our records on this and were checking them again 
rep gerry sikorski dminn a member of the subcommittee 
planned to introduce a bill wednesday to require epa to help 
schools test and renovae water systems contaminated by lead to 
forbid the sale of leadcontaining coolers and to require 
manufacturers to recall any previously sold and to force epa to 
make the new standard 10 ppb instead of 20 ppb 
epa has estimated that 42 million americans use tap water 
containing lead above 20 ppb of which 38 million are children 
under age 6 approximately 241000 children under 6 are getting 
enough lead to harm them the agency says 
the water test corp of manchester nh wrote waxman that it 
would test samples without charge for schools that request it 
schools would have to get sample bottles from the company and pay 
shipping charges

sales of existing homes propelled by fears of 
rising mortgage rates rose 31 percent in may the fourth 
consecutive monthly increase a real estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said that existing 
singlefamily homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 363 million units in may following an even larger 57 percent 
increase in april 
john tuccillo chief economist for the realtors group said that 
existing home sales will probably begin to decline in coming months 
to around an annual rate of 34 million units as mortgage rates 
move higher 
the anticipation of continued rising interest rates convinced 
homebuyers to get into the market now rather than waiting 
tuccillo said existing home sales are at a peak right now and we 
would expect sales to drop late in the year because of slowly 
rising rates 
fixedrate mortgage which had dipped to a low of 984 percent 
in february have been rising and now stand at 104 percent 
according to the latest weekly survey by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 
the median price of an existing home rose 1300 from april to 
may climbing to 88600 a 3 percent increase from the median 
sales price a year ago of 86000 
the may sales increase was led by a 104 percent rise in sales 
in the northeast where homes were sold at an annual rate of 
740000 units sales rose 32 percent in the midwest to an annual 
rate of 960000 units 
sales in the south rose 23 percent to an annual rate of 134 
million units while sales advanced 16 percent in the west to an 
annual rate of 620000 units 
of the four regions the northeast was again the leader in the 
rate of price increases with a median sales price of 148700 last 
month 11 percent higher than a year ago 
in the west the median price of 122000 was 102 percent 
higher than in may 1987 the midwest posted a 27 percent price 
increase to 68300 while in the south the median sales price of 
83600 was 16 percent higher than a year ago 
the association is forecasting that 334 million existing homes 
will be sold this year a decline of 51 percent from the 353 
milion homes sold in 1987

the first shipment to japan of 5000 
panasonic television sets built at a suburban chicago left monday 
amid fanfare and predictions that it would be the first of many 
hopefully this is just a small beginning to what ultimately 
will lead to a more balanced trading situation between all 
countries of the world but especially the united states and 
japan said richard kraft president of matsushita industrial 
co a subsidiary of the japanese consumer giant matsushita which 
markets some of its products under the panasonic brand name 
the 27inch color television sets were part of an initial order 
of 5000 sets while usmade materials account for about 70 
percent of each set kraft noted the televisions are virtually 
unusuable in this country because the settings the power supply 
and the frequencies are adapted for foreign use 
japan is a different market and these sets today represent an 
honest attempt to market and sell a product based on conditions 
there not just send over whatever we build he added 
with this kind of thinking and this kind of product we can 
make genuine inroads said kraft 
he said matsushita decided to build the sets in franklin park 
because of savings of about 10 percent and the availability of 
american craftsmen to design and build the cabinets out of us 
hardwoods 
kraft said he could not estimate what the set would cost in 
japan but a comparable product for the us market would range 
between 1500 and 2000 
state department of commerce spokesman wally biermann said 
exports from illinois to japan were up 46 percent for the first 
four months of this year compared to last 
these are not just gestures of goodwill but hardcore 
economic decisions paul oconnor another state commerce 
department spokesman said if the dollar remains weak against the 
yen youll see more and more of this 
gov james r thompson joined executives and 800 workers for a 
brief ceremony at the plant which manufactures more than one 
million sets for the north american market

thomson mckinnon securities

macmillan inc reaffirmed monday its earlier 
rejection of a 19 billion takeover proposal from a group led by 
texas investor robert bass 
the publishing and information services giant said a special 
committee of its board had also reaffirmed that the company is not 
for sale 
macmillan and the robert m bass group are scheduled to square 
off wednesday in a delaware chancery court over whether macmillan 
will be allowed to proceed with a restructuring plan that it 
offered earlier this month 
in trading on the new york stock exchange macmillan slipped 25 
cents a share to 7450 
macmillans plan includes paying a special dividend of 5235 a 
share in cash and splitting the company into two parts publishing 
and information services 
the plan had been proposed after the bass group said it wanted 
to discuss a takoever of the entire company at 64 a share 
it subsequently boosted its offer to 73 a share in cash or 
alternatively a restructuring identical to what macmillan proposed 
except that it included a higher dividend of 58 a share 
in its statement on monday macmillan said its special committee 
felt that the bass groups plan does not contribute any added value 
to the operation of macmillan as they have no experience or 
business knowhow in the publishing and information fields 
macmillan said its restructuring plan will maintain the 
tradition of editorial independence and integrity which has served 
the public for 145 years and will insure the continued quality of 
macmillans teaching and information products 
the court hearing which was to be held monday in delaware 
chancery court before vice chancellor jack b jacobs has been 
resceduled for 2 pm edt wednesday a spokesman for the court said 
earlier this month jacobs granted basss request for a temporary 
injunction blocking the restructuring at wednesdays hearing 
jacobs will hear arguments concerning a preliminary injunction 
which would void the proposed restructuring

a special crop production forecast will be 
issued in two weeks to reflect the drought that is shriveling corn 
wheat and other harvest prospects in much of the nation a senior 
agriculture department official said monday 
the special forecast will be issued in usdas regular crop 
report on july 12 and will include new figures adjusted for damage 
done by this years heat and drought said assistant secretary ewen 
m wilson who oversees the departments economic and statistical 
services 
under normal conditions the july crop report would include 
updated production and yieldperacre estimates for winter wheat 
which is now being harvested across the nations midsection 
similar field estimates for corn spring wheat soybeans cotton 
and other fallharvested crops are not scheduled until august 
that has not changed the august crop report will still be the 
first bigscale estimate of us crops wilson said 
but the july 12 report will include freshly revised 
projections of corn and other fall crops based on the latest 
drought and acreage information he said the projections now being 
used began in may based on past trends and other assumptions that 
no longer apply 
wilson in an interview disclosed that the 198889 projections 
based on the trendlines of past years would be wrong and that we 
would be way off the right numbers for this years harvests 
were going to move away from that trendyield estimate and 
make some adjustments based on what we know about crop 
conditions he said we wont be doing a field survey because 
its too early in the season but well do some analysis which will 
move us off that trendline yield in order to reflect the impact of 
the drought 
wilson said the special project to come up with better figures 
for harvest prospects and anticipated demand through the 198889 
marketing season was not unique and that usda had done it before 
asked if usda economists and statisticians werent sticking 
their necks out regarding drought losses wilson said i think 
were in a year where if they put out a trendline projection 
they would be sticking their necks out even more because clearly 
no one believes the trend yield is going to the the actual yield 
this year its reflecting reality 
earlier this month when the winter wheat harvest was updated 
the supplyanddemand analysis based on the trend lines described 
by wilson included projections showing that this falls corn 
harvest would be around 73 billion bushels an increase from 706 
billion bushels harvested in 1987 
soybean production using the trendline method was projected 
on june 9 at 188 billion bushels just slightly less than the 19 
billion bushels produced last year

americans should be more aware of the 
potential of lead poisoning from imported ceramic ware that does 
not meet us standards the head of the food and drug 
administration told congress on monday 
although the agency has stepped up its spot checks in recent 
years fda commissioner frank e young acknowledged that it will 
never be able to check each shipment he noted that that it lacks 
authority to inspect foreign plants where the products originate 
even if the fda budget was expanded to allow it to make more 
spot checks of imports and if the agency was authorized to make 
spot checks in foreign plants young pointed out that much of the 
glazed pottery coming into the united states is purchased abroad by 
tourists and military personnel often from small village 
operations 
still more he said comes in from mexico as either small 
informal entries as personal belongings of members of the 
mexicanamerican community living along the border or as gifts or 
individual pieces purchased by us tourists 
the thousands of trucks and automobiles crossing the border 
simply cannot be effectively inspected or their cargos tested for 
lead said young 
he added that a new program under which the fda has contracted 
with state officials in colorado and new mexico to sample mexican 
dinnerware from local retailers has revealed that more than 10 
percent of the items sampled have leached excess levels of lead 
the fda ordered 20 recalls of ceramic ware in fiscal 1987 
compared with nine in the preceeding five years of the 27 recalls 
only one lot was manufactured in the united states 
rep ron wyden dore who chaired the hearing of the oversight 
and investigations panel of the house energy and commerce 
committee said there are serious deficiencies in the fdas 
efforts to control ceramic ware 
background material distributed by the committee said the fda 
for example has only one inspector to police the entire port of 
houston 
however wyden also acknowledged that a major part of the 
hearing he organized was educational 
in view of the widespread lack of knowledge about the nature 
and extent of the risks posed by defective ceramicware and 
glassware one of the major purposes of todays hearing is to 
inform the public about such risks he said without adequate 
education about this problem many individuals will continue to 
purchase dangerous items for food service 
young said there is no way to know whether ceramic ware is 
defective by visually inspecting it 
consumers thus need to be alerted to this potential hidden 
danger he said this hearing should help 
officials say the most risky ceramic dinnerware are poorly fired 
pitchers cups and other vessels they are especially dangerous 
when filled with acidic liquids such as coffee orange juice or 
wine which can speed the breakdown of the glazes containing lead 
potters have used pulverized lead for years to give a sheen and 
rich color to ceramic products firing the glaze at high enough 
temperatures binds the lead to the surface but inadequate firing 
can result in the glazes degrading over time from use and releasing 
microscopic particles of lead 
one of the main problems is that ceramic items labeled for 
decorative use only do not have to pass fda leadleach standards 
yet sometimes are used for food preparation or serving

the senate stood firm on requiring companies 
to give employees advance notice of largescale layoffs monday 
refusing to drop the provision from a bill calling for prior 
warning of plant closings 
this is a blueprint for employers who want to disobey the 
plantclosing law itself said sen howard m metzenbaum dohio 
in urging the senate to retain the layoff provision 
employers would simply lay them off piece by piece bit by 
bit until there was nothing left he said 
the senate voted 6332 to table or kill a proposal to drop the 
layoff provision from the larger plantclosings notification bill 
the proposal to drop the layoffs provision was the major 
amendment offered thus far by critics of the bill after lawmakers 
acted on it however they became snarled in debate over further 
limiting moves and majority leader robert c byrd dwva gave up 
hope of a final vote monday 
byrd said he still was hoping for a vote tuesday but before the 
senate halted work for the night he took steps to invoke cloture 
or shut off debate later in the week 
the move to drop the layoff provision was made by sen nancy 
kassebaum rkan it would have sharply altered the plantclosings 
measure which until recently was part of the 1000page omnibus 
trade bill 
president reagan vetoed the trade bill may 24 singling out the 
plantclosings provision for special criticism he said it would 
hamstring managers attempting to operate their companies at peak 
efficiency 
the plantclosings measure was deleted from the trade bill and 
reconstituted as a separate piece of legislation after the senate 
sustained reagans veto 
the bill would require companies with at least 100 employees to 
provide advance notice of layoffs involving at least 50 workers as 
well as notification of fullscale plant closings 
labor unions have had some form of the plantclosings 
legislation on their congressional shopping list for 15 years 
critics said the bill was too broad and thus bound to set off 
lawsuits and squabbles they said dropping the layoff provision 
represented one way to impose some limits 
a layoff of 50 employees at a 10000employee manufacturing 
plant would not be a plant closing to most people but it is under 
terms of this legislation said sen orrin hatch rutah 
house speaker jim wright dtexas told reporters monday morning 
that he would call the plantclosings measure for a vote in his 
chamber on wednesday 
he also said he would seek a house vote wednesday on the 
reconstituted trade bill which has been shorn not only of the 
plantclosings provision but of curbs on export of alaska oil and 
refined petroleum products
