the reactor on japans only nuclear ship has been 
started for the first time since it was shut down 16 years ago due 
to a radiation leak 
no leakage of radiation was recorded during thursdays 12hour 
test aboard the 8242ton mutsu anchored at sekinehama in northern 
japan officials of the governments atomic energy reserach 
institute said 
the freighter developed a leak in its radioactive shield on its 
maiden voyage in 1974 and drifted for 50 days before city 
residents allowed it to return temporarily several other cities 
refused to berth the stricken vessel 
in 1981 government officials agreed to build a new port for the 
ship at sekinehama an isolated spot on the pacific ocean near its 
former home port mutsu city 
the ships reactor was extensively remodeled after the leak 
the officials said the tests of the reactor would continue and 
if successful the mutsu will conduct several test cruises to 
collect data for possible future development of nuclearpowered 
commercial vessels it then will be scrapped they said

a graduate student whose 8foot 
canvas of the purdue university president clad only in socks was 
removed from an exhibit says he was simply trying to be provocative 
artist david loewenstein 23 said thursday that his painting of 
president steven c beering was tame and designed to spark 
discussion about the right to display controversial art 
theres a lot more art that is done that is more explicit 
loewenstein said 
beering did not pose for the painting nor has he made a public 
statement about it 
i wanted to do something provocative and see how people would 
align themselves while at the same time doing something risky fun 
and mischievous he said it doesnt happen enough at purdue 
gary sudano director of purdues department of creative arts 
removed the painting from a campus art gallery after loewenstein 
refused to withdraw it 
we have exhibition space in our buildings which is reserved 
for the display of works of art that arise from the instructional 
program sudano said thursday we dont provide a forum for 
public displays of personal points of view thats not our 
mission 
sudano said loewenstein has other paintings on display in the 
three campus galleries but all were from classes the student had 
taken

the powerful 15 billion hubble 
space telescope is safe inside the shuttle discovery free from 
certain bugs but not others 
technicians installed the telescope thursday after ridding a 
payload preparation room at the launch pad of 40 small mosquitolike 
insects called midges engineers feared the midges might damage the 
fragile instrument and its 8foot primary optical mirror 
about the time the last insect was snared bugs of a more 
technical nature were discovered 
a spark igniter on one of discoverys three main engines did not 
receive continuous power and was replaced and an electronics 
package on another engine needed to be replaced because of an 
internal circuitry problem 
the problems were considered minor and nasa today planned to 
test the electrical connections between the hubble and discovery a 
final check will be made of the telescopes systems and its 
scientific instruments on sunday 
the 25000pound telescope will tested to ensure it is in remote 
communications with nasas goddard space flight center in 
greenbelt md and lockheed missiles and space co in sunnyvale 
calif 
discoverys payload bay doors will remain open until two days 
before the scheduled april 12 launch so the telescopes batteries 
can be charged nasa has said the mission may be moved up a day or 
two because flight preparations are running ahead of schedule 
the twoday delay in installing the hubble had no effect on the 
launch schedule said george diller a spokesman for the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
the telescope was transferred into the orbiter late thursday 
afternoon in an operation that took five hours 
once the bugs were behind us it really went about as 
smoothly as it could have gone thats the only thing thats been a 
surprise in any of this so far diller said 
discoverys five astronauts are to deploy the hubble on the 
second day of the fiveday mission once in orbit 370 miles above 
earth the telescope will be capable of looking seven times more 
deeply into space and detecting objects 50 times fainter than the 
best groundbased observatory 
the telescope is named for the late us astronomer edwin p 
hubble who discovered during the 1920s that the universe 
constantly is expanding his finding led to the bigbang theory 
that the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a 
terrific explosion 
the hubble will enable astronomers to study stars and galaxies 
so distant that their light has been traveling toward earth for 14 
billion years

president bush may be reluctant to recognize 
lithuanias new government but customers at a colorful stand in 
union stations main hall are eager to wave the flag 
theyre so eager that theres been a run on lithuanian flags 
patches key chains and lapel pins at alamo flags where manager 
dante paynes order book amounts to a weathervane of world events 
people will come by and say i heard about it on the news 
give me one they think freedom is great payne said 
in the past week payne has sold about 100 of his 4by6inch 
flags at 399 each and 25 of the demonstrationsize 3by5foot 
banners for 35 
i have to order at least twice a week payne said from his 
stand in washingtons elegantly renovated main train station you 
can see weve almost sold out of patches theres just one left 
patches sell for 4 for lithuania supporters who want to show 
the yellow green and red colors more discreetly key chains and 
lapel pins are priced at 399 each 
payne said many of his customers are americans with lithuanian 
roots others buy in bulk for demonstrations and the rest are 
mostly curious passersby 
dan raber a 17yearold high school student from kingsport 
tenn falls into another category the motivated collector 
i collect flags from different countries he said with 
all this going on and lithuania becoming a brandnew nation i 
thought it would be interesting to get a flag of theirs 
while he was at it raber picked up little flags from estonia 
and latvia in case lithuanias baltic neighbors follow it down the 
tricky path toward independence from the soviet union 
some other washingtonbased flag outlets reported no special 
increase in lithuanian flag sales 
i have had some calls i wouldnt say dozens by any means 
said diane wolter a saleswoman for betsy ross flag girls inc 
but she said political currents do affect the flag business 
since the berlin wall came down theres been a lot of 
interest in eastern europe she said when we had this 
flagburning thing that increased business tremendously 
the extra sales were to flag supporters she hastened to add 
not to people wanting to set the stars and stripes ablaze 
at union station payne said demand for the lithuanian flag has 
not matched the rush for czechoslovakian flags last november or for 
african national congress banners when nelson mandela was freed in 
south africa in february 
alamo flags boasts that it stocks flags from every country and 
all 50 states 
namibia is the only one we dont have because it just became a 
country payne said but we should have it by the end of the 
week

one semester away from graduation at mit and a 
commission in the navys prestigious nuclear propulsion program 
cadet robert bettiker looked across the desk at his superior 
officer and said im gay 
the officer rw sherer answered without hesitation 
well then we will consider the date of disenrollment he 
said 
that quickly the military career of a cadet with nearly four 
years of governmentfinanced education at the massachusetts 
institute of technology was finished a casualty of the pentagons 
policy of excluding homosexuals 
now bettikers case and another like his have drawn 
congressional attention a pentagon move to require bettiker and 
harvard cadet david carney to pay back their tuition drew a letter 
of protest from two dozen house members thursday 
we believe that to compel these men to repay this money would 
not only be fundamentally unfair it would also reflect an 
appalling meanspiritedness which has no place in the navy the 
lawmakers said in a letter drafted by rep gerry studds dmass 
an acknowledged homosexual 
the navy is showing no signs of wavering 
both carney and bettiker have been asked to sign onepage forms 
acknowledging their debt but have refused for carney that 
translates into a 50687 tab for bettiker the bill comes to 
38612 
carney 23 graduated from harvard last spring after the navy 
covered all his tuition and some fees he spent the past year 
studying at oxford university in england 
bettiker 22 is to graduate from mit this spring the navy 
stopped paying his tuition after the fall semester 
both men say they are balking at repaying the navy because they 
are not trying to avoid their five years of obligatory military 
service and want to become commissioned officers 
in my view the us navy broke its contract with me not vice 
versa carney said in an interview 
although bettiker and carney know one another and had the same 
commanding officer the similar timing of their cases was 
coincidental bettiker said both told their rotc superior that 
they had recently discovered their homosexuality they said they 
had not concealed their circumstances from the rotc and were not 
aware they were gay when they entered the service 
last month studds in a letter also signed by 23 congressmen 
complained about a similar policy move by the army rotc against 
james holobaugh 24 who attended washington university in st 
louis in the holobaugh case a preliminary board recommended he 
repay his tuition 
but in the carney and bettiker cases the lowerlevel board 
called for no repayment that recommendation was overruled by navy 
secretary h lawrence garrett iii who routinely reviews such cases 
navy spokesman jim turner declined to comment in detail on the 
carney and bettiker cases but provided a written explanation of the 
pentagons policy excluding homosexuals 
it said the defense department views homosexuality as 
incompatible with military service for reasons of morale 
chain of command discipline and security it indicated a concern 
about homosexual encounters among military personnel who must live 
and work close together and about the possibility that homosexual 
relationships could lead to breaches in security 
bettiker said that when he realized he was gay he inquired about 
the militarys exclusion of homosexuals but decided to report his 
situaion anyway 
i looked at the navys policy and was really angry that they 
could so arbitrarily decide that i was not fit for service 
bettiker said i thought about it and decided that i couldnt lie 
to them and couldnt live a lie for four to five years 
sherer in a telephone interview described his response to 
bettiker last nov 7 when bettiker reported his homosexuality i 
said i would have to disenroll him that that was a disqualifying 
factor for commissioning the navy officer said 
although sherer recommended that carney and bettiker not be 
forced to repay their tuition he called the loss of tuition one 
option thats standard for anybody who is disenrolled under 
similar circumstances 
neither cadet has retained an attorney but lambda legal defense 
and education fund in new york has taken an interest in the issue 
of gay men and lesbians in the military and is monitoring the navy 
rotc case 
im very optimistic that they wont have to pay back the 
money said sandy lowe a lambda attorney in none of these 
instances is there any finding at all that they defrauded the 
services

house democrats are tempting a presidential 
veto by rejecting the white house version of a childcare bill in 
favor of their own more costly and ambitious plan 
the house approved the measure estimated to cost at least 27 
billion over its first five years just hours after a spokesman for 
president bush issued a fresh veto threat thursday 
rather than waving his veto pen our president should match 
his warm words with good deeds and agree to sign our childcare 
bill house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said after 
the vote 
the bill still must go to a housesenate conference to resolve 
differences with the senate but democrats hoped the ultimate 
version would mirror the house bill and that electionyear 
pressures would make bush back down from his threat 
the house plan would expand tax credits for poor families to 
offset the cost of child care and would provide federal money for 
local governments to set up new daycare programs in public schools 
it would create a system of stateissued subsidy vouchers for 
parents who want to use religious daycare centers expand the head 
start program for poor children and establish minimum standards 
for daycare centers 
both parties embraced the cause of daycare assistance during 
the last presidential campaign and democrats were trying to seize 
the political advantage on the popular issue less than a week ago 
democrats reported being close to a bipartisan agreement on the 
issue in white house negotiations that ultimately collapsed 
i think president bush as he examines the bill will find a 
lot more to be comfortable with than not said a sponsor rep 
thomas downey dny 
i think it will go down as a landmark bill one of the great 
achievements of the congress and this era in american government 
said house speaker thomas foley dwash 
to offset part of the new childcare costs the house plan would 
take away the income tax credit that more affluent families now 
receive for child care that credit would be reduced for families 
earning 70000 a year and eliminated for those earning more than 
90000 
it also would make permanent the 3 percent telephone excise tax 
due to expire this year but both revenue sources would not cover 
the full cost 
the house approved the bill 265145 after voting more narrowly 
to reject the less costly alternative that bush had endorsed that 
versions fiveyear cost was put at nearly 20 billion 
the white houses budget office issued a statement calling the 
democratic version an exercise in fiscal irresponsibility 
just hours before the vote presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater warned that bush would veto the democratic version if it 
reached his desk 
the white house alternative was sponsored by reps charles 
stenholm dtexas and clay shaw rfla it was defeated on a 
225195 vote that largely followed party lines 
fourteen democratic governors and one republican gov john r 
mckernan jr of maine signed a letter to foley endorsing the 
democratic version of the childcare bill and opposing the 
conservative alternative 
republicans attacked the democratic version because it instructs 
states to set minimum standards for daycare centers including a 
requirement that daycare workers receive 15 hours of training a 
year 
the senates version passed last year would cost about the 
same as the version backed by bush though it would provide smaller 
tax credits like the house version the senate plan would provide 
vouchers for churchrun centers but it would place less emphasis 
on schoolbased programs 
sen chris dodd dconn sponsor of the senate version praised 
the house action as signaling a national child care policy is 
within reach 
though popular in the polls the issue of child care had been 
bogged down in the congress largely due to internal disputes 
among democrats the house last year approved conflicting 
childcare bills without resolving the differences 
if the childcare legislation were an actual child congress 
would be charged with abuse and neglect said rep olympia snowe 
rmaine

the soviet union may follow the lead of 
neighboring poland and begin a shock therapy plan to push the 
economy toward a market system a senior official says 
but vyacheslav senchagov chief of the state price committee 
also told deputies of the supreme soviet legislature that angry 
consumers could block such radical economic changes 
the government favors a moderate approach toward a market system 
that includes a transition period he said thursday in remarks 
carried by the official tass news agency 
however tass said senchagov acknowledged choosing the most 
radical approach is inevitable if during the transitional period 
the populations confidence in the government does not fall so 
low as to make no reforms possible 
the most radical of three alternatives being considered is 
likely to drastically raise prices for raw materials and consumer 
goods reduce the value of the ruble and raise unemployment he was 
quoted as saying 
senchagov said the government has not yet decided which approach 
it will try to put into effect 
after being installed in a powerful presidency on march 15 
mikhail s gorbachev said his most important task was to take more 
radical steps to cure the economy 
last week a source confirmed previous news reports that 
gorbachevs economists are working on a 17point program leading to 
a market system and convertibility of the soviet unions currency 
on world markets 
the source who is working on the program said soviet 
economists were encouraged by polands tough measures that went 
into effect on jan 1 but they were worried they might create huge 
unemployment and the need for a vast welfare program the source 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
many reports in moscow say radical economic changes will be put 
into effect this summer 
senchagovs bureaucracy sets prices without regard to costs 
creating artificially low prices for oil and gas and many natural 
resources as well as for food and basic consumer goods 
but the artificially low return for soviet industry stifles 
production and initiative 
subsidies to keep prices low now cost the government the 
equivalent of onefifth the total volume of the countrys retail 
trade senchagov reported 
consumers have become used to a system that offers a minimum of 
choice for low prices and many react with alarm to reports that 
the government is planning to free prices public concern has 
forced the government to delay key price reforms several times 
as a result of government management of prices one 
videocassette costs about twice as much as a 1200mile airline 
trip 
also the country has long told its people they have a right to 
a job but many enterprises lose money because of bloated payrolls 
polands prices have increased 1366 percent during the 12month 
period ending feb 28 the warsaw government says and more than 
200000 people are unemployed but under polands drastic economic 
plan inflation has dropped from 79 percent in january to an 
estimated 6 percent in march 
poland has restocked its store shelves while soviets see their 
stores becoming emptier and emptier 
the most conservative of the three approaches in moscow would 
raise some prices for raw materials and some manufactured goods by 
fixed amounts 
under the most radical approach however oil and coal prices 
will increase three to five times the number of collective and 
state farms known for their inefficiency will drop by 80 percent 
unprofitable enterprises will be closed and unemployment will 
increase fast tass quoted senchagov as saying

most of the allies are supportive but 
president bush is getting it from left and right here at home over 
his gentle approach to the soviet union on lithuania 
while the president has his congressional supporters most 
notably democratic house speaker thomas foley his critics are 
concerned that bushs refusal to confront soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev could undercut lithuanias chances of attaining 
independence 
the opportunity is unique lithuania and its sister republics of 
latvia and estonia were incorporated into the soviet union in 1940 
this is the first real chance they have had to get away 
by all indications bush and others in the administration are 
sympathetic they do not recognize the incorporation as being legal 
and they support independence in principle 
but they are not being very tough about it 
bush would sacrifice lithuania the conservative washington 
times said in a banner headline thursday after a congressional 
delegation had visited bush at the white house to complain about 
his policy 
nor is the consternation on capitol hill confined to republicans 
hes decided to stick with gorbachev said rep bill 
sarpalius dtexas part of the group that met with bush 
theres a genuine concern that the us faces a choice of 
political survival of gorbachev and survival of lithuania said 
richard durbin dill the delegation leader 
the criticism cuts across the political spectrum liberal and 
conservative columnists are hammering away at bush sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny called on the administration to challenge 
the soviet unions claim on lithuania in the international court of 
justice in the hague netherlands 
others are reluctant to criticize bush 
i dont criticize the president at this moment in recognizing 
that circumstances are very delicate very serious foley said 
i think he should be given the benefit of the doubt as he deals 
with this 
through it all the president and his spokesmen have not 
wavered though the weariness is beginning to show 
we no longer find it beneficial to comment on every daily 
episode and contribute to what was an upward spiraling of the 
rhetoric white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
we want to level off if you will 
from the start bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
have taken a consistent tack the soviets and the lithuanians 
should settle their differences peacefully if the kremlin applies 
force it could backfire 
this is the policy baker is conveying to moscow through 
diplomatic channels it is the same policy the administration is 
voicing in public 
critics find it too soft too solicitous of gorbachev too 
concerned that ussoviet relations could suffer if the 
administration put more starch into its public and private 
statements 
but bush and baker have concluded that a good relationship with 
moscow under gorbachev has produced dividends for the united 
states tensions have been reduced the soviets have agreed to pull 
tens of thousands of troops from europe along with tank divisions 
and other weapons 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will hold talks 
with baker at the state department next wednesday through friday in 
preparation for a bushgorbachev summit meeting in washington in 
june 
bush and baker clearly are banking on the proposition that they 
can maintain good relations without sacrificing lithuanian 
independence 
nobody denies their right of selfdetermination sergei 
chetverikov ministercounselor of the soviet embassy said tuesday 
and he told reporters the basic premise behind the actions 
of the soviet union is not to use force but to find peaceful 
ways 
the soviet diplomat an expert on constitutional law 
acknowledged however that the situation is difficult 
it is also difficult for bush and baker who have been accused 
in the past of taking too soft an approach to china after the 
suppression of prodemocracy forces last june for instance 
bush has wavered between a conservative and a moderate stance 
throughout his political career rightwing republicans savored his 
attack on liberals during the 1988 presidential campaign against 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts but they still are checking 
his credentials 
baker bushs guru during the campaign also is suspected of 
being too pragmatic of being inclined to put solutions ahead of 
ideology 
indeed there is a strong element of pragmatism in the policy 
the administration is pursuing on lithuania but it also may 
succeed without hurting either the lithuanians or ussoviet 
relations

israels military aid to the sovietbacked 
ethiopia government could prolong civil strife in that 
faminewracked country lawmakers and others say 
it really bothers me that israel would jeopardize its position 
in congress by supporting that butcher mengistu rep dan burton 
rind said thursday referring to ethiopias leader hile 
mengistu mariam 
burton along with other members of congress and the bush 
administration have long attacked mengistu for his human rights 
record and his policies that have contributed to thousands of 
starvation deaths over the last decade 
mengistus government is waging a civil war with rebels in 
eritrea and tigre two provinces in northern ethiopia 
israels aid to mengistu comes at a crucial time because the 
soviet union has yanked the many of its advisers from ethiopia and 
cut its military assistance according to one us official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
state department officials say they have told israel that the 
united states opposes the aid herman j cohen the assistant 
secretary of state for africa told the senate foreign relations 
committee this week that he took a very hard line on weapons 
shipments to ethiopia when he met with reuven marhav director 
general of the israeli foreign ministry 
israel has told the united states it is only providing small 
weapons such as rifles and a few advisers to ethiopia the state 
department says after a 20year lapse israel renewed diplomatic 
relations last year with ethiopia one of the few african countries 
with which it has official ties 
but burton said he thinks israeli military aid consists of more 
than simply rifles and is important because mengistu is in 
trouble he is starting to make overtures to the united states 
its a lastditch effort he said 
burton said he raised the issue of israels support for ethiopia 
in a recent meeting with israeli ambassador moshe arad he said he 
told the diplomat some members may use this issue as a wedge to 
curb support for aid to israel 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio also expressed grave concern 
about the israeli arms shipments said an aide who demanded 
anonymity metzenbaum confirmed the meeting but said his 
conversations were confidential 
gayle smith of the development group for alternative policies a 
nonprofit group that specializes in development issues said 
israeli intervention in the ethiopian civil war could turn the 
conflict into a broader war 
israel is supporting ethiopia and according to recent reports 
the saudis the iraqis and the libyans are backing mengistus 
opposition she said 
in particular israeli involvement is serving to enhance the 
effectiveness of the ethiopian air force which comprises the 
centerpiece of ethiopian military strategy smith told the 
foreign relations committee 
rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on africa said the ethiopian air forces mig 
jets continue to bomb convoys of food as they move into the 
faminestricken areas of eritrea and tigre wolpe has also 
expressed concern about israeli help for mengistu 
israel is backing the mengistu government for several reasons 
in part the israelis have said they are concerned for the welfare 
of about 15000 black jews live in ethiopia 
but smith said she believes the israelis are worried about the 
future of the horn of africa should the eritreans secede such a 
development would bring complete arab dominance of the red sea 
she said 
moreover ethiopia also allows israel overfly rights to south 
africa she said

sen robert c byrd said he wanted to be 
magnanimous in defeat after losing by a single vote a 500 million 
aid package for 5000 coal miners who may lose their jobs if 
congress passes a clean air bill 
but it remains to be seen just how forgiving the veteran west 
virginia democrat a key controller of the governments purse 
strings will be after his measure succumbed to the opposition of 
congressional leaders and president bush on thursday 
i know how hard it is to say no to the president of the united 
states byrd said with a touch of irritation after the 5049 
defeat ive said no to the expert lyndon johnson 
not since two years ago when byrd then his partys leader in 
the senate had a republican colleague arrested and physically 
carried to the senate floor to frustrate a filibuster had he put so 
much of his clout on the line 
that time the effort was on behalf of his party as part of 
failed drive to pass a campaign finance reform bill vigorously 
opposed by president reagan and republican lawmakers 
on thursday fighting back tears byrd conceded defeat again 
its pretty tough to have to be confronted with the 
administration and the joint leadership the 32year senate 
veteran told his colleagues but i knew that when i started out 
i have no regrets no recriminations 
as chairman of the senate appropriations committee that largely 
controls where tax dollars are spent byrd arguably is in a better 
position to take recriminations against colleagues than he was as 
majority leader 
that kind of power recognized and addressed by several 
lawmakers during two weeks of debate was not lost on byrds chief 
foes sen george mitchell the maine democrat who last year 
succeeded him as majority leader and gop leader bob dole of kansas 
mitchell who has viewed air pollution as a top legislative 
priority his his nine years in the senate had negotiated a 
compromise with dole and bush on a comprehensive cleanup package 
costing an estimated 21 billion a year 
mitchell argued repeatedly that the cost of byrds amendment 
would raise the price of the bill to a level unacceptable to the 
white house 
i dont have the influence the senator from west virginia has 
but i have a little dole said this could kill the bill 
the amendment would have paid special benefits to miners of 
highsulfur coal in the midwest and applachia whose jobs will be 
lost as utilities swith to lesspolluting coal mined in the west in 
order to meet the new laws requirements 
on the vote only 15 democrats sided with mitchell compared 
with the 37 who went with byrd dole kept 34 republicans in line 
with the administration but byrd got 11 gop votes 
byrds influence also was not lost on the interest groups 
lobbying behind the scenes despite urgings by mitchell to them to 
stay out of the fight both the aflcio and the national clean air 
coalition of environmental groups endorsed and actively lobbied for 
byrds amendment 
byrd actually was holding a 5047 edge going into the closing 
minutes of the vote sen spark matsunaga dhawaii a longtime 
ally of byrd arrived in a wheelchair after being absent for 
several weeks because of cancer treatments to vote for the 
amendment 
many of the senators who stayed on the fence until the vote 
occurred also side with byrd among them were democrats claiborne 
pell of rhode island and jeff bingaman of new mexico and 
republicans charles grassley of iowa and thad cochran of 
mississippi 
three who said they would vote with me changed byrd 
grumbled afterward they took wings with the help of people 
downtown at the white house 
one of the switchers was sen steve symms ridaho an opponent 
of most of the measures in the bill symms originally voted for 
byrds amendment but he switched after a twominute faceoff with 
dole and gop whip alan simpson of wyoming on the senate floor 
while the ayes and nos were being shouted simpson 
rushed up to sen joseph biden ddel and escorted him to the 
cloakroom to take a phone call from white house chief of staff john 
sununu 
he guaranteed me that the president was going to veto the bill 
if the amendment passed biden said explaining his vote 
against it if this were not a dealbuster if it would not kill 
this bill i would vote with byrd

as nicaraguas leftist government prepares to 
leave office us officials say there has been a marked increase 
in sandinista military shipments to rebel forces in el salvador 
the officials said thursday there has been a noticeable increase 
in the shipments mostly ammunition and explosives following the 
sandinsta defeat in the feb 25 elections 
according to the officials who asked not to be identified the 
managua government is sending vessels loaded with equipment to an 
area off el salvadors southeast coast 
the cargo is then loaded onto large canoes with 55horsepower 
engines which deliver the goods to a swampy area along the 
salvadoran coast the sources said 
the area is largely inaccessible to the salvadoran army because 
the fmln rebels have planted mines there 
the operations carried out under cover of darkness occur not 
daily but regularly said one official 
the sandinistas have systematically denied any role in 
supporting the salvadoran insurgency since 1981 the state 
department has maintained that the link between the two has been 
unbroken almost since the sandinistas came to power in 1979 
as us officials see it the link will become uncertain after 
april 25 when president daniel ortega is scheduled to turn power 
over to presidentelect violeta chamorro the fmln probably will 
have to shut down the command and control headquarters it has 
maintained in managua they said 
some rebel supplies have been sent from cuba via nicaragua but 
this source is not expected to be available to the rebels once the 
sandinistas are out of power the officials said 
us intelligence picked up evidence a few months ago that cuba 
had begun to ship weapons to the insurgents along a land route that 
begins in mexicos yucatan peninsula and runs through guatemala to 
el salvador the peninsula is only about 75 miles from cubas west 
coast 
mexico has denied that its territory has been used for 
transporting weaponry to the salvadorans 
there is some concern within the bush adminstration that the 
sandinistas who are wellarmed may try to find ways to continue 
supplying equipment to their salvadoran allies even after they 
surrender power 
still officials said that with the sandinista defeat the 
rebels are facing an unfavorable political and military situation 
they are more isolated politically than at any time since the 
insurgency began a decade ago and they used up many supplies in the 
offensive they launched in early november 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said that this 
combination of factors has improved prospects for a negotiated 
settlement to the salvadoran war which is believed to have claimed 
more than 70000 lives he is hopeful a peace agreement can be 
reached this year

and i came to the conclusion after studying it on my own that 
we had made a terrible mistake getting involved in the arms race 
of even greater concern turner said are world overpopulation

the navy has its most lethal ballistic missile 
at the ready with the first trident 2 missile deployed aboard the 
submarine uss tennessee 
this marks the start of an era said navy spokesman lt 
cmdr craig quigley this missile will serve as onethird of the 
nations strategic triad for many years to come 
a military source who declined to be identified said the vessel 
left its base at kings bay ga about 730 am est thursday 
the navy said in a statement that the trident 2 program has 
handled all of its tests successfully the service plans to build 
24 trident subs and purchase trident 2 or d5 missiles through 
fiscal year 2001 
greenpeace an environmental group that has tried to halt 
testing of the weapons system at sea said protestors aboard a 
60foot sailboat and three motorized inflatable rafts intercepted 
the tennessee and coast guard escort boats 13 miles off the 
atlantic coast on thursday 
josh handler a greenpeace spokesman said a coast guard boat 
boarded one of the rafts and cut its fuel line he said greenpeace 
activists aboard another raft rescued two coast guard crew members 
who were dumped overboard as their boat cut across the rafts bow 
the program encountered problems last year after two of its 
first three submarinelaunch tests ended in failure when the 
missiles selfdestructed it was declared on track in january after 
a 125 million repair of the missiles nozzle system 
however the navy statement said the program which has cost 35 
billion to date was delivered two years early and was 12 percent 
below the budget originally provided 
the program formally achieved what is called the initial 
operational capability meaning it is declared ready for use 
quigley said it marks the end of its landbased and 
submarinebased flight tests as well as all readiness checks for 
its missiles crew and equipment aboard the uss tennessee the 
statement said 
the first eight trident subs produced for the navy have gone to 
sea with the trident 1 missile which is less accurate than the new 
version the vessels are scheduled to be reequipped with trident 2 
missiles during the 1990s as they are brought in for overhauls 
quigley said the trident program could be hampered if the energy 
department is unable to resume production of warhead triggers by 
the end of june the triggers are made at the rocky flats plant 
near denver which has been closed since last november for safety 
improvements 
quigley said energy secretary james d watkins had informed the 
navy that it hoped to get rocky flats restarted by the end of june 
but that no firm date had been set 
if he doesnt meet that schedule then well have to 
reassess at that point the trident missile deployment schedule 
quigley said adding that watkins so far had given the navy no 
indication that it would be unable to meet its schedule

jewish organizations are calling rep gus 
savage a bigot for his attacks on a proisrael lobbying group but 
the black house member says the only racists are white 
savage dill held a news conference thursday insisting in 
advance on nonbelligerent questions he denied that his attacks 
on the americanisrael public affairs committee for supporting his 
opponent in a recent primary election were antisemitic and he 
declared racism is white there is no black racism 
aipac spokeswoman toby dershowitz said savages insertion of 
bigotry and antisemitism into the political arena is regretful and 
abhorrent the american jewish community has long prided itself on 
a high level of political involvement 
justin j finger associate national director of the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith said savages statements 
encourage hatred of jews and israel and are a reprehensible 
attempt to drive a wedge between blacks and jews 
savage called the mostly restrained news conference to show 
reporters and interested house members a videotape of his attacks 
on aipac during a march 17 primary campaign rally in chicago 
savage won the election 
at the rally savage said supporters of aipac the main 
proisrael lobbying group provided most of the financing last 
january and february for his defeated opponent mel reynolds 
savage insisted at the news conference there was nothing 
antisemitic in his statements he said he read a list of jewish 
contributors to reynolds during the rally simply to show their 
connection to aipac 
i was unaware i had been targeted by aipac i thought that was 
wrong savage said adding it was a disgrace that the lobby 
and contributors from outside the district had a major influence on 
reynolds 
he questioned whether a majority of jews support the proisrael 
lobby and declared he was one of the very few members willing 
to publicly oppose aipac 
also during the news conference savage called the academy 
awardwinning film driving miss daisy about an elderly white 
woman and her chauffeur an insult to blacks and made his 
oftrepeated statement that racist media were out to get him 
savages remarks have been closely followed since the house 
ethics committee last month found that he made improper 
advances to a female peace corps worker during a trip to zaire a 
year ago 
the panel said savage violated a house rule on members conduct 
but took no action to punish him citing a voluntary letter of 
apology to the woman 
savage said thursday that a network of socalled journalists 
was out to deliberately distort news about him and that the 
whitedominated media have tried to paint me as crazy crazy 
gus 
savage on occasion raised his voice to interrupt reporters who 
asked critical questions and gave lengthy speeches about racism in 
america 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said savages remarks 
about aipac at the rally in chicago created an impression of 
bigotry and can be legitimately construed as offensive 
foley said he has no control over savages comments we have 
standards for conduct unfortunately they dont require good sense 
or judgment always he said 
asked whether savage had exercised good judgment foley replied 
not on this issue certainly and i think it went beyond just a 
matter of bad judgment into language and statements that are 
can be legitimately construed as offensive

the decision by the veterans affairs 
department to award compensation to vietnam veterans suffering from 
one rare form of cancer doesnt resolve the dispute over exposure 
to agent orange 
the decision announced thursday could make it possible for the 
va to close the doors to compensation for a host of ailments linked 
to the herbicide used in vietnam from 1965 to 1970 to deny jungle 
cover to the enemy 
based on a study released the same day by the federal centers 
for disease control in atlanta va secretary edward j derwinski 
said he would award 100 percent disability payments to any vietnam 
veteran suffering from nonhodgkins lymphoma 
payments would be retroactive and widows and children would 
receive survivors benefits as well more than 1800 veterans or 
their survivors could receive compensation as a result according 
to va data at a cost of 23 million the first year and about 25 
million in subsequent years 
veterans advocates were pleased with the immediate decision but 
remained skeptical about the studys application to the larger 
agent orange questions the government has insisted there is no 
scientific proof of a link between the herbicide and a host of 
ailments mostly cancers 
when the study was designed cdc admitted that the study 
population was significantly diluted with unexposed veterans that 
it lacked a meaningful measure of exposure and that it lacked the 
statistical power to detect anything less than a 100 percent 
increase in certain cancers said sen thomas a daschle 
daschle dsd is cochairman of the vietnamera veterans in 
congress caucus and wrote legislation to make the disease and 
others suspected of having a link with agent orange exposure 
serviceconnected 
the cdc selected cancers study looked at the occurrence of 
cancer in all vietnam veterans in relation to men who did not serve 
in vietnam nonhodgkins lymphoma was the only cancer found in the 
study to have had an unusually high incidence 
derwinski was initially very careful to say his decision was not 
an agent orange decision but he and his aides were fuzzier in 
later remarks 
derwinski at one point said he made his determination based at 
least in part on the work of a vacommissioned panel of outside 
scientists that group reported last november that it could not 
find but neither could it rule out a statistically significant 
association between agent orange exposure and nonhodgkins 
lymphoma 
as a result of that finding derwinski had said he would 
postpone a decision on agent orange compensation until after the 
cdc study he had planned however to wait for the advisory 
panels recommendation in may 
derwinski jumped the gun thursday but he insisted the panel 
would continue its work on the agent orange issue derwinski is 
also consulting with elmo zumwalt the retired admiral who ordered 
agent orange spraying and whose son died of a cancer linked to 
exposure 
some 36000 agent orange claims have been made for the lymphoma 
and other ailments have been made and almost all have been 
rejected about 230000 veterans have asserted they have been 
exposed to agent orange 
the cdc study left some questions unresolved it noted for 
example that navy veterans were more inclined to get the disease 
even though they were least likely to have been exposed to agent 
orange it also said the lowest incidence was among veterans of iii 
corps the area of highest agent orange use 
john hanson an american legion official said the study 
neglected to point out that the iii corps area included saigon 
which wasnt sprayed 
deputy veterans secretary anthony j principi said va was making 
the presumption that any veteran who served in vietnam was exposed 
to agent orange but hanson said such a determination dilutes any 
statistical sample to the point where an agent orange determination 
is impossible

aids activists welcome president bushs 
attention to the epidemic that has ravaged the gay community and is 
spreading among drug users but they say he must match his 
sympathetic words with action 
compassion is important but we need money said tim 
mcfeeley of the human rights campaign fund 
in a speech thursday to the national leadership coalition on 
aids bush called on congress to pass the americans with 
disabilities act to bar discrimination against people with aids and 
those who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv which causes aids 
he also touted his administrations proposed fiscal 1991 budget 
proposal for spending 35 billion on aids treatment research and 
education 
but jean mcguire executive director of the aids action council 
said the sensitivity were seeing could mask the inaction weve 
had for the last decade under former president reagan 
if today is the beginning and not an end to the presidents 
efforts we can be hopeful she said but a decade of neglect 
requires a more aggressive and substantive and meaningful 
leadership than we heard today 
leaders of the national commission on aids were more positive in 
their reaction to the presidents first major speech on the 
disease which has taken the lives of more than 70000 americans 
most of them homosexuals or intravenous drug abusers they called 
bushs attention an important first step in escalating the public 
battle against the epidemic 
dr june osborn the commissions chairwoman said that even 
though the president offered no new initiatives it was important 
that he showed concern about the issue and compassion for people 
with aids 
in terms of changing the public mood we desperately need that 
rhetoric she said 
were on wartime footing at the national institutes of 
health and the centers for disease control in the battle against 
aids bush told the coalition of business labor health and 
religious groups 
but aids activists said the president was trying to inflate the 
administrations commitment to the aids battle by including among 
other things spending on medicaid and medicare patients who have 
aids that amounts to more than 1 billion of bushs total for aids 
spending 
aids activists attending the conference said that with just one 
speech bush has done more than reagan did for their cause 
but they were disappointed bush did not address some of the 
major issues relating to aids including an immigration policy that 
bars people with the fatal disease from entering the country 
many activists had hoped the president would address the 
immigration policy which has prompted dozens of organizations and 
agencies to boycott an international conference on aids planned for 
san francisco in june 
we have become an embarrassment in the global community that 
is dealing with this disease said mcguire of the human rights 
fund 
the administration has been granting waivers of the policy to 
people who enter the united states for conferences and to seek 
medical attention but pressure is building on the white house and 
congress to remove hiv infection from a list of contagious diseases 
that is grounds for barring people entry to the country 
robert haas chairman and chief executive officer of levi 
strauss amp co told the leadership coalition that bushs decision 
to address the group was of symbolic and historic importance 
but haas also criticized the president for proposing to 
eliminate funding for treatment of aids among lowincome people not 
eligible for medicaid he said bush also cut funding for home and 
communitybased care demonstration projects for aids patients and 
said the presidents budget for the war on drugs does not 
adequately support prevention and treatment of aids

the us senate cast a pall over 
thousands of coal miners by rejecting a 500 million compensation 
plan for those who could lose their jobs under a proposed clean air 
bill union officials say 
its a real tragedy said howard green international 
executive board representative for united mine workers district 17 
in charleston 
sen robert byrds amendment to the clean air act would have 
compensated the more than 5000 miners expected to lose their jobs 
over the next three years if the bill passes 
the measure would require coalfired power plants to severely 
cut emissions that likely would cause some utilities to switch 
from highsulfur coal to other fuels 
the senate rejected byrds amendment thursday on a 5049 vote 
let each senator ask himself the question is this fair 
said the west virginia democrat what about what the president 
has said about this being a kinder gentler nation does kinder and 
gentler stop at the edge of the coal fields 
the restrictions on highsulfur coal use could hit hard 
siphoning off coalmining jobs to areas with lowsulfur coal 
umw president richard trumka said the senate failed to 
recognize the devastating effect that this clean air legislation 
will have on the nations coal miners their families and their 
communities 
if the bill passes in its present state we anticipate losing 
2000 west virginia mining jobs said mike burdiss head of the 
unions coal miners political action committee in charleston 
umw officials said theyre not exactly sure what will happen now 
that byrds efforts to aid the miners have been rebuffed 
green predicted major displacement of miners as they go off 
in search of jobs 
were just going to have to wait and see theres a lot of ifs 
out there right now said eugene claypool president of umw 
district 31 in northern west virginia which has much of the 
states highsulfur coal where its going to occur and when its 
going to occur i dont know 
sens jay rockefeller dwva wendell ford dky and mitch 
mcconnell rky voted for byrds amendment sens charles robb 
dva and john warner rva voted against it 
kentucky and west virginia have more highsulfur coal reserves 
than virginia 
it was a tough blow to see the two senators from virginia 
voting against it green said they didnt look beyond their 
borders i just think those senators are insensitive to the coal

life expectancy in the united states has never 
been higher but disparities remain between whites and blacks 
federal researchers say 
overall us life expectancy rose to 75 years according to 1987 
data the centers for disease control reported thursday 
that was up 02 years about 73 days from 1986 said ken 
kochanek a statistician with the cdcs national center for health 
statistics in hyattsville md 
the lifeexpectancy concept means that someone born in 1987 
would live on the average 75 years women on average outlive 
men by 69 years 
overall americans can now expect to live about 12 years longer 
than they could expect 50 years ago the life expectancy rate in 
1940 was 629 
but while average life expectancy for whites was 756 years up 
slightly from 1986 life expectancy for blacks was 694 years 
same as the year before 
and though the nations mortality rate was down annual black 
death rates were 50 percent higher than for whites 7786 per 
100000 blacks compared with 5111 for whites 
the greatest single disparity in death rates was for death by 
homicide the black homicide rate in 1987 was six times higher than 
that for whites the cdc reported 
meanwhile the nations overall mortality rate in 1987 the 
latest year for which analysis is available fell to a record low 
of 5355 deaths for every 100000 americans thats down 1 percent 
from a year earlier and down 7 percent from 1979 
a total of 2123323 us deaths were reported in 1987 the 
highest number ever as the nations population has grown 
the decline in the overall death rate came as fatality rates 
dropped for 13 of the previous years 15 leading causes of death 
including the big four heart disease cancer stroke and 
accidental injuries 
the death rate from heart disease the nations leading killer 
dropped 31 percent the rate for cancer declined 02 percent the 
rate for stroke and cerebrovascular disease fell 23 percent and 
the rate for accidents dropped 17 percent 
among the 15 leading causes of death the only increases were 
among diabetes up 21 percent and septicemia or blood 
infections up 47 percent 
yearbyyear comparisons were unavailable for aids deaths 
because of 1987 changes in categorization in the mortality study 
the cdc said 
but cdc data on aids found a 32 percent increase in deaths 
between 1986 and 1987 and mortality from aids appears to be 
increasing more rapidly than mortality from other conditions the 
atlantabased agency said 
acquired immune deficiency sydrome replaced birth defects as the 
15th leading cause of death

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee is calling for ussoviet reviews of failsafe systems 
because of concerns that unrest in the baltic republics could put 
nuclear weapons in the wrong hands 
sen sam nunn dga suggested thursday that the bush 
administration urge the soviet union to join the united states in 
conducting separate but parallel studies of nuclear control 
programs 
if nationalists or terrorists overran a soviet nuclear storage 
site in one of the republics would the superpowers coordinate 
their actions nunn said in a senate floor speech 
have we thought through the problem of how we would respond to 
nuclear blackmail 
nunn suggested using the existing nuclear risk reductions 
centers for talks about how the two superpowers could avoid an 
inadvertent nuclear war 
ethnic unrest in azerbaijan and lithuanias declaration of 
independence march 11 have prompted moscow to resort to military 
force 
nunn also acknowledged the lessening soviet conventional threat 
and questioned whether the administration is correctly 
characterizing the soviets modernization of their strategic forces 
defense secretary dick cheney has said unequivocally that there 
has been no reduction in soviet strategic forces and the only 
change has been in improving their forces 
the administration has tended to overstate its case nunn 
said 
he said us intelligence has found a decrease in the soviets 
blackjack bomber production in addition the soviets have ceased 
patrolling us coasts with its yankeeclass submarines and 
patrolling north of canada with its nucleararmed bearh bomber 
nunn also discussed his complaints in a speech last week that 
the administrations fiscal 1991 defense budget has several major 
blanks that congress will fill if the pentagon doesnt 
cheney in a speech shortly after nunns address last week 
disputed some of the chairmans claims and said the defense 
department is recognizing rapid changes in eastern europe in 
fashioning a spending plan for fiscal 1992 to 1997 
it is crucial to note however that secretary cheney made no 
claim that the administrations fiscal 1991 budget request reflects 
all these assumptions nunn said thursday as he urged the 
pentagon chief to fill in the blanks quickly 
questioned about nunns comments pentagon spokesman pete 
williams said it would be very difficult if not dare one say 
imprudent to send up a 91 budget on the basis of things that 
havent happened yet as events change we will adjust our plans 
accordingly

critics of a 4yearold immigration law are 
pushing to repeal its penalties against employers who hire illegal 
aliens citing a report that blames the law for widespread hiring 
discrimination 
unless congress finds a way to end this discrimination the 
sanctions must be repealed sen edward m kennedy dmass said 
thursday after the general accounting office issued its report on 
the immigration law 
however immigration and naturalization service commissioner 
gene mcnary said the gao report was soft and sen alan 
simpson rwyo said the facts did not justify the agencys 
findings of widespread discrimination 
today i learned a whole new definition of the word 
widespread said simpson who has played a major role in writing 
immigration laws 
the law designed to curb the flow of illegals over the southern 
border in search of highpaying jobs calls for civil and criminal 
penalties against those who employ ineligible workers 
critics predicted when the measure was passed by congress in 
1986 that it would cause employers to discriminate against 
foreignlooking applicants 
the gaos report said the law is not an unnecessary burden on 
employers it concluded that the measure has not caused frivolous 
complaints against employers and has apparently reduced illegal 
immigration 
ins figures show that 383375 illegals were apprehended on the 
southern border from october 1987 through february 1988 compared 
with 267174 in the same period a year later in the comparable 
period ending last month apprehensions increased to 366844 
the ins mcnary told a news conference the number of 
apprehensions would have doubled had it not been for the 1986 
immigration law and the gao report cited a study by the urban 
institute that found a slowing of illegal immigration 
the gao said many employers discriminated because the laws 
verification system does not provide a simple or reliable method to 
verify job applicants eligibility to work 
it said up to 10 percent of the 46 million employers considered 
under the gao survey may be practicing job bias based on national 
origins because of confusion over the immigration law 
discrimination related to the law is serious but not 
pervasive the 162page report said it said hiring bias might be 
reduced by more information for employers and a simpler and more 
reliable system for verifying work eligibility 
under the law employers must complete an eligibility form for 
each newly hired worker it allows the employees to establish their 
eligibility by presenting any one of 17 documents such as a us 
passport birth certificate or alien registration card 
in response to the report the us commission on civil rights 
urged congress to repeal the laws penalty provisions saying 
evidence has been building rapidly in recent months that employer 
sanctions cause serious employment discrimination 
this discrimination is unacceptable and its root cause 
employer sanctions should be eliminated the independent 
factfinding agency said in a statement 
the ins mcnary told reporters that some of the gaos 
conclusions were soft because there is no base of comparison in 
the past he also pointed to a statement in the document that 
said some interpreters might not agree with the findings 
they own up to the fact that others may disagree and for good 
reason he said

scientists who analyzed 10 years of weather 
satellite data found no evidence that the earth has warmed from the 
socalled greenhouse effect 
in a paper published today in the journal science the 
scientists reported that the tirosn series of weather satellites 
accurately measured the earths temperature from 1979 through 1988 
and found no evidence of climate change 
we found that the earths atmosphere goes through fairly large 
yeartoyear changes in temperature and over that 10year period we 
saw no longterm warming or cooling trend roy w spencer of the 
marshall space flight center in huntsville ala said at a news 
conference thursday 
he said the data did prove however that satellites can be used 
to measure the earths temperature with a more global perspective 
than the limited groundbased instruments now in use 
spencers fellow investigator john r christy of the university 
of alabama said there were temperature swings that can be quite 
dramatic during the decade that was studied but that on a global 
basis the thermal changes tended to even out 
the northern hemisphere goes up slightly during those 10 years 
and the southern hemisphere goes down slightly said christy 
the net effect for the globe is basically zero 
detecting a climate trend the scientists said will take at 
least another decade of satellite measurements 
there is no guarantee that if you take a 10year segment out 
of a long time that youll get the overall trend said christy 
the data cannot be used to say weve got an enhanced greenhouse 
effect 
christy said the findings are enough to tantalize us but 
this is just a start and satellite measurements are continuing 
the tiros satellite data is the first to add global temperature 
data to the scientific debate about the greenhouse effect spencer 
said most other studies of temperature trends some extending over 
more than a century have come from the records of groundbased 
thermometers 
these readings christy said do not reflect the global 
temperature because there are very few temperature measurements for 
vast areas of the earths oceans 
some experts believe the earth is beginning to warm as a result 
of carbon dioxide and other gases dumped into the atmosphere over 
the last 150 years this warming called the enhanced greenhouse 
effect is a matter of controversy in the scientific community 
because of the difficulty in measuring small climate trends over a 
long period 
eric j barron director of the earth system science center at 
pennsylvania state said the analysis of the tiros data by spencer 
and christy could be extremely valuable in the global warming 
debate but he agreed that 10 years is too short a period to detect 
a climate trend 
what is important about the study barron said is that it 
proves satellite studies eventually may be able to settle the 
controversy 
science which published the study today is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

opponents of a planned exhibit of photographs 
by the late robert mapplethorpe say most of the pictures are 
innocuous even beautiful but that nine of the sexually explicit 
photos are unacceptable for cincinnati 
those photographs from the 175photo exhibit scheduled to open 
next week at the contemporary arts center depict sadomasochistic or 
homoerotic sex acts or feature nude children say members of 
citizens for community values 
were saying we want you to exercise your responsibility and 
delete the roughest images tom grossmann a lawyer for the group 
told a news conference thursday 
there is no doubt that mapplethorpe has created some 
photographs that are art but his homosexual material speaks so 
loudly that i stand here with the group said the rev freddie t 
piphus 
in the face of strong public opposition the center filed a 
lawsuit seeking a court ruling on whether the photographs are 
obscene last june the exhibit was cancelled at the corcoran 
gallery of art in washington dc 
police and the hamilton county sheriff have said they are 
considering filing obscenity charges if the museum displays the 
photographs 
arts center director dennis barrie was loudly applauded thursday 
at the annual convention of the ohio museums association when he 
said opposition and legal challenges to exhibits such as the 
mapplethorpe show was a threat to the future of art museums 
this is a museum that has had to go to court i think 
thats a very sad state of affairs barrie said i think its 
time you stood up to that challenge your whole world is at stake 
in washington the head of the national endowment for the arts 
said thursday he favored the arts centers decision to seek a court 
ruling 
in my view this is precisely the forum in which this issue 
should be determined because obscenity is a local issue and they 
will make their decision based on community standards john e 
frohnmayer said at a capitol hill hearing and later at a national 
press club luncheon 
to quell opposition to the exhibit the museum plans to post a 
warning sign and bar unaccompanied minors while the shows runs 
april 6 to may 25 
theyre trying to deflect the issue by posting a warning 
said monty lobb jr director of citizens for community values who 
denied that opponents are trying to force the museum into 
selfcensorship 
were even going beyond the first amendment or anything of 
that nature were going to the dignity of human life lobb said 
he said he wanted the center to demonstrate civic 
responsibility and be sensitive to the community 
henry dorfman publisher of the weekly greater cincinnati 
business record said two photographs showing nude or partially 
nude children might encourage child pornography 
if in our art museums we freely display and tacitly advocate 
this kind of abuse of children we are in serious trouble 
dorfman said

president bush traded quips with amateur and 
professional comedians at a broadcasters banquet but he said he 
didnt show up until the secret service swept the ballroom 
the place was clean no broccoli bush told the crowd of 
more than 2000 people at the annual radio and television 
correspondents association dinner thursday night 
with his sirloin and salmon bush also had to digest a ribbing 
at the hands of both broadcasters and impressionist jim morris 
cbs reporter linda taira president of the association got in 
several digs in her introduction 
its exciting for our print colleagues mr president to 
cover you they bump against their deadlines trying to punctuate 
your sentences she said when my desk calls me in the middle 
of the night i never know whether youve invaded another country 
or banned another vegetable 
she advised bush to never ever take a phone call from 
hashemi rafsanjani unless you get caller id in the oval office 
the president said he was glad to be with all the big names in 
the electronic media despite the hard time they gave him on the 
recent hoax phone call from a prankster posing as the iranian 
president 
today i got him back called him up and asked if he had prince 
abdul in a can bush quipped but then i forgot how to say 
let him out in farsi 
bush mocked his own disjointed speaking style which morris and 
other comics love to imitate saying ill be honest hes good 
too good thats as far as ill go not going to comment not going 
to criticize jim morris at this juncture wouldnt be prudent 
bush and his wife barbara laughed along with most of the jokes 
told by morris and talk show host larry king who served as emcee 
morris fielding questions as if he were president was asked 
why he had named the panama invasion operation just cause the 
mockbush answered just cuz 
hey its central america its america its ours said 
morris 
morris who also performed at a gala for fords theatre that the 
bushes attended sunday quipped that the best thing we can do to 
reduce the deficit is see if we can convince the japanese to 
produce 30 percent of their goods in a shoddy fashion 
morris scored one joke at the expense of a bush critic the 
house majority leader saying dick gephardt is a perfect example 
of where we have failed in our public schools

the uneducated and poor still face the greatest 
threat from heart disease although people of all social classes 
have reduced their risk equally in recent years a study suggests 
university of minnesota epidemiologist wayne rosamond who 
coauthored the study presented the findings thursday during the 
american heart associations annual conference on heart disease 
epidemiology the study of disease among population groups 
the results indicate lower socioeconomic classes obviously 
have not caught up with the relative advantages of being more 
educated and more affluent said dr elizabeth barrettconnor a 
university of california san diego researcher and chairwoman of 
the associations epidemiology council 
the minnesota researchers examined heart disease risk factors 
and socioeconomic status as reflected by education and family 
income levels of 3816 randomly selected adults in the 
minneapolisst paul area in 198082 and of another 4641 in 
198587 
although people got slightly fatter during the study period 
those in each socioeconomic group also made statistically 
equivalent reductions in blood cholesterol blood pressure and 
cigarette smoking major factors in heart disease 
but the difference between the highly educated and less 
educated is not narrowing at all said dr russell luepker chief 
author of the study and a professor of epidemiology and medicine at 
minnesota 
lower socioeconomic groups still have the highest levels of 
blood pressure blood cholesterol cigarette smoking and obesity 
he said 
if were going to continue to make progress we have to target 
those groups who have been least affected by improvements in 
society he said those with lower income have higher risk and 
also are the least educated they are not making the higher level 
of progress you would hope for 
the study found for example that the proportion of men who 
smoked fell from 44 percent to 41 percent among those who didnt 
finish high school dropped from 40 percent to 33 percent among 
those with some college and declined from 25 percent to 21 percent 
among men who graduated college 
another example the proportion of women with at least one risk 
factor for heart disease fell from 65 percent to 54 percent among 
those who didnt finish high school declined from 57 percent to 46 
percent among those with some college and dropped from 43 percent 
to 34 percent among those who got a college degree 
while the study found an increased risk of heart disease was 
related to both low education and low family income the link with 
low education was stronger rosamond said 
more educated people are taking better care of themselves and 
have less risk because of it luepker said theyre the people 
who are exercising quitting smoking and eating healthier diets 
the only exception to the link between disease risk and social 
status was that men in higher classes tended to have higher 
cholesterol levels that men in lower classes rosamond said

a leading republican opponent of the b2 
bomber says a new estimate that the program will cost 767 billion 
provides additional ammunition for the battle against the stealth 
aircraft 
when the program cost 70 billion members said they couldnt 
believe it now its 65 billion more clearly it bolsters our 
case dramatically said rep john kasich rohio a member of the 
house armed services committee 
the congressional budget office in a letter to kasich 
increased its cost estimates for the b2 based on inflation 
predictions and the air forces planned modifications to the plane 
cbo estimates that the administrations program for the b2 
bomber would cost about 767 billion based on the best information 
we have the office said in the letter 
the pentagon has said purchasing the fleet of 132 bombers will 
cost 702 billion recently air force secretary donald rice said 
the program may cost about 75 billion 
kasich who requested the information from the cbo has 
introduced legislation that would limit the b2 purchase to the 15 
planes already in production 
in the letter the cbo agreed with a recent report by the 
general accounting office the investigative arm of congress that 
the cost of the program could exceed its estimates 
costs of new programs at the leading edge of technology are 
always hard to estimate the cbo said furthermore there are 
special estimating problems unique to the b2 program 
the cbo warned that the administration may not realize the 
savings it expects to gain from purchasing the radarevading planes 
over a period of years the office also agreed with officials at 
the general accounting office who said the bombers cost will 
increase due to the strike at the boeing corp a major 
subcontractor and that future tests may expose costly problems

the food and drug administration is hoping for a 
consensus among health experts and food companies on how to make 
sure consumers striving for health and fitness arent fooled by 
product labels and advertising 
executives from some of the countrys largest food corporations 
met thursday with federal officials at a conference prompted by fda 
proposals to tighten regulation of food health claims 
were trying to define boundaries so consumers can believe 
whats on that label said fred shank the agencys director for 
food safety and applied nutrition 
at the heart of the debate a conflict over what diet and health 
messages should be allowed on food packaging and who should set the 
standards 
its clear that the current situation must change otherwise 
the bad messages may drive out the good said frank young deputy 
secretary for the department of health and human services 
the fda hoped for agreement with the food industry national 
health experts and other policy makers by todays wrapup of the 
tufts universitysponsored conference the fda plans to institute 
new regulations by years end 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan announced the 
proposed regulations last month calling them a midcourse 
correction of rules that have allowed food sellers to make health 
claims since 1987 when the reagan administration abandoned a 
longstanding prohibition against such claims 
the proposal generally would let companies make certain health 
claims that are backed up by studies by the surgeon general and the 
national academy of sciences other claims would be allowed only in 
certain circumstances 
the policy would allow health claims about fiber and colon 
cancer fiber and heart disease fats and cancer fats and heart 
disease sodium and high blood pressure and calcium and 
osteoporosis a softening of the bones found in the elderly 
many food company executives at the conference here said they 
have no major quarrel with more stringent fda regulations but 
almost all voiced concern that the fda has failed to propose 
uniform national standards they said they fear that allowing 
states to set some of the standards may lead to trade barriers 
between states 
there are shortcomings but we know theres an immense 
interest on the part of the public for information and were glad 
to see some movement on that end said luther c mckinney a 
senior vice president of the quaker oats co which found itself 
caught in the debate over the cholesterollowering powers of oat 
bran 
we simply want to argue strongly for federal uniformity if 
were going to have a meaningful national market we cant deal 
with 50 different regulations

the food and drug administration is recalling 
two lots of an antidepressant drug called desipramine because some 
bottles may contain a bloodthinner that could cause serious 
bleeding officials say 
the manufacturer pharmaceutical basics inc of denver told the 
fda it was calling back the products after distributor hl moore 
of new britain conn found a mislabeled bottle of the drug 
earlier this week 
the bottle was labeled as containing 25 milligrams of 
desipramine but it actually contained 5 milligram tablets of 
warfarin a bloodthinner 
the fda said people taking the antidepressant should examine 
their tablets to see if any are marked with the name warfarin 
warfarin is a noncoated pink tablet with 5 on one side and 
832 and the word warfarin on the other side 
desipramine is a coated lavender tablet with the numbers 
832 and g254 imprinted on it 
pharmaceutical basics is notifying moores 350 customers by 
phone of the possible label mixup the fda said thursday 
the recall applies only to desipramine made by pharmaceutical 
basics for distribution by moore about six other manufacturers

a proposed bill would teach parents prenatal 
care and ways to develop their babies coordination memory 
language and social skills 
we know that parental involvement in the education of their 
children is the key to longterm gains for youngsters sen 
christopher bond rmo said thursday parents are their childs 
first and most influential teachers 
bond was joined in introducing the bill by sen thad cochran 
rmiss and sen howell heflin dala 
the bill would create a national parents as teachers program 
based on a missouri model a fiveyear 100 million competitive 
grant program would be set up for states to begin or expand parents 
as teachers 
the program which operates in 26 states employs home visits 
group meetings videotapes and written material to teach new and 
prospective parents the skills of raising an infant there also are 
periodic health screenings of children 
bond said the average operating cost for a parents as teachers 
program in a school district is about 20000 per year he 
estimated that about 1000 school districts nationwide could 
participate in the program annually with federal assistance 
the bill would force states to eventually pick up the cost of 
the program as federal funding would decline to 75 percent in the 
third year 50 percent in the fourth year and 25 percent in the 
fifth year of the fiveyear authorization

a government report says no one has been 
properly overseeing maintenance of the alaskan oil pipeline to 
prevent a land spill as disastrous as the ocean spill in prince 
william sound 
but since the exxon valdez ran aground and dumped nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil into the pacific ocean off alaska last 
year the appropriate agencies are taking notice said the study 
released thursday by the general accounting office 
people should remain skeptical said rep george miller 
dcalif chairman of the house interior subcommittee on offshore 
energy resources 
miller has been leading a congressional investigation of the 
march 24 1989 spill and the safety of other oil industry 
operations in alaska 
the regulators and the regulated have been too cozy he said 
of the relationship between the government and the oil industry 
he said its too early to tell if significant improvement has 
been made but various studies under way by the government and the 
criminal case against exxon for the spill should lead to 
improvements 
the gao said that while several federal and state agencies have 
authority over the transalaska pipeline system the pipeline has 
not received the systematic comprehensive oversight needed to 
ensure compliance with operational safety emergency response and 
environmental requirements 
thats particularly worrisome because of recent news that the 
pipeline is corroding james duffus director of the gaos division 
on natural resources management told millers subcommittee

most of the usbacked contra 
rebels in honduran camps are returning to nicaragua without waiting 
for a un team that is supposed to monitor their disbanding a 
rebel leader says 
oscar sovalbarro a military chief of the nicaraguan resistance 
the rebels umbrella group said thursday that most rebels left the 
camps taking their weapons and would reach nicaragua by the end 
of this week 
in our camps in yamales there are few weapons and few 
combatants left sovalbarro said referring to an area 125 miles 
southwest of tegucigalpa that had been used by an estimated 12000 
rebels in their nineyear war against nicaraguas sandinista 
government 
he said only about 3000 warwounded and their families remain 
in the camps in yamales which became home to the bulk of the 
rebel force after us military aid to the contras ended in 1988 
un forces of about 200 were gathering in managua and 
tegucigalpa to monitor nicaraguas transition from a decadeold 
leftist revolutionary government to the conservative united 
national opposition 
in an accord with representatives of nicaraguan presidentelect 
violeta barrios de chamorro sovalbarro agreed the rebels in 
honduran camps would disband and hand over their weapons by april 
20 five days before the new administration takes over from the 
sandinistas 
rebels in nicaragua are to gather in unsupervised security 
zones under the accord but there is no deadline for their 
demobilization 
but sovalbarro 29 said thursday most rebels returned to 
nicaragua without waiting to hand in their guns to un forces the 
contra leader known as commander ruben signed the agreement march 
23 with the incoming government 
we want to turn in our rifles in nicaragua because if there 
is going to be democracy in our country then we will exchange our 
weapons for the plow to cultivate the land sovalbarro said 
it was unclear whether the rebels rankandfile would honor the 
accord 
meanwhile us ambassador chris arcos praised honduran 
president rafael leonardo callejas for his role in persuading the 
rebels to leave honduras 
the contras have been dissolved and callejas resolved that 
problem arcos said 
callejas sponsored the negotiations in which nicaraguan 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo archbishop of managua also 
participated they followed the sandinistas loss in elections feb 
25 to mrs chamorros usbacked coalition 
an estimated 80000 hondurans were displaced by the rebels 
including 20000 coffee producers they were forced to move to the 
interior of the country or traveled illegally to the united states 
or mexico to find work

iraqs drive to eclipse israel as the 
middle easts paramount military power is gathering momentum and 
its alleged attempt to acquire trigger devices for nuclear weapons 
underlines that the regional arms race has reached a new stage 
most analysts believe iraq is still years away from producing a 
nuclear weapon but coupled with development of longrange 
missiles and chemical weapons iraqi efforts to acquire the trigger 
devices have raised concern that its nuclear program may be more 
advanced than anyone thought 
the sophisticated devices are believed to be available only to a 
few major powers 
the state department called in iraqs ambassador in washington 
mohamed almashat on thursday and registered deep concern that 
iraq is trying to circumvent us restrictions on nuclear 
technology shipments the department also reportedly reiterated 
us opposition to the spread of missile technology in the middle 
east 
the arrest of three people in london on wednesday on accusations 
they were trying to smuggle the triggers to iraq was among the 
latest in a chain of indicators that iraq is capable of developing 
hightechnology weapons 
in december iraq surprised other nations by launching a rocket 
it said could be used to put a satellite into space it also claims 
to have developed missiles with a range of 750 miles 
both incidents demonstrated the advances the iraqis have made 
the new york times reported today that iraq for the first time 
is building missile launchers within range of israel and the syrian 
capital of damascus the newspaper quoting unidenfied us 
intelligence officials said they believed the missiles in western 
iraq are intended to discourage possible israeli attack on iraqi 
nuclear or chemical weapons facilities 
western intelligence sources said the rocket launch was less 
successful than at first believed they said the rocket flew for 
just over two minutes reaching an altitude of 12 miles before 
plunging back to earth 
nonetheless some analysts believed it put iraq on the threshold 
of ballistic missile capability 
richard murphy former us assistant secretary of state and a 
middle east expert told a conference on iraq in london this month 
that iraqs missile program has made extraordinary progress 
he noted this progress generally carries an ominous overtone 
and not just in the united states its genuine scientific 
achievements are clouded by associated reports of iraqi progress in 
chemical weapons and biological warfare research 
iraq has achieved this despite the efforts of the united states 
and the six industrialized nations to halt the flow of sensitive 
technology to stem the proliferation of missiles 
there is some evidence the missile technology control regime is 
having some effect but murphy noted the problem is getting out 
of the control if it hasnt already of the superpowers its 
difficult to attract middle eastern countries into the regime 
the superpowers influence in restricting access to missile 
technology has been undercut by the emergence of sophisticated arms 
industries in latin america asia and the middle east 
china has supplied weapons to iran and iraq but says it has 
stopped doing so iran syria saudi arabia and libya are also 
developing or believed to be developing missiles 
israel faced with the erosion of its technological superiority 
now has the nuclearcapable jericho1 weapon with an estimated 
range of up to 370 miles 
it recently tested an advanced version jerichoii with a 
reputed range of more than 1000 miles enough to hit targets 
anywhere in the region and even reach the soviet union 
iraqi officials deny baghdad is seeking to build nuclear 
weapons but the rapid strides it has made in military technology 
along with president saddam husseins regional ambitions and the 
lack of a formal peace treaty with iran have caused widespread 
concern 
iraq is being unnecessarily grandiose in its military 
preparations simon henderson editor of the londonbased mideast 
markets newsletter told the london conference 
western officials consider the amount it spends on defense to 
be totally out of proportion to that necessary to meet any threat 
of renewed hostilities with iran 
instead they foresee that by the end of the decade iraq will 
have the largest arsenal in the region of unconventional weapons 
principally mediumrange missiles with sophisticated warheads 
including chemical and nuclear weapons 
in december mideast markets reported that iraq was trying to 
build a nuclear bomb with chinese help 
the newsletter said the chinese had provided baghdad with 
components for highspeed centrifuges that produce the highly 
enriched uranium needed for nuclear weapons 
it said it could be 10 years before iraq would be capable of 
testing such a weapon but israeli officials have said iraq is 
probably much closer than that 
israeli warplanes bombed a frenchbuilt nuclear reactor near 
baghdad in june 1981 alleging the iraqis were developing nuclear 
weapons 
some analysts believe baghdads effort to get its hands on 
nuclear triggers indicates it is well down the road to nuclear 
weapon capability 
but don kerr a military specialist with the londonbased 
international institute for strategic studies said in a telephone 
interview that he believed iraqs nuclear program is still 
essentially in the theoretical stage because of the problems of 
getting hold of weaponsgrade material 
he said iraqs bid to acquire nuclear triggers was an attempt 
to take a short cut through the design and development process 
at present israel is believed to be the only nuclear power in 
the middle east 
israel denies that but nuclear technician mordechai vanunu 
imprisoned for revealing israels nuclear secrets to a london 
newspaper said israel has at least 100 nuclear weapons 
the minister in charge of iraqs rapidly expanding military 
industries gen hussein kamel was quoted by a persian gulf 
newspaper last year as saying iraq was negotiating with the french 
to rebuild the bombed reactor for peaceful purposes 
the french iraqs secondbiggest arms supplier after the soviet 
union denied that 
however king fahd of saudi arabia said last year his country 
was ready to help the iraqis rebuild the reactor 
the soviets too have been closely associated with iraqs 
nuclear program and in 1984 agreed to provide 2 billion in credit 
to help build two nuclear power stations

lawmakers have approved a new way to 
finance and run kentuckys public schools abolishing a system the 
state supreme court said shortchanged poor districts and dragged 
down test scores 
the house voted 5842 thursday to approve the overhaul which 
includes a 126 billion tax increase and decentralization of 
control over daytoday operation of the 570000student system 
and sent it to gov wallace wilkinson the senate passed the 
measure 308 on wednesday 
the governor has hailed the plan as history in the making 
its the first time that any state has scrapped its existing 
system and started over again said frank newman president of 
the education commission of the states a federally supported 
research organization 
courts in 10 states have overturned education funding systems 
since 1970 because of disparities in money available for rich and 
poor districts but education experts said last years ruling in 
kentucky was perhaps the most sweeping 
the court declared the entire school system unconstitutional 
because its quality varied so greatly between rich and poor 
districts the court also found that kentucky students were 
performing in the lowest quarter nationally on standardized tests 
student performance is fraught with inequalities and 
inequities throughout the 178 local school districts chief 
justice robert stephens wrote 
the legislature responded by repealing and replacing all 
kentucky laws on elementary and secondary education the 900page 
legislation would mean more money for schools in general and 
dramatically more money for poor districts about half the money 
from the tax increase would be spent on schools 
were going to do innovative things in kentucky for once 
said rep greg stumbo the democratic majority floor leader 
were not going to be a follower anymore were going to be a 
leader 
as in many states school spending in kentucky is based 
primarily on local property taxes and varies according to property 
values under the current system spending ranges from 1800 to 
4200 a year per student depending on the district 
under the new plan the minimum property tax would increase and 
the state would establish a minimum spending level of 2900 per 
student in the 199091 school year making up the difference if a 
district could not raise enough money 
overall state financing for elementary and secondary education 
would increase from 15 billion this year to 19 billion next 
year 
the state education departments role would be overhauled 
districts would gain control over curriculum and other daytoday 
operations while the state would manage a system of rewards 
including cash for employees of schools that improve each year 
under the bill the state also can quickly take over school 
systems that fail to measure up the bill doesnt spell out how the 
state would measure progress 
the plan also calls for a largescale investment in technology 
emphasis on early childhood education and extra help for potential 
dropouts 
control of the system also would be shifted from an elected 
state superintendent to an appointed education commissioner 
rep roger noe chairman of the house education committee said 
he considered the bill second only to brown vs board of education 
in the making of education law the 1954 us supreme court 
decision outlawed school segregation 
lawmakers in texas also are considering education finance reform 
after that states top court rejected the states funding mechanism 
other states where courts overturned school finance systems 
according to a study last year by robert berne associate dean of 
new york universitys graduate school of public administration are 
new jersey kansas wisconsin california connecticut washington 
west virginia wyoming arkansas and montana

a tale of intrique complete with 
double agents a selfstyled american spy and even imelda marcos 
has clouded prospects for successful talks on the future of us 
military bases here 
the flap began last week when the department of justice released 
the text of testimony by brig gen alejandro galido who the 
government claims infiltrated elements of the military who tried to 
overthrow president corazon aquino in december 
in his testimony galido said he was approached in april by a 
man claiming to be a us air force colonel who offered to sell 
weapons to the rebels for 20 million 
according to galido the alleged colonel said he was a member of 
the defense intelligence agency and supported moves to topple mrs 
aquino 
galido also claimed mrs marcos who is on trial in new york on 
racketeering charges was aware of the conspiracy but was unable to 
finance the arms because of money problems 
us officials have repeatedly declared support for mrs aquino 
during the coup attempt us jets flew air cover in support of 
government forces 
but many filipinos always suspicious of the country that ruled 
the archipelago from 1898 until 1946 believed washington supported 
the conspirators then doublecrossed them to make mrs aquino 
beholden to the united states 
galido never indicated whether the deal was consummated nor 
whether he believed the purported american spy whom he identified 
as harold maglio actually worked for the us government 
on thursday the majority leader of the philippine senate 
demanded that the united states clear the air about maglio the 
senator teofisto guingona said maglio produced a picture that he 
alleged was taken of maglio upon his arrival at manilas airport 
last year 
the us embassy denied that maglio was on its staff or involved 
in philippine affairs it is unclear how much the embassy knows 
about him because us privacy laws limit disclosures of 
information about private citizens without their consent 
the dia also said maglio doesnt work for the us agency 
an official of the mandarin hotel said a guest who registered as 
harold maglio checked in april 30 and left after two days the 
official said the man gave his address as wrightwood calif 
the associated press in manila telephoned maglio in wrightwood 
today but he hung up after saying im not talking to 
reporters 
the disclosures have produced banner headlines in manila 
newspapers about american duplicity 
its not difficult to imagine that the military rightwingers 
in the us government have been encouraging and supporting 
rightwing coup plots while the state departmenthas been 
assuring mrs aquino that the us government had nothing to do 
with rebel forces wrote columnist alvin capino in the philippine 
daily globe 
opponents of the us bases have seized on galidos allegations 
to urge mrs aquino to forgo talks on extending the lease on the 
six installations which expires in 1991 
bases talks are expected to begin next month and mrs aquino 
has given no indication she will cancel them 
any agreement must be approved by twothirds of the 23member 
senate sentiment against the military posts already sharpened 
after cutbacks in promised us aid has hardened with the galido 
allegations 
how can we have exploratory talks this coming april unless the 
us clears the air sen guingona asked how do we continue 
the abiding friendship unless suspicions of inordinate intervention 
remain

the president of a us defense contractor says 
he cooperated with a sting that averted shipment of 40 nuclear 
detonators to iraq because he feared nuclear weapons in the hands 
of irresponsible countries 
the sting came as part of an 18month investigation by us and 
british customs agents that culminated in a federal indictment 
against five people and two british companies 
jerold kowalsky an engineer and president of csi technologies 
inc said he alerted us agents in 1988 to inquiries from alleged 
representatives of iraq into his company which makes electronic 
triggers to military specifications 
he said thursday that the possibility of the devices falling 
into the hands of the iraqi government disturbed him 
i had no qualms in cooperating with the government from the 
beginning kowalsky said i felt like i was doing the right 
thing and i would hope anybody in my shoes would have done the same 
thing 
iraqi officials deny their government is seeking to develop a 
nuclear arsenal 
two of the five people named as defendants in the feb 23 
indictment unsealed thursday in san diego were arrested wednesday 
in london the three others believed to be in iraq were 
identified as engineers for alqaqaa state establishment a weapons 
development unit of iraqs ministry of industry and military 
industrialization us customs officials said 
the indictment alleges that euromac london ltd and atlas 
equipment uk ltd acted on behalf of the iraqi government to 
illegally obtain the devices 
customs officials said euromac was an official purchasing office 
of the iraqi government and had done millions of dollars in 
business in procuring materials for the iraqi government at the 
height of its war with iran 
csi technologies is a us defense contractor kowalsky said he 
felt obliged to cooperate in the investigation 
we cant afford to have nuclear weapons in the hands of 
countries that are irresponsible he said 
among those charged in the indictment were ali daghir 
identified by british authorities as the leader of the alleged 
smuggling operation and jeanine speckman a french woman released 
on bond thursday 
daghir was identified in the indictment as managing director of 
the two companies which allegedly acted as agents for alqaqaa 
speckman was named in the indictment as an export executive for 
euromac and secretary of atlas equipment the indictment alleges 
that she suggested the triggers be shipped in boxes labeled as 
components for air conditioning in computer rooms 
customs officials said it was unlikely the three iraqi engineers 
will ever be arrested the indictment identifies them as karim 
dhaidas omran dafir alazawi and wallid issa ahmad 
the indictment charges that a conspiracy began in september 
1988 when the two british companies allegedly contacted a london 
representative of csi technologies about obtaining the detonators 
kowalsky said his 21yearold 35employee company makes 
electrical components for use in heart defibrillators lasers and 
various transmitters and also has manufactured large quantities of 
capacitors for use in scientific research in iraq 
he said he received a telex from his london representative in 
late 1988 that said the iraqis inquired about csi technologies 
manufacturing capacitors to military specifications they also 
asked if the devices could endure severe shock 
within a couple of minutes of seeing the telex my blood 
turned cold kowalsky said i told myself these guys are 
building a nuclear bomb and i immediately called the cia and 
customs service 
customs agent daniel supnick posing as a csi executive joined 
negotiations last fall with daghir and speckman the indictment 
said 
the indictment charged that the defendants did not seek export 
licenses as required by us law after ordering the detonators from 
csi technologies the company is based in san marcos calif about 
40 miles north of san diego 
the defendants also are charged with money laundering arising 
from the transfer of 10400 from britain to csis account with the 
bank of america in escondido calif to pay for the detonators 
us attorney william braniff in san diego said speckman and 
daghir would be prosecuted in britain first before they could be 
extradited to the united states to face charges

prices on the tokyo stock exchange today dropped 
more than 1000 points in a market dominated by profittaking and 
discouragement while the dollar surged against the yen 
the markets key index the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues lost 104571 points or 337 percent in the markets 
seventh largest singleday decline it ended the week at 2998145 
the nikkei fell 23741 points thursday 
securities dealers said prices fell on selling across the board 
due to a decline in the value of the yen against the dollar and an 
overnight fall on wall street 
brokerages remained on the sidelines because they knew that if 
they bought theyd only be battered by heavy selling said 
yoshihiro ito general manager of stock trading at okasan 
securities 
wide expectations of a further weakening of the yen also sapped 
buying interest said shin tokoi deputy general manager of stock 
trading at county natwest securities 
volume was a relatively light 500 million shares 
in currency dealings the dollar rebounded to close at 15765 
yen up 100 yen from thursdays close of 15665 yen after opening 
at 15680 yen the currency ranged between 15675 yen and 15795 
yen 
it surged sharply higher at midday under what some dealers 
described as suspicious circumstances 
numerous dealers japanese and foreign said a sudden rise to 
almost 158 yen smacked of collusion among the small number of banks 
involved in fixing the yearend rate which was set at 158 yen the 
banks involved appeared to have bid the dollar up to lock in 
windfall profits they said 
an official at the bank of japan said the central bank was 
considering investigating inquiries about the dollars sudden rise 
the yearend rate is used by many firms as a benchmark exchange 
rate 
the dollar has been advancing against the yen for several weeks 
as japanese corporations bought the currency amid general 
pessimism about the yen to help improve their balance sheets at 
the close of their fiscal year 
on thursday the yen made a brief recovery in tokyo after 
rebounding in new york wednesday following intervention by the us 
federal reserve 
but most dealers saw the recovery as temporary they said strong 
demand for dollars due to an outflow of capital from japan is the 
single largest factor pushing the dollars value higher against the 
yen 
the demand for the dollar is very big said a dealer at a 
longterm credit bank 
the price of benchmark no 119 japanese government bond fell to 
8595 points as of 3 pm down from thursdays close of 8672 as 
banks sold off bond holdings the yield rose to 736 percent from 
the previous days close of 72 percent

even though the nations most widely circulated 
medical journal is leapfrogging its new englandbased rival to 
publish earlier in the week the rivals editor poohpoohed any 
threat to his publication 
were more academic we publish the great majority of the 
scientific advances in medical research said dr arnold relman 
editor of the new england journal of medicine we have always 
done that and i believe we will continue to do so 
relmans bostonbased journal publishes on thursdays the 
chicagobased journal of the american medical association which 
published on fridays will change its release date to wednesdays 
next week 
improved production capabilities and the desire to publish 
important research findings as quickly as possible are the two 
top reasons for the change jama says it also wants to give news 
reporters more time at weeks end to develop spinoff stories 
but if you read the ama press release carefully they want 
to come out first before the new england journal of medicine 
relman said wednesday 
i cant understand any other reason beyond the obvious 
competitive one he added in a telephone interview 
dr george lundberg jamas editor acknowledged in a news 
release announcing the change last month i want jama to be 
poised to be able to publish new research findings before other 
medical and scientific journals 
but lundberg maintained on thursday that competition is a lesser 
motive 
articles that appear each week in the new england journal and in 
jama are independent of each other though they do cover 
overlapping subjects sometimes lundberg said 
in such instances we would prefer our authors to have an 
earlier publication date than theirs he said 
we at jama value media coverage greatly because one of our 
basic missions is to educate the public to lead healthier lives 
mark bricklin editor of prevention magazine said jama is 
more like the usa today of medical journals its not as arcane if 
theres an article in jama its apt to have a much greater 
application to the practicing physician 
both journals are heavily covered by the media and their 
release dates have more to do with determining when their contents 
reach airwaves and newspapers than when they reach physicians 
jama published by the nations largest organization of doctors 
has a regular englishlanguage circulation of 293000 including 
the amas more than 290000 members the journal also has 290000 
copies going overseas each week in 12 languages lundberg said 
the 178yearold new england journal the nations oldest 
medical journal is published by the massachusetts medical society 
it has a circulation of about 230000 including 10000 society 
members and about 50000 overseas subscribers relman said 
statistics support relmans claim to greater prestige according 
to the philadelphiabased institute for scientific information 
which tracks how many times articles in 3200 journals are 
subsequently cited in published research 
in 1988 out of these 3200 journals the institute tracks 
worldwide the new england journal ranked seventh said editor 
david pendlebury 
he said the six top finishers were nonmedical journals adding 
the british medical journal lancet ranked 17th the annals of 
internal medicine ranked 39th and jama was 86th 
the new england journal also carries the hottest articles 
pendlebury said thursday a study about a year ago indicated that 
the 100 mostcited articles in life sciences in the previous year 
included nine from the new england journal and three from jama 
we dont feel threatened by a change in their publication 
day relman said it seems to me that the content of what is 
published is vastly more important than the day of the week on 
which it is published 
dr aran ron assistant to the medical director at beth israel 
medical center in new york city and a reader of both journals 
agreed though for different reasons 
i think that jama has more general interesttype articles and 
covers ground a little wider while the the new england journal has 
more scientific specialty and indepth articles ron said i 
dont perceive a big competition

the parliament approved this years budget 
today and tripled funding for religious parties which have held 
the balance of power since the government fell after a 
noconfidence vote earlier this month 
one legislator called israels leaders thieves in the night 
for earmarking 110 million of the 312 billion budget for 
religious insitutions 
the funding was put forward by the rightwing likud bloc headed 
by prime minister yitzhak shamir shimon peres centerleft labor 
party backed the move 
both parties need the backing of the small ultraorthodox 
factions to break the 6060 parliamentary tie that arose after the 
noconfidence motion shamir is caretaker prime minister while 
peres tries to form a government 
both likud and labor have wooed religious parties with offers of 
political jobs and funds for religious seminaries 
the amount allocated to religious institutions in the 199091 
fiscal year budget almost tripled last years funding of 375 
million 
the budget was approved 4010 with eight abstentions after a 
heated debate that stretched more than 40 hours the remaining 62 
legislators did not show up to vote 
the deadline for passage of the budget was saturday 
likud and labor also joined forces to push through 25 million 
for partyaffiliated institutions and 10 million was added to the 
budget for jewish settlements in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
before the budget debate haim oron of the socialist mapam party 
criticized the moves by major parties to woo the religious factions 
the expression theives in the night is not slander it is 
not a bad term for the parliament it is a minimal description in 
polite words of what is going on he said 
likud justice minister dan meridor said the budget suffered 
because of the political crisis 
this budget has things that perhaps in an ordinary period 
could have been refrained from we couldnt refrain from them all 
today he said on israel radio 
but yair levy a legislator of the sixseat ultraorthodox shas 
party was encouraged today we can say we have started the 
process of reducing the gaps between ultraorthodox education and 
regular schooling he said on israel radio 
israelis protested the higher funding for insitutions belonging 
to ultraorthodox jews 
labor party supporters dressed in ultraorthodox fashion with 
black hats and side curls demonstrated outside labor headquarters 
in tel aviv they called on party leaders to stop bowing to 
religious parties israel radio reported 
peres has five more weeks to put together a colation and he said 
he will push for early elections for the 120member parliament if 
he fails rather than give likud an opportunity to establish a 
government 
the coalition negotiations began after shamir was toppled by a 
no confidence motion in parliament over his refusal to accept 
usbacked middle east peace proposals which were supported by 
labor

sir edmund hillary who with his sherpa 
guide was the first to reach the top of the worlds highest 
mountain today warned the majestic himalayas were threatened by 
deforestation and litterbug trekkers 
recalling the remote valleys and foothills he traveled before 
his 1953 ascent to the top of mount everest the 70yearold new 
zealander said in 1951 the people lived a simple hardy 
existence few of them had ever seem a railroad train or a bus 
tourism was unknown 
nowadays tens of thousands are walking the hills tracks 
floating down the rivers landing in tiny airstrips in remote 
valleys the living standards of the himalayan people are 
increasing but the beautiful tracks and valleys have been littered 
and the forests destroyed 
he spoke at the opening session of the first international 
conference on environmental protection of the himalayas 
the twoday conference is sponsored by the himalayan adventure 
trust which hillary helped found two years ago and by the indian 
mountaineering foundation 
hillary who reached the top of mount everest in nepal on may 
29 1953 with sherpa guide tenzing norgay said tourism in the 
himalayas must be spread more thinly and visitors must take their 
trash with them when they leave 
tourist agents must be pressured to make sure their customers 
leave the hills and valleys beautiful he said 
he said huge population increases have sent more farmers into 
the himalayas in search of survival the local people are forced 
higher and higher to cut trees and make terraces for their crops 
when will it ever stop he asked 
maneka gandhi indias minister of state for environment and 
forests warned deforestation and pollution would have disastrous 
results reaching far beyond the himalayan highlands 
today the himalayas are crumbling said mrs gandhi the 
sisterinlaw of exprime minister rajiv gandhi the 
disappearance of the himalayas will mean the desertification of 
india and neighboring areas we have to preserve the himalayas or 
we perish 
she said the new government of prime minister vp singh whose 
janata dal coalition ousted rajiv gandhis congress party in last 
novembers elections was considering a 175 million plan to 
regreen the himalayas

manager and chamber of commerce to get the south beach district 
listed on the national register of historic places its the only 
district with 20th century architecture on the register 
the historic status brought federal tax breaks to the 
economically depressed area now in the midst of an economic and 
cultural renaissance that even ms capitmans harshest critics

a recent sampling of moscow residents shows more 
than half of them could be mobilized by antisemites the american 
jewish committee says 
committee president sholom d comay told reporters thursday the 
survey indicates a significant part of the soviet population openly 
dislikes jews holds negative stereotypes about them or is at 
best neutral about jews and thus open to manipulation 
the sampling of 509 adults during february and march found 18 
percent indicated they disliked jews 65 percent indicated they 
were neutral and 18 percent indicated they liked jews 
the 65 percent who were neutral about jews are open to 
manipulation by enemies of jews and likely can be mobilized by 
antisemites committee research director david singer said 
history teaches that jews are secure only when people have 
genuinely positive feelings toward them he said it is not 
enough that people be nonantisemitic 
the committee called on president mikhail gorbachev and the 
soviet leadership to condemn manifestations of antisemitism 
of those surveyed 91 percent said jews should be free to 
decide for themselves whether they want to remain in the soviet 
union or emigrate 
and 90 percent agreed that the government should make every 
effort to see that the rights of jews to equal educational 
opportunities are respected and 88 percent favored equal 
employment opportunities for jews 
the study was conducted under the auspices of the institute of 
sociology of the soviet academy of sciences and directed by 
political scientists james gibson and raymond duch of the 
university of houston 
the study funded by the committee the national science 
foundation and the university of houston involved questions on 350 
items it has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage 
points 
other findings included 
thirtythree percent maintained that when it comes to 
choosing between people and money jews will choose money

twentythree percent agreed that jews have too much influence 
over russian culture while 21 percent were uncertain and 56 
percent disagreed

they killed christ while 15 percent were uncertain and 75 
percent disagreed 
eight percent agreed that jews more than any other group 
are responsible for the problems the soviet union is experiencing 
today thirteen percent were uncertain and 79 percent disagreed 
concerning views about other peoples antisemitism 48 percent 
said that antijewish feeling is on the rise around here today 
while 44 percent termed it about the same only 5 percent saw 
it diminishing

antijewish 60 percent said only some people are antijewish 
and 19 percent said very few people are antijewish

rival christian militias today renewed 
savage combat in east beirut and in hills northeast of the city 
ending a nearly monthlong ceasefire police said two people were 
killed 
thunderous blasts reverberated across beirut and black clouds of 
smoke hung over the city and nearby hills as fires burned out of 
control 
thousands of families huddled in basements and underground 
shelters and radios blared hospital appeals for blood donations 
at least two people were killed and one person wounded in the 
clashes police said 
the patriarch of the maronite church today threatened to 
excommunicate both gen michel aoun and rival christian warlord 
samir geagea whose struggle for domination of lebanons christian 
enclave has killed at least 778 people and wounded 2157 since jan 
30 
police said aouns army and geageas lebanese gorces militia 
were locked in combat in the central sector of christian east 
beirut and in the mountains of kesrouan province 20 miles 
northeast of the capital 
the ceasefire has collapsed its past history said a 
police spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules its 
allout war again 
the police spokesman said no casualty report could be compiled 
yet but there are indications there are plenty of killed and 
wounded people 
the warring factions accused each other of torpedoing a march 3 
ceasefire called by neutral christian mediators to halt the power 
struggle the most savage intrachristian fighting in the 
15yearold lebanese civil war 
aouns army command said that geageas lebanese forces launched 
tankled thrusts on two fronts at first light to break through army 
lines in beiruts christian sector and the mountains in kesrouan 
province 
both assaults were repulsed the attackers suffered heavy 
losses in lives and equipment in east beiruts badaro district and 
kesrouans kleiatdareya axis said a communique from aouns 
command 
a lebanese forces communique said aouns tanks and armored 
personnel carriers were mounting charges from east beirut into the 
resort town of kleiat behind massive artillery bombardment in an 
attempt to open the way for his troops to capture kesrouan 
the lebanese forces are preventing aouns units from 
accomplishing their objectives although they are using phosphorous 
and cluster bombs the communique said 
the militias chief spokesman george abdulmassih later told 
the associated press the lebanese forces pushed aouns army 
almost completely out of kleiat and were advancing towrds the 
nearby town of dareya 
before the outbreak of the new fighting aouns army held a 
quarter of kleiat the rest was under lebanese forces control 
as the fighting escalated aouns and geageas radio stations 
canceled their regular programs to broadcast only martial music 
patriotic songs and war communiques 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir spiritual head of the dominant 
maronite catholic community of which both aoun and geagea are 
members made his excommmunication threat at midmorning from his 
seat in bkirki which overlooks the mediterranean it was his 
second since the fighting began 
this horrific destructive shelling which the army and the 
lebanese forces blame on each other has forced people to flee 
their homes and take shelter in forests sfeir said in the appeal 
that was broadcast by christian radio stations 
how dare they claim they are defending christian land while 
they are turning it into scorched earth sfeir added 
aouns 19000 troops and geageas 6000member militia are 
fighting for control of the enclave where lebanons estimated 1 
million christians live 
aoun has refused to recognize the authority of elected president 
elias hrawi and has ignored his dismissal as army commander 
aoun geagea and hrawi are all maronites the 900000strong 
catholic sect that has dominated government since lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 
hrawi was elected president by parliament to implement political 
reforms designed to give moslems an equal share of power and end 
the civil war 
that was part of an arab leaguebrokered peace treaty endorsed 
by lebanons parliament in october 
aoun rejects that accord because it does not guarantee the 
withdrawal of the 40000member syrian force which he considers an 
army of occupation 
aoun considers them an army of occupation

state lawmakers failed to pass three bills 
stemming from the nations worst drunkendriving accident 
its just a sad day for kentucky that we cant get them 
through said sen virgil pearman whose nephew was the church 
bus driver killed with 26 other people in the fiery crash 
the bills which would have toughened drunkendriving laws 
added a leftside door to school buses and created a felony crime 
of vehicular homicide when a drunken driver caused traffic deaths 
effectively were defeated thursday 
pearman said his advocacy of bills on other major state issues 
local control of solid waste and community health systems may 
have hurt the highway safety measures 
maybe i was shoving too much too fast on some hot topics 
said pearman a democrat 
the bills cleared the senate with little or no opposition but 
stalled in house committees during the final days of the 1990 
legislative session 
as a result the legislature passed no bills directly related to 
the may 1988 crash a pickup truck slammed into a church bus on 
interstate 71 near carrollton in northern kentucky killing 24 
children and three adults returning from a church outing 
larry mahoney was driving drunk when his pickup on the wrong 
side of the highway crashed headon into the bus mahoney was 
convicted of manslaughter assault wanton endangerment and drunken 
driving and was sentenced to 16 years in prison he is appealing 
the case 
pearmans nephew john 37 was the bus driver he died trying 
to save his passengers his uncle believed the national attention 
given the crash and mahoneys trial would help the legislation he 
backed 
i thought it was possible with all the publicity pearman 
said im devastated that the things are all dead 
but thats the way the system works you never know ive been 
here for 15 years and ive had my ups and downs this is just one 
of the down years 
the drunkendriving bill would have made it illegal to drive 
with a certain bloodalcohol level kentucky is one of just a 
handful of states not to have such wording in their drunkendriving 
law instead drivers in the state are merely presumed to be drunk 
when their bloodalcohol reading reaches 10 percent critics say 
such wording makes it easier for people accused of drunken driving 
to avoid convictions 
another key section would have allowed the revocation of a 
drivers license before the trial of some people charged with dui 
that section had raised concerns from some democratic house leaders 
if you lose your drivers license and you live in a remote 
area of my couty you dont have a mass transit system to get to 
work said house majority leader greg stumbo

island railroad ok 
the hall was sold out by 1096 people who paid 16 each they 
clapped hummed along and even shouted ole as graseck played a 
program of bach paganini and schubert 
i dont like classical music i just like jimmy said joe 
abrams a transit policeman who knows graseck from penn station and 
brought his wife to the concert 
graseck 36 saved 5000 to rent the hall partly from money he 
earned in subways and trains with few other expenses for the 
concert and the sellout crowd thursday he stands to make a profit 
he said 
it is a dream come true in a way he said before his 
performance 
graseck grinned throughout the show and at one juncture pointed 
to a group seated near the stage from the flushing queens

he ended with a dozen encores classical excerpts running just 
three to five minutes each about the time one has to wait for a 
train

the leader of one of east germanys top 
political parties got a firsthand look today at files kept on him 
by the despised secret police knowing his career hangs in the 
balance by what is revealed 
ibrahim boehme chairman of the leftleaning social democratic 
party and one of the countrys most charismatic politicians has 
been wrestling with allegations that he was an informer for the 
nowdisbanded secret police 
the social democrats who placed second in east germanys march 
18 elections are in crucial negotiations with the winning 
conservative coalition about forming a grand coalition 
government 
boehme has denied allegations he had links to the stasi secret 
police 
he temporarily stepped down from the party chairman post last 
week saying he wanted his name cleared he demanded access to the 
records kept on him 
today accompanied by two lawyers boehme entered the sprawling 
former secret police building in east berlin to view the files 
wolfgang schlauer a member of a citizens committee controlling 
disbandment of the secret police told reporters it could take 
several hours before boehme reads through material compiled on him 
meanwhile committees of the social democrats and the winning 
christian democratic union met separately to discuss a possible 
coalition and organization of east germanys first freely elected 
government 
the process of forming the government has been overshadowed by 
allegations that many members of the new 400member parliament 
worked with the stasi 
among them is lothar de maiziere the christian democratic 
chairman who has also denied any links with the secret police 
despite the allegations de maiziere has said he hopes the new 
parliament can convene next week 
outgoing parliament speaker guenther maleuda on thursday also 
said he wants the parliament to convene quickly to stabilize the 
drifting nation 
maleuda met with newly elected members of parliament and 
recommended that the body hold its first session on april 5 the 
state news agency adn said 
the lawmakers elected in east germanys first free elections 
march 18 have been bogged down in talks on forming a governing 
coalition that will determine the pace for unification with west 
germany 
but adn said maleuda who leads the lameduck parliament that 
contains vestiges of the old communist regime wants new lawmakers 
to meet soon to give the nation some stability and leadership 
after hardline communist leader erich honecker was toppled oct 
18 during massive nationwide demonstrations the country has been 
run by a reformminded interim government dominated by the 
communists who have little public support 
meanwhile the two leading political factions of the new 
leadership said thursday that they agreed on the basic points of 
forming a majority coalition 
de maiziere is trying to form a government with the social 
democrats 
the groups said in a joint statement that they concurred on 
most basic points and that their differences are negotiable 
a coalition with the social democrats would give de maziere the 
twothirds majority he needs to control parliament and muscle 
through his proposal for swift unification with wealthy west 
germany 
but the social democrats have expressed concern about whether 
they can work with the more conservative members of de maizieres 
threeparty alliance 
the social democrats also favor a more gradual process for 
unification than the conservatives 
we are of the opinion that the situation we must negotiate 
and the responsibility we have is so serious that we must each 
discuss it with our governing bodies de maiziere told reporters

the franciscan religious order concluded an 
inquiry into allegations of sexual impropriety against the rev 
bruce ritter and announced no results except a request that the 
founder of covenant house live in a friary 
it was a private investigation the rev juniper alwell a 
franciscan provincial council official said thursday the 
results are private thats as far as were going to go 
alwell said the roman catholic order conducted its investigation 
with no help from outside professionals and did not intend to act 
like a prosecutor but the franciscans will cooperate with civil 
authorities looking into other questions raised recently about a 
covenant house charitable trust the council said in a statement 
ritter 62 resigned feb 27 as director of covenant house the 
shelter for runaway youths he founded and built into an 85 
millionayear international operation the council said his 
resignation came with the prior knowledge and urging of his 
superiors 
four young men runaways whom ritter befriended have been 
quoted as saying they had sex with him 
the new york times today quoted an anonymous church official as 
saying he expected ritter to ask to leave the franciscan order 
although he might remain a priest the order did not plan to give 
ritter an assignment or ministry the official said 
in its statement the franciscan council said it decided ritter 
should return to daily living with his franciscan community 
ritter who has not lived in a religious community for more than 
20 years will meet with church officials before they determine 
where he will go alwell said 
asked where ritter was now alwell said he did exactly what 
we asked him to do which was to rest and recuperate as much as 
possible remove himself from the media 
district attorney robert morgenthau has said he had found 
insufficient evidence of financial misconduct to charge ritter with 
any crime but morgenthau said some questionable financial 
transactions had been made in connection with expenditures for 
kevin kite a former male prostitute who alleged that ritter had 
sex with him 
morgenthau also said the law may have been violated when 
covenant house supplied kite with a false identity using papers of 
a dead 10yearold

the name czechoslovak federative republic was adopted 
thursday night after a daylong discussion in the federal parliament 
and weeks of growing tensions between the czechs and slovaks

johnny neun a former majorleague manager and 
one of only nine players to execute an unassisted triple play died 
wednesday of pancreatic cancer he was 89 
neun spent four years with the detroit tigers and ended his 
majorleague career with the boston braves in 1931 compiling a 
lifetime 289 batting average 
he executed his gameending triple play on may 31 1927 in 
detroit when he was playing first base for the tigers in a game 
against the cleveland indians 
detroit held a onerun lead in the top of the ninth when the 
first two cleveland batters glen myatt and charley jamieson 
reached base homer summa was at bat 
then he summa hit a line drive straight at me and i caught 
it for the first out neun said in an interview with the sun in 
1964 
jamieson had started from first to second and was right in 
front of me so i tagged him two out 
i looked over and saw that myatt was racing for third 
apparently thinking summa had got a hit i ran over and touched 
second base and the game was over neun said

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany today said 
a treaty confirming polands current borders should coincide with 
acknowledgment by poland that it mistreated germans who came under 
its rule after world war ii 
kohl was asked at a news conference to amplify on a speech he 
made to an anglogerman group in cambridge thursday night in which 
he urged poland to follow czechoslovakias example and recognize 
the injustice of expelling millions of germans 
in his reply kohl suggested that such a declaration should be 
made when a unified germany signs a treaty enshrining the existing 
oderneisse line as the legal and final germanpolish border 
there is the question of recognition of the oderneisse 
border to anchor it in a treaty of a unified germany with 
poland he said that is a historic moment and i think it is 
very good thing if at such a moment one can actually find a word of 
reconciliation 
he reiterated that he was not demanding an apology he did not 
specify whether such a declaration should be oral or in the form of 
a document 
kohls comments were seen in west germany as a new effort to 
keep the german exiles and their offspring on his side in national 
elections dec 2 about 13 million germans were expelled from 
prewar german territories that now are part of poland and 
czechoslovakia 
in warsaw government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said 
today that nazi atrocities far outweighed those committed by poles 
after the war but she wanted to hear exactly what kohl said before 
commenting further 
she stressed at a news conference that poles have spoken 
repeatedly of reconciliation she referred to a historic 1965 
letter from polish bishops to west german church leaders which said 
the poles forgave and asked forgiveness 
we think we have made so many statements on this issue that 
its clear she said 
kohl recalled that czechoslovak president vaclav havel already 
has expressed remorse over the postwar expulsion of the germans 
from his country 
if between germans and poles we could find similar words and 
we could talk to each other like that then this is a real peace 
and this is what i hope for he said 
the german leader was clearly aware of the sensitivity of such 
remarks given nazi atrocities in poland during the war on 
thursday he departed from his prepared text to tone it down so as 
not to accuse poland directly of mistreating the germans 
in the speech he also stressed he was not making any demand for 
a polish apology just a recognition of the injustice that was 
also inflicted on innocent germans 
we germans are not entitled to such words and even less must 
we try to balance accounts in one way or another he said 
earlier this year kohl had angered poles and worried officials 
in other european countries by refusing to guarantee that a unified 
germany would respect polands existing borders kohl made a 
forthright pledge last month that germany would not seek to change 
the borders 
onethird of poland was german territory before the war and 
warsaw has demanded both german states promise to honor polands 
borders before uniting 
kohl and prime minister margaret thatcher spoke at cambridge 
university for the 40th anniversary of the koenigswinter 
conference set up to foster anglogerman relations five years 
after the defeat of nazi germany in 1945

as his selfimposed saturday deadline 
approached gov cecil andrus expressed reservations about some 
provisions of what would become the nations most restrictive state 
abortion law 
but he said his concern will not necessarily translate into the 
veto abortion rights activists have been demanding under threats of 
economic retaliation 
my views being prolife havent changed he said thursday 
but i am concerned about the bill i am concerned that this bill 
may narrow it to the point where a woman who has suffered rape who 
has suffered incest or the mothers life is in danger might not be 
able to receive an abortion 
im agonizing over it 
another 1000 abortion rights advocates held their ninth 
straight candlelight vigil on the steps of the capitol thursday 
night continuing to press their case for a veto 
earlier in the day a smaller group dumped 10000 potatoes on the 
statehouse steps to show their support for the boycott if the bill 
becomes law 
state lawmakers were expected to adjourn the 1990 session about 
midday today if andrus decided to veto the bill and waited until 
after the adjournment to do so the legislature would not have the 
chance to even consider an override 
chances for an override which would take twothirds majorities 
in each house would be slim in any event when the bill was 
passed opponents had seven more votes than needed to block an 
override in the house and two more than necessary in the senate 
antiabortion forces tried to counter a potato boycott by 
pledging to buy even more idaho products in what the concerned 
women for america said was a commitment to this cause out of 
respect for the courageous men and women in the idaho legislature 
but with some idaho businessmen reporting order cancellations 
because of the abortion vote the state commerce department was 
developing contingency plans to cope with whatever decision andrus 
makes on the bill 
it makes abortion illegal except in cases of nonstatutory rape 
reported within seven days incest if the victim is under 18 
severe fetal deformity and a threat to the life or physical health 
of the woman if signed it will take effect july 1 
some legal scholars have said it is so restrictive it will be 
voided by the us supreme court but the national right to life 
committee helped draft the bill so that a promised court challenge 
will give the high court the opportunity to reverse its 1973 
decision legalizing abortion 
andrus has been consulting with legal scholars church officials 
and other experts but he said there was no consensus on the issue 
brian johnston of the national right to life committee said the 
governor expressed doubts on thursday because the only people he 
had spoken with are those who actually oppose this bill 
an aide said that later in the day the governor spoke with david 
smolin of samford university in alabama smolin is the 
constitutional scholar antiabortion advocates have relied on to 
counter the constitutional questions 
despite prospects of economic retaliation commerce director 
james hawkins remained confident the state finally in the midst of 
an economic resurgence after suffering through harsh times during 
most of the 1980s would weather any assault 
we do have political issues in this state but i dont know 
about any political streams or political potatoes hawkins said 
what im worried about is people being divided we need to bring 
them back together

drug recovered significantly more function than untreated patients 
in a clinical trial a federal agency reported today 
the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke said 
that in a clinical trial of 487 patients with acute spinal cord 
injury those treated with the drug methylprednisolone within eight 
hours of the injury recovered more motor and sensory function than 
those treated with other drugs or with a placebo 
the study started in 1977 was conducted at 10 us medical 
centers 
the report said that 162 patients were treated with 
methylprednisolone another 154 patients received naloxone and 171 
patients received placebos 
motor and sensory functions were assessed on admission and again 
six weeks after treatment and finally six months after injury 
the report said patients received methylprednisolone showed 
significant improvement in both muscle function and pin and touch 
sensation at six weeks and six months after injury the 
announcement said 
the drug must be given within eight hours of injury to be 
effective the study said 
the announcement said that the dose of methylprednisolone is 
critical and the successful dose was 30 milligrams for each 
kilogram of patient weight followed by an infusion of 54 
milligrams per kilogram of weight per hour for 23 hours 
lower doses of the medication were found not to be effective 
about 10000 americans each year suffer spinal cord injury with 
paralysis and the direct cost to the federal government for medical

caught fire two weeks ago was not damaged as extensively as first 
believed administration sources say 
there is far less damage there than we first thought an 
administration source said thursday speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
us officials have charged that the plant was producing poison 
gas but the libyans said it was making medicine 
after reports of the fire became known us officials said 
damage to the plant appeared to have been extensive and white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the plant was out of 
business 
the administration source declined to specify how the 
information had been obtained us intelligence agencies have 
relied on satellite photographs for such information in the past 
nor did the source offer an estimate on how long it would take 
to repair the plant and get it back into production before the 
fire us officials said it appeared that the plant after a long 
period of little production had begun turning out limited 
quantities of mustard and nerve gases 
the plant about 60 miles southwest of tripoli caught fire on 
march 14 
the libyan ambassador to italy said last week that the fire had 
caused great damage and that it had been set by a worker at the 
plant the ambassador told reporters several people had been 
arrested and that the person responsible would be executed 
last week a french company said photographs taken by the 
european spot i satellite showed that the plant was not heavily 
damaged by the fire 
the photograph showed some black traces on buildings apparently 
used for storage about 800 yards from the main plant 
the principal structures of the libyan chemical factory at 
rabta dont seem to have been touched christian barnard a 
spokesman for spot image said last week 
libya has accused the united states israel and west germany of 
being behind the burning of the plant all three countries have

the department of housing and urban 
developments inspector general is investigating three nobid 
contracts awarded to close friends by the embattled director of a 
new agency that controls millions of dollars in housing money 
inspector general paul a adams in a preliminary report to 
secretary jack kemp said the contracts may have been issued in 
violation of government regulations a hud source speaking on the 
condition of anonymity said thursday night 
adams today declined to discuss any preliminary findings but 
said he hoped to make a final report to kemp next week adams said 
he began the investigation of the federal housing finance board 
contracting procedures on monday at kemps request and has received 
full cooperation from the agency 
kemp raised questions about the contracts during a lengthy 
meeting thursday with mary k bush the housing secretarys 
handpicked choice to head the new agency the meeting was arranged 
after behindthescenes effort by kemp aides to exert influence 
over the independent agency became public 
ms bush has asked peter wallison a former reagan 
administration attorney now in private practice to represent her 
during the investigation according to her spokesman she is not 
related to president bush attempts to reach ms bush and wallison 
today were unsuccessful both were reported to be out of town 
joseph slye the spokesman for the housing board confirmed that 
adams had visited the agency earlier this week and taken several 
contract files he said ms bush had asked the boards own 
inspector general to look into the contracts after hud officials 
raised questions about them last week 
ms bush awarded the three consulting contracts in question to 
three close friends with whom she had worked in the reagan 
administration 
the recipients included wendell gunn kemps former chief of 
staff at hud and margery waxman who in 1988 represented charles 
keating in his thensuccessful effort to persuade regulators not to 
seize a troubled california savings and loan he owned lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif 
both slye and hud sources refused to provide details of kemps 
meeting with ms bush also unclear was whether adams got involved 
in the investigation at kemps request as suggested by the hud 
source or at the request of the finance boards own inspector 
general 
the board oversees the 12 regional federal home loan banks 
which must give up 400 million of their profits each year to help 
pay for the bailout of the savings and loan industry 
congress also directed the regional banks to put a percentage of 
their profits each year into affordable housing programs starting 
with 78 million this year and rising to 100 million 
control of those subsidies and the new agencys plum patronage 
jobs was the prize in the effort by kemp aides to gain 
considerable influence over the housing finance board 
kemp recruited ms bush last year and promised to name her the 
panels chairwoman she agreed to take the title of managing 
director until her appointment was made and she was confirmed by 
the senate 
ms bush never received the appointment however leaving the 
agency under the control of kemp who as housing secretary is the 
only permanent board member 
kemp and aides publicly blamed the delay on the bureaucracy and 
on a debate with congress over whether the board members should be 
full time or part time as hud aides want 
as recently as a week ago kemp restated his support for ms bush 
but hud sources and an internal memo obtained by the associated 
press and department sources provided evidence that an effort to 
oust ms bush began some time ago after she reportedly balked at 
some of the departments ideas for the agency 
the memo written seven weeks ago by hud undersecretary alfred 
a dellibovi ended with an account of the plans of a housing 
finance board consultant to end his work there 
if he goes lets hope he takes mary was its final statement 
ms bush left a vice presidency at the federal national mortgage 
association to take the housing finance board job she worked at 
the treasury department during the reagan administration

riccardo muti who kept the philadelphia 
orchestra in the international limelight during a decade as music 
director has decided to quit after the 199192 season 
muti shocked the orchestra thursday with the announcement that 
he will not renew his contract when it expires in 1992 he said his 
devotion to music has left him too little time for a personal life 
muti 48 will continue as music director at the opera house la 
scala in milan italy and have the title of laureate conductor in 
philadelphia he will maintain a relationship with the philadelphia 
orchestra through recording contracts and as guest conductor 
it was very hard for me to say what i said muti said but 
i have felt the last year under great pressure and stress 
he said a career on two continents has left him little time for 
his personal life and he simply wants more time to think and to 
read to have a life 
it reached a point where i felt it was time for me to take 
care of myself i have sometimes felt like a man without air he 
said 
mutis decision caught the orchestra by surprise said theodore 
a burtis president of the philadelphia orchestra association 
we are all in shock but we do understand burtis said 
the director said he decided to announce his decision now 
rather than wait two years to give the orchestra time to search 
for a replacement 
muti succeeded eugene ormandy who in 44 years took the 
orchestra to international prominence under muti the philadelphia 
orchestra continued that legacy 
since he took over as music director in 1980 the orchestras 
subscription concerts have been sold out every year and tours have 
taken the musicians around the world the orchestra also 
commissioned new works resumed opera performances and expanded its 
recording contracts 
mutis first role as as a principal conductor and music director 
came in 1969 with the maggio musicale fiorentino in florence 
italy where he served for 11 years in 1972 he succeeded otto 
klemperer as principal conductor of the philharmonia orchestra of 
london

the deputy republican leader in the senate 
urged colleagues today not to reject out of hand a 
deficitreduction plan by rep dan rostenkowski that would raise 
taxes and freeze most government spending 
those who stand ready to rip apart and ridicule this proposal 
must be prepared to offer a thoughtful substitute sen alan 
simpson of wyoming wrote in the washington post 
simpson wrote that rostenkowski dill who chairs the house 
ways and means committee has dared to speak the unspeakable 
that our monstrous deficit can be eliminated only with some real 
discomfort for every one of us 
for that reason the senator added every element of his plan 
and core of any serious deficitreduction plan is going to be 
political quicksand to various members of congress 
while not endorsing all parts of rostenkowskis plan simpson 
said we should all endorse and admire the spirit in which it was 
made and contribute some spirit and energy of our own its 
flashier to chop a plan to shreds than to create a new one 
rostenkowskis plan would eliminate the federal deficit by 1993 
by cutting the defense budget more deeply than the bush 
amdinistration prefers freezing most federal programs including 
social security benefits for a year eliminating for one year the 
automatic inflation adjustments in the income tax raising income 
taxes on the richest 600000 americans and boosting taxes on 
gasoline cigarettes beer and wine 
president bush has said the proposal deserves consideration but 
he said he has not changed his opposition to increasing taxes

a man who killed a young woman in a drunken 
driving accident eight years ago was ordered jailed for failing to 
abide by an agreement to pay 1 a week to the victims parents for 
18 years 
however fairfax county circuit court judge jack b stevens 
suspended the sentence thursday to allow kevin tunell a chance to 
appeal 
tunell then 17 killed susan herzog on new years morning 1982 
while he was driving under the influence 
a settlement of a civil lawsuit required him to send a 1 check 
every friday because friday was the night miss herzog died the 
agreement required that checks be mailed each week for 18 years as 
many years as she lived 
patricia and louis herzog went back to fairfax county circuit 
court on thursday arguing that tunell now 26 was in contempt 
because he had failed to make the required weekly payments since 
march 1989 
we just wanted a remembrance or a reminder said mrs 
herzog we felt like if he did this for 18 years he wouldnt 
forget susan herzog to make a long story short he kept 
forgetting 
tunell broke into tears on the stand telling stevens he was not 
trying to hurt the herzogs tunell said he is constantly haunted by 
susan herzogs death and tormented by the weekly payments 
i just dont feel good it hurts he said 
tunell was convicted in juvenile court of manslaughter and 
drunken driving and agreed to make the 1 payments to settle a 
15 million lawsuit filed by the herzogs at 1 a week the 
payments for 18 years amount to 936 
tunells criminal sentence on the manslaughter conviction was to 
spend a year speaking to groups about the evils of drunken driving 
he completed that sentence he said and then spent the next six 
years continuing to speak to groups across the country and made two 
videos on the subject 
despite those efforts tunell testified he has remained haunted 
by a vision of susan herzog i used to like lie in bed and if i 
heard the house settling or noises i used to think susan was going 
to come visit me he said 
from the stand thursday he offered the herzogs two boxes of 
checks that he had prewritten up until 2001 a year more than 
what was required by the agreement 
the herzogs shook their heads it was the principle they 
argued although tunell as of thursday was up to date on his bill 
the herzogs had received an envelope of 47 checks of 1 each they 
would accept only weekly payments 
what we want is to receive that check every week on time 
mrs herzog said he must understand we are going to pursue this 
until august of the year 2000 we will go back to court every month 
if we have to

legislation declaring the third monday in 
january an official state holiday honoring martin luther king jr 
won final legislative approval today 
senate passage of the bill establishing the martin luther king 
jridaho human rights day removed idaho from the dwindling list of 
states still refusing to honor the slain civil rights leader with 
an official holiday 
the bill clearing the senate on a 2811 vote now goes to gov 
cecil andrus who called for its passage in his state of the state 
address to open the session last january 
weve come a long way down the road said sen mary lou 
reed a democrat citing the past four years since the state 
designated the third monday in january as a commemorative day for 
king 
only three other states are now without king holidays montana 
new hampshire and arizona 
the idaho measure however faced a somewhat rocky road in a 
legislature that has passed some of the toughest antiracism laws 
in the nation including a criminal malicious harassment law and 
mandatory hatecrime reporting 
after winning initial senate passage it was sidetracked in the 
house until a compromise was agreed to on the formal name the 
agreement added idaho human rights day to the designation 
the holiday was pushed by lawmakers and the governor in part to 
offset the negative image the state has developed because of the 
presence of white supremacists at the aryan nations compound of 
richard butler in northern idaho 
but now with the new holiday and the laws enacted in past 
sessions mrs reed said we have the finest package of human 
rights legislation in the nation 
richard butler and his small band is just a pitiful bunch 
she said the aryan nations people are now moving into the states 
of wyoming and montana 
the major opposition focused on the potential cost of another 
day off for government workers estimated anywhere between 100000 
and 2 million depending on whether payroll is considered and 
kings radical political background 
andrus said however that more than a holiday to honor one 
man it will be a day to honor all like him who believe that no 
person can truly be free when even one other person is denied 
liberty

judges today acquitted a mental patient 
of murder in the death of a 9yearold girl he stabbed 34 times at 
a street fair after escaping from a hospital 
the threemember panel of superior court judges said david r 
peterson was innocent by reason of insanity they returned him to 
whiting forensic institute the states maximumsecurity 
psychiatric hospital 
peterson 38 used the insanity plea in the stabbing of jessica 
short of wallingford he attacked her at random at a downtown 
sidewalk sale after walking away from connecticut valley hospital 
last july 28 
the state sought a murder conviction arguing that peterson 
planned the attack showing he knew what he was doing 
peterson is a chronic paranoid schizophrenic with a history of 
mental illness and violence dating to his youth he has spent 15 of 
his past 20 years in mental institutions in 1971 and again in 
1988 he was found innocent by reason of insanity in stabbing 
attacks and ordered committed to state hospitals 
about two hours before he killed the girl peterson had been 
screaming over the medication he was receiving for pain in his legs 
and arms according to testimony he wanted doctors to change the 
medication 
a psychiatrist hired by the defense said peterson should have 
been confined to his ward after the outburst because he had a 
history of psychotic delusions accompanied by violence 
instead peterson was allowed to follow his normal routine 
including going outside on the hospital grounds without 
supervision he took a bus downtown bought a hunting knife and 
attacked the girl bystanders and police pulled him away as he was 
stabbing her 
peterson told police shortly after the slaying that he killed 
the girl as revenge on his doctors he told psychiatrists he had 
pictured himself as a soldier marching into battle 
assistant states attorney timothy liston said peterson used the 
battle scenario to resort to defenses that won him acquittal in the 
previous stabbings 
peterson chose to be tried by the judges instead of a jury

the ruling communists and the democratic 
opposition today set june dates for the countrys first free 
elections since world war ii and replaced the governing state 
council with a president chosen by parliament 
also today the government said it suspended payments on 
principal for its 10 billion foreign debt but that it will 
continue paying the interest 
the message to creditors on thursday called the move a temporary 
measure to give breathing room while bulgaria implements broad 
economic reform 
the communists and democratic opposition decided to hold 
parliamentary elections on june 10th and 17th the first free 
elections in bulgaria in 45 years said the government news agency 
bta 
the two sides also agreed to dismantle the state council whose 
president is the nations leader and create a presidency chosen by 
parliament bta said 
petar mladenov 53 bulgarias current communist president will 
be formally elected to the new post by the current 
communistdominated parliament and replaced after the june 
elections the news agency said 
the state council had been chosen by parliament but as in 
neighboring romania and other east european countries the council 
ruled in between the infrequent sessions of the countries 
parliaments which rubberstamped communist party policies 
it was not immediately clear if the two sides managed to resolve 
their disagreement over the makeup of a new parliament and a draft 
electoral law 
communist party chief alexander lilov said tuesday the new 
parliament chosen at junes elections should sit for four years 
because we need a strong government at a time when the country is 
in crisis bulgarian state radio reported 
zhelyu zhelev the head of the union of democratic forces the 
umbrella opposition group and other opposition leaders want the 
new parliament to serve only as a constituent assembly that sits 
for 18 months to pass a new constitution and other democratic laws 
the government sent a letter to its creditors thursday 
suspending its debt payments the bulgarian embassy in london said 
today 
the government is compelled to temporarily freeze the 
payments said the notification to creditors quoted by the 
embassy 
but the letter added that our efforts would continue to 
regularly pay the interest due on the credits 
the letter said bulgaria found it impossible to carry out the 
radical economic and currency reforms in the country and at the 
same time pay the full amount of the amounts due on the credits 
bulgaria hasnt fixed a specific date for resumption of 
principal payments said a diplomat at the embassy who demanded 
anonymity 
bankers said that the telexed notice signed by the executive 
board of the bulgarian foreign trade bank offered to meet with the 
banks 
the notice did not however outline a timetable and did not 
indicate whether bulgaria wants to meet with banks individually or 
create a bank committee for bilateral discussions

buffalos transit agency says it is running 
out of money and will suspend bus and subway service for its 
120000 daily riders after saturday night 
niagara frontier transportation authority commissioners voted 
81 for the suspension thursday saying the erie county 
legislatures rejection of a transit tax gave them no choice 
the community has told us they do not want a transit system 
chairman robert d gioia said they do not want to be burdened by 
12 a year the chamber of commerce has told us that is too much 
to ask 
the tax on public utilities that the county legislature rejected 
wednesday would have cost the average family less than 2 a month 
it was bitterly opposed by the national fuel naturalgas company 
and other business groups 
three hours before the commissioners voted transit authority 
executive director alfred h savage said the county legislatures 
action had persuaded him to resign at the end of april 
this morning the chicago transit authority named savage its 
executive director giving him a threeyear contract with a salary 
of 149500 a year savage who turned 60 on thursday had said he 
was considering either retiring or accepting the cta post 
savage informed commissioners before the vote that the agency 
will have just 89000 in the bank by saturday night officials 
said the shutdown will save up to half a million dollars a week 
but will cost 13 million the first week mostly because of the 
final payroll 
the money will be siphoned from the authoritys profitable 
greater buffalo international airport operation authority 
officials have said federal law prohibits them from using airport 
revenues as a continuing transit subsidy 
buffalo with a population of more than 350000 is the states 
secondlargest city but is the smallest us metropolitan area 
with a subway a 5yearold line if it abandons the bus and subway 
system it will be the biggest us city without any public transit 
the crisis occurred when costs rose and federal and state 
funding did not keep pace the state insisted the county enact a 
special tax but county legislators shot down proposals for sales 
property mortgage and gasoline taxes as well as the utility tax 
the county legislatures chairman roger blackwell said he 
would try to get his colleagues to come up with some sort of a tax 
or combination of taxes that could attract the necessary 12 votes 
but he said it probably would not be possible before saturday night

a mother bear and her cub were returned 
to their mountain home seven months after she suffered a 7200volt 
shock and burns as she fell drugged by tranquilizer darts from a 
utility pole in the city 
scott brown spokesman for the state department of game and 
fish said the release went off without a hitch thursday afternoon 
in the sandia mountains east of here the cub was released first 
then his mother 
officers from the new mexico department of game and fish us 
forest service and zoo officials assisted in the release 
when the mother bear saw them all she just took off brown 
said she stopped after she got about 25 yards away he said until 
the cub caught up with her 
she looked back at all the people and started wandering up the 
hill like she should brown said 
i guess our last hope is that they are going to mind their 
business now stay up there stay out of trouble said dr bret 
snyder veterinarian at the rio grande zoological park 
brown said the mother bear was fitted with a radio collar so 
biologists can monitor her for the next couple of weeks 
the mother bear had wandered into albuquerques residential 
northeast heights last aug 14 and climbed a 25foot utility pole 
when wildlife officials shot her with a tranquilizer gun she fell 
brushing a transformer and causing the shock and burns pictures of 
the dramatic fall was broadcast nationally 
the cub had been captured in town the previous day 
the bears were taken to the zoo and slowly reintroduced to each 
other to protect the injured female she had suffered extensive 
damage to her skin and muscles on her hind legs 
on her right hind leg the bone was exposed but it healed over 
snyder said she did maintain enough use of that leg that we 
really cant tell that she has any disability to speak of he 
added 
the bears were kept in a medical unit at the zoo until 
middecember when they were moved to a quarteracre fenced area 
with cottonwood trees and a den the bears also dug an outside den 
under some concrete snyder said 
the mother bear weighed 104 pounds when brought in for 
treatment but was up to 188 pounds thursday he said the cub grew 
from 15 pounds to 108 pounds hes fat but hes also matured a 
lot snyder said 
he said zoo crews tried to keep contact with the animals to a 
minimum 
when they sensed humans they went into the dens so we didnt 
see them at all for several weeks he said they only came out 
at night we thought that was a good sign that they were staying 
wild 
albuquerque was invaded by 19 bears last summer drought 
apparently caused a food shortage in the mountains sending the 
bears into the city

president bush said today he sent a personal 
message to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to make sure the 
soviets understand our position on lithuania 
i do not want to risk misunderstanding by failing to 
communicate bush said 
the president sent a personal message to the soviet leader on 
thursday night appealing for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in 
the seccesionist baltic republic white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
later speaking with reporters during a picturetaking session 
bush said i want to be sure the soviets understand our position 
and understand that were not trying to make things difficult for 
lithuania or the soviet uniion or anybody else bush said 
he said he had not yet heard back from gorbachev but indicated 
that he expected some form of reply bush declined to disclose the 
contents of his message calling it confidential 
asked why he decided to contact gorbachev directly bush cited 
the importance of staying in touch and being sure there is no 
disconnect because of misinformation 
it was bushs first effort at direct contact with the soviet 
leader since tensions began escalating with the march 11 lithuanian 
declaration of independence 
in the letter to gorbachev bush clearly stated his support 
and the american support for the aspirations of the lithuanian 
people for selfdetermination fitzwater said 
we have expressed our belief and our emphatic view that a 
resolution of this conflict lies in peaceful dialogue fitzwater 
said 
the presidents message to president gorbachev simply 
reaffirmed our position as stated many times fitzwater said 
the spokesman said bushs letter was sent via diplomatic 
channels thursday evening 
he wanted to be certain our position was understood 
fitzwater said 
fitzwater also said that sen edward m kennedy dmass had 
met with bush in the white house on thursday to report on the 
senators trip to moscow and meeting with gorbachev kennedys 
halfhour report to bush on the trip was a factor in the 
presidents decision to write a letter to gorbachev fitzwater said 
fitzwater said bushs letter was delivered to officials at the 
soviet embassy in washington which relayed it to moscow 
it came a day after fitzwater said bush simply feels that this 
is not the time for direct contact with the soviet leader 
today the spokesman said i was not aware of any intent to do 
it on thursday morning but that bush decided to do it and just 
did it 
the president felt that last night was the right time to send 
a personal written message that clearly laid out our position 
fitzwater said 
the bush administration had treaded carefully on the lithuanian 
subject voicing support for the selfdetermination rights of 
citizens of the rebellious baltic republic while urging restraint 
on both sides 
the united states has never recognized the 1940 forced 
incorporation of lithuania into the soviet union but neither has 
it extended formal diplomatic recognition to the secessionist state 
fitzwater said that an accumulation of information and 
feedback had prompted the president to feel that this was the 
time for a personal message that used his words and that president 
gorbachev knew came directly from him 
fitzwater said this feedback included bushs meeting with 
kennedy his phone call on wednesday to british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and contacts between secretary of state james a 
baker iii and his soviet counterpart soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze 
administration officials have repeatedly cautioned that use of 
force by moscow in blocking lithuanian independence would backfire 
and could damage ussoviet relations 
but bush has come under pressure from some members of congress 
for not being more aggressive in complaining about soviet actions 
in the breakaway republic 
while acknowledging the criticism fitzwater today said we 
believe our supporters far outnumber our critics on this issue 
on recent developments in lithuania fitzwater said we have 
not seen too many episodes the last few days that have been very 
dramatic but the problem is not resolved theyre still searching 
for solutions and we hope that can be worked out 
fitzwater said bush welcomed kennedys firsthand report even 
though generally speaking we never feel that great about 
senators doing their own foreign policy 
the spokesman said that no attempts had been made to contact 
directly the rebellious lithuanian leaders citing the lack of any 
formal ties with the vilnius government 
however he said that contact with lithuanian leaders by some 
us citizens and uslithuanian groups here had been generally 
helpful in indirectly getting across us policy views to 
lithuanians 
our interest is not in making threats and not in doing any 
damage to the situation but in being positive and constructive 
fitzwater said 
we want to be helpful in resolving this process we dont want 
to do any harm he added

ten years ago this weekend graduate 
student aaron lansky rented a modest loft took out corporation 
papers and launched an ambitious mission rescuing yiddish 
literature from extinction 
everybodys best guess was that there were about 75000 
volumes still extant here we are a million books later and still 
going strong he said there was no way to have imagined how 
prolific jews were as writers and readers 
now the founder of the national yiddish book center is turning 
to the business of trying to disseminate the thousands of books 
written in the language spoken by eastern european jews for 
hundreds of years and nearly erased in the holocaust 
our first 10 years was devoted to collecting and distributing 
books now well branch out and begin doing a great more he 
said our premise is now weve collected all these books weve 
got to open them up and let the world know whats inside of them 
lansky 33 has moved the center to nearby amherst and 
established a warehouse about 10 miles away in holyoke to hold the 
thousands of books sent in including some that were rescued from 
trash bins or plucked from attics 
in december he traveled to the soviet unions baltic states 
responding to letters from jews who hoped president mikhail 
gorbachevs reforms would mean a return for yiddish 
it was a pretty grueling experience in many ways he said 
what we found was that yiddish was not widely spoken in russia 
proper there is really what amounts to 70 years of assimilation 
lansky hopes to work out a system of shipping books to stockholm 
and then taking them personally into the soviet union 
the international venture goes far beyond the hopes he had as a 
student of yiddish who wanted to collect fodder for his research 
collecting the books was a big undertaking for us weve 
collected almost 1 million volumes which no one would have thought 
possible surprisingly enough theyre still coming in lansky 
said 
the nonprofit center has a staff of about two dozen and runs 
educational and cultural programs including the yiddish library 
development program about 70 libraries are participating 
including yale university which has a collection of 70000 yiddish 
books from the center 
the center celebrated its 10th anniversary quietly holding a 
fourday film series in northampton where the venture began 
lansky said the decade has seen a resurgence of interest in 
yiddish 
really what were doing is picking up the remnants of a 
shattered past he said were right at the nexus of two worlds 
where the last of a yiddishspeaking generation is passing on my 
generation is the last generation whose grandparents spoke yiddish 
theres really a great deal of urgency in all this

the department of housing and urban 
developments inspector general confirmed friday he is 
investigating a new agency whose director gave nobid contracts to 
three friends from the reagan administration 
however inspector general paul a adams declined comment on an 
account from a department source who said the preliminary effort 
found contract irregularities at the new federal housing 
finance board which controls millions of dollars in federal 
housing aid 
the agency whose embattled director has been clashing with top 
aides to hud secretary jack kemp is independent of hud but has 
remained under kemps control for seven months because he is its 
only named board member 
the agency was created as part of the savings and loan bailout 
plan to oversee the 12 regional federal home loan banks which 
must give up 400 million of their profits each year to help pay 
for the thrift bailout the regional banks also must put a 
percentage of their profits each year into affordable housing 
programs starting with 78 million this year and rising to 100 
million 
kemp spent several hours meeting thursday with the women he 
recruited to head the agency mary k bush who was a treasury 
department official during the reagan administration 
among the recipients of the nobid contracts were 
wendell gunn who worked for reagan and also served for 
several months last year as kemps chief of staff at hud 
margery waxman an attorney who after leaving treasury helped 
charles keating try to fend off sampl regulators who wanted to seize 
his troubled california thrift keatings lincoln savings and loan 
later failed at an estimated eventual cost to taxpayers of 25 
billion 
the third went to a consulting firm whose partners include 
another former treasury official 
kemp aides said friday that he had not been aware of any of the 
nobid contracts until last week or of any financial arrangement 
between gunn and the housing finance board 
gunn has said he informed kemp late last year and hud 
undersecretary alfred a dellibovi in a memo to several top kemp 
aides last month listed wendell as being among those being 
paid by the agency 
adams the inspector general said he began the investigation at 
kemps request and on monday took possession of housing finance 
board records he said agency officials were cooperating 
he declined to answer questions about specifics of his review 
but said he hoped to issue a final report to kemp next week 
a department source speaking only on the condition of 
anonymity said the preliminary findings showed that all board 
contract awards followed accepted procedures except the three to 
ms bushs friends 
ms bush was not available for comment her spokesman joseph 
slye said she had taken the day off and was out of town she has 
asked attorney peter wallison a former reagan administration 
attorney with whom she worked at treasury to represent her in the 
investigation wallisons office said he was out of town and not 
available for comment ms bush through slye said last week that 
she had the power to issue nobid contracts and did so because the 
agency was shortstaffed and needed to get up and running 
kemps decision to call in adams is the latest development in a 
behindthescenes struggle between ms bush and top kemp deputies 
publicly kemp and others at hud have maintained their support of 
ms bush but one of the housing secretarys top deputies said 
nearly two months ago in a memo to other kemp aides that he hoped 
she would leave 
in his feb 5 memo obtained by the associated press dellibovi 
said wendell had told a new agency employee he wanted to soon 
leave the housing finance board 
if he goes lets hope he takes mary is how dellibovi 
concluded the memo 
among the six kemp aides to whom it was addressed was mary 
brunette kemps closest adviser 
she said friday she did not recall ever reading the memo 
to my knowledge the secretary was not aware of any contractual 
relationship or financial relationship between wendell gunn and the 
federal housing finance board ms brunette said if i became 
aware of such a relationship i would have told him 
but gunn in an angry letter to dellibovi this week said the 
secretary did in fact know i was being paid for my work and if you 
ask he will tell you so in fact in late november i offered to 
end the arrangement retroactively giving up all accrued 
compensation if the secretary thought there was even the 
appearance of a problem

separate nations of erecting trade barriers against us products

against countries that refuse to open their doors to american goods 
the accusations were included in the 1990 edition of the 
national trade report on foreign trade barriers 
japan which accounts for almost of half of americas 109 
billion trade deficit was singled out for having more barriers 
than any other country accounting for 19 pages 216 page report 
south korea was the second worst offender with 10 pages of alleged 
infractions 
todays report was the first step in drawing up a list of 
priority countries the administration will target for intensive 
negotiations aimed at getting the offending trade barriers 
eliminated 
that priority list is due on april 30 
the requirement for a target list of countries was the most 
controversial section of the 1988 trade law 
in addition to japan and south korea 33 other nations and two 
trading blocks were singled out for barriers against us products 
the other countries were argentina australia brazil canada 
chile china colombia egypt west germany finland france

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
bounced back 18 percent in february from their steepest dive in 16 
years a month earlier the government said friday 
still orders were running below the levels posted late last 
year 
analysts said the report was more evidence of sluggishness in 
the industrial sector of the economy but also found signs 
indicating improvement ahead 
manufacturing is aimlessly drifting along on a plateau 
robert g dederick chief economist for the northern trust co in 
chicago said of the report the minirecession in manufacturing 
is still there 
evalina tainer senior economist for the first national bank of 
chicago agreed but added that the report suggests the 
manufacturing sector has bottomed out and we could be a little bit 
on the mend 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2316 billion 
after plummeting 55 percent in january the steepest drop since a 
7 percent decline in december 1974 
januarys plunge was even deeper than the 54 percent reported 
last month 
but while the february rebound was not back to prejanuary 
levels dederick and ms tainer saw signs of optimism in a category 
often used in measuring future business investment plans 
capital goods orders less aircraft are looking a little firmer 
than they did before dederick said theyre showing some signs 
of underlying support to the expansion im not saying strength 
but weakness is not developing 
commerce said nondefense capital goods orders less aircraft 
rose 22 percent in february durable goods orders advanced 26 
percent 
durable goods orders expensive items expected to last more 
than three years have been affected most by the federal reserves 
highinterest policies because they often are financed by loans 
the department said durable goods orders were concentrated in 
transportation equipment up 104 percent to 299 billion 
transportation orders had led the overall january decline with a 
drop of 294 percent 
nondurable goods orders rose 09 percent to 1107 billion the 
largest increases were in food and printing and publishing 
defense orders which often are volatile shot ahead 217 
percent to 79 billion after falling 336 percent the previous 
month excluding defense orders were up 12 percent

panamas vice president guillermo ford called 
at the israeli embassy friday to smooth over differences resulting 
from israels past ties with deposed military leader gen manuel 
noriega and to propose joint economic projects 
ford in the united states to lobby for economic aid to panama 
met with ambassador moshe arad and david turgeman head of the 
israeli foreign ministrys latin american bureau said spokeswoman 
ruth yaron 
ford said his government was determined to forgive and move 
on yaron said 
fords comment refers to tensions between the two countries over 
israels close links to noriega before he was ousted last december 
by a us invasion force and brought to miami to stand trial on 
drug trafficking charges 
israel had trained noriegas personal bodyguards and its defense 
industries had several lucrative contracts with panama noriega 
owned property in israel and had sent his daughters there several 
times 
one of noriegas closest advisers was mike harari a former 
operative of the mossad intelligence agency who turned to private 
business in latin america 
the idea of the israeli meeting with ford was proposed during 
talks turgeman held this week with undersecretary of state robert 
kimmitt yaron said 
the panamanian embassy confirmed the meeting took place but 
could not immediately provide details 
panama is anxious to rebuild its economy shattered by a us 
boycott of the country under noriega and by the invasion itself 
ford and the israeli diplomats agreed that israel would provide 
panama with expertise on agricultural projects and on rebuilding 
the countrys medical system yaron said 
since neither israel nor panama have money for such projects 
the united states may fund them she said 
ford also was invited to visit israel she said

thousands of slovaks rallied 
friday to protest the countrys new name which does not have a 
hyphen to distinguish slovaks from the dominant czechs 
the national parliament voted thursday night to drop the 
socialist designation from the countrys name and call the 
nation the czechoslovak federative republic that set off daylong 
protests in bratislava the capital of the slovak republic 
parliament agreed to allow the slovaks to write the new name 
with a hyphen but the slovaks wanted legislators to approve 
czechoslovak republic as the proper name of the country 
tension had been building for weeks between czechs and slovaks 
over the issue the spontaneous protest friday began outside the 
slovak parliament building and then moved to a central bratislava 
square 
chanting long live slovakia the crowd applauded speakers 
who asserted that the czechs who make up about twothirds of 
czechoslovakias 155 million people had ridden roughshod over the 
interests of the slovaks some even carried banners calling for a 
sovereign slovak state 
slovakias parliament unanimously passed a resolution demanding 
talks involving the federal parliament and the leaderships of the 
czech and slovak republics on the name issue 
civic forum and public against violence the movements that led 
last winters peaceful revolution against communism appealed for 
an end to the strife 
it seems the time when we could be proud of what we have 
achieved has ended said jan urban leader of civic forum 
the row developed after president vaclav havel a czech 
suggested in january that czechoslovakia follow poland and hungary 
and drop the designation socialist from its formal title of 
czechoslovak socialist republic 
the slovaks suggested a hyphen be inserted in the new name to 
set them apart from the czechs but the hyphen suggestion was 
firmly rejected by the dominant czech deputies and by some 
slovaks when the federal parliament voted thursday 
slovakia became a republic in 1969 the division into czech and 
slovak republics meant that slovakia got onehalf of most federal 
resources 
slovak television and czech radio both broadcast the rally for 
awhile slovak television abruptly halted the transmission after a 
few minutes czech radio broadcast remarks by an unidentified 
speaker but then cut off the transmission saying it could not

technology for cleaning up a spill the size of 
the one caused by the exxon valdez was marginal to begin with and 
hasnt improved in the year since the accident says a government 
report released friday 
sen ted stevens ralaska said the study shows that the 
government should create more incentives to study how to clean up 
oil 
this report will be used to urge more investment in research 
and development said stevens as he released the study from 
congress office of technology assessment he suggested tax law 
changes to give industry more incentive to do the research 
he also said pending legislation authorizes 28 million annually 
for national research into spill cleanup and 23 million over a 
10year period for the prince william sound oil spill institute 
the prince william sound research would include a decadelong 
study of the impact of exxons nearly 11 million gallon crude oil 
spill last year on alaskas natural environment 
however both industry and government should be focusing first 
on prevention said stevens 
short of eliminating oil transportation at sea no perfect 
solution to the problem of offshore oil spills exists said the 
ota oil spills will occur again and the catastrophic ones will 
never be cleaned up satisfactorily the proverbial ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure 
stevens said legislation passed by both the house and senate and 
now in conference has safety provisions designed to reduce the 
number of spills 
the senator said he is certain a bill will be passed this year 
but its currently stalled in the conference committee because of 
differences between the senate and the house over certain 
provisions including whether tankers should be required to have 
double hulls and bottoms

mean some hospitals would have to close down or cut back on 
services unless doctors are willing to work overtime for no extra 
pay 
doctors salaries are indexed to rise automatically with 
inflation currently at 15 percent but kyriakos eleftheriadis

for the drunken driver and the parents of 
the teenage girl he killed 1 a week is the price for getting on 
with the rest of their lives 
i told the kid facetoface if you want to get on with your 
life and never see me again just put a dollar in the mail every 
friday said louis herzog 
susan herzog was 18 when she was killed on new years day 1982 
kevin tunell was 17 so his case went to juvenile court where he 
was convicted of manslaughter and drunken driving 
louis and patricia herzog filed a 15 million suit against 
tunell but settled for 936 to be paid 1 at a time to remind 
tunell what he had done to their daughter 
tunell now 26 keeps missing his payments the herzogs keep 
taking him to court 
he was sentenced thursday in fairfax county circuit court to 30 
days in jail for contempt because he has not lived up to his 
agreement to make the weekly payments circuit judge jack b 
stevens allowed him 30 days to appeal 
testifying thursday tunell said he is haunted by susan herzogs 
death and tormented by the payments 
its like im not purposely not writing them because i want to 
defy the court and im trying to hurt the herzogs i just dont 
feel good it hurts he said weeping 
this was the fourth time in eight years that the herzogs both 
active in mothers against drunk driving have been to court trying 
to enforce the dollaraweek agreement 
as his criminal sentence tunell was ordered to spend a year 
talking to groups about the evils of drunken driving he completed 
that sentence he said and continued to campaign against drunken 
driving for the next six years 
tunell declined friday to talk about the case 
i think its pretty evident whats going on i think people 
will understand why i dont want to talk tunell said by 
telephone from his parents home in fairfax i just want to get 
on with my life 
tunnels lawyer stan klein also declined to answer questions 
but read a statement 
kevin and his family hope that this tragedy of over eight 
years ago can be left to the families that have suffered as a 
result of it as they will have to continue to live with it for the 
rest of their lives the statement said 
the 1 payments are due each friday because susan died on a 
friday they began in 1982 and will end in 2000 one year for 
every year susan lived 
the agreement specifies that payments are to be made by check 
made out to susan herzog her parents deposit the money in a 
scholarship fund at virginia tech earmarked for students from 
robinson high school where their daughter was a senior 
from the witness stand thursday tunell offered the herzogs two 
boxes of checks covering payments until 2001 one year more than 
required they refused 
what we want is to receive that check every week on time 
mrs herzog said he must understand we are going to pursue this 
until august of the year 2000 we will go back to court every month 
if we have to 
the couple say they have no sympathy for drunken drivers a 
second daughter deborah was hit by a drunken driver in 1987 the 
florida accident crushed deborah herzogs legs and she now walks 
with a permanent limp 
judge stevens while ruling tunell in contempt questioned the 
parents persistence 
its been said to err is human but to forgive is divine 
stevens said 
i suppose to forgive is divine but unfortunately lou herzog 
is just an average guy herzog said friday 
were always asked why are we doing this why are we trying to 
ruin this boys life he said were not vindictive were not 
trying to destroy this young man all we want is what we agreed to 
were getting on with our lives and we want him to get on with

josie cruz natori once a wall street investment 
banker is heading back to new york as avantgarde designer trying 
to bring underwear out of the closet and into the fashion spotlight 
her first fullscale show opens in manhattan on wednesday and 
she admits to some nervousness you never know how critics will 
react said the diminutive philippineborn american 
mrs natori 43 has been building a solid business and 
reputation in the lingerie field for 10 years and now feels its 
time to go bigtime 
i dont want my fashion to be categorized i almost hate the 
word lingerie to describe it she said escorting a model 
wearing a luxurious gold charmeuse satin sheath and embroidered 
velvet cape out of her paris bedroom 
her career has gone from boardroom to bedroom and now to 
ballroom she entered the investment banking business in 1968 and 
in 1976 became the first woman vice president of merrill lynch 
i simply wanted to build my own business and fell into the 
design field almost by accident said mrs natori who grew up in 
manila 
i was researching a business i could start based on filipino 
artisans skills so in 1977 a friend sent me some 
filipinoembroidered blouses 
a buyer at bloomingdales saw a blouse and told mrs natori 
make it into a nightshirt 
i ddnt even know what a nightshirt was said mrs natori 
but she was soon enthusiastically turning out nightshirts not to 
mention sexy merry widows bedjackets 
she later expanded into embroidered mules ballerina 
slippers and appliqued bathroom linens plus a line of toiletries 
from an initial outlay of 10000 her company has grown into a 
25 million business her husband of 17 years ken natori recently 
quit his wall street job with a sixfigure salary to help manage 
the operation 
i couldnt have done this without my familys support though 
they thought i was crazy to leave a good financial job said mrs 
natori she credits her fathers acumen for her business flair and 
her mothers artistic eye for her design talents 
but women in the philippines are strong managers too added 
mrs natori my grandmother was nicknamed supreme commander and 
my mother was commander in chief 
mrs natori was educated at a catholic school in manila then 
attended manhattanville college in new york 
her first job at bache and co in 1968 took her right back to 
the philippines to open a new office 
returning to new york she was just into a new job with merrill 
lynch in 1971 when she met her future husband the natoris now have 
a 14yearold son and what mrs natori calls a rare workandhome 
relationship 
paris is the soul side of me said mrs natori who 
manufactures both in the united states and the philippines but 
gravitates to the french capital 
she opened her first freestanding shop at the prestigious place 
vendome in paris two years ago and i come back for fashion 
stimulation and relaxation whenever i can she said 
but she takes fashion with a grain of salt there is too much 
emphasis on categories like sportswear office wear lingerie 
she said 
im primarily interested in making a good product that people 
will buy something thats different that you can wear to dress up 
at home or go out in she said thats the philosophy of my 
clothes that have grown out of underwear 
she feels many highstyle clothes are overpriced her recent 
goldembroidered velvet cape retails for about 1200 
she says her first fashion show will be modest featuring just 
60 select models though she regularly turns out five lines a year 
of about 350 pieces each 
can she draw yes but i have seven assistants as well and 
our total staff is about 700 
mrs natori is an accomplished pianist and on request sat down 
to execute a chopin nocturne on her paris concert steinway later 
at a party for fashion people she played musical comedy songs by 
ear as her guests sang along 
her professional passion is business not fashion she said i 
cant take it too seriously i design what id like to wear myself 
and hope it flies

baldheaded men and mothers who bear five or 
more children develop blood cholesterol patterns that might raise 
their risk of heart disease according to studies released friday 
in a study of 872 electronics factory workers in italy dr 
maurizio trevisan found blood cholesterol and blood pressure levels 
rose with age among the 278 men with malepattern baldness 
they defined that as a receding hairline and a bald spot on the 
crown of the head 
the small but significant increases werent found among the 321 
men with full heads of hair or the 273 with receding hairlines but 
not a balding crown said trevisan an epidemiologist at the state 
university of new york at buffalo 
the study released at an american heart association meeting is 
reason to lose one more hair john capps founder of baldheaded 
men of america said by phone from morehead city nc maybe we 
need to put our heads together on it and work out a solution 
trevisan and colleagues at the university of naples plan 
research on whether elevated cholesterol and blood pressure levels 
actually make bald men more prone to heart attack and stroke 
if these data are confirmed they could be at higher risk 
he said right now i have no idea these elevated levels 
are not numbers that place these men in a very highrisk category 
for developing coronary heart disease but this may change as the 
men age 
if elevated blood pressure and cholesterol also are found in 
other populations trevisans study would be considered a 
breakthrough observation said dr elizabeth barrettconnor 
chairwoman of community and family medicine at the university of 
california san diego 
barrettconnor coauthored the study of multiple pregnancies 
in her study of 1275 women in rancho bernardo near san diego 
she found that the women who had at least five pregnancies had a 
nearly 8 percent drop in levels of highdensity lipoprotein which 
is believed to protect against heart disease there was no drop in 
the socalled good cholesterol among women with fewer children 
pregnancy may be another risk for heart disease but it does 
not show up until five or more said barrettconnors colleague 
donna kritzsilverstein 
like the bald men the women with five or more kids havent been 
followed long enough to know if they actually will develop higher 
heart disease rates they were studied for 10 years since their 
most recent pregnancies 
im not going to recommend women do family planning based on 
this single study said barrettconnor i would tell a woman 
who had five or more kids her hdl is the least of her troubles 
kritzsilverstein said several but not all studies have 
reported an increased risk of cardiovascular disease among women 
who have been pregnant and decreased highdensity lipoprotein 
levels may be one explanation 
also friday university of iowa scientists said they found 
sixth through eighthgrade children had significantly lower 
good cholesterol levels if one or both parents smoked at home 
daily or if the child chewed tobacco weekly or smoked cigarettes 
monthly 
aside from lung disease the possible heart disease link is 
another reason for parents who smoke to think seriously about the 
toxic effect their habit has on their children said dr paul 
pomrehn the studys author 
highdensity lipoprotein or hdl hooks onto cholesterol in 
blood carrying the fatty substance to the liver for disposal so it 
wont clog arteries and cause heart attacks and strokes 
in the baldness study all the men had similar cholesterol and 
blood pressure levels when the research started in 1975 but those 
with malepattern baldness developed high levels as they grew older 
and lost hair by 1987 they averaged blood cholesterol levels of 
214 milligrams per deciliter compared with 208 for nonbald men 
and men with only receding hairlines 
trevisan and barrettconnor speculated hormone changes 
accompanying balding and pregnancy might cause the cholesterol 
patterns they found those patterns existed even after accounting 
for individual differences in age weight and obesity and 
cigarette and alcohol consumption

soviet troops occupied lithuanias 
prosecutors office today after its staff members refused to take 
orders from a new chief prosecutor appointed by moscow lithuanian 
officials said 
if the report is confirmed it would be the first time soviet 
soldiers have taken control of a lithuanian government building 
since the baltic republic defied moscow and declared its 
independence on march 11 
the report came several hours after the white house announced 
that president bush had called for a peaceful resolution of the 
lithuanian crisis 
the trouble began at the prosecutors office earlier today when 
moscow officials fired lithuanias chief prosecutor in a bid to 
make the republic adhere to soviet law then tried to intall new 
prosecutor of their choosing 
the move failed when the offices employees said they would 
remain loyal to their former boss the dispute became a standoff 
with both chief prosecutors trying to run the office at the same 
time 
several hours later soldiers of the soviet interior ministry 
took over the building with the help of one employee egidius 
bickauskas a lithuanian legislator said on the republics 
television he did not elaborate 
he accused the soviet union of violating the republics 
sovereignty 
a lithuanian interior ministry spokesman confirmed that soviet 
soldiers were inside the prosecutors office he also said the 
soldiers had moved into the institute of party history 
a foreign journalist who rushed to the scene said he saw a 
truckload of soviet interior ministry soldiers enter the building 
soldiers previously had occupied a handful of communist party 
buildings in lithuania but today was the first time they 
reportedly occupied a lithuanian government building 
also today the kgb pledged to protect lithuanian citizens who 
cooperate with it in enforcing soviet law the statement 
distributed by the tass news agency called illegal a resolution 
passed tuesday by lithuanias legislature saying kgb informers 
risk being punished and having their names published 
before todays reported occupation moscows tactics had 
included shows of military force the arrest of army deserters and 
orders for foreigners to leave and for residents to turn in their 
guns 
in response to a kremlin demand for a referendum lithuania on 
thursday offered to hold a public vote on whether to rejoin the 
soviet union 
the white house said today that president bush sent a letter to 
president mikhail s gorbachev calling for a peaceful resolution in 
lithuania 
the letter sent via diplomatic channels on thursday stated 
bushs suppot and the american support for the aspirations of the 
lithuanian people for selfdetermination presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
we have expressed our belief and our emphatic view that a 
resolution of this conflict lies in peaceful dialogue fitzwater 
said of the letter 
on thursday the lithuanian prosecutors office ordered police 
not to carry out gorbachevs order to confiscate firearms that 
citizens had not surrendered lithuanian police had already refused 
the standoff began at the office when moscow officials tried to 
replace arturis paulauskas the prosecutor appointed by the 
lithuanian government on march 22 soviet deputy prosecutor alexei 
vasiliev told more than 100 members of the lithuanian prosecutors 
staff to execute soviet law he brought with him an ethnic 
lithuanian antanas petrauskas to replace paulauskas 
tass later carried a statement from soviet prosecutor general 
alexander sukharev firing paulauskas and officially naming 
petrauskas as his successor 
staff members reacted during the meeting with angry questions 
do you know our government was elected legally one employee 
shouted 
bickauskas the lithuanian legislator told the staff 
i hope you will consider your place is in your offices under 
the leadership of mr paulauskas nearly everyone applauded as 
they rose to leave the room and returned to their their desks 
you must obey the orders of the general prosecutor of the 
ussr vasiliev said in a raised voice as people left but his 
appeal had little effect until the building was taken over later 
vasiliev told a handful of reporters after he was ignored that 
his 11member team from moscow is not an instrument of force 
and that his next step in the struggle would be a legal one he 
would not elaborate 
paulauskas back in his office said i am the prosecutor of 
lithuania and i will stay here until force is used against me 
foreign reporters attended the meeting although the press corps 
in vilnius has dwindled since soviet authorities barred foreigners 
from lithuania and refused to extend permission to stay for 
correspondents already there 
foreign journalists in the soviet union are all based in moscow 
and must get permission to travel outside the capital and state the 
length of their stay as their departure dates arrive reporters 
have been leaving vilnius 
lithuania wants back the independence it enjoyed before being 
crushed by the soviet union in 1940 along with the two other baltic 
republics of estonia and latvia a stalinhitler pact gave the 
soviets control over the republics

massive doses of a steroid drug given within 
hours of a spinal cord injury can significantly reduce paralysis 
for patients who previously had seemed beyond help a government 
study reported friday 
the study conducted at 10 centers around the united states 
proved that the drug methylprednisolone was able to restore some 
feeling and movement in virtually all spinal cord injury patients 
marking the first time that an effective treatment for such 
paralyzing injuries has been found federal officials said 
we now know that paralysis after spinal cord injury can be 
reduced by early treatment said michael b bracken a professor 
at the yale university school of medicine who directed the study 
we were never certain about that before this study 
clinical trials of the drug involved 487 spinal injury patients 
the study compared the results of 162 treated with 
methylprednisolone with 154 treated with naloxone and 171 who 
received a placebo 
the results said bracken show that methylprednisolone is an 
effective treatment for reducing some of the neurological damage of 
a spinal injury 
officials who monitored the study said its results could have an 
important effect on the lives of some 10000 americans annually who 
suffer acute spinal cord injury automobile accidents are the most 
common source of such injuries 
most such injuries occur in men under the age of 30 and most 
such patients will spend their lives permanently disabled 
methylprednisolone has been used for years to treat shock to 
prevent swelling of the brain from injury or stroke and to 
stabilize membranes after injury for the spinal injury study 
researchers at the clinical centers gave patients 10 to 100 times 
the normal dosage within a 23hour period 
the result said bracken is that virtually all patients 
receiving the drug improved to some degree the improvement was 
significantly greater than for patients with similar injuries who 
received other treatment 
bracken said the study results have been evaluated by reviewers 
and will be published in may in the new england journal of 
medicine he said the announcement was made in advance of 
publication in hopes that patients can benefit immediately 
federal officials said doctors may obtain information about 
treatment with the drug by calling 3014965751 during working 
hours weekends the number to call is 8006333425 
the drug works only if it is given within eight hours after a 
spinal cord injury about 95 percent of all spinal cord patients 
are admitted to hospitals within eight hours which means that most 
can benefit from this therapy bracken said 
some patients in the study reported remarkable and unexpected 
recovery from serious spinal injuries 
in phoenix doctors credit the drug with saving denise shoblom 
owner of several arizona broadcast outlets from possible paralysis 
ms shoblom was taken to kingman regional medical center in 
august 1989 following an auto accident doctors there injected 
methylprednisolone on the recommendation of doctors at barrow 
neurological institute one of the centers taking part in the 
federal study 
just after the accident ms shoblom had no feeling in her 
limbs but she is now walking on her own and hopes to make a 
complete recovery 
because this medication was given to her within eight hours of 
her injury she was able to recover much of her motor function 
said dr volker sonntag of barrow if it hadnt been for this 
medication she might be completely paralyzed today 
much of the improvement seen among patients receiving the 
medication was much more subtle bracken said 
among quadriplegics he said the improvement might mean that a 
patient would be able to use a hand that without the drug would 
have been paralyzed for those who might have had paralyzed legs 
said bracken the improvement could mean that they would be able to 
transfer themselves from wheelchair to car or that they would be 
able to walk with crutches 
some he said were able to leave wheelchairs permanently 
precisely how the drug works is still not clear 
dr william f collins chairman of the surgery department at 
yale said that medical science has long believed that the 
paralyzing effects of spinal injuries actually occur only as an 
indirect result of the trauma itself 
he said it is believed that injured nerve cells release a 
substance that damages adjacent cells and nerve fiber causing 
paralysis to set in 
its sort of a cascade that continues for several hours after 
the injury said collins massive doses of methylprednisolone 
alters that cascade and then protects those adjacent cells 
and fibers 
the study was supported by the national institute of 
neurological disorders and stroke one of the national institutes 
of health 
the clinical centers taking part in the study were yale 
university school of medicine new haven conn medical university 
of south carolina charleston new york university bellevue medical 
center new york university of texas medical branch galveston 
baylor university college of medicine houston barrow neurological 
institute phoenix university of california san diego harborview

it dont make no difference if 
prosecutors go after criminals with indictments that use bad 
grammar the states highest court said in a ruling that may help 
perpetuate generations of language abuse by lawyers 
convicted arsonist leon corson sr said he should have been 
cleared because the indictment against him was so poorly written 
and ambiguous that it made no sense 
the indictment returned by grand jurors in piscataquis county 
contained a 180word sentence that takes up 14 lines on the page 
it said in part that with the intent that conduct be performed 
which in fact would constitute a crime or crimes the fire in 
question was set 
the maine supreme judicial courts five justices did not buy 
corsons arguments saying the indictment even though 
grammatically incorrect adequately informs the defendant of the 
nature of the charge against him 
this weeks ruling came as no surprise to scholars of english 
who said friday that lawyers are among the worst language offenders 
a 180word sentence should be taken out and be shot said 
richard lederer a columnist and language author from concord nh 
it is disgraceful theyre trying to protect somebodys rights 
and its very tough to do with a 180word sentence even if its 
180 simple words 
at the university of southern maine assistant professor of 
english willard rusch said most lawyers should plead guilty to 
using fossilized phrases in english that people dont use 
sentences of that type are written according to outdated rules 
of grammar and theyre difficult for people to understand rusch 
said possibly the person has a real good complaint 
the justices didnt see it that way although they pointed out 
that maine law insists an indictment shall be a plain concise 
and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting 
the offense charged 
that may well be too much to ask of lawyers 
they often use complex sentences decorated with such phrases as 
to wit whereas and aforementioned as well as 
numerous bits of latin in an attempt to show they are a special 
educated class of people scholars say 
they wont call a spade a spade lederer said they call 
it an excavation device it sometimes sounds more important 
anyone who winds up being indicted with such confusing language 
can always get it translated into regular english but the 
translation will come from yet another lawyer he said

the prosecutor at john poindexters 
irancontra trial said today in closing arguments that evidence 
against the former national security adviser is overwhelming and 
that poindexter directed oliver north to lie to congress 
but poindexters defense attorney told the jury that poindexter 
was a victim caught in a political battle between congress and 
the white house and was not part of a coverup conspiracy 
poindexter is accused of concealing from congress norths secret 
military assistance to the contras and the us role in a november 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran his case is expected to go 
to the jury next week after four weeks of testimony 
in his closing arguments today prosecutor dan webb said the 
jury must convict poindexter because the boss cant escape legal 
responsibility just because he didnt get his hands dirty 
webb said poindexter generally instructed north to go to a 
meeting with congressmen and lie by denying he was assisting the 
contras militarily 
north was there because the defendant on trial in this case 
his commander sent him there to do that said webb 
but poindexters attorney richard beckler told the jurors that 
the only real victim as a result of this political battle is 
admiral john poindexter 
poindexter did his everloving best to give as much 
information as he could tell to congress said the lawyer 
poindexter was not part of some grimy little conspiracy as 
the prosecution would have you believe said beckler he was 
working for the president of the united states 
webb said that if the jurors sat in 1000 cases they would 
never find evidence more powerful and more convincing it is 
overwhelming 
the defense witnesses included former president reagan who webb 
said didnt have the slightest clue whether john poindexter did 
or did not participate in the crimes he is accused of committing 
a presidential document which poindexter tore up is the one 
document that puts the lie to a speech reagan gave on nov 13 
1986 webb said in it reagan asserted that we did not trade 
weapons for hostages 
you dont lie to the american public webb said of reagan 
the prosecutor at one point tore up a copy of the document in front 
of the jury to dramatize what poindexter had done 
poindexter destroyed the document hours after telling congress 
on nov 21 1986 that the president hadnt approved a shipment of 
hawk missiles to iran in november 1986 the document signed by 
reagan called a finding depicted a swap of arms for hostages 
in two days of videotaped testimony reagan was questioned by 
defense attorney beckler about his various meetings with foreign 
leaders in support of the nicaraguan contras 
for the life of me i could not understand what that had to do 
with the issues in this case said webb 
webb said he became a little bit angry when reagan winked at 
poindexter during his testimony as if to say did that last 
answer help you john 
i would have expected more of a former president said webb 
webb said the defense had engaged in a scatter gun lets 
throw mud against the wall lets see what happens approach 
that type of defense insults your intelligence webb told 
the jury 
when the defense rested tuesday after calling 15 witnesses webb 
called no rebuttal witnesses for the government 
there was nothing to rebut said webb 
north whose 3 days of testimony was the centerpiece of the 
case against poindexter was right in the middle of it said 
the prosecutor 
granted immunity from prosecution north had to go on the 
witness stand whether he wanted to or not said webb 
north testified reluctantly against the former national security 
adviser he said he watched his boss tear up the presidential 
document that ratified the hawks shipment to iran

the time is ripe for wouldbe mobsters 
to think about succeeding new englands reputed crime boss the 
jailed raymond j junior patriarca law enforcement officials 
say 
a humiliating roundup began monday with the arrests of patriarca 
and 14 other mob figures in rhode island connecticut and 
massachusetts by thursday 21 organized crime figures were in 
custody in connection with the case 
law enforcement officials sayd any and all organized crime is 
evil but most agree that mob activity in new england is pennyante 
compared to families elsewhere on the east coast 
at the risk of being labeled a new yorker new york is the 
center of the cosa nostra there are five families here said 
ron goldstock director of the new york state organized crime 
commission 
the boston family tends to be way behind the new york families 
as far as the size scope of criminal activities and 
sophistication he said 
my understanding is that its a much smaller scale operation 
but its still lucrative said michael davitt of the organized 
crime strike force assigned to the us attorneys office in 
providence 
fbi agents held the roundup with 113count indictments with 
charges that included murder racketeering kidnapping gambling 
drug trafficking obstruction of justice and witness intimidation 
if those convictions hold up they will have decimated the 
cosa nostra family in the new england area said goldstock who 
also teaches law at cornell law school 
the providencebased crime family used to wield power under 
raymond ls patriarca juniors father and that power diminished 
after the elder patriarcas death in 1984 authorities said 
i think ray senior acted as sort of a mob diplomat and 
resolved disputes in connecticut davitt said in doing so new 
england organized crime gained more of a national reputation 
even if someone from new york city moved in reputed gambino 
crime family boss john gotti has been mentioned gaining a 
foothold in new england still wouldnt carry the same weight as 
having a resident family goldstock said 
it will certainly reduce the capability of the family to 
inflict harm on society he said 
the contenders in patriarcas family include edward mulligan 
romano william billy blackjack delsanto and luigi baby 
shanks manocchio authorities said all have been with the family 
since the elder patriarcas regime 
manocchio whose 1968 murder convictions in the gangland 
slayings of rudolph marfeo and anthony melei were overturned by the 
state supreme court seems to be factored out because of his low 
profile authorities said 
delsanto a former providence city worker who was accused of 
accepting paychecks as a noshow worker the charges were dropped 
because the state took too long to bring him to trial 
romano reputedly the only capo or captain in the patriarca 
family to escape indictment 
theyre the overthehill gang said john partington 
providences public safety commissioner who helped set up the 
original federal witness protection program to assist mob 
investigations when he worked for the us marshals service in the 
mid1960s 
south kingstown police chief vincent vespia a principal mob 
investigator during 22 years in the state police said law 
enforcement officials will have to watch the streets to determine 
what is going on with the patriarca family 
traditionally when mob bosses went to jail they get 
pretty well reorganized you cant put a gag on them vespia 
said i question whether raymond with the embarrassment here 
can operate very strongly from prison 
partington said if the younger patriarcas legal problems 
persist bosses in new york would want to install their own man 
but nothing will happen immediately he said the new york crime 
families are tied closely to new england 
out of due respect for his father junior is going to stay 
until something happens in court he said im sure there are 
meetings in new york about whats going to happen in rhode island 
and new england

a judge has ordered reinstatement of a government 
whistleblower who was fired after he revealed unsafe practices at 
the armys rock island arsenal 
charles curt mcrae a pilot fired two years after he turned 
in his supervisors also will receive back pay under the order 
filed thursday by administrative law judge phillip n miller 
miller said mcraes appeal to the merit system protection board 
had supported his allegation that his firing was in reprisal for 
activity protected under a federal law that protects whistleblowers 
the decision by miller will become final on may 3 unless a party 
to the matter appeals to the merit board or the board decides to 
reopen the case 
i am very happy i mean very happy that the judge looked at 
all the facts and ruled in our favor mcrae said in a telephone 
interview friday from his home 
mcrae said he had at times doubted he would be vindicated in the 
battle with his superiors at the northern illinois base 
this will kind of reaffirm that if youre willing to wait and 
be persistent the system will work yes mcrae said 
mcrae who has been looking for other work said he wants to go 
back to his military job but would report violations again if he 
saw them 
al schwartz an army spokesman at the arsenal said there was no 
immediate decision on how the agency would proceed 
we have received judge millers decision and at this time we 
are reviewing it in detail once we have completed our review we 
will determine what our action will be schwartz said 
mcraes reinstatement is retroactive to nov 29 1989 the date 
he appealed his firing 
at hearings held two weeks ago in rock island mcrae said he 
complained and went over aviation chief neil pobanzs head after 
pobanz repeatedly ignored pilots complaints about poor aircraft 
maintenance and unsafe practices 
mcrae was hired as a pilot for the arsenal in 1982 he was fired 
nov 17 1989 more than two years after he reported mishandling of 
dangerous chemicals and explosives among other flightsafety 
violations 
a month after he made his complaints in september 1987 mcrae 
was grounded by pobanz 
acting on mcraes tip army investigators found assorted 
violations including failure to report aircraft mishaps 
transportation of unauthorized personnel failure to notify the 
airport of hazardous cargo and falsification of officials documents

a senate conservative on friday attacked as 
shoddy a report that hiring discrimination has become 
widespread as a result of a 4yearold immigration law while 
liberal lawmakers defended that assessment 
you can fancy dan this baby all over the place you can double 
speak like you did in your conclusions but you really cant get 
away with that sen alan simpson rwyo told officials of the 
general accounting office 
simpsons remark that the accounting office did a shoddy and 
confounding job of analysis here came at a senate judiciary 
committee hearing at which the accounting office officials reported 
on their finding of widespread hiring discrimination caused by the 
1986 immigration control and reform act 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said it appeared that the 
report was correct the gao report confirms exactly what many of 
us in congress feared when employer sanctions were enacted in 1986 
that sanctions would be discriminatory against hispanicamerican 
citizens asianamerican citizens and other ethnic minorities 
the gao report must be immediately addressed by congress 
sen paul simon dill told the committee this report 
documents some of the most serious levels of discrimination some 
of our worst fears have been realized 
both sides in the dispute said that any discrimination in hiring 
is wrong and added that changes are needed in the nations 
immigration laws although they were not in agreement on precisely 
what should be done 
perhaps 10 percent of 46 million employers projected 
statistically by the report are engaging in discrimination against 
foreign looking or foreign sounding job applicants 
according to the gao a congressional investigative arm 
the report said the bias is being practiced by employers who are 
confused about the law which provides for civil and criminal 
penalties for those who knowingly hire foreign workers who are in 
this country illegally 
the law was designed to curb the flow of illegal aliens over the 
southern border in search of american jobs at the time it was 
passed a number of lawmakers expressed fear that the employer 
penalties or sanctions would lead to discrimination against 
eligible workers 
critics inserted in the law a requirement calling on the gao to 
study that question and report back to congress the report was 
made public on thursday 
the 10 percent estimate was used in the report to justify the 
use of widespread to describe the amount of discrimination 
caused by the law that finding in turn could lead to repeal of the 
employer sanctions provision 
simpson and gao officials led by comptroller general charles 
bowsher became snarled in a battle of statistics with the senator 
saying the report itself showed only 66 percent of employers 
discriminating the gao said the correct number should be 10 
percent

secretary of state james baker iii addressing 
supporters of israel in congress said jews have the right to live 
both in east and west jerusalem 
writing to rep mel levine dcalif baker sought to lay to 
rest a flap prompted by president bushs comments earlier this 
month 
at a news conference in palm springs calif bush said the 
united states does not believe there should be new jewish 
settlements in the israelioccupied west bank or in east jerusalem 
the eastern section of the city was captured by israel from jordan 
in the 1967 mideast war and then annexed to the western part of the 
holy city 
the united states and most countries refuse to recognize the 
united city as the israeli capital saying jerusalem should remain 
undivided but the question of its sovereignty must be determined in 
arabisraeli negotiations 
in his letter parts of which were made available to the 
associated press baker said he was very aware of the great 
significance which jerusalem has for the jewish people as well as 
for people of all religions 
clearly jews and others can live where they want east or 
west and the city must remain undivided baker said 
israel supporters hailed his comments as heralding a softening 
of the us position on the touchy issue we are heartened by 
this important clarification said the world jewish congress 
state department officials said there was no change in the us 
position still previous statements the most recent one issued by 
the white house on march 9 have spoken about the right of jews to 
live in all parts of jerusalem in the context of a negotiated 
settlement 
bakers letter dropped that condition 
bushs unprecedented statement equating jewish settlement in 
the west bank with that in east jerusalem helped set off a 
political crisis in israel that led to the fall of the government 
of prime minister yitzhak shamir 
it also generated a host of letters to baker from members of 
congress including levine concerned that us support for israel 
might be eroding 
in more than two decades of us diplomacy jerusalem and the 
west bank have been approached as separate issues jerusalem is 
touchier and american presidents and secretaries of state have 
tried to keep their distance from the issue

canada were bilked in a pyramid scheme that offered to turn a 105 
investment into a 46700 profit the fbi said friday 
four people have been arrested on fraud and other charges lodged 
in a 13count indictment issued by a federal grand jury the 
indictment handed up march 21 was unsealed after all four were 
arrested 
the victims of the 3year scheme were just ordinary people 
said fbi agent ron halter 
the investment scheme run out of charlotte nc used the

mail fraud wire fraud interstate transportation of stolen 
property conspiracy and money laundering both nationally and 
internationally authorities said 
the proceeds of the alleged scheme totaling 14 million could 
be forfeited to the federal government if the four are convicted 
the indictment says 
the defendants are accused of operating a fraudulent scheme 
between october 1986 and march 21 mostly in the eastern united 
states requiring participants to pay 105 in hopes of making 
46720 each participant was required to recruit two others and 
the expanding base of investors was supposed to provide the payoff 
for people who joined earlier 
they are accused of laundering money through the first american 
bank in plymouth montserrat in the british west indies to the 
first community bank in columbus ohio and then to other banks in 
the country 
if convicted each of the four could receive sentences up to 105 
years in prison and fined 375 million

sued the circles of light church to stop the group from operating 
in pennsylvania the fbi and the us postal inspection service 
began an investigation which was later joined by britains new 
scotland yard

farmers say they intend to boost corn 
plantings to 748 million acres this spring up 4 percent from last 
year and the most since 1986 the agriculture department said 
friday 
soybean plantings are expected to drop 2 percent to 594 million 
acres the departments agricultural statistics board said except 
for last year 1990 soybean plantings still would be the largest 
since 1986 
total wheat plantings for the 1990 harvest including winter 
wheat planted last fall and springplanted varieties were forecast 
at about 776 million acres up 1 percent from last year 
according to usda records the allwheat acreage would be the 
largest since 792 million acres were planted for the 1989 harvest 
the 1990 winter wheat crop was reported planted on 572 million 
acres up 4 percent from a year ago but durum wheat planted this 
spring was indicated at 335 million acres down 12 percent other 
types of spring wheat were estimated at 17 million acres down 4 
percent from last year 
farmers have been encouraged by relatively strong corn and wheat 
prices as well as an easing of acreage requirements under federal 
commodity programs in the case of soybeans however record world 
oilseed production has reduced prices from last season 
the 1990 planting figures were based on an annual march survey 
of approximately 75000 farmers to help determine how much land may 
be used for crops this year 
no production estimates were provided in the report the 
departments first estimate of winter wheat production will be 
issued may 10 and the first allwheat figures july 12 the first 
corn and soybean production estimates will be released aug 9 
the acreage report also indicated that farmers will plant more 
cotton rice peanuts tobacco and dry edible beans declines were 
reported for sorghum barley oats and hay 
officials cautioned that the actual crop acreages planted by 
farmers this year may vary from intentions because of the effects 
of weather availability of production inputs changes in market 
conditions prior to planting and the impact of the report itself 
other crops included in the survey report were 
cotton plantings 124 million acres up 17 percent from 1989 
sorghum 115 million acres down 9 percent 
barley 889 million acres down 3 percent 
oats 11 million acres down 9 percent

the state department has urged chinese 
authorities not to export mediumrange missiles but a spokesman 
said friday he was unable to offer firm assurances that china has 
not engaged in such transactions 
deputy spokesman richard boucher refused to characterize the 
chinese position other than to note that china has pledged to 
pursue a prudent and responsible attitude 
you are all well aware of the importance we attach to stopping 
missile proliferation our dialogue with beijing on missile 
proliferation continues he said 
the new york times reported in fridays editions that under 
secretary of state reginald bartholomew was unable to elicit 
assurances from chinas ambassador during a meeting last month that 
the country will not sell mediumrange missiles to the middle east 
boucher said administration officials have placed particular 
emphasis on the risks involved in missile sales to the middle east 
and on missiles with a range of at least 300 kilometers and with a 
payload of at least 500 kilograms 
beijing has said that it will follow a prudent and responsible 
attitude and we will look for actions consistent with that 
statement boucher said 
he said the administration had been unable to confirm media 
reports suggesting that china has resumed missile sales to the 
middle east 
the most recent reports said western diplomats believe china is 
selling missiles to a middle east country but that those missiles 
have a shorter range than those about which the administration has 
expressed concern 
china has dismissed the report as a rumor

lithuanias chief prosecutor sat in the 
conference hall his cheeks flush with anger as the soviet unions 
deputy prosecutor informed the staff that from now on moscows man 
was their boss 
sandyhaired arturis paulauskas 37 appointed a week earlier by 
the lithuanian government listened silently to fridays statement 
by soviet deputy prosecutor alexei vasiliev 
the incident was the first attempt by soviet officials to take 
direct control of a lithuanian government agency since the baltic 
republics parliament declared independence on march 11 
after vasiliev read his statement the employees began shouting 
and arguing with him 
one employee stood up and declared that the soviet constitution 
says every republic has the right to sovereignty 
the rest of the staff broke into loud applause 
questions of that kind must be solved in a constitutional 
way vasiliev countered 
but another lithuanian employee took the argument one step 
further with a reference to the soviet annexation of lithuania in 
1940 do you think 1940 was solved in a constitutional way he 
shouted 
vasiliev maintained that the general prosecutor of the 
ussr has the right to name any prosecutor he wants 
vasiliev named antanas petrauskas an ethnic lithuanian to 
replace paulauskas he also ordered the legal staff of almost 100 
to carry out soviet law 
staff members reacted to the replacement with angry questions 
do you know our government was elected legally one told 
vasiliev 
another staffer stood up and asked what will the prosecutor 
of the ussr do if 90 percent of the prosecutorial staff leaves 
their jobs 
i would not like to guess vasiliev said 
lithuanian legislator egidius bickauskas coldly told vasiliev he 
should remember he was currently on the sovereign territory of 
lithuania and not in the ussr 
you can occupy this building with the help of paratroopers 
but that occupation will be different from the occupation of party 
buildings he said referring to the occupation by soviet 
paratroopers of at least five communist party buildings this week 
i cant ask him vasiliev to leave this room bickauskas 
went on addressing the workers but i hope you will consider 
your place is in your offices under the leadership of mr 
paulauskas 
at that almost everyone in the room applauded got up and left 
you must obey the orders of the general prosecutor of the 
ussr vasiliev said in a raised voice as people left 
vasiliev told several reporters afterward that his 11member 
team from moscow is not an instrument of force he said his 
next step in the dispute would be a legal one but he would not 
elaborate 
paulauskas back in his office said i am the prosecutor of 
lithuania and i will stay here until force is used against me 
he said he had looked up the relevant soviet law and figured his 
defiance to moscow could only be punished by a maximum of three 
years in prison 
he said he considered it likely he would be barred from the 
building on monday and implied he might move the offices 
operations to a different site 
when the prosecutors secretary henrika pocei was asked who 
she worked she paused and said i think i have to go home 
but she added itll be really interesting on monday

control of the army and police but stressed that demobilization of

the choice is simple you can go see my left 
foot or you can watch a quartet of mansize gogglewearing 
turtles eat pizza 
like it or not the teenage mutant ninja turtles are now at 
a theater near you and this weekends opening will test the 
unproven theory that a hit toy can forge a profitable trail for a 
blockbuster movie 
the turtles were born six years ago in a 1200 comic book 
partially funded by a tax refund the turtles now star in a smash 
animated television series and have become one of the hottest 
childrens products since cabbage patch kids 
playmates toys inc sold 115 million in turtlerelated 
merchandise last year some 175 manufacturers are pushing about 600 
turtle items including turtle pizzas a musical talking turtle 
toothbrush turtle underwear cereal pork rinds yogurt cookies 
and sleepwear 
its definitely our most popular line said richard sallis 
playmates senior vice president for marketing ive never seen 
anything like this before the turtles are the nations third 
bestselling toy behind nintendo and barbie 
the question though is whether bed sheets can translate to 
boxoffice like never before hollywood has become obsessed in 
adapting trends for the screen the lambada prompted two movies 
and beach volleyball is the focus of the new film side out 
the makers of teenage mutant ninja turtles are betting that 
the liveaction 15 million film will be as strong in theaters as 
the turtles are in toy stores the movie is playing in 1900 movie 
houses a spectacularly wide release 
this movie had an extraordinary awareness level before we did 
anything said sondra ruch marketing president for the movies 
distributor new line cinema kids find these turtles 
irresistible 
alex lee 5 is one such fan i like them because they are so 
cool basically they wear masks all the time and you know they do 
cool stuff lee said they have japanese weapons they are 
ninjas they dont wear too much clothes and they eat pizza 
the challenge for new line is to distinguish the movie from the 
animated series and thus create a broader audience sneak previews 
on college campuses played to packed houses new line reports and 
the film fared well late thursday night to mostly adult viewers 
we had to differentiate between the cartoon and the movie 
ruch said and the line weve been using in our campaign is hey 
dude this is no cartoon 
it may not be a cartoon but the pgrated movie is filled with 
comicbookstyle violence its violence while not graphic is 
much more abundant than the rating might lead parents to believe 
a review in the new york times said 
the movie developed before the toys became so coveted focuses 
on the adventures of the four turtles leonardo michaelangelo 
raphael and donatello who try to foil teenage hoods on the loose 
in new york city it is directed by steve barron and written by 
bobby herbeck muppet creator jim henson designed the turtle 
outfits for the film 
other filmmakers have attempted to capitalize on wellliked toys 
with mixed results 
in 1987 cannon released masters of the universe a 
liveaction film based on a thenpopular toy and animated 
television series starring dolph lundgren the movie was a 
critical and commercial flop 
reviews of the turtle movie have been mixed but this might be a 
reviewproof film 
usa today gave it three stars out of a possible four saying 
if you think the teenage mutant ninja turtles are awesome in 
cartoon and toy form wait till you see them in live action 
the new york times review called the film a mutant of sorts a 
contentious unsightly hybrid of martialarts exploitation film and 
liveaction cartoon 
mark freedman who supervises licensing and entertainment 
marketing for the turtles says the characters do not exploit 
audiences the way other animated figures have in the past 
the hook he said is not clever merchandising but 
threedimensional characters and a creative plot you cant fool 
kids they wouldnt want to go see the movie if it was just a long 
cartoon 
he said the turtles are popular because they reject most of the 
conventions of animated programming 
all the traditional super heroes are either the mightiest or 
the fastest he said the turtles are neither theyre funny

relatives of activists killed by the 
government demonstrated outside the presidential palace friday 
demanding the prosecution of military officers responsible for the 
slayings 
hundreds of people held up a huge red and white banner reading 
truth and justice in chile no to impunity mimes dressed as 
ghosts moved through a mock cemetery 
the demonstration was the first of its kind since the military 
gave way to an elected civilian leadership march 11 
organizers vowed to hold similar protests outside the 
presidential palace on the last friday of each month 
most of the demonstrators were women who planted posters of 
dead or missing husbands sons or other relatives in an empty 
garden patch outside the palace 
they placed red carnations around the posters while mimes in 
black writhed between the posters imitating ghosts 
a squad of national police stood nearby with a teargas truck 
and a water cannon at one point they tried to push the 
demonstrators away but later they backed off and waited for the 
protest to break up on its own 
the government of former military ruler augusto pinochet who 
has retained command of the 60000man army was repeatedly accused 
of systematic abuses by international human rights organizations 
after seizing power in 1973 pinochet launched a massive 
crackdown on leftists in which hundreds were killed and thousands 
jailed tortured or deported 
president patricio aylwin has said he will let the courts act 
independently in cases of abuses but he has also said that to 
achieve national reconciliation the country must be prepared to 
forgive past offenses

east german leaders tried to defuse a 
political crisis friday by inspecting dossiers the secret police 
kept on them and the official news service adn said they were 
cleared of links to the notorious stasi 
on thursday nationwide demonstrations were held demanding an 
investigation of allegations that some victors in east germanys 
first free elections were informants for the despised security 
apparatus of the former stalinist regime 
adn said officals overseeing the disbanding of the secret police 
let the nations most influential politicians or their 
representatives study the confidential files on friday it said 
the leaders of the three major political factions were given access 
to the files 
the politicians were accompanied by citzens representatives and 
officials overseeing dismantling of the secret police the agency 
reported 
it said manfred stolpe senior administrator of east berlins 
lutheran church looked at the files of christian democratic leader 
lothar de maiziere and found no evidence connecting him with the 
secret police 
adn said de maiziere asked stolpe and communist party chief 
gregor gysi to look at the files for him 
the agency said stolpe also found no evidence that gysi head of 
the new reformoriented communist party had secret police ties 
adn said gysi looked at his files with stolpe 
social democratic chairman ibrahim boehme looked at his records 
himself and told reporters he also was cleared 
de maizieres conservative political alliance finished with the 
most votes in march 18 elections the social democrats finished a 
distant second and the communists third 
boehme said last week he was temporarily stepping down as party 
chairman amid allegations he was a secret police informant on 
friday he said he was resuming his duties because inspection of 
the files proved his innocence 
the allegations of secret police involvement have clouded talks 
on forming east germanys freely elected government 
de maziere has been trying to forge a coalition with the 
leftleaning social democrats to ensure a majority in the new 
parliament so it will adopt a plan for swift unification with west 
germany 
after more than five hours of checking between 200 and 300 
pages of records kept at the now disbanded stasi headquarters in 
east berlin a smiling boehme told reporters waiting outside the 
building everything is fine 
two lawyers went with him to the headquarters 
the social democrats have expressed concern about working with 
the ultraconservative element of de maizieres alliance the german 
social union 
but the social democrats and christian democrats said on 
thursday that they had agreed on basic points of forming a majority 
coalition 
the office of the interim east german president manfred 
gerlach meanwhile announced friday that the new 400member 
parliament will convene on april 5 adn said 
since hardline communist erich honecker was toppled on oct 18 
a proreform interim government dominated by the communists has run 
the country 
east germany essentially leaderless since the revolt has been 
beset by mass emigration and economic problems as it awaits 
eventual reunification with wealthy west germany

contempt of court charges were filed friday 
against the us department of energy and the operator of the 
fernald uranium processing plant for allegedly violating a cleanup 
agreement 
state attorney general anthony j celebrezze jr accused the 
federal government and westinghouse materials co of ohio inc of 
mishandling hazardous waste containers failing to properly analyze 
some 40000 drums of radioactive material and failing to develop a 
written inspection schedule westinghouse operates the fernald 
plant 
the performance since 1988 has not been all bad but its 
my experience that only after we hit them with a club that they 
start compliance celebrezze said 
under a december 1988 consent decree the plant must comply with 
state and federal hazardous waste laws and pollution standards 
celebrezze said the consent decree gave the state clear authority 
to regulate disposal and treatment of hazardous waste 
the decree did not cover radioactive waste he said 
celebrezze asked us district judge s arthur spiegel to force 
the government to make proper environmental reports use safe 
containers for hazardous waste and guarantee that waste water does 
not spill on the ground 
celebrezze also is seeking proper sampling of the hazardous 
waste 
the attorney general said the state would leave the amount of 
any possible fine up to spiegel 
celebrezze said westinghouse did not sign the consent decree but 
is subject to its terms because the energy department signed on 
behalf of all contractors including westinghouse 
there was no immediate response from the energy department or 
westinghouse 
the fernald plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati began 
processing uranium in 1951 for use in nuclear reactors and weapons 
the contractor operating the 1050acre plant westinghouse 
materials corp of ohio suspended production last year to 
concentrate on cleanup efforts 
a lawsuit on behalf of 14000 people living or working within 
five miles of the plant led to an unprecedented 78 million 
settlement last summer by the doe the government made its first 
16 million payment on the settlement last month 
the reagan administration called for closing the plant by the 
mid1990s but the current administration hasnt endorsed the plan 
the cleanup cost has been estimated at 1 billion to 5 billion 
the federal government entered into an agreement with ohio that 
gives the state courtenforceable regulatory authority over the 
cleanup of hazardous wastes not including nuclear waste 
stored at the plant in waste pits two concrete silos and 
thousands of 55gallon drums are more than 500000 metric tons of 
radioactive wastes dating from current plant operations to the 
world war iiera manhattan project to develop the atomic bomb 
the energy department in 1985 admitted that the plant had 
released about 300000 pounds of uranium oxide dust into the 
atmosphere over the years through faulty exhaustfilter systems

two dozen islanders accused of 
torturing to death six people have told a court they were possessed 
by the devil or seized by religious fervor during a hunt for evil 
spirits in 1987 
all week the jury has been considering the case which focuses 
on two days of terror on the remote atoll of faaite after a visit 
by three women who claimed to represent a charismatic movement 
founded in the united states 
psychiatric experts testified that the charismatic movement 
mixed with ancient polynesian beliefs in the supernatural produced 
a dangerous mix on an isolated island lacking institutional 
authority 
the three women whom investigators ruled never ordered the 
killings are not on trial 
but witnesses say the violence had its roots in a visit that 
august by the three women from tahiti about 310 miles west 
i had a spirit under the spell of the devil one of the 
islanders from faaite told judge marcel bihl of the papeete 
tribunal on thursday i lost my head but i believed i was on the 
holy path shunning the evil fighting within me 
other defendants clad in bright tropical shirts and white 
trousers said they lost selfcontrol during the search for demons 
and sorcerers 
the 24 defendants are charged with murder inciting violence and 
other offenses 
the women claimed to represent the charismatic renewal a 
movement founded in 1967 and affiliated with the roman catholic 
church however church authorities said they had no connection 
with the women 
at the time the movement already had a strong following on 
faaite an atoll studded with white sand beaches and about 180 
residents 
the women regarded as priestesses by the islanders took over 
the tiny whitewashed church and by force of personality replaced 
the lay preacher as the religious authority on the atoll witnesses 
said 
the trios leader alexandra silvia conducted services in a 
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that god would 
abandon faaite the defendants said 
she suggested demons were in their midst and the population 
began viewing with suspicion fellow islanders who failed to attend 
her daily services 
in late august that year the trio left faaite and gave roses to 
seven islanders designating them as disciples to continue their 
work 
on sept 2 ioane harris the assistant mayor publicly 
denounced what was happening 
one defendant told the court he looked into harris eyes and 
believed him possessed maddened villagers tightened a cord around 
harris neck held a crucifix before his face and beat him 
senseless 
they then drowned harris during a ritual in the lagoon and threw 
his body on a bonfire built under palm trees in front of the church 
it was necessary to purify him one of the defendants calmly 
told the court it was necessary to purify the village 
five more people were killed over the next two days one a 
mentally handicapped young man who claimed to be jesus christ was 
burned alive 
informed of the killings the mayor arrived on sept 4 with a 
catholic priest and a squadron of police in time to stop further 
violence 
the jury was expected reach a verdict after two weeks testimony

the hungarian democratic forum 
strongest party in last sundays free elections agreed on friday 
to form an alliance with two smaller conservative parties in the 
runoff elections april 8 
the state news agency mti said the forum agreed with the 
independent smallholders party and the christian democrats to have 
voters cast ballots for whichever candidate of the three parties is 
strongest in their districts 
it could be a preliminary step to forming a conservative 
coalition to head hungarys first democratic government in more 
than 40 years 
a split vote and complex electoral system meant that only five 
of the 386 contested parliamentary seats were decided in last 
sundays first round of elections eight additional seats will be 
distributed to ethnic minorities for a total of 394 seats in 
parliament 
the democratic forum won 2471 percent of the vote sunday and 
its chief rival the liberal league of free democrats won 2138 
percent 
the independent smallholders were third with 1176 percent and 
the christian democrats sixth with 646 percent 
in the runoff the league of free democrats is likely to team up 
with the leftist young democrats who took 894 percent of the 
votes sunday 
the governing socialists formed from the communist reformers 
who led hungary peacefully toward democracy came fourth with 1089 
percent 
the socialists are still associated in voters minds with the 
excesses of stalinism however and both the forum and free 
democrats reject any coalition which includes them 
both the democratic forum and free democrats agree on one issue 
the need for a market economy

secretary of state james a baker iii urged 
americans on friday to support a us foreign policy based on 
idealism plus realism and not to withdraw from the foreign 
field now that communism is in retreat 
the time of sweeping away the old dictators is passing fast 
baker said the time of building up the new democracies has 
arrived 
baker spoke to the world affairs council in dallas texts were 
distributed at the state department where us officials said one 
of bakers aims was to combat neoisolationism in america 
now that the adversaries of democracy are weaker some say we 
should retire mission accomplished to tend our problems at 
home baker said in his prepared remarks i am not among them 
in the new world struggling to be born like the old world now 
rapidly passing away there is no substitute for american 
leadership 
the speech was largely philosophical there was no mention in it 
of lithuania where secessionists are seeking stronger support from 
the bush administration 
afterward baker said the united states was continuing to call 
for a resolution of the dispute through dialogue and independence 
weve never recognized the incorporation of lithuania into the 
soviet union in 1940 baker said 
we support lithuanians in their desire to achieve 
selfdetermination the real issue is how do we best get there 
baker also praised the soviet leadership for a commitment to 
reform that he said has brought about remarkable changes in 
eastern europe and other areas of the world 
the us officials who briefed reporters under condition of 
anonymity said baker preferred focusing on broader foreign policy 
issues 
one of his central themes was the surprisingly rapid trend 
toward democracy around the world 
when president bush took office in january 1989 there was a 
new breeze blowing for freedom baker said now 14 months later 
he said that breeze has become a galeforce wind 
baker cited nicaragua and developments in central and eastern 
europe 
but he stressed as we enter a new era of democracy the old 
arguments of idealism versus realism must be replaced by idealism 
plus realism 
on the one hand he said americans will not support a us 
foreign policy that lacks support for humane values 
and yet baker said i am equally convinced that americans 
will reject a policy based primarily on moral exhortation which 
ignores our power to act

zulu fighters supporting rival 
black factions clashed with guns and knives friday in natal 
province and the african national congress persuaded nelson 
mandela to cancel a peace rally in the region 
the sudden cancellation angered the leader of inkatha whose 
followers are pitted in the battles against supporters of the 
ancsupported united democratic front 
the fighting this week has left at least 37 dead sent thousands 
fleeing their villages and prompted the whiteminority government 
to threaten a crackdown 
it also has kept mandela from forging black unity before 
preliminary talks with the government on dismantling apartheid 
those talks are scheduled april 11 
mandela had planned to join inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi 
in a rally monday in the wartorn edendale valley of natal 
inkatha favors a zulubased state in natal while the united 
democratic front favors a united south africa under democratic 
majority rule both groups have been fighting for control of black 
townships since 1983 
the atmosphere is not yet ideal for a joint rally in natal 
the ancs cancellation announcement said it did not elaborate 
the statement said however that mandela will go to natal on 
monday and tuesday to visit the affected areas and that 
arrangements were being made for a private meeting with buthelezi 
it was issued after a fivehour meeting of mandela and anc 
officials at mandelas soweto home mandela and other anc leaders 
were unavailable for comment later 
buthelezi said mandela told him in a telephone conversation that 
anc and united democratic front leaders thought the situation in 
natal was too tense for the rally 
but buthelezi said people are going to die while they delay 
it was his initiative his suggestion and he saw it as a matter of 
urgency that we address a joint peace meeting either on monday or 
tuesday 
some anc and udf leaders in natal opposed a mandelabuthelezi 
meeting on grounds it might give positive publicity to buthelezi 
mandela appeared to put aside such considerations thursday 
night when he said of the planned rally this is not time for 
people with political differences to stand on ceremony we must 
unite now in our commitment to end the violence in natal and work 
out a strategy we are all united behind 
a joint rally by the two was seen as an important step in 
efforts to stop the revenge slaughter that has escalated beyond the 
original political differences it has now been complicated by 
criminal gangs and personal disputes 
police said at least 37 people had been killed since tuesday in 
clashes between zulu bands in the rugged hill country near edendale 
its impossible to say how many people have been hurt its in 
the hundreds police maj piet kitching said 
rival war bands were battling friday in rural areas but the 
situation was quieter police said 
its very tense it could erupt again at any time its a 
terrible situation kitching said 
nearly 4000 have died in the past four years in the feuding 
president fw de klerk said friday the unrest was becoming a 
threat to stability and the government would use force to restore 
order 
demonstrators openly espousing violence or preaching class and 
racial hatred are playing with fire fanning these flames may 
easily lead to a catastrophic intergroup conflagration he told 
the cape town press club 
de klerk gave no details but said he would make a statement to 
parliament on monday on measures to stop the violence it is the 
worst to sweep the country since the national state of emergency 
was declared june 12 1986 
also friday the government freed seven more black nationalists 
from prison including the nephew of african national congress 
leader walter sisulu the anc the leading black antiapartheid 
group has demanded the release of all political prisoners as a 
condition for talking with the government 
the government lifted bans on mandelas autobiography the 
struggle is my life and the antiapartheid movie a dry white 
season

a mental patient who walked away from a 
state hospital and randomly stabbed a 9yearold girl to death at a 
street fair was found innocent by reason of insanity friday 
david r peterson 38 lacked the capacity to conform his 
conduct to the requirements of the law a threejudge superior 
court panel unanimously concluded in acquitting him of murder and 
escape charges 
however dr donald r grayson a statecommissioned 
psychiatrist who examined peterson said it would be a dreadful 
mistake in judgment ever to release him from a highsecurity 
psychiatric facility 
at petersons arraignment last summer an angry crowd yelled 
kill him kill him when he was brought to court but there 
were no such demonstrations friday 
the girls parents catherine and robert short and a handful of 
their closest friends were present for the brief reading of the 
verdict they showed no emotion as the decision was announced and 
declined to comment when they left the courthouse 
the shorts are planning to sue the state 
peterson walked off the grounds of connecticut valley hospital 
last july 28 he took a bus three miles downtown bought a hunting 
knife at a main street sporting goods shop and walked only about 
100 yards before pouncing on 9yearold jessica short 
he picked his victim at random from a crowd of hundreds 
attending a sidewalk sale and fair he stabbed her 34 times before 
stunned and horrified bystanders and police could pull him away 
judges james higgins barry schaller and salvatore arena who 
began deliberations wednesday afternoon ordered peterson committed 
to the custody of the state mental health commissioner for 
evaluation 
he will be held at the whiting forensic institute the states 
only maximumsecurity institution at least until another court 
hearing to determine whether he should be confined or released 
his attorney public defender christopher james said peterson 
is happy to be at whiting because he feels safer there 
psychiatrists hired by both the prosecution and the defense 
testified during the trial that peterson represents a chronic 
danger to society and is as dangerous as a mentally ill person can 
be to others 
peterson a chronic paranoid schizophrenic with a history of 
mental illness and violence has spent 15 of his past 20 years in 
mental institutions in 1971 and again in 1988 he was found 
innocent by reason of insanity in stabbing attacks and ordered 
committed to state hospitals 
in 1988 he was moved from whiting to connecticut valley 
hospital after doctors at both places said they believed he could 
be adequately supervised in a minimumsecurity setting said the 
state psychiatric security review board 
petersons attorney said the case shows that the board which by 
law has the primary duty of protecting society should seek the 
recommendations of outside experts rather than relying solely on 
information coming from the hospitals 
about two hours before he killed the girl peterson had been 
screaming about pain in his legs and arms that he blamed on the 
medication he was taking the psychiatrist hired by the defense 
said the patient should have been confined to his ward after the 
outburst because he had a history of psychotic delusions being 
accompanied by violence 
instead peterson was allowed to follow his normal routine and 
go out onto the hospital grounds without supervison according to 
court testimony 
peterson told police he killed miss short to take revenge on his 
doctors because they wouldnt change his medication 
he told psychiatrists he went downtown to take revenge on his 
enemies whites of european descent and had pictured himself 
as a soldier marching into battle

the government friday removed 
the ban on nelson mandelas autobiography saying it is now part 
of the accepted political rhetoric in south africa 
the government censorship board also lifted the ban on a dry 
white season an antiapartheid movie starring donald sutherland 
and marlon brando made in the united states and based on a novel 
by south african andre brink 
the publication appeals board banned mandelas autobiography 
the struggle is my life three years ago 
mandela was released feb 11 after 27 years in prison for his 
role in launching the bombing and sabotage campaign of the african 
national congress he continues to support the ancs armed 
struggle although it has been largely dormant the past year 
as far as the principle of armed violence is concerned 
mandelas standpoint is so well known that it is unlikely it will 
change the outlook of the reader toward political violence the 
appeals board said in its judgment 
other books about mandela and the anc have been available in 
south africa for several years 
speaking about a dry white season the panel said in a 
statement the board believes this film is a serious one which 
addresses the sensitive relations between white and black in south 
africa 
in the boards opinion it attempts to improve these 
relations sadly it often loses its effect by falling into 
propaganda 
the film was screened at a south african film festival last year 
but was banned from general circulation 
it concerns a series of injustices suffered by a black family at 
the hands of white authorities a white teacher played by 
sutherland becomes involved and unsuccessfully seeks redress 
through the courts 
another antiapartheid film cry freedom is scheduled to 
reopen in south africa on april 27 
the board approved the film in july 1988 but police used their 
powers under the national state of emergency to confiscate it from 
theaters the day it opened saying it posed a threat to public 
safety 
the distributors said police returned the copies of the film 
recently 
cry freedom is about black activist steve biko who died in 
police custody in 1977 and donald woods a white newspaper editor 
who had befriended him

after weeks of sporadic clashes a 
ceasefire between rival christian forces collapsed friday in 
thunderous battles that killed at least 38 people and left beirut 
and the surrounding hills in flames 
the fighting began at daybreak and continued without letup past 
midnight 
residents of the metn region overlooking beirut reported heavy 
shelling the residents reached by telephone from cyprus said 
they had been in bomb shelters since dawn 
its allout war again said a police spokesman who cannot 
be named under standing regulations 
a ceasefire had been in effect since march 3 between gen 
michel aouns troops and the rival lebanese forces militia it had 
been violated repeatedly raising fears of renewed warfare but 
none of the previous fighting was as serious as that friday 
the christian forces have been battling since jan 30 for 
control of the christian enclave aoun began the warfare in january 
by moving to crush samir geageas militia the main challenger to 
aouns authority in the christian region 
police said at least 38 people were killed and 65 wounded in 
savage combat friday in the central sector of christian east beirut 
and in the mountains of kesrouan province 20 miles northeast of 
the capital 
since jan 30 at least 814 people have died in the battles 
most have been civilians 
thunderous blasts reverberated across beirut 
schools churches apartments and shops were set ablaze in the 
city and across kesrouan and flames lit the night sky over beirut 
police said scores of houses collapsed on their tenants 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir spiritual head of the maronite 
catholic community of which aoun and geagea are members threatened 
both men with excommunication if fighting did not stop 
this horrific destructive shelling which the army and the 
lebanese forces blame on each other has forced people to flee 
their homes and take shelter in forests sfeir said 
how dare they claim they are defending christian land while 
they are turning it into scorched earth he said the statement 
was broadcast on beirut radio stations 
sfeir also issued an excommunication threat march 2 a day 
before the ceasefire 
geagea responded to sfeirs latest appeal by saying he would 
stop shooting if aoun reciprocated there was no immediate response 
from aoun 
aouns force of 19000 army troops and geageas 6000man 
militia accused each other of destroying the truce 
aouns command said geagea forces tried to attack army positions 
at badaro next to the geagea stronghold of ashrafieh in east 
beirut 
the attackers suffered heavy losses in lives and equipment 
a communique said 
the lebanese forces issued their own communique it said aouns 
troops attacked the mountain village of kleiat in an attempt to 
clear a path way for aouns troops to capture kesrouan province 
the lebanese forces prevented aouns units from accomplishing 
their objectives and succeeded in pushing them aouns units 
almost completely out of kleiat in a counterattack the lebanese 
forces chief spokesman george abdulmassih told the associated 
press 
before the new outbreak of fighting aouns army held a quarter 
of kleiat the rest was under lebanese forces control 
on thursday maronite leaders met in bkirki seat of the 
maronite patriarchate and empowered a mediation committee to 
reopen talks with geagea and aoun for a political solution 
aoun boycotted the meeting geagea attended and said he will 
press for a resolution urging aoun and himself to discuss with 
president elias hrawi an overall settlement of the lebanese crisis 
aoun geagea and hrawi are all maronites the 900000strong 
catholic sect that has dominated government since lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 
the syrianbacked hrawi was elected president by parliament in 
november and given the task of implementing political reforms 
designed to end 15 years of sectarian civil war 
the reforms and election were part of an arab leaguebrokered 
peace treaty endorsed the previous month 
aoun rejects that accord because it does not guarantee the 
withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops deployed in lebanon since 1976 
to quell civil war fighting 
he refuses to recognize hrawi who dismissed aoun as army 
commander and interim prime minister in november the general has 
refused to step down 
geagea recognizes the presidency he has not declared his 
support for the accord which would give the moslems more of a say 
in governing lebanon

buffalos subway and bus system hurtled 
toward a shutdown as a lastminute rescue plan announced friday by 
mayor james d griffin ran into opposition 
erie county officials who earlier rejected a utility tax to 
fund mass transit criticized griffins new proposal to use county 
sales taxes and an advance on county operating subsidies to keep 
the system afloat 
county leaders said they saw no way to avoid a saturday night 
shutdown of the bus and subway system which carries 120000 riders 
a day in new yorks secondlargest city 
if the niagara frontier transportation authoritys buses and 
subways stop running 9700 students who normally take public buses 
to school will be on their own buffalo school officials said 
hospital administrators said they would handle the shutdown as 
if it were a blizzard encouraging workers to stagger their hours 
and form car pools and would look into renting private buses if 
necessary griffin said the city might relax parking restrictions 
riders lamented the political logjam 
its terrible said pat gustine of suburban williamsville 
im in favor of them upping the fare or doing whatever they have 
to do 
in another development the transit agencys executive director 
alfred h savage accepted a 149500ayear post as head of the 
chicago transit authority savage resigned from the transportation 
authority thursday saying he was fed up with the countys 
unwillingness to support public transit 
the system has been squeezed between rising costs and declining 
federal subsidies since 1985 when it opened its subway line 
the bus and subway system cost 52 million to operate in the 
year ending march 31 and ran a deficit of 195 million farebox 
revenues pay about 40 percent of the operating cost most of the 
rest comes from shrinking federal state and county grants 
the crisis point was reached wednesday when the county 
legislature rejected a proposed tax on public utilities that would 
have raised 9 million for transit a day later transportation 
authority commissioners voted 81 to suspend operations saying the 
legislatures action showed community leaders dont want a transit 
system 
transportation authority comptroller michael j neumeister said 
the agency will have just 89000 in the bank saturday night and 
will have to borrow from its profitable greater buffalo 
international airport operation to meet the shutdown expense of 
13 million expenses include final payroll and unemployment 
insurance payments 
the plan announced by the mayor on friday would take 9 million 
from an expected increase in local sales tax collections he said 
the city which faces a 30 million deficit cant afford to give 
up its share of that money but cant afford to give up the transit 
system either 
shutting down affects those people who dont appear to have 
any voice griffin said if we close down this system shame on 
all of us 
but such a change would need the approval of the county 
legislature the elected county executive and the mayors of two 
other erie county cities and officials said friday that approval 
was unlikely to be granted 
county executive dennis gorski said he opposes the sales tax 
transfer and the mayors proposal that the county advance the 
system 21 million in subsidies that would normally be paid in 
august 
he leaves out the part where property and school taxes across 
erie county will have to be raised to make up the difference 
gorski said on thursday gorski said he would refuse an advance 
unless his own proposal for sweeping service cuts and 
reorganization of the transportation authority is adopted 
leonard r lenihan the county legislatures majority leader 
said he didnt think the sales tax proposal would win much support 
in that body

dozens of screens offering crystal clear 
largerthanlife images of rock concerts boxing matches and 
surreal animation greeted broadcasters as the industrys annual 
convention began friday one term was on nearly everyones lips 
hdtv 
high definition television commanded center stage at the 
advanced technology exhibit which launched the national 
association of broadcasters fiveday convention 
dozens of hdtv screens offering sharp images flashed beside 
displays of high definition lenses fiberoptic cameras and special 
effects gizmos aimed at changing the way tv is made and watched 
hdtv would give viewers a picture far sharper than current 
broadcast standards by more than doubling the number of lines that 
make up a tv image 
a major issue overhanging the exhibits is how the disparate 
technology can be standardized and sold in a way that wont make 
obsolete the millions of television sets now in use 
convention organizers say hdtv probably wont be available to 
us homes until at least the middle of this decade 
the issues are not so much what is technically possible 
said michael c rau the associations senior vice president for 
science and technology rather the issues are what kind of hdtv 
actually can be achieved what technologies and standards can be 
agreed upon what technologies have consensus 
displays at the convention suggest that technologically 
speaking a great deal is possible 
for example the towering pioneer cube system that greeted 
visitors friday with an ultrasharp broadcast of a rock concert 
made it clear that tv can look a lot better than what most people 
see in their homes 
cube used a bank of 12 40inch hdtv screens each one showing a 
part of the larger picture and together presenting an image that 
was remarkably clear for a largescreen display 
drawing a small crowd nearby was an exhibit by the broadcasting 
technology association of tokyo of ghost reducer equipment 
designed to eliminate the multiple images that have bothered 
viewers since televisions infancy 
the problem occurs when television signals are reflected off 
mountains tall buildings or other structures officials said the 
new technology eliminates the problem by adding an extra signal at 
the transmitter which is picked up by a device on the tv set and 
used to filter out the distorted signal 
the system was standardized in japan in 1989 and is used by more 
than 100 tv stations there 
several us companies are working on similar technology but 
reducers are not expected to be available here for several years 
its not yet a consumer product because the demand will not 
justify the investment or the cost said amihai miron video 
department head for philips laboratories in briarcliff manor ny 
one of the us companies that have developed ghost reducer 
prototypes 
miron said it would cost up to 1200 under current conditions 
to equip a television set to use the system 
hundreds of additional exhibitors and dozens of panels and 
workshops are scheduled when the general sessions of the 
convention expected to draw more than 50000 people begin 
saturday 
president bush is scheduled to address the gathering monday

a holiday honoring martin luther king jr 
won final approval in the legislature on friday making idaho the 
47th state agreeing to adopt the federal holiday 
senate passage of the measure on a 2811 vote assured it of 
becoming law with gov cecil andrus promised approval 
the vote was one of the legislatures last acts before 
adjourning for the year and came four years after the state 
designated the third monday in january as a commemorative day but 
not an official holiday for king 
arizona new hampshire and montana also have refused to 
designate a holiday 
weve come a long way down the road sen mary lou reed 
said we have the finest package of human rights legislation in 
the nation 
the legislature has passed some of the toughest laws in the 
nation against racial harassment and discrimination but the king 
holiday after winning initial senate passage was sidetracked in 
the house 
final passage came when the senate agreed to a house amendment 
to call the holiday martin luther king jridaho human rights day 
a black community leader the rev ellis robinson of st paul 
baptist church in boise said the action extended the holiday 
beyond king to anyone whos ever struggled and worked for the 
rights of others 
were not looking at this as a victory for black people 
robinson said were looking at it as a victory for all people 
the king holiday was pushed by lawmakers and the governor in 
part to offset the negative image the state has developed because 
of the presence of white supremacists at the aryan nations compound 
of richard butler in the states panhandle 
the major opposition focused on the potential cost of another 
day off for government workers estimated anywhere between 100000 
and 2 million depending on whether payroll is considered

a management company denied on friday two days 
after a search by customs officers that the company had supplied 
sensitive equipment to iraq without notifying with the government 
officers investigating an alleged iraqi smuggling operation 
seized documents in the raid wednesday at global technical and 
management services international based in deeside wales an 
unidentified company in edinburgh scotland also was raided 
the british news agency press association said officials were 
looking for information on alleged smuggling to iraq of acoustic 
detonators for sea mines that can distinguish between friendly and 
enemy ships 
documents seized wednesday reportedly contained proof that at 
least one acoustic detonator already had been smuggled to iraq 
global issued a statement friday saying it recently completed a 
contract with iraq to clear offshore waterways of mines and debris 
to make shipping lanes safe 
the project involved the supply to iraq of equipment and 
personnel to carry out the work and also to train iraqi navy 
personnel it said 
but the company said it would not provide any service to iraq 
or any other foreign country that was not accepted or sanctioned by 
the british authorities 
british authorities say they want to question some global 
executives when they return from abroad 
the angloamerican probe into the alleged illegal export of 
naval equipment sprang from an 18month investigation by us and 
british police and customs that culminated wednesday in the seizure 
at londons heathrow airport of nuclear components about to be put 
on an iraqi airways flight to baghdad 
three people were charged thursday with trying to export 40 
capacitors essential components in detonating nuclear bombs in 
violation of the export of prohibited goods control act 
iraqi omar latif who said he was an official with stateowned 
iraqi airways was arrested wednesday and will be deported as soon 
as possible home office officials said friday 
iraq denied it bought nuclear triggers and threatened 
retaliatory action if latif is expelled

president bush said friday he had sent a 
confidential letter to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on the 
crisis in lithuania assuring him were not trying to make things 
difficult for either side 
white house officials indicated gorbachev was under intense 
pressure to take a tough line toward the breakaway republic and 
the administration continued trying to take a lowkey approach 
yet in a sign of displeasure gen carl e vuono the us army 
chief of staff postponed a courtesy visit he had been scheduled to 
make to the soviet union 
two us officials demanding anonymity said vuonos host would 
have been the soviet military commander in lithuania and it would 
have been inappropriate for them to meet now 
meanwhile senate republican leader bob dole rkan warned 
that all bets are off if gorbachev resorts to force 
the soviets will be in real trouble here no trade 
agreements no trade preferences and no more of the kind of 
relations the kremlin is desperately seeking from washington 
dole said it would be a severe blow to ussoviet relations 
the white house said bushs message sent through diplomatic 
channels thursday night emphasized us hopes for resolving the 
conflict by peaceful dialogue bush declined to divulge exactly 
what the letter said calling it confidential 
i do not want to risk misunderstanding by failing to 
communicate bush said 
it was bushs first contact with gorbachev since tensions began 
escalating with lithuanias march 11 declaration to secede from the 
soviet union 
i want to be sure that the soviets understand our position and 
understand that were not trying to make things difficult for 
lithuania or the soviet union or anybody else the president 
said talking with reporters at a picturetaking ceremony 
he cited the importance of staying in touch and being sure 
there is no disconnect because of misinformation 
later while playing golf bush was asked if gorbachev had 
replied to his letter what i said doesnt require any 
answer he replied 
the united states has repeatedly voiced support for lithuanias 
right to self determination 
at the same time the bush administration does not want the 
dispute to lead to the removal of gorbachev who has championed 
reforms in the soviet union and paved the way for the flowering of 
democratic governments in eastern europe 
a senior administration official said gorbachev appears to be 
under considerable domestic pressure because of the lithuanian 
crisis 
lithuanias secession by itself would not be a critical 
episode for moscow the official said but if that then becomes 
the symbol for a whole bunch of areas around the periphery of the 
soviet union that would be very difficult 
the official who commented on condition of anonymity said 
it isnt in anybodys interest to have this thing blow up 
the white house has alternated between tough rhetoric and near 
silence about moscows response to lithuania first warning that 
use of force would backfire and disrupt superpower relations and 
then refusing to pass judgment on soviet actions 
maintaining that lowkey approach white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said we have not seen any too many episodes 
in the last few days that have been very dramatic 
but the problem is not resolved he said theyre still 
searching for solutions and were hopeful that can be worked out 
bush has been criticized by some members of congress for not 
being more aggressive in complaining about soviet actions in 
lithuania 
while acknowledging the criticism fitzwater said we believe 
our supporters far outnumber our critics on this issue 
in a display of solidarity with lithuania staged before news 
cameras three conservative senators telephoned president vytautas 
landsbergis with words of encouragement for his struggle against 
moscow 
afterward sen alfonse damato rny said our role is to 
demand independence today even though it may not be possible for 
a month it is to be outspoken i think we can be a useful tool 
for bush and i dont mind lending ourselves for that purpose 
the other senators were republicans frank murkowski of alaska and 
connie mack of florida 
on thursday fitzwater ruled out any direct contact by bush with 
gorbachev saying the president simply feels that this is not the 
time to make a direct contact 
asked about the sudden reversal fitzwater said bush was moved 
by among other things a telephone conversation wednesday with 
british prime minister margaret thatcher and a meeting thursday 
with sen edward m kennedy dmass 
kennedy met with gorbachev in moscow on monday mrs thatcher 
spoke with the soviet leader by telephone this week 
kennedy said gorbachev told him his efforts at reform were being 
undermined by western criticism of his actions in lithuania 
fitzwater said that bush felt this was a time for a personal 
message that used his words and that president gorbachev knew came 
directly from him in expressing our position 
he said bush clearly stated his support and the american 
support for the aspirations of the lithuanian people for 
selfdetermination 
we have expressed our belief and our emphatic view that a 
resolution of this conflict lies in peaceful dialogue fitzwater 
said the presidents message to president gorbachev simply 
reaffirmed our position as stated many times

hundreds of people will remain 
buried near a prison camp first used by the nazis and then by the 
soviets because the dead should rest in peace an official said 
friday 
local officials in oranienburg discovered the remains at the 
site this week after a resident said he saw soviet soldiers gun 
down hundreds of german prisoners there after world war ii 
the nazis ran the prison camp near the town during world war ii 
and the soviets later used it to intern german prisoners after the 
war 
mass grave of unknown victims entry forbidden said the 
sign posted after authorities unearthed dozens more remains on 
friday skeletal parts from 200 to 1000 people some of them 
children have been unearthed officials said 
they said that after more than four decades identification of 
the victims would be extremely difficult and that it would be 
better not to further disturb the remains 
oranienburg authorities have now decided to seal off the mass 
grave said heinz erdmann deputy oranienburg district leader 
the dead should rest in peace they will not be transplanted 
erdmann said 
the site will be turned into a memorial erdmann said 
the camp about 30 miles north of berlin is one of several nazi 
camps later used by the soviets to hold german prisoners 
east german soldiers digging in the wooded area near the site of 
a former camp uncovered the skeletal remains of dozens more people 
friday 
the remains including skulls and nearly intact skeletons 
turned brown apparently from the soil in the region after more than 
40 years under ground 
some of the skeletons apparently were stacked upon each other 
while others were found alone over an area of about 300 square 
yards in the schmachtenhagener woods outside the town 
few clothes or other belongings were found in the area but 
rusted and illegible militarytype dogtag identification 
chains were found among the skeletons soldiers working at the site 
said 
also found were empty shell casings 
the official news agency adn reported this week that officials 
ordered the excavation after a local resident said that in the 
years after 1945 he witnessed naked prisoners being driven to the 
site on trucks 
according to the adn report the prisoners were forced to dig 
their own graves before they were shot and buried they were 
piled on each other like sardines in the graves the report said 
adn said the local prosecutors office in oranienburg has 
recommended that a special government commission be set up to 
investigate the mass burial site 
last weekend east german officials reported that a mass grave 
had been uncovered at fuenfeichen near neubrandenburg another of a 
total of 11 nazi internment camps taken over by the soviets in what 
is now east germany 
the existence of the graves had long been suspected but little 
evidence had surfaced until recently after the old communist 
regime was toppled last fall 
but it was unclear from whether the remains were from the 
postwar soviet era the period of nazi rule or both 
a west german official said 65000 to 70000 german prisoners 
may have died at the postwar soviet camps 
during the nazi era 6 million jews and hundreds of thousands of 
gypsies poles and others were killed

reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints a splinter 
group of the mormon church 
judge james jackson kept bond at 50000 each on the new 
charges the pair were then led in handcuffs back to the lake 
county jail pending april trials 
lake county prosecutor steven latourette said additional charges 
are expected against two other people 
the patricks and 11 others have been charged in the shooting 
deaths last april of dennis avery his wife and their three 
daughters the averys and the 13 people charged in their deaths

latourette alleged that the victims were led one by one into a 
barn bound at the hands and feet with tape and shot to death the 
bodies of avery 49 his wife cheryl 42 and their children 
trina 15 rebecca 13 and karen 7 were exhumed in early

old people suffer more heart disease if their 
blood cholesterol is high and they might benefit by eating less 
fat exercising and losing weight a government study has concluded 
the findings contradict earlier research which made some doctors 
reluctant to advise elderly people to reduce their serum 
cholesterol said dr dwayne reed of the national heart lung and 
blood institute 
the study of 3440 middleaged and 1419 elderly men in hawaii 
showed that a high level of cholesterol in the bloodstream 
increased the risk of future heart disease among 65 to 
74yearolds just as it did for those age 50 to 59 
the 20 percent of men with the highest cholesterol levels were 
17 times more likely to develop heart disease within 12 years than 
the 20 percent of men with the lowest levels regardless of whether 
they were middleaged or elderly when the study started in 1977 
that means people with high cholesterol levels above 240 
milligrams of cholesterol per deciliter of blood should be 
treated the same no matter what age they are he added 
reed an epidemiologist and physician who directs the 
governments honolulu heart program presented the findings 
thursday during an american heart association conference 
he said the results contradict some earlier findings of a famed 
study that started in 1948 and linked high blood cholesterol high 
blood pressure and cigarette smoking to increased heart disease 
among residents of framingham mass for years the study found no 
significant link between heart disease and cholesterol among people 
65 and older 
previous to 198586 we would say it looks like cholesterol is 
weak or nonexistent as a risk factor in the elderly said dr 
peter wilson laboratory director for the framingham study 
thats because there were too few elderly people in the study 
until recent years and their health hadnt been followed long 
enough to reveal the cholesterol hazard he added 
recent analyses of framingham data confirm the hawaii findings 
linking high blood cholesterol and heart disease risk among people 
65 and older but theres been a lag in terms of communication to 
the public wilson said 
wilson said the new study only demonstrates that cholesterol 
raises heart disease risk in elderly people it will be a few years 
before studies determine if their risk can be reduced with 
cholesterollowering drugs or by cutting dietary fat losing weight 
and increasing exercise 
a majority of cholesterol experts believe all adults should 
know your cholesterol level and bring it down if its above 
240 first by dieting for a year then by trying medications shown 
to be safe wilson said people with levels over 300 often need 
medication immediately he said 
he noted that elderly heart disease patients already under a 
doctors care are the most likely targets for such treatment those 
who should be checked for high cholesterol include seniors with 
other coronary risk factors such as high blood pressure cigarette 
smoking or family history of heart disease 
experts are debating whether cholesterol testing would be worth 
the cost for all senior citizens 
seniors with high cholesterol should see a doctor who doesnt 
simply try to reduce total cholesterol but tries to raise 
socalled good cholesterol or hdl while reducing bad 
cholesterol or ldl wilson said 
he urged people to get their cholesterol tested through a doctor 
who draws blood from a vein and has the blood tested by 
sophisticated equipment experts have disputed the accuracy of 
portable testing units that use blood from a finger stick such 
units often are seen in shopping malls 
reed said some doctors still dont urge old people to quit 
cigarettes because of earlier framingham data that found no 
increase in heart disease risk in elderly smokers but wilson said 
most doctors and patients have gotten the message on smoking 
the men in the hawaii study are of japanese ancestry and have 
lower heart disease death rates than white americans reed said 
research has shown that regardless of race the biological causes 
of heart disease are the same and there is no reason to 
believe their biological effect would change as people get older

the mayor of beijing on friday denied authorities 
have warned citizens to stay away from tiananmen square site of 
last springs bloody suppression of the prodemocracy movement to 
prevent protest strolls 
this is the first time i have heard such news the mayor 
chen xitong said when asked at a news conference about the 
reported warnings everyone is allowed to take a walk anywhere 
overseasbased chinese dissident groups have called on students 
and others to stroll through tiananmen on april 1 and april 5 in a 
silent protest against the crackdown of the studentled 
prodemocracy movement last spring 
the groups have suggested casual walks through the square the 
focal point of last years movement because of the certainty that 
police would quickly break up any organized demonstration and 
arrest participants 
chinese sources have reported work units and schools throughout 
the city are telling workers and students to stay away from the 
square on the two designated days 
april 5 is qingming or gravesweeping day the annual day 
when chinese honor their dead it has been suggested students might 
use the occasion to honor hu yaobang the reformist former party 
chief whose death last april 15 touched off the student campaign 
for democratic reform 
in 1976 thousands of people streamed to tiananmen on qingming 
to lay wreathes and flowers honoring chou enlai the beloved 
premier who had died in january the violent suppression of that 
spontaneous movement set the stage for the arrests of the 
ultraleftist gang of four and the end of the cultural 
revolution later that year 
beijing students have received intensive political 
indoctrination and have been under tight surveillance since the 
democracy movement was crushed by military force last june 4 
in private many continue to condemn the repression and 
corruption of the government but say open opposition is unlikely 
under the current harsh political climate 
mayor chen asserted students are studying hard and behaving 
very well he said people who think students are troublemakers 
have the wrong idea the overwhelming majority he said support 
the communist party and the socialist system

soviet reaction to the unrest in 
lithuania prompted the us state department to cancel a soviet 
diplomats speech at a small college here school officials said 
friday 
soviet general consul gennady zolotov was scheduled to speak 
friday evening on changing conditions in his country and improved 
relations with the united states said roz parry a spokeswoman for 
sierra nevada college 
late thursday however parry said the state department which 
must approve any trip of more than 25 miles from the diplomats san 
francisco base told zolotov to stay home the order came after the 
soviets refused to give an american consular official in leningrad 
a travel permit to visit lithuania 
kim lamberty of the state departments soviet section said the 
policy between the two countries remains one of strict reciprocity 
if one nation denies the request of another for an official visit 
the rebuff draws an immediate rejection by the other parry said 
zolotov was next on the list of soviets scheduled for an 
appearance in the us parry said 
its so terminally silly its almost difficult to take it 
seriously said mark hurtubise dean of the 165student liberal 
arts college near lake tahoe 
i would have liked to think that we americans would be able 
to set an example for them in situations like this he said we 
should be playing the role model here not just showing them that 
we can be as silly as they are 
evgueni fokine soviet vice consul in san francisco was 
philosophical about the denial its a matter of reciprocity 
he said it happens 
travel in lithuania is being restricted because of the turmoil 
there he said foreign diplomats have been ordered out because 
of the danger is there turmoil and danger in incline village

soviet troops took over the building 
housing the lithuanian chief prosecutors office late friday after 
staff members refused to work with a moscow loyalist named as new 
chief prosecutor by the kremlin 
the takeover was the first occupation of a government building 
in vilnius since lithuania declared its independence on march 11 
and came as an abrupt reversal by the soviets after initial steps 
by both sides toward a compromise 
soldiers previously had occupied a few communist party buildings 
uniformed men early saturday also moved into lithuanias central 
newspaper printing plant they refused to identify themselves and 
said only that they were protecting the building witnesses said 
they saw at least seven men armed with nightsticks 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said on television the 
decision to take over the prosecutors office brings shame on the 
soviet union 
they are trying to destroy the legal system we have had these 
challenges before we have stood against them and we will do it 
again he said 
premier kazimiera prunskiene told reporters after an emergency 
session of the presidium of the lithuania parliament that the 
government told employees of the prosecutors office to try to work 
in the building under the lithuanian official rather than moscows 
choice 
lithuanian legislator egidius bickauskas said earlier on tv that 
the soviet troops occupied the building with the help of an 
employee he did not elaborate 
a foreign journalist rushed to the scene and said he saw a 
truckload of interior ministry soldiers enter the building 
moscow earlier tried to force lithuania to adhere to soviet law 
by firing lithuanias chief prosecutor arturis paulauskas and 
announcing he would be replaced by antanas petrauskas the chief 
prosecutor is basically a republicwide district attorney 
soviet deputy prosecutor alexei vasiliev made the announcement 
in a conference hall of the prosecutors building in vilnius he 
ordered the 100 staff members to enforce soviet law 
staffers began arguing and shouting at vasiliev and then walked 
out 
hours later the soviet soldiers moved in 
a duty officer at the lithuanian interior ministry said soldiers 
also had arrived at a communist party building the institute of 
party history 
other buildings under military control are the institute of 
marxismleninism the higher party school and communist party 
headquarters all are communist party buildings 
deputy premier kazimieras motieka speaking to reporters 
accused vasiliev of bargaining in bad faith when he met with 
lithuanian officials earlier motieka attended that meeting 
vasiliev spoke politely of compromise with the lithuanians when 
theres no question at that moment they already had this 
planned motieka charged 
he said soldiers told lithuanian interior minister marijonas 
misiukonis they were taking it the buiding over to enforce 
security at the request of vasiliev 
in other developments friday 
byelorussia the republic just south of lithuania demanded the 
return of territory given to lithuania when the republic was 
forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
the republic of estonia also annexed by the kremlin in 1940 
pledged to achieve full independence 
the kgb said it would enforce soviet law in lithuania and 
protect lithuanian citizens who cooperate with it 
the council of the federation a new body of leaders in 
president mikhail s gorbachevs government directed gorbachev to 
tell lithuania that before any talks on secession begin the 
republic must rescind laws contradicting the soviet constitution 
the white house said president bush sent a letter to gorbachev 
emphasizing us hopes the conflict could be resolved peacefully 
bush said the letter assured gorbachev were not trying to make 
things difficult for either side 
the united states has repeatedly voiced support for lithuanias 
right to selfdetermination 
at the same time the united states like other western nations 
does not want the dispute to lead to the removal of gorbachev 
whose reforms have paved the way for democratic governments across 
eastern europe 
byelorussia known for its conservative leadership said 
lithuania was given historically byelorussian territory in a 
halfdozen border regions when soviet officials incorporated 
lithuania and set its borders 50 years ago 
if lithuania secedes we will be forced to insist on the 
return to the byelorussian soviet socialist republic of 
byelorussian land said the statement 
the estonian parliament did not set a date for full independence 
from moscow 
for the past two days both sides in the lithuanian dispute had 
taken steps toward compromise 
the defense ministry on thursday said it would not punish the 
hundreds of lithuanian deserters if they voluntarily returned to 
their units 
on wednesday the lithuanian government said it was halting 
plans to establish a border guard and it advised citizens not to 
resist if soviet authorities came to seize their weapons 
chief military prosecutor alexander katusev said in an interview 
on soviet tv friday that the defense ministry had been out of line 
in offering amnesty 
he said criminal cases had begun against all deserters people 
inciting deserters to leave the armed forces also will be 
prosecuted he said 
the kgb in a statement distributed by the tass news agency 
said officers in lithuania would continue to enforce soviet law and 
guard the border it said a resolution passed tuesday by 
lithuanias legislature demanding citizens stop cooperating with it 
was illegal 
in moscow the council of the federation charged that lithuania 
is stubbornly ignoring soviet law 
it said gorbachev should demand lithuanian laws contradicting 
soviet law be withdrawn before any talks can begin 
soviet foreign ministry officials told most of the few foreign 
journalists remaining in lithuania on friday they would have to 
leave by sunday

britains prince philip said friday 
population growth has created an environmental crisis that could be 
more devastating than any nuclear holocaust if unchecked 
in a speech at the united nations prince philip said the 
problem was caused by human scientific and technological genius 
that led to rampant population growth 
it seems to me that it is about time that these same people 
the leaders in thought in politics and in administration began to 
face the facts and started to make serious efforts to find ways of 
solving the crisis he said 
the fuse of the population bomb has already been ignited and 
the consequences of the explosion for the future of the world will 
be a great deal more devastating than any nuclear holocaust he 
said in the speech sponsored by the un population fund 
prince philip president of the worldwide fund for nature said 
the ecological problems resulting from population growth are 
compounded because the countries facing the most dire circumstances 
are generally the poorest 
the prince recommended more international support for aid 
agencies so they can stabilize world population and avert 
conditions threatening many plant and animal species 
the un population fund estimates the current world population 
is nearly 53 billion people but it projects the figure will be 14 
billion by the year 2100 
prince philip said that while increasing numbers of people is 
the main problem for many poor countries the increasing rate of 
consumption in richer countries also is causing serious trouble 
this leads to the inescapable conclusion that we are eating 
into our capital assets to the detriment of future generations 
he said 
as the forests shrink as the marshes are drained as the 
rivers are polluted as the dams highways railroads factories 
and houses are built so the wildlife loses its habitat and unable 
to find any food and nowhere to breed it just dies out 
prince philip also stressed the need to control hunting and 
fishing to prevent the exploitation of animals 
there can be no doubt that such practices should come under 
some sort of international control but the perpetrators claim that 
the starving millions need the food and that they need the jobs 
he said 
it should not be very difficult to imagine the consequences of 
the indiscriminate exploitation of a dwindling resource in order to 
meet a rising demand

mountain climber sir edmund hillary who 
made history in 1953 by conquering mount everest said friday that 
tourist development since then has destroyed much of the beauty of 
the himalayas 
hillary and other speakers warned of widespread deforestation of 
the mountains in speeches at the opening session of the twoday 
first international conference on environmental protection of the 
himalayas 
the 70yearold new zealander recalled the remote valleys and 
foothills he traveled before he and sherpa guide tenzing norgay 
became the first to reach the top of mount everest on may 29 1953 
in 1951 the people lived a simple hardy existence few of 
them had ever seen a railroad train or a bus tourism was 
unknown hillary said 
nowadays tens of thousands are walking the hills tracks 
floating down the rivers landing in tiny airstrips in remote 
valleys the living standards are increasing but the beautiful 
tracks and valleys have been littered and the forests destroyed 
the conference is sponsored by the himalayan adventure trust 
which hillary helped found two years ago and by the indian 
mountaineering foundation 
hillary said tourism in the himalayas must be spread more thinly 
and visitors must take their trash with them when they leave 
tourist agents must be pressured to make sure their customers 
leave the hills and valleys beautiful he said 
he said huge population increases have sent more farmers into 
the himalayas in search of survival the local people are forced 
higher and higher to cut trees and make terraces for their crops 
when will it ever stop he asked 
maneka gandhi indias minister of state for environment and 
forests warned that deforestation and pollution would have 
disastrous results reaching far beyond the himalayan highlands 
today the himalayas are crumbling said mrs gandhi 
sisterinlaw of former prime minister rajiv gandhi the 
disappearance of the himalayas will mean the desertification of 
india and neighboring areas we have to preserve the himalayas or 
we perish 
she said the new government of prime minister vp singh was 
considering a 175 million plan to regreen the himalayas

viewed as a possible sabotage attempt 
claymores 350 staff live and work on the installation 260 on 
the platform the rest on the adjoining support vessel tharos

act which suggests the presence of someone on board the platform 
who has no respect for the safety of his fellow workers we will 
not tolerate this behavior 
it said it summoned police and also notified the department of 
energy the company said it was withholding further information at 
police request

garrison keillor the softspoken humorist 
known for his fond pokes at smalltown america told a senate panel 
thursday that governmentfunded artists should be more provocative 
i wish there were more of the controversial projects 
keillor told the senate labor and human resources subcommittee on 
education arts and humanities 
the subcommittee is studying the renewal of the nea which has 
been at the center of a controversy because of taxpayerfunded 
exhibits of works judged by some to be pornographic and insulting 
to religion 
speaking of his early struggles as a writer keillor said i 
remember very well when nobody else was but my mother and the 
national endowment was interested 
defenders say only 20 projects out of 85000 receiving nea 
funding in the last quarter century have been controversial 
i think that that small number out of 85000 is a remarkable 
testament to how timid and selfrepressed artists have become he 
said 
he warned lawmakers against tying strings to funding saying 
if congress doesnt do something about obscene art well have to 
build galleries twice as big to hold the people who want to go see 
it and if congress does do something about obscene art the 
galleries will need to be even bigger than that

prime minister margaret thatcher said friday she 
has agreed with chancellor helmut kohl of west germany that nuclear 
weapons must remain in europe after the germanys are unified 
but kohl refused to commit himself to her insistence that west 
germanbased nato nuclear missiles aimed at east germany should 
remain after unification 
we both agreed that the presence of nuclear weapons on 
european soil and i think german soil is the preferred soil for 
american nuclear weapons is vital mrs thatcher said sitting 
next to kohl at a news conference winding up his twoday visit to 
britain 
kohl said i think in the future too we need full protection 
of nato for the territory of germany 
but he did not say outright that he wanted nato nuclear weapons 
to stay on german soil after unification and mrs thatcher 
acknowledged her talks with kohl were held in a rapidly changing 
situation 
we have not in fact got down to the details that will be 
negotiated through nato she said 
while insisting that germany wanted to map out its future in 
close cooperation with the north atlantic treaty organization and 
its european community partners kohl gave no clearcut reply when 
asked if nuclear weapons should stay in germany 
i think the world has changed and within nato we will have to 
draw the consequences in reasonable discussions he said 
kohl said germany sought no special status or treatment within 
nato and did not want to be neutral or demilitarized 
but he said that in negotiations to reduce conventional 
chemical and shortrange nuclear weapons i think that we can now 
achieve enormous progress progress that would have been 
unthinkable one or two years ago 
kohl reiterated that his goal was political unification of 
europe something mrs thatcher opposes 
he said he was not angered by those who say european unity is 
vital to control the might of a united germany 
we dont mind this argument even if it is not very 
flattering because its the goal that counts he said

the man accused of killing 87 people by torching 
an illegal social club in a jealous rage was indicted on 178 counts 
of murder arson and other charges friday 
a state grand jury indicted julio gonzalez on one count of 
seconddegree murder and one count of murder in the commission of a 
felony for each person killed inside the happy land social club in 
the bronx 
he also was indicted on two counts of arson and single counts of 
attempted murder and assault the defendant wasnt present when the 
indictment was returned 
gonzalez 36 who is due back in court april 12 could face a 
sentence of 25 years to life if convicted on all counts in the 
case said assistant district attorney eric warner if a judge made 
the sentences run consecutively he could receive a 2000year term 
no case is open and shut warner said we have a very good 
case the evidence is strong 
bronx district attorney robert johnson said it is 
conceivable that gonzalez could be convicted of two murder 
counts for each victim but he said a jury probably would have to 
choose between the two 
gonzalez a cuban immigrant opted against testifying before the 
panel said his courtappointed attorney richard w berne 
while the grand jury considered the charges authorities 
released records indicating that one of the clubs landlords was 
contacted by a fire lieutenant eight months before the blaze and 
told a vacate order was in effect against the building 
morris jaffe a partner in little peach realty responded that 
the problem would be taken care of according to a july 28 
1989 fire department document jaffe and jay weiss the husband of 
actress kathleen turner are partners in little peach 
jaffe didnt return telephone messages left at his office friday 
seeking comment on the report 
weiss jaffe and their company were named in two more 
multimilliondollar negligence lawsuits filed friday on behalf of 
the families of fire victims also named were the club itself the 
buildings owner of record alex dilorenzo and the city of new 
york 
one lawsuit asks for 100 million in damages the second asks 
for 57 million both were filed in manhattans federal court the 
day before a 510 million lawsuit was filed by the mother of 
another victim 
friday was the deadline for an indictment of gonzalez who has 
been held on murder and arson charges since sunday he had not 
entered a plea in the case because he hadnt been indicted 
gonzalez brought to court earlier in the day on another matter 
was returned to bellevue hospital where he was under 24hour 
watch a shotgunwielding correction officer accompanied the 
suspect back and forth from the court and no other prisoners are 
permitted within 20 feet of him at bellevue his lawyer said 
berne said he hoped to arrange a psychiatric examination for 
gonzalez soon 
obviously one potential avenue of defense is psychiatric 
said berne its always a possible defense now im looking 
through doors and i will decide which door i want to walk 
through 
berne said gonzalez was exhausted when they met thursday night 
imagine what hes been through hes very tired berne told 
reporters at state court in the bronx 
gonzalez enraged by a girlfriends rejection spilled gasoline 
in the entrance to the happy land social club early sunday and set 
it ablaze authorities said eightyseven patrons died inside the 
cramped club which catered largely to immigrants from honduras 
his attorney said he was going into the case without any 
preconceptions 
all you hear at this stage is the worst of everything i 
wouldnt be a very good lawyer if i rendered a decision on what 
ive read in the newspapers berne said 
the red cross was preparing a charter flight to carry more than 
40 bodies back to honduras saturday in albany the new york 
national guard said the honduran government had withdrawn a request 
for its help in transporting victims bodies 
six victims were buried friday at st raymonds cemetery in the 
bronx and dozens of mourners attended a wake friday evening for 
three others 
one of the few patrons to survive the fire meanwhile was 
interviewed about the scene at happy land when the fire broke out 
felipe figueroa said the clubs disc jockey ruben valladares 
was playing a jamaican reggae song when the club doorman rushed up 
the deadly narrow staircase yelling fuego fuego or fire 
fire 
right away people went crazy he said in the interview with 
the new york times everybody was running around 
he said he made his way down a narrow staircase and out the 
door and then saw valladares who was a friend of his come out in 
flames the disc jockey remains hospitalized with burns over 40 
percent of his body 
my mind cant stop figueroa said all the screams all 
the noise and the moment when my friend came out of there 
screaming i cant forget that 
authorities are unsure how many people survived but most 
accounts put the number at five or six

organizations led by former labor secretary 
ray marshall asked a court on thursday to make president bush deny 
trade privileges to countries that violate their citizens labor 
rights 
the lawsuit was filed in the us district court for the 
district of columbia it did not name countries but a press 
statement said the organizations have documents to show violations 
in guatemala el salvador malaysia haiti the philippines 
thailand turkey and indonesia among others 
about 140 areas are privileged to ship some of their products to 
the united states dutyfree or at reduced duties under what is 
called the generalized system of preferences the reduced duties 
allow the products to be sold in this country at lower prices than 
similar goods from other countries the system is designed to help 
the third world countries develop their industries 
the law setting up the system limits the benefits to countries 
that respect internationally recognized worker rights these 
include a ban on child labor special provisions for women the 
right to form labor unions and others 
under this provision us authorities have banned nicaragua 
romania and burma from the program and suspended paraguay chile 
and the central african republic marshall and the other 
complainants consider that inadequate 
the bush administrations refusal to enforce the law gives 
large multinational firms a windfall at the expense of both 
american and foreign workers marshall said in a statement 
businesses can earn great profits in developing countries 
relatively free from labor regulation export their products 
dutyfree to the us market displace american workers and take 
advantage of unprotected foreign workers 
the complaint was filed by the aflcio and 22 other labor unions 
and private groups including marshalls own international labor 
rights education and research fund an advocacy group it asked the 
court to interpret the law and to order bush and his administration 
to review the rights of labor in all the countries that benefit 
from it 
the office of us trade representative carla hills said the 
action had been signalled in advance but it had no comment bush 
and six members of his cabinet named as defendants including ms 
hills have 60 days to reply

urging the governor of california to stop the scheduled april 3 
execution of robert alton harris convicted of killing two 
teenagers in 1978

shall not kill a group that campaigns against the death penalty 
it was addressed to gov george deukmejian and signed by 200

the petition described harris personal story as terrifying 
noting that he was born prematurely after his father kicked his 
alcoholic mother and that he was beaten as a young child 
it urged deukmejian to leave inactive your states gas chamber 
to give the world an example of civility to affirm the coherence 
of the choice of democracy to respect the international treaties 
on human rights

16yearold san diego boys 12 years ago he would become the first 
person executed in california since 1967

the prosecutor at john poindexters trial 
asked jurors in final arguments friday to ignore former president 
reagans biased testimony and convict his national security 
adviser of irancontra coverup charges 
but poindexters attorney said the defendant had merely gotten 
caught in a political battle between congress and the white house 
and had done his everloving best to give as much information as 
he could tell rather than conspiring to hide the affair 
poindexter had done his job for reagan the driving engine 
behind his actions said defense lawyer richard beckler 
prosecutor dan k webb said in his summation that there was 
overwhelming evidence that poindexter lied to congress and 
destroyed documents to cover up the diversion of iran arms sale 
profits to help the nicaraguan contra rebels when aid was banned by 
congress 
webb ridiculed the defenses decision to call reagan as its 
star witness calling it an attempt to persuade jurors to 
ignore the facts 
reagan didnt have the slightest clue whether poindexter 
participated in the crimes charged in the indictment webb said 
the defense hoped that just because the president testified 
you ought to acquit john poindexter webb said that defense is 
an insult to your intelligence 
poindexters attorney told jurors that reagan resisted 
testifying and did not come as a friendly witness he defended 
the former presidents value as a witness saying the fact he 
forgot some things does not mean his testimony was not relevant 
the eight hours of reagans videotaped testimony taken in 
february in los angeles was played for the jury last week by the 
defense which rested its case wednesday without calling poindexter 
to the stand 
the case which began with jury selection march 5 is expected 
to go to the jury monday after the judge gives his final 
instructions 
beckler told jurors friday that poindexter a retired navy rear 
admiral should not have to pay for the misdeeds of his former 
aide oliver l north who was convicted of charges last year 
if oliver north did something wrong that is oliver norths 
responsibility that is not admiral poindexters responsibility 
said beckler who tried to paint north as a renegade operator in 
the irancontra affair 
there were absolutely many things that admiral poindexter 
didnt know oliver north was doing beckler said 
poindexter was not a member of some grimy little conspiracy 
that the prosecution would have you believe beckler said 
he is a victim of a concerted action by congress working 
handinhand with the independent counsels office to try to do 
something with this political battle between congress and the 
white house beckler said 
through much of becklers 2hour summation poindexters wife 
linda sat in the front row of the spectators gallery holding 
4yearold grandson zachary on her lap 
prosecutor webb attacked reagans testimony saying ronald 
reagan didnt seem to remember anything in this case and 
demonstrated bias at one point by turning and winking at poindexter 
when people come into court we expect them to give fair and 
truthful testimony webb said but when a person is so biased 
he turns to wink at someone as if to say did that last answer help 
you john i would have expected more from a former president 
than that webb said 
webb ridiculed reagans defense of three letters poindexter sent 
to congress in july 1986 which the prosecution charges falsely 
deny that the national security council staff was secretly 
orchestrating arms shipments to the contras 
the prosecutor recalled that when reagan was shown one of the 
letters the former president said he agreed with its contents and 
added i would have added in a profanity 
he gave that testimony because he hoped it would help john 
poindexter webb said he hadnt the foggiest idea those were 
false letters sent to obstruct congress 
beckler argued the letters were in fact truthful he said 
reagan mentioned including profanity in the response because the 
lawmakers request for information as nothing more than an 
attempt by congress to take a shot at the administrations position 
on contra support 
webb reminded jurors that on crossexamination reagan said he 
never authorized poindexter to lie or destroy documents 
webb a former us attorney in chicago appointed by reagan 
argued that poindexter tore up a document authorizing us 
involvement in iranian arms sales to protect reagan from political 
embarrassment 
this is the one document in the world that puts the lie to 
what ronald reagan told the american people when he denied in a 
nov 13 1986 speech that he had sold arms to iran to try to free 
american hostages webb said 
the document an intelligence finding signed by reagan in 
december 1985 authorized the cias involvement a month earlier in 
the shipment of hawk missiles to iran it described the transaction 
as an effort to free us hostages 
webb said that poindexter after lying to two congressional 
committees on nov 21 1986 about usiran arms sales returned 
to his office and he tore up the original finding signed by the 
president of the united states 
the prosecutor ripping up a copy of the document to dramatize 
his point said the act of tearing up that finding is strong 
evidence poindexter intended to obstruct congress 
webb said it was not a coincidence that both poindexter and 
thencia director william casey who died in 1987 lied to congress 
that day about the 1985 hawk shipment that was an obstruction of 
congress by two of the highest ranking people in the government of 
our nation the prosecutor said 
poindexter who served as reagans national security adviser 
from late 1985 until his resignation on nov 25 1986 is also 
accused of deceiving congress about white house involvement in 
covert assistant to the nicaraguan rebels 
webb recounted norths testimony that he was generally 
instructed by poindexter to lie to lawmakers about the secret aid 
network 
north was there because the defendant on trial in this case 
his commander sent him there to do that webb said the boss 
cant escape legal responsibility just because he didnt get his 
hands dirty

a federal appeals judge on friday blocked 
next tuesdays scheduled execution of convicted double murderer 
robert alton harris who would have become the first inmate 
executed in california in 23 years 
harris convicted of shooting two teenage boys to death in 1978 
to use their car in a robbery may not have had competent 
psychiatric help at the time of his trial said judge john noonan 
of the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
it is reasonably arguable and we cannot determine from this 
record whether harris received competent psychiatric assistance 
said noonan 
his order issued after a 50minute hearing would spare harris 
the gas chamber to allow arguments before a threejudge panel of 
the court on whether the convict should get an evidentiary hearing 
that process normally takes several months 
in sacramento attorney general john van de kamp said he would 
ask the us supreme court to lift the stay 
its potentially possible to get it lifted before tuesday 
said chief assistant attorney general richard iglehart 
we would argue that its impossible for psychiatrists to go 
back and review what other psychiatrists did years ago said van 
de kamp 
the decision creates a brandnew legal right for accused 
murderers like robert harris the right to challenge the 
competency of psychiatric experts years after the fact we believe 
this reading of the law is in error 
michael mccabe one of harris lawyers said were very happy 
that our clients life has been spared were pleased that judge 
noonan was not stampeded by the wave of public attention 
generated here 
harris 37 would be the first person executed in california 
since 1967 he came within four days of execution once before in 
1982 
this stuns me how many times does this guy have to be turned 
down said william stalder uncle of john mayeski one of harris 
victims this just keeps the wound open it keeps us waiting and 
waiting 
noonan a conservative appointee of former president ronald 
reagan said his order was a vindication of the state and federal 
interest that no one be put to death without due process of law 
he said us district judge william enright of san diego who 
turned down harris lastditch appeal wednesday should have held a 
factfinding hearing on new psychiatric evidence submitted by the 
defense 
that evidence includes reports by psychologists who concluded 
that the psychiatric consultants who assisted harris trial lawyer 
acted incompetently by failing to test for brain damage or other 
serious mental disorders 
enright had rejected those conclusions without an evidentiary 
hearing he said the dispute amounted to a mere disagreement among 
experts wasnt the fault of the state and wouldnt have affected 
the jurys decision 
it takes two votes on the threemember appellate panel to return 
the case to enright for an evidentiary hearing noonans order if 
it stands would block the execution and allow further written 
arguments and a hearing before the full panel to decide on an 
evidentiary hearing 
harris current appeal filed after the us supreme court 
turned him down for the fourth time this january is based largely 
on examinations that concluded he had organic brain damage and 
other mental disorders that affected his ability to control his 
impulses 
harris was convicted in 1979 of killing john mayeski and michael 
baker both 16 in san diego in july 1978 
he had abducted the boys at gunpoint from a drivein restaurant 
as they sat in their parked cars he forced them to drive to a 
remote area where he shot them so he could use their car in a bank 
robbery 
in last weeks appeal harris lawyers challenged the evaluation 
of a state mental health expert who characterized the defendant as 
a sociopath incapable of remorse or rehabilitation they also 
claimed that abuse in childhood and his mothers heavy drinking 
during her pregnancy with him exacerbated harris mental disorders

the former manager of a failed credit union 
is mentally incompetent to stand trial on federal charges stemming 
from allegations he diverted money for his own use a magistrate 
said friday 
lawrence e king jr understands the nature and consequences of 
the charges against him but would be unable to help in his defense 
in what is expected to be a long trial us magistrate richard 
kopf said 
king 45 a prominent businessman who sang the national anthem 
at the 1984 republican national convention is charged with 
conspiracy fraud and filing false tax returns in the failure of 
franklin community federal credit union 
kopf said he would recommend that king be kept in federal 
custody and taken to the us medical center for federal prisoners 
at rochester minn for treatment 
the magistrate based his decision on a report prepared by dr 
dorsey dysart chief psychiatrist at the us medical center in 
springfield mo who has diagnosed king as suffering from 
probable delusional paranoid disorder grandiose type 
a patient with such a disorder believes he has great powers to 
do things other people cant 
kopf said the psychiatrist noted that the intellectual system 
of grandiosity leads to disorganization of thought processes which 
gravely impairs the ability of mr king to withstand a lengthy 
trial 
king faces 40 counts in from the failure of the franklin 
community federal union officials said 39 million was missing 
from the credit union which had been established to help north 
omahas poor when it was closed on nov 4 1988 
kings wife alice also faces charges stemming from the credit 
unions failure 
soon after it failed stories began surfacing of alleged sexual 
abuse at parties thrown by credit union officials authorities who 
first investigated didnt file any such charges but the 
allegations were aired in a legislative investigation and the 
matter was taken up by a county grand jury 
king hasnt been charged with any such offense 
the magistrate said he would recommend to us district judge 
william g cambridge that king be committed to a hospital for 
treatment generally consisting of antipsychotic medication and 
psychotherapy in addition kopf will ask that a report be given to 
the court within four months on whether king could face trial in 
the foreseeable future 
kopf also set a monday deadline for any objections to the order 
alan stoler who represented king in the competency proceedings 
said he does not expect to appeal the magistrates findings 
two other courtappointed attorneys defending king against the 
criminal charges steven achelpohl and marilyn abbott said they 
will not appeal the ruling 
us attorney ron lahners said the prosecution agrees that king 
is not competent to stand trial and he expects cambridge to sign 
the order soon 
its in the best interest of the defendant to get back into 
treatment lahners said 
king however believes he is competent to stand trial kopf 
said

gov cecil andrus confronted with thousands 
of pleas and a threatened potato boycott by opponents of idahos 
abortion bill on friday vetoed what would have been the most 
restrictive state abortion law 
the veto ended the hopes of antiabortion groups who wanted to 
use an idaho law to challenge the us supreme courts commitment 
to legalized abortion embodied in its 1973 roe v wade decision 
andrus an antiabortion governor who said he agonized over 
provisions of the legislation explained his decision by saying the 
bill does not provide a woman and her family any flexibility in 
cases of rape and incest 
the bill is drawn so narrowly that it would punitively and 
without compassion further harm an idaho woman who may find herself 
in the horrible unthinkable position of confronting a pregnancy 
that resulted from rape or incest he said in a written statement 
read at a 5 pm news conference 
the veto effectively killed the bill since state legislators 
had conceded they did not have enough votes to gain the twothirds 
majority needed to override the veto in addition the legislature 
adjourned its session at 432 pm friday and can be called back 
only by the governor 
but republican rep gary montgomery one of the bills main 
architects said antiabortion lawmakers would refine the 
legislation and press it again in the 1991 session 
the veto is the most significant demonstration to date of the 
power depth and intensity of the prochoice movement said kate 
michelman executive director of the national abortion rights 
action league in washington dc 
but she warned that the abortionrights movement remains 
vulnerable 
despite our victories it only takes one antichoice 
legislature to pass one antichoice testcase bill that is signed 
into law by one antichoice governor for the right to choose to be 
stripped from every american woman ms michelman said it will 
only take one case to challenge roe in the us supreme court 
john willke president of the national right to life committee 
said 
gov andrus today abandoned thousands of unborn children who 
will continue to die needlessly in idaho he has bowed to the 
hollow threats and pressure tactics of proabortion extremists who 
insist abortion be available as a method of birth control 
willke said the veto is not only unprincipled but politically 
unwise this veto will galvanize the prolife majority in idaho and 
nationwide 
andrus who is running for an unprecedented fourth term said he 
had consulted with legal scholars of both political parties who 
said there was not the remotest chance of the supreme court 
upholding such a law 
he also said the financial burden for the state to defend the 
bill in court would have been excessive with estimates running as 
high as 15 million 
the bill called for outlawing abortion except in cases of 
nonstatutory rape reported within seven days incest if the victim 
is under 18 severe fetal deformity or a threat to the life or 
health of the woman 
the governor had said thursday he was concerned that other women 
who have been raped victimized by incest or faced a threat to 
their own lives might not be able to obtain a justified abortion 
on friday andrus said many of his own reservations about the 
bill which would have banned more than 90 percent of the 1500 
abortions performed in idaho each year were known to lawmakers as 
they considered it 
but all were shunted aside in the frenzy to pass a bill that 
by the sponsors own admission was conceived outside of our state 
for the sole purpose of getting this issue back before the supreme 
court he said 
i believe and i am confident the people of idaho believe 
that we can make our own judgments on this terribly important issue 
without outside pressure and outside influence or threats andrus 
said 
the governor has repeatedly reaffirmed his opposition to 
abortion except in cases of rape incest and to save the womans 
life 
right to life spokesman douglas johnson said his group was not 
sure where it would now turn to test roe v wade with many state 
legislatures declining to take on the issue despite a supreme court 
ruling last year that allowed them to impose some restrictions 
a new law in the us territory of guam prohibits abortions 
except when a pregnancy endangers a womans life and is currently 
the target of a classaction lawsuit in pennsylvania sections of 
a tough law restricting abortions have been stayed by a judge 
because of challenges from abortionrights groups 
the debate over the idaho bill promised to spill over into 
coming gubernatorial campaign 
johnson said antiabortion forces would support an antiabortion 
opponent if the threeway republican primary yields one two of the 
three challengers oppose abortion 
ms michelman of the national abortionrights group said the 
organization would back andrus in his campaign despite his 
continued opposition to abortion 
we will be there to support him and the people of idaho will 
support him because a majority of the people of idaho disagreed 
with what the legislature did ms michelman said 
before the veto was announced andrus remained closeted in his 
inner office as staff members handled a tide of phone messages 
which were running 2to1 for a veto of the bill 
there are only so many lines receptionist jean jewell said 
we couldnt handle any more 
since the bill banning abortion as a method of birth control 
cleared its first major legislative hurdle in the house three weeks 
ago more than 21000 telephone calls letters and petitions came 
into the office 
since wednesday morning the staff had begun counting 
outofstate calls separately they were running about three times 
greater than those from idahoans 
abortionrights groups led by the national organization for 
women had called for a boycott of idaho products if andrus signed 
the measure the focus of the boycott would have been idahos 
potato crop a mainstay of the states economy 
in response antiabortion activists began mailing potatoes to 
now 
in a separate development a nebraska legislator who favors 
abortionrights began a filibuster friday after antiabortion 
forces tried to bring up a bill requiring a minor to notify her 
parents before getting an abortion 
antiabortion groups had hoped the idaho bill could give the 
us supreme court the opportunity to reverse roe vs wade its 
1973 decision legalizing abortion 
since the night before final legislative approval last week 
abortionrights forces have staged candlelight vigils on the 
capitol steps urging a veto

a state appeals court issued a decision three 
days before a bronx social club fire that probably strengthens the 
victims families chances of successfully suing the owner or 
landlord of the fire site 
one victims mother has already sued the owners lessees and 
proprietors of the club for 510 million her lawyer said thursday 
many other relatives of the 87 people who died already have 
contacted lawyers 
but their success seems to depend on their ability to collect 
from the only potential defendants with substantial assets or 
insurance the buildings owner alex dilorenzo and its 
landlords jay weiss and morris jaffe 
the families case appears to have been buttressed by a march 22 
ruling by a state appeals court 
in a 32 decision the panel ruled that an owner of real estate 
who allows it to be used for an unlawful purpose can be liable for 
damages caused by the illegal activity to innocent people who are 
not tenants 
the case involved 9yearold miguel muniz who was blinded by 
stray gunfire from a harlem building that had been a center of drug 
dealing the appellate panel reversed a judge who had ruled that 
the landlord could not be held liable for damages 
aaron broder the lawyer who represented the boy and is advising 
plaintiffs lawyers in the social club case said courts have 
tended to rule that unless harm to an innocent third party flowed 
from a building defect over which a landlord had direct control 
the landlord could not be held liable 
the social club was the scene of arrests for illegal alcohol 
sales and was repeatedly cited for building and safety code 
violations including the lack of fire alarms sprinklers and 
emergency exits the citys buildings department finally ordered it 
closed a copy of the order was tacked to the clubs front door 
and at least one copy was supposed to have been sent to dilorenzo 
or weiss and jaffe 
the chain of control begins with dilorenzo who owns the 
building and gave a 30year lease to weiss and jaffe they in 
turn leased the premises to elias colon who operated the social 
club 
since colon died in the fire and is not thought to have had 
substantial assets or insurance plaintiffs attorneys will focus 
on the owner and the landlord arguing that they were aware or 
should have been aware of the illegal uses of the premises and 
should have done something 
the muniz case is particularly relevant because as in the case 
of the social club the landlord already had gone to court seeking 
the tenants eviction for nonpayment of rent not for breaking any 
law or regulation 
the court in muniz held that if a landlord has sought to 
evict a tenant for nonpayment and does not choose to seek eviction 
for other reasons its evidence of his potential negligence 
broder said 
the landlord demonstrated he was capable of using the courts 
but only when it was profitable to him 
but a real estate lawyer flora schnall said the fact weiss and 
jaffe were trying to evict colon was more important than why 
nonpayment of rent she said is the easiest thing to evict 
someone for its very difficult to evict someone for illegal 
uses

house democrats are tempting a presidential 
veto by rejecting the white house version of a childcare bill in 
favor of their own more costly and ambitious plan 
the house approved the measure estimated to cost at least 27 
billion over its first five years just hours after a spokesman for 
president bush issued a fresh veto threat thursday 
rather than waving his veto pen our president should match 
his warm words with good deeds and agree to sign our childcare 
bill house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said after 
the vote 
the bill still must go to a housesenate conference to resolve 
differences with the senate but democrats hoped the ultimate 
version would mirror the house bill and that electionyear 
pressures would make bush back down from his threat

at a small center with a single launch 
pad in the hills of uchinoura scientists are trying to make japan 
a leader in space 
private japanese companies count on them to succeed and have 
elaborate plans ranging from mines on the moon to a doughnutshaped 
orbiting hotel that would make its own gravity 
the government is known for targeting new technologies with 
wellfinanced research programs but uchinouras budget is small 
scientists stretch it by doing the work of technicians even 
checking the rockets 
staff members shiver during winter liftoffs because building 
heaters are shut down so the limited electrical supply can power 
the launch equipment 
despite years of trailing the united states and soviet union in 
both glamor and spending the japanese space industry has built a 
respected technical foundation and is aiming toward its own manned 
space program 
scientists at uchinouras institute of space and astronautical 
science put a satellite into lunar orbit march 19 using a small 
m3s2 rocket that made japan only the third nation to probe the 
moon 
japans other governmentfinanced space organization the 
national space development agency testfired a sophisticated 
engine march 7 for the h2 rocket which will compete with us 
soviet and european rockets in payload capacity 
so far japanese aerospace companies usually have been 
subcontractors for overseas firms or have manufactured products 
under foreign licenses 
in the past other nations took the initiative in space and 
japan participated passively but in the future japan will take the 
lead more often said tomifumi godai director of the space 
development agency 
as with many earlier industrial successes japan has avoided 
expensive space failures by licensing proven technology and 
gradually improving on it 
its the same old story says keisuke kasagi a senior 
analyst in tokyo for wi carr securities japan developed 
everything from foreign technology and then went on to develop its 
own domestic technology 
the workhorse h1 rocket uses 25yearold us delta technology 
developed by mcdonnell douglas with japanese improvements that 
include a new secondstage engine 
mcdonnell douglas recently asked mitsubishi heavy industries 
chief contractor on the h1 to supply it with the new engines for 
us rockets according to japanese space officials 
when i attend international meetings these days im often 
asked by other countries whether we will sell them technology 
godai told reporters 
an important gauge of that technology will be whether japan can 
complete development of the h2 rocket independently the engine 
caught fire in two tests last year delaying the first flight until 
at least march 1993 
having its own rockets would free japan from a 1969 agreement 
under which the united states can veto launching of satellites for 
third countries 
support for more independence may grow following discord over 
joint development plans with the united states for the fsx fighter 
plane discovery of design problems in a usled international 
space station project and the explosion feb 22 of a european 
ariane rocket carrying two japanese communications satellites worth 
about 600 million 
both satellites on the ariane were made in the united states 
american trade officials have threatened penalty tariffs on 
japanese products unless japan agrees to buy more us satellites 
instead of supporting development of the domestic satellite 
industry 
its hard to believe this great nation which produces so many 
goods so well has to protect an infant industry like satellites 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said on a recent visit to japan 
some analysts question whether japan will become competitive in 
commercial launches 
its two small space centers at uchinoura and nearby 
tanegashima are far from the equator that increases launching 
costs for geostationary satellites which must be placed in orbits 
over the equator 
already there are wellestablished commercially viable launch 
programs in the united states europe the soviet union and 
china said stephen marvin an analyst for jardine fleming 
securities japan wont have the economies of scale to make it 
costeffective 
whatever the analysts say japanese space space plans are 
ambitious 
over the next 10 years the government program calls for 
creating a small space shuttle probes of the moon and venus to 
prepare for manned missions and building a 2 billion module for 
the space station 
most experiments in the module will involve processing materials

you can feel it in lee iacoccas vow to peel off 
their teflon kimonos 
its there in the hearty applause for johnny carsons monologues 
about their voracious appetite for american real estate and jay 
lenoscracks about their proposed takeover of 7eleven those are 
only among the most visible signs 
theres nothing new about japanbashing which has been around 
since well before pearl harbor but racially charged hostility 
toward the oncesubdued japanese and their postwar economic might 
seems less subtle and more fearladen now some would argue its 
becoming bold and belligerent 
ironically the antijapanese jibes have been accompanied and 
even overshadowed by a growing sophistication and respect for japan 
in many parts of the country 
american companies often strive to copy japanese models for 
success japanese companies are building factories and opening 
offices in the united states contributing to charities and 
striving to be responsible corporate citizens japanese language 
study has grown enormously popular 
from cinema to sports to sushi bars japanese culture is 
integrating into the american mainstream and embellishing its 
diversity one of japans star athletes ice skater midori ito is 
a darling of the american sports press on monday night an 
honorary oscar was awarded to japans akira kurosawa considered 
one of the greatest living film directors 
at the same time however the tone and nature of japanbashing 
has changed tapping into some deeply ingrained prejudices held by 
an older generation of americans who never really thought of the 
japanese as friends 
this change is not an isolated event it comes against a 
background of seemingly intractable disputes between the united 
states and japan over a number of crucial economic issues that have 
redefined our postwar relationship 
the united states long has wanted japan to open its market to 
foreign goods and help alleviate a growing trade deficit washington 
claims is undermining the productivity and competitiveness of 
domestic industries 
but japan is becoming less patient with this argument it wants 
americans to stop spending beyond their means and clean up social 
malignancies that range from illiteracy to drug abuse this 
response seems only to have further inflamed the ire of the 
japanbashers 
true you dont often hear the wartime epithet jap at least 
in public but you do read and hear cultural slights against the 
japanese which if applied to some other ethnic group would be 
construed as racial slurs 
perhaps the most obvious example is an advertising campaign by 
iacocca the chrysler corp boss who is seeking to stimulate the 
car companys sales with a tribal usvsthem pitch that paints the 
japanese as devious crafty copycats 
a lot of americans think if its made in japan its terrific 
if its made in america its lousy he rails on television and 
print ads its time to peel off the teflon kimono 
iacocca whose company by the way imports and sells many 
japanese cars under its own nameplates has denied that his 
remarks are antijapanese much less racially inspired on the 
contrary iacocca claims hes one of japans greatest fans 
but the timing of his publicity drive and the almost bellicose 
nature of his language suggests hes pandering to prejudices about 
japan as though they were a threat to apple pie america 
other prominent americans from congressmen to governors to 
talkshow hosts have engaged in the same sort of rhetoric spicing 
it up with gratuitous and uncomplimentary references to the 
japanese way of life even the press has chimed in 
when a japanese company agreed earlier this month to acquire 
debtladen southland corps 7eleven stores for example some 
news reports focused more on who the buyer was than why the seller 
was desperate for a financial rescue and sought a japanese savior 
one newspaper account began with the line sushi slurpees

last winter ryuichi sakamoto turned on the tv 
in his los angeles hotel room and heard some familiar music 
fascinating he thought the orchestration the 
instrumentation how the french horns used high octave violin 
phrases 
it was the theme from bonanza 
im always looking for something which can inspire me said 
sakamoto who composed the academy awardwinning soundtrack to the 
the last emperor and has released a new album beauty 
when i listen to any music i automatically see musical notes 
and instruments in films just one tone a sound could mean a 
lot he said 
bonanza inspired sakamoto to purchase a compilation of 
themes from westerns which played softly in the background during 
a recent interview at a manhattan hotel he came to new york well 
prepared for any unexpected musical adventure on the dresser by 
his bed sat a compact disc player a digital audio tape machine and 
tapes of everything from reggae to jazz 
nicknamed professor in college sakamoto is like a sonic 
henry higgins able to tell the difference between hong kong and 
moscow by the pitch of car horns born in tokyo in 1952 he was 
just 10 when he began studying music composition at the university 
of art of tokyo 
but sakamoto is a proudly selftrained listener recalling his 
daily commutes to high school 
i paid attention to every noise on the train and counted every 
different noise spins boxes crashing people talking cable 
wires said sakamto who identified each sound with an uncanny 
imitation 
echoes of cities are different the first time i went to 
london i was kind of surprised i flew from tokyo to london and 
the echoes the cities had were very different said the composer 
whose debut album thousand knives was released in 1978 
in london the buildings were made out of stones the steps 
sounded very different to me very hypnotic 
sakamoto admits however that keeping his ears pinned to 
grindstone left him tonedeaf to people softspoken and shy he 
simply preferred listening to talking sounds over words the 
turning point he said came in 1987 when he worked with director 
bernardo bertolucci on the last emperor 
it was quite tricky because my musics kind of depressed and 
flat on the surface bertolucci forced me to write more and more 
emotional music he kept saying more emotional it was very 
difficult sakamoto said 
before the last emperor i was kind of afraid to let people 
into my music i could hardly communicate with people but after 
the experience of the last emperor i easily could communicate 
with people i was surprised 
so sakamoto calls beauty his most idealistic record a 
former loners attempt to embrace the world to the beat of world 
music the composers own mixture of dance rhythms and japanese 
folk 
each day i would say i need an african percussion player i 
need an african guitarist i need a korean guitar player i need a 
chinese musician i had so many different nusicians from all over 
the world and communication was so important for recording with 
them maybe three years ago i couldnt do that 
sakamoto has also worked with rock n rollers he appeared in 
the 1983 film merry christmas mr lawrence which starred 
david bowie and two years later collaborated with thomas dolby on 
the album field work 
on beauty he applies his personal touch to the rolling 
stones we love you the original was released in 1967 right 
after mick jagger and keith richards had been jailed briefly on 
drug charges with john lennon and paul mccartney singing backup 
the song was a cynical take on the summer of love complete with 
the sound of cell doors slamming 
but we love you was no joke to sakamoto who in 1967 was 
politically active and listening to the experimental music of john 
cage the composer got rid of the studio effects and turned the 
song into a friendly handshake offered of course via 
stateoftheart technology 
i wanted to have a song which was for people who i have never 
met he said i wanted to introduce myself to people who were 
not just music fans but all young people like ordinary people in 
the united states people in romania i want them to listen to my 
music

a lyric sheet is not included with galaxie 500s 
album on fire bandleader dean wareham wants it that way 
i dont like writing down lyrics that much said the 
guitaristsingersongwriter a native of new zealand on paper i 
think lyrics are something completely different all they are are 
words that go along with the music 
so listen carefully if you want to sing along though wareham 
doesnt think its worth the trouble hes not telling stories or 
sending messages words about weather cars and the environment are 
only words he says nothing literally worth writing about 
its not like folk music it just helps us set the mood blue 
thunder is about my car not about the weather snowstorm is 
about the weather but just as much about tv people say im into 
nature because of decomposing trees and leave the planet and 
thats not true too many bugs 
the real story can be heard from warehams own brand of white 
noise a guitar that churns out chords as easy as abc and a 
wobbly tenor that breaks occasionally into an even wobblier 
falsetto start simple and build is the motto these songs 
quiet but never peaceful usually open with wareham strumming 
guitar and gradually intensify threatening to explode at any time 
i think we do have a distinctive sound thats a criticism 
everything sounds the same it just means you have a sound you can 
call your own you can hear the influences 
we had some german kids coming to us in frankfurt and they 
said how did you get this sound and then after we played they 
said we couldnt believe how easy it was it was distortion and 
sustained compression 
the members of galaxie 500 met in high school in new york but 
only started playing together 2 years ago bassist naomi yang and 
drummer damon krukowski were in boston and wareham was still in new 
york when he quit his old band 
i quit after the first time on stage when i saw what they were 
like he was a cross between freddie mercury and david lee roth he 
was dancing all over the stage and the stuff he was doing was 
really corny and annoying i had loaned somebody in the band 300 
and when he paid me back i quit 
he needed that money few people including galaxie 500 own a 
copy of the groups first album aurora records released it but 
aurora records consisted of one man operating from his home in 
boston 
he did our single and he did our lp and he did another single 
wareham said whats frustrating for us at this point is when the 
first album gets reviewed in the village voice and you couldnt get 
it in new york 
though their first record was called today the band proudly 
takes its name and music from the past galaxie 500 is a 1960s car 
that a friend of warehams owned and the sound is vintage 1967 
part psychedelic beatles part velvet underground 
on fire was distributed by rough trade records and features 
nine originals plus a cover of isnt it a pity off george 
harrisons all things must pass album harrison and bob dylan 
wrote it and eric clapton played lead guitar but wareham was 
unimpressed applying the faithful start simple and build 
treatment 
my roommate had the record wareham said im not really a 
fan of eric clapton whos all over that record it was a longshot 
in the studio we said lets just give this a try 
galaxie 500 is still a cult band even for galaxie 500 wareham 
puts in time as a temp around manhattan yang has been studying 
architecture and krukowski teaches for now wareham says their 
only goal is to sell enough records to make music a fulltime job 
yeah wed like to do that but i dont think any of us see 
doing it in 10 years we just sort of stumbled into it we just 
played for fun and all of a sudden sounded a little better than it 
did before 
i think our audience really has just got a sense of us things 
have changed a lot it used to that 50 people came to see us in 
boston and now were selling out shows its no longer just critics 
and hipsters

not hearing enough about the federal 
government roger kranz hopes so and hes prepared to fill the gap 
with gossip news and opinion pieces about the capitals major 
industry 
kranz is launching the washington reporter a new daily 
newspaper to remedy what he sees as a dearth of details about 
government and politics it will be distributed free to 30000 
lawyers lobbyists journalists consultants members of congress 
and senior government officials 
they must read many many publications to really find out 
whats going on in washington said kranz who quit his job as 
group vice president of the national journal to publish the new 
paper 
he plans to deliver the inside skinny starting oct 1 in one 
16page package easily digested after his readers finish with the 
washington post the new york times the wall street journal or 
whatever else they read 
kranz said the washington reporter will have more details than 
those papers on what happens daytoday inside the beltway and 
will be more timely than weekly magazines that might carry similar 
stories or think pieces 
i wont have to wait a week to tell you what you already 
know he said its a cliche to say information is power but 
in washington dc having information before anybody else makes 
you powerful 
are the towns movers and shakers ready to add yet another 
publication to their daily diet 
its too much says jim glassman editor of roll call a 
twiceweekly newspaper about congress people are overwhelmed 
with paper and this if it ever gets published is going to 
overwhelm them even more we brought up the idea of going 
daily with our readers and were told god no ive got enough 
stuff on my desk 
on the other hand there can never be enough news for some 
people 
i feel like im getting too much but at the same time i dont 
mind getting more says michael kinsley a syndicated columnist 
and senior editor of the new republic 
there is some skepticism not only about the need for the paper 
but also about whether kranz can raise the 1245 million he says 
he needs for the papers first year i am continuing to negotiate 
for full financing i am on schedule to be publishing in october 
kranz said he refused to name investors or say how much money is 
committed so far 
a prototype of the new paper shows a good grasp of what appeals 
to statusconscious washingtonians including a politics page 
several gossip columns and a page 2 people index of everyone 
mentioned in the entire paper 
i guarantee you it will be the bestread section of the 
newspaper its a very egotistical town kranz said of the 
index in the prototype it includes such insidethebeltway 
luminaries as gop consultant roger ailes and hairdresser robin weir 
as well as the usual lawmakers media types and public officials 
the front page of the prototype features articles about the 
federal election commission the department of housing and urban 
development a sensitive hightech telephone deal with the soviet 
union the house since jim wrights departure a sex survey and 
president bushs capital gains tax cut proposal 
the back pages contain people media and gossip columns stories 
about the television networks a profile of a senate staff aide an 
excerpt from former cbs reporter fred grahams book and an article 
on where the powerful like to lunch five writers offer their views 
on the peace dividend in a twopage commentary section 
don graham publisher of the post said the success of 
newsletters covering narrow slices of federal activity bodes 
reasonably well for the washington reporter 
there are many many daily newspapers covering aspects of the 
work of the federal government but if you look at evidence of the 
last few years there seems to be room for more graham said 
there are continually many new publications starting up some of 
which are quite successful 
one example of that trend is roll call according to glassman 
the chatty tabloidsize paper was an eightpage weekly with a 
circulation of 4000 when he and a partner bought it four years 
ago now he said it comes out twice a week with 30 pages in each 
issue and has a circulation of more than 17000 
we certainly have shown that advertisers are interested in 
reaching the public policy market and there certainly are readers 
there he said but he added a word of advice to kranz its 
got to be real real good

we tend to think of the lowly home video camera 
as a goofdispenser for americas funniest home videos but it 
increasingly is used to record serious things too such as history 
thats graphically illustrated tonight in ted koppels abc news 
special death of a dictator about the bloody december revolt 
in romania that led to the christmas day executions of dictator 
nicolae ceausescu and his wife elena 
while ambiguous in spots its firstrate in the way it 
chronicles the revolution by weaving together oftenchilling 
footage shot by western tv crews and by unidentified romanians 
armed only with home video cameras 
the latter footage is grainy often shot at odd angles but its 
riveting stuff even an early almost farcical headquarters scene 
in which the romanian armys chief of staff is frustrated by 
language problems when the battle still is in doubt 
the same footage shows the head of the hated securitate secret 
police who incredibly is allowed to join the new 
regimeinprogress its officials belatedly suspect him of helping 
their foes and arrest him 
the headquarters farce constrasts sharply with shots of deadly 
combat at the bucharest airport between army troops and the secret 
police where there are visible sparks as bullets strike concrete 
and metal 
some interviews are remarkable particuarly one with an army 
major mihai lupoi an eyewitness to the execution of the 
ceausescus shortly after a quick military trial that was only a 
formality 
the couple captured on dec 22 while trying to flee their 
country were found guilty of genocide and other grave crimes 
we took them out took them to the wall and asked to the 
people who wants to shoot says lupoi who occasionally gives 
a short eerie chuckle as he speaks in english everybody wanted 
to shoot 
so they selected three people and they didnt wait for the 
command to shoot three guns 90 bullets i dont know if all of 
them were in the body nobody counted 
koppel reports that while still alive ceausescu wore a tiny 
radio transmitter he hoped would aid his escape after capture but 
the show leaves unanswered some questions about his attempted 
getaway 
one is why the helicopter pilot who flew the ceausescus from 
bucharest helped in their capture by setting down in a field not 
far from the city details of the capture also were missing from a 
review copy of the program although an abc spokeswoman said that 
will be added tonight 
despite its title death of a dictator actually is a 
twopart report the first is a stepbystep account of the 
romanian revolt that was sparked by reports of a december massacre 
in the border town of timisoara 
the second examines those reports and how many people actually 
died in romania duuring the revolt the dictators long stay in 
power and washingtons apparent willingness to ignore his tyranny 
and whether the revolution really has changed anything in romania 
whether one dictatorship eventually will be replaced with another 
the shows broad scope seems too much for an hour despite the 
skill of koppel and his staff it would have been better to make 
the report a 90minute special or even two separate programs 
but its worth watching if only for its examples of television 
as a force in modern history including the dramatic moment 
ceausescu starts to speak to what he thinks is the usual tame 
crowd you wont forget the startled look on his stern face when 
hes greeted with unexpected jeers and whistling 
although perhaps forgetting tvs coverage of last years bloody 
unsuccessful uprising in beijing romanian tv anchorman nicolae 
melinescu is right in speaking of televisions impact on his 
country last december 
interviewed in english for abcs special his grammar is tangled 
but his meaning is clear when he says i think it was the first 
time when one can watch on tv a revolution live 
 
elsewhere in television 
art for the sake of cable king world productions which 
syndicates such uplifting fare as wheel of fortune has teamed 
with cable tvs arts amp entertainment network on a new friday night 
series on the various arts including theater dance literature 
and even television 
to premiere on may 4 the new venture is called arts amp 
entertainment revue av westin for many years an abc news 
executive is in charge of the show if the series needs some 
traveling music no problem the series senior producer susan

tappi stations waiting room is 
huge but no one starts a trip there it provides a way out if 
something goes wrong under the tsugaru straits in the worlds 
longest tunnel 
five trains stop at tappi each day and let hundreds of people 
off for a look by guided tour at conditions 450 feet beneath the 
surface the passengers then board the next train to finish the 
journey between hokkaido japans northernmost main island and the 
central island of honshu 
the purpose of tappi and yoshioka a similar station near the 
other end of the seikan tunnel is to provide shelter or an exit in 
case of earthquakes or other trouble 
at 50 mph a train takes 40 minutes to complete the trip through 
the tunnel an 85 billion tube 34 miles long that runs under the 
tsugaru straits for nearly 15 miles 
down that way you can walk to the other side a guide said 
pointing down a side tunnel it would take about six hours 
before the seikan opened in march 1988 rail passengers 
tranferred to a ferry for a fourhour voyage across the straits 
between aomori on honshu and hakodate on hokkaido 
sometimes the service was halted by storms a typhoon sank a 
ferry in 1954 killing more than 1100 people and support for a 
tunnel grew 
guides from japan railways show visitors to tappi and yoshioka 
some of the ways of coping with emergencies 
each station is under land the tunnel does not emerge from the 
ground for 8 miles beyond tappi and 10 past yoshioka but 
stranded passengers can take a cable car or stairway to the 
surface it is 1316 steps to the top from tappi about a 20minute 
climb 
both stations are in the service tunnels which are big enough 
for a truck to drive through and run along both sides of the 
36footwide main railway tube 
air pressure in the service tunnels is higher than in the main 
tunnel so smoke from a fire cannot enter them the main tunnel has 
sprinkler and drainage systems 
tappi and yoshioka have rest rooms first aid stations and 
benches for hundreds of people 
sensors and television cameras monitor conditions inside the 
tunnel a television monitor in tappi using remotecontrolled 
cameras gives a sweeping view of conditions on the surface similar 
to that of a submarine periscope 
when there is no emergency passengers can stop at tappi to walk 
in the service tunnels buy soft drinks from a machine or purchase 
a small souvenir tunnel passport whose price of 1000 yen 
670 includes a card good for that value in travel on japan 
railways 
at its center the tunnel is 785 feet below the waters surface 
and 330 feet under the seabed to keep water from seeping in under 
high pressure the earth around the tunnel has been reinforced for 
a distance of up to 65 feet 
excavation began in 1971 with the cost estimated at about 
onethird the final total 
the tunnel required 138 million mandays of work and took the 
lives of 34 workers four serious cases of flooding delayed 
construction 
techniques developed in the project are expected to help in 
construction of the 31mile tunnel under the english channel that 
will link england and france 
seikan completes the ground linkage of japans four main 
islands the 23mile kanmon tunnel betwen honshu and the southern 
island of kyushu was completed in 1942 and in april 1988 the 
77mile seto ohashi bridge opened between honshu and shikoku east 
of kyushu

eight entreprenuers with a handmade 
transmitter satellite dish and broomcloset studio have broken the 
government monopoly on television broadcasts in what used to be the 
soviet bloc 
marek mlynarczyk smiled and said you might say weve made a 
little mess he is general manager of echotv the first private 
commercial television station in eastern europe 
echo has broadcast six hours a night since feb 6 mostly music 
videos and movies pirated more or less from satellite 
transmissions 
nobody believed we would do it said mlynarczyk who thinks 
thats the only reason he and his seven coowners got permission 
from the authorities 
they decided oh if you want permission just take it we 
dont believe you will do something with it he said the 
result is that now no other permissions are being given 
in decades of communist control polands two governmentrun 
television channels offered a dull diet of propaganda presented as 
news cheaptomake interview programs and cheaptobuy american 
reruns and brazilian soap operas occasionally a polish film 
spiced up the schedule 
poles are hooked on the tube nonetheless and mlynarczyk said 
the response to echotv was something of a shock at first 
there is no ratings system in poland but estimates put the 
number of viewers at 200000 for the station which can be picked 
up within about 18 miles of wroclaw an industrial city 200 miles 
southwest of warsaw 
some viewers need a special antenna demand was so great that 
stores sold out and the echotv office was mobbed when an 
advertising misprint implied the antennas were being sold there 
most people can receive echo without special equipment or set 
adjustments 
the station goes on the air at 6 pm from two tiny rooms atop a 
student dormitory where says one of the 16 staff technicians we 
could use a window 
virtually all the equipment fits on a table in one corner three 
televisions two video cassette recorders a personal computer and 
a special effects mixer 
another corner three steps away serves as the set for the 
fiveminute news program the footsquare logo backdrop is cut from 
paper 
andrzej zygmunt the technical manager cobbled together a 
transmitter slightly bigger than a bread box a cable strung 
through an air vent takes the signal to the roof 
the eight shareholders invested the equivalent of about 50000 
in what they call semiprofessional equipment to start the 
station and an affiliated video company 
so far they have more orders for oneminute computergenerated 
advertising messages than they can accommodate the rate is 5 per 
commercial 
were not dreaming of big money mlynarczyk said we just 
want to show we can maintain this 
this is the beginning we are making something new 
there are many plans afoot for original programming but for now 
most of the programs come from mtv the us music video channel 
and other stations carried by satellite 
mlynarczyk said he had a verbal agreement with the satellite 
distributor but was uncomfortable with the informal arrangement 
were the first he said we have to be careful or someone 
could come here and close us down 
he said echos owners want to offer television that is more 
fun mlynarczyk described polish television as too serious 
a lot of guys sitting in arm chairs telling something blah blah 
blah 
marek hamera the program coordinator said it should be 
closer to life everything stateowned tv doesnt do 
after the solidarityled government assumed power last fall 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was under intense public pressure 
to reform state television which one member of parliament called 
the medium that lied the most 
the evening news program was changed and some announcers most 
closely identified with the former communist regime were replaced 
there was criticism when the new director of the state broadcasting 
committee heeded mazowieckis recommendation against a wholesale 
purge 
onethird of the directors have been replaced and a law on 
control of the airwaves is being drafted 
echotvs owners said they applied for the station two weeks 
after the new head of the state committee was appointed 
when we got the permission we worked nonstop to put the 
station on the air because we were afraid someone would take it 
away zygmunt said a permit for a second station in lublin 
southeast of warsaw is on hold 
efforts to break the government monopoly on nonsatellite 
television also are under way elsewhere in eastern europe 
especially in hungary 
mti the hungarian news agency reported that 80 applications 
for private broadcast stations had been filed but the hungarian 
government has said there should be only three televison channels 
the state already controls two

unsecured creditors of eastern airlines 
exasperated at the carriers mounting losses and its new plan to 
reduce debt payments are considering seeking the liquidation of

unsecured creditors of eastern airlines 
exasperated at the carriers mounting losses and its new plan to 
reduce debt payments are considering seeking the liquidation of 
the airline sources said 
a source close to the creditors committee said thursday there 
is a 5050 chance the group will request the bankruptcy court 
to appoint a special trustee to oversee a liquidation of eastern 
such a move would be a radical shift by the creditors they have 
been supportive of eastern since it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization on march 9 1989 five days after it was struck by 
machinists pilots and flight attendants 
the naming of a trustee who would take control of the airline 
from frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
has long been advocated by the airlines unions but rejected by 
both the company and its creditors 
a move for liquidation also could imperil easterns agreement to 
sell its prized latin american routes to american airlines for 349 
million proceeds from that sale are central to easterns plan to 
rebuild 
on tuesday miamibased eastern sharply scaled back its business 
prospects forecasting a bigger loss for this year and a delay in 
this summers planned emergence from bankruptcy reorganization 
eastern said difficulties in rebuilding its strikebattered 
business also meant it would be unable to fulfill a tentative 
agreement to pay unsecured creditors 50 cents on the dollar under 
that accord the unsecured creditors who are owed 980 million 
would receive about 490 million in cash and notes 
the creditors committee privately passed a resolution late 
tuesday authorizing its attorneys to seek the appointment of a 
trustee and to propose a plan of liquidation said sources close to 
the committee who requested anonymity 
the creditors attorneys would take such action if texas air 
refused to cover easterns future operating losses according to 
the resolution 
currently the losses are funded out of escrow accounts held for 
the creditors which contain the proceeds of sales of eastern 
assets 
in the event texas air refuses to fund such losses the 
committee hereby authorizes counsel to prepare and file either a 
motion seeking the appointment of a trustee to consummate the sale 
to american airlines and then to effectuate an orderly liquidation 
of eastern airlines or a liquidating plan and a contemporaneous 
motion for the appointment of a trustee the resolution read 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland on thursday approved 
easterns proposed sale of the latin american routes and related 
assets 
that sale forms the core of a 471 million deal that also 
includes a 1025 million settlement of litigation between american 
and continental airlines easterns sister texas air subsidiary 
the proposed transaction still must be approved by the 
transportation department a department attorney said at the 
hearing in us bankruptcy court that a decision on the sale 
probably would be made by april 6 
if approved the transfer would cap a string of more than 800 
million in assets sold by eastern 
the sale also would greatly extend the international reach of 
american the nations largest airline 
completion of the sale is a necessary condition for final 
approval of a reorganization agreement between eastern and the 
unsecured creditors which include aircraft and engine 
manufacturers such as boeing co airbus industrie and general 
electric co 
one source close to the situation said robert ferguson a vice 
president of texas air suggested to creditors during a conference 
call thursday that they pretend to negotiate a reorganization 
of eastern until the transportation department approves the sale 
houstonbased texas air was concerned that if the department 
thought eastern was being liquidated it would bar the sale this 
source said 
the airlines suggestion is designed to pull the wool over the 
eyes of the department of transportation the source said 
thats at the very least unethical if not unlawful 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami declined any comment on 
the issue 
eastern and texas air will discuss with the responsible 
parties the manner in which to structure a final agreement he 
said 
lawyers for the air line pilots association and the machinists 
union opposed the latin american sale at the hearing as they have 
done with easterns previous asset transfers 
adam harris an attorney representing easterns unsecured 
creditors said they didnt object to the transaction the 
committee did not express in court its displeasure with easterns 
latest reorganization proposals 
early this month the justice department said it did not object 
to the sale of the latin american routes 
eastern bought the latin american routes from braniff inc in 
1982 for around 30 million

shocker national enquirer publisher poised to 
devour star 
thats how the star might scream it from its rack near the 
checkout counter 
under an agreement announced thursday rupert murdochs news 
corp ltd is selling the star for at least 400 million in cash and 
stock to the company that publishes its tabloid rival 
the news came as a surprise to star staffers 
were in shock said barry levine the stars hollywood 
bureau chief up until this moment we and the enquirer have been 
bitter enemies 
but the wouldbe buyer gp group inc of lantana fla said 
it plans to maintain the stars editorial independence and 
would continue to publish it from the magazines current location 
in tarrytown ny 
they will still compete with each other said iain calder 
editor and president of the enquirer from his office in florida 
the agreement comes nearly a year after gp group itself was 
acquired by a partnership led by principals of the romance magazine 
publisher macfadden holdings inc and the media investment firm 
boston ventures for 4125 million macfaddens titles include true 
story true confessions and modern romance 
the purchase would solidify gp groups franchise in the 
grocery checkout lines it also publishes the sensationalist weekly 
world news 
the star has an average weekly circulation of 36 million 
according to news corp the national enquirers average weekly 
circulation is 41 million and weekly world news is at 950000 
according to gp group 
under terms of the proposed sale news corp would receive about 
200 million in cash and the balance in preferred stock in gp 
group 
the sale is expected to be completed before june 30 the 
companies said in a news release it is subject to government 
waivers or approvals and other conditions 
news corp was expected to use proceeds from the sale to reduce 
debt incurred in several recent acquisitions including the 3 
billion purchase of the publisher of tv guide in 1988 and the 407 
million purchase of book publisher scott foresman and co last fall 
star was among the first major successes for murdoch in the 
united states 
we created star magazine 16 years ago and developed it into 
one of americas most popular periodicals said martin singerman 
president of news america publishing inc the news corp 
subsidiary that publishes the magazine 
michael boylan vice chairman and chief operating officer said 
gp group was interested because the star is a great 
publication and newsstand distribution is a business we 
understand 
since taking over the enquirer and the weekly world news gp 
groups new owners reportedly have more than tripled the companys 
annual cash flow to about 60 million partly by trimming a 
400person staff by about 10 percent and partly by making paper and 
printing operations more efficient 
some of the biggest names in the publishing business were 
believed to have been bidders for gp group when it was up for 
sale last year including britains maxwell communications corp 
frances hachette sa and the west german publisher heinrich bauer 
it could not be determined if there were any other bidders for 
the star news corp officials were said to be unavailable for 
comment 
australianbased news corp is a diversified international media 
company with interests in newspapers magazines book publishing 
motion picture and television production and commercial printing 
in addition to its debt from acquisitions the company has been 
preparing to expand its weekly lineup of shows for its fox 
television network which is mounting a challenge to the abc nbc 
and cbs networks

theater goers get the cast names in a playbook 
sports fans can look up the players numbers in a program and now 
diners at more than 60 new york restaurants are getting their menu 
in a magazine 
the magazine is called knife amp fork and it is being produced by 
a joint venture involving a specialty publishing concern and a 
company that owns restaurants 
instead of the usual menus customers at selected restaurants 
are getting the general interest magazine with its menu stapled 
inside they can read while they eat or take it home 
it is being billed as just the ticket for advertisers trying to 
reach young gogetters who often dont spend much time watching tv 
if it is successful in new york its owners say they may expand it 
nationally 
but critics said the magazine could be an unwelcome conversation 
stopper and some advertising executives said they failed to detect 
a clear sense of editorial mission something they say is critical 
to a magazines success 
knife amp fork is the latest in a growing trend which has seen the 
creation of media vehicles aimed at helping advertisers reach 
specific audiences more efficiently than through mass magazines or 
broadcast outlets 
some recent examples include advertisersupported magazines for 
women at the beauty parlor or the doctors office 
critics say people may grow weary of finding themselves targeted 
for advertising in unexpected locations they question whether 
these media vehicles are reaching as many people as projected 
knife amp fork is a creation of a 5050 joint venture between the 
publishing company performance network inc of lindenhurst ny 
and the riese organization a privatelyheld company that owns more 
than 300 restaurants in the new york area and owns stakes in more 
than 100 others nationwide 
performance network previously has published boxing programs for 
madison square garden events and sells advertising in the sports 
programs distributed at new york mets baseball games according to 
chairman richard neste 
neste and murray riese a partner in the riese organization 
each declined to say how much they were investing in the new 
magazine project 
the marchapril issue is being distributed at about 65 to 70 
rieseowned restaurants in manhattan the restaurants are known by 
22 different brand names including houlihans charlie os tgi 
fridays and lindys 
not counting the menu the magazine was 32 pages and included a 
feature on personal ads a story on what your underwear says about 
you and tips on how to buy a mans suit some articles were 
reprints from other magazines 
advertisers were told more than 1 million copies of the magazine 
will be distributed every two months based on customer counts at 
the restaurants 
among the brands advertised in the first issue were parliament 
lights cigarettes miller beer v8 vegetable juice and sony 
televisions 
advertising executives compared the magazine to theater 
playbills which have a few pages devoted to the specific 
production surrounded by stories on theater in general 
neste who is publisher and editor in chief said knife amp fork 
is different because customers have to look at it to order 
but will people go back to the magazine later 
the key issue is how many of them will look at it said 
joseph ostrow worldwide media director for foote cone amp belding 
communications he said he expects the magazine will provide 
research to address that

dallas billionaire harold simmons may 
have lost his proxy war for control of lockheed corps board but 
he claimed all the credit for the companys sudden fondness for its 
major shareholders 
at lockheeds annual meeting thursday chairman daniel tellep 
made major concessions to the pension funds and other large 
investors who hold 60 percent of its stock the biggest was an 
offer to give shareholders up to three new seats on the board 
simmons who controls 19 percent of the military contractors 
common stock originally asked for six board seats when denied 
the investor nominated his own full slate of candidates and urged 
shareholders to vote for them 
official results of the vote for the board and for several 
shareholder rights planks wont be know until next week at the 
earliest but tellep claimed victory 
im expecting a clear majority in every category of 
shareholder except of course mr simmons tellep said at a news 
conference after the meeting 
at a separate news conference simmons and martin at first said 
the contest was too close to call but later they seemed to 
acknowledge defeat 
its like a political campaign martin said sometimes you 
just have to come back again the next time 
tellep who took the helm of lockheed last year said he courted 
70 institutional investors during the past few weeks of the proxy 
battle he said he considered the wooing of shareholders a valuable 
education and his baptism by fire in their desire to have a say 
in the companys affairs 
replied simmons theres no question but it was our campaign 
that caused him to get religion 
added simmons chief lieutenant j landis martin mr simmons 
was baptized a long time ago 
the battle waged in newspaper advertisements as well as formal 
mailings to shareholders was expensive lockheed spent about 8 
million and simmons spent about 6 million 
asked about his efforts to portray himself as a builder of 
companies rather than a corporate raider simmons said we 
werent entirely successful no he complained that he had not 
had enough time to wage his campaign because tellep had moved up 
the date of the meeting 
tellep acknowledged thursday that he turned down a lastminute 
compromise proposal in which simmons promised to drop his campaign 
to replace the board in return for three board seats 
simmons began his campaign as a battle for the entire board and 
that is the way lockheed fought it tellep said 
he also said simmons never personally presented a formal 
settlement offer instead the offer was forwarded tuesday by 
thomas flanigan the chief investment officer of the california 
teachers pension fund which wound up supporting simmons 
the annual meeting was held in a vast hangar beside the burbank 
airport not far from where lockheed built the stealth fighter in 
the supersecret skunk works 
in addition to up to three new board seats tellep promised to 
heed the results of a shareholder rights proposal urging the 
company to opt out of strict antitakeover provisions of the law in 
delaware where lockheed is incorporated 
tellep said even if the proposal got only a significant 
minority vote he would recommend that the board support an 
amendment at the next meeting to have lockheed opt out 
he also offered to meet regularly with representatives of 
simmons nl industries inc to discuss the future of lockheed 
and he reiterated a promise made earlier to recommend to the 
board that shareholders be allowed to vote confidentially from now 
on 
martin and simmons objected to the way in which a small portion 
of the shares belonging to an employees stock ownership plan had 
been voted they said the trustee of the plan which holds 19 
percent of lockheed stock had wrongly voted all the shares even 
though some employees abstained from voting 
those shares were voted proportionally with the rest of the 
plans votes which went by more than 90 percent to lockheeds 
board martin suggested that if his side lost by a narrow margin 
it might challenge the result on those grounds 
tellep said he would look into whether the employees could get 
one of the new board seats but stopped short of promising they 
would 
simmons had urged lockheed with a recent history of sagging 
earnings and cost overruns to improve profits at its noncore 
technology services and electronics businesses or sell them off 
the company said simmons had no experience in military 
contracting and no business running lockheed which had 1989 sales 
of 99 billion tellep also claimed the company was poised for a 
rebound after a major restructuring last year and a decision to 
take 500 million in writeoffs 
simmons has lost 100 million on his 530 million investment in 
lockheed because of a slumping share price lockheed stock fell 25 
cents thursday to 3662 on the new york stock exchange

the federal reserve board believes regulation 
of stocks and stock index futures by two separate government 
agencies has not worsened price swings in the stock markets 
chairman alan greenspan says 
greenspan told a senate panel thursday that while some fine 
tuning is in order the fed doesnt think creating one super 
regulator is the answer to jurisdictional disputes 
the board does not believe that the existing division of 
regulatory authority has increased volatility in the securities 
markets he said 
the head of the nations top economic policymaking body was 
among several key government officials to testify on the turf 
battle between the securities and exchange commission and the 
commodity futures trading commission 
greenspan told the securities subcommittee of the senate 
banking housing and urban affairs committee that he marginally 
favored giving jurisdiction over stock index futures to the sec 
but he quickly said he was speaking only for himself on that 
point and that several fed governors disagreed with that position 
the commodity futures trading commission oversees stock index 
futures which let investors bet on the rise and fall of a basket 
of stocks without having to buy the underlying securities 
but critics claim the wide disparity between margins the 
downpayment investors must make to buy securities on credit 
required in futures markets and the securities markets leads to 
sharp rises and drops in prices and that volatility they say has 
spooked small investors out of the stock market 
the federal reserve sets margin requirements for stocks and 
other securities but margins for futures contracts are set by the 
exchanges themselves usually at a fraction of the amount the fed 
requires 
greenspan said the fed does not see a clear basis for choosing 
between cftc and sec oversight of stock index futures margins 
he added however that the board feels strongly about 
giving up the margin authority it has already and putting the sec 
and the exchanges in charge of setting margins for stocks and stock 
options 
other witnesses included sec chairman richard c breeden cftc 
chairman wendy l gramm and treasury undersecretary robert r 
glauber 
while those three agencies have delivered opinions on who should 
regulate socalled hybrid financial products that contain 
aspects of both a security and a futures contract greenspan 
previously had kept mum 
last year a federal appeals court in chicago ruled that 
financial products with any properties of a futures contract belong 
under cftc oversight 
the fed treasury sec and cftc make up the presidents working 
group on financial markets a panel set up in the wake of the 1987 
stock market crash they have yet to reach an agreement on the 
thorny matter of jurisdiction for hybrid instruments like stock 
index futures 
breeden said he favored either merging control of securities and 
futures under one agency or at the least giving the sec control 
over stock index futures as well as stocks glauber said treasury 
favors giving the sec authority over stocks stock options and 
stock index futures 
gramm however opposes any shift in cftc jurisdiction 
claiming it hasnt been proven that such a change would benefit the 
markets 
the subcommittee chaired by sen christopher dodd dconn is 
looking specifically at the question of margins 
this hearing is not to debate the issue of turf dodd said 
at the hearings start but the topic quickly strayed to the 
longsimmering dispute between the sec and the cftc 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said the jurisdictional debate was holding up 
muchneeded reform in the commodities futures markets 
in testimony before dodds subcommittee he accused the sec of 
launching a hostile takeover of the cftcs responsibilities 
i am convinced that simply shifting jurisdiction for stock 
index futures from the cftc to the sec will not strengthen 
regulation end volatility in the stock market or restore investor 
confidence in wall street 
he called for passage of legislation to make the cftc a tougher 
regulator and then someday combine the cftc and sec 
but realistically the merger solution is far off said 
leahy

a chicago bank renowned for revitalizing its 
impoverished neighborhood is hoping to find a market for a novel 
instrument certificates of deposit for socially conscious 
investors 
for investors willing to forsake big yields the new cds from 
the south shore bank of chicago promise to give a boost to the 
citys south shore neighborhood and provide aid for groups such as 
vietnamese refugees bank officials said thursday 
i think its going to appeal to that universe of social 
investors who want to do something good with their money said 
katherine gross director of the revolving loan fund of the 
industrial cooperative association of somerville mass the banks 
partner in the effort 
a normal certificate of deposit might pay a 7 percent return 
but investors who buy a south shore cd can choose to keep 1 percent 
to 4 percent of the interest and give the rest to the ica 
a 100000 cd yielding 7 percent annually would return 7000 to 
an investor but if the south shore investor chose to earn only 1 
percent interest or 1000 the other 6000 in interest would be 
donated to the ica 
the nonprofit group invests such funds in locallyowned 
companies and community organizations around the country gross 
said prospective clients include an indian tribe in north dakota 
that wants to start a gas station and a group of vietnamese 
refugees who want to start a fishing cooperative she said 
the new cd serves a twofold purpose the interest goes to the 
nonprofit group while the principal is reinvested in the south 
shore neighborhood 
for someone who would like to promote social objectives this 
is a terrific investment said jan piercy vice president of 
shore bank corp the groups holding company but anyone who is 
interested in profit maximization is not going to be interested in 
this 
the bank has earned a national reputation for its efforts to 
revitalize the neighborhood 
like many other urban areas south shore suffered from the white 
flight to the suburbs the neighborhood went from nearly allwhite 
in the 1950s to 98 percent black by the early 1970s many banks and 
businesses fled during that time 
south shores previous owner even asked the federal reserve 
board for permission to move the bank to the loop chicagos 
downtown business district but the community revolted and the fed 
denied permission piercy said 
the owner decided to sell and a group of investors including 
several philanthropic foundations formed the holding company to 
buy the bank for 32 million in 1973 
the new owners decided to use the banks money to help the 
community and targeted socially conscious investors nationwide to 
increase its deposits 
during the last 15 years the bank has provided loans to 
renovate more than 22 percent of the neighborhoods rental units 
all of the funds which south shore gets from its depositors 
are targeted back into the community not into investments in junk 
bonds or oil said alan walker the banks administrator for 
development deposits 
that approach has won praise from some and the bank is the 
subject of a book called community capitalism by a university 
of chicago professor 
because of the banks efforts property values have steadily 
improved and the neighborhood is a better place to live than it 
was 10 or 15 years ago said dr richard taub a social science 
professor and author of the book

kidder peabody group inc is selling its 
portfolio of risky junk bonds and bridge loans to its parents 
credit arm for about 750 million making it the latest wall street 
house to turn to its parent for capital 
analysts said the sale of the apparently illiquid investments to 
ge capital corp would increase kidders capital base and reduce 
its exposure to the dormant highyield bond market 
its going to make our balance sheet very much stronger and 
very much more liquid that it was prior to the deal kidder chief 
operating officer dick odonnell said 
the deal follows closely on the heels of efforts by american 
express co to bolster its ailing brokerage division in recent 
months american express has announced plans to take over shearson 
lehman hutton inc and inject about 135 billion in new capital 
kidder is a wholly owned subsidiary of general electric co 
it looks like were starting to see the beginning of a trend 
here said lawrence eckenfelder an industry analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc it strengthens the balance sheet 
of these companies 
like other wall street firms kidder has been hurt by a downturn 
in the individual investing merger activity and securities 
underwriting the firm is shifting its retail operation to focus on 
wealthy clients and small companies rather than all investors 
kidder also has cut its work force to 5600 employees from a 
peak of 7500 
kidders 750 million portfolio is being sold at current market 
value but officials refused to reveal the face value of the 
investments 
the new york times reported that kidder would post an operating 
loss of less than 25 million for the first quarter to reflect the 
reduced value of the portfolio under the transaction 
about half the package is junk bonds and a third outstanding 
bridge loans credits made by kidder that were intended to be 
temporary but for which the firm failed to raise permanent 
financing the remaining onesixth is in equity investments in 
companies made by kidders merchant banking department 
kidder refused to say when the junk bonds were issued and bridge 
loans were made or to what companies 
it said three bridge loans had a total value of under 250 
million the bonds came from the firms merchant banking division 
and were not part of its daily trading portfolio 
odonnell said the firm was not getting out of the highyield 
bond business and would continue to maintain a trading inventory 
he also said kidder still would provide merchant banking 
services in which an investment firm takes an equity stake in its 
clients 
kidder officials sought to play down the comparison with 
shearson chairman and chief executive michael a carpenter said in 
a statement that ge capital is better positioned to realize the 
future value of the portfolio because it manages longerterm 
loans 
this is not a bailout whatsoever odonnell said they are 
buying 750 million worth of investments for cash this is an 
inventory which will be part of a much larger portfolio they 
manage 
he said the move will increase the net capital of kidders 
brokerdealer unit by about 100 million the value of its 
illiquid junk bond holdings that will push the regulated entitys 
capital to about 250 million above new york stock exchange 
requirements he said 
kidder lost 23 million last year compared with a 46 million 
profit in 1988 
ge the electrical products broadcasting and financial services 
company based in fairchild conn paid 600 million to acquire an 
80 percent stake in kidder in 1986

japans consumer price index climbed a steep 36 
percent in february from a year ago as a snap of cold weather 
pushed up food prices while a weak yen caused a rise in wholesale 
prices the government said friday 
the management and coordination agency said februarys 
yeartoyear gain was the largest since november 1981 when 
consumer prices rose 38 percent 
compared with the previous month consumer prices were up 03 
percent 
higher vegetable prices resulting from heavy snow and cold 
weather were largely responsible for last months increase said an 
agency official speaking on condition of anonymity 
vegetable prices jumped 173 percent in february while prices 
for fresh vegetable prices surged 249 percent the agency said 
fruit prices increased by 147 percent and dairy products rose 
108 percent 
recreation expenses registered a 51 percent increase the 
agency said 
in the tokyo area consumer prices were up 04 percent in march 
from the previous month and were 35 percent higher than a year 
earlier the government said tokyoarea prices are seen as an 
early indicator of price movements for the rest of japan 
for the fiscal year ending saturday consumer prices in the 
tokyoarea were up 32 percent from the previous fiscal year 
separately the bank of japan reported wholesale prices edged up 
02 percent in the second 10 days of march from the previous 10day 
period and were up 38 percent from a year earlier 
the central bank attributed the increase partly to the weak 
japanese yen wholesale prices have been rising gradually in recent 
months as the yens steady decline made imports more expensive 
meanwhile japan posted a 4907 billion current account surplus 
in february down 324 percent from a year ago the finance 
ministry reported 
this marked the 12th consecutive decline in the current account 
surplus from yearearlier levels the ministry said

down 356 percent drop a year ago exports totaled 215 billion 
down 500 million or 22 percent from a year ago while imports 
climbed 26 billion or 189 percent to 161 billion 
separately the government said the seasonally adjusted 
unemployment rate fell to 21 percent in february as the job market 
continued to tighten 
februarys jobless rate down 01 percentage point from 
januarys 22 percent matched the lowest level japan has 
maintained since last june 
japans jobless rate would be higher if calculated by us or 
european methods in japan members of the armed forces and people 
working more than one hour in the last week of the month are 
considered employed

the chairman of australias hooker 
corp which had us retail and development interests before going 
into provisional liquidation last year was ordered friday to stand 
trial on corruption charges 
a magistrate in the northern state of queensland ruled that 
george herscu chairman and former chief executive of hooker 
explain payments allegedly made to russell hinze a former state 
minister in 1983 
it was alleged that herscu paid the money so that hinze would 
intervene in a dispute between the brisbane city council and a 
shopping center development company associated with herscu 
during the preliminary hearing herscu claimed the money was a 
loan to be used by hinze to buy racehorses in new zealand on 
herscus behalf 
but the hearing was told that no horses were ever purchased with 
the money which was repaid to herscu after allegations about the 
payments were made public in 1988 
herscu has not made any plea to the charges the trial is 
expected to start in june 
hooker corp a property development and retail company entered 
provisional liquidation in july 1989 with bank debts of about 1 
billion

the government said friday it would wait five years 
before deciding whether to break up japans major 
telecommunications company whose recent stock slump has been 
linked in part to investor worries about a breakup 
the government still is the major shareholder in nippon 
telegraph and telephone corp which was converted into a private 
company in 1985 
for the time being we are going to promote rationalization of 
the company without breaking it up said minister of posts and 
telecommunications takashi fukaya and if it is deemed necessary 
to break up the company we will take up the matter again in 1995 
and make the final conclusion 
a government advisory council suggested earlier this month that 
ntt should be broken into three separate companies offering local 
longdistance and mobile telephone services 
after two years of study the council concluded that ntts 
virtual monopoly on telephone service has hindered free competition 
in japans telecommunications market and led to inefficient 
management of ntt 
a final government decision had been expected at the end of 
march when the government was required to review the state of the 
telecommunications market under the law that made ntt a private 
company five years ago 
but the finance ministry in charge of offering ntt stock to the 
public has strongly opposed a breakup claiming it will hurt ntt 
shareholders 
hundreds of shareholders have complained to the ministry that 
the price of ntt stock has slumped to about 11 million yen or 
7050 a share from 318 million yen or 20385 in april 1987 
shortly after its listing on the tokyo stock exchange 
company officials have attributed recent declines to a general 
stock market slump as well as worries about a breakup which ntt 
opposes on grounds it would lead to duplication of effort by the 
longdistance and local service companies 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said the governments 
decision to postpone a conclusion on breaking up ntt reflects the 
governments understanding about the concern of shareholders 
hashimoto also hinted that the ban on foreign investors holding 
ntt shares is likely to be removed soon

general motors corp did not violate its contract 
with the united auto workers union by idling the fiero assembly 
plant in pontiac mich an arbitrator ruled 
the ruling by arbitrator thomas roberts of los angeles upheld 
gms contention that the plant which shut down in august 1988 
after a sharp decline in sales of the twoseat sports car is 
indefinitely idled rather than closed about 1700 workers were 
laid off 
were obviously pleased with the arbitrators ruling that gm 
did not violate the terms of the national agreement the company 
said in a statement thursday 
from the outset of this disagreement it was our position that 
these actions were caused by volumerelated market decreases 
and demand for the product and therefore justifiable a gm 
spokesman said 
the ruling could raise tensions between the union and the 
automaker as they prepare for contract negotiations next summer 
the decision provides a clear imperative to improve the job 
security provisions of our contract in the new agreement said 
stephen yokich the uaws vice president in charge of the unions 
gm department 
uaw officials have vowed they would press to close loopholes in 
the existing threeyear contracts plant closing prohibition 
despite the prohibition the automaker has laid off 10 percent 
of its uaw work force since 1987 gm plants in leeds mo and 
framingham mass have been idled and a third facility in 
lakewood ga is to halt production this summer 
gm began building fiero cars at the pontiac plant in 1984 and 
showcased the facility as a model of labormanagement cooperation 
the uaw agreed to set aside a number of longstanding work rules 
that limited management flexibility in running the plant 
but fiero sales plunged in 1987 partly because of defect 
problems and gm ordered a massive recall late in the year to 
correct problems causing engine fires in 1984 models 
when gm announced in 1988 that the plant would close yokichs 
predecessor donald ephlin came under fire from uaw dissidents for 
championing cooperative labormanagement relations yokich replaced 
ephlin as head of the unions 300000member gm department nine 
months ago

despite a top executives contention that a 
4weekold strike is losing its impact greyhound lines inc and 
its bus drivers union say they will return to the negotiating 
table next week 
greyhound broke off talks with the amalgamated council of 
greyhound local unions on march 18 citing continued violence since 
the drivers walked out march 2 
although the company says the violence is continuing daily with 
more than 200 incidents overall it has agreed to resume 
negotiations monday in tucson ariz 
greyhound spokesman steve scarpino said a shot was fired at a 
greyhound bus about two miles east of tulsa okla early today no 
one was hurt he said in oklahoma rogers county sheriffs office 
dispatcher lance beard said officers were investigating the 
shooting on interstate 44 
scarpino said the bus was en route to new york from tulsa with 
26 passengers aboard when what appeared to be pellets struck the 
windshield of the bus the windshield was damaged he said 
the union has condemned the violence and says its officials are 
not involved 
bernard delury head of the federal mediation and conciliation 
service said thursday that two mediators will participate in the 
negotiations 
union spokesman jeff nelson said we assume that if they have 
agreed to go back to the table we hope that they would be 
interested in negotiating 
previous negotiations have ended with the two sides at odds on 
wage and job security issues the company says it can afford no 
more than the 63 million threeyear pact it is offering 
however the union and greyhound differ over the value of the 
unions proposal with greyhound saying the last offer would cost 
180 million and the union putting the value at about 40 million 
greyhound operating with crossovers and permanent replacements 
said thursday it will expand service sunday putting it at 541 
percent of its total prestrike miles the company is adding 112 
round trips that will increase service to some cities and add 50 
destinations 
president frank schmieder said greyhound would like to end the 
open warfare with the union but contended were beginning to 
have plenty of drivers in certain areas yes its over 
essentially through the southeast and southwest i think its 
over schmieder said in an interview wednesday chicago 
minneapolis its over although its still tight in the 
northeast and west he said 
if the company were being as successful as its claimed to be 
i think you would have seen some kind of rush back to work the 
unions nelson said that has not happened and that has not 
happened number one because the company is not up and running 
nelson claimed the company is operating only 20 percent of 
prestrike routes 
while greyhound says it has been increasing the number of routes 
it is serving during the strike schmieder said greyhound has no 
nearterm plans to restore service to about 32 percent of the total 
greyhound system that is unprofitable 
the decision could leave numerous areas without any intercity 
bus transportation but greyhound spokeswoman elizabeth hale said 
thursday the company would attempt to subcontract some of the 
routes 
in no way are we abandoning that 32 percent forever she 
said 
greyhound is the only nationwide bus company serving about 
9500 prestrike destinations in about 9000 of those areas the 
company provides the only intercity transportation

the national association of securities dealers 
has proposed eliminating penny stocks from its overthecounter 
trading system partly in response to a crackdown on fraud in the 
lowcost securities 
the selfregulatory agency said thursday it would seek 
government approval to effectively double the standards companies 
must meet to be listed on the nasdaq stock system 
nasdaq stands for the national association of securities dealers 
automated quotations system a computerized stock price quotation 
system owned and operated by the nasd 
the move is expected to eliminate about 500 lowcost highrisk 
securities known as penny stocks because they usually trade for 
less than a dollar from the nasdaq system about 5000 stocks 
currently trade on nasdaq 
the new standards will not affect about 2700 stocks traded on 
the nasdaq national market which already has a higher standard 
the new standards adopted by the nasds board of governors 
earlier this month would require companies issuing stock for the 
first time to have a minimum of 4 million in total assets and 2 
million in capital and surplus compared to the present 
requirements of 2 million and 1 million 
in addition to the currently required 100000 shares of public 
float for an issue the float would have to have a market value of 
1 million float is the term used to describe the number of public 
shares circulating in the market 
stocks would have to have a minimum bid price of 3 per share 
there is no minimum required now 
maintaining a stock listing on nasdaq under the new rule would 
require a company to have 2 million in assets instead of the 
750000 in effect now also 1 million in capital surplus up 
from 375000 would be required the float would have to have a 
market value of 200000 and the stock would be required to have a 
1 minimum bid price 
the changes if approved by the securities and exchange 
commission would not go into effect until next january to give 
already listed companies time to meet the new rule 
nasd executive vice president john t wall said the changes 
reflected the effects of inflation since the requirements were last 
amended in 1981 
also prompting the changes was a jan 10 letter from the sec 
expressing concern that unscrupulous promoters might seek to 
circumvent tougher rules for selling penny stocks by acquiring a 
listing on nasdaq stock market 
such a listing would exempt them from the sec rule requiring a 
clients written consent to buy stocks not listed by nasdaq or a 
stock exchange

european skin and hair care operations to nobel consumer goods ab 
of sweden for about 107 million 
gillette also will collect an additional 30 million from 
accounts in those businesses the company said 
the brands to be sold include silkience hair care products 
aapri skin care items antica erobristeria herbal toiletries in 
italy and la toja toiletry products in spain

the company had hoped 
gillette spokesman david fausch said the businesses being bought 
by nobel had about 132 million in sales last year that compares 
with gillettes worldwide toiletry sales of about 1 billion 
the proceeds from the sale will offset the costs of the 
realignment fausch said 
gillettes european deodorants antiperspirants and shaving 
creams are not part of the transaction

rejecting 500 million in aid to coal miners who could lose their 
jobs because of tougher environmental standards 
by a 5049 vote thursday senators defeated a proposal that sen 
robert byrd dwva called only a matter of fairness and 
justice because thousands of miners will be thrown out of work 
the majority heeded warnings from senate leaders that the 
amendment would prompt a presidential veto of the overall bill 
the threeyear 500 million assistance program was considered 
to be the last major obstacle to senate passage of the clean air 
bill a vote on the legislation is scheduled for next tuesday a 
house version is in committee 
working into the evening thursday the senate agreed to a 
provision that would require the increased sale of a cleaner blend 
of gasoline by 1993 in cities facing the worst smog problems the 
measure was approved by voice vote after attempts to reject it 
failed 6930 
the nine cities that would fall under the new clean fuels 
requirement are los angeles houston new york city milwaukee 
baltimore philadelphia hartford conn san diego and chicago 
meanwhile the house energy and commerce committee late thursday 
adopted a proposal in its clean air bill that also would require 
the use of a cleaner blend of gasoline by 1995 in the same cities 
although rejecting a plan to broaden the requirement from nine to 
as many as 40 cities 
thursdays vote on the byrd amendment was as dramatic as the 
final tally would indicate 
senators were subject to intense pressure from both sides 
byrd who wields considerable power and respect as a former 
democratic leader and now chairman of the appropriations committee 
had visited dozens of senators to plead for support 
he thought he had enough votes to win as the count began 
although a number of senators had not yet made firm commitments to 
either side sen spark matsunaga dhawaii a staunch byrd ally 
who suffers from cancer arrived for the vote in a wheelchair 
but the pressure was just as intense from the other side the 
white house unleashed a final round of telephone calls to key 
senators including some calls as the vote already was under way 
the senate leaders of both parties george mitchell dmaine 
and bob dole rkan used every means of persuasion to line their 
senators up against the amendment and the white house passed the 
word that president bush would veto the bill if it contained the 
miner aid provision 
i know how hard it is to say no to the president of the united 
states byrd said later three of my votes took wings he 
lamented alluding to three senators who changed votes in the final 
minutes 
the administration had strongly opposed the coal miner aid 
package arguing that it was too expensive and singled out one 
industry while workers in other fields also might lose their jobs 
but not have special benefits 
senate leaders also had feared that if the measure were approved 
other senators would seek similar financial aid for workers in 
other industries sen phil gramm rtexas promised to do just 
that 
mitchell said thousands of workers in other industries 
including steel and petrochemicals also could suffer job losses 
and would not have such benefits 
but byrd urged colleagues to hear the cries of people and 
maintained that helping the miners was no different that the 
federal assistance given to victims of a hurricane or earthquake 
who suffer because of no fault of their own 
were not asking for welfare he declared 
the government estimates as many as 5000 miners of highsulfur 
coal primarily in appalachia and parts of the midwest will lose 
their jobs because of new controls on sulfur dioxide emissions 
required by midwest electric power plants 
the utilities are likely to shift from using highsulfur coal to 
a cleaner fuel such as lowsulfur western coal or natural gas 
causing some eastern mines to close 
under byrds proposal miners of highsulfur coal who lose 
their jobs because utilities switched fuels would have received up 
to 70 percent of their salaries for three years and additional 
funds if they participated in a retraining program 
the benefits would have been available as long as the miner was 
unemployed during the three years

the senate banking committee today narrowly 
endorsed president bushs nominee for top savings and loan 
regulator 
the panel voted 1110 to recommend t timothy ryan jr to be 
director of the treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
the matter now goes to the full senate 
two democrats joined all nine republicans on the panel in 
backing ryan the vote came after democrats spent 90 minutes 
complaining that ryan a former senior labor department official 
lacked experience for the job 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich said ryans qualifications 
were woefully short of the quality necessary to do this job 
riegle had said earlier that the panel probably would vote against 
ryans nomination 
republicans argued that someone with more experience in the 
savings and loan industry probably would be disqualified by virtue 
of conflicts of interest they argued that rejecting ryan would 
only serve to derail bushs savings and loan bailout and increase 
costs to the taxpayer 
democrats voting for ryan were sens richard c shelby of 
alabama and terry sanford of north carolina sanford told reporters 
he was a personal friend of ryan while shelby said he believed it 
was important to fill the position quickly and that the full senate 
should vote on the nomination 
the administration has had difficulty finding a nominee since m 
danny wall announced in early december that he would resign it has 
been under pressure to find a replacement because at least five 
thrifts are challenging the thrift offices constitutional 
authority to seize troubled sampls 
last summers sampl legislation automatically gave the directors 
job to wall chairman of the thrift offices predecessor agency 
the federal home loan bank board he was not nominated and 
confirmed for the directors job 
in the latest challenge us district court judge charles a 
legge in san francisco on thursday denied a temporary restraining 
order that would have removed government agents from the helm of 
pacific coast savings and loan assocation a a san franciscobased 
institution with 104 billion in assets 
ryan a former senior labor department official nominated last 
week met skepticism from committee democrats during a hearing on 
his nomination wednesday 
lawmakers questioned his lack of direct experience in banking 
and raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest in his 
work as a private attorney after leaving government in 1983 
as solicitor of the labor department he helped hire former 
attorney general william b saxbe as independent counsel overseeing 
the teamsters union central states pension fund after ryan left 
the government saxbe joined ryans firm bringing with him 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from the fund 
the administration has portrayed ryan as an experienced manager 
who supervised 600 attorneys at the labor department and a tough 
enforcer who helped clean up corruption in the teamsters pension 
fund

when people come into court we expect them to give fair and 
truthful testimony webb said but when a person is so biased 
he turns to wink at someone as if to say did that last answer help 
you john i would have expected more from a former president 
than that webb said 
webb ridiculed reagans defense of three letters poindexter sent 
to congress in july 1986 which falsely denied that the national 
security council staff was secretly orchestrating arms shipments to 
the contras 
the prosecutor recalled that when reagan was shown one of the 
letters the former president said he agreed with its contents and 
added i would have added in a profanity 
he gave that testimony because he hoped it would help john 
poindexter webb said he hadnt the foggiest idea those were 
false letters sent to obstruct congress 
webb a former us attorney in chicago appointed by reagan 
argued that poindexter tore up a document authorizing us 
involvement in iranian arms sales to protect reagan from political 
embarrassment 
this is the one document in the world it puts the lie to what 
ronald reagan told the american people when he denied in a nov 
13 1986 speech that he had sold arms to iran to try to free 
american hostages webb said 
the document an intelligence finding signed by reagan in 
december 1985 authorized the cias involvement a month earlier in 
the shipment of hawk missiles to iran it described the transaction 
as an effort to free us hostages 
reagans speech marked a rather sad day in america webb 
said because even though the decision to trade arms for hostages 
might be defensible you dont lie to the american public 
webb said that poindexter after lying to two congressional 
committees on nov 21 1986 about usiran arms sales returned 
to his office and he tore up the original finding signed by the 
president of the united states 
the prosecutor ripping up a copy of the document to dramatize 
his point said the act of tearing up that finding is strong 
evidence poindexter intended to obstruct congress 
poindexter who served as reagans national security adviser 
from late 1985 until his resignation on nov 25 1986 is also 
accused of deceiving congress about white house involvement in 
covert assistant to the nicaraguan rebels 
webb recounted testimony by former national security council 
aide oliver l north that he was generally instructed by 
poindexter to lie to lawmakers about the secret aid network 
north was there because the defendant on trial in this case 
his commander sent him there to do that webb said the boss 
cant escape legal responsibility just because he didnt get his 
hands dirty

political and economic trends have overtaken 
japans financial markets painfully ending an era during which 
investing in the tokyo stock exchange seemed to be a sure thing 
analysts say 
from the beginning of 1990 through fridays close of trading 
the market that once was the worlds richest had lost 23 percent of 
its value 
the japanese yen also has weakened dropping more than 9 percent 
to about 158 yen to the us dollar after ending last year at 
14345 yen and the dollars rise to a threeyear high against the 
yen has occurred despite heavy dollarselling by japans central 
bank 
market analysts say these trends could continue during the next 
few months as the yen and inflated stock prices readjust to 
political developments and economic realities that have overtaken 
japans monetary authorities and major brokerages 
japans big four securities firms nomura securities daiwa 
securities nikko securities and yamaichi account for about half 
of the tokyo markets total turnover 
their market activity and advice often are credited with pulling 
the market out of slumps such as the oct 20 1987 crash that 
followed the black monday plunge on wall street and with 
instilling the confidence that pushed the key nikkei average up 
almost 20000 points between early 1987 and the end of last year 
when it peaked at 3891587 
theres little doubt the major brokers accounted for lots of 
the market activity in the latter half of last year when the 
market surged by about 4000 points says economist david pike at 
ubs phillips and drew international ltd 
but the late 1989 surge contradicted economic fundamentals by 
reacting to speculation that interest rates were peaking he said 
rather than peaking domestic interest rates have continued 
rising as monetary authorities fight inflationary pressures 
stemming from wage hikes a 3 percent sales tax and the weaker yen 
which raises the cost of fuel and other imports 
japans central bank has raised its discount rate the interest 
it charges on loans to commercial banks four times since last may 
to fight inflation which economists expect to be in the 2 
percent25 percent range this year 
the discount rate which has a strong impact on other interest 
rates was raised to 525 percent on march 20 it was at a historic 
low of 25 percent before the series of increases 
higher interest rates tend to discourage investment in the stock 
market because higher yields can be found in other investments 
analysts see higher rates as the single biggest factor behind the 
stock markets prolonged decline 
the yens decline also has pushed stock prices lower 
higher interest rates generally make a countrys currency more 
attractive to investors by reducing the outflow of capital from 
japan in the long run the discount rate hike could reduce demand 
for dollars and relieve downward selling pressure on the yen 
but the bank of japan was backed into a corner because 
boosting rates was certain to further hurt the stock market says 
peter morgan chief economist at barclays de zoete wedd securities 
japan ltd 
moreover currency dealers had anticipated the latest rate 
increase which so far has failed to help in fact the dollar by 
late friday had risen to 15765 yen from 15270 yen on march 20 
the yen also has suffered due to political developments in the 
soviet union and eastern europe which have strengthened the us 
dollar seen as safest in times of uncertainty 
furthermore western europe has become sexy due to 
expectations of german reunification and the formation of the 
european common market in 1992 luring japanese investors away from 
home markets morgan said 
many analysts say they expect the market to continue declining 
in the short term as it adjusts to factors beyond the control of 
brokerages or monetary authorities 
market sentiment is still deteriorating so we certainly cant 
expect a sharp recovery says susumu kato senior economist at 
goldman sachs japan 
this year higher borrowing costs will depress capital 
investment and the weaker yen will increase the cost of imports 
cutting into corporate earnings says lawrence s prager chief 
analyst and strategist at nikko securities co 
but in the long run japans powerhouse economy will take the 
adjustments in stride analysts say 
these are not caused by major economic problems but are a 
matter of sentiment says kermit l schoenholtz senior economist 
at salomon brothers asia ltd the economy is extraordinarily 
competitive and the weaker yen will further boost its export 
competitiveness

campeau corp on friday said it will not pay interest due 
saturday on two debts and wants to defer the payments while the 
retailing and real estate company develops a longterm business 
plan 
the canadian company said it owes the semiannual payments on 
two of its outstanding bond issues 
one of the issues worth 184 million canadian dollars is 
publicly traded and the other worth 260 million is owned by 
olympia amp york developments ltd a big torontobased property 
company 
richard w wertheim a campeau spokesman said the interest due 
on the publicly owned bonds is 69 million canadian dollars and the 
amount due on the olympia amp york bonds is slightly less than 13 
million 
campeau said in a news release that it could be in default on 
the two issues if it doesnt pay the interest by april 30 however 
it said it intends to pursue discussions on deferring the payments 
wertheim said campeau is fairly confident that the creditors 
will agree to temporarily waive the interest payments 
he also said the company is encouraged by the progress it has 
made in discussions with its various creditors on a longterm 
business plan 
he declined to specify what the plan might entail but said it 
will address running the business in the future and will deal with 
campeaus debt situtation in some way 
were rather optimistic that we can work our way through 
this he said 
analysts have speculated that campeaus business plan could 
include a restructuring of debt and major asset sales some outside 
observers have questioned whether campeau will be able to survive 
in its existing form or stay in business at all 
campeau based in toronto owns commercial real estate 
including office buildings and shopping centers its properties 
mainly are in the canadian cities of toronto montreal and ottawa 
the current debt woes facing campeau are related to but 
separate from the problems of its two us retailing units allied 
stores corp and federated department stores inc which are in 
bankruptcy proceedings 
campeaus acquisition of allied and federated in 1986 and 1988 
saddled the two department store operators with heavy debts allied 
and federated listed debts totaling 77 billion when they filed 
for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the us 
bankruptcy act in january

soybean futures prices surged in late trading 
friday to close strongly higher on the chicago board of trade 
while grain futures finished mixed ahead of two eagerly awaited 
government reports 
trading had been quiet for much of the session as players staked 
out positions ahead of the agriculture departments quarterly grain 
stocks report and annual report on spring planting intentions 
joel karlin an analyst with research department inc in 
chicago attributed the late buying of soybean futures to talk that 
the prospective corn plantings number would be higher and the 
soybean number lower than the markets had earlier anticipated 
analysts had expected the report to show that us farmers 
intend to increase corn acreage this year by 4 percent to 752 
million acres from 723 million acres decrease soybean acreage by 
36 percent to 585 million acres from 607 million and decrease 
spring wheat acreage by about 1 percent to 175 million acres from 
177 million 
the report which was released after the close showed plans for 
a 35 percent increase in corn to 748 million acres a 21 percent 
decline in soybeans to 594 million acres and a 4 percent decline 
in spring wheat acreage to 17 million acres 
wheat futures settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 351 a bushel corn futures were 
cent to 1 cents higher with may at 261 a bushel oats were 3 
cents to 3 cents higher with may at 150 a bushel soybeans were

hallmark cards inc on friday sweetened the 
terms of its proposed buyback of 270 million in junk bonds issued 
by its univision holdings inc subsidiary after its first offer 
received a very chilly response 
under the revised offer hallmark would pay about 49 cents on 
the dollar for the two series of securities up from about 39 cents 
on the dollar under the initial offer that was to have expired 
early friday 
but the greeting card company warned that if the tender offers 
are unsuccessful univision will file for protection from its 
creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code the 
hallmark board approved that course of action at a meeting earlier 
this week the kansas city mobased company said 
a financial advisor to the bondholders called the revised offers 
constructive and indicated the bondholders intended to review 
them over the weekend and discuss them among themselves on monday 
univision owns eight television stations and operates the 
nations biggest spanishlanguage television network which reaches 
92 percent of the hispanic households in the country 
in announcing the revised offer for the bond debt hallmark and 
univision also said they had reached an agreement in principle with 
univisions bank lending group on a plan that reschedules payments 
on 315 million owed to banks and increases the availability of 
funds to univision 
hallmark also said it had agreed with the banks that if the 
restructuring of univisions debt is completed hallmark will defer 
interest payments on the securities tendered for seven years rather 
than the five years earlier proposed 
company executives say that while univisions business is 
growing the company has run into stiffer than expected competition 
and has been unable to meet the terms of its current financial 
structure 
univision missed 10 million in interest payments that were due 
feb 1 to its bank lenders and bondholders citing insufficient 
cash flow 
several days later hallmark launched a plan to rescue univision 
that included paying 10575 million for its 270 million in bond 
debt 
but hallmark said that with one day left under its onceextended 
tender offers that were to have expired at 1201 am friday only 
8 percent of one issue and 4 percent of the other had been 
tendered hallmark wanted at least 95 percent of the bonds tendered 
under the initial offers 
the revised tender offers are scheduled to expire at 1201 am 
friday april 13 and hallmark lowered the minimum acceptable 
amount to 90 percent 
hallmark paid about 600 million to acquire the univision 
network and tv stations over three years ended in 1988 it owns a 
635 percent stake in univision while first chicago investment 
corp holds 215 percent and a private trust owns the remainder 
wilbur ross senior managing director at rothschild inc which 
is serving as financial advisor to holders of a majority of the 
univision bonds said the first hallmark offer had been pretty 
much rejected out of hand 
but he said the new offers which hallmark valued at 131 
million were about 25 percent higher than the first ones valued at 
106 million 
we regard this as a very constructive development it is a 
good faith offer no decision has yet been made but people are 
taking this offer quite seriously ross said 
among the issues which will be studied he said are the 
sufficiency of the offers and how they allocate values between the 
two debt issues 
hallmark said that under the revised offer it would pay 
553 per 1000 principal amount for the 165 million in senior 
subordinated discount notes up from 450 per 1000 principal 
amount 
379 per 1000 in principal amount for the 105 million in 13rsqb 
percent subordinated debentures up from 300 per 1000 principal 
amount

deliveries last year for a record 124 billion in revenues about 
7 billion more than its nearest rival federal express 
the company that proclaims in advertisements we run the 
tightest ship in the shipping business started as a messenger 
service in seattle in 1907 then quickly got into the package 
business by delivering packages for department stores to their 
customers 
the next 70 years were spent expanding ground service to all 
corners of the country a task it essentially accomplished in 1978 
air delivery was started on a limited basis in 1929 but was 
terminated a few years later in the midst of the depression ups 
restarted it in 1953 and expanded it nationwide in 1980 
going head to head with the postal service ups also strove to 
be the fastest and least expensive carrier hiring engineers to 
poke around and find places to save a dime here or a moment there 
the seats on the trucks were designed so drivers can slip off 
easily plexiglas skylights were installed in vans to eliminate 
overhead lights 
drivers are taught to toot their horns before deliveries so the 
customer comes to the door even the pockets of their pants are 
designed to make it easy to make change for customers 
but while ups was becoming more efficient on the ground other 
players snuck into the game and soared above them in the air 
freight business federal express which began in 1973 reported 1 
billion in annual revenues by 1983 dhl based in brussels became 
the first worldwide shipper to serve the soviet union in 1985 and 
china in 1988 
suddenly ups had to play catchup 
our customers began telling us they needed a nextday air 
service says john alden group manager of business development 
forcing ups into overnight air delivery 
ups responded quickly it bought 20 planes in 198182 began 
overnight delivery and expanded to 88 percent of the country in a 
single year it bought 52 more planes through 1985 and by the end 
of the year had overnight service in every state but alaska 
it also launched international service in 1985 starting with 
six european countries expanding to 16 countries in 1986 163 
countries by april 1989 and 175 countries by august ups entered 
eastern europe last december expanding its scope to more than 180 
countries 
this year ups began flying its own planes to hong kong and south 
korea which meant the company was able to end a contract with 
flying tiger international inc federal express bought flying tiger 
last year which had put ups in the uncomfortable position of 
having the competition carry its packages 
analysts believe more than one carrier can flourish in the 
delivery business partly because of an enormous growth in the 
number of international businesses and the need for speedily moving 
goods between countries 
the shippers i come in contact with always find ways to keep 
two guys in business said tony robertson a securities analyst 
at the alex brown amp sons inc brokerage of baltimore that way 
they ward off heavy price increases 
ups for its part plans to add more planes and expand service 
overseas its also adopting new hightechnology efficiencies for 
home and abroad like a computer system that will provide drivers 
with the fastest way to work their routes or determine the closest 
driver when someone calls for a pickup 
another innovation is an automated sorting system that will 
route a package by reading a code the size of a postage stamp 
ups also is developing a system to alert customs officials about 
package contents costs and addresses before parcels arrive on a 
foreign front cutting down the time it takes to inspect and bill 
each package 
you reach a point where you cant save any more on standard 
efficiencies alden said now you ask what else can you do and 
thats where we hope technology can truly help us 
ups officials have predicted the company wont make a profit 
until 1993 from international operations they also have 
acknowledged that the competition is working just as hard on the 
kinds of expansions and improvements ups is banking on 
the next 10 years are going to be tremendous challenges but 
tremendous opportunities alden said international is just 
beginning and theres going to be tremendous expansion in our 
service around the world

eastern airlines on friday blasted rumors that the 
carrier faces liquidation as it tries to overcome growing 
skepticism about its ability to survive 
eastern which last year promised to repay creditors 100 percent 
then slashed that by half this week said it wanted to cut the 50 
centsperdollar payback plan even further immediately afterward 
unsecured creditors discussed a potential call for easterns 
liquidation 
eastern took the unusual step of releasing a statement in which 
president phil bakes denounced the latest wild rumors 
liquidation is not in the best interests of any group involved 
in the bankruptcy spokesman robin matell said the unsecured 
creditors would wind up with little at best and maybe nothing in 
liquidation 
we think the creditors stance is a negotiating position 
if it ws in their best interests they would have advocated it long 
ago eventually reason is going to take hold and prevail matell 
said adding that negotiations were continuing with the creditors 
frank ortis local president of the striking machinists union 
said the union was delighted with the unsecured creditors 
discussion which he said moves us closer to what weve wanted 
all along to buy the airline 
eastern charged in its statement that the liquidation 
speculation is being orchestrated by bitter unions who nearly 
destroyed eastern a year ago and are trying to do it through 
vicious rumors and leaks at the early stages of confidential 
committee deliberations 
some reports this week indicated the parent texas air corp was 
encouraging creditors to hold off on liquidation talk until final 
approval of the sale of easterns latin american routes to american 
airlines 
approved thursday by bankruptcy judge burton lifland the sale 
needs approval from the us department of transportation and 
foreign governments involved 
matell said the sale could be approved as early as april 6 
clearing the way for bringing 349 million directly to eastern in a 
threeway deal that also will give texas air some of the proceeds 
eastern is in a strong cash position with some 800 million 
already matell said and the carrier reported good response to a 
new ynot promotion that courts business travellers with 
firstclass fares 15 percent below standard coach fares 
however eastern has consistently fallen short of revenues 
projections mainly because frequent business fliers the strongest 
revenue base for most airlines are leery of eastern the carrier 
was hit march 4 1989 by a paralyzing strike filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization five days later and has slowly rebuilt 
while repeatedly missing bankruptcy deadlines and revenue 
projections 
bakes statement said eastern is going ahead with plans to add 
seven daily roundtrip flights this sunday between atlanta and the 
cities of new orleans norfolk va richmond va 
greenvillespartanburg sc and the florida cities of fort myers 
pensacola and sarasota 
eastern has about 800 daily flights compared to 1080 before 
the strike it had just 100 a day in the first weeks of the strike 
eastern is running better than ever bakes said our 
domestic load factor this month is 68 percent and were operating 
99 percent of our scheduled flights

a judge on friday dismissed the suit american 
continental corp filed against federal regulators which accused 
them of hurting the survival chances of its lincoln savings and 
loan association subsidiary by leaking confidential information 
us district judge richard m bilby agreed to dismiss the case 
without prejudice meaning it may be refiled or reopened but bilby 
added that unless american continental took action by july 1 the 
claim would be dismissed with prejudice 
bilby precipitated a march 7 motion by american continental to 
dismiss the suit when he barred the company from continuing to pay 
lawyers to pursue the case he cited the fear that attorneys fees 
would use up the equity in american continental 
the companys legal bill had been reaching 1 million a month 
in other action during the session bilby approved american 
continentals plan to raise 700000 through the sale of stock and 
agreed to give los angeles county district attorney ira reiner 
access to the voluminous documents in the case 
reiner said two weeks ago that his office planned to prosecute 
the decisionmakers responsible for selling junk bonds through 
irvine califbased lincoln more than 23000 investors claim they 
were not warned of the risks in buying the uninsured bonds and lost 
more than 200 million when the thrift failed 
american continental filed for reorganization under chapter 11 
last april 13 and the government seized lincoln the next day 
american continental filed suit against the regulators last 
springbilby combined the bankruptcy case and the suit early this 
year 
the suit claimed regulators caused it more than 100 million in 
losses through repeated unlawful disclosures to the press 
the defendants named in the suit included m danny wall 
director of the office of thrift supervision darrel w dochow the 
acting principal supervisory agent for lincoln and william k 
black general counsel of the federal home loan bank board in san 
francisco 
american continental added edwin j gray former chairman of the 
fhlbb to the suit in january but bilby later severed gray from 
trial with the others he was included in bilbys blanket dismissal 
the suit alleged that rosemary stewart the top enforcement 
attorney for the office of thrift supervision acknowledged in 
congressional testimony that gray and black were engaged in a 
vendetta against lincoln 
ann timmer who represented black argued for dismissal with 
prejudice 
my client doesnt want to have a cloud hanging over his head 
that says the only reason this case is dismissed is a lack of 
money for lawyers fees she said 
david g fiske representing dochow said his client should not 
be included among the defendants because the alleged vendetta dated 
back to 1984 and dochow the former director of the home loan bank 
boards office of regulatory affairs didnt enter the scene until 
1987 
attorney robert milligan countered for american continental that 
dochow was at least as culpable as the others for getting on the 
horn with the orange county calif register and telling a 
reporter that lincoln had to be sold immediately or the government 
would seize it 
that article had an adverse effect on lincoln there were huge 
runs by investors milligan said 
it had the effect of causing people who might be interested in 
financing the purchase of lincoln from acc to say im not going 
to get involved he added 
the government has estimated the lincoln failure may cost 
taxpayers 2 billion the most expensive sampl bailout yet 
milligan argued that press coverage was slanted against the 
corporation and charles h keating jr founder and chairman of the 
phoenixbased development company keating members of his family 
and other insiders are accused in a 11 billion federal deposit 
insurance corp civil suit of plundering lincoln to support 
keatings 37 millionayear salary and lavish development schemes 
the case acquired more notoriety with reports that keating 
contributed more than 13 million to the campaign treasuries five 
us senators who met with federal regulators on his behalf in 1987

the perjury conviction of former drexel burnham 
lambert inc trading assistant lisa jones was upheld friday by a 
federal appeals court but her 18month jail sentence was thrown 
out 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled the trial judge 
wrongly gave her a sentence greater than the 10 to 16month term 
recommended by new sentencing guidelines the case was sent back to 
us district judge leonard b sand for resentencing 
the threejudge panel said sands reason for lengthening the 
sentence that jones perjury severely impeded the governments 
drexel investigation was not justified 
a federal jury in march 1989 found jones guilty on five counts 
of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to a 
federal grand jury in january 1988 in an investigation of trading 
involving drexel 
these instances of perjury standing alone do not constitute 
the type of egregious conduct envisioned by the guidelines as 
substantial interference with the administration of justice the 
24page appeals court opinion said 
jones who left home at age 14 climbed to a 100000ayear job 
as an assistant bond trader in drexels highyield junk bond 
department in beverly hills calif formerly run by nowindicted 
executive michael milken 
in three appearances before the federal grand jury jones said 
she did not recall any discussions about stock parking in 
contacts with princetonnewport partners lp a defunct investment 
firm whose principals were convicted of securities fraud in july 
parking refers to placing stock temporarily with another party 
to hide its true ownership the practice is illegal when it is used 
to circumvent regulations that require stockholders to disclose 
shares they own in companies 
the appeals court upheld her conviction by ruling against three 
issues raised by her lawyer in the appeal that jones was denied 
effective counsel by her trial attorney that the prosecutor 
conducted an improper crossexamination when she testified at 
trial and that the judge made an incomplete examination of a juror 
whose son was a federal prosecutor in new jersey 
jones attorney daniel bookin said he had not decided whether 
to appeal her conviction further he would not comment on the 
appeals court decision 
her resentencing was not yet scheduled

cbs inc plans to eliminate dozens of jobs in an 
effort to cut costs published reports said friday 
a cbs spokesman who was asked about the reports said only that 
the company was looking more closely at every opening before 
filling vacant spots 
the new york times reported in fridays editions that 
unidentified network executives said cbs plans to cut dozens of 
employees from its staff either through a strict review of all 
job openings or dismissals spaced out slowly

specific target date or number set

officials said cbs news plans to eliminate about 50 positions 
mainly through attrition

budget was cut by 33 million the report said 
asked about the reports cbs vice president george schweitzer 
said there is no mandated staff reduction 
when a job comes open we look at it more closely he said 
he described the exercise as prudent management and said 
jobs still are being filled in some cases

federal reserve policy makers decided at their 
february meeting to continue their high interest rate policies to 
keep inflationary pressures under control according to minutes 
released friday 
the federal funds rate has remained steady at 825 percent since 
the fed permitted it to drop from 85 percent on dec 21 following 
the previous fed policy meeting on dec 1819 
the federal funds rate is the interest banks charge each other 
for overnight loans and is the primary lever the fed uses to 
control shortterm interest rates 
the policymaking body the federal open market committee met 
again tuesday and analysts believe it voted to continue current 
policies minutes of that meeting will not be released until may 
the committee holds closed meetings eight times a year to 
formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed it 
consists of the seven federal reserve board members and five of the 
12 presidents of the fed district banks 
at the fomc meeting feb 67 the information on economic 
conditions suggested continued but sluggish expansion in 
overall economic activity with conditions uneven across sectors 
the minutes read 
industrial activity remained weak partly because of the 
depressing effects of an inventory correction on manufacturing 
output while the serviceproducing sector of the economy continued 
to grow moderately they continued 
the minutes stated that prices increased more slowly over most 
of the second half of 1989 but unusually cold wather in december 
put temporary upward pressure on food and energy prices 
and they added the staff projection prepared for this 
meeting suggested that the economy was likely to expand relatively 
slowly over the next several quarters 
but while the policymakers generally agreed that continuing 
growth in economic activity remained a reasonable expectation for 
the year ahead the minutes said members acknowledged that 
there were considerable risks and some did not rule out the 
possibility of a downturn 
at the conclusion of the meeting the fomc voted 83 not to 
change policies although they agreed some firming or easing of 
credit would be acceptable depending on economic developments

companies with new stock offerings would have 
to show they have twice as much capital and assets than they do now 
to be listed on the national association of securities dealers 
stock quote system under a proposed rule change 
trading in as many as 500 penny stocks could be eliminated 
from the nasdaq stock market under the proposed rule which comes 
partly in response to a federal crackdown on fraud in the lowcost 
securities 
the nasd the selfregulatory agency that oversees the 
overthecounter stock market said thursday it would seek 
securities and exchange commission approval to raise the standards 
companies must meet to be listed on the nasdaq stock system 
nasdaq stands for the national association of securities dealers 
automated quotations system a computerized stock price quotation 
system owned and operated by the nasd 
penny stocks lowcost highrisk securities that usually trade 
for less than a dollar are often prone to fraud because most are 
not listed on any stock exchange or the nasdaq system about 5000 
stocks currently trade on nasdaq 
the new standards will not affect about 2700 stocks traded on 
the nasdaq national market which already has a higher standard 
the changes if approved by the sec would not go into effect 
until next january to give already listed companies time to meet 
the new rule 
also the nasd plans to provide an alternative system the otc 
bulletin board for companies with securities that are not eligible 
for listing on the nasdaq 
the service available through computer terminal screens would 
allow members for the first time to enter update and view price 
quotes on overthecounter stocks not listed on nasdaq brokers 
would not be able to execute trades through the bulletin board 
system however 
the new standards adopted by the nasds board of governors 
earlier this month would require companies issuing stock for the 
first time to have a minimum of 4 million in total assets and 2 
million in capital and surplus compared to the present 
requirements of 2 million and 1 million 
in addition to the currently required 100000 shares of public 
float for an issue the float would have to have a market value of 
1 million float is the term used to describe the number of public 
shares circulating in the market 
stocks would have to have a minimum bid price of 3 per share 
there is no minimum required now 
maintaining a stock listing on nasdaq under the new rule would 
require a company to have 2 million in assets instead of the 
750000 in effect now also 1 million in capital surplus up 
from 375000 would be required the float would have to have a 
market value of 200000 and the stock would be required to have a 
1 minimum bid price 
nasd executive vice president john t wall said the changes 
reflected the effects of inflation since the requirements were last 
amended in 1981 
also prompting the changes was a jan 10 letter from the sec 
expressing concern that unscrupulous promoters might seek to 
circumvent tougher rules for selling penny stocks by acquiring a 
listing on nasdaq stock market 
such a listing would exempt them from the sec rule requiring a 
clients written consent to buy stocks not listed by nasdaq or a 
stock exchange

a top gaf corp executive was sentenced friday 
to six months in prison and the company was fined 2 million for 
stock manipulation convictions stemming from the governments 
crackdown on wall street crime 
us district judge mary johnson lowe said she ordered a prison 
term for gaf vice chairman james t sherwin because his conviction 
should be used as a lesson to others who may be tempted to engage 
in conduct such as this 
sherwin 56 and gaf were convicted in december on eight counts 
of stock manipulation securities fraud conspiracy and 
recordkeeping violations in a scheme to boost the stock price of 
union carbide corp after a failed takeover 
gaf a wayne nj speciality chemicals concern was the first 
company outside of wall street to be convicted in the governments 
insider trading investigation that began in 1986 the gaf case was 
based on information indirectly supplied by convicted arbitrager 
ivan boesky 
i do not believe that a sentence should be imposed upon you to 
punish you as a person lowe told sherwin i do this with 
heavy heart because i believe you are a good man 
but the judge said she felt compelled to issue prison time to 
send a message to wall street that if financial market participants 
break the law there will be a prison sentence at the end of the 
road 
gaf attorney arthur liman said an appeal was planned sherwin 
remains free pending appeal under the sentence liman said 
sherwin would have to serve five months in prison with one month 
off for good behavior 
sherwin who once was the nations thirdranked chess player 
slumped in his chair as the verdict was read he declined to 
comment afterward and was embraced by his tearful wife two of his 
three daughters and three stepdaughters 
the case attracted wide attention on wall street when gaf two 
subsidiaries and sherwin were indicted in july 1988 for allegedly 
trying to inflate the price of union carbide stock in 1986 the 
illegal action allegedly occurred shortly before gaf sold a large 
block of union carbide shares it acquired in an unsuccessful 
takeover attempt 
the case endured two mistrials the first in early 1989 after 
the government inadvertently withheld a key piece of evidence and 
the second after a jury was unable to reach a verdict after 12 days 
of deliberations 
gaf a chemicals and building parts manufacturer faced a 
maximum fine of 4 million sherwin faced a maximum five years in 
prison and 250000 fine on each count 
the parties recently paid 125 million to settle a civil 
lawsuit with the securities and exchange commission on similar 
allegations as in the criminal case 
judge lowe sentenced sherwin to six months in prison on one 
count each of stock manipulation and recordkeeping violations she 
suspended sentence on the other six counts and placed sherwin on 
one year probation 
the government did not recommend a prison term for sherwin 
saying only that a substantial sentence was warranted 
the manipulation was done purely out of greed and not out of 
financial necessity the government said in its sentencing 
memorandum in short the scheme was calculated and 
wellplanned 
sherwin his voice cracking told lowe any sentence the judge 
deems appropriate i am prepared to accept 
stephen kaufman sherwins attorney asked lowe to order only 
community service he said sherwin has a stellar reputation in 
business is active in human rights causes and was not a 
systemic violator 
this was an aberrational act an isolated act an act totally 
out of character with anything hes done in his life kaufman 
said 
lowe said she could not recall a case in her 18 years as a judge 
that had caused me more anguish in attempting to fashion an 
appropriate sentence 
prosecutors based their case on testimony of former los angeles 
stockbroker boyd l jefferies he testified that sherwin directed 
him to buy large blocks of union carbide in late 1986 in an attempt 
to raise its price to 22 a share and agreed to pay 40000 to 
cover his losses 
a higher stock price would have meant more money for gaf which 
had accumulated 10 million shares of union carbide during the 
failed takeover bid that year gaf later sold 5 million shares to 
salomon brothers inc for 23 a share 
jefferies also played a key role in two other securities fraud 
convictions last year of florida investor paul a bilzerian and 
arbitrager salim b lewis bilzerian was sentenced to prison while 
jefferies and lewis were fined and ordered to perform community 
service

bond prices lost ground friday in light to 
moderate activity reflecting concerns that next weeks economic 
reports may indicate some lingering strength that could keep the 
pressure on interest rates 
the bellwether 30year treasury bond fell rsqb point or 375 for 
every 1000 in face value 
its yield which rises when the price falls climbed to 862 
percent from 858 percent late thursday its yield had been 847 
percent only a week ago 
prices were weighed down by a report from a midwestern 
purchasing managers group that suggested the economy is fairly 
strong according to kevin flanagan money market economist for 
dean witter reynolds inc 
he said the market is also concerned that japanese investors 
under pressure from their government to support the yen may not 
buy as many treasury bonds as they would otherwise over the next 
few months 
some traders stayed out of the market while they await a pair of 
important economic reports next week the latest monthly survey by 
the national association of purchasing management and the march 
unemployment figures 
the purchasing management association of chicago reported friday 
that its index of area business activity rose to 551 percent in 
march from 51 percent in february it was the highest reading since 
april 
a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing 
sector and a reading below 50 indicates contraction 
the chicago index is based on a survey of company purchasing 
managers in northern illinois and northwestern indiana one of the 
largest industrial areas in the country it was viewed as an 
indication that nationwide business conditions may show improvement 
as well 
evidence of a revival in the economy would be hurt the bond 
market because it would reinforce the belief that the federal 
reserve might be leaning toward tightening its credit policy by 
nudging up interest rates bond prices recede when interest rates 
rise 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm government issues fell 132 point intermediate 
maturities lost lsqb point and longterm issues fell as much as 1532 
point according to figures provided by telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 131 to 114850 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell lsqb point to 91 732 the average yield 
to maturity edged up to 752 percent from 751 percent late 
thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills dipped to 805 percent as 
the discount declined 4 basis points to 779 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 822 percent as the discount dropped 3 
basis points to 780 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 832 
percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to 775 percent

copper futures prices jumped to new lifeofcontract highs 
friday on new yorks commodity exchange amid fears of a miners 
strike in papua new guinea and perceptions of a sharp drop in 
deliverable supplies of copper in london 
on other commodity markets precious metals retreated grains 
and soybeans were mixed livestock and meat futurs were mixed and 
petroleum futures advanced 
copper futures settled 17 cents to 45 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in april up 34 cents at 1269 a pound 
eclipsing the high of 125 set by the april contract on march 22 
prices were supported in part by sketchy rumors of labor tension 
at the ok tedi copper mining complex in papua new guinea a small 
nation in the south pacific whose bougainville copper complex was 
shut down nearly 11 months ago after attacks by irate landowners 
bill steele an analyst with the brokers advisory service 
research department inc in chicago was skeptical of the rumors 
the fact that there are no details leads me to believe its 
yet another bullish argument in a market that thrives on any 
bullish news he said 
the market ignored potentially bearish news that 1250 workers 
at highland valley copper cos mine near logan lake british 
columbia may be ordered back to work by the government ending a 
threeday wildcat strike 
meanwhile a strike against the southern peru copper corp 
stretched into its nineteenth day friday and the company was said 
to be seeking a stateofemergency declaration from the government 
to force miners back to work 
buying also was linked to expectations that mondays weekly 
stocks report from the london metal exchange will show a decline of 
5000 to 10000 metric tons of copper certified as deliverable 
against futures contracts there 
precious metal futures edged lower on the commodity exchange in 
another day of cautious trading following mondays collapse of gold 
prices to fivemonth lows 
gold futures settled 60 cents to 220 lower with april at 
37020 a troy ounce silver was 01 cent to 05 cent lower with 
april at 4945 a troy ounce 
soybean futures surged in late trading and settled strongly 
higher on the cdicago board of trade while grain futures finished 
mixed ahead of two eagerly awaited government reports that were 
released after the close 
the agriculture departments annual prospective plantings report 
indicated us farmers intend to increase corn acreage 35 percent 
this year to 748 million acres decrease soybean acreage 21 
percent to 594 million acres and decrease spring wheat plantings 4 
percent to 17 million acres 
analysts had expected a larger gain in projected corn acreage a 
bigger drop in soybean acreage and a smaller decrease in spring 
wheat 
the other usda report a quarterly estimate of grain stocks 
showed supplies of soybeans corn and wheat to be slightly lower 
than expected 
analysts pronounced the reports slightly bearish for soybean 
futures and slightly bullish for the corn and wheat markets 
wheat futures settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with may 
at 351 a bushel corn futures were cent to 1 cents higher 
with may at 261 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 3 cents higher 
with may at 150 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents 
higher with may at 595 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange cattle futures finished 
mixed while most pork futures advanced ahead of the usdas 
quarterly hogsandpigs inventory report 
the report showed the nations hog herd as of march 1 to be 4 
percent smaller than a year earlier the market had anticipated a 
larger herd so the report was expected to prompt some buying of 
hog futures on monday 
live cattle futures settled 30 cent lower to 12 cent higher 
with april at 7787 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent 
lower to 20 cent higher with april at 8215 cents a pound live 
hogs were 02 cent lower to 50 cent higher with april at 5340 
cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 33 cent lower to 93 cent 
higher with may at 5357 cents a pound 
petroleum futures rose moderately on the new york mercantile 
exchange boosted by news of a threatened soviet oil workers strike 
in western siberia and by buying linked to the expiration of the 
april heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts the contracts 
went off the board at 5702 cents and 5993 cents a gallon 
respectively 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 25 cents 
higher with may at 2028 a barrel heating oil was 18 cent to 56 
cent higher with may at 5434 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
45 cent to 55 cent higher with may at 6536 cents a gallon

merck amp co has appointed its first woman 
chief financial officer placing her in charge of about 2 billion 
in investments and pension funds at the pharmaceutical giant 
the appointment puts judy c lewent 41 who was also named vice 
president for finance among a small group of women to be appointed 
cfo of a major us corporation 
i do believe i was given this job on the merits and against 
stiff competition ms lewent said in a telephone interview 
friday from the companys headquarters in rahway 
i think there are still some more firsts for women to achieve 
but i think the appointment is a function of having the time and 
the experience to achieve it said ms lewent who was also 
appointed vice president for finance 
the phenomenon ive seen in my own career is tat there were 
not a lot of women coming out of business schools with mbas in the 
early 1970s ms lewent said 
mercks board of directors thursday elected ms lewent a 
graduate of the massachusetts institute of technologys sloan 
school of management to oversee all financial matters for merck 
which had 66 billion in sales last year 
the appointment makes ms lewent the highest ranking woman at 
the company and one of a handful of women who have served as cfos 
at major us corporations said merck spokesman john doorley 
weve done pretty thorough research and we dont know of any 
other major corporation currently with a woman as a chief 
financial officer doorley said 
ms lewent who lives with her husband in new york city 
succeeds alfred smith who retired at the end of 1989 
ms lewents responsibilities include supervision of the 
companys 1 billion in cash and shortterm investments and 1 
billion in pension funds 
her goals include developing a strategy to protect the companys 
overseas sales from losses incurred by wide swings in foreign 
currencies 
on the domestic side ms lewent said the industry needs an 
articulate spokesperson to rebut congressional critics who have 
sought to bring pharmaceutical pricing under federal control 
we are spending huge amounts on research and development to 
bring breakthrough drugs to the market she said 
theres got to be a marketplace that understands we need an 
adequate return ms lewent said 
ms lewent joined merck in 1980 as director of acquisitions and 
capital analysis 
she was promoted to assistant controller of the merck sharp amp 
dohme research laboratories in 1983 and to executive director of 
financial evaluation and analysis in 1985 
she was promoted to vice president and treasurer in 1987 
reporting to francis h spiegel jr senior vice president she 
will continue to report to spiegel

telecommunications inc the nations biggest 
cable television system operator says it will divest about 17 
billion in assets that will include all of its cable programming 
interests except its 22 percent stake in turner broadcasting 
systems inc 
john malone chairman of the company said the new company has 
not been named he said it will also include selected cable systems 
malone said tci will conduct the spinoff through a stock rights 
offering to existing shareholders who will be allowed to acquire 
stock in the new company by paying for it with some of their 
interest in tci 
tci intends to keep a minority interest in the new company 
the proposal replaces a plan that tci announced in january under 
which it envisioned spinning off to shareholders substantially all 
of its cable interests into a new company 
robert thomson a tci executive said the company devised the 
new plan because of uncertainties about how congress may handle 
calls to impose new regulations on cable operations 
he said the new plan would enable tci to retain an interest in 
the programming company while those decisions are being made he 
said the company could later divest its stake if congress requires 
it but would still have an interest in programming if congress 
does not 
tci has been criticized for becoming too powerful in the three 
years since the industry was deregulated and feels the spinoff 
will relieve some of the pressure by breaking off some of those 
assets 
malone at the companys annual investors conference on 
thursday said tci will offer shareholders a first opportunity at 
ownership 
we have it on the advice of counsel we could do something like 
that in four months we are proceeding forthwith he said 
malone said peter barton now senior vice president for 
programming for tci will head the new company 
according to company officials the new company would consist of 
one management team presiding over several cable programming 
companies the new company would develop programming and promote 
the programs on other channels it has a stake in 
the new companys assets will include a 50 percent stake in 
viacom incs showtime networks inc tcis sports programming 
interests and a 50 percent interest in discovery channel inc 
malone said the company will retain its 22 percent stake in 
turner broadcasting which includes common and preferred stock 
valued at 950 million 
the turner company operates the cable news network cnn headline

btr plc of britain sought a federal injunction 
friday to keep norton co from delaying a shareholder proxy fight 
after norton rejected a 16 billion buyout bid 
the request was contained in a lawsuit that also challenges 
massachusetts antitakeover law and nortons poison pill 
defense against hostile bidders norton countersued friday seeking 
to halt btrs tender offer and proxy solicitation 
btr a londonbased industrial conglomerate announced its 
75pershare bid earlier this month for norton a leading 
manufacturer of abrasives 
on thursday worcesterbased norton turned down the offer 
calling it inadequate its board of directors said it was 
canceling the companys annual meeting scheduled for april 26 and 
set a special shareholders meeting for june 26 
the board said it needed more time to explore its options 
including the possibility of attracting a minority investor to help 
thwart the bid 
but btrs complaint filed in us district court in boston 
said nortons bylaws prohibit the annual meeting from being 
rescheduled within 60 days of the date set for the meeting 
the british firm said it was prepared to enter a proxy fight at 
the annual meeting to elect its own slate of directors to the 
company 
the change in the meeting date will destroy the opportunity 
for the norton shareholders to hear the platform of the btr 
nominees the complaint said 
norton in its lawsuit accused btr of making false and 
misleading public statements about its plans for the company 
btr intentionally has tried to obfuscate the critical facts 
concerning its past acquisitions and employment practices in which 
the company has repeatedly closed or relocated plants fired 
large numbers of employees and retaliated against organized labor 
and attempts by workers to organize 
btrs lawsuit claimed massachusetts antitakeover law is 
unconstitutional judith fabricant an assistant attorney general 
said the complaint essentially is moot because the state has not 
enforced the statute since a federal court raised questions about 
its validity in 1988 
we do not intend to enforce it she said but we are not 
taking a position to whether it is valid or not valid 
the lawsuit seeks an injunction against nortons poison pill 
plan which would boost the cost of a takeover unless the board of 
directors consents to the offer btr claims the plan breaches the 
companys duty to stockholders 
the state however has challenged btrs claims saying nortons 
responsibility is not limited to its shareholders 
under massachusetts law a company targeted for a takeover also 
may consider the impact on employees customers suppliers the 
community and the state economy fabricant said

federated stores inc the parent company of 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp on friday 
asked that it be placed under chapter 11 protection of the us 
bankrupty court 
the two subsidiaries filed for similar protection in january 
g william miller chairman and chief executive officer of the 
parent company said the petition was a procedural step to allow 
us to expedite the reorganization planning process 
as the parent company of federated and allied fsi is of 
necessity concerned with the total debt structure of these 
companies as well as in helping to effect a solution to the 
financial difficulties imposed by this structure miller said 
by bringing fsi more directly into the chapter 11 process we 
will be able to approach a reorganizatin solution for federated and 
allied in a consistent and logical manner and in a way that makes 
the most sense for the companies and their creditors 
the parent company whose officers and headquarters are in 
cincinnati said the filing was made in us bankruptcy court in 
san francisco although the federated and allied divisions filed 
their chapter 11 proceedings in us bankrutpcy court in 
cincinnati the parent said it filed in san francisco because that 
court has jurisdiction over other chapter 11 proceedings by some of 
its intermediate holding companies 
allen i questrom chairman and chief executive officer of the 
federated and allied divisions issued a statement aimed at 
separating the action of the parent company from the daytoday 
retail operations 
because todays action by fsi has absolutely no effect 
whatsoever on the ongoing businesses of federated and allied we 
want to avoid any risk of confusion or misunderstanding by assuring 
that the record is set straight from the onset questrom said 
the department store operations of federated and allied remain 
sound and profitable sales are steadily improving and are now 
runing ahead of plan the companies cash position is excellent 
we have stabilized our work force and our organizations our 
employees are receiving all of the pay and benefits to which they 
are entitled and we have returned to normal operations in 
virtually all areas of our business and at all levels of our 
companies across the country 
federated stores formerly known as campeau corp us was 
formed as the us retailing subsidiary of torontobased campeau 
corp which is owned primarily by canadian real estate developer 
robert campeau 
campeau said in a statement friday that it had amended 
agreements with edward j debartolo corp and with two subsidiaries 
of olympia amp york developments ltd due to the bankruptcy filing 
friday 
the agreements require debartolo a major shopping mall 
developer and olympia amp york a real estate concern to refrain 
from taking any collateral they hold in campeau without giving nine 
days notice first the amendment ensures the agreements remain in 
effect despite the chapter 11 filing campeau said 
torontobased olympia amp york helped ease campeaus financial 
difficulties last year through a loan to the company on friday 
campeau said it will not pay interest due saturday on two bond 
issues and wants to defer the payments one of the issues worth 
260 million is owned by olympia amp york the second worth 184 
million canadian dollars is publicly traded 
federated and allied which operate 260 deparment stores in 28 
states filed for bankruptcy protection jan 15 listing 77 
billion in debt 
the federated group includes bloomingdales and abraham and 
straus both based in new york burdines of miami lazarus of 
cincinnati and richs of atlanta 
the allied group includes the bon marche of seattle jordan 
marsh of boston maas brothers of tampa and sterns of paramus 
nj 
campeau acquired allied in 1986 and federated in 1988 largely 
on the basis of borrowed money but federated and allied were 
unable to meet the interest payments on that debt forcing the 
bankruptcy filing

franklin savings association and the office 
of thrift supervision reached agreement friday on the issue of 
receivership after an almost twohour negotiating session among 
lawyers in federal court 
the agreement essentially gives franklin a chance to argue its 
case in court if the os decides to put the states largest thrift 
into receivership a receiver could liquidate all of franklins 
assets 
franklin and its holding company franklin savings corp 
withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction against ots and 
the kansas savings and loan department in us district court the 
injunction was designed to prevent appointment of a receiver until 
franklin has its day in court to contest the resolution trust 
corps conservatorship of the thrift 
the agreement outlined to judge dale saffels provides that no 
receiver will be appointed or substituted for the present 
conservator without giving notice to the court and to franklin 24 
hours in advance the agreement also requires the thrift office to 
justify to the court its reason for appointing a receiver if it 
attempts to do so 
earlier the ots only agreed to give franklin the advance notice 
franklin which was seized by the rtc on feb 16 believed the 
rtcs conservatorship was merely a prelude to a receivership once 
a receiver is appointed the court cant intervene 
the thrift said it will contest the validity of the 
conservatorship in a trial set to begin june 25 in saffels court 
here 
attorneys for franklin came prepared with exhibits to argue 
their case attorneys for ots said they also were prepared 
saffels however asked both parties to try to come to an agreement 
the negotiating session involved a call to washington dc to 
secure approval of the compromise by ots officials 
ots attorney paul w grace of washington said normally no notice 
is required for appointment of a receiver he would not say whether 
he was pleased or displeased with the agreement 
lets just say its a compromise both sides are willing to 
accept grace said 
ernest fleischer chairman of franklins holding company and on 
leave as chairman of the thrift said he was pleased with the 
agreement an attorney for franklin charles german said of the 
agreement its what we came for 
the justice department was present at the hearing to argue the 
constitutionality of the appointment of former ots director m 
danny wall who authorized franklins conservatorship however 
saffels said he was not willing to take up that issue which arose 
when a federal district judge in washington ruled last week that 
walls appointment was unconstitutional an appeals court later 
stayed that ruling pending its review of it 
franklin contends the thrift was not insolvent at the time it 
was taken over by federal regulators the thrift and the ots differ 
over the accounting principles used by franklin 
franklin through the president of its holding company john 
scowcroft claims it has a net worth of 387 million using 
generally accepted accounting principles 
the ots agrees with that figure but only as of dec 31 1989 
said spokeswoman cindy williams she said that figure likely would 
be down by next quarters report but could not release a monthly 
figure the thrift experienced a major writedown in its capital in 
march 
the thrift was hedging itself against swings in interest rates 
by using the futures market

fuel economy standards for 1992 light trucks will 
stay the same as for 1991 models the government said friday 
auto companies opposed tougher standards for 1992 saying people 
are buying larger trucks that bring average fuel economy down 
environmental groups had argued that the standard should be tougher 
the biggest thing we can do to curb global warming is to 
improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and light trucks said 
sierra club spokesman dan becker in washington dc 
the corporate average fuel economy standard for 1992 light 
trucks will be 202 miles per gallon the same as the 1991 cafe 
requirement and up from 20 mpg this year the national highway 
traffic safety administration said 
in addition to setting a cafe requirement for cars currently 
275 miles per gallon nhtsa annually sets a light truck standard 
applying to pickup trucks vans and utility vehicles that weigh up 
to 8500 pounds 
nhtsa decided manufacturers couldnt achieve significant 
improvements for 1992 through technological or marketing changes 
spokesman jim herd said 
ford motor co backed the lower requirement because larger 
trucks are selling faster than smaller more fuelefficient ones 
said david l kulp fords manager of fuel economy planning and 
compliance 
we felt that the market was going to hold us at this kind of 
level there are improvements being made in the trucks theyve 
just been offset by some of the shifts to the larger products 
kulp said 
general motors corp spokesman john anderson said the decision 
recognized that tighter standards could reduce trucks usefulness 
trucks have an enormous range of applications from towing to 
agricultural and construction uses he said 
the environmental action foundation argued on behalf of groups 
including the sierra club that standards should be raised to 35 
miles per gallon by 2000 said dru schmidtperkins environmental 
analyst for the group 
they are already 25 percent less efficient than cars 
schmidtperkins said and for the most part these are not farm 
vehicles and not commercial vans they are minivans and light 
pickup trucks which do nothing more than haul briefcases and 
groceries

coloradoute electric association 
losing a yearlong battle against financial disaster filed in us 
bankruptcy court in denver on friday for protection from creditors 
while it attempts to salvage itself 
the case is one of the largest utility bankruptcy filings in the 
country according to federal officials and threatens the 
longterm cost of power for consumers in much of colorado 
with 12 billion in debt coloradoute filed for chapter 11 
reorganization to stave off its many creditors while it tries to 
solve its problems 
coloradoute based in montrose in western colorado is owned by 
14 member rural electric coops and serves an estimated 600000 
customers 
the filing will have no effect on daytoday operations of the 
utility president ray keith said in a news release 
on march 31 1989 coloradoute defaulted on its loans blaming 
the oil shale bust for leaving the company with excess capacity 
however the bust was triggered by exxon corps pullout from the 
industry in 1982 and coloradoute not only pushed ahead with plant 
construction but also launched an expensive experimental power 
plant at nucla that still loses money 
coloradoute lost an estimated 15 million in 1989 
in its filing coloradoute listed liabilities of 9202 million 
and assets of 8883 million the documents do not reflect the 
companys 300 million lease obligation on its craig 3 power plant 
the company says the lease obligation is not a debt 
most of the liabilities are held by two federal lenders the 
us rural electrification administration and the national 
consolidated finance corp for a combined debt of more than 700 
million to the federal government 
other major creditors listed on the court filing were 
public service co of colorado 314 million of debt 
colowyo coal co 236 million for disputed coal royalties 
craig 3 lease trustee 118 million in current lease payments 
norwest bank of minneapolis united bank of denver and 
manufacturers hanover trust 10 million each 
in the year since coloradoute defaulted the company tried to 
merger with both public service co of colorado and tristate 
generation amp transmission co it also attempted to raise rates by 
237 percent 
public service co withdrew its offer last summer on march 8 
state regulators denied the big rate increase allowing only an 8 
percent hike tristate like coloradoute a generating company 
owned by its rural coops halted merger talks after the rate hike 
denial and then cut off coloradoutes access to a 40 million 
revolving loan 
with no access to cash and facing a monday deadline for a 15 
million interest payment to the rea the utility filed in 
bankruptcy court late friday afternoon
