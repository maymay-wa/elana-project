a member of the soviet communist partys 
central committee said there is a good chance the group will 
introduce laws at a party conference next month to limit the term 
of office for the general secretary according to a published 
report 
the washington post reports in tuesdays editions that while 
georgi arbatov said there was a good chance of such a change 
he added that the change would not indicate any setback for soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev who now holds the general secretary 
position 
the party conference in late june will occur after the moscow 
summit with president reagan which begins may 29 
arbatov told the newspaper that gorbachev and his propaganda 
chief alexander yakovlev had been in charge of crucial 
ideological issues in the party from the very beginning 
gorbachev had weathered a strong debate with the partys second 
in command yegor ligachev in the soviet press over his reform 
program arbatov said 
another highlevel soviet official valentin falin told the 
newspaper that reports that there would be major personnel shifts 
in the ruling politburo were untrue 
falin a nonvoting member of the committee said kremlin 
leadership had decided not to make any significant changes in top 
policymaking bodies 
falin also said gorbachev had recently learned a lot that is 
new to him about stalin from documents he has reviewed outlining 
crimes of the stalin era one document proves stalins role in 
preparing trumped up cases against his political enemies nikolai 
bukharin and lev kamenev falin said 
meanwhile other officials predicted the soviet leader would 
give an important speech on history highlighting the stalin era 
at the party conference

democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis wrapped up 
a california campaign swing sunday as his persistent rival jesse 
jackson pointedly told black students never surrender 
republican george bush meanwhile hung out the gone fishing 
sign 
jackson and dukakis were bracing for a primary battle on tuesday 
in oregon with 45 democratic delegates up for grabs a poll last 
month suggested dukakis was leading but jackson has campaigned 
hard in oregon drawing huge enthusiastic crowds 
jackson planned a final swing through the state on monday but 
dukakis was scheduled to devote the eve of the primary to taking 
care of gubernatorial business in massachusetts 
bush spent several hours sunday fishing from a raft on the rogue 
river in oregon with the secret service and a floating press corps 
for company he didnt catch any fish though 
the vice president was flying to seattle for an evening rally 
washington was the only state the vice president lost on super 
tuesday 
bushs sole remaining rival pat robertson who stayed in the 
race long after he fell from contention was poised to formally 
halt his bid on monday 
the vice president attained a mathematical lock on the 
nomination last month in the pennsylvania primary and picked up 
the endorsement of his boss president reagan last week robertson 
endorsed him too 
both dukakis and jackson were making brief stops sunday in new 
jersey which along with california holds a highstakes contest 
on june 7 the last day of the primary season 
i smell victory in the air an upbeat dukakis told a crowd 
at the new jersey democratic convention in south orange 
appearing before the same group jackson without naming 
dukakis criticized his rivals record as massachusetts governor 
and declared ive earned every vote ive gained 
the two met briefly before their new jersey appearances and 
dukakis described their exchange as warm pleasant respectful 
california with its primary prize of 314 democratic and 175 
republican delegates has been a frequent stumping ground for the 
presidential trio all three had appearances in the state last week 
dukakis who left california sunday after two days of 
campaigning got a lessthanfriendly reception on saturday from 
gay activists in los angeles the governor was grilled about his 
reluctance to allow homosexual couples to act as foster parents 
he planned to return to california later in the week as did 
jackson 
aides to dukakis are hoping the last big contests in california 
and new jersey will put dukakis over the top in terms of delegates 
according to the latest ap delegate count dukakis has 1610 to 
jacksons 956 of 2081 needed to nominate 
dukakis refuses to discount jacksons continuing candidacy but 
his talk has focused more and more on an expected confrontation 
with bush in november 
i think the fact that in these early matchups between me and 
the vice president the fact that i am leading at least gives you 
some sense that this is doable dukakis said over the 
weekend referring to polls suggesting that he could beat bush in 
the fall 
jackson was in hampton va on sunday giving a graduation 
address at predominantly black hampton university his 61yearold 
motherinlaw gertrude brown was receiving her degree in social 
work at the ceremony 
jackson who has pushed ahead with his campaign despite a string 
of losses to dukakis cited mrs brown as someone who has overcome 
obstacles and succeeded 
she is of strong character and she never surrendered said 
jackson who told of his motherinlaws struggle to raise five 
children while working full time three of those children he said 
went on to receive advanced degrees 
when her last child left home mrs brown returned to get her 
high school diploma at age 49 over the next 12 years she 
completed her college education 
against all odds she is graduating today that is what 
this graduation is all about jackson said never surrender 
he told the students that if elected he would double federal 
spending on education

public fear of nuclear power and 
unexpected criticism from the press suddenly have made soviet 
officials strikingly defensive about their efforts to deal with the 
effects of the chernobyl disaster 
comments by some officials during a conference on the medical 
effects of the accident and a tour of the mammoth chernobyl nuclear 
power plant last week suggested they are worried that public 
opposition could halt development of nuclear power in the soviet 
union 
the april 26 1986 explosion and fire at the chernobyl plants 
no 4 reactor killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of 
radioactive material that eventually circled the globe 
the soviets were severely criticized in the west for not 
immediately reporting the accident since then they have opened an 
international media center at chernobyl given more than 180 tours 
of the plant and made other efforts to provide information about 
their efforts to clean up after the accident 
but even before getting down to the main work of their threeday 
conference in kiev officials several times cited evidence of what 
they called radiophobia or an unreasonable fear of nuclear 
power among soviet citizens 
alexander kovalenko chief spokesman for kombinat a staterun 
organization that oversees the chernobyl plant and the 18mile 
exclusion zone around it said the public conception of the 
accident was not less important than the technical problems 
soviet specialists acknowledged that rumors of radioactive leaks 
at chernobyl still sweep kiev the capital of the soviet ukraine 
80 miles south of the plant 
they said some people are afraid to have children because they 
fear birth defects induced by radiation stress and stressrelated 
medical problems linked to the disaster are on the rise 
leonid ilyin head of the soviet institute of biophysics 
described radiophobia as a psychological and political problem 
that could damage the future of nuclear power rejection of nuclear 
power is a lack of understanding of the reality of today when 
there is no alternative he said 
the soviet media have reported that public opposition has halted 
construction of nuclear power plants near the southern ukrainian 
city of odessa the byelorussian capital of minsk and the southern 
russian city of krasnodar 
such action is extremely rare in a country where the only 
protests for years have been conducted only by small bands of 
dissenters 
despite the chernobyl accident the soviet union has committed 
itself to an ambitious nuclear power program last april andranik 
petrosyants head of the soviet atomic energy commission said the 
country planned to double the amount of electricity produced by 
nuclear power between 1985 and 1990 
the soviets stressed that except for those who were treated for 
radiation sickness immediately after the chernobyl accident they 
have found no medical effects of the fire 
they criticized american doctor robert gale and others who 
publicize estimates of the possible number of cancer deaths from 
the chernobyl accident 
gale retorted that with the lack of such information provided by 
soviet scientists many people in kiev worry about what will 
happen to them 
cancers caused by exposure to radiation from the plant could 
take decades to form doctors said 
kovalenko and chernobyl plant manager mikhail umanets also were 
stung by sharp criticism from an unexpected source the official 
soviet media 
the communist party newspaper pravda on april 24 complained of 
shoddy work drunkenness and nepotism at the chernobyl plant 
umanets said in a meeting with reporters at the chernobyl plant 
that some of the criticisms were justified of kombinat in general 
but not of workers at the chernobyl plant 
kovalenko said he considered the pravda article extremely 
harmful but would use it to clear up misconceptions the papers 
article cannot be considered a statement backed by the 
policymaking central committee of the soviet communist party he 
said 
on a tour of the chernobyl plant and its surroundings officials 
used radiation counters to stress to reporters that radiation 
levels were not dangerous for the relatively brief periods for 
which workers now are exposed 
kovalenko said 400 workers are housed for two weeks at a time in 
pripyat about a mile from the chernobyl plant the city of almost 
50000 where plant workers once lived in large apartment blocks was 
hurriedly evacuated 36 hours after the accident and has not been 
resettled 
kovalenko said officials also have allowed as many as 500 
elderly people who once lived inside the exclusion zone to return 
even though it technically is illegal 
they face no danger he said

when president reagan assumed office 
nearly eight years ago the united states took renewed interest in

there was a leftist government in nicaragua a strong

a series of american administrations paid little attention to

the 197879 war waged by the sandinistas against then president 
anastasio somoza returned central america to the spotlight it was 
capped by the sandinistas triumphant march into managua on july

proamerican somoza dynasty 
less than two years later the cia claiming the sandinistas 
were hardened marxists exporting revolution to el salvador began 
training and supplying a group of rebels known today as the contras 
the 1981 cutoff of us aid and the 1985 trade embargo failed to 
bring the sandinista government to its knees millions of dollars 
some covert and some congressionally approved were provided to 
the contras yet they were unable to defeat the sovietsupplied 
sandinistas 
pushed by last summers regional peace plan the sandinistas 
signed a historic ceasefire pact with the contra leadership on 
march 23 a fragile truce remains in place but the two sides can 
agree on little else than a desire to the war that has claimed

american troops to train the unskilled salvadoran military but a

bud clark portlands exuberant 
barkeepturnedmayor expects to defy political odds once more by 
winning reelection despite a stormy first term 
clark shocked the city four years ago when he stepped out of his 
goose hollow inn and mounted a grassroots campaign to unseat 
incumbent frank ivancie who had dismissed the newcomers chances 
in his first two years in office however clark faced a series 
of crises mostly involving the city police bureau two police 
chiefs resigned and clark fired a third 
clark survived a recall attempt and so far has weathered 
lawsuits filed by his most famous appointee penny harrington who 
resigned 16 months after he made her the first female bigcity 
police chief in the united states 
the last two years have been quieter and clark seems to have 
regained public support 
recent polls including one published sunday show he holds a 
32point lead over the nearest of 10 challengers in the 
nonpartisan race sundays poll showed him holding 51 percent of 
the vote with a 49 percent margin of error his campaign now is 
focusing on getting over 50 percent in tuesdays primary to avoid a 
november runoff 
hes wellliked concedes one of his challengers former 
city commissioner lloyd anderson on a personal basis people 
think he is a decent human being thats combined with a feeling by 
many who think hes not doing a good job as mayor that he could be 
stronger from an administrative standpoint 
those running against him for whatever reasons have not made 
as effective a case as theyd hoped for that the two ought to be 
separated anderson says 
clark 57 with his full gray beard bulbous nose and twinkling 
eyes looks like santa claus and is nearly as identifiable to 
portlanders hes a selfdescribed populist who enjoys being among 
his constituents and often can be seen riding his bicycle about 
town or poling his canoe down portlands willamette river 
i wouldnt be surprised if he were reelected in the 
primary city commissioner dick bogle says people are going to 
go into that booth and see that name and the image theyre going 
to get is that beard and that twinkle and theyre going to punch 
that hole 
the jovial mayor also is known for some mild eccentricities 
including his trademark cry of whoop whoop at civic functions 
and his everpresent camera which he uses to chronicle his mayoral 
career 
back in his barkeeping days he still owns a bar but doesnt 
run it anymore he also was known for posing for a humorous 
poster headlined expose yourself to art that gained 
popularity on college campuses nationwide 
clarks accomplishments as mayor have been varied 
he was instrumental in getting voters to approve a threecounty 
bond measure for a convention center that officials hope will 
revitalize the citys inner east side 
an ambitious plan to help the citys homeless has had mixed 
success it increased the number of shelter spaces but the 
homeless population remains large and is still a source of friction 
for downtown businesses and workers 
but clark is credited with getting city council members to work 
together increasing citizen involvement in city government and 
improving police relations with city neighborhoods 
crime is another matter portland has so little jail space that 
suspected burglars and car thieves are given tickets and released 
the issue has dominated the campaign yet clarks opponents 
including two of his former police chiefs so far have been unable 
to capitalize on it 
candidate ron still who retired as police chief shortly after 
clark took office cites clarks cuts in police bureau drug and 
vice squads early in his term and the increase in drug trafficking 
and gang activity that followed 
the public image of portland is its a good place to come 
because even if you do a crime you arent going to go to jail much 
of this is his fault still says 
clark admits crime and the police problems have been his 
greatest frustrations he says fighting crime and drug abuse are 
his top priorities for the next four years 
the credibility of the justice system in this city is very 
bad clark says its not my responsibility directly but i 
look at it as ive got to make this system work because weve got 
to get this crime turned around 
although clark has been criticized for his antics in office 
there have been few attacks on his personality during the campaign 
candidate jim davis whom clark fired as police chief in an 
argument over a bureau audit was booed when he made such an attack 
at a recent candidates forum 
clark claims hes one of many famous mayors who have used 
certain antics in drawing attention to their city 
having certain differences gives personality to your city and 
makes it realize that youre a human being too he says 
surveys indicate clarks popularity stems from his carefully 
maintained image as a nonpolitician an outsider without a big 
political ego 
im here strictly for bettering my city im not here to make 
a big name for myself he says i dont have any political 
plans beyond this ill do four more years and then im going to 
quit

a latebreaking series of dramatic events in the 
final days of the french presidential election promised to boost 
thenpremier jacques chiracs chances for an upset victory 
it wasnt enough but there is evidence the governments 
coups did at least improve chiracs losing score 
in a 48hour span chiracs conservative government welcomed 
home three hostages from lebanon attacked a rebel cave hideout in 
new caledonia to rescue 23 other hostages while killing 19 
separatists and flew a french secret agent home from her pacific 
island exile 
suddenly people in cafes were asking if chirac who had been 
trailing far behind in polls might win after all a previously 
despondent chirac campaign staff regained hope 
but when the results were counted may 8 socialist president 
francois mitterrand waltzed to reelection with 54 percent of the 
vote to chiracs 46 percent 
because french law makes it illegal to publish polls in the last 
week before an election it is difficult to be certain what effect 
the latebreaking news had on voters decision beyond saying it 
was not enough to sway the election 
the final public polls taken immediately after the april 24 
firstround vote that eliminated all candidates except mitterrand 
and chirac found the president leading with from 53 percent to 57 
percent of the vote which was not far from the final result 
all these efforts concentrated miraculously in one little week 
were not enough edwy plenel and georges marion commented in a 
doublebylined article in the leftleaning daily le monde 
the coups did not pay off at best in a zerosum game they 
did not change the tendency at worst the bloodshed obscured the 
lives saved and the gap was widened 
patrice desaubliaux writing in the conservative newspaper le 
figaro came to almost the same conclusion the events that 
occurred between the two rounds do not seem to have had the 
slightest effect 
but there is other evidence suggesting there was at least some 
impact on voters in the final days 
there were reports that the chirac campaigns private tracking 
polls showed the premier gaining more than a percentage point on 
may 5 when news of the twin hostage liberations was published 
but falling back to his previous level in the next two days 
a survey of voters as they left the polls done for the 
newspaper le parisien and the magazine levenement du jeudi found 
that 8 percent of chiracs voters made up their minds in the final 
days of the campaign compared with just 4 percent of those who 
voted for mitterrand 
the same poll found that 13 percent of those questioned said the 
release of the french hostages in lebanon affected their vote 
while 41 percent said it did not change their decision and the rest 
would not respond 
among chirac voters the hostage release made a difference for 
21 percent but it was cited by only 7 percent of those who chose 
mitterrand 
similarly the exit poll found the operation to rescue the 22 
police and one assistant prosecutor held captive in new caledonia 
was an element in the decision of 14 percent of all french voters 
but 22 percent of chiracs voters said the operation had an effect 
compared with only 8 percent of mitterrand supporters 
the preelection drama began may 4 when chirac announced to a 
campaign rally that the last three french hostages held by shiite 
moslem extremists in lebanon had just been freed 
chirac was the first to shake the hands of magazine writer 
jeanpaul kauffmann and diplomats marcel carton and marcel fontaine 
when they stepped off the plane in paris the next day 
as they were flying home chirac ordered an attack on melanesian 
separatists who had been holding 23 hostages in a remote island 
cave all were freed unharmed while 19 of the new caledonian 
captors were killed 
then on may 6 the government announced that dominique prieur 
convicted of manslaughter in the sabotage of the protest ship 
rainbow warrior but considered a heroine by many in france was 
being flown home early from a pacific atoll because she was 
pregnant 
the new zealand government denounced mrs prieurs return as a 
violation of the agreement under which she had been allowed to 
leave prison 
all three events were credited to chirac who as premier 
controlled the governments daytoday business 
as president mitterrands role is more detached and he was not 
expected to reap much benefit from the events which were popular 
beyond the ranks of chirac supporters 
mitterrands aides said chirac dutifully kept the president 
informed of the governments actions in the closing days of the 
campaign

china has 670000 beggars and many have turned 
to begging as an easy way to make money an official newspaper said 
today 
the china daily said the nations first conference on the 
homeless which ended in beijing last week concluded that beggars 
pose a hazard to social order and should rouse wide concern 
the daily and other news reports said the number of beggars at 
the end of 1987 was down from 105 million in 1979 but that there 
has been a rise in professional beggars seeking money rather 
than food 
it said only 20 percent of those who beg do so because of 
natural disasters or personal misfortunes most turn to begging for 
the money while others have mental problems or are runaways 
escaping arranged marriages

us experts on the soviet union expect little 
from the moscow summit and are looking beyond it to an early summer 
communist party conference which by all accounts will be a 
watershed in soviet politics 
mikhail s gorbachev appears likely to survive for at least a 
couple more years as the partys general secretary but he has 
failed to gain full control of the policymaking central committee 
the 300plus member body that so far has stymied his farreaching 
reform efforts according to the experts 
they view the summit primarily as part of gorbachevs effort to 
cement his control 
gorbachevs reforms so far have not improved soviet living 
standards according to western dispatches from moscow and a recent 
analysis by the central intelligence agency 
his biggest success has been in the foreign policy arena 
improving the image of the soviet union around the world by 
improving relations with the united states by making arms control 
proposals and by agreeing to withdraw the red army from afghanistan 
he can brighten his own image further at home and abroad by 
playing host in the kremlin to a smiling ronald reagan who built a 
career on anticommunism and who began his presidency by branding 
the soviet union the evil empire 
probably the most important thing gorbachev needs is the 
symbolism of having ronald reagan in moscow said marshall 
shulman a columbia university lecturer and a top carter 
administration expert on soviet affairs 
american and soviet officials have lowered public expectations 
for the summit as the senate delayed ratification of an arms 
control treaty signed last december and us and soviet negotiators 
remain far apart on a proposed pact to sharply cut strategic 
arsenals 
but said a senior government analyst who spoke on condition of 
anonymity both parties want to see the summit come off smoothly 
they dont want any embarrassments they have made progress in the 
relationship 
shulman agreed that a successful symbolic summit would be 
useful for gorbachev but it would not solve his problems his 
basic problems are rooted in the domestic economy 
a summit marred by disagreements on the other hand could 
weaken gorbachevs case at home said the senior us government 
analyst 
the ferment in the soviet leadership is as great as at any 
time since the 1920s said the government expert but this 
will not be played out at the summit we wont see much disarray 
there 
gorbachev and his chief rival on the ruling politburo yegor 
ligachev are expected to maintain their harmonious front at least 
through the summit said the analyst 
that is unless gorbachev manages to ease ligachev from the 
powerful party secretariat into the largely ceremonial post of 
president now held by andrei gromyko another politburo member 
thought to be wary of sweeping reforms 
under this scenario which could be played out at meetings of 
the central committee and the supreme soviet expected the week 
before the may 29june 2 summit ligachev would probably remain in 
the politburo but gromyko would not 
however the central committee has been a thorn in gorbachevs 
side and may balk at leadership changes until he can gain greater 
control over it 
at the most recent party congress in early 1987 gorbachev 
replaced about 40 percent of the central committee but needs to 
fill another 15 to 20 percent of the seats with his people for a 
comfortable majority said shulman 
the party conference is his chance to do that 
some of the 5000 or so conference delegates have been selected 
by local and regional communist party bodies and gorbachev has 
started trying to unselect those he believes will oppose him 
said shulman 
since gorbachev rose to power in march 1985 the central 
committee has balked at some his most radical ideas such as 
limiting the tenure of party officials having secret ballots and 
allowing more than one candidate for elections 
gorbachev wants to push those through and persuade the committee 
to accept his view on what the soviets call the question of 
questions what the role of the party will be said shulman just 
back from moscow 
gorbachev agreed the senior government analyst would like 
the party out of the details he wants the party to have 
macrovision not to micromanage 
gorbachevs vision as perceived by shulman and the government 
analyst is for the communist party whose members now make up 10 
percent of the population to set broad policy and exercise 
general control over the country 
the central committee many of whose members are the 
middlelevel managers whose role gorbachev seeks to reduce so far 
have balked at surrendering the partys minutebyminute control 
over all soviet institutions

lifelong dream

this graduation is all about he said

pat robertson the former television 
evangelist who failed to turn the fervent support of his 
invisible army into a significant share of republican votes 
was formally ending his presidential bid today 
at the outset of the 1988 presidential race robertson was a 
wild card 
the republican establishment nervously eyed his evangelical 
followers and his hefty warchest and wondered what kind of a 
showing he might make since many robertson supporters were new to 
the political process his potential impact was difficult to gauge 
in the end robertson spent 22 million and gained only 46 
delegates to the republican national convention 
robertson set the stage for his departure last week by endorsing 
the republican nomineetobe george bush who already has a 
mathematical lock on the nomination 
he was holding a press conference today at his home to make 
official what has been clear to observers for months that 
robertson is not in contention for the republican presidential 
nomination 
the former television evangelist was expected to hang onto his 
delegates until the convention then release them to bush on the 
first ballot 
the high point of the robertson campaign came early on the 
feb 8 iowa caucuses where he beat out bush for second place 
behind kansas sen bob dole 
but in the next big battle the new hampshire primary 
robertson finished behind not only bush and dole but also behind 
new york rep jack kemp and former delaware gov pete du pont 
even then robertson gave every indication that he expected to 
make a comeback in the south with its march 8 megaprimary 
ladies and gentlemen he told his supporters after the 
disappointing showing in new hampshire tomorrow i go into the 
south and then we are going to be playing in my own backyard 
his backyard proved an unfriendly place in the southern 
primaries he finished no better than second place in texas and 
was third in his home state of virginia 
robertson continued to do well in the caucus states winning in 
hawaii nevada washington and alaska and doing well in minnesota 
and alaska 
but by midmarch robertson was no longer even competing in 
states with primaries he concentrated his scaleddown campaign on 
the caucuses started talking about 1992 and about making his mark 
at the republican national convention in new orleans this summer 
i am the true conservative candidate and i will bring that 
voice to the convention he said robertson said he hoped to 
shape the partys platform bringing it in line with his 
conservative views 
i want a platform like the 1984 platform for school prayer 
against abortion for family values he said 
the robertson campaign was not without its otherworldly moments 
on easter sunday robertson told a denver congregation his 
presidential bid was divinely inspired 
there is an enterprise the lord set me on a year or so ago 
running for president he said and it wasnt over yet he told 
the faithful 
out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a foundation 
for a great victory for this nation it may not be in 1988 but 
i am not going to quit that is his plan for me and for this 
nation robertson said 
other signposts on the robertson campaign trail 
he sued former rep paul mccloskey for libel when mccloskey 
said robertson used the influence of his father then a us 
senator from virginia to avoid combat in the korean war after 
some messy preliminaries robertson dropped the suit because it was 
to go to trial on super tuesday he was ordered to pay court costs 
he contended it was unfair and bigoted to describe him as a 
former television evangelist although that was how he became 
famous he said cable businessman or religious broadcaster would be 
more accurate 
his claim in a new hampshire debate that there were nuclear 
missiles in cuba aimed at this country robertson later said he had 
no firsthand information but insisted that nobody really 
knows the contention was denied by the white house the joint 
chiefs of staff and others 
his charges that planned parenthood founder margaret sanger 
wanted to sterilize blacks jews mental defectives and 
fundamentalist christians planned parenthood officials dismissed 
the allegation scholars who have studied sangers writings said 
there was no basis for the claim 
robertsons claim that the state department chose to ignore 
intelligence gathered by his christian broadcasting network people 
in beirut on the location of some american hostages the former cbn 
bureau chief in beirut later said he had no such information 
and statements that one can get aids through casual contact 
contradicting medical experts findings on the subject he also 
advocated shooting down airplanes suspected of carrying drugs into 
the country 
robertson has said he will return to the television network he 
founded nearly 30 years ago to help shore up its financial 
position since robertson left cbn to campaign donations have 
fallen dramatically and several hundred workers have been laid off 
robertson also promised to form a political action committee to 
train and fund conservative christian political candidates

former white house chief of staff donald t 
regan who says he can take it as well as dish it out gets a 
chance to prove it one week after taking literary swipes at the 
president and first lady nancy reagan 
in a book coming out this week onetime presidential domestic 
policy adviser martin anderson pictures regan as a cocksure aide 
following his own impulses apparently unaware of the potential 
cost to president reagan 
andersons isnt the only counterpunch thrown at regan whose 
book for the record depicts the president as a hesitant 
decisionmaker and says the first lady meddled in white house 
affairs often on the basis of astrological advice 
david m abshire a special white house counselor during the 
irancontra crisis writes in the washington post that regan 
often seemed more concerned with his own welfare how he would 
come out than with the presidents 
both regans book which came out last week and andersons are 
published by harcourt brace jovanovich 
on the cbs television program face the nation sunday regan 
said i think i have been very fair and very honest 
of the ensuing criticism he said sure they have to hurt 
somewhat but look im a big boy ive been around and i knew 
this was coming so im prepared to take it 
anderson who interviewed regan among others in preparation for 
his book revolution discusses the former chief of staffs 
decision in october 1985 to disband a group of government economic 
advisers 
the group the presidents economic policy advisory board of 
which anderson became a member after leaving the white house in 
1982 met with the president four times a year regan after moving 
to the white house from his previous post as secretary of the 
treasury refused to renew the executive order creating it 
as chief of staff with unprecedented power delegated to him 
by president reagan regan evidently decided to tidy up the policy 
advisory structure anderson wrote in his book and nobody 
outside a small group in the inner upper reaches of the white 
house knew it probably not even president reagan 
it was a small incident but it revealed something about donald 
regans character such a strong degree of assurance and 
selfconfidence in his own judgment that he unhesitatingly 
followed his impulse apparently unaware of the potential cost to 
president reagan it was a hint of a character flaw that would be 
deepened and widened by the decisions forced upon him in the months 
that followed a flaw that perhaps helped plunge president reagan 
into the abyss of the irancontra affair within a year 
in february 1987 the presidentially appointed tower commission 
said that regan must bear primary responsibility for the chaos 
that descended on the white house after the revelations of secret 
arms sales to iran and diversion of funds to nicaraguan rebels 
at this time abshire wrote in an article published sunday in 
the post he called on regan and recommended that he step out 
now rather than be pushed out and that he write a book on 
the high ground about the genuine dilemmas of government and the 
white house 
he took neither the advice to leave earlier nor to write a 
highminded book said abshire he went out not with dignity 
but as he said like a shoe clerk 
regan in his book wrote that his dismissal as chief of staff 
was the bitterest event of my life and destroyed my 
friendship with the president to whom i had devoted six years of 
loyal and as it seemed to me unselfish service 
asked sunday if he had made mistakes in his relations with mrs 
reagan regan said to the extent that she wants yesmen around 
her i was not a yesman and that was a mistake 
abshire however wrote that mrs reagan while the president 
was convalescing from prostate surgery early in 1987 did exactly 
the opposite of mrs woodrow wilson who cut off access to 
president wilson after he suffered a stroke 
nancy reagan encouraged me to speak up and tell the president 
frankly about the problems that faced his presidency the former 
counselor wrote my dealings with the first lady impressed me 
first that she is a political realist and second that she does 
not dominate this strongminded president

george bush was an 11thhour choice by ronald 
reagan in 1980 lyndon johnson was written off as a potential 
running mate for john f kennedy in 1960 spiro agnew was unknown 
until richard nixon tapped him in 1968 and bob dole was at the top 
of nobodys list in 1976 except gerald fords 
when it comes to picking running mates history indicates the 
nominees may turn to someone the handicappers considered a long 
shot or didnt consider at all 
the conventional wisdom has it that democrat michael dukakis 
would have to choose a southerner as his vice presidential running 
mate and republican george bush must choose a conservative as his 
second but there are a dozen possible choices that fit neither 
bill 
here is a rundown of the names most often mentioned in both 
parties starting with the democrats 
jesse jackson hell enter the democratic convention in july 
with the second largest bloc of delegates and the allegiance of 
millions of black voters former president jimmy carter calls 
jackson amazingly attractive but many party leaders consider 
jackson too controversial and likely to hurt the ticket party 
chairman paul g kirk jr points out that only once since the turn 
of the century has a presidential nominee offered a place on the 
ticket to his leading rival if i were to finish second it 
wouldnt entitle me to anything more than consideration period 
dukakis said 
sam nunn a favorite of fellow southerners the georgian is 
chairman of the senate armed services committee and perceived by 
supporters as blunting republican criticism that the democrats are 
antidefense nunns conservative voting record on domestic issues 
and opposition to some civil rights legislation and the equal 
rights amendment generate opposition among liberals 
bob graham a popular former governor of florida graham is in 
his first senate term his limited service in congress works 
against him if dukakis is looking for someone to balance his own 
lack of washington experience but if he brings 21 southern 
electoral votes who needs washington experience 
lloyd bentsen with 29 electoral votes texas is an even bigger 
southern prize than florida and one that has often been critical to 
democratic victories i have no interest in it says the 
senator more important is the question of whether bentsen could 
deliver the state bush most often calls home 
dale bumpers the arkansas senator is one of the partys best 
speakers and sounds unmistakably southern even though his voting 
record makes him a favorite of liberals bumpers has 13 years of 
experience in congress but can he help dukakis anywhere other than 
arkansas which has only six electoral votes 
albert gore jr gore a tennessee senator carried primaries 
in four southern states as well as his home state proving his 
popularity in the pivotal region and he also holds acceptable 
credentials in defense and foreign policy but he took some nasty 
shots at dukakis during the primary campaign 
john glenn a glenn boomlet developed when antinunn democrats 
looked around for somebody with strong defense credentials but a 
more liberal record on domestic issues glenn an ohio senator 
still is revered by many as the former marine colonel who was the 
first american to orbit earth on the down side is his disastrous 
1984 presidential campaign and the fact he comes from a state that 
dukakis ought to be able to carry without him 
on the republican side bush has the advantage of waiting until 
dukakis makes his choice here are some of the gop prospects 
george deukmejian if he could give bush a lock on californias 
47 electoral votes the richest prize in the nation deukmejian 
would be a tempting choice but the governor and many of his fellow 
californians are worried that he would be succeeded in sacramento 
by a democrat if elected vice president 
jack kemp he was a conservative favorite in the race for the 
presidential nomination but failed to show an ability to get 
votes his biggest plus would be if bush felt he needed to make a 
gesture to the partys right wing kemp is a new york congressman 
but bush needs more than buffalo to carry the state 
lamar alexander the former tennessee governor won praise for 
innovative programs that improved tennessees schools during his 
two terms as governor bush is known to consult alexander on 
education issues he has the ability to appeal to both moderates 
and conservatives 
bob dole an unlikely choice after a campaign in which he 
repeatedly belittled bushs credentials but the kansas senator is 
strongest where bush is weakest in the farm belt bush choosing 
dole would be on a par with kennedy choosing johnson 
elizabeth dole a far more likely choice than her husband an 
appealing campaigner from north carolina she helps bush among 
women voters a group where pollsters say he is weakest mrs dole 
the former transportation secretary also is a favorite of sen 
jesse helms of north carolina which scores a lot of points with 
conservatives detractors blame her for chaos in the airline 
industry her husband could prove another negative 
james thompson as governor of illinois thompson has bigstate 
credentials but during 12 years as governor he has made enough 
enemies that polls suggest he might not be able to deliver his 
state 
the westerners colorado sen william armstrong former nevada 
sen paul laxalt and interior secretary donald hodel long shots 
all not a big batch of electoral votes among them and if bush 
needs them to carry their states hes probably not going to become 
president 
the moderates white house chief of staff howard baker new 
jersey gov thomas kean and kansas sen nancy kassebaum are out of 
step with the republican party of ronald reagan one of the most 
popular politicians in the history of new jersey kean would 
probably trigger a conservative revolt if put on the ticket 
conservatives still resent baker for his role in passage of the 
panama canal treaty kassebaums voting record is one of the most 
liberal of any republican in congress

president reagan is always looking for good 
news and if the experts are right theres a sunny way of assessing 
the disclosures in donald regans book 
according to historians and political scientists reagan has not 
been damaged much by the former aides revelation about astrology 
at the white house and his portrayal of reagan as an outoftouch 
leader who merely followed a script from his staff 
on the other hand they say the reason the latest disclosures 
havent hurt him is that reagan already had been devastated by the 
irancontra affair and couldnt be hurt much more 
lucky for reagan that all of this is coming out at the end of 
his presidency instead of at the beginning 
imagine how a new president would be weakened and ridiculed when 
the world learned that an astrologer commissioned by his wife 
played a role in white house affairs 
virtually every move and decision the reagans made during my 
time as white house chief of staff was cleared in advance by a 
woman in san francisco who drew up horoscopes to make certain that 
the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise 
wrote regan who was the presidents chief of staff until he was 
ousted with a push from the first lady 
regan also documented that the president issued no orders but 
listened acquiesced played his role and waited for the next act 
to be written 
embarrassing as those stories are they come at the end of 
reagans administration when he doesnt have much of an agenda 
left to push and his reputation has been established 
the world leaders who are his friends probably wont pay much 
attention to the latest news and his enemies already had a 
negative view of him anyway 
tom griscom the white house chief of communications brushes 
aside suggestions that regans book for the record has 
wounded the president 
i dont think it really matters one way or the other 
griscom said i think this president has had a tremendous impact 
on the policies of this country i think nobody will be able to 
take that away from him its there 
moreover griscom believes it will not spoil reagans summit 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in moscow may 29june 2 
harvard university historian adam ulam agrees i dont think 
they pay any attention to it why should they ulam said i 
think that they deal with facts they dont deal with gossip 
duke university political scientist and author james david 
barber said i dont know that this disclosure is really going 
to sustain itself very long reagan has this talent for joking 
these things off 
however barber said reagans personal credibility in 
international affairs regarding his relations with informed chiefs 
of state has been wiped out for a long time because of the 
revelation that he was secretly sending weapons to iran while 
publicly vowing that the united states would not deal with 
terrorists 
i dont think its likely that gorbachev is naive about if 
you hear something out of the mouth of this ronald reagan 
therefore you can put your money on the table barber said 
more important than the news about astrology barber said is 
the picture of reagan as president barber said it showed reagan as 
a smiling loafer like harding or taft 
political scientist theodore lowi of cornell university said 
that presidents as heads of state dont lose their credibility 
all that fast in the eyes of world leaders 
he said the impact of regans disclosures was minuscule if at 
all 
the biggest effect on reagans presidency has already happened 
which is the irancontra affair lowi said its still 
happening the second biggest one is the ed meese affair 
the effect has been quite damaging it damages the credibility 
in a very fundamental ethical sense the irancontra affair 
primarily and meeses troubles being substantial but of secondary 
importance 
meese the attorney general is under investigation for several 
matters and there have been highlevel justice department 
resignations by officials who say meeses problems have undermined 
the agencys effectiveness 
discounting the impact of regans book lowi said the president 
has handled it extremely well a bit of humor a light touch and 
a bit of injured indignation this is the sort of thing where 
reagan is supremely capable

within days of the attack on the uss stark 
iraq accepted responsibility for what it called a case of mistaken 
identity and pledged to compensate the victims and navy 
administration officials who ask not to be identified say it 
could be years however before any money changes hands 
last month after notifying the families of the 37 men killed 
the united states presented iraq with a claim for wrongful death in 
each case the amount of each claim varied depending on the 
expected lifetime earnings and other actuarial information for each 
victim 
a state department source said the united states had been 
working on presentation of those claims to iraq for months the 
official declined to give the total dollar figure but said it was 
in the tens of millions 
there has been no response from the iraqis 
still to be determined is the size of the claim the united 
states will submit for the damage to the stark itself the navy 
decided to perform an overhaul on the stark as long as it was going 
into drydock and now must figure the precise cost of the battle 
damage repairs 
the state department official estimated it would take another 
six months before that claim is figured and forwarded to the iraqis 
the source refused to speculate on how long it would take for 
money to change hands citing the case of the uss liberty 
that ship was attacked by israel during the 1967 middle east 
war the final claim for damages was not paid until 1980 despite 
the close ties between the united states and israel 
in the case of iraq the sources predicted long negotiations 
would be necessary to resolve the matter in part because iraq will 
probably try to avoid setting any precedent that could be used by 
merchant ships it has attacked over the years

as michael dukakis tightens his grip on the 
democratic presidential nomination party leaders are moving 
increasingly to join his camp few however are throwing their 
support these days to jesse jackson 
in the weeks since his makeorbreak victory in the wisconsin 
primary the massachusetts governor has picked up support from 69 
of the partys super delegates while jackson has gained just 
six according to a survey by the associated press 
in all dukakis has 1610 delegates to the democratic national 
convention of whom 203 are super delegates the 643 party leaders 
and politicians whose titles won them seats as delegates dukakis 
is now more than threequarters of the way to the 2081 delegates 
needed to win the partys presidential nomination 
it follows success with the voters said tad devine 
director of delegate selection for the dukakis campaign it all 
began in wisconsin 
jackson has 956 delegates overall 52 of whom are super 
delegates another 331 super delegates are uncommitted 
jackson has complained that super delegates who are free to 
support whomever they choose are not following the will of the 
voters and that dukakis is receiving more than his fair share 
but iowa party chairwoman bonnie campbell who recently 
announced her support for dukakis said jacksons complaint is 
unfounded 
reverend jackson or his people were in on the decisionmaking 
process that led to rules governing the entire nominating 
procedure ms campbell said he in fact signed off on the 
rules therefore hes somewhat foreclosed from complaining 
dukakis who had been stung in jacksons landslide victory in 
michigan on march 26 came back to win the wisconsin primary 10 
days later and went on to win the primaries in new york 
pennsylvania ohio indiana nebraska and west virginia 
although the super delegates are not required to declare their 
allegiance to any presidential candidate some are being drawn to 
the dukakis campaign as if by the force of gravity caused by his 
string of victories and his wide lead in the delegate count 
its a twoperson race and i dont think its going to be 
close said robert dryfoos a new york super delegate who 
recently came out in support of dukakis 
there was a time it was a very tight race dryfoos said 
now mike dukakis is clearly comfortably and overwhelmingly ahead 
of jesse jackson as they get to the nomination hes going to be 
the nominee 
the dukakis campaign has put considerable organization and 
effort into courting both the super delegates and those who were 
pledged to candidates who have quit campaigning 
sue pate an uncommitted delegate from texas said she has been 
impressed by the contact shes had with the dukakis campaign 
theyve really been doing their homework she said they 
call me every second they are not abusive they are friendly and 
helpful 
winberg chai who was picked as a south dakota delegate 
supporting missouri rep richard gephardt said he planned to 
support jackson after gephardt dropped out 
but the jackson campaign contacted him only once and did not 
send any of the candidates position papers chai said he has 
switched to dukakis 
some delegates have been falling away from sens paul simon of 
illinois and albert gore jr of tennessee both of whom put their 
presidential campaigns on hold 
gore now has 32 super delegates a decline of 17 in recent 
weeks and simon has 22 a drop of seven overall gore has 403 
delegates and simon has 174 according to the ap delegate count

outgoing education secretary william j 
bennett says i know that im popular and if there is a 
political race in his future it will be for the white house 
such an effort may be years away bennett said in an interview 
but after watching some of the people in the stakes for the 
presidency i could do that well 
i wont mention anybody in particular the outspoken 
educator said but he added that he was referring to both 
republicans and democrats 
he brought up the white house himself when asked if he aspired 
to run for the senate 
bennett said he has had overtures about possible senate races 
from his native state of new york his adopted state of north 
carolina and from maryland where he now lives 
but he said neither the senate nor the possibility of a college 
presidency holds any interest for him 
right now if i were going to run for anything in the future 
id want to run for president he volunteered 
asked about the vice presidency bennett said im not sure 
id make a very good no 2 man i like to run things 
vice president george bush who has locked up the gop 
nomination says he wants to be the education president but 
his campaign has kept its distance from bennett who has warred 
with teacher unions and pilloried college presidents 
bennett did not mention bush by name but said well probably 
have a good republican president in 88 wholl be there for a 
couple of terms if i do this this could be way in the future 
bennett informed president reagan last monday he is quitting the 
cabinet in midseptember to write and lecture he then declared at 
a congressional hearing the next day that if the education 
department is saved he will deserve most of the credit 
a lifelong democrat bennett switched to the gop in may 1986 15 
months after reagan put him in the cabinet he has proven a big 
draw at republican functions across the country 
asked if he was now wedded to the gop the 44yearold bennett 
replied probably 
only probably 
well sure look i was a democrat i shifted to the 
republican party because the democrats left the ranch and deserted 
their principles i dont see that happening in the republican 
party but i put country above party always have he said 
this will no doubt shock by sheer chutzpah some of my critics 
but we were not political we were principled and a lot of our 
principles went to the heart of what ronald reagan stands for 
and what a lot of liberal democrats stand against he said 
i know that im popular with audiences out there in the 
country and it doesnt seem to make much difference whether 
theyre democrats or republicans he said 
he agreed his relations with the education establishment may be 
at their nadir but i would bet my relations with the american 
people are at an alltime high 
he said he probably drove some people crazy by speaking out 
at cabinet meetings on issues other than education 
he decided early on that i may never have a job like this 
again so im going to do it all the way 
sometimes people rolled their eyes and said there he goes 
again he related i talked about drugs a lot use of the 
military and justice ginsburg aids and nicaragua but i decided i 
wasnt going to leave this job and say darn it i should have 
said this boy if i had it to do all over again 
bennett took it upon himself to call douglas ginsburg to urge 
him to withdraw as a supreme court nominee after ginsburgs 
admission that he smoked marijuana while a harvard law professor 
but bennett said he has not considered making such a call to his 
mentor edwin meese iii the embattled attorney general who is the 
subject of a yearlong criminal investigation and whose department 
has been hit with a succession of protest resignations

the threat to the philippines from rightwing 
soldiers has dwindled and the danger posed by communist insurgents 
has leveled off says philippine defense secretary fidel v ramos 
ramos who has been welcomed by some philippineamerican 
supporters as a hopedfor successor to president corazon aquino is 
making a 10day visit to the united states that includes meetings 
with top us officials 
his message is that his country cannot lick the communist threat 
with military force alone but still needs more military aid said 
philippine government spokesman ben david 
ramos a west point graduate who became authoritarian ruler 
ferdinand marcos no 2 military commander and then helped lead the 
february 1986 revolution that overthrew him was meeting today with 
us defense secretary frank carlucci he has meetings scheduled 
later in his visit with secretary of state george shultz members 
of congress and other officials 
we are now on the upgrade we have gotten out of the very deep 
hole where we found ourselves in february 1986 ramos told a 
mostly filipinoamerican gathering saturday night in the washington 
area 
but he said the country still faces serious problems including 
poverty social injustice the need for land reform and better 
education 
ramos said new reforms and the failure of communistsupported 
candidates in elections have helped limit growth of the insurgency 
that arose during marcos 20year rule 
but he said the communist rebels are still a significant force 
with up to 23000 fighters about twothirds of whom are armed he 
said that number has changed little since aquino came to power 
we have observed a leveling off in their strength he said 
noting that the communists were unable to defeat ratification of 
the constitution or elect more than a couple of candidates to 
congress 
asked about the threat from excol gregorio honasan who 
escaped after his arrest for attempting a coup last august ramos 
said renegade soldiers do not have the support or power to 
overthrow the government 
people have been turned off against them he said noting 
that more than 50 people were killed in honasans coup attempt 
we feel that while they have the capability of hitting and 
running their ability to undo the government is now very very 
diminished ramos said 
the military he said also has gone back to basics in its 
training instilling principles that will prevent other soldiers 
from rebelling 
in response to questions about whether he harbors presidential 
ambitions ramos said only that he planned to serve the government 
for two more years which he said would not include 1992 when mrs 
aquinos term ends the constitution does not allow her to run for 
reelection 
the philippine officials visit comes as the reagan 
administration is planning a 10 billion multinational program to 
aid the financially troubled philippines proposed by a bipartisan 
congressional group the plan calls for the administration to lead 
an effort to gather both public and private assistance from several 
countries 
at the same time us and philippine teams are meeting in 
manila to review agreements allowing us military bases in the 
country philippine officials have talked about huge increases in 
what the united states pays for use of the bases now about 180 
million a year 
speaking of the multinational aid plan ramos said i want to 
express the appreciation of our people for this gesture i hope it 
will not be just a gesture but will be manifested in real material 
aid because our people need it 
ramos added however that the government is also trying to make 
the country more independent by trying to foster selfreliant 
attitudes discipline and unity among its people

the final push is on for californias 
crucial presidential primary and jesse jacksons national campaign 
chairman willie brown should be in the thick of it 
instead brown is busy fighting a bid to oust him from his job 
as speaker of the assembly traditionally the second most powerful 
post in the state 
twice in the last week dissidents have tried unsuccessfully to 
remove brown from his job the first such attempts since he became 
speaker 7 years ago 
browns own political problems could diminish his usefulness to 
jackson as the clock ticks down on the june 7 contest however 
brown as the black leader of a predominantly white legislative 
body and a formidable fundraiser remains a force to be reckoned 
with 
known for his flamboyant style brown has already ruffled some 
feathers in the rest of the jackson campaign 
he stirred up trouble last month when he told a new york times 
reporter that a dukakisjackson matchup would be a good ticket 
the comment came at a time when jackson was trying to dampen talk 
that he was interested in something other than the nomination 
brown tried to back off the next day saying he meant that while 
a dukakisjackson ticket would be good a jacksondukakis ticket 
would be the best for the democrats but the damage was done 
brown also has recently said that the sooner democratic party 
chairman paul kirk leaves the better the party will be a 
statement that might not have endeared him to party regulars 
he told reporters in washington that dukakis doesnt come out 
of massachusetts with a great record on civil rights and he told 
the wall street journal that the party should not try to register 
white voters until were sure every black and every hispanic is 
registered 
despite such stumbles brown is still sounding confident about 
keeping the speakership and about jacksons chances in california 
i think he wins california he said this week of jacksons 
prospects dismissing polls indicating jackson trails dukakis 
browns prominence in the jacksons campaign is a factor 
although not a major one in his own political troubles 
he became speaker in december 1980 by putting together a 
coalition of republicans and democrats after a yearlong battle for 
the speakership between other democratic legislators his principal 
opponents now are five democrats mostly moderates from rural 
areas who call themselves the gang of five 
they were once close to brown enjoying prestigious committee 
assignments and chairmanships but they broke with brown last 
winter complaining that he had stacked committees with liberals to 
kill bills particularly anticrime measures supported by the 
public 
brown struck back at the gang stripping them of chairmanships 
moving them to the smallest offices in the capitol and at one point 
removing four of them from all committee assignments 
one of the five assemblyman charles calderon of montebello has 
criticized brown for heading the jackson campaign 
calderon told his hometown san gabriel daily tribune last 
january that brown rides around in a ferrari wears mink coats 
and competes with clint eastwood and other stars for notoriety 
the final straw calderon continued came when willie 
brown announced he was going to be the chair of the jesse jackson 
campaign committee 
browns association with jackson will be an extreme liability 
for democrats who are marginal and face gop challenges this year 
calderon said 
brown for his part has been attacking his foes in typically 
colorful terms 
in a divorce situation give me the kids or something dont 
suggest there was something wrong with me when you slept with me 
the first time he said at a news conference last month 
even if he is feeling the heat brown has joked about the 
attempts to get him out speaking to reporters he made mention of 
a luncheon he was invited to 
i was invited as speaker i would hate to go and say you 
invited the wrong man he said

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis back at the statehouse today after a western campaign 
swing is making apparent republican nominee george bush the target 
of his criticism and seeking to avoid harsh words about rival jesse 
jackson 
jackson was campaigning today in oregon which holds its primary 
tuesday but dukakis after two days of campaigning in california 
and oregon flew home sunday night 
on the way home dukakis made a brief stop in south orange 
nj for a statewide democratic dinner and attacked the reagan 
administration 
i dont want to see another four years or another eight years 
like the last seven dukakis told new jersey democrats our 
nation cant afford it our children dont deserve it and our 
economy cant sustain it 
jackson also addressed the group and the two met briefly 
beforehand dukakis declined to give any details but said he and 
his rival had a warm pleasant respectful discussion 
in california polls in california show him with a substantial 
lead over jackson dukakis aides acknowledge they are campaigning 
in california with an eyes both on the june 7 contest with jackson 
and a fall meeting with bush 
at a stop in los angeles on saturday for instance dukakis 
abandoned his usual appeal to ignore the polls and instead cited 
the ones showing him with a lead over the vice president both in 
california and nationwide 
although im always skeptical of poll numbers and early 
matchups he said i think the fact that in these early 
matchups between me and the vice president the fact that i am 
leading at least gives you some sense that this is doable 
at a weekend meeting with gay political activists in los 
angeles dukakis faced perhaps the most hostile encounter of his 
presidential campaign 
he faced shouts of bigot as gay leaders challenged him on 
issues of concern to homosexuals but their central complaint 
revolved around allowing homosexual couples to become foster 
parents an issue on which dukakis is unlikely to be hurt among 
the larger voting population 
dukakis planned to return to california to campaign by midweek

joe duncan whose darkblue state trooper 
uniform has been traded in for the prison whites of death row says 
if all legal appeals fail he will beg to be executed for the 
murder of his trooper girlfriend 
if we develop the evidence we expect to in the next few weeks 
ill get a new trial duncan said last week during his first 
interview from death row at holman prison 
but if the appeals fail the only choices are life without 
parole or death duncan 33 speaking amid clanging metal doors 
and inmates yells said he would prefer execution 
if i had no chance of getting out of this institution id 
beg them to put me in the electric chair he said 
duncan was sentenced april 12 in the shooting death of trooper 
elizabeth cobb 31 whose body was found oct 12 in her parked 
patrol car behind a church where duncan said they used to meet she 
was shot three times in the head 
duncan initially denied even knowing where the church was 
located but he changed his story saying he found miss cobbs 
stillwarm body and failed to tell anyone for fear of being 
implicated 
jurors recommended life without parole for duncan after 
prosecutors presented a case based mostly on circumstantial 
evidence stemming from duncans taped statements to investigators 
circuit judge jc norton however overturned the 
recommendation and sentenced him to death 
on may 12 duncans attorneys formally asked norton for a new 
trial among their reasons was an allegation that an unidentified 
juror may have known duncan and miss cobb 
officials believe duncan is the states first law officer to be 
sentenced to death 
there is no way to explain what its like to go from an 
alabama state trooper and im talking about probably the most 
prestigous law enforcement job in this state to death row in six 
months said duncan 
prosecutors said duncan killed miss cobb to collect 350000 
from a life insurance policy that went into effect 10 days before 
her death they said the policy was taken out june 30 and that 
duncan was named as beneficiary 
duncan said he developed a romantic relationship with miss 
cobb in early june and that they almost immediately began 
discussing marriage 
if joe duncan had put a gun to elizabeths head and killed her 
for money he ought to be put to death said duncan 
but duncan a 10year law enforcement veteran said he could 
have pulled off miss cobbs murder had he wanted i could have 
done it in a manner that wouldnt have pointed a finger at me 
he said the chief prosecutor assistant attorney general bill 
wasden misrepresented the facts while the judge allowed jurors to 
hear illegal evidence 
for instance he said the prosecution lied when it said he was 
badly in debt and needed the insurance money to pay among other 
things child support for his four children from a previous 
marriage 
duncan said he could have presented documented evidence that 
most of his debts were cleared in october 
duncan said he was pleased with his attorneys but 
dissatisfied with the defense we went with 
duncan did not have harsh words for the jury saying he could 
see where they probably came up with guilty verdict 
duncan who is among alabamas 96 inmates awaiting execution 
said he does not know whether anyone he helped put in jail might be 
imprisoned at holman 
he is receiving special security arrangements inmates are 
cleared from halls when duncan is coming through and he exercises 
alone for 45 minutes a day in a fenced area he compared to a dog 
run 
the inmates have been better to me than the institution has 
he said the animals at the birmingham zoo are in more humane 
conditions than what were in 
in my cell when i stand beside my bunk i cant take one step 
without hitting the wall

two gunmen opened fire on a 
lunchtime crowd in a pub patronized by roman catholics and police 
said three people were killed and six wounded 
the gunmen escaped in a stolen taxi after the attack on sunday 
the incident fueled fears of reprisals in the sectarian warfare 
that has ravaged this predominantly protestant british province 
since 1969 
an anonymous telephone caller to the british broadcasting corp 
claimed responsibility in the name of the protestant action force 
which has been linked to outlawed paramilitary groups responsible 
for assassinating scores of catholics in the early 1970s 
however the bbc said the caller did not give a recognized code 
witnesses said there were about 20 people in the avenue bar in 
union street when the attack occurred the gunmen had stolen a taxi 
in the nearby protestant shankill road just before the attack and 
afterward drove off in the direction of the shankill police said 
police said two people died at the scene and the third was 
pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital they identified the 
victims as damien devlin 24 paul mcbride 27 and stephen mcgahan 
ten people were taken to hospitals six with gunshot wounds and 
four suffering from shock police said 
britains northern ireland secretary tom king called the 
killings a revolting outrage 
gerry adams president of the irish republican armys legal 
political wing sinn fein said the attack was an attempt at 
premeditated mass murder 
the gunmen rang the pub bell and were admitted through the 
electronically operated door witnesses said 
a guy came in and took his time looking around and then 
started shooting said one witness who spoke on condition of 
anonymity then the other one came in behind him and started 
shooting at people it was just indiscriminate people were trying 
to dive for cover but they had no chance 
moments after the shooting three priests arrived to administer 
last rites to the dead 
police and troops rushed into the area and set up roadblocks 
and an army helicopter hovered above 
witnesses said a patrol of the ulster defense regiment a mainly 
protestant security force was near the pub during the attack but 
appeared to have seen nothing and carried on with its normal duties

the closeup is a simple picture 
of quiet relaxation a man wearing a us forest service hat casts 
his line into the water in hopes of hooking a spring chinook salmon 
but the wideangle view is different vice president george 
bush fishing with rafts kayaks and boats full of secret service 
agents reporters camera crews and hightech communications gear 
trailing him down the rapids 
and above on the cliffs is the motorcade limousine police 
cars and ambulance moving slowly down the road sunday 
for presidential nomineestobe almost nothing is simple add 
the complications of being an incumbent vice president and the 
entourage grows even more 
such a break in the middle of a weeklong western campaign swing 
is not just a matter of deciding to rent a boat bushs sevenmile 
ride down this southern oregon river involved nearly 100 people on 
the river and on the shore 
the trip echoed the environmental themes bush is trying to 
emphasize in advance of the oregon primary tuesday and to lay the 
groundwork for the general election battle in the pacific 
northwest bush is scheduled to visit a tree research lab near 
seattle and give an environmental speech later in the day 
the vice president spent much of sunday out in the brilliant 
spring sunshine 
one bite one strike bush said as he climbed into the 
14foot fishing boat to start the day 
ducks and osprey flew overhead in the morning sunshine as bush 
floated past other fishermen and small dredges used to mine gold 
from the river 
three hours later bush had to admit to a little boy on shore 
that the bite never came 
no but we sure had fun bush replied smiling just being 
out on that beautiful river we had a most relaxed morning 
clearing the mind i feel rejuvenated 
at a campaign rally later in seattle bush joked that his 
fishing exploits were not just bad luck 
they had all the fish chased away so we didnt get a bite 
he said 
four separate expedition companies provided the rafts and boats 
for the journey nineteen watercraft in all were used 
the main bush flotilla included seven boats ranging from a 
kayak to a jetpowered sheriffs patrol boat 
bush was in a 14foot fishing boat rowed by a guide and 
accompanied by a secret service agent 
several other boats and rafts carried more agents bush staff 
bureau of land management executives and communications gear one 
sported a complicated antenna that can and did communicate 
through a satellite while in the river valley near grants pass ore 
two large rafts held 12 news people including two television 
camera crews 
bush stopped along the way to talk to several people standing on 
the shore and frequently waved to onlookers from the woods and the 
cliffs 
the river trip was not a campaign swing in the usual sense but 
it had an environmental emphasis in step with the themes bush is 
hitting in oregon and washington 
bush has said he wants to take the environmental issue away from 
the democrats that he wants to be remembered as teddy roosevelt 
was a president who cared greatly for the environment and worked 
hard to preserve it 
thats a republican constituency bush told about 1000 
supporters at a seattle rally late sunday i want to leave a 
legacy of unspoiled land and water to our children and our 
childrens children 
on saturday bush visited a us forest service tree nursery 
where 25 million seedlings are being grown for reforesting the 
oregon and california hillsides 
after the trip bush was asked if he could fish better than 
likely democratic opponent michael dukakis 
i think so i done it all my life fishing requires 
experience bush said 
and the gop heir apparent was asked if he had seen any piranha 
in the river a reference to an image he used earlier in the week 
no but i saw some on the bridge bush said 
when there were questions about the extent of president reagans 
fervor in endorsing him bush blamed it on the pundits and the 
media

a bus carrying a church group home from 
an amusement park became a fiery deathtrap when a pickup truck 
traveling the wrong way on an interstate crashed into it killing 
27 people authorities said 
it was one of the worst bus accidents in us history the 
national transportation safety board said between 30 and 40 people 
were injured in the crash many suffering from burns 
the bus carrying 67 teenagers and adults from the first 
assembly of god church in radcliff about 35 miles south of 
louisville was headed south on interstate 71 when the accident 
occurred about 1055 pm saturday the group was returning from 
kings island amusement park north of cincinnati 
as word of the accident spread distraught relatives clutching 
dental and medical records arrived here sunday to help identify the 
dead 
the us army provided vans to transport family members from 
radcliff to carrollton about 75 miles away and state police 
escorted the parents to a local hotel 
state medical examiner dr george nichols met with about 60 
family members at the holiday inn at about noon he said he did not 
want family members to view the charred remains which he said 
would be identified with dental records 
the picture of their children in that room is not what 
they have in their memories or wallets he said 
nichols would not release a list of victims although he said all 
parents had been notified he said preliminary examinations 
indicated the 19 female and eight male victims all died of smoke 
inhalation 
nichols said it appeared all the victims were trying to flee the 
flames he said 25 bodies seemed headed toward the back of the bus 
one woman was found facing the front door and the body of the 
driver was found near the steering wheel with a fire extinguisher 
pin nearby 
at least eight of the injured including the truck driver were 
in critical condition sunday according to police and hospital 
officials 
state police trooper jim mudd said blood was taken from both 
drivers for testing as is the usual practice in kentucky in such 
cases but results probably would not be released until the case is 
submitted to a grand jury 
i just heard a crash felt the impact of the car truck and 
looked up and saw flames said 14yearold wayne cox an 
asthmatic who suffered smoke inhalation they spread pretty fast 
i was pinned everything was pretty wild i was under a lot of 
people thats probably what saved me from getting burned 
the flames quickly worked their way from the front to the rear 
of the bus survivors said leaving only the back door and windows 
as escape routes 
cox a radcliff middle school eighthgrader said he lost his 
shoes while wiggling out of the bus his blond hair was singed by 
the flames and his shirt was charred 
jason booher 13 also an eighthgrade student at radcliff 
middle school said he and another youth helped pull people out of 
the bus 
booher said he assisted survivors on the ground outside the back 
door while a meade county high school student jamie hardesty 
stood just inside the door and pushed people out 
jamie he pushed everyone out booher said he was up in 
the bus and i was out the back door of the bus helping those who 
were hurt 
booher said jamie who survived but could not be reached after 
he left the hospital sunday played a big part he saved a lot 
patrick presley a truck driver from dallas and one of the first 
on the scene said a second explosion filled the bus with flames 
and smoke and prevented more rescues after the initial impact 
the charred hull of the bus with bodies still inside was 
moved to the national guard armory in carrollton at 730 am a 
handful of family members looked on as the wreckage shrouded by a 
large tarp entered the back of the armory which is serving as the 
morgue mudd said 
at midafternoon nichols announced that the number of bodies 
found on the bus was 27 earlier the death toll had been given as 
at least 26 
carroll county coroner james dunn said the bus had been refueled 
just before the accident he speculated the gas tank may have 
ruptured spewing gas all over the bus and passengers 
mike sodrel who operates an intercity charter and tour service 
and is a director of the american bus association trade group said 
gasolinepowered school buses like the 1977 ford in the wreck are 
not designed for highspeed highway use he said intercity coaches 
use diesel fuel which has a higher flash point 
mudd said it was not known how long or why the toyota pickup was 
traveling the wrong way on the interstate 
no charges have been filed against the driver larry w mahoney 
34 of worthville in carroll county 
nichols said visual identification is impossible and said 
the process of identifying the bodies through dental charts and 
other clues could take several days 
this is a horrible task for anyone who cares for human life 
for such a joyous occasion to end in such sad tragedy mudd 
said 
denny brown chief of the campbellsburg volunteer fire 
department the first to arrive on the scene said the survivors 
were standing all the way up and down the road here 
steve watkins youth minister at the ghent baptist church near 
carrollton was among those called in to help counsel the parents 
theyre in shock thats all i can say he said 
the radcliff church held a special prayer service sunday as the 
family members of those killed began their trek to carrollton 
alan pollock a spokesman for the ntsb in washington dc said 
a team of investigators had been dispatched 
obviously they will looking at the integrity of the bus 
and trying to find out what started the fire he said 
what is believed to be the worst bus accident in us history 
occurred in 1963 when a bus collided with a train near salinas 
calif killing 32 farm workers

in 1933 brooklyn college staged a competition 
to choose an official anthem the winner began with these 
inspirational lines 
on campus green with towers of marble 
lifting white spires in the air 
oh brooklyn is our alma mater 
and she is wondrous fair 
not to mention wondrous gullible those lyrics it turns out a 
half century later were a joke and the college has decided to 
adopt a new alma mater 
in 1933 the college was a new workingclass school spread out 
in rented space in a halfdozen buildings in downtown brooklyn 
there was no campus green no towers of marble to lift white spires 
in the air 
but a professor decided that the college needed an alma mater 
the contestants included sylvia fine who would later marry 
entertainer danny kaye and become a songwriter and robert friend 
who would later move to israel and become a serious poet 
miss fine an earnest music student wrote her score in the 
style of a 19th century german university anthem friend a 
rebellious young leftist wrote his lyrics to parody the genre and 
sarcastically acknowledge the schools gritty surroundings 
but friends satire was lost on the college community even 
though his classmate irwin shaw once described the old campus as 
a scatter of buildings which we shared with running packs of 
lawyers and lofts whose previous tenants had gone broke there 
was a burlesque hall you hurried past on your way from victorian 
poetry to economics 1 
in the official college history a graduate recalls pushing his 
way through a crowd of lawyers politicians businessmen and 
office workers to the sound of auto horns and trolley gongs 
on smith avenue the gym in the basement of a loft building 
featured a ceiling 8 feet high 
over the years the songs words and music came to be credited 
incorrectly to sylvia fine kaye who never cared for them she 
cleared up the misconception at a college awards luncheon two years 
ago and offered to write new music and lyrics that would 
acknowledge the colleges move in 1936 to a pleasant new campus 
with trees and grass 
but there was a problem she was reluctant to proceed without 
friends permission and no one knew where he was 
there things stood until two months ago when college president 
robert l hess was in jerusalem at a brooklyn college alumni 
reunion 
in walked friend who recoiled when hess hailed him as the 
alma mater lyricist 
please i really want to forget about that he said 
friend it turned out was an established poet who had published 
several volumes one dedicated to the colleges students and 
teachers now he was embarrassed by the poetic lengths to which his 
youthful radicalism had pushed him 
i decided i would write a parody of alma maters he said 
brooklyn college had just opened and i thought a traditional 
alma mater was terribly inappropriate who needed it 
he told hess i wish youd get a new alma mater 
back in new york hess notified mrs kaye who produced a new 
song entitled a field in flatbush 
its opening lines 
on a former field in flatbush 
now a campus lush and green 
proudly stands our alma mater 
ever lovely and serene 
hess says he thinks the song is a big improvement and not 
because the composer recently donated 250000 to the scholarship 
fund 
i thought the old one was unsingable he said the lyrics 
were not right for something as down to earth as brooklyn college

prospects for economic growth are good 
this year but interest rates if they continue to rise threaten to 
topple the united states into a recession by the end of 1989 the 
countrys business leaders say 
most members of the business council composed of 61 chief 
executives of some of the nations largest companies say business 
so far in 1988 is better than they expected at the end of 1987 
when many were worried about the effects of the october stock 
market crash 
now the executives with the exception of those heading 
financial service firms such as brokerage and insurance companies 
report signs of moderate or better growth 
the car business is going great actually stronger than any of 
us anticipated said roger b smith chairman of general motors 
corp 
other executives attending the councils twiceayear meeting 
last weekend at the homestead a posh resort in the mountains of 
western virginia echoed smiths sentiments reporting other signs 
of strong demand 
were seeing a surprising increase in demand for motor 
gasoline in the united states at least 2 percentage points above 
what we expected said george m keller chairman of chevron corp 
but amid the satisfaction over the countrys more than 
5yearold business expansion the longest since the 1960s was 
concern that possible renewed inflation could trigger rising 
interest rates 
charles w parry retired chairman of the aluminum company of 
america said prices of metals chemicals and other basic 
commodities are up significantly 
such a rise often has been a precursor of an increase in 
inflation rates and that has me a little bit worried parry 
said 
a forecast representing a consensus of economists employed by 
business council member companies predicts modest growth as 
measured by the gross national product of 24 percent this year 
that compares with 38 percent in 1987 
a inflationary signs remain muted the economists said 
predicting a rise in consumer prices of 39 percent this year and 
46 percent in 1989 compared with 44 percent last year 
however the economists sounded a warning that overly robust 
growth could produce an unavoidable rise in interest rates and a 
recession before the end of 1989 
underscoring the warning major banks raised their prime lending 
rate from 85 percent to 9 percent only two days before the council 
began its meeting 
interest rates already seem to be outstripping the councils 
forecasts which were prepared about a week in advance of the 
conference 
the average yield on 30year bonds issued by the treasury last 
week was 917 percent the executives were looking for an average 
rate on 30year bonds of 89 percent this year and 93 percent next 
year 
however willard c butcher chairman of the chase manhattan 
bank said i think were overdoing fears of inflation and 
suggested that interest rates may fall back a bit by the end of 
1988 
although the economy is doing a little better than expected 
growth is still moderate he said 
we tend to be more worried today about how the economy does 
against how we predicted than how it actually does he said

the senate could begin debate as early as 
tuesday on the ussoviet mediumrange missile treaty opening a 
race to ratify it before president reagans summit with mikhail s 
gorbachev 
just 13 days remain before the may 29 opening of the moscow 
summit and it is an open question whether the senate can conclude 
debate on the landmark arms control pact in the time remaining 
the last predebate hurdle came today as the senates foreign 
relations intelligence and armed services committee held hearings 
to examine the anticheating arrangements agreed to in geneva last 
week by secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
reagan wants to take a ratified treaty to the kremlin to spur 
further arms control progress especially on the strategic arms 
reduction or start treaty aimed at cutting longrange nuclear arms 
by as much as 50 percent 
many senators of both parties join the president in that hope 
but hope may not carry the day 
most vote counts show that in the final tally the senate will 
consent to the ratification of the pact by an overwhelming margin 
far greater than the required 67 votes 
but opponents could slow the pace of debate to a crawl 
demanding votes on amendment after amendment 
the leading treaty foe sen jesse helms rnc says he has 
something like a dozen amendments ready for debate 
one would require the withdrawal of all us military forces 
from europe on grounds that the treatys required elimination of 
us mediumrange pershing ii and groundlaunched cruise missiles 
would leave them defenseless 
the amendment would have the effect of repudiating us 
participation in the nato alliance and it is unlikely to be adopted 
after a briefing on friday by national security adviser colin 
powell the chairmen and ranking republican members of those 
committees told reporters their initial reaction was that shultz 
had persuaded the soviets to back away from unacceptable 
restrictions on onsite inspection on each of nine issues raised 
but senate majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia said 
he would schedule debate on the treaties only after the three 
committees met and agreed the verification arrangements are in us 
national security interests 
byrd has promised to open debate immediately once he gets 
clearance from the three committees that could mean as early as 
tuesday if no further snags develop 
byrd has insisted throughout that the treaty is too important to 
tie its consideration to an artificial arbitrary automatic 
calendar deadline such as the date of the summit opening 
reagan and gorbachev signed the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces or inf treaty at their washington summit last december it 
requires the total elimination of us and soviet missiles with a 
range of between 300 and 3400 miles 
the treaty is an arms control landmark even though by itself it 
requires a reduction of only about 4 percent of the missiles in 
superpower nuclear arsenals 
if ratified it will be the first arms control treaty to go into 
effect since the antiballistic missile or abm treaty was ratified 
in 1972 
it also is the first arms control treaty actually to reduce 
nuclear weapons rather than to impose ceilings on how many missiles 
each side can possess the reductions require the elimination of an 
entire class of missiles designed to carry nuclear weapons to their 
targets 
arms control supporters hope that will open the door to the much 
deeper cuts in intercontinental strategic weapons envisioned in the 
start treaty 
the inf treaty also represents another sort of arms control 
breakthrough it marks the first time the soviet union has ever 
accepted any form of onsite inspection on soviet soil to verify 
compliance with an arms control agreement and detect cheating 
us negotiators hope soviet acceptance of onsite inspection 
for the inf can be used as a buildingblock precedent for a treaty 
reducing strategic longrange arms by up to 50 percent 
but such a treaty would be far more difficult to monitor because 
of the far greater number of weapons involved and because not all 
weapons of a single class would be destroyed

a ban on imports of strategic metals from 
south africa would cost the us economy at least 185 billion a 
year and bring shortages of a key component of auto pollution 
control equipment according to a bureau of mines study 
about 94 percent of the costs would result from a cutoff of 
south african shipments of platinum and rhodium with the rest 
spread among other metals including palladium manganese chromium 
titanium and vanadium the study said 
platinum palladium and rhodium are essential constituents of 
pollutioncontrol catalytic converters on automobiles in the united 
states and japan other members of the platinum group are 
ruthenium iridium and osmium 
recycling reduced consumption other imports and higher 
domestic production could close the gap for most metals the study 
said but a major domestic shortage of rhodium could be 
expected 
for all the metals in question south africa is either the 
largest or secondlargest producer in the world the united states 
imports half to all its supplies of all of them though not 
entirely from south africa for any one the soviet union is a major 
supplier of many of the metals and the study warned that 
dependence on soviet supplies would increase if south african 
metals werent available 
the study was requested by the state department after 
antiapartheid sanctions against south africa were enacted by 
congress in 1986 measures which did not affect the metals trade 
the house foreign affairs committee earlier this month approved a 
new bill which would end all us investment in south africa and 
ban almost all trade but would not affect strategic metals 
some analysts have said south africa could forbid shipment of 
the metals as a retaliation 
the bureau of mines study assumed that under an embargo on 
metals shipments to the united states shipments to other countries 
would continue if south african supplies were cut off to 
everybody economic impacts will be greater than in the case of a 
us embargo 
it also assumed no use would be made of emergency stockpiles 
held in the united states for use by the defense department that 
no production incentives would be applied and that no technological 
improvements would be forthcoming it limited its forecasts to the 
next five years 
no estimate was made of the effects of an overall disruption 
but figures were given from an earlier study of chromium and 
manganese an embargo would cost 30 million a year for chromium 
and 31 million for manganese a total disruption would cost an 
average of 12 billion a year for chromium and 330 million for 
manganese 
costs would be incurred in the form of higher prices for 
alternate supplies for expanding us production and recycling and 
for switching to substitutes for example the cost of platinum 
could be expected to rise from about 1300 an ounce to about 
8600 an ounce the study said 
rhodium shortages would arise because the metal has been used in 
auto catalysts since 1981 compared with 1974 for the other two 
catalyst metals so not as much is available for recycling because 
practically none is being recovered from cars now being junked a 
recycling system would have to be built from scratch 
as a result of the embargo there are insufficient available 
world supplies to meet domestic demand in the second and third 
years of the embargo the study said 
consumption decreases can be expected in both auto catalysts 
and other industrial applications and may result in impacts on 
domestic industrial production 
no effort was made to calculate the costs to the economy of 
production losses caused by shortages

about 20 mediumsecurity inmates agreed 
early mondayto peacefully end their 3dayold prison uprising after 
authorities said the surrender could be televised according to 
officials 
late sunday the inmates released one of three guards they were 
holding hostage authorities said 
the inmates whose rebellion at the mack alford correctional 
center began late friday and resulted in 25 million in damages 
agreed to surrender at 830 am cdt monday if the surrender is 
televised warden ted wallman said through a spokesman 
prison officials agreed to that demand and a demand that state 
legislators observe the surrender said the spokesman jerry massie 
the guard was released in exchange for food and a meeting with 
three state legislators officials said 
we gave them some pop ice cream and cigarettes and they 
talked to some legislators corrections department spokeswoman 
joy hadwiger said 
the inmates who hung bedsheet banners that called for white 
power and accused corrections officials of lying as the siege 
stretched into a third day released prison capt lewis mcgee she 
said 
he was in apparently good health she added and the other 
hostages were also thought to be unharmed 
anita trammell another spokeswoman for the prison said earlier 
that no resolution was in sight with the inmates believed armed 
with crude knives 
the prison administration for the first time sunday night 
released a list of the captors demands 
ms trammell said that besides the ice cream and cigarettes the 
demands included having the electricity turned back on in their 
area and having meetings with reporters and with lou bullock an 
american civil liberties attorney who has helped prisoners in the 
past 
the inmates also asked for the return of a bus that was made 
available to take the inmates to a federal prison late saturday as 
they requested but left empty when negotiations broke down 
late in the afternoon two inmates took one of the guards 
outside for less than 10 minutes and talked briefly to correctional 
officers through a fence in a remote corner of the prison 
a prison spokesman said the guard appeared to be all right as 
did the two other guards when they were spotted earlier in the day 
ms trammell said the guard identified as sgt harold yoder 
was used a shield by the inmates who worked to close a hole in the 
fence cut by prison officials to help other inmates surrender 
she said the hostage takers have told the roughly 30 other 
inmates locked in the ocupied south dorm that their lives would be 
in danger if they try to leave she said however that those 
inmates said they dont feel like hostages 
the spokeswoman also said other inmates who have been moved out 
of damaged parts of the prison said the hostage takers are 
ridiculous and crazy 
inmates also hung sheets with messages written on them from the 
roof of the twostory dormitory where the hostages were held 
the first sheet said white power while a second sheet hung 
later referred to the state department of corrections and said 
doc will not respond to demands they have lied to you the public 
and press 
commenting on the first banner ms trammell said i feel like 
the inmates did that for attention also i feel like we have some 
racists up there 
of the three hostage guards one is white one is black and one 
is an american indian 
there have been unconfirmed reports that a racial incident set 
off the violence at the 33yearold prison late friday 
later a third sheet was hung requesting help from the press 
but small letters and shade made it impossible to read the whole 
message 
according to authorities the uprising began when officers tried 
to move five inmates to a maximumsecurity prison the five had 
reportedly threatened other inmates who allegedly had stolen from 
them 
the inmates then seized eight hostages five hostages were 
released unharmed saturday one guard and one inmate were injured 
in the violence which also caused about 25 million in damage 
it had been reported from the start that 10 inmates were 
actively involved in holding the guards however ms trammell 
quoted the warden as saying the number was closer to 20 
most of the prisoners who were routed from their dorms were 
transferred to other prisons corrections department spokeswoman 
joy hadwiger in oklahoma city said 150 were being held in a 
gymnasium area of the prison awaiting relocation with 51 in the 
south dorm where the hostages were being held 
carolyn yoder wife of one of the hostages said earlier that 
authorities should use a special weapons and tactics team to end 
the standoff 
those boys are smart enough to know what theyre doing she 
said id feel a lot safer with them going in there to take my 
husband 
the prison opened in 1955 is located in southeastern oklahoma 
about 130 miles from oklahoma city it has the sixthlargest prison 
population in oklahoma with 652 inmates but has an operational 
capacity of just 492 corrections officials said

members of congress fear a recent court ruling 
may have stripped away two centuries of legal protection for their 
official activities exposing them to lawsuits for monetary damages 
the house has gone on record against the decision and an appeal 
by the house lawyer of the case involving rep don sundquist says a 
pandoras box of law suits may have been opened 
lawmakers are protected by the constitution from suits over 
their activities on the floor and in committee 
but legal experts say an appelate court ruling on the sundquist 
case has left members of congress without a wider immunity granted 
throughout the nations history by federal courts 
members believed these earlier rulings protected them against 
damage suits based on their actions at news conferences in 
communications with government agencies and related activities 
this wider protection still extends to other federal employees 
from cabinet members to custodians according to house legal 
experts 
in the case of sundquist rtenn the us court of appeals for 
the district of columbia ruled 21 last november that lawmakers are 
not immune from civil suits arising from their attempts to 
influence the conduct of executive agencies 
in an appeal asking the supreme court to review the case chief 
house counsel steven r ross said the twojudge panel decision 
threatens to open a pandoras box of tort suits by those who 
disagree with or are offended by members of congress 
the panels decision announces that every state and district 
in the country has sent to the capitol a walking deep pocket the 
causes of action to be filed against this singularly exposed group 
will know no limit 
outraged by the appellate court decision the house last week 
voted 4130 for a resolution demanding that members performing 
official duties be treated by the courts with the same respect 
and protection afforded all other public officials 
the resolution also urged that the supreme court review the 
decision written by us circuit judge james buckley a former 
republican senator from new york 
the suit against sundquist was filed after the lawmaker wrote 
former attorney general william french smith in 1985 criticizing 
memphis area legal services in a dispute over its representation of 
clients in child support cases 
sundquist wrote that the agency supplying legal services to the 
poor seems to be employing at least one attorney wayne chastain 
to do nothing but harass juvenile court officials he also said 
chastain works in concert with two convicted felons sundquist 
made his letter public 
chastain filed a 1 million defamation suit a us district 
judge in washington ruled sundquist had official immunity but the 
appellate court overturned that ruling 
the appellate court said sundquist has every right to monitor 
and challenge the manner in which the legal services corp 
operates if he does so within the halls of congress 
but the court added no imperative of office requires that a 
member of congress while acting outside the scope of his 
legislative duties be free to reach out with impunity and name 
names without regard for the consequence to individual 
reputations 
the constitution gives members of congress full protection from 
civil suits and criminal charges resulting from their direct 
legislative actions such as speeches on the floor or in committee 
but until now court decisions also gave members of congress the 
wider protection enjoyed by federal employees carrying out their 
duties in good faith 
ross said the wider immunity has always been a safety net when 
the constitutional protection didnt apply 
we regained protection by pushing the alternative form of 
protection official immunity ross said the danger of this 
decision is that it cuts away the safety net of backup immunity 
after the sundquist ruling ross tried to get the full us 
court of appeals in washington to hear the case 
six of 11 judges agreed with him but seven votes were needed

the foreign secretary today said the 
united states should pay more for its military bases in the 
philippines 
foreign secretary raul manglapus also said the united states 
should pay the increase regardless of whether the philippine 
government gives assurances that the bases will be allowed to stay 
after their lease expires in 1991 
if the us cannot afford it i dont think they should be 
here at all manglapus told reporters its all up to the 
united states if they can afford it they can stay if they 
cannot they should go 
manglapus is chief of a filipino panel which is reviewing along 
with a us panel the status of the 1947 pact under which the 
americans maintain clark air base the subic bay naval base and 
four smaller installations 
a successful review is expected to influence manilas decision 
on allowing the bases to remain after the current agreement expires 
filipino officials have demanded a substantial increase in the 
180 million they receive yearly for use of the bases 
us ambassador nicholas platt the chief american negotiator 
has warned that budget constraints may make it difficult for 
washington to provide a substantial increase 
us officials say they are working with japan west germany and 
other american allies to put together a major new aid package for 
the philippines 
president corazon aquino has said she does not want the new aid 
linked to the future of the bases 
mrs aquino has pledged to honor the bases agreement through 
1991 but refuses to say whether she would support an extension 
a growing number of filipinos want to close the bases which 
they see as a vestige of american colonial rule

most of the survivors of a fatal church bus 
crash were asleep when the accident occurred and awakened to a 
nightmare of bodies on top of bodies and orange everywhere a 
passenger says 
i didnt know what had happened until i was out of the bus and 
i saw it blow up said allen tennison 15 the son of the pastor 
of the first assembly church of god at radcliff 
i chased after some of my friends to find out what had 
happened i thought it was a dream i asked one of my friends if i 
was dreaming 
tennison said the fire that engulfed the converted school bus 
after the accident about 1055 pm saturday that left 27 people 
most of them teenagers dead was like a fireball shooting 
straight through the bus 
most of the survivors were in the back of the bus and got out 
the emergency exit he said 
tennison was interviewed at the church parsonage where he lives 
his father the rev don tennison did not accompany the group on 
the trip 
i felt it crash but it didnt wake me up i heard a scream 
and i remember seeing bodies on top of bodies and orange 
everywhere i was pushed out the back door most were pushed out 
he said sunday 
john pearman a church official who is missing and believed to 
be among the dead had hollered for everyone to get out of the bus 
before the explosion he said 
tennison said the mood at the scene was relatively calm 
theres one thing im proud of everyone was helping someone 
else he said they didnt panic they remained calm everyone 
was a hero in their own way 
it freaked me out to seem them friends coal black but i knew 
they needed someone to help them im lucky because few people 
escaped with no injuries 
we knew we were in gods hands and it calmed people to pray 
most of those aboard the bus were from the radcliff church some 
church members had brought friends from other congregations in the 
area on the outing to kings island amusement park north of 
cincinnati 
the bus was struck headon by a pickup truck traveling in the 
wrong lane of interstate 71 near carrollton 
i just heard a crash felt the impact of the car truck and 
looked up and saw flames said 14yearold wayne cox a radcliff 
middle school eighthgrader they spread pretty fast i was 
pinned everything was pretty wild i was under a lot of people 
thats probably what saved me from getting burned 
jason booher 13 also an eighthgrade student at radcliff 
middle school said he and another youth helped pull people out of 
the bus 
booher said he assisted survivors on the ground outside the back 
door while a meade county high school student jamie hardesty 
stood just inside the door and pushed people out 
jamie he pushed everyone out booher said he was up in 
the bus and i was out the back door of the bus helping those who 
were hurt 
booher said jamie played a big part he saved a lot 
tennison also credited hardesty with directing medical personnel 
to the more seriously injured survivors

school buses like the one involved in a 
fatal wreck near here saturday are not designed for highspeed 
highway use a bus company executive says 
a school bus is a specialized vehicle designed to transport a 
high number of students over rural roads at relatively low speed 
said mike sodrel who operates an intercity charter and tour 
service 
a typical intercity coach like a greyhound weighs 26000 to 
28000 pounds empty a typical school bus will weigh less than half 
that he said 
a pickup truck traveling in the wrong direction on interstate 71 
north of louisville plowed into a former school bus operated by a 
church in radcliff ky just before midnight saturday the bus 
which had just been refueled burst into flames and many victims 
were not able to flee the wreckage 
sodrel is president of the free enterprise system inc an 
intercity charter and tour service with 17 buses based in 
jeffersonville ind across the ohio river from louisville he 
also is a director of the american bus association a trade group 
based in washington dc 
the fuel tanks on our coaches are mounted forward of the rear 
axle and are inboard he said whats more significant is that 
intercity coaches are dieselpowered and diesel fumes are not 
explosive diesel fuel will burn but the flash point is 
considerably higher than gasoline 
saturdays crash involved a 1977 ford school bus that took 
regular gasoline authorities said 
sodrel said he had no special knowledge of the bustruck 
collision and was speaking in general terms about bus safety 
he said in an interview sunday that the us department of 
transportation has the authority to enforce certain safety 
regulations on private buses in addition to forhire coaches but 
they have not yet elected to do that 
he said legislation is pending in the us house to direct the 
dot to do that 
john snyder executive director of the trade association said 
the group has encouraged enforcement of the rules remaining since 
partial deregulation of the industry in the mid1980s deregulation 
led to an increase in bus companies across the country and 
competitive pressures he said 
when you start cutting costs safety sometimes starts to 
suffer he said 
that is why our association and our board are so strong in 
support of safety we have seen a strengthening of the enforcement 
process in the last couple of years he said referring to both 
official efforts and industry adherance 
snyder made his remarks in a telephone interview from his home 
in indianapolis

americans overwhelmingly favor the ussoviet 
mediumrange nuclear missile treaty but share fears in congress 
that moscow cannot be trusted to comply according to a media 
generalassociated press poll 
the poll also found that americans view soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev nearly as favorably as they do president reagan and 
gorbachev outpolls reagan among collegeeducated americans 
seventythree percent of those polled in the national survey 
supported the accord to eliminate mediumrange missiles and as 
many said they would back a treaty to cut each nations longrange 
arsenal in half 
but 61 percent said the soviets cant be trusted to live up to 
their arms control agreements that reflected sentiment in the 
senate which last week demanded clarification of the anticheating 
rules in the pact 
the poll was conducted among a random sample of 1204 adults 
interviewed by telephone from april 29may 8 ending less than a 
month before reagan and gorbachev meet in moscow 
as strongly protreaty as they were a nearmajority of 
americans were not willing to drop reagans proposed missile 
defense system known as star wars in exchange for a soviet 
agreement to a big cut in nuclear arms fortynine percent opposed 
such a trade while just onethird supported it 
the public was split on the issue along political and 
ideological lines republicans and conservatives strongly opposed 
dropping star wars for a big missile cut while democrats and 
liberals favored such an agreement 
without an agreement 56 percent said work on star wars should 
proceed as it is now or be increased while 30 percent said it 
should be reduced or dropped there again was a political division 
73 percent of republicans wanted work on star wars kept up 
compared with 41 percent of democrats 
similarly there was an ideological division in support for the 
mediumrange treaty and for a treaty if one can be reached to 
halve the longrange arsenals the pacts fared worst among 
conservatives 20 percent were opposed and best with liberals 
whose opposition was in single digits about 67 percent of 
conservatives and 83 percent of liberals were in favor 
the survey found broad support for reagans handling of 
ussoviet relations with 71 percent approving and a high 
positive view of reagan generally with 59 percent rating him 
favorably 
nearly as many 54 percent expressed a positive view of 
gorbachev the poll found among college graduates 71 percent 
rated gorbachev favorably while 62 percent viewed reagan favorably 
among those who have done postgraduate work 76 percent saw 
gorbachev favorably compared with 50 percent favorable for reagan 
reagan had the approval of the polls respondents for his may 
29june 2 summit with gorbachev in moscow seventyeight percent 
said the president and the soviet leader should meet at regular 
intervals even without any major items on the agenda 
the survey gave a mixed report on ussoviet competition 
fortyone percent said the united states had more political 
influence in the world and just 14 percent said the soviets had 
more political influence thirtyeight percent said the countries 
were about equally influential 
the rating was closer on military strength 33 percent said the 
soviets were stronger militarily 28 percent said the united states 
was stronger and 29 percent said the countries were about equally 
strong 
poll respondents largely rejected the opinion of critics that 
nuclear arms treaties may increase the chance of nonnuclear war a 
majority said the mediumrange missile treaty would not make much 
difference in the chance of conventional war in europe and 26 
percent said it would decrease the chance 
just 11 percent said the treaty would increase the chance of 
conventional war in europe that figure doubled though when 
respondents were asked if abolition of all us and soviet nuclear 
weapons would increase the chance of nonnuclear war 22 percent 
still a minority said it would

a parasitic mite attacking bee colonies around the 
country threatens to leave americas cranberry growers without 
enough bees for pollination this year and hurt production of other 
crops and honey officials say 
massachusetts the nations leader in cranberry production is 
hiring more bee inspectors to keep out the pinheadsize mite known 
as varroa jacobsoni which can quickly destroy bee colonies and has 
been found in 13 states 
there wont be enough bees for a good thorough job of 
pollination said irving demoranville director of the university 
of massachusetts cranberry experiment station in wareham 
the nations more than 900 cranberry growers last year produced 
350 million pounds valued at 188 million according to david 
farrimond general manager of the warehambased cranberry marketing 
committee 
growers rely on migratory beekeepers now heading north for work 
pollinating fruit and vegetable crops this spring and summer 
last month the federal government imposed a quarantine on 
interstate bee transportation in the 13 states about six months 
after the varroa mite was detected in wisconsin but the quarantine 
was lifted after proving too costly and unmanageable and 
inspection was turned over to states 
we clearly did not have a workable quarantine to assure that 
we were going to be able to control the spread we found it likely 
that a lot of them were going to move their bees regardless said 
nancy robinson spokeswoman for the us department of 
agricultures animal and plant health inspection sevice 
beekeepers eager to assuage growers are taking out ads in 
cranberries magazine a national trade publication saying their 
bees are clean 
cranberry growers say beekeepers with contaminated bees who 
cross state lines could spead the infestation massachusetts 
farmers say the mite has reached the state although that has not 
been confirmed 
growers say the spread of the mite could have a longterm impact 
on fruit vegetable and honey production 
there is a lot of concern said douglas beaton president of 
the cape cod cranberry growers association if it goes unchecked 
then our crops will most surely be threatened in two or three 
years 
massachusetts last year produced 160 million pounds of 
cranberries worth 83 milllion on 11600 acres according to state 
food and agriculture department figures ninetyeight percent of 
the crop depends on wild domestic honeybees for pollination 
the national cranberry crop would suffer a 30 percent to 50 
percent drop without bees to pollinate them said jon gottschalk a 
phillips wis cranberry grower and board member of ocean spray 
cranberries inc the industry cooperative 
as apple buds begin to blossom in massachusetts this month 
migratory beekeepers from out of state have started arriving and 
their bees and equipment are being checked for the mite 
the state has hired two inspectors to monitor migratory 
beekeepers said peter c kuzmiski chief of the state plant and 
pest control bureau he said five or six inspectors would be on 
duty by midjune when cranberries begin to blossom 
beekeepers are not optimistic about preventing the mites spread 
theres no way possible that they will keep them out of the 
state said joseph mello past president of the massachusetts 
federation of beekeepers they will make it in and eventually we 
will have the problem throughout the entire state its a problem 
that will be here to stay 
the federal environmental protection agency in january approved 
use of the chemical fluvalinate to fumigate bees and hives for the 
mites a plastic strip containing fluvalinate kills the mite but 
not enough is believed to be available to treat all the bees now 
contaminated 
the varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their 
developing larvae it decreases the number of larvae deforms bees 
and weakens a colonys ability to pollinate plants and produce 
honey 
the 13 states where the bee mite has been found are florida 
illinois maine michigan mississippi nebraska new york ohio 
pennsylvania south carolina south dakota washington and 
wisconsin 
in addition to honey production a bee shortage would reduce 
pollination of apples blueberries cucumbers squash and other 
fuits and vegetables

high above downtown two wild peregrine falcon 
chicks pecked out of their shells in a nest on a skyscraper ledge 
to baltimoreans the hatching of another clutch of the 
endangered species is almost old hat a pair of peregrines have 
been raising families on the 33rdfloor ledge of the united states 
fidelity amp guaranty corp building since 1984 and at least one 
peregrine has lived on the building since 1979 
but the migration of falcons to cities is a surprising 
development in a successful experiment begun by cornell university 
in 1970 to reintroduce the predatory bird to southern canada and 
the continental united states after ddt and other pesticides 
decimated the species 
baltimore was the first city the falcons chose the first of the 
birds which were raised in captivity drifted down from a new 
jersey marsh the latest chicks were hatched two weeks ago by 
falcons named blythe and beauregard 
today released peregrines and their offspring nest in 20 us 
cities according to experts urban homes include skyscrapers along 
wilshire boulevard in los angeles on a bridge over the schuylkill 
river in philadelphia on the san francisco and oakland ends of the 
bay bridge in new york city and on the hotel utah in salt lake 
city 
falcons also have settled in the mountains of new england and in 
cliffs and rock quarries in the carolinas and virginia 
to falcons skyscrapers and bridges resemble cliffs and mountain 
peaks 
all they have to do is become accustomed to helicopters and 
human noises and theyll do fine said john barber falcon 
guardian and data manager at usfampg peregrines mate for life and 
live 15 to 20 years 
barber said falcons chose cities partly because pigeons had no 
predators 
and most cities are cheering them on because obviously the 
pigeon population is way out of control he said 
in los angeles two pairs of peregrines set up housekeeping 
seven miles apart on wilshire boulevard said brian walton 
coordinator of the predatory bird group at the university of 
california santa cruz 
the peregrines fly up and down that street using the 
skyscrapers like a string of mountain peaks he said 
most of the birds were released from artificial structures such 
as towers in marshes which may explain their attraction to bridges 
and tall buildings said cornell ornithology professor tom cade 
i think they develop some sort of association or fixation 
early in life for these structures every tower we built is now 
occupied by a nesting pair said cade chairman of the peregrine 
fund inc 
the fund a nonprofit organization that cosponsors the 
repopulation project has received inquiries about using peregrines 
to keep pigeons in check however cade said falcons arent the 
answer to urban pigeon blight because each pair takes 10 square 
miles for its territory 
the immediate area benefits as pigeons avoid peregrine perches 
cade said 
historically peregrines have not shunned human beings although 
they kept their distance cade said peregrines raised chicks on 
the pyramids of egypt and european castles and cathedrals have been 
traditional nesting sites kings hunted with the falcons which can 
be trained but not tamed

a videotape shows an exprep school student who 
strangled a woman in central park acting out strangulations and 
partying with nearly naked women before testimony in his murder 
trial according to television producers 
the videotape obtained by the nationally syndicated program a 
current affair is to be used in a twopart story on the robert 
chambers case scheduled for broadcast tonight and tuesday 
the tape shown to reporters sunday was made in a manhattan 
apartment last december around the time a jury was being selected 
for chambers trial for the 1986 death of 18yearold jennifer dawn 
levin according to rafael abramovitz a reporterproducer for the 
show 
miss levin was killed during a sexual encounter 
in one of the most bizarre sequences on the tape chambers 21 
is seen sitting his back to the camera facing several young women 
and playing with a doll 
suddenly a grinning chambers looks into the camera and twists 
the small dolls head 
my name is chambers said in a falsetto his voice 
trailing off oops i think ive killed it both of its eyes are 
like 
at another point chambers performed in a game of charades by 
grabbing his neck in a tight grip with his right hand and 
collapsing to the floor 
death of a salesman one of the young women guessed 
correctly

deadly earthquakes that jolted southern 
california in july 1986 and last october may have been triggered by 
abnormal air pressure patterns over the pacific ocean and western 
united states a researcher says 
scripps institution of oceanography meterologist jerome namias 
studied moderate and large quakes in the region since 1947 and 
found they tended to occur a month to six weeks after the onset of 
the unusual atmospheric pressure patterns and associated winds 
during the summer and fall 
we know so little about why earthquakes occur when they do 
that weve got to keep an open mind even on what seems like a 
farout kind of idea said geologistgeophysicist clarence allen 
of the california institute of technology 
allen said that while he guesses the correlation will turn out 
to be coincidental its too early to rule out these kinds of 
things and namias is certainly a very respected scientist 
the statistical correlation between earthquakes and air pressure 
is weak difficult to explain in scientifically respectable terms 
and definitely a farout idea said namias who spent 30 years 
as chief of the national weather services extended forecast 
division in washington 
but if atmospheric pressure patterns are related to quakes it 
may be because winds associated with the patterns raise offshore 
sea levels slightly putting more pressure on the earth he 
speculated during a recent telephone interview from la jolla 
forces from unsual air pressure patterns and higher sea levels 
are smaller than the moons tidal influence on earth and its 
oceans and seismologists still debate whether lunar gravity 
triggers quakes said tom heaton scientist in charge of the us 
geological surveys pasadena office 
if we cant prove that tides do it it seems a longshot that 
any pattern of atmospheric pressure does it heaton said 
namias found quakes of at list 45 on the richter scale were 
associated with an abnormally strong gradient between very high 
sealevel atmospheric pressure over the eastern half of the north 
pacific and very low surfacelevel pressure over the interior 
portion of the western third of the nation 
the unusual pattern existed before the 59magnitude whittier 
narrows quake and its aftershocks which rocked southern california 
last october killing eight people injuring more than 200 and 
causing 358 million in damage namias said 
he said the pattern preceded three hefty jolts in 1986 the 
59magnitude july 8 palm springs quake which caused 53 million 
in damage the 53magnitude july 13 oceanside quake which killed 
one injured 28 others and caused 720000 in damage and the 
6magnitude july 21 chalfant valley quake near bishop which caused 
436500 in damage 
the abnormal pattern involved barometer readings of roughly 301 
inches of mercury offshore and roughly 2975 over the interior 
namias said adding that some of the pattern existed last week but 
was very weak 
namias said the unusual largescale air pressure pattern is 
unrelated to local weather or to what some people contend is 
earthquake weather unseasonably hot dry windy conditions 
such as those last october 
namias said he noticed the quakeair pressure pattern 
correlation years ago but even after the 1986 quakes he decided 
id keep my mouth shut on the topic because he knew 
seismologists would be dubious 
he changed his mind after last octobers shocks writing a paper 
published last month in the journal geophysical research letters 
namias said he noted the quakeair pressure correlation only 
during summer and fall months 
in addition to speculating that winds related to the pressure 
pattern might raise sea levels namias said largescale winds might 
affect the ground directly he said earths rotation and thus the 
length of a day changes slightly over the decades because of wind 
drag on earths surface 
other scientists have suggested a link between volcanic activity 
in indonesia and variations in atmospheric pressure wind and sea 
levels namias said

prime minister prem tinsulanonda left 
today for a visit to the soviet union and a top aide said he would 
ask moscow to pressure vietnam to end its occupation of cambodia 
prems twoweek trip which also included stops in finland and 
hungary comes during deep domestic political uncertainty resulting 
from his decision to dissolve the legislature on april 29 and set 
new elections for july 24 
prem said he acted because dissident legislators in the main 
party of his coalition government voted against a governmentbacked 
bill to protect copyrights but the opposition charged that prems 
move was designed to avoid a noconfidence motion that had been 
scheduled for may 9 
dissolution of parliament automatically nullified censure motion 
the elections are expected to result in a substantial 
realignment of the political parties and it is uncertain if prem 
a former army commander who has been in office since 1980 will be 
returned to power 
bangkok newspapers today gave frontpage display to army chief 
gen chavalit yongchaiyudhs assertion on sunday that while the 
military was strong enough to do so there would be no coup attempt 
in prems absence 
but chavalit is regarded as a prem supporter and such talk in 
the thai media often has proven to be bluster 
there have been 15 successful and aborted coups and 14 general 
elections since 1932 when thailand converted to constitutional 
monarchy 
the nation newspaper said today that prem was seen off at the 
airport by top military officers including chavalit and 
government officials who assured reporters everything would go 
smoothly during prems absence 
prem is expected to make his appeal on cambodia in talks with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
said prasong soonsiri secretarygeneral in prems office 
our standpoints on the cambodian issue still differ greatly 
and the talks are aimed at narrowing and resolving those 
differences said prasong who accompanied prem on the trip 
the soviet union claims vietnam is a sovereign state and that 
it cannot order that country around such as in the case of 
cambodia he said but were convinced that once moscow stops 
giving aid to hanoi then vietnamese troops cannot hold on in 
cambodia 
the thais also hope some progress on the issue will be made at 
the forthcoming superpower summit vietnam has been stressing its 
desire for a political settlement and also has said it wants 
progress at the summit 
the soviet union is the main supplier of arms to vietnamese 
forces that invaded cambodia nine years ago and are battling 
guerrillas backed by thailand and other countries cambodia is on 
thailands eastern border and bangkok regards the vietnamese 
occupation as its major security threat 
prems agenda in the soviet union includes giving a speech at 
the moscow state institute of international relations and visits to 
kiev and leningrad 
he goes to finland on may 23 and is to hold talks on trade with 
president mauno koivisto and prime minister harri holkeri 
prem concludes his tour with a may 2528 visit to hungary at the 
invitation of prime minister karoly grosz

a plan to build a 3 billion replacement for 
denvers crowded stapleton international airport will be decided by 
voters in a special election tuesday with backers heavily 
outspending opponents 
the specific issue to be decided by adams county voters is 
whether to allow denver to annex an unincorporated 45squaremile 
site in the county 10 miles northeast of stapleton 
the airport is the first major one planned in the united states 
since dallasfort worth opened in 1974 it would replace stapleton 
the worlds fifthbusiest airport and could become the nations 
second busiest airport by the year 2000 based on federal aviation 
administration predictions 
the faa supports the new airport because stapleton is congested 
and is predicted to lead the nation in flight delays by 1996 
denvers budget for buying land and building the first phase of 
the airport by 1995 is 16 billion officials estimate a total 3 
billion will be spent to complete the project by 2020 
proponents say the airport would boost colorados ailing economy 
by providing jobs and development the industrial and commercial 
development would mean property tax relief for homeowners 
supporters say 
opponents contend jet noise generated by the airport would be 
unbearable for homeowners and say closing stapleton would be a 
waste of money they also say foul air and thundering jets could 
destroy the nearby 2700acre barr lake state park bird refuge 
the biggest push for the site east of the rocky mountain 
arsenal which is adjacent to stapleton has been by the adams 
county partners in progress the group has spent more than 825000 
in its attempt to persuade the 115000 registered voters to approve 
the annexation the group has the support of major business labor 
and government leaders 
most of the opposition has come from neighborhood groups 
ordinary people for a better adams county has led the effort 
spending 48600 according to campaign financial reports filed 
with the county clerks office 
the committee for a better airport another group opposing the 
proposal has spent 8000 and may spend 2000 more before 
tuesday said spokesman reuben espinosa 
proponents point to a study that predicts a new airport would 
generate 54000 jobs by 2010 
armed with this projection gov roy romer has staged his own 
campaign in the past few months romer has shared breakfast at 
restaurants around the county with potential voters 
theyre looking for somebody to believe said romer the 
thing ive added is to help them believe somebody i have 
credibility 
the antiairport side meanwhile picked up support recently 
when major hotels near stapleton criticized the plan they called 
it unnecessary and a waste of billions of dollars already invested 
at stapleton 
the airlines joined the squabble early questioning the 
timetable that proposes an opening by 1995 united airlines and 
continental airlines denvers two largest carriers say the new 
airport is not needed until later in the 1990s at the earliest 
they also have issued minor objections such as not being 
consulted about runway configuration and accused mayor federico 
pena of pushing the project to create jobs not because the 
airlines need it 
as a result of negotiations with county officials the proposed 
site was moved three times each time farther from denver the 
current site is 18 miles from downtown compared with stapletons 
seven miles 
thats why i felt it is important for denver to have a direct 
link why annexation is so important to me pena said 
both sides say voter turnout will be the deciding factor 
we think its going to be tight said bill kenyon 
communications director for partners in progress

a convoy of 1300 soviet soldiers 
today pulled out of the afghan capital and headed for home gunfire 
rang out in the distance during a farewell ceremony an ominous 
reminder that the civil war rages on 
president najib spoke at the ceremony for the departing troops 
the first contingent of soviet forces to leave under an 
international accord to end the soviet unions eightyear 
involvement in the war 
the 300vehicle convoy was the first of four from the 
northeastern city of jalalabad near the pakistan border it set out 
early sunday morning on the 88mile trip to the capital and has an 
additional 200 miles to go before reaching soviet soil 
in a speech at the rally najib referred to the troops as my 
dear friends who had helped his country at a time of life and 
death afghan forces now can defend the country on their own he 
said 
the afghan leader and his military commanders pinned medals on 
some of the 500 soviet soldiers who stood for two hours during 
review the medals are gold and are attached to a blue ribbon 
bearing the inscription from a grateful afghan people 
may your way be safe and your dishes tasty najib told the 
departing soviets 
military bands played and thousands of afghan soldiers and 
civilians waved flags 
gunshots could be heard in the distance apparently from clashes 
between the usbacked moslem guerrillas and progovernment forces 
meanwhile the leader of a moslem guerrilla faction vowed on 
sunday to seize jalalabad as soon as the rest of the estimated 
6000 soviet troops that were stationed there withdraw 
well continue our jihad holy war we are fighting against 
an idea said mahmood a commander in the radical hezbiislami 
guerrilla faction who spoke from his headquarters in peshawar 
pakistan 
soviet troops are expected to complete their retreat from 
jalalabad in two weeks and be replaced by up to 12000 afghan army 
troops 
mahmood said he had 10000 men under his command but could not 
predict when jalalabad a strategic city 45 miles from the pakistan 
border would be in guerrilla hands 
there will be a lot of army there it will need a lot of 
pressure mahmood said 
edmund mcwilliams deputy chiefofmission at the us embassy 
in kabul said sunday the insurgents have moved closer and stepped 
up their rocket attacks on the city the capital of nangarhar 
province 
it does not appear though at this point that the attacks 
will be affecting the pullout he said 
in the past month insurgents reportedly have overrun dozens of 
security posts in eastern afghanistan as soviet forces handed them 
over to afghan army troops 
the red army convoy arrived in kabul on sunday at the end of its 
daylong journey through mountains teeming with guerrillas 
officials said on sunday the convoy included 1200 men but today 
raised that figure to 1300 
on sunday the communist party leadership in moscow thanked the 
departing troops days of severe trials lie behind you said 
the party central committee address printed on the front page of 
the party daily pravda you have fulfilled the order of your 
homeland 
twenty western journalists were brought to jalalabad to ride 
with the convoy to kabul and during the night spent in jalalabad 
they heard heavy bombardment and felt the impact of a 
surfacetosurface missile that landed 90 feet from their hotel 
information about the start of the withdrawal was provided by a 
reuters news agency pool report associated press reporters were 
barred from covering the event soviet officials said the exclusion 
was the result of questions asked by the ap during a previous trip 
to kabul 
soviet troops and tanks moved into afghanistan on dec 27 1979 
to fight the anticommunist insurgency and replace one prosoviet 
government with another the united states has supplied arms to the 
insurgents 
about 115000 soviet troops are in afghanistan to bolster 
najibs forces but all must pull back to soviet territory within 
the next nine months to comply with unmediated peace accords 
signed in geneva last month 
half the troops are to leave by aug 15 under the agreement lt 
gen boris gromov told reporters on saturday that about onequarter 
of the soldiers would be home before president reagan visits moscow 
on may 29 
the soviets departure will leave najibs army of 50000 alone 
in its battle against about 200000 moslem insurgents the 
guerrillas have vowed to fight on to topple the marxist government 
guerrillas and western observers estimate that about 15 million 
afghans have died in the war the us state department estimates 
soviet casualties since 1979 at 33000 to 38000 more than 
onethird of whom were killed

security forces today stepped up pressure 
on sikh extremists holed up in the golden temple pounding two 
lookout towers with machinegun fire and incendiary bullets amid 
calls for the gunmen to surrender 
seven sikhs who surrendered on sunday were brought to the 
complex to appeal to comrades still inside the holy shrine the 
center of the sikh separatist movement 
the officers are good to us none of us have been troubled 
please come out with your hands in the air skatter singh pleaded 
over a loudspeaker set up on a rooftop 
there was no immediate response but sporadic shots were heard 
from inside the complex 
singh a member of the kalistan commando force one of several 
sikh militant groups that has offices in the temple complex has 
been in police custody since sunday 
sarabjeet singh deputy police commissioner said more than 50 
militants remained in the walled compound on the eight day of the 
siege he said at least 40 of them were inside the golddomed 
temples inner sanctum the holiest part of the shrine 
during a 2hour ceasefire on sunday 151 people surrendered 
including 18 women and eight children most of 125 men who 
surrendered are being detained but punjab state police chief 
kps gill said 17 were released today 
meanwhile sikh gunmen shot and killed 13 people in four revenge 
attacks elsewhere in punjab state united news of india reported 
today 
the extremists have killed at least 978 people in punjab this 
year in their quest for an independent homeland 
the recent victims included seven hindu laborers a sikh 
sorcerer and another sikh the others were not identified 
the siege at the golden temple was launched may 9 after 
militants in the complex opened fire on security force commanders 
who were inspecting the area outside the temples 20foot high 
walls five officers were injured 
four bodies were carried out of the temple sunday raising to at 
least 35 the number of people who have died since the siege began 
the dead included at least five noncombatants 
today bricks flew off the two towers as security forces blasted 
them with bullets from nearby rooftops this afternoon 
i think we will be here for quite some time said one 
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity we will have to 
starve them out or think of other alternatives 
food and other supplies have been cut off since the siege 
started but the militants routinely stockpile supplies in the 
complex which contains dining halls and kitchens 
intermittent gunfire was heard throughout the night as the sikh 
militants and the security forces traded shots

150 people 
police said that when he was recognized by security officers 
penta asked for a glass of water and swallowed a cyanide capsule 
he died at a hospital police said 
the government is reluctant to send troops into the 400yearold 
golden temple because religious sikhs would consider such an 
onslaught an intolerable desecration of their holiest shrine 
in 1984 prime minister indira gandhi sent the army into the 
temple to drive out sikh militants more than 1200 people mostly 
sikhs died in the raid 
less than five months later mrs gandhi was assassinated by two 
of her sikh bodyguards the revenge slaying set off antisikh riots 
in new delhi and other cities in which at least 2000 people died 
many of them innocent sikhs 
the sikhs whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam say they are discriminated 
against by indias hindu majority sikhs make up less than 2 
percent of indias 800 million people but are a majority in punjab

production at the nations factories mines 
and utilities shot up 07 percent in april the biggest gain in six 
months the government reported today 
the federal reserve said the april advance followed increases of 
04 percent in january and 02 percent in march and no change at 
all in february it was the largest advance since a 11 percent 
surge last october 
the increase was in line with expectations as economists had 
predicted a strong showing based on a pickup in production at auto 
factories 
autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7 million units last 
month up from a rate of 66 million units in march 
with the latest improvement overall industrial production is 
now 64 percent higher than it was a year ago a further sign of 
the resurgence of the us manufacturing sector which has enjoyed 
booming export sales because of the decline in the value of the 
dollar 
the reagan administration is counting on further reductions in 
the us trade deficit to contribute almost half of the expected 
growth in the overall economy this year 
the april advance in industrial output followed a period of 
generally sluggish activity in the first part of the year as 
production gains slowed while manufacturers particularly in the 
auto industry tried to work down an overhang of unsold goods 
still the production slowdown was much less severe than had 
been feared immediately after the october stock market collapse at 
that time some economists believed that a drop in consumer 
spending would force such steep cuts in production that the country 
would be pushed into a recession 
instead the overall economy expanded at a moderate 23 percent 
annual rate in the first three months of the year as measured by 
the gross national product 
the april report showed that output in the manufacturing sector 
climbed 07 percent in april reflecting an increase of 09 percent 
in the production of durable goods items expected to last three 
years or more and a 04 percent rise in nondurable production 
output in the mining industry jumped 13 percent in april 
following a 07 percent march increase the strong gains in both of 
those months followed a string of declines this sector which 
includes oil and gas drilling has been depressed because of 
falling oil prices 
output at the nations utilities fell 08 percent in april 
following an even larger 11 percent drop in march 
the various changes left the industrial production index at 
1356 in april up from 1347 in march

ousted gov evan mecham says he doesnt 
think his election as an arizona delegate to the republican 
national convention is a litmus test of his strength in the party 
this was not a referendum on me mecham said after 
saturdays state convention vote i am a unity candidate im 
trying to keep the party together 
many republicans hoped mecham would fade from the political 
scene after they voted to remove him at his impeachment trial last 
month but at the state convention the former governor who failed 
to be picked from his own congressional district ran successfully 
as an atlarge delegate 
he was not claimed by any presidential candidate 
hurrah mecham said when told of the results by reporters 
minutes before they were announced to the convention well for 
not being on a slate thats not too bad mecham came in 17th in 
the secret balloting for 18 atlarge seats 
his supporters burst into cheers applause and chants of we 
want ev when mechams name was announced 
all 33 delegates elected said they will support vice president 
george bush at the national convention in new orleans even though 
three delegates were elected from a conservative unity slate 
put together by the presidential campaign of pat robertson the 
former television evangelist is formally leaving the race today 
mechams stormy 15month governorship tore the state gop apart 
and former sen barry goldwater in a keynote address greeted by 
several standing ovations urged republicans to try to heal the 
wounds 
ive heard and ive read of people who want to seek vengeance 
upon those who failed to support our former governor in his 
hours of trauma goldwater said i hope that doesnt happen 
because if it does i can stand here and tell you that it will mark 
the end of the republican party in arizona for many many years 
goldwater had backed mecham during the 1986 campaign but later 
became one of his harshest critics 
mecham who was removed as governor by a senate court of 
impeachment is facing criminal charges in a trial due to start 
thursday he is accused of failing to properly report a 350000 
campaign loan 
if mecham is convicted of a felony by the start of the national 
convention it would be up to the national partys rules committee 
to decide whether he would be allowed to participate according to 
joe abate the state partys legal counsel 
us sen john mccain had said before the state meeting that he 
would be inclined not to attend the national convention if 
mecham was a delegate 
on saturday however mccain placed 10th in the atlarge 
balloting with 296 votes to mechams 271 and said he had decided to 
attend no matter what 
amazing he said of the vote i respect the decision of 
the convention i have no other comment about it

his home in a washington suburb on a busy day he was scheduled to 
see shultz defense secretary frank c carlucci and howard h baker 
jr the white house chief of staff at a luncheon hosted by 
israeli ambassador moshe arad 
a meeting on capitol hill with key members of congress and then 
a speech to the american israel public affairs committee the 
principal proisraeli lobbying group follow 
on tuesday peres has a formal session with shultz and then 
calls on president reagan at the white house 
israeli officials in washington noted that shultz met lest week 
in geneva with sovier foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
he may have something from the soviets on the mideast peace 
process said one israeli official who asked not to be identified 
but shultz told reporters traveling with him last week that he 
discerned no major change in the soviets position 
they want to play an influential role in the negotiations 
shultz and israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir are against the 
idea 
peres also met in recent days with soviet officials while 
attending a conference of the socialist international in madrid 
the official said 
also on the agenda for peres and shultz was discussion of 
shultzs june 3 trip to the middle east intended to breathe life 
into his plan for arabisraeli peace talks 
however the israelis are not expecting any great 
breakthroughs in his talks here which include a 30minute white 
house meeting on tuesday said the official

council as overseers of the talks the five are the united states

the incident occurred between feb 712 when a group of teenagers 
from a high school in southern israel was brought to a base near 
the west bank city of ramallah 
tsaban said the army put a military sergeant on trial for 
allegedly encouraging the beatings but that it was unclear whether 
the officer was punished 
i am demanding that this investigation be completed and that 
this story be taught in the schools so that it wont happen 
again tsaban said 
on sunday thousands of israelis attended ceremonies marking the 
21st anniversary of the capture of jerusalems arab sector 
prime minister yitzhak shamir vowed jerusalem would remain 
israels capital forever and said his government would never give 
up the territories occupied by israel in the 1967 middle east war

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that pregnant prison inmates have the right to free abortions if 
they cannot afford them 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments by 
prison officials in monmouth county nj that no such right 
exists if an abortion is unnecessary to preserve an inmates life 
or health 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled last nov 25 in a 
decision binding on all local state and federal prisons in new 
jersey delaware and pennsylvania that inmates have a 
constitutional right to even elective nontherapeutic abortions 
the appeals court barred enforcement of a monmouth county 
correctional institution policy that required inmates to get a 
court order allowing them to get a nontherapeutic abortion the 
policy also required the inmates themselves to pay for such 
abortions 
the challenged regulation fails to provide inmates with a 
meaningful opportunity to exercise their constitutionally protected 
right to choose to abort their pregnancies the 3rd circuit court 
ruled 
a 1973 supreme court decision legalized abortion based on the 
right of privacy the court said women have a fundamental 
constitutional right to choose to end their pregnancies 
but the court since has ruled that the federal government and 
states are not obligated to pay for even medically necessary 
abortions sought by women on welfare 
women behind bars present a special case because the high court 
has ruled that the constitutions eighth amendment banning cruel 
and unusual punishment requires prisons to provide adequate 
medical care 
in the new jersey case the appeals court ruled that a federal 
judge was justified in ruling that the inmates demonstrated a 
likelihood of success on their eighth amendment claim that denial 
of abortionrelated services constitutes deliberate indifference to 
a serious medical need 
the appeals court rejected the countys argument that its 
responsibility to an inmate requesting a nontherapeutic abortion 
is the same as its responsibility to one who wants a facelift for 
purely cosmetic reasons 
the 3rd circuit court stopped short of ruling that denial of 
abortion funding for inmates also is unconstitutional but it did 
order monmouth county authorities to pay 
county defendants shall assume responsibility for insuring the 
availability of funding for all inmate abortions if alternative 
means of funding are nonexistent the county must assume the full 
cost of all inmate abortions the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today prison officials said the 
eighth amendment clearly does not protect all medical needs the 
test is one of medical necessity not simply that which may be 
considered desireable 
the appeal warned against the somewhat anomalous situation of 
allowing a person who cannot otherwise obtain an elective abortion 
to obtain one by virtue of being temporarily confined in the county 
jail 
the case is lazaro vs monmouth county correctional institution 
inmates 871431

the supreme court today let stand the 
espionage conviction of a us spy agency employee who sold 
surveillance secrets to soviet agents 
the justices without comment turned away arguments that ronald 
w pelton was denied a fair trial when convicted of selling 
classified information about his agencys electronic eavesdropping 
programs 
pelton 46 worked for the national security agency for 14 years 
as a technician before quitting in 1979 prosecutors said he 
contacted soviet agents shortly thereafter 
following a federal trial in baltimore two years ago pelton was 
convicted of espionage conspiracy to commit espionage attempted 
espionage and unauthorized disclosure of classified information he 
was sentenced to three life terms plus 10 years 
pelton testified that the soviets paid him more than 35000 
over a period of years his activities were exposed by a soviet 
defector 
his conviction was upheld by the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals last dec 18 sparking the appeal acted on today 
in it peltons lawyers attacked the constitutionality of a 1978 
federal law the foreign intelligence surveillance act 
the law allows government agents to obtain court warrants 
authorizing wiretaps and other forms of surveillance with less 
proof of suspected wrongdoing than police generally are required to 
show before obtaining such warrants 
it is mr peltons position that the law is unconstitutional 
because it allows unreasonable governmental intrusion upon personal 
security contrary to the proscription of the fourth amendment 
his appeal said 
the constitutions fourth amendment bans unreasonable searches 
and seizures 
fbi agents secretly taperecorded conversations between pelton 
and the soviets with whom he was doing business 
although the supreme court has never ruled definitively on the 
1978 laws constitutionality three federal appeals courts have 
upheld it 
peltons appeal raised an alternate challenge to his 
prosecution it said that even if the 1978 law is valid it should 
not be allowed to authorize governmental investigations conducted 
primarily in contemplation of criminal prosecution 
the appeal contended that the law was designed only to help the 
government answer threats to the national security and not to 
help prosecute those who pose such threats

the supreme court in an important case for 
state treasuries today agreed to decide whether new jersey 
unfairly is forcing 13 major oil companies to pay millions of 
dollars in taxes 
the court said it will review a ruling that allows new jersey 
officials to deny state tax deductions for what the companies pay 
in federal windfall profits taxes 
lawyers for the oil industry mining interests and natural gas 
producers say the new jersey case could have broad impact in 
encouraging other states to adopt similar taxes 
reagan administration lawyers recommended that the high court 
review the new jersey case stating we have not ourselves come 
to a conclusion on the question 
the oil companies which operate numerous refineries in new 
jersey challenged a state business tax law that disallows a 
deduction for windfall profits tax payments 
the companies said the state tax is unfair because the windfall 
profits tax is based on oil production none of which takes place 
in new jersey 
the windfall profits tax was imposed after president carter 
announced he gradually would remove controls on domestic crude oil 
prices beginning in june 1979 the price controls were put in place 
by president nixon in 1971 
through the windfall profits tax the federal government seeks 
to recover billions of dollars in extra profit the oil companies 
realize by the jump in oil prices resulting from decontrol 
for example in mid1979 the controlled price of previously 
discovered oil was 586 a barrel and the price of newly discovered 
oil was 1306 a barrel the uncontrolled world price then was 
approaching 20 a barrel and would reach 30 a barrel before 
dropping dramatically in recent years 
the windfall profits tax is imposed on production at the 
wellhead rather than on net profits or income calculated on gross 
sales and net profits as measured at the pump 
the windfall profits tax which has produced more than 78 
billion in federal revenue will remain in effect until december 
1990 or until it yields 2273 billion in revenue 
the new jersey supreme court upheld the state tax last june 
saying it does not discriminate unfairly against the oil companies 
the oil companies paid an extra 885 million in taxes to new 
jersey from 1980 through 1984 because they were not allowed to 
deduct the windfall profits taxes 
the companies said six other states also disallow income tax 
deductions for windfall profits taxes they are georgia iowa 
minnesota new york south carolina and wisconsin 
the tax challenge was mounted by amerada hess atlantic 
richfield conoco cities service exxon phillips petroleum 
chevron mobil oil union oil of california gulf oil shell oil 
tenneco oil and texaco 
the cases are amerada hess vs division of taxation 87453 and

the supreme court today let stand rulings that 
denied the church of scientology of california federal taxexempt 
status for three years 
the court without comment turned away arguments that among 
other things stripping the church of its tax exemption for the 
years 197072 threatens the rights of all churches to proselytize 
through the sale of religious literature 
the religion of scientology was founded by l ron hubbard who 
died in 1986 
scientologists believe they can progress toward spiritual 
awareness through private sessions in which members skin responses 
to questions are monitored by an electronic device called an 
emeter which hubbard invented 
hubbards collective writings comprise the religions scriptures 
for the tax years at issue in this case the church of 
scientology of california was the mother church of all 
scientology churches in the united states 
the internal revenue service in 1957 officially recognized the 
church of scientology of california as a taxexempt religious 
organization but revoked that exemption in 1967 
in 1977 the irs told the church it owed 143 million in taxes 
and latefiling penalties for the years 1970 1971 and 1972 
the church sued the irs in us tax court which upheld the irs 
tax assessment 
the tax court ruled that under the internal revenue code the 
church was not entitled to taxexempt status for the three years at 
issue because some of the churchs revenues inured to the benefit 
of hubbard and his wife susan 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling last 
july 28 
the cumulative effect of hubbards use of the church to 
promote royalty income through sale of copyright materials 
hubbards unfettered control over millions of dollars of church 
assets and his receipt of untold thousands of dollars worth of 
debt repayments strongly demonstrate inurement the appeals 
court said 
the federal tax code gives taxexempt status to religious or 
charitable organizations if no part of the net earnings of which 
inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual 
payment of reasonable salaries to church officials doe not 
amount to inurement 
in the appeal acted on today the church argued that the appeals 
court ruling is an unconstitutional intrusion into churches 
internal affairs 
the case is church of scientology of california vs irs 871377

the supreme court today let stand an 
arbitrators reinstatement of an airline pilot fired for allegedly 
flying drunk 
the justices without comment refused to use the case of former 
northwest airlines pilot larry w morrison to study the power of 
federal courts to overturn labor arbitrators awards deemed 
contrary to public policy 
in deciding a case from louisiana last year the court adhered 
to previous rulings that limit severely such federal court power 
the court unanimously ruled that an arbitrators award may be 
overturned on public policy grounds only when the award creates an 
explicit conflict with laws or legal precedent 
last month the justices backed out of reaching a public 
policy grounds decision in the case of a postal service letter 
carrier reinstated after he was fired for failing to deliver more 
than 3500 pieces of mail 
in the pilots case morrison was fired for violating his 
employers policy against drinking alcoholic beverages within 24 
hours of flying 
a northwest pilot for 16 years morrison was given a blood test 
more than two hours after serving as a copilot on a jetliner 
flight carrying 79 people from las vegas to san francisco on aug 
1 1982 his blood alcohol level was enough to create a presumption 
of intoxication under california law 
morrison through the air line pilots association challenged 
his ensuing dismissal the challenge said he was fired without 
just cause because his misconduct was the unavoidable 
consequence of his alcoholism 
northwest allows reformed alcoholics to be pilots but the 
airline said morrison failed to seek help until his problem had 
endangered lives and so he had to be fired 
morrison has since completed a treatment program successfully 
the federal aviation administration has ruled him eligible to 
resume piloting commercial aircraft 
an airline arbitration board in 1984 ordered northwest to 
reinstate morrison but us district judge joyce hens green here 
reversed that ruling in 1985 
she said morrisons reinstatement would be contrary to public 
policy 
the us circuit court of appeals here reversed the trial 
judges ruling last year 
the appeals court interpreted a key 1983 ruling by the supreme 
court to mean that an arbitrators award contravenes public policy 
only if the award itself violates a law or compels unlawful conduct 
in seeking supreme court review northwest lawyers said the 
appeals courts ruling in morrisons case conflicts with other 
federal appeals court interpretations of the justices 1983 
decision 
northwests appeal argued that the ruling in morrisons case is 
based on a crimped view of the public policy exception created 
in the 1983 decision 
the case is northwest airlines vs air line pilots association

states may tax the costs of producing 
merchandise catalogs mailed directly to instate residents even 
when the catalogs are published in other states the supreme court 
ruled today 
the court unanimously rejected a department store chains 
attempt to avoid paying taxes for catalogs received by its 
louisiana customers 
writing for the court chief justice william h rehnquist said 
louisianas imposition of a use tax on catalogs produced for 
the new orleansbased dh holmes co does not interfere unduly 
with interstate commerce 
the louisiana tax structure does not discriminate against 
interstate commerce rehnquist wrote the use tax is designed 
to compensate the state for revenue lost when residents purchase 
outofstate goods for use within the state it is equal to the 
sales tax applicable to the same tangible personal property 
purchased instate 
the chief justice also noted that holmes with 13 department 
stores in louisiana initiated the catalog deliveries to improve 
its sales and namerecognition among louisiana residents 
he said the department store chains significant presence in 
louisiana provided what lawyers call the required nexus 
contact with the state to justify the tax 
there is nexus aplenty here rehnquist said 
the court rejected arguments that because holmes never actually 
possessed the catalogs it never really owned them and therefore 
should not be subject to the tax 
dh holmes co also operates stores in mississippi alabama and 
florida but 82 percent of its catalogs are mailed to about 400000 
louisiana customers 
the state tax imposed on holmes is based on 82 percent of the 
catalogs value the company paid more than 2 million to produce 
the catalogs for three years 
todays decision upheld state court rulings that the tax is 
valid 
the case is dh holmes co vs mcnamara 87267

conscious a sports official said today

said the condition of julissa gomez of blue springs mo 
remained almost unchanged since the may 5 accident 
he said she was receiving oxygen because she has been unable to 
breath regularly and that her arms and legs are paralyzed

saying it is too early to say whether she can recover from the 
injuries but since she is young she may have a chance

influence over trustees of the central states pension fund of the 
teamsters union the trustees lent glick 877 million in 1974 to 
buy and remodel his two casinos

the supreme court today refused to help a 
90yearold boston man who faces prison for refusing to testify 
before a federal grand jury reportedly investigating organized 
crime in new england 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by harry 
sagansky who said imprisonment could kill him 
sagansky twice convicted more than 20 years ago of illegal 
bookmaking was arrested last year in an fbi investigation of the 
underworld organization of the late raymond patriarca longtime 
reputed new england crime boss 
sagansky was held in contempt for refusing to testify before a 
grand jury after he was granted immunity from prosecution 
he has been ordered imprisoned until he breaks his silence 
supreme court justice william j brennan on feb 29 allowed 
sagansky to remain free pending review of his appeal 
federal prosecutors said sagansky would be incarcerated in a 
federal prison medical facility in springfield mo and said he 
would be flown there accompanied by a nurse to protect his health 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals rejected saganskys 
arguments that putting him in prison will endanger his health and 
could kill him 
a federal court must have the means to enforce its lawful 
order of contempt the appeals court said it added we must 
not lose sight of the fact that although the witness labels it a 
cliche argument it is nonethless true that the witness himself 
holds the key to his freedom the government is validly seeking his 
testimony not his confinement 
sagansky was imprisoned for 20 days in january after he refused 
to testify but then was released pending further appeals he also 
has said he has been the target of unlawful electronic surveillance 
by the fbi 
the case is sagansky vs us 871590

two 16yearolds helped pull their 
friends from a bus that burst into a fireball after it collided 
headon with a pickup truck on an interstate highway killing 27 in 
one of the nations deadliest bus crashes 
they were just laying down in the back door stacked up on top 
of each other and no one could get out cause they all fell down 
on top of each other said larry flowers who escaped from the 
bus and helped evacuate it with jamie hardesty i grabbed their 
arms and pulled 
a pickup truck going the wrong way on southbound interstate 71 
late saturday plowed into the right front side of the bus which 
was filled mostly with teenagers from the assembly of god church 
in radcliff returning home from an amusement park outing near 
cincinnati police said 
this morning five national transportation safety board 
investigators set to work one investigator went to the crash site 
and the probers also were interviewing witnesses and examining the 
wreckage from the crash which was brought to a national guard 
armory here 
the ntsb also requested to examine blood samples taken from the 
driver of the truck and to study both his and the bus drivers 
driving records said alan pollock an ntsb spokesman 
the investigators preliminary findings were expected to be 
discussed at a news conference this evening 
meanwhile in another part of the armory building other experts 
continued to examine the badly burned bodies of the victims 
comparing dental records and other clues in an effort to provide 
positive identifications 
nine of the 40 hurt sustained critical injuries four people 
were seriously injured including the driver of the pickup truck 
who was alone 
survivors said that as flames erupted in the bus front 
screaming passengers rushed toward the rear emergency door 
everyone started screaming and hollering said hardesty a 
high school sophomore everyone was trying to get off as fast as 
they could 
a passing truck driver patrick presley of dallas and an 
unidentified trucker rushed to the bus and yanked the rear door 
open 
hardesty was among the first to escape 
i thought maybe if i broke out the windows i could help some 
of them get out or at least let some of the smoke out he said 
i busted windows hoping they could get out but i dont guess 
they could 
when i jumped off the bus i saw him hardesty carrying 
somebody and laid them down and ran back up and was trying to get 
some more people said 17yearold juan holt 
he ripped off my shirt and he used it for bandages he 
put ice on people he was like a doctor 
jason booher 13 credited hardesty with saving a lot 
hardesty pushed burning victims from the bus and booher said he 
then rolled them in grass 
holt said hardesty and allen tennison 15yearold son of the 
churchs pastor directed paramedics to those seriously injured 
the church held two special services sunday 
the bus had been refueled with gasoline just before the 
accident said carroll county coroner james dunn the fuel tank on 
the 1977 ford school bus was on the right side and ruptured upon 
impact police said 
state medical examiner dr george nichols met with about 60 
family members in carrollton and told them he did not want them to 
view the remains 
the picture of their children in that room is not what 
they have in their memories or wallets he said 
nichols said 19 females and eight males were killed preliminary 
examinations of 22 bodies indicated the smoke inhalation as the 
cause of death he said he expected to finish the examinations 
today 
the victims apparently died trying to flee and the body of the 
driver was found near the steering wheel with a fire extinguisher 
between his legs nichols said 
a womans body was found facing the front door while the other 
bodies were headed toward the back of the bus 
as word of the accident spread distraught relatives clutching 
dental and medical records arrived here sunday to help identify the 
dead many came in a bus donated by fort knox a military 
installation near radcliff where most of the church members work 
officials said 
early sunday the hull of the bus with bodies still inside 
was moved to the national guard armory in carrollton 75 miles 
northeast of radcliff and 45 miles northeast of louisville 
state police trooper jim mudd said it was not known how long or 
why the pickup was traveling the wrong way 
its driver 34yearold larry w mahoney of worthville was 
listed in serious condition at humana hospitaluniversity of 
louisville 
what is believed to be the worst bus accident in us history 
occurred sept 17 1963 when a bus collided with a train near

the supreme court today upheld a 18 million 
judgment against an insurance company ordered to pay the money to 
an injured mississippi man whose 20000 claim it wrongfully 
rejected 
but in one of the most closely watched cases of the year the 
justices declined to decide the constitutionality of such enormous 
punitive damage awards in personal injury cases 
the court in a ruling based on procedural grounds said the 
issue was not properly presented in the case 
the justices did decide a lesser issue raised in the dispute 
upholding a mississippi law that imposed a 15 percent penalty 
243000 against the insurance company for unsuccesfully 
appealing the case to the mississippi supreme court 
the vote on that issue was 61 with justice harry a blackmun 
the lone dissenter justices john paul stevens and anthony m 
kennedy did not take part in the case 
the court left for another day the overriding question of 
skyrocketing damage awards a development that has touched off a 
wave of legislative activity 
some states reacting to soaring insurance rates have imposed 
ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal injury 
lawsuits 
any ultimate review of the question that we might undertake 
will gain the benefit of a welldeveloped record and a reasoned 
opinion on the merits said justice thurgood marshall for the 
court 
he said settling the issue now would shortcircuit a number of 
less intrusive and possibly more appropriate resolutions 
marshall said those possibilities include further action by the 
mississippi legislature or the courts of that state addressing the 
issue 
the case arose when lloyd crenshaw of pascagoula miss was 
repairing a car alternator in his garage in 1979 and part of the 
alternator fell on his right foot 
less than two weeks later surgeons amputated his leg below the 
knee after gangrene developed 
crenshaw 61 at the time worked at the white stores in 
pascagoula his employer had a group insurance policy with bankers 
life and casualty co 
a state jury ruled that bankers life acted in bad faith in 
denying crenshaws claim and awarded him 20000 in actual damages 
and 16 million in punitive damages 
the insurance company said the punitive damage judgment violates 
the constitution but that issue was not raised or passed upon by 
the mississippi courts 
bankers life also was ordered to pay an additional 15 percent 
243000 after it appealed unsuccessfully to the mississippi 
supreme court 
marshall said today that the 15 percent penalty is an 
appropriate deterrent to frivolous lawsuits 
three other states virginia kentucky and alabama have similar 
penalty laws 
the case is bankers life vs crenshaw 851765

the surgeon general declared today that 
nicotine is addictive like heroin and cocaine a finding that came 
as no surprise to researchers but which will provide new ammunition 
for antismoking forces 
the significance of the report by c everett koop is not that it 
unveils new scientific evidence but that he organized existing 
research into a systematic presentation lumping nicotine with 
heroin and cocaine as physiologically addictive substances 
careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettes 
and other forms of tobacco are addicting koop wrote in a 
preface an extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is 
the drug in tobacco that causes addiction 
moreover the processes that determine tobacco addiction are 
similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin 
and cocaine 
although his report places nicotine in essentially the same 
medical category as those two illicit drugs koop noted at a news 
conference that tobacco has a favored place in the united 
states and is not likely to be banned 
i dont think we are every going to get to a point in our 
society where we can bring about prohibition of tobacco he said 
i dont think this would be a practical solution i think we 
learned this during the prohibition on alcohol 
he said steps should be taken to protect children from being 
exposed to nicotine noting that 43 states already have laws 
albeit poorly enforced against the sale of cigarettes to 
minors 
i think we need a license to sell tobacco just they way we 
require one to sell alcohol said koop 
asked later where he would set the age on banning sales to young 
people the surgeon general noted that different states set 
different ages for such things as driving and buying alcohol and 
said that practice probably would continue with stricter 
antitobacco laws 
i would set it at about 75 added the 71yearold physician 
asked whether his new report might highten antagonism between 
smokers and nonsmokers koop said that would be hard to predict 
i think it would mean in general more sympathy for the person who 
cant quit that certainly is the position ive taken ever since i 
have been in this job you might get annoyed at people who smoke in 
your presense and make your eyes burn and your sinuses clog up and 
so forth but your anger has to be abated by the fact that these 
people are addicted to a drug and i think this will make people 
more tolerant of the problems a smoker faces when he is trying to 
quit 
the report says nicotine can be addictive no matter how it 
enters the body noting that socalled smokeless tobacco enters the 
blood stream through absorbtion in the mouth and that pipe and 
cigar smokers who do not inhale subject themselves to the same kind 
of absorbtion 
the report cites 171 separate studies most of them conducted 
during the past decade as references 
in a letter to congress accompanying the report health and 
human services secretary otis r bowen said a warning label on 
the addicting nature of tobacco use should be rotated with other 
health warnings now required on cigarette and smokeless tobacco 
packages and advertisements 
bowen said cigarette smoking is the chief avoidable cause of 
premature death in this country causing more than 300000 such 
deaths each year 
the disease impact of smoking justifies placing the problem of 
tobacco use at the top of the public health agenda bowen wrote 
the conclusions of this report provide another compelling reason 
for strengthening our efforts to reduce tobacco use in our 
society 
in his opening remarks koop also called for an addiction 
warning on cigarette labels and advertising and said treatment 
of tobacco addiction should be more widely available and should be 
considered at least as favorably by thirdparty payers as treatment 
of alcoholism and illicit drug addiction 
koop handled some other controversial ideas as questions 
with the evidence that tobacco is addicting is it appropriate 
for tobacco products to be sold through vending machines which are 
easily accessible to children 
is it appropriate for free samples of tobacco products to be 
sent through the mail or distributed on public property where 
verification of age is difficult if not impossible should the sale 
of tobacco be treated less seriously than the sale of alcoholic 
beverages for which a specific license is required and revoked 
for repeated sales to minors 
in the face of overwhelming evidence that tobacco is 
addicting policymakers should address these questions without 
delay koop said 
reaction was swift and predictable 
this report and the surgeon generals findings should compel 
federal and state authorities to treat tobacco as the addictivve 
drug that it is said dr alan r nelson chairman of the board 
of trustees of the american medical association 
nelson said federal and state authorities should raise the age 
of those allowed to purchase cigarettes to 21 ban the access of 
tobacco products through vending machines label tobacco products 
as addictive ban the advertising of tobacco products and regulate 
the development of new nicotine products 
although details of the report were not made public until today 
one of the many federal health officials that helped prepare it 
disclosed the essential finding that nicotine is addictive in a 
television interview earlier this month 
a tobacco institute spokesman walker merryman reacted to that 
disclosure by ronald m davis director of the federal office of 
smoking and health by saying it showed antitobacco zeal has 
overtaken common sense and good judgment 
in a statement today the tobacco institute said smoking is 
truly a personal choice which can be stopped if and when a person 
decides to do so the surgeon generals own public health service 
figures indicate that about 40 million americans are former smokers 
and that 95 percent of them quit smoking without help these 
figures and common sense contradict any claim that smoking is an 
addiction 
the institute said the report trivializes the serious drug 
problem faced by society the claim that cigarette smoking is a 
drug addiction similar to cocaine or heroin use or alcohol abuse 
is unfortunate and unwarranted the message to the american public 
is that using illegal drugs such as crack or heroin has the same 
risk of addiction as smoking 
koops last smoking report concluded again based on a 
compilation of existing studies that nonsmokers health was 
endangered by inhaling smoke from other peoples cigarettes 
issued just over a year ago that report has reverberated 
quickly throughout society providing impetus for a growing move 
toward smokefree environments in the workplace restaurants and 
public buildings the latest example the federal ban on smoking 
aboard commercial jetliners for flights of two hours or less that 
took effect april 23

presidential candidate jesse jackson 
appealed again today for fairness from the democratic party saying 
fairness is a reasonable expectation 
jackson has complained in recent weeks that his delegate total 
is not proportional to his hardwon share of the popular vote in 
primaries to date 
fairness is a reasonable expectation reciprocity is a 
reasonable expectation we expect to treat the party fair because 
we expect to be treated fairly by the party he told reporters 
here 
asked what he would do if he did not win the nomination jackson 
replied 
we hope to have enough popular vote and delegates for the 
nomination he said and then well determine the ticket of 
our party and the platform of our party and the priorities of our 
party 
jackson made a quick swing through new jersey sunday and today 
before heading to oregon for a final day of campaigning in advance 
of the states primary on tuesday 
on sunday under the massive dome of the hopewell baptist 
church jackson drew on religious themes of hope and faith as he 
vowed to keep up his campaign for the democratic presidential 
nomination 
weve come too far to turn around now he told the mostly 
black crowd in our own lifetime weve moved from the back of the 
bus to three steps from the white house 
jackson said he was the only candidate committed to sweeping 
economic reforms that would benefit working people 
this is not about black fish and white fish but about big fish 
and little fish jackson said to applause 
jackson called for raising the minimum wage working to bring 
womens wages in line with those of men earmarking defense funds 
to education instead and providing universal health insurance he 
also outlined plans for providing affordable housing and day care 
he attacked the reagan administrations foreign and domestic 
policies including vice president george bush the apparent 
republican nominee in each criticism 
jackson faulted the administration for a failed courtship 
with panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega and for allowing 
us companies to move out of the country in order to pay cheaper 
wages 
jackson appealed for votes in the new jersey primary which is 
june 7 
no valley is too deep when our minds are made up he said 
were winning every day thats what makes the new jersey race so 
important its a matter of pulling your weight in new jersey 
at the state democratic convention in south orange nj 
jackson noted pointedly that he unlike rival michael dukakis has 
garnered few bigname endorsements 
i havent inherited any voters ive earned every vote ive 
gained he said 
dukakis also appeared at the democratic event and the two met 
briefly

the supreme court in a ruling it acknowledged 
could make doctors reluctant to serve on peer review panels 
today restored an astoria ore surgeons 22 million antitrust 
award against fellow doctors in his city 
by an 80 vote the justices said a federal appeals court 
wrongly wiped out dr timothy a patricks victory 
patrick sued partners of the astoria clinic in 1981 alleging 
that they conspired to revoke his staff privileges at the citys 
only hospital because they resented his opening a private practice 
in competition against the clinic 
a federal jury awarded patrick 195 million against the clinic 
and three of its physician partners the presiding judge ordered 
the people patrick sued to pay his lawyers 228000 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals however reversed the 
ruling 
the appeals court ruled that because oregon law required doctors 
at astorias only hospital columbia memorial to maintain peer 
review of staff physicans their actions taken against patrick 
represented the kind of governmental action immune from federal 
antitrust law 
invoking what lawyers call the state action doctrine the 
appeals court threw out patricks victory 
but writing for the high court justice thurgood marshall said 
the state action doctrine does not apply in oregon because no 
state official reviews the doctors peerreview decisions 
because we conclude that no state actor in oregon actively 
supervises hospital peerreview decisions we hold that the state 
action doctrine does not protect the peerreview activities 
challenged in this case marshall said 
he said the justices are not unmindful of the policy argument 
that effective peer review is essential to the provision of 
quality medical care and that any threat of antitrust liability 
will prevent physicians from participating openly and actively in 
peerreview proceedings 
but marshall said congress not the high court must take care 
of that 
in the health care quality improvement act of 1986 congress 
insulated certain medical peerreview activities from antitrust 
liability 
under the law action by such medical panels escapes liability 
if it was taken in the reasonable belief that it was in the 
furtherance of quality health care 
but the law does not appear to immunize all peerreview actions 
from antitrust liability and it is not retroactive to patricks 
lawsuit 
if phsyicians believe that the act provides insufficient 
immunity to protect the peerreview process fully they must take 
up that matter with congress marshall said 
justice harry a blackmun who once served as general counsel to 
the mayo clinic in rochester minn disqualified himself from the 
case patrick vs burget 861145

rival shiite moslem militias today 
blasted each other with howitzers mortars and rockets in the slums 
of south beirut defying a syrian order to cease fire 
police said the syrianbacked amal militia staged a 
counterattack forcing the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of 
god to retreat from one section of the 16square mile shantytown 
during the last 10 days of combat hezbollah has pushed amal 
from large parts of the slums 
police said 14 people were killed and 120 wounded in the 
hostilities sunday and today raising the overall toll to 225 dead 
and 706 injured since fighting for control of the slums broke out 
may 6 
eighteen western hostages including nine americans are 
believed held in the slums by factions linked to the hezbollah 
police said syrian commanders had massed several thousand troops 
and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles around the main gateways 
into the labyrinthine slums today 
were ready to go in but zero hour hasnt been set yet 
said a syrian colonel commanding the main highway to the airport 
which was proclaimed reopened to normal traffic today for the first 
time in 11 days 
on sunday syrias military intelligence chief in lebanon brig 
gen ghazi kenaan ordered hezbollah and amal to lay down their 
arms 
our forces will shoot without hesitation any gunman on the 
street and in buildings your lives will be spared if you comply 
he said 
it was imperative for syria to take the decision to rescue the 
people from the bloodbath he told a news conference 
before the amal counterattack police said hezbollah had seized 
control of 90 percent of the slums hezbollah only held about 
onethird of the 16 squaremile area on may 6 it was not 
immediately known if amal secured any districts in todays 
counterattack 
radio stations reported that amals leader justice minister 
nabih berri had decided to withdraw his militiamen 
no gunmen should be allowed to remain in the suburbs and 
beirut now that a legitimate force is taking charge of security 
berri was quoted as saying in a reference to the syrian army 
hezbollah which has fielded 3000 fighters has not responded 
to the syrian plan but the fundamentalists spiritual leader

the soybean has an asiansounding name with 
its origins rooted in longago china and the peanut has a real 
american punch to its name raising images of baseball parks and 
street vendors 
but the united states is the leading soybean producer while 
china is a distant third behind brazil 
china meanwhile is the biggest peanut producer with india 
second and the united states third according to agriculture 
department analysts 
in all global production of oilseeds in 198788 is expected to 
be a record 2037 million metric tons up 5 percent from last 
season says the departments foreign agricultural service 
projections indicate output may rise further in 198889 
based upon various usda reports issued last week including the 
may 10 supplyanddemand projections for 1988 harvests the united 
states will continue to hold a comfortable lead in soybean 
production 
of the 2037 million tons of oilseeds produced in the world 
soybeans will comprise 1011 million tons or almost half the 
global harvest the us soybean share is more than 518 million 
tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of soybeans 
brazil the leading soybean competitor for american farmers is 
expected to provide 176 million tons chinas harvest was 
estimated at about 121 million tons with argentina next at 9 
million tons 
globally cottonseed is the secondrated oilseed at almost 307 
million tons of production in 198788 
china is the cottonseed leader at 71 million tons followed by 
the united states 523 million and the soviet union 449 million 
several of the remaining major oilseeds peanuts sunflowerseed 
and rapeseed are fairly close in production totals ranging from 
19 million to 23 million tons 
peanut production in 198788 is estimated at 193 million tons 
china leads with 617 million tons followed by india at 435 
million and the united states a distant third with 164 million 
tons 
in listing the remainder of the major oilseeds country rankings 
get a bit blurred because some of the usda figures are reported 
regionally instead of by individual countries 
for example the top producer of rapeseed clearly is china with 
production reported at 673 million tons but the secondranked 
producer is the 12nation trading bloc of the european economic 
community or eec shown at 592 million tons canada with 385 
million tons is third global rapeseed production was put at 229 
million tons 
a similar situation was shown for sunflowerseed the soviet 
union is easily the worlds leading producer with 608 million tons 
in 198788 while once again the eec comes in second with 373 
million argentina was third with 28 million tons forecast world 
output was reported at 203 million tons 
the united states did not appear at all in the rapeseed 
production figures and was listed at 118 million tons of 
sunflowerseed in 198788 
another oil source is flaxseed with a world output of 234 
million tons this season canada leads with 790000 tons followed 
by argentina 550000 and india 400000 the us production was 
reported at 190000 tons

us cotton inventories could show a modest 
rise in the 198889 marketing year if agriculture department 
projectons hold up 
although the departments first official estimate of 1988 cotton 
production wont be ready until august analysts say the harvest 
could be around 14 million bales down from almost 148 million 
bales in 1987 
with a modest decline in exports expected in the marketing year 
that will begin on aug 1 probably dropping to 6 million bales 
from 66 million this season and a drop in demand by domestic 
textile mills total us cotton use is expected to decline by 
about 1 million bales in 198889 
thus despite the projected smaller harvest the us cotton 
inventory by aug 1 1989 could grow to 62 million bales from 55 
million forecast as the carryover this aug 1 
globally the same thing is happening department projections 
put the worlds cotton production in 198889 at 835 million bales 
and total consumption at 82 million bales

the supreme court ruled today that seven 
mechanics at a wolmelsdorf pa factory are entitled to two years 
not three back overtime pay 
the courts 63 decision resolves conflicting lower court 
interpretations of a provision of the federal fair labor standards 
act 
the law currently sets for covered employees the minimum wage of 
335 it also generally requires employers to pay one and onehalf 
times an employees regular rate for overtime hours those in 
excess of 40 per week 
the labor department sued the richland shoe co in 1984 
contending that it had been violating the federal labor law by not 
paying overtime until a mechanic had worked at least 48 hours in 
any week 
the seven mechanics primarily were responsible for repairs and 
maintenance of equipment at richlands plant which makes footwear 
and other leather products 
under the federal law a lawsuit seeking unpaid overtime 
compensation is subject to a twoyear statute of limitations but a 
threeyear deadline is authorized for a willful violation of 
the overtimepayment requirements 
in other words workers wrongly deprived of overtime pay may be 
able to collect two years or three years worth of back overtime 
payments after suing their employer 
us district judge daniel h huyett ruled that richlands 
violation of the fair labor standards act had been willful he said 
that determining willfulness requires nothing more than that the 
employer has an awareness of the possible application of the 
federal law 
the new orleansbased 5th us circuit court of appeals 
previously had announced such a standard for determining 
willfulness under the labor law 
but the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
reversed that portion of huyetts ruling that awarded the mechanics 
three years of back overtime pay 
the 3rd circuit court said the richlands violation of the law 
could not be ruled willful unless it was shown that richland knew 
it was doing so or displayed a reckless disregard for whether it 
was violating the law 
that ruling seemingly meant the mechanics were entitled to two 
not three years worth of back overtime pay 
writing for the high court today justice john paul stevens said 
the 3rd circuit courts interpretation of willful is the correct 
one 
the standard that the employer either knew or showed 
reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was 
prohibited by the statute is surely a fair reading of the plain 
language of the act stevens said 
justices thurgood marshall william j brennan and harry a 
blackmun dissented they said the 5th circuit courts 
interpretation should be adopted 
the case is mclaughlin vs richland shoe co 861520

a fire broke out today aboard one of five 
tankers damaged in an iraqi air raid on irans larak island oil 
terminal 
a pentagon spokesman in washington meanwhile said the wreckage 
of a us helicopter had been found along with the bodies of its 
two crewmen 
the aircraft was reported missing in the persian gulf after a 
battle last month in which us forces sank or disabled six iranian 
ships 
officials were still trying to determine today how many people 
died in the iraqi raid saturday on the larak terminal in the strait 
of hormuz at the southern end of the gulf 
the attack set fire to the spanish supertanker barcelona the 
cypriotflag tanker argosy the liberianflag supertanker seawise 
giant british tanker burmah endeavour and the iranian tanker 
khark 
the seawise giant and the argosy were badly damaged in fires 
that raged out of control for many hours the burmah endeavour and 
the khark sustained minor damage officials reported 
the barcelona was beached to prevent it sinking although the 
fire aboard it appeared to have been extinguished sunday it 
reignited and iranianled salvage teams were fighting the flames 
today according to gulf shipping executives who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit said the 
bodies of 16 of the seawise giants crew have been recovered one 
seaman was killed aboard the barcelona and two crewmen were killed 
aboard the argosy it said three crewmen remained missing from the 
barcelona 
but gulfbased shipping executives said only one crewman aboard 
the seawise giant was killed with three missing and that one man 
aboard the barcelona was killed with three other crewmen missing 
the iraqi raid the third on larak in seven months was aimed at 
throttling irans economic lifeline its oil exports to force 
tehran to the negotiating table and end its 7yearold war with 
iraq 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus on sunday quoted a senior 
iranian air force officer as saying the us navy aided the iraqi 
warplanes attacking larak by jamming iranian radar and radio 
communications for nine minutes 
us officials said us warships patrolling the gulf were not 
involved with the larak raid 
the bodies of the two us marine corps pilots and the wreckage 
of their helicopter were located in the southern persian gulf on 
sunday the pentagon said nearly a month after they disappeared 
during usiranian clashes 
in washington lt col keith schneider a pentagon spokesman 
said the bodies of capt kenneth hill 33 of thomasville nc 
and capt stephen leslie 30 of new bern nc were recovered from 
the marine corps ah1 cobra 
air force lt col charles manicer a spokesman for the us 
central command said the remains of the gunship will be destroyed 
in place rather than pulled out of the water he said he did not 
know when the wreckage would be blown up 
pentagon officials said the initial report from navy divers in 
the gulf indicated they had yet to spot any battle damage on 
the wreckage of the helicopter that would prove it crashed after 
being hit by gunfire or a missile 
so far there is no discernible evidence of battle damage 
said one official who insisted on anonymity but theyre still 
going over it as best they can 
leslie and hill were the only american casualties in the 
fighting april 18 when us naval forces destroyed two iranian oil 
platforms and sank or disabled six naval craft iran said at the 
time that its forces shot down the helicopter 
tehran said 44 iranians were killed during the clash 
the fighting began after us forces earlier that day destroyed 
two iranian oil platforms in retaliation for a mine explosion in 
the gulf four days before that damaged the uss samuel roberts and 
wounded 10 sailors 
the navy had officially called off the search for the helicopter 
and declared the men killed in action the wreckage was located by 
a chartered salvage tugboat in the general area where the clashes 
occurred salvage experts said

a book preservation technique developed by the 
library of congress shows promise but alternatives should be 
considered also according to a study by the federal office of 
technology assessment 
acids in the types of paper used to print books over the last 
century or so threaten to destroy the volumes some in as little as 
50 years according to the study made public last week 
chemists working for the library developed a system using 
diethylzinc vapors to remove this acid from books the study said 
this has worked successfully 
however diethylzinc is a dangerous chemical which bursts into 
flame on contact with air the pilot plant where it was made was 
destroyed by fire and it would have to be used in a specially 
enclosed environment filled with nitrogen gas ota said in its 
study prepared for congress 
on the plus side dez vapors permeate closed books so it can be 
used to process large numbers of books stacked together 
but the study adds since the development of the dez process 
the library has done very little to look into alternatives 
although two other book deacidification systems also are under 
development those alternatives may merit consideration the report 
said 
ota which is an analytical agency serving congress said the 
acid in modern book paper causes brittleness and eventual crumbling 
of the paper already the agency says 25 percent of the librarys 
14 million books are too brittle for regular use 
books can be copied onto magnetic tape microfilm or optical 
discs but those are more costly and more difficult to use than 
paper volumes the study said 
while chemical treatments can stop books from becoming more 
brittle they do not repair damage that already has occurred and 
the library is working on a process for strengthening already 
damaged paper 
the eventual solution the report added would be use of 
acidfree paper in book printing that is being done for between 15 
percent and 25 percent of books published currently

if peace ever returns to the mountains 
and deserts of afghanistan the warravaged country will require 
one of the most massive reconstruction efforts since world war ii 
the first stage will be the relocation of about 3 million afghan 
refugees from pakistan and 2 million from iran western observers 
believe that 4 million more afghans are refugees inside their own 
country 
anthony land head of the peshawar pakistan office of the un 
high commissioner for refugees said the return will be the largest 
human migration in the organizations history 
inside afghanistan 10 years of civil war between the communist 
government and moslem insurgents the last 8 years with soviet 
military involvement have left much of the country in ruins 
pakistanis western diplomats guerrillas and refugees seem to 
agree that even if the fighting stops in afghanistan the country 
will never be the same 
gulbaddin hekmatyar chairman of the sevenparty guerrilla 
alliance based in pakistan estimated that 60 percent of the houses 
in afghanistan have been destroyed along with an equal percentage 
of arable land 
the whole country is in ruins said the guerrilla leader 
canals and irrigation systems are badly damaged or destroyed 
hekmatyar said the afghans ability to restore the irrigation 
systems will be crucial to avoid mass starvation once the refugees 
return 
un agencies and several countries have started making plans 
for afghanistans reconstruction but they say it is too early 
gauge the projects exact size or expense 
one of the first and most dangerous tasks will be clearing mines 
planted or scattered across the countryside by sovietafghan 
aircraft 
us diplomats estimate there may be 3 million of them the 
guerrillas say the number is closer to 55 million 
then comes what officials predict will be a massive infusion of 
emergency food and shelter medical supplies seeds and farm 
implements 
some officials believe that fields left fallow under years of 
blazing sun will be too hard to be worked by the afghans 
traditional wooden plows 
few officials care to venture what all this will cost but the 
un high commissioner for refugees jeanpierre hocke recently 
mentioned a figure of 300 million western diplomats in islamabad 
have guessed up to 15 billion dollars 
when the refugees return is anybodys guess but several 
interviewed in the camps of pakistans northwest frontier province 
said they wont venture back until all soviets are gone and the 
marxist kabul government has fallen 
i will go first and see what is left of my home and my farm 
said isayal ghairad 34 who lives with his wife two daughters and 
son in the sunbaked munda no 6 camp a halfhours drive from 
peshawar 
he said he will not send for his family until he is certain he 
can feed and house them 
un and pakistani officials agree they wont see the refugee 
exodus begin until after next springs thaw 
a squabble has already broken out over which government the 
reconstruction aid should be channeled through the existing kabul 
regime islamabad or the guerrillas who are creating a government 
of their own 
looking at afghanistan we see no efforts of any kind from the 
other side for preparations to receive refugees said a pakistan 
foreign ministry spokesman speaking on the usual condition that he 
not be named 
kabuls own foreign ministry spokesman responded with his own 
broadside broadcast by official radio kabul 
these groundless allegations which are being made in order to 
mislead public opinion are far from the truth and are counted as 
another design for creating obstacles in the way of the return of 
the refugees the radio quoted him as saying 
he said the measures taken were political social and 
economic but he gave no details

ptl expected to file a revised 
reorganization plan in us bankruptcy court this afternoon that 
essentially puts the 200 million 2200acre evangelical empire on 
the auction block officials said today 
ptl wants to sell heritage usa in fort mill or at least enough 
of it to pay off its debts and then lease the property required to 
carry on its church and network television ministries according to 
a draft of the plan 
several proposed buyers already have surfaced including george 
shinn a sports entrepreneur from charlotte nc 
judge rufus reynolds ordered ptl last month to devise an orderly 
plan of liquidation of its assets to pay its debts the ministry 
had failed to raise enough money to meet its operating expenses and 
pay the first installment of its debt as specified under the 
original reorganization plan filed in december 
under the revised plan reynolds would appoint a board of three 
businessmen possibly headed by ptl vice president mc red 
benton to preside over ptl as a selfliquidating trust said david 
west ptl director of public relations 
ptls assets including a hotel and convention center a water 
park a residential development and about 1700 acres of 
undeveloped land a few miles south of charlotte are worth an 
estimated 160 million to 200 million the organizations debts 
are estimated to range between 75 million and 130 million 
whatever money or property remained after debts were paid would 
go back to the nonprofit arm of the ministry heritage ministries 
which would operate the church and television network the 
spokesman said 
the charlotte observer reported sunday that several groups 
apparently are planning to compete with shinn in bidding on 
heritage usa the newspaper reported that at least one group of 
creditors dubious about shinns willingness to provide upfront 
cash in his bid to buy ptl is seeking a buyer more to its liking 
another offer is expected from a new salt lake city corporation 
tango trading co the company whose principals include former ptl 
vice president dale hill has announced that it will submit a bid 
to buy heritage usa 
ptl has been in financial straits since founders jim and tammy 
bakker left the ministry last year amid a sexandmoney scandal

federal prisoners are entitled to inspect 
substantial portions of their presentence investigative reports 
prepared by the government the supreme court ruled today 
the 53 ruling in two cases from california was labeled a 
bombshell by dissenters who said it may trigger a flood of new 
requests for government reports under the freedom of information 
act foia 
chief justice william h rehnquist wrote the majority opinion 
denying sweeping authority sought by the reagan administration to 
withhold presentence reports from prisoners 
rehnquist said the governments privilege against disclosing 
some confidential information does not apply with the same force 
when the request for files is made by the subject of the report 
rather than someone else 
federal laws speak so strongly against the existence of a 
privilege on the part of the government when the request is from 
the subject of the report that we think it accsed from that which may be 
withheld will be 
timeconsuming and expensive 
officials also argued that giving the information to inmates 
will have a chilling effect on individuals questioned by 
investigators who fear their identities will be dislcosed 
the case is us vs julian 861357

former television evangelist pat robertson having won 
republicans attention but few delegates abandoned his 
presidential bid today and said he hoped george bush would win this 
year and again in 1992 jesse jackson still in the democratic race 
though trailing badly renewed his call for fairness in choosing 
delegates 
meanwhile a new poll showed democrat michael dukakis ahead of 
republican bush in a trial heat between the likely nominees nearly 
six months before the general election according to a harris poll 
dukakis was favored by 50 percent of likely voters who were 
surveyed bush was supported by 43 percent and 7 percent were 
undecided 
the survey of 2138 people had a 3 percentagepoint margin of 
potential sampling error 
robertson who had not been a major gop contender for two 
months ended his campaigning officially in a brief meeting with 
reporters in front of his home on the grounds of cbn university in 
virginia beach va 
he had dropped his operating control of the christian 
broadcasting network to run for president and said today he would 
resume the leadership of cbn tomorrow 
today i suspend my candidacy for the republican nomination in 
1988 but i do not now nor will i ever suspend my advocacy of 
conservative and moral principles he said george bush has won 
the nomination i applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorse 
his candidacy 
he said he had filed incorporation papers for americans for the 
republic a group to be used as a rallying point for future 
political action but he said of his own possible candidacy in 
1992 that remains a moot question until the 1988 election i 
hope mr bush is elected and then reelected again in 1992 
jackson at a breakfast appearance today in newark nj called 
again for party officials and other super delegates to support 
him in greater numbers taking into account his support in 
primaries this year and also his past efforts helping other 
democratic candidates and bringing in new voters 
we hope to have enough popular vote and delegates to win the 
nomination he said but win or lose he added fairness is a 
reasonable expectation reciprocity is a reasonable expectation we 
expect to treat the party fair because we expect to be treated 
fairly by the party 
jackson and dukakis will face off tuesday in the oregon primary 
with 45 delegates at stake 
an upbeat dukakis addressing democrats in new jersey on sunday 
declared i smell victory in the air but jackson turning a 
tale of pride and perseverance into a campaign parable urged 
college students in virginia keep hope alive 
following what has become a pattern in recent contests jackson 
was engaging in primaryeve campaigning today while dukakis was 
home in massachusetts devoting the day to gubernatorial business 
up until today robertson was the sole republican remaining in 
the race against bush pete du pont alexander haig jack kemp and 
bob dole all fell by the wayside as bush rolled up an 
insurmountable lead 
the vice president clinched the delegates needed to nominate 
last month in the pennsylvania primary and got president reagans 
formal endorsement last week 
robertson who has 46 delegates to bushs 1344 finally faced 
facts last week he told reporters then he was backing bush and 
would make his own exit official today he was expected to turn his 
delegates over to bush at the republican national convention this 
summer 
robertson had not been considered a serious contender since 
super tuesday march 8 when his bid to make a strong southern 
showing fizzled abysmally 
the former television evangelist had come out swinging in the 
first real campaign contest in iowas muchwatched caucuses on 
feb 8 he stunned the bush forces with a secondplace finish 
behind dole but ahead of the vice president 
robertson soldiered on even after it became obvious that the 
nomination was out of his reach he encouraged his backers to seek

the supreme court ruled today that americans 
have no right of privacy to their garbage once its put out for 
collection 
by a 62 vote the justices reinstated drugdealing charges 
against two california residents police discovered evidence of 
narcotics in their garbage 
the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes 
from vidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by 
any member of the public said justice byron r white for the 
court 
it is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at 
the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals 
children scavengers snoops and other members of the public 
white said 
the fourth amendment to the constitution generally requires 
police to obtain search warrants from a judge before conducting 
searches 
but white said the constitutional protection does not apply to 
discarded trash because people have no expectation of privacy 
for their garbage 
in a dissenting opinion justice william j brennan said 
scrutiny of anothers trash is contrary to commonly accepted 
notions of civilized behavior i suspect therefore that members 
of our society will be shocked to learn that the court the 
ultimate guarantor of liberty deems unreasonable our expectation 
that the aspects of our private lives that are concealed safely in 
a trash bag will not become public 
he was joined by justice thurgood marshall 
joining white were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices john paul stevens harry a blackmun sandra day oconnor 
and antonin scalia 
justice anthony m kennedy the newest member of the court did 
not take part in deciding the case 
todays ruling overturned decisions by california courts that 
said police officers must obtain warrants before searching 
discarded garbage 
police sifted through garbage collected from outside the home of 
billy greenwood in laguna beach calif on april 6 and may 4 1984 
they found drug paraphernalia and drug residue and then obtained 
a warrant to search greenwoods house 
there they seized marijuana hashish and cocaine and charged 
greenwood and dyanne van houten who was also present with 
narcotics possession 
state courts threw out the charges after ruling that police 
violated the rights of greenwood and ms van houten 
the state courts relied in part on a 1971 california supreme 
court decision that said residents of the state have an expectation 
of privacy in their garbage 
the effect of that ruling was overturned by proposition 8 a 
1982 initiative law known as the victims bill of rights in 
which california voters approved the use of police evidence unless 
it was obtained in violation of federal restrictions 
the supreme court today said the initiative law does not violate 
the us constitution 
in other action the court 
let stand a ruling that pregnant prison inmates have the right 
to free abortions if they cannot afford them 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments by 
prison officials in monmouth county nj that no such right 
exists if an abortion is unnecessary to preserve an inmates life 
or health 
ruled that federal prisoners are entitled to inspect 
substantial portions of their presentence investigative reports 
prepared by the government 
the 53 ruling in two cases from california was labeled a 
bombshell by dissenters who said it may trigger a flood of new 
requests for government reports under the freedom of information 
act 
upheld a 18 million judgment against an insurance company 
ordered to pay the money to an injured mississippi man whose 
20000 claim it wrongfully rejected 
but in one of the most closely watched cases of the year the 
justices declined to decide the constitutionality of such enormous 
punitive damage awards in personal injury cases 
the court in a ruling based on procedural grounds said the 
issue was not properly presented in the case 
restored an astoria ore surgeons 22 million antitrust 
award against fellow doctors in his city 
by an 80 vote the justices said a federal appeals court 
wrongly wiped out dr timothy a patricks victory 
agreed in an important case for state treasuries whether new 
jersey unfairly is forcing 13 major oil companies to pay millions 
of dollars in taxes 
the court said it will review a ruling that allows new jersey 
officials to deny state tax deductions for what the companies pay 
in federal windfall profits taxes 
let stand the espionage conviction of a us spy agency 
employee who sold surveillance secrets to soviet agents 
the justices without comment turned away arguments that ronald 
w pelton was denied a fair trial when convicted of selling 
classified information about his agencys electronic eavesdropping 
programs 
let stand rulings that denied the church of scientology of 
california federal taxexempt status for three years 
the court without comment turned away arguments that among 
other things stripping the church of its tax exemption for the 
years 197072 threatens the rights of all churches to 
proselytize through the sale of religious literature 
the garbage case is california vs greenwood 86684

the federal communications commission has 
exclusive authority to regulate the technical quality of cable 
television signals the supreme court ruled unanimously today 
the court rejected arguments that state and local officials 
should be allowed to impose more stringent requirements for cable 
tv 
the commission acted within the statutory authority conferred 
by congress when it preempted state and local technical standards 
governing the quality of cable television signals said justice 
byron r white for the court 
the fcc has divided cable services into four categories the 
first consists of cable channels that deliver signals of television 
stations that are normally broadcast through the air 
the other classes include cable channels such as cable news 
network and espn pay channels such as home box office and 
channels with twoway capability that allow subscribers to return 
information to the channel control point 
the us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that the fcc 
has exclusive control over the signal quality of the first class of 
cable channels the appeals court also ordered the fcc to develop 
standards for assuring the quality of the signals in the latter 
three categories 
the first part of the appeals court ruling was appealed to the 
supreme court by the national league of cities new york city 
officials and other communities 
they said state county and city governments should be allowed 
to impose signal quality standards for cable channels that carry 
television broadcast stations 
the supreme court ruled today that a 1984 federal law does not 
bar the fcc from preempting such authority from state and local 
governments 
the justices said the statute endorses a dual system of cable tv 
regulation giving local officials power to award franchises but 
leaving control over technical quality of cable signals with the 
fcc 
cable systems operate in more than 18500 communities 
the fcc said giving local control over technical matters could 
impede the growth of cable tv by imposing overly burdensome 
requirements and would subject cable operators to a patchwork of 
different rules 
the challenge to the fccs power by new york city and the 
national league of cities was supported by officials from miami 
wheaton ill dallas scottsdale ariz st louis montgomery 
county md and sacramento calif 
the case is new york city vs fcc 87339

greed drive and ambition

should have more spiritual experience

principle he said adding the reality of a big country like

george bush today labeled as old news a 
newsweek magazine report that his national security adviser was the 
washington contact for a contra armssupply operation bankrolled 
with drug money 
that is the oldest tiredest reporting bush said while 
touring a research center here that is old news id hate to 
think it is politically motivated material you get sick and tired 
of saying ive told the truth you get bombarded by these 
insinuations and tired stories 
the magazine reported sunday that arms dealer richard j 
brenneke had said in a sworn deposition to a senate foreign 
relations subcommittee that donald gregg was the washington contact 
for the enterprise called arms supermarket 
bush campaign spokesman pete teeley said sunday he believed the 
allegation had been raised before and that gregg had said he had 
not spoken with brenneke gregg has denied that teeley said 
bush said today of teeleys response i think pete teeley put 
it in great perspective yesterday its just pure unadulterated 
ive got to watch my language 
bush also implied that sen john kerry dmass chairman of the 
subcommittee that brenneke testified before leaked the information 
to newsweek 
if sen kerry and that committee of his have any allegations 
to make against anybody who works for me or against me i would 
think they would have the courtesy instead of going with these 
nameless stories to stand up and say what they are he said 
bushs office told the magazine that brennekes story was just 
rumors and the same old regurgitated stories we thought wed put to 
rest long ago 
newsweek quoted unidentifed senate staffers as saying they had 
confirmed part of brennekes story from an agent with israels 
mossad secret service and from former panamanian consul jose 
blandon but are still assessing brennekes credibility 
arms supermarket supplied the nicaraguan rebels during the 
congressional aid cutbacks of 198486 before the irancontra 
operation set up by national security council aide lt col oliver 
north the magazine said 
it involved cia arms merchants mossad agents the intelligence 
arm of the honduran military and members of a colombian drug 
cartel according to newsweek 
brenneke an oregon businessman with connections in the soviet 
bloc has done work for both mossad and the cia the magazine said 
newsweek quoting unidentified government sources public 
records about the irancontra affair and the subcommittees 
investigation reported that brenneke also said the medellin 
cocaine cartel put up financing for the operation used its planes 
to fly arms to the contras and then used the same planes to fly 
some of its drug shipments from colombia to the united states 
panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega granted transit 
privileges for the flights and took a cut of the profits blandon 
testified at the committee hearings according to newsweek 
the magazine did not say how much in arms reached the contras 
it said the arms supermarket had been phased out by august 1986 
with 20 million of arms left unsold in warehouses in honduras 
according to newsweek in a july 12 1985 notebook entry 
recently released by the irancontra joint committee north 
predicted a bad end for the arms supermarket 14 million 
to finance came from drugs he wrote the magazine said

president reagans chief spokesman said today 
he cannot predict when us discussions with panamanian officials 
might lead manuel antonio noriega to give up power 
i cant comment on any course of action spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said although he backed away from characterizing us 
discussions with noriega as pleabargaining 
fitzwater said he had used the term last week as had white 
house chief of staff howard baker want to repeat it 
the administrations reported willingness to drop us drug 
trafficking indictments in a deal to get noriega out of power has 
been widely criticized by members of congress us att but he did notorneys 
and 
law enforcement groups 
fitzwater said today that reagan certainly is aware of the 
criticism of proposals to dismiss indictments brought against 
noriega in miami and tampa fla but refused to discuss the 
strategy for dealing with the panamanian strongman 
we cant say what the give and take is he said we cant 
predict time for noriegas departure we cant discuss what they 
are talking about what the options are and how long it will ommittee has 
some evidence that 
wrongdoing on the part of us officials in panama is behind the 
administrations efforts to dismiss the indictments 
but he said obviously we dont have enough that weve seen 
fit to make it public or that we feel that we should talk about 
publicly and i havent for that reason 
sen alfonse damato rny a member of the appropriations 
subcommittee on defense and foreign operations disagreed with the 
reports that noriega had some information on us wrongdoing 
the fact is that thats electionyear politics damato said 
on cbstvs face the nation 
president reagan meanwhile was asked sunday on his return to 
the white house after a weekend at camp david md whether a deal 
had been struck with noriega i cant comment he said 
reagan administration officials have said they were plea 
bargaining with the panamanian military chief and de facto ruler 
about possibly dropping the drug indictments 
a top state department official michael kozak has been engaged 
in secret negotiations with noriega in panama administration 
sources said last week that the military chief was told that if he 
left panama for a year perhaps in august the indictments would be 
dropped 
attorney general edwin meese iii on friday presented arguments 
to reagan against dismissing the charges according to us 
attorney leon kellner of miami a prosecutor who obtained one of 
the indictments 
on sunday robert merkle another us attorney who secured 
indictments against noriega said that a deal with noriega would 
make it impossible for me to maintain any credibility not only in 
my own community it will make it difficult for me to look my 
own kids in the eye and tell them to just say no to drugs 
i would probably begin to say just say maybe because this is 
the sort of equivocation i think which is absolutely 
unacceptable he said

115000 troops are scheduled to leave by august and the rest by 
february 
fitzwater said the withdrawal was a welcome first step in the 
afghan peoples desire for independence and self determination 
as the soviets leave we remain confident that a broadbased 
government chosen by the afghan people and not imposed from outside 
will replace the kabul regime the spokesman added 
asked if the administration believes soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev will pull out all his troops fitzwater responded in the 
affirmative

archbishop desmond tutu of south africa on monday 
renewed his call for increased us pressure to end apartheid in 
his country 
what must still happen to prompt the american government to 
act tutu asked repeatedly in a commencement address at emory 
university 
all the things you hold dear in this land are undermined 
destroyed held in small account in south africa he told the 
graduates 
tutu dismissed arguments that economic sanctions against south 
africa only hurt black south africans questioning the motives of 
those who suddenly decide they feel sorry for black people 
tutu further criticized us news coverage of south africa 
especially since the government there moved to limit coverage of 
protests 
media in this land with a few notable exceptions have shown 
extraordinary timidity tutu said he said american readers do 
not see the newspaper stories which appear in south africa 
detailing the injustices of apartheid 
tutu also made an apparent reference to a controversy at emory 
over the dismissal last fall of a black professor who was denied 
tenure supporters of the teacher sondra oneal demonstrated on 
the campus sunday and distributed fliers monday protesting alleged 
racism at the school 
tutu said emory has a good record of seeking racial justice 
in the united states and around the world 
one would want to be equally concerned about similar issues 
here he added it is critical for this institution with 
which i am honored to be associated to show a zeal to eradicate 
something which could be a stumbling block 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize received an honorary 
doctor of divinity degree during the commencement program

seventyfive hunters won a lottery monday 
to participate in new hampshires first moose hunt since 1901 
i wont be hunting moose but ill be out there in the 
woods said a disappointed bernard durant who was among a dozen 
hunters who watched as a computer selected the winners from 5900 
applicants 
the random selection at fish and game department headquarters 
gives 65 residents and 10 outofstate hunters a chance to shoot 
one of the animals 
fish and game officials proposed the threeday hunt to manage 
the herd conservatively estimated at 1600 the population has 
rebounded after being decimated in the late 1800s 
opponents contend the hunt is being allowed simply to satisfy 
hunters moose are so docile that shooting one is like shooting a 
parked car they claim 
fish and game officials say the animals appear tame on the 
roadside but are cagey in the woods howard nowell chief of game 
management research denies the state was pressured by hunters 
new hampshires house this year killed legislation aimed at 
stopping the hunt after a colorful debate that included a moose 
call by one lawmaker meant to rally support for the hunt 
opponents were not nearly as vocal as those in neighboring maine 
when that state introduced a moose hunt in 1980 maine then studied 
the issue for a year before voters overwhelmingly approved an 
annual hunt beginning in 1982 in maine 1000 hunters are chosen 
by lottery and opposition has virtually ceased 
six other states hold annual moose hunts alaska montana 
idaho north dakota utah and wyoming minnesota has one every 
other year oregon colorado and washington also have allowed moose 
hunting

other activities befitting a town where the high school sports 
teams are the fighting ducks but duck racing is the event that has 
captured imaginations 
the racing ducks will zip down wireenclosed 16foot runways 
while the birds run handlers are allowed to encourage them by 
crawling along a ramp above the runway and making any kind of noise 
they figure will motivate their racers 
but if the verbal encouragement rolls off their birds backs 
handlers are stuck the rules say that once started a duck cant 
be touched 
the taylor competition is being patterned after the great

of racing ducks and up to 20000 spectators have gathered

no one ever accuses michael dukakis of being 
a spellbinding campaign speaker but every once in a while the 
democratic presidential frontrunner comes up with a line that 
makes ears perk up 
perhaps energized by a crowd of more than 2000 people at a 
weekend street market here his biggest crowd in some time 
dukakis found words that managed to meld a multitude of his themes 
in three sentences he reminded voters of the reagan 
administrations ties to panamas accused drugtrading gen manuel 
noriega of its reported attempt to cut a deal dropping noriegas 
federal indictment and of dukakis entirely unrelated call for a 
law requiring notice to workers before companies close plants and 
at the same time he took a swipe at expected republican opponent 
george bush 
i understand the vice president was in portland dukakis 
said and i understand that he said he thought the president 
ought to veto the new trade bill because it contains a provision 
that gives american workers 60 days notice before theyre thrown 
out in the streets 
this from an administration thats apparently prepared to give 
noriega 90 days notice before they work out a deal 
his staff was pleased as punch i know a new line when i hear

dukakis raised the issue of charisma 
hes often accused of a severe charisma deficiency and he tries

the whole idea nags at him 
he sometimes contends that at least his wife kitty finds him 
charismatic and passionate standing before a small group of 
democratic activists gathered for poolside cocktails dukakis took 
the claim another step 
weve had a lot of discussion in this campaign about 
charisma he said well out here they think im charismatic 
right 
he was met with silence then chuckles 
recovering he invoked his ethnic roots 
anyway he said charisma is a greek derivative

with all the talk of nancy reagan and astrology dukakis has 
developed his own interest in the subject 
putting away his staffs concerns that california might prove 
the wrong place to do it dukakis poked fun at the reagans by 
referring to the stars 
i dont know a horoscope from a telescope he said often 
he would add that he had decided to learn and had taken a 
reading of the stars for himself and attorney general edwin meese 
iii 
in both cases it says were going to be changing positions

on friday the 13th the dukakis campaign was beginning to wonder 
if perhaps there might be something to the stars and superstitions 
arising in a fashionable hotel just off san franciscos union 
square dukakis campaign trip director jack weeks was chagrined to 
find there were no buses to take the two busloads of traveling 
press in the motorcade to the morning campaign event 
there was a difference of opinion over who was to blame but 
weeks quickly made a call to a local cab company and the 
reporters photographers and network crews were soon piling into a 
fleet of taxis and heading off to a high school in the citys 
suburbs 
one group from a television network proved luckier than the 
rest they managed to hail a long black limo

dukakis trip to the west was his first with secret service 
protection he was the last presidential candidate to accept the 
government bodyguards and their arrival brought new rules and 
restrictions to dukakis entourage 
campaign staffers began sporting new lapel pins of a unique 
design that signal to the informed who the wearer is 
they also began spouting new phrases and words like sweep the 
bags which doesnt mean clean them but assures the luggage is 
unarmed and nonthreatening and eod which staffers explain as 
an impenetrable acronym for the guys who do the sweeping 
were learning a new language press secretary mark gearan 
said

one year after the uss stark was attacked by a 
friendly iraqi jet fighter american ships in the persian gulf 
continue to operate under wartime rules of engagement designed to 
prevent a repetition of that tragedy 
the ground rules for fighting have been modified several times 
since the stark was attacked on may 17 1987 primarily to expand 
the number of situations in which american warships may come to the 
aid of merchant ships 
but the first change to the rules made by the pentagon after the 
attack which killed 37 seamen was to authorize ship commanders to 
open fire on any plane or vessel that came close enough to fire on 
their ship and those guidelines remain in place 
there are really two us navies one for peace and one for 
war dr michael vlahos the director of the state departments 
center for the study of foreign affairs observed recently the 
difference is mental readiness 
in war ones senses are honed for battle in peace even 
where the threat of inadvertent attack is considered ones 
senses must be leashed vlahos said 
that peacetime leashing may have left the starks crew 
mentally disarmed vlahos argues 
the starks crew knew for an hour that a jet fighter was flying 
in their direction and that it was assumed friendly assumed 
iraqi 
no effort was made to warn the plane away until it was too late 
the fighter fired two exocet missiles 30 seconds apart the first 
was a dud the second nearly sank the ship 
one year later the stark sits dockside at ingalls shipbuilding 
in pascagoula miss receiving the finishing touches of an 
overhaul that will cost an estimated 100 million the careers of 
two of her officers including the skipper have come to a forced 
end 
iraq has acknowledged its fighter pilot mistakenly fired on the 
stark thinking it was a tanker carrying oil for archenemy iran 
iraq has pledged to make restitution although no money has changed 
hands and probably wont for years 
more than twodozen us navy ships now operate in and around 
the gulf escorting us tankers as well as 11 kuwaiti oil tankers 
reregistered to fly the american flag the convoy work began 
despite congressional opposition spawned by the stark incident 
us ships also are now cleared to come to the aid of neutral 
merchant vessels in certain circumstances four different battles 
have been fought with iranian forces and the administration is 
vowing to protect the right of freedom of navigation indefinitely 
the navy meantime long ago came to the conclusion the ships 
officers should have prevented the stark tragedy noting that no 
ordnance was fired in defense of stark or in retaliation for the 
attack a board of inquiry concluded 
the rules of engagement that were in existence on may 17 
1987 were sufficient to enable stark to properly warn the iraqi 
aircraft and if the warning was not heeded to defend 
herself against hostile intent and imminent danger without 
absorbing the first hit 
the ships commander capt glenn r brindel failed to 
provide combatoriented leadership allowing starks antiair 
warfare readiness to disintegrate to the point that his combat 
information center team was unable to defend the ship the board 
added 
brindels tactical action officer lt basil e moncrief 
failed to defend stark as his duty required 
brindel and moncrief ultimatley accepted responsibility for the 
starks failure to defend itself and were reprimanded rather than 
courtmartialed brindel was allowed to retire at the lower rank of 
commander and moncrief was allowed to resign without a pension 
brindel now a realtor in virginia beach refuses to discuss 
that night in any detail he refers reporters to a letter he wrote 
the newspaper navy times last november blaming the failure to 
defend the ship on deficient radar and electronic sensor equipment 
brindel says hes bitter the navy investigation didnt touch on 
that aspect of the affair but adds there were a lot of good 
things that came out of it too like improving damage control on 
the ships in the gulf the identification of each others forces 
rules of engagement those sort of things 
indeed more extensive damage control training and equipment 
additions have been cited as reasons the crew of the uss samuel b 
roberts saved that frigate after it hit a mine in the persian gulf 
last month

the supreme court today made it easier for 
people to file jobdiscrimination charges against employers by 
allowing flexibility for meeting some deadlines imposed by a 
federal antibias law 
the justices by a 53 vote agreed with the reagan 
administration and revived a colorado sex discrimination case that 
was dismissed because deadlines for filing the complaint were 
missed 
the complaint was filed by suanne leerssen of aurora colo who 
was fired on june 10 1983 by commercial office products co 
ms leerssen filed a sex discrimination complaint against the 
company with the federal equal employment opportunity commission 
289 days later on march 26 1984 
the 1964 civil rights act says generally such charges must be 
filed with the eeoc within 180 days of the occurrence of the 
alleged discrimination but the law also gives someone charging job 
bias up to 300 days to file with the eeoc if the proceedings 
initially are instituted with a state or local civil rights agency 
in a related provision the law says no charge may be filed with 
the eeoc for 60 days from the time the case is filed with a state 
or local civil rights agency that provision is intended to give 
the agency time to resolve the dispute while the eeoc steps aside 
colorado civil rights officials previously had agreed with the 
eeoc that in effect the federal agency did not have to wait for 
the 60 days to expire before intervening in cases like that of ms 
leerssen 
most states have similar worksharing agreements with the eeoc 
the state agencies initially process certain types of claims and 
the eeoc initially handles others 
but the 10th us circuit court of appeals ruled that despite 
the statefederal agreement the eeoc must wait the full 60 days 
before intervening 
adding 60 days to the 289 days ms leerssen had waited to take 
action against her employer meant that the eeocs hands were tied 
until 349 days had elapsed from her firing and that is too late 
for the eeoc to meet the 300day limit the appeals court said 
the supreme court today overturned the appeals court ruling 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said the 
300day deadline was not missed because the eeoc had tacit approval 
to act immediately without waiting 60 days he said colorado 
officials had waived the 60day waiting period under their 
agreement with the eeoc 
the reagan administration had said the 10th circuit court 
ruling if adopted nationwide could have forced dismissal of 
thousands of discrimination complaints on a technicality 
the case is eeoc vs commercial office products co 861696

michael dukakis and george bush within sight 
of nomination and the end of their own fundraising needs are 
turning their attention to retiring the debts of onetime rivals 
and raising money for their parties 
bush has agreed to a request from senate republican leader bob 
dole to help pay off his debt said bush deputy finance director 
fred bush doles debt stood at 18 million as of the end of 
march but he has received some 600000 in federal matching funds 
since then 
within two weeks bush will send out a mailing to his 15000 
topdollar contributors seeking funds for the kansas senator said 
the treasurer who is not related to the vice president 
on the democratic side such fundraising will be done under the 
auspices of the democratic party not the dukakis campaign 
although dukakis will participate in any events said his treasurer 
bob farmer former opponent albert gore jr has the largest debt 
outstanding at more than 15 million 
governor dukakis respects and likes the other candidates 
farmer said but added i think that because there are still 
delegates outstanding we would not want anyone to think we were 
trading delegates for money it would be more appropriate if 
democratic party chairman paul kirk put the thing together 
democratic national committee spokesman mike mccurry said no 
date has been set for the unity fundraiser 
in the vice presidents case fred bush said the dole mailing 
shows good faith on the vice presidents part i think the 
dole people will help us as well 
he said there had been no request for help from the campaign of 
rep jack kemp rny whose treasurer scott mackenzie said the 
campaign expects to pay all of its remaining bills by the end of 
june 
however the campaign still needs to raise money for closedown 
costs and compliance with federal election commission regulations 
which will come to under 1 million said mackenzie 
if we could get the vice president to do a unity function or 
sign a letter to his contributors on our behalf that would 
certainly help mackenzie said in a telephone interview 
both dukakis and bush are beginning to refocus their 
fundraising machines on helping their parties build warchests for 
the november general election 
the candidates each will get 46 million from the 
taxpayersupported federal fund to campaign for the general 
election and cannot spend more than that amount 
but election law also allows the parties to spend 83 million 
to help their nominees and they can also finance statebased 
efforts which indirectly help the presidential ticket 
with events last month bush raised the maximum 27 million that 
primary candidates are allowed to spend under election law 
he plans to help the gop raise the 83 million plus another 
14 million that will go to state election funds for november said 
fred bush 
he said more than 1 million has already been raised for that 
effort and four large fundraising events at 10000 per couple 
are planned for june they should bring in between 4 and 5 
million 
farmer said the dukakis fundraising team of 30 will embark on 
general election efforts after hitting the 27 million primary 
ceiling next month 
farmr who has overseen dukakis admirable finance effort will 
remain as treasurer and if dukakis wins the nomination as expected 
will work with the party to raise funds for both the presidential 
campaign and for such state efforts as voter registration local 
races and other partybuilding activities 
noting that the republicans traditionally have had millions more 
to spend than the democrats farmer said my goal would be to 
create a level playing field for democrats and republicans and 
raise as much as it takes to win 
farmer said if dukakis is the nominee he anticipates expanding 
on the system he used to raise money for dukakis in the primary 
season a network of 950 finance committee members who each 
pledged to raise 10000 
seven hundred raised the 10000 each and 150 raised 20000 or 
more he said 
traditionally people went out and found a few fatcats and 
depended on them to raise money we have tried to create a 
grassroots effort all over the country farmer said 
in addition farmer said he foresees helping to raise money for 
the democratic senatorial campaign committee the democratic 
congressional campaign committee and the democratic gubernatorial 
bids

stringtown examined the freed hostages about 10 inmates who had 
taken hostages were checked and loaded on a bus for transfer to 
other prisons officials said 
shortly after the bus pulled out of the prison parking lot at 
1120 am an oklahoma highway patrol tactical team packed up its

was not racially motivated he admitted however that a dispute 
about theft of property reported as the cause of the riot 
apparently involved black and white inmates

not involved in the hostage taking and remained in their cells 
during the standoff remained inside the prison 
they will be contained stripped fed and watered she said

reached early this morning in negotations involving the inmates 
prison officials and legislators

inmates that three state legislators the convicts met with sunday 
would witness todays surrender massie said

one inmate and one guard sustained minor injuries during the 
takeover of the overcrowded mediumsecurity mack alford 
correctional center 
under the agreement the inmates were to let the hostages go 
after a bus arrives to take them away then come out of the 
dormitory where they have been holed up since late friday ms 
trammell said 
the bus to take the inmates to another prison arrived outside 
the center at 820 am but did not immediately enter the prison 
grounds

state lawmakers the inmates late sunday released prison capt 
lewis mcgee 
hes tired hes in good health hes glad its over with

be unharmed

cigarettes at their request said corrections spokeswoman joy 
hadwiger temperatures in the area sunday were in the low 90s 
the inmates also demanded restoration of electricity and 
meetings with reporters and an american civil liberties union 
attorney who has helped prisoners ms trammell said officials did 
not say if those demands would be met 
in addition to corrections officers an 18member highway patrol 
tactical unit and as many as 40 other patrol officers kept watch on 
the prison 
on sunday afternoon two inmates took one hostage yoder 
outside for less than 10 minutes and talked to officers through a 
fence yoder was used as a shield by inmates who worked to close a 
hole in the fence cut by prison officials to help other inmates 
surrender she said 
she said the hostagetakers told the 30 to 35 other inmates 
locked in the occupied south dorm that their lives would be in 
danger if they tried to leave ms trammell said however that 
those inmates said they didnt feel like hostages 
the insurgents hung sheets with messages written on them from

the united states welcomed the withdrawal 
monday of soviet troops from afghanistan and renewed its pledge to 
support moslem rebels as they fight to take control of the kabul 
government 
the resistance has made clear its intention to continue the 
struggle for selfdetermination against the illegitimate kabul 
regime the state department said as we have said we fully 
support the resistance and their goal of an independent 
afghanistan 
the statement did not make clear whether the united states 
supported the rebels in a civil war with the prosoviet government 
or also in attacks on red army forces as they depart from the 
wartorn country 
the soviet commander lt gen boris gromov said saturday in 
kabul that the russians would defend themselves against rebel 
attacks certainly the retribution will be severe he said 
the afghan rebels have stockpiled us weapons including 
shoulderfired stinger missiles while the soviet have armed the 
afghan army president najib has denounced the rebels who are 
called freedom fighters by the reagan administration as 
terrorists and barbarians and fanatics who laughingly 
preach a holy war 
on monday a convoy of 1300 soviet soldiers left kabul and 
headed for home gunfire rang out in the distance during a farewell 
ceremony an ominous reminder that the civil war rages on 
gen gromov said saturday that a quarter of the soviet troops 
would be pulled out of the country by the end of the month an 
estimated 115000 soviet troops are in the country backing the 
government against the guerrillas 
state department spokesman charles e redman said we welcome 
the start of the withdrawal this is a historic occasion 
opening up the possibility for the early restoration of 
afghanistans independence and selfdetermination 
he said he hoped all soviet forces would be withdrawn well in 
advance of the feb 15 deadline set in agreements signed by 
afghanistan pakistan the united states and the soviet union 
the us official made a point of the fact the rebels had not 
signed the ceasefire accord redman also stressed the continuing 
and frequent us contact with the mujahedeen 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said in a separate 
statement that us support for the guerrillas remains 
steadfast 
the leader of a moslem rebel faction vowed on sunday to seize 
jalalabad a major strategic city as soon as an estimated 6000 
soviet troops withdrew 
well continue our jihad holy war we are fighting against 
an idea said mahmood a commander in the radical hezbiislami 
guerrilla faction who spoke from his headquarters in peshawar 
pakistan 
soviet troops are expected to complete their retreat from 
jalalabad in two weeks and be replaced by up to 12000 afghan army 
troops 
guerrillas and western observers estimate that about 15 million 
afghans have died in the war the us state department estimates 
soviet casualties since 1979 at 33000 to 38000 more than 
onethird of whom were killed in eight years of fighting 
an estimated 29 million afghan refugees are in pakistan and an 
estimated 23 million are in iran

pope john paul ii today began a 
threeday visit to paraguay last stop on his south american tour 
his jet touched down in a torrential rainstorm as drenched 
schoolgirls in white smocks chanted a greeting 
president alfredo stroessner who has ruled this nation for 34 
years awaited the pontiff inside an airport boarding area 
protected from the rain 
john paul who on departure from rome on may 7 called his 12day 
trip to uruguay bolivia peru and paraguay a mission against 
hate violence and lies arrived at 130 pm aboard a dc8 
jetliner of perus state airline aeroperu 
gen stroessners government tried last week to alter the papal 
schedule in paraguay by canceling a meeting with opposition 
leaders a move the vatican said was unprecedented 
the government later backed down but the papal visit has 
spotlighted deteriorating ties between the roman catholic church 
and the rightist government whose members often describe clerical 
critics as communists and subversives 
in turn clerics frequently attack alleged government 
corruption election fraud and human and civil rights violations 
the church has criticized the decision to allow only 
statecontrolled radio and television to cover papal activities in 
paraguay where about 97 percent of the 38 million population is 
catholic 
in peru on sunday night the pope called for an end to political 
violence that has claimed 10000 lives in recent years 
may your homeland be a place where exploitation violence 
and terrorism do not leave their tragic sequels of oppression and 
death john paul told a group of intellectuals and businessmen in 
lima perus capital 
the pope spoke in a catholic seminary where last week leftist 
guerrillas seeking the overthrow of perus civilian president alan 
garcia interrupted a mass and called for an armed revolution 
in a farewell speech in lima this morning the pope reiterated 
his concern over perus growing political violence 
i cannot silence the sadness that invades my pastors heart on 
confirming that this noble peruvian nation continues to suffer the 
lash of violence 
attacks and crimes continue to leave pain and death in so many 
homes of this country he said 
when john paul first visited peru in 1985 he appealed to 
leftist insurgents to put down their arms but the violence is 
worse than ever 
he recalled that appeal this morning 
before leaving this beloved soil of peru i renew the call i 
made in february 1985 to those responsible for so much pain and 
death 
officials said leftist insurgents were responsible for four 
dynamite blasts in lima on saturday that preceded the popes 
arrival there were no reported injuries but the explosions 
knocked out electricity in a large section of the city 
at a mass sunday in a park on outskirts of lima the pope 
appealed to an estimated 15 million peruvians to build a 
civilization of love 
a civilization which resting on this foundation of love for 
the person who is near us our neighbor will transform the 
whole world he said 
during a meeting with perus bishops he spoke of the blind 
and insensitive violence plaguing the nation perus poverty and

officials said monday an investigation had been 
launched into reports that an israeli teenager in a paramilitary 
youth corps severely beat an arab prisoner after being encouraged 
to do so by an army sergeant 
the incident reportedly occurred in february but details were 
only published monday 
the daily hadashot printed an interview with a 16yearold yuval 
aflalo from the southern town of yeroham yuval was quoted as 
saying he felt great enjoyment after beating an arab prisoner 
to a pulp with a wedge of iron the prisoner required 
hospitalization 
i tell you if i had had a submachine gun in my hands at that 
moment i would have killed him the teenager was quoted as 
saying 
about 100000 israelis of high school age belong to the gadna a 
paramilitary youth corps its members are taught to use weapons 
navigate and camp in preparation for entering the army at 18 for 
three years compulsory service 
hadashot said the teenager from yeroham was one of 60 high 
school students from the towns gadna corps who spent a week at an 
army base near ramallah in the west bank in february 
education minister yitzhak navon said on israel radio that a 
sergeant at the ofer camp near ramallah invited three gadna youths 
to come and see arab detainees 
navon said only two of the teenagers went along and one ran 
away when he saw the prisoners 
only one teenager was left apparently the sergeant 
encouraged him to strike how many times i dont know for that 
there is a committee investigating navon said presuming that 
the details are correct then this certainly is a grave affair 
col uri manos who heads the gadna said the youth quoted in 
hadashot exaggerated his role 
but he said the army was probing allegations that a soldier at 
the base took two other teenagers to the detention center and that 
one of them may have struck a prisoner 
meir tsaban a lawmaker of the socialist mapam party who 
revealed the incident to israeli newspapers said in a telephone 
interview that he learned of the incident in march after teachers 
at yeroham high school said they heard students boasting about 
participating in beatings 
tsaban said the army told him it had put a sergeant on trial for 
the incident and had issued orders barring the youth corps from 
being brought to bases in the west bank where arab prisoners are 
held tsaban didnt name the sergeant 
tsaban said he decided to publicize the case because he felt the 
army investigation had been inadequate the probe was 
unsuccessful and it was not even clear whether the sergeant was 
punished he said 
the haaretz daily quoted reservist troops who recently 
compeleted duty in the occupied territories as complaining that 
physical abuse and harassment of arabs has become the norm 
in keeping with army policy the newspaper did not publish the 
names of the complaining soldiers it said harassment ranged from 
strip searches to beatings and vandalizing homes 
the newspaper quoted one of its reporters who witnessed an 
incident sunday at the el amari refugee camp near ramallah 
according to the witness soldiers beat a detainee although he 
did not resist arrest and that one soldier threw a stone at the 
detainees mother as she pleaded for his release

pattern for an industrywide pact 
the union set a strike deadline of noon tuesday for 11 goodyear 
plants in nine states 
mike stanley president of urw local 878 in union city tenn

noblesville ind russellville ark and its tire headquarters in 
akron 
no new talks have been scheduled urw and firestone spokesmen 
said

pattern set in the tentative goodyear contract 
they did not present to us the costofliving allowance 
provisions goodyear granted and there was no provision in there 
for fully paid hospital insurance said urw president milan stone 
we believe that our proposal contains a number of 
improvements and in terms of firestones position in the industry 
is equal in value and in cost to the urw settlement proposal 
george w aucott the companys executive vice president said in a 
statement 
the third of the nations big three tire makers uniroyal 
goodrich tire co came to terms last month in a contract allowing 
for the companys special needs as a result of the recent goodrich

raise in the pattern agreement which included job security 
provisions 
fiftyfour percent of goodyears urw members rejected the 
tentative contract on may 1 six of the 11 goodyear locals approved 
the pact but they did not represent a majority of the the

of 45 people who made off with a total of 4500 
extra from a bank cash machine that went berserk last month just 
two have volunteered to return any of the money 
i was surprised they did come in and very happy they were 
going to give me the money right away amelia saavedra the 
branch manager of the savings and loan that was hit for the loss 
said monday 
i was very surprised pleasantly surprised to say the least 
those two were told to keep the money in their accounts so it 
could be automatically deducted when they are billed according to 
robert nolan a spokesman for first federal savings and loan 
association of rochester 
the associations branch at first avenue and 14th street spewed 
forth the money on april 24 as users of the cash machine called 
their friends to alert them that when 5 bills were requested 20 
bills were given 
i called everybody i knew an unidentified writer told new 
york newsday at the time 
the cash machine transactions are automatically recorded so the 
association has a record of everyone who mistakenly received the 
20 bills each of the 45 people who got extra money has had or 
will have the money deducted from their accounts nolan said 
to my knowledge we have had no protests nolan said monday 
the bank branch is part of a network that dispenses cash for 
other banks so the network will credit first federal once the 
accounts cough up the lost money 
an employee of the bank had mistakenly put a canister of 20 
bills into the slot for 5 bills theoretically the most a 
customer could get was 800 if he asked for 200 
the clerk who loaded the machine incorrectly will not be 
disciplined or reprimanded 
it was an innocent chain of human events nolan said and 
procedures have been instituted to prevent it from happening again 
the profiteering customers will not be prosecuted and there is 
no investigation under way into the matter according to colleen 
roche a spokeswoman for the manhattan district attorneys office 
meanwhile nolan said the bank could stand the temporary loss 
were a 47 billion association nolan said i dont 
believe it affected the cash flow

attorney general edwin meese iii has fired 
chief justice department spokesman terry eastland and the head of 
meeses speechwriting unit abruptly quit today after eastlands 
dismissal was announced 
william schambra the no 3 official in the public affairs 
office handed in his resignation after eastland told a reporter 
todays my last day i dont have a job 
in a letter eastland said that he had been relieved of his 
duties because he had provided an inadequate defense of the 
attorney general in the face of a yearold criminal investigation 
of meese 
meese meanwhile said of eastlands dismissal basically i 
decided this was a good time for a change in leadership this was a 
matter basically of my determination that for the rest of the year 
we could use some new leadership and he was agreeable to that 
meese also told reporters he was very pleased with eastland 
and felt he had done an excellent job meese said that 
eastlands deputy patrick korten would become the new head of the 
departments office of public affairs 
schambra would not discuss his resignation with reporters but 
gary l mcdowell himself a former meese speechwriter himself said 
schambra quit because he found that the attorney generals firing 
of terry eastland to be unconscionable that it was something that 
terry did not deserve that it inflicts great harm on the 
principles that everyone came here to fight for and that bill does 
not feel obliged to continue in his office if the attorney general 
sees fit to let terry go 
mcdowell commented after meeting with schambra 
at the white house chief presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said i have no reaction to eastlands firing i 
dont know anything about the eastland case he said 
in a letter to meese eastland noted that he had been relieved 
of his duties friday he wrote to meese you have expressed to me 
your desire to have as director of public affairs someone willing 
to aggressively defend you against in effect any and all 
criticism 
eastland said that he had defended meese to the best of my 
ability while exercising good judgment and acting in a manner 
consistent with the obligations of this office 
you have concluded that my efforts have not sufficed 
eastlands letter said 
eastlands letter said that meese had offered him 30 days in 
which to conclude his work and look for a job but i have decided 
that the most appropriate course of action is to end my 
responsibilities today 
i think this is the single greatest mistake ed meese has made 
since becoming attorney general said mcdowell a policital 
conservative 
im still a supporter of the attorney general and i still 
think he would be poorly advised to resign but i think he has 
fallen prety to bad advice from those who confuse blind loyalty 
with good government said mcdowell 
meeses counselor william bradford reynolds and another of his 
top political aides charles cooper were unaware of meeses 
decision to dismiss eastland according to justice department 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the central figure pushing for eastlands dismissal according 
to the department sources was meeses former counselor ken cribb 
who now heads the white house office of domestic affairs 
cribb however denied he played a role in the firing 
that is an utter fabrication and you will find that it 
doesnt check out cribb said the attorney general is entitled 
to make personnel decisions and i support him in that 
eastland a political conservative who has written most of 
meeses speeches has been increasingly concerned in recent months 
by the effect on justice department operations of the ongoing probe 
of meese by independent counsel james mckay said department 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the sources said eastland had planned to wait until after the 
independent counsel issued a report detailing meeses activities 
before deciding whether he would leave the department 
mckay is expected to raise a number of ethical questions about 
meeses activities that will be referred to the office of 
professional responsibility a justice department unit that 
examines possible wrongdoing by department officials 
on march 29 deputy attorney general arnold burns and criminal 
division chief william weld resigned in protest over meeses 
continued tenure at the justice department burns and weld like 
eastland were concerned that meeses legal problems were damaging 
department operations morale and its public image 
eastland said in his letter that the public affairs office has 
an obligation to serve not only the attorney general but also the 
department of justice and the american people 
while we may disagree about the appropriate role of the 
director of this office especially in present circumstances i of 
course recognize your prerogative to have whomever you wish serving 
as director said eastland i am leaving today so that you will 
be at liberty to select a replacement 
mckay launched a criminal investigation of meese on may 11 
1987 he has been investigating meeses ties to the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp and to a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline the 
independent counsel also has been investigating 14000 in regional 
bell telephone stock owned by the attorney general at a time when 
meese was meeting at the justice department with bell executives 
finally mckay has been examining the 40000ayear job of meeses 
wife ursula paid for out of a charitable contribution from a 
washington real estate family leasing space to the justice 
department 
meeses longtime friend e robert wallach now under indictment 
for alleged racketeering in the wedtech scandal was involved in 
each of the matters under investigation by mckays office

iraq reported its 12th attack on an 
iranian tanker in 18 days monday and persian gulf shipping 
executives said they had reports of 10 crewmen killed 
at irans larak island terminal in the strait of hormuz salvage 
teams fought a fire still burning on a spanish supertanker from an 
iraqi raid saturday 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit of london said two more names 
were added to the death toll of the saturday raid in which five 
tankers were hit lloyds said 19 were dead and three missing gulf 
shipping agents put the numbers at two dead and six missing 
a dispatch from the official iraqi news agency said air force 
planes made accurate and effective hits monday on a big naval 
target the standard iraqi term for a tanker owned or chartered 
by iran it said all planes returned safely 
executives said the tanker was hit near irans main oil export 
terminal kharg island in the northern gulf but said they did not 
have the name of the vessel or further details they said there 
were reports of 10 crewmen dead 
iran uses the tankers to ferry oil from kharg to makeshift 
terminals on larak and sirri island in comparatively safer waters 
450 miles down the gulf iraq raids the ships in an attempt to cut 
off the oil revenue iran needs to finance the war which began in 
september 1980 
of the dozen raids iraq has reported since april 29 six have 
been confirmed independently 
us military officials said the wreckage of a marine corps 
helicopter gunship found in the southern gulf would be destroyed 
in place by underwater explosives because it could not be 
salvaged the bodies of the two pilots were recovered sunday 
the navy announced plans for a warship to drop a wreath in the 
central gulf tuesday the first anniversary of an iraqi missile 
attack on the guided missile frigate uss stark in which 37 sailors 
were killed it was hit by two exocet missiles fired by an iraqi 
pilot who mistook it for an iranian ship 
shipping executives said the 325000ton spanish supertanker 
barcelona continued burning and listing heavily two days after 
the iraqi raid on the larak but the vessel had been beached and 
was not expected to sink 
iraqi jets flew a 1500mile roundtrip to hit larak where 
foreign ships load oil brought down the gulf by shuttle tankers it 
was the third and most damaging iraqi attack on the facility in 
seven months 
in addition to the barcelona the other ships damaged were the 
worlds largest vessel the 564739ton liberianflag seawise 
giant the 457841ton britishflag burmah endeavour the argosy a 
152004ton cypriot tanker and the 231712ton iranianowned khark 
iran has accused the united states of complicity in the raid 
claiming american warships jammed radar and radio communications 
for nine minutes us officials deny the allegations 
some diplomatic and shipping industry observers noting the 
attack on larak was among several recent military reversals say 
the iranian military is under growing pressure to restore its 
credibility 
last month iraq recaptured the faw peninsula which iran had 
occupied since 1986 and the us navy destroyed two iranian oil 
platforms and sank or damaged six naval craft april 18 the 
helicopter gunship was lost that day and iran claimed to have shot 
it down 
iran has threatened to avenge the setbacks 
iranian speedboats or frigates customarily attack a neutral 
commercial vessel most often in the southern gulf for each tanker 
hit by the iraqis more than 500 ships have been raided by both 
sides since the war began

arizona voters will decide this november 
whether to drop an unenforced constitutional provision that bars 
women like gov rose mofford from holding the states top 
offices 
the senate voted 27to0 monday for a proposed constitutional 
amendment to remove language that restricts the top offices to men 
the house already has passed the proposed amendment so the senate 
vote automatically places the issue on the november general 
election ballot 
the constitution technically now allows only men to be governor 
secretary of state attorney general school superintendent and 
treasurer 
women have held those jobs for years including mrs mofford 
who had been secretary of state since 1978 and succeeded to the 
governorship on april 4 when gov evan mecham was convicted on two 
impeachment counts by the senate 
senate minority leader alan stephens said monday he wonders what 
will happen if voters reject the amendment however the federal 
constitution supersedes the state document in any case 
assistant minority leader lela alston predicted the proposed 
amendment will be approved nonetheless she added arizona has 
often been accused of being a backward state and the vote may show 
the level of real discrimination against women it will be an 
interesting vote 
a rejection of the amendment would be a terrible terrible 
thing to have ms alston said

aflcio president lane kirkland moved to 
muster support monday for the beleaguered plantclosings provision 
of the omnibus trade bill calling it the human element in the 
1000page package 
fairness alone dictates that workers have the right to know 
about employer decisions that so drastically alter their lives 
kirkland said in attacking president reagans threatened veto of 
the bill 
his veto would rip the heart out of the bill by denying 
workers and their communities the opportunity to avert or ease the 
human catastrophe that occurs when employers move elsewhere 
kirkland said he called the provision the human element in the 
massive measure 
the aflcio has been running radio commericals around the 
country and holding news conferences in selected cities as part of 
a veto override campaign they have focused on a provision of the 
bill that would require companies with 100 or more employees to 
give 60day notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
kirkland urged lawmakers to fight any effort to soften or drop 
the plantclosings provision as a way of making the measure more 
palatable to the white house he said the labor federation would 
oppose any version of the trade bill without the provision 
house speaker jim wright dtexas sent the bill to the white 
house on friday and the president has 10 days not including sundays 
to act upon it or allow it to become law without his signature 
that means the expected veto might not come until early next week 
white house spokesman bj cooper said he could not forecast 
precisely when reagan would veto the bill but added i dont 
think well bump up against the last day 
the centerpiece of the bill would overhaul the system under 
which the united states imposes trade sanctions to retaliate 
against international violations and aid american industries 
threatened by stepped up overseas competition 
reagan has cited the plantclosings provision and alaska oil 
export restrictions in threatening to veto the measure he has been 
saying the laborsupported feature would blunt rather than sharpen 
the nations edge in global markets 
the bill cleared the senate 6336 on april 27 three votes short 
of what democratic leaders believe would be needed to override a 
reagan veto 
in gathering support the administration has been saying that 
once the presidents veto were sustained a modified version with 
more moderate provisions could be whisked through with little 
difficulty 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva has issued a 
warning almost every day since april 27 that there can be no quick 
action on a modified version of the trade bill if reagans veto is 
sustained 
kirkland said the labor federation would withdraw its support if 
the plant closings provision were sacrified to obtain the 
presidents signature he did say in response to a question that he 
would not actively campaign against such a measure

a 74yearold woman described by 
prosecutors as everyones favorite granny was acquitted monday 
of swindling a newspaper out of a bingo jackpot worth nearly 2 
million 
phyllis hanlon wept outside the courtroom in this city in 
northwest england after a jury found her innocent of winning the 
tabloid suns 1millionpound 189 million top prize by fraud 
thank god its all over she said it is the end of a 
nightmare that seems to have gone on forever 
according to testimony the fraud was perpetrated by printer 
arthur sagar whose job was to insert a winning bingo card into 
every batch of 1500 distributed to readers 
sagar gave winning cards to friends in return for a share of the 
winnings the prosecution said the one he gave mrs hanlon won her 
more than 24500 and she won the jackpot in a draw among 80 
winners 
two other women mary young 44 and her motherinlaw margaret 
warde 75 were cleared of charges of obtaining prizes of 18900 
each by conspiracy 
what happens to the jackpot mrs hanlon won in january 1985 
remains to be decided by the courts she said she had given about 
onethird of the money to relatives and others including two 
daughters and bought a home for 189000 
i was very happy to win it but it brought me both happiness 
and sadness she said 
the women were acquitted after the prosecution failed to 
convince the jury they knew the winning cards were stolen they 
were described as impeccably respectable with no criminal 
records 
sagar mrs hanlons soninlaw kenneth fairbrother and two 
other accomplices john and susan marshall pleaded guilty and were 
to be sentenced tuesday 
mrs hanlon said she gave sagar and marshall a total of 100000 
pounds not as a reward for the winning card but because she felt 
sorry for them 
judge reginald lockett told members of the jury they might 
consider mrs hanlon foolish but you are not trying her for 
that may she have been duped deluded and used shamefully by 
others if so she is on my directions not guilty

the government announced monday it was setting up 
a new watchdog body to monitor sex and violence in broadcasting 
and it denied allegations that it was paving the way for censorship 
the broadcasting standards council was promised by the 
conservative party in an election manifesto pledging to clean up 
sex and violence in tv radio and videos 
it will be headed by sir william reesemogg 59yearold former 
editor of the times of london home secretary douglas hurd told 
parliament 
the opposition labor party claimed the council would be used to 
stifle criticism of prime minister margaret thatchers government 
the government has clashed frequently with the british 
broadcasting corp and the independent broadcasting authority 
usually over documentaries dealing with national security or 
northern ireland 
the temperature heated up in recent weeks after both 
corporations broadcast films challenging the official version of 
events in gibraltar march 6 when british antiterrorist agents 
shot to death three irish republican army members who allegedly 
were plotting to plant a bomb 
the films which suggested the victims could have been captured 
alive were broadcast despite expressions of outrage from mrs 
thatcher and pleas for them to be suppressed until after the 
inquest in gibraltar 
the waters of the relationship between the government and the 
broadcasters are a bit choppy at the present time hurd said but 
insisted the councils task was to deal with sex and violence not 
politics 
roy hattersley deputy leader of the opposition labor party 
called it an entirely authoritarian wedge 
the programs which the government objects to are not concerned 
with sex violence and taste but concerned with the governments 
political convenience this body will eventually be expanded to 
inhibit those who dare to criticize this administration he said 
hattersley attacked the choice of reesemogg whom he accused of 
playing an ignoble part in suppressing a program on northern 
ireland when he was a bbc vice chairman 
the councils most controversial power will be to preview 
imported tv material before it is aired many broadcasters have 
objected strongly saying it opens the way for censorship and will 
allow reesemogg to stamp a conservative bias into television 
reesemogg says he asked for the right to preview programs but 
denies he intends to censor politically sensitive material 
government officials argue that the bbc and iba have failed to 
satisfactorily defend standards of decency on the two networks each 
controls 
hurd said the council would be set up immediately and receive 
legal powers when these were approved by parliament 
he said its functions would be to draw up a code of standards in 
consultation with broadcasting cable and video authorities 
monitor and report on the present intake of foreign material 
consider complaints and publicize its findings and conduct 
research into whether televised sex and violence affects behavior

principal charlie jones thumbed through the 
dark blue 1988 yearbook of radcliff middle school on monday 
pointing out 16 of the children who died in one of the worst bus 
accidents in us history 
at page 14 the end of the yearbooks eighthgrade section 
jones paused this page was hard hit he said gently touching 
the smiling pictures of denise vogland amy wheelock kristen 
williams and chad witt 
at least four schools were represented on a church bus that 
crashed saturday as it returned a first assembly of god youth group 
and adult chaperones from the kings island amusement park north of 
cincinnati 
twentyseven on the bus died when a pickup truck being driven in 
the wrong direction on interstate 71 plowed headon into the bus 
causing its fuel tanks to rupture and setting the bus ablaze 
sixteen people including the pickup driver larry mahoney of 
worthville remained hospitalized 
the middle school was hardest hit with three pupils still 
hospitalized besides the 13 eighth graders one seventh grader and 
two sixth graders who were listed as missing and presumed dead 
three other middle school pupils escaped with less serious injuries 
the schools enrollment is 775 and im still not sure what the 
effect will be of losing 16 kids minimum jones said sixteen 
kids out of our school and all of them quality model kids 
amy wheelock for example was miss everything jones said 
she was captain of the cheerleaders and probably the most admired 
girl at school 
the thing that hurts me that i cant get out of my mind is 
that we talk about leaders of tomorrow these kids were leaders 
jones said 
at nearby north hardin high school students were doing as 
well as they can under the circumstance said principal ray story 
three of the schools boys senior richard gohn freshmen 
joshua conyers and anthony marks were among those believed dead 
and eight other students remained hospitalized 
reporters were not allowed inside the high school but lori 
coffey an 18yearold senior said it was silent 
thats the hardest part because you walk down the hall and see 
the hurt but no ones saying anything ms coffey said most 
people are in shock things like this dont happen at our school 
with an enrollment of 1800 the north hardin family is a big 
family story said it doesnt matter that its a large family 
when any one member is missing it affects the whole family 
the schools opened on schedule monday but emphasis was on grief 
management rather than instruction 
one of the bus crash survivors sophomore allen tennison said 
he was back in school because the only way i know how to deal 
with this is to talk about it 
theres times when im home and i look at pictures of my 
friends and it hits me but ive been numb all weekend said 
tennison the 15yearold son of the churchs pastor rev don 
tennison 
the youth described the group on the bus as closeknit everyone 
knew everyone else 
signs of the tragedy were all over radcliff a booming town in 
northcentral kentucky just outside the fort knox army base 
every flag that could be found in the city was at half staff and 
sympathies were spelled out on marquees and display signs at 
businesses and restaurants up and down the main business district 
the message at the sunshine cafe summed them up our hearts go 
out to the families 
counselors and chaplains were standing by at the high school and 
teachers were encouraged to talk about the tragedy with any student 
who felt the need story said 
at the middle school jones said he and his faculty were just 
trying to use good common sense and trying to make it an hour at a 
time 
todays a learning process whether we want to know it or 
not jones said its a tough learning process but it is a 
learning process

many developing countries have lost billions 
of dollars through timber subsidies and giveaways that accelerate 
destruction of tropical forests a research organization said 
monday 
many of these countries have put the timber resource up for 
grabs said the author of the study economist robert repetto 
they collect in royalties and taxes much less than the timber is 
worth the ecological effect has been the extensive wasteful 
rapid destruction of resources 
repetto is a member of the staff of the world resources 
institute which studies environmental issues in the past three 
years the institute has published similar reports critical of 
subsidies in developing countries for energy water and pesticides 
mondays study reviewed several studies of belowcost sales of 
timber by the us forest service from the 191 million acres of 
national forests though the service shows revenues exceeding 
expenses by more than 500 million year repetto estimated that 
once all costs are counted the sales have been losing at least 85 
million a year 
mondays study was meant to complement one by the institute in 
1985 advocating reforestation efforts in developing countries 
about 27 million acres an area slightly larger than virginia 
of forest are being lost in developing countries each year 
according to united nations estimates about twothirds of it is in 
the closed forests typical of the tropics where extensive 
development of tree crowns prevents sunlight from reaching the 
ground 
the traditional assumption has been that deforestation makes 
economic sense even if it makes environmental nonsense said 
james gustave speth president of the institute the work today 
punches a big hole in this traditional assumption 
researchers examined 10 countries china indonesia the 
phillipines malaysia brazil ghana gabon the ivory coast 
liberia and the united states 
in the phillipines for example they found that royalties 
export taxes and other fees captured for the government only 
onesixth of the abovenormal profits what economists call 
economic rent from the timber harvest in the years 19791982 
the fivesixths not captured amounted to about 860 million 
to develop jobs indonesia as well as other countries exempts 
sawn timber and plywood from export taxes and provides other tax 
concessions to mills but the mills use logs so inefficiently that 
in 1983 plywood exports worth 109 at international prices per 
cubic meter of logs processed cost the rupiah equivalent of 133 to 
produce a sacrifice of potential gains possible only because of 
the governments financial incentives and its forgiveness of log 
export taxes the report said 
the ivory coast taxes plywood exports at 1 percent or 2 percent 
and log exports at 25 percent to 45 percent for the iroko species 
according to the report this means more than 50 in taxes are 
foregone for every 25 of extra foreign exchange earnings generated 
when a cubic meter of log is processed into plywood 
brazil provides so many concessions to cattle ranches carved out 
of the amazonian rain forest that over 15 years the typical rancher 
can earn 2 times his initial investment even though the value of 
the total ranch investment counting the governments contribution 
would shrink by half 
the 470 subsidized ranches had converted 64 million acres from 
forest to pasture by 1983 since there are 50000 unsubsidized 
ranches in the amazon the report questioned whether the subsidies 
are worthwhile

the kidnapping and murder of a prominent 
local businessman who suffocated after being buried alive was part 
of a cold calculated plan to collect a 1 million ransom a 
prosecutor said monday 
assistant attorney general michael ficaro told jurors in opening 
arguments that daniel j edwards 31 abducted stephen small on 
sept 2 because he was trying for the big score and that 
edwards never intended stephen small to live 
but defense attorney sheldon reagan told jurors it was a 
tragic but accidental death 
he said evidence would show no signs of injury to small and 
that the wooden box in which he was buried contained water candy 
bars lights and a faulty air supply system 
the state is seeking the death penalty against edwards 
edwards and nancy rish 26 were arrested two days after smalls 
abduction and hours before police found his body in a wooded area 
between kankakee and the indiana border 
miss rish who lived with edwards in bourbonnais also has been 
charged with murder and kidnapping her trial date has not been set 
ficaro said evidence would show that small greatgrandson of 
former illinois gov len small and a member of a prominent media 
family was restoring a frank lloyd wright house last summer while 
edwards was busy building the nightmare that brings us to this 
court today a coffinsize plywood box 
the prosecutor said the jury would hear a tape recording edwards 
made of small telling his family he had been kidnapped and where to 
take the 1 million ransom 
ficaro said edwards fingerprints were found inside the wooden 
box and on plastic pipe at the burial scene but edwards biggest 
mistake was assuming it takes a long time to trace a phone call 
police traced a ransom call to a public telephone in nearby 
aroma park where a witness saw edwards ficaro said 
police said small was lured from his restored home after 
midnight sept 2 the caller identifying himself as a policeman 
asked small to come to another house he owned because it had been 
burglarized 
before dawn nancy small received a call saying her husband 
would be found in a box if the ransom were not paid late in the 
day a call with delivery instructions was unclear the person 
later promised to call back but the family received no other calls

city of sumgait 
talekh salekh ogli ismailov was convicted of premeditated murder 
by a tribunal headed by a member of the supreme court of 
azerbaijan the official tass news agency reported he was the 
first person convicted in the february riots 
the communist party daily pravda reported last week that 
ismailov was accused of intentionally killing someone during the 
unrest from hooligan motives 
tass said legal proceedings were continuing against other 
defendants accused of participating in the rioting that broke out 
feb 28 in sumgait an industrial city on the caspian sea no other 
details of the trials were reported

us industrial production surged 07 percent 
in april as a boom in demand for business equipment helped give the 
country the biggest increase in factory output in six months the 
government said monday 
the federal reserve said the april advance more than three 
times as rapid as the 02 percent march increase pushed overall 
industrial output 64 percent higher than a year ago 
much of the strength in the past year has been credited to 
booming export demand as american producers have benefited from the 
weaker dollar which makes their goods more competitive on overseas 
markets 
for a part of the economy that was in so much trouble just a 
little over a year ago the turnaround in manufacturing has been 
amazing said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the april increase reflected widespread output gains at 
manufacturing plants where production rose 07 percent factories 
producing durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years saw output climb 09 percent while plants making nondurable 
goods boosted output by 04 percent 
there was a 09 percent rise in production of business 
equipment a category including everything from heavy machinery to 
computers strong gains have been registered in this sector all 
year as manufacturers have increased spending to expand their 
production facilities to meet the rising export demand 
after adjusting for inflation business investment shot up at an 
annual rate of 21 percent in the first three months of the year 
the biggest increase in more than four years 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc said this 
pace of investment spending was not sustainable and she predicted 
slower growth in the months ahead 
she said this was part of the reason that dri was forecasting 
that overall economic growth as measured by the gross national 
product would not be as strong in the current quarter as the 23 
percent advance from january through march she predicted the gnp 
would rise at a rate of just 15 percent from april through june 
auto production which had been lagging as manufacturers tried 
to work down a huge backlog of unsold cars jumped sharply for a 
second straight month with passenger cars being assembled at an 
annual rate of 7 million units up from a rate of 66 million in 
march and 61 million in february 
gordon richards an economist with the national association of 
manufacturers said the two increases reflected the automakers 
success automakers in reducing high inventories through aggressive 
sales incentive programs but he said it was possible that supplies 
would again exceed demand later in the year triggering another 
round of production cutbacks 
the overall increase in april was the strongest since a 11 
percent rise last october output slowed a bit early in the year 
reflecting in large part the drop in auto production 
still the slowdown was not anywhere near as severe as some 
economists had forecast immediately following the october stock 
market crash which had raised concerns that sharp production 
cutbacks in the early part of this year would push the country into 
a recession 
output in the mining industry which includes oil and gas 
drilling jumped 13 percent in april following a 07 percent 
march increase the strong gains in both of those months followed a 
string of declines in this sector which has been depressed because 
of past declines in energy prices 
output at the nations utilities fell 08 percent in april 
following an even larger 11 percent drop in march 
the various changes left the industrial production index at 
1356 in april up from 1347 in march

president najib bid farewell to 1300 
soviet soldiers monday calling them my dear friends and said 
his forces are strong enough to fight moslem insurgents when the 
red army is gone 
najib quoted an afghan proverb may your way be safe and your 
dishes tasty in seeing off the soviet convoy which faced the 
danger of guerrilla attacks on the 200mile threeday trip through 
rugged terrain to the soviet border 
gunfire could be heard in the hills around the capital 
apparently from skirmishes between insurgents and government troops 
soviet troops have been in afghanistan since december 1979 
helping fight the guerrillas who launched their insurgency after a 
communist coup in april 1978 the kremlin has agreed to withdraw 
its estimated 115000 soldiers within nine months 
najibs army of 40000 men along with an estimated 100000 
mercenaries police and security agents will be left to fight 
about 200000 insurgents according to western diplomatic sources 
one afghan said the withdrawal was overdue we do not know 
what will happen but until the russians left there could be no 
peace he said 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater described 
the soviet withdrawal as a welcome first step and expressed the 
hope that the entire force will be gone by the end of the year 
about 300 vehicles were in the convoy the first of four 
scheduled to leave the northeastern city of jalalabad near the 
pakistan border guerrilla leaders have vowed to attack jalalabad 
when the soviets are gone 
the convoy covered the 88 miles from jalalabad to kabul on 
sunday it appeared lightly laden burdened only by fuel and water 
tankers 
soviet officials have said they will leave 1 billion worth of 
equipment and bases for the afghan army 
western diplomats in neighboring pakistan said soviet supplies 
continue to pour in they reported frequent night flights during 
the past week by large transport planes 
they also said diplomatic dispatches reported heavy fighting in 
kandahar logar and zabul in the southeast paktia in east ghazni 
just south of kabul and shomali and paghman north and northwest of 
the capital 
at the farewell rally najib said the soviet soldiers had helped 
his country at a time of life and death the afghan leader and 
his military commanders pinned medals on some of the 500 soviet 
soldiers who had stood for two hours during review 
attached to the medals made of gold were blue ribbons with the 
inscription from a grateful afghan people 
military bands played thousands of afghan soldiers and 
civilians waved flags then the convoy lumbered away 
some soldiers said they felt the gorge just north of kabul and 
approaches to the salang tunnel 70 miles north of the city would 
be the most dangerous part of their journey 
information about the withdrawal came from a reuters news agency 
pool report ap reporters were barred from covering the withdrawal 
soviet officials said the exclusion resulted from questions asked 
by the ap during a previous trip to kabul 
in moscow the soviet communist party daily pravda carried a 
frontpage report headlined homeward about the start of 
withdrawal the article accompanied by pictures of the convoy from 
jalalabad praised the soldiers for fulfilling their duty and 
lamented continuing strife in afghanistan 
izvestia the government newspaper called its story the road 
home 
some soldiers left behind said they also were eager to leave 
i am a bit sad but i am going myself in a month i think i 
can hang on a little longer said a soldier identified only as 
alexander from kaunas lithuania 
lt gen vladimir bogdanov said convoys would leave jalalabad on 
alternate days to allow traffic in the opposite direction to use 
the narrow road but all soviets based in the city would be 
withdrawn within two weeks 
mahmood a commander in the hezbiislami guerrilla faction 
told the associated press at his base in pakistan his 10000 men 
would invade jalalabad as soon as the red army was gone 
under the unmediated agreement signed in geneva last month 
half the soviet soldiers must be out of afghanistan by aug 15 
soviet officials have said onequarter will be gone before 
president reagan visits moscow on may 29

the estimated cost of the 95 major weapons 
programs that underlie president reagans military buildup 
declined sharply during the first quarter of fiscal 1988 thanks to 
cancellations spawned by budget cuts the pentagon said monday 
at the close of the quarter on dec 31 the pentagon said the 95 
programs carried a combined pricetag of 75725 billion down 618 
billion or 75 percent from the adjusted sept 30 1987 total of 
81905 billion 
the pentagon attributed the quarterly decline to the 
cancellation or significant cutback of seven dod programs the 
programs were slashed in order to comply with fiscal 1988 spending 
limits adopted last fall in a compromise deficitreduction package 
among the seven were production of copperhead artillery rounds 
development and production of surveillance drone aircraft and 
development of a jamproof high frequency radio system those cuts 
respectively saved 4233 million 13 billion and 44 billion 
also killed were the groundlaunched cruise missile program and 
the satellitekilling asat rocket 
the cruise missile program was killed as a result of the new 
arms agreement with the soviet union barring such 
intermediaterange weapons with a savings of 1543 million the 
asat rocket program was killed because of congress refusal to 
allow additional testing of the device in space producing savings 
of 25 billion 
also eliminated was the midgetman nuclear missile program for a 
projected savings of 414 billion that savings is contingent 
however upon congressional endorsement 
the new cost estimates are contained in the latest version of 
the selected acquisition reports a congressionally required 
review of all major weapons programs 
the reports are designed to provide a broad gauge of how well 
the pentagon is doing in managing its weapons buying they do not 
reflect any change to a program unless there are major schedule 
delays or an increase of at least 5 percent in the cost nor do 
they specify when the last year of buying for each weapon is 
scheduled

here are excerpts from surgeon general c 
everett koops smoking report that proclaims nicotine to be 
addictive 
the opening chapter of the 618report is an overview that lists 
major conclusions followed by eight subsequent chapters and 
two appendices 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
1 cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting 
2 nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction 
3 the pharmacologic and behavioral process that determine 
tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to 
drugs such as heroin and cocaine 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
1 all tobacco products contain substantial amounts of nicotine 
and other alkaloids tobaccos from lowyield and highyield 
cigarettes contain similar amounts of nicotine 
2 nicotine is absorbed readily from tobacco smoke in the lungs 
and from smokeless tobacco in the mouth or nose levels of nicotine 
in the blood are similar in magnitude in people using different 
forms of tobacco with regular use levels of nicotine accumulate 
in the body during the day and persist overnight thus daily 
tobacco users are exposed to the effects of nicotine 24 hours each 
day 
3 nicotine that enters the blood is rapidly distributed to the 
brain as a result effects of nicotine on the central nervous 
system occur rapidly after a puff of cigarette smoke 
4 acute and chronic tolerance develops to many effects of 
nicotine such tolerance is consistent with reports that initial 
use of tobacco products such as in adolescents first beginning to 
smoke is usually accompanied by a number of unpleasant symptoms 
which disappear following chronic tobacco use 
</TEXT>

1 nicotine is a powerful pharmacologic agent that acts in the 
brain and throughout the body actions include electrocortical 
activation skeletal muscle relaxation and cardiovascular and 
endocrine effects the many biochemical and electrocortical effects 
of nicotine may act in concert to reinforce tobacco use 
2 nicotine acts on specific binding sites or receptors 
throughout the nervous system nicotine readily crosses the 
bloodbrain barrier and accumulates in the brain shortly after it 
enters the body once in the brain it interacts with specific 
receptors and alters brain energy metabolism in a pattern 
consistent with the distribution of specific binding sites for the

3 nicotine and smoking exert effects on nearly all components 
of the endocrine and neuroendocrine systems including 
catecholamines serotonin corticosteroids pituitary hormones 
some of these endocrine effects are mediated by actions of nicotine 
on brain neurotransmitter systems eg hypothalamicpituitary 
axis in addition nicotine has direct peripherally mediated 
effects eg on the adrenal medulla and the adrenal cortex

tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to 
drugs such as heroin and cocaine

social pressure are important influences of initiation patterns of 
use quitting and relapse to use of opioids alcohol nicotine and 
other addicting drugs

other drugs are able to give up their drug use outside the context 
of treatment programs other persons however require the 
assistance of formal cessation programs to achieve lasting drug 
abstinence

1 after smoking cigarettes or receiving nicotine smokers 
perform better on some cognitive tasks including sustained 
attention and selective attention than they do when deprived of 
cigarettes or nicotine however smoking and nicotine do not 
improve general learning 
2 stress increases cigarette consumption among smokers 
further stress has been identified as a risk factor for initiation 
of smoking in adolescence 
3 in general cigarette smokers weigh less approximately 7 
pounds less on average than nonsmokers many smokers who quit 
smoking gain weight 
4 food intake and probably metabolic factors are involved in 
the inverse relationship between smoking and body weight there is 
evidence that nicotine plays an important role in the relationship 
between smoking and body weight

1 tobacco dependence can be treated successfully 
2 effective interventions include behavioral approaches alone 
and behavioral approaches with adjunctive pharmacologic treatment 
3 behavioral interventions are most effective when they include 
multiple components procedures such as aversive smoking skills 
training group support and selfreward inclusion of too many 
treatment procedures can lead to less successful outcome 
4 nicotine replacement can reduce tobacco withdrawal symptoms 
and may enhance the efficacy of behavorial treatment

gov john sununu announced monday he will 
not seek an unprecedented fourth twoyear term as new hampshires 
chief executive 
the announcement at a statehouse news conference ended months of 
speculation about the 48yearold republicans political future and 
seems likely to set off a scramble in the gop ranks 
sununu said he plans to return to private business to help pay 
hefty tuition bills for several of his eight children but he 
wouldnt rule out taking a post in vice president george bushs 
presidential campaign sununu played a key role in bushs critical 
victory in new hampshires leadoff presidential primary three 
months ago 
portsmouth lawyer paul mceachern who lost to sununu by eight 
percentage points in 1986 appears likely to run unopposed for the 
democratic nomination 
former manchester mayor robert shaw has announced intentions to 
run for the gop nomination and among others said to be interested 
is republican rep judd gregg a halfdozen others are said to be 
waiting to step in should gregg vacate the 2nd congressional 
district seat 
some gop leaders fear a primary bloodbath if gregg leaves a seat 
that has been republican for more than 70 years potentially 
opening the door to a democratic victory 
sununus decision also has implications for the stalled seabrook 
nuclear power plant sununu has been among its staunchest 
supporters while mceachern vows never to let it open 
a fiscally conservative governor sununu takes credit for 
helping erase a 44 million deficit and replacing it with a surplus 
under his administration his critics accuse him of leaving too 
much to communities to decide including planning for the states 
booming growth but sununu has long held that the state should 
offer technical assistance to cities and towns while letting them 
chart their own courses 
sununu was a business consultant and tufts university 
engineering professor before his election as governor in 1982 he 
was born in havana cuba where his father was an importexport 
executive 
he served in new hampshires house in 1972 then lost state 
senate bids in 1974 and 1976 in 1978 he ran unsuccessfully for 
executive council and in 1980 finished second in a field of 11 in 
a us senate primary 
after winning the nomination in 1982 he beat democratic gov 
hugh gallen sununu won reelection in 1984 by easily beating 
former house minority leader chris spirou and in 1986 beat 
mceachern

a top justice department official said monday 
he remains hopeful that a senior attorney involved in a maternity 
leave dispute with the department will return to work despite her 
vow not to come back 
but assistant attorney general john bolton who heads the 
departments criminal division said a schedule cannot be arranged 
until attorney joan bernott provides information to enable the 
department to determine what duties she can perform 
i said to her we will do nothing to jeopardize her health 
said bolton who has offered ms bernott the possibility of working 
parttime 
bolton had ordered ms bernott to return to work may 31 or 
submit additional medical information from her doctor giving a 
reason why her leave should be extended to midaugust 
on may 4 bolton rejected her request which is supported by a 
note from her doctor to extend her leave without pay to aug 15 
ms bernott who went on maternity leave jan 25 is seeking seven 
months instead of the usual three months to four months leave 
last week bolton extended her leave to may 31 pending receipt 
of more information from her doctor 
but ms bernott said monday shell probably get fired 
im not going to go back against my doctors advice and my own 
best judgment she said on cbstvs this morning program i 
think ill be awol which will subject me to disciplinary 
proceedings and discharge 
bolton refused to speculate on what steps may be taken if ms 
bernott fails to return to work but he said he remains hopeful she 
will comply with the request for additional medical information 
ms bernott 42 obtained a letter from her physician dr 
sandra m chase on march 28 saying she needed an additional four 
months of recuperation from a difficult pregnancy 
return to work now in my opinion represents health risk to 
this patient the doctor said in a followup april 26 letter 
submitted as a result of boltons request for more information 
ms bernott charged in the interview that bolton has made 
accusations and threats beyond his request for additional 
information from her doctors 
he is holding three letters from two of my physicians and he 
hasnt just denied my request for leave he has issued reprisals 
against me accused me of fraud asked me to sign waivers of 
confidentiality of all my medical records ms bernott said he 
has demanded that my physicians answer 27 questions probing 
details of their opinion and my medical condition 
he has canceled a reassignment that had been arranged for me 
about a year ago and has been in the works since then she said 
bolton said the queries are consistent with information the 
department normally requests in considering all any extended leave 
request from an employee including maternity leave 
he also said he has left the door open on the subject of her 
reassignment in the divison 
ms bernott who has three children was the departments lead 
attorney in successfully defending the government against 
litigation surrounding the use of the defoliant agent orange during 
the vietnam war 
bolton said the civil division faces an enormous workload and 
that it was vital that its 25 senior attorney positions one of 
which is held by ms bernott be staffed fully

pat robertson formally suspended his 
moribund presidential campaign monday applauding runaway victor 
george bush but saying he was not ready to hand over his relative 
handful of republican convention delegates 
the former television evangelist said he would return to the 
christian broadcasting network which has suffered in his absence 
and would establish a new christian political action committee 
asked about his own political future he said that remains a 
moot question until the 1988 election i hope mr bush is elected 
and then reelected again in 1992 
the high point of the robertson campaign came early in the feb 
8 caucuses in iowa where he finished ahead of bush in second place 
behind kansas sen bob dole 
when it came to open primaries robertsons relatively small but 
committed invisible army was less effective he finished last 
in new hampshire on feb 16 third in south carolina march 5 and 
then was trounced in the march 8 super tuesday primaries in which 
he had hoped to do well in my backyard 
voters in his home state of virginia placed him a distant third 
behind bush and dole on super tuesday 
following the march 15 illinois primary in which he got less 
than 10 percent of the vote he scaled back his campaign to 
concentrate only on caucus states he talked less about being 
president and more about being the conservative voice that would 
speak for a conservative platform but he kept his formal candidacy 
alive long after any chance of winning was gone 
i will work to ensure that the 1988 platform follows closely 
the conservative principles of our 1984 platform he said monday 
that platform called for prayer in school opposed abortion and 
supported family values 
i call upon my friends and supporters to continue their 
splendid efforts because our struggle is not finished it is just 
beginning robertson told reporters outside his home on the cbn 
university campus he was accompanied by his wife dede and son tim 
i suspend my candidacy but i do not now nor will i ever 
suspend my advocacy of conservative and moral principles said 
robertson who campaigned in 34 states and won 46 delegates after 
spending 22 million bush has more than 1300 delegates 
i will take my delegates to new orleans robertson said 
his new political action committee americans for the republic 
will support and train conservative christian candidates and will 
be staffed by robertson campaign workers 
another task robertson faces is shoring up the ailing cbn which 
has faced a big decrease in revenues since robertson left the air 
last fall to begin his campaign the network laid off 645 employees 
last year 
after today i hope we never again have to lay off people 
robertson said of a new round of layoffs on monday he declined to 
say how many employees were let go 
robertson will replace his son as cbns chief executive officer 
during the presidential race robertson frequently criticized 
bush even suggesting that the vice presidents campaign had 
engineered the timing of the jimmy swaggart scandal to detract from 
robertson but he said monday george bush has won the 
nomination i applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorse his 
candidacy 
robertsons campaign was marked by striking charges including 
that there are russian nuclear missiles in cuba an allegation 
the reagan administration as well as fidel castro denied 
that the state department ignored intelligence gathered by cbn 
people in beirut about the location of hostages an allegation that 
brought public skepticism from president reagan 
robertsons campaign specialized in mobilizing political 
neophytes from charismatic and fundamentalist churches to take over 
local party operations 
there is an enterprise the lord set me on a year or so ago 
running for president robertson told a denver congregation 
easter sunday out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a 
foundation for a great victory for this nation it may not be in 
1988 but i am not going to quit that is his plan for me and 
for this nation

the once widely used copper7 
intrauterine contraceptive device was back on trial monday and 
plaintiffs attorneys said they were armed with internal documents 
never before used against the gd searle amp co product 
the minneapolis law firm robins zelle larson amp kaplan which 
represented plaintiffs in earlier litigation against dalkon shield 
maker ah robins co settling 198 cases for a total of 38 
million also is representing the plaintiffs in the case against 
searle 
robins zelle which is representing more than 30 other women in 
separate copper7 lawsuits has said evidence introduced in the 
firms first trial against searle is expected to set a foundation 
for lawsuits to come 
us district judge robert g renner questioned potential jurors 
monday to hear the suit brought by esther r kociemba 29 of the 
melrose area northwest of here and her husband william opening 
arguments were planned tuesday 
while 17 other cases involving the copper7 nationwide have gone 
to trial attorney roger p brosnahan has said his law firm will 
introduce internal company documents not used in those trials 
those documents he said will show that searle marketed the iuds 
without regard for womens health and safety 
searle which won 14 of the earlier cases has denied that its 
iud caused any injury to the women one of the cases lost by searle 
is on appeal 
when they filed the suit in october 1984 the kociembas asked 
for 500000 in compensatory damages and 500000 in punitive 
damages plus court costs for injuries mrs kociemba allegedly 
suffered as a result of using a copper7 iud for just under 1 
years in 1977 and 1978 the couple later amended their lawsuit to 
ask for an unspecified amount 
according to the suit mrs kociemba has experienced 
infertility illnesses great pain suffering and mental 
anguish that have continued since she had the iud removed in 
november 1978 
more than a dozen attorneys for robins zelle have been going 
through documents involved in the searle iud cases for more than 
three years in preparation for the trial brosnahan said 
we have gone through some 500000 or more documents he said 
in addition the law firm began taking the depositions of searle 
employees former employees outside testing groups and expert 
witnesses named on searles behalf about 2 years ago he said 
there have been 60 or 70 of those depositions which consume 
about 15000 pages of transcript brosnahan said very few of 
the documents and none of the deposition testimony was ever used in 
the previous trials 
so in our judgment it will be the first real trial involving 
the copper7 he said 
spokeswoman kay bruno at searle headquarters in skokie ill 
disputed that saying searle doesnt view the suit as much 
different from earlier suits brought against the company many of 
the documents have been used in previous court cases she said 
searle withdrew the copper7 and its other iud the tatumt 
from the us market and stopped manufacturing the two items in 
january 1986 citing the cost of litigation and the unavailability 
of liability insurance however the iuds still are available in 
foreign countries 
bruno said more than 800 lawsuits involving the iud have been 
filed against searle of those many have been settled out of 
court she said about 500 suits still are pending against the 
company 
the copper7 a small device made of plastic and copper was 
approved by the us food and drug administration in 1974 and 
searle sold between 300000 and 400000 iuds in the united states 
annually before withdrawing the product from the us market 
in the kociemba copper7 trial brosnahan said robins zelle 
attorneys believe they can establish through the testimony of 
searle employees and former employees and through the companys 
internal documents that searle was not honest with physicians or 
the public about potential problems related to the copper7 
we think the evidence will clearly show that the company was 
not telling the doctors or the women what they knew and in fact 
were telling them things that were contrary to what they knew or 
had every good reason to know he said

the world bank announced new programs monday 
to aid women in eight countries where male interests traditionally 
dominate 
the countries are kenya nigeria zimbabwe india bangladesh 
pakistan morocco and mexico 
you will see pathfinding investments on behalf of women in a 
wide range of activities in education generally in both formal 
and informal training for employment in agricultural extension and 
financing in health and family planning services and in 
environmental protection said barber b conable president of 
the world bank 
the bank is the chief source of aid to nearly 120 third world 
countries it makes loans of 17 billion a year and is planning an 
increase to well beyond the 20 billion level in the 1990s the 
united states is the largest shareholder joined in contributions 
by more than 30 others 
conable said there will be added support for women in other 
countries as well as the eight singled out 
he was speaking to the overseas education fund of the league of 
women voters it gave him and his wife charlotte an award in 
recognition of help to women in poor countries 
what you will see and what i hope you will take part in is a 
determined drive not just to overcome discrimination and the 
poverty it reinforces but to put women at the forefront of the 
fight against poverty in the developing world he said 
he saw a change in policies toward women in the third world 
in access to education to credit to basic health services 
we are in the midst of a revolution but one that still leaves 
women too far behind conable said 
so the revolution we must continue is the one that closes the 
gap between men and women in the third world by creating 
opportunities for both sexes 
help for women in the third world has been the subject of a 
clash between the reagan administration and some members of 
congress a bill supported by democratic legislators would order 
the us agency for international development to make sure its 
training programs abroad enroll as many women as men 
aid administrator alan m woods opposes the bill on the ground 
that it would hamper his agencys programs in countries that 
traditionally deny many rights to women

the protesters about 65 members of a new york group called the 
aids coalition to unleash power act up disrupted the meeting for 
nearly an hour with humming heckling and symbolic gestures such as 
turning their backs on the commission and holding up their watches 
to signify that time is running out for aids victims 
the hearing the first of three was part of a controversial 
civil rights commission study of civil rights aspects of public 
health policies and initiatives to control aids including a 
discussion of how aids is transmitted 
the study has drawn fire from lawmakers and others since it was 
proposed last year in a memo that among other things cites state 
antisodomy laws and a court case in the same footnote as lengthy 
biblical condemnations of homosexuality 
do you still want us put to death clarence one protester 
demanded of commission chairman clarence pendleton referring to a 
passage from leviticus recommending just that 
its a waste of time another protester shouted 
spend the money on drug research added a third 
they all filed out wearing their clown masks chanting shame 
shame shame 
this is a total farce said duncan osborne a protester 
these people ought to be taking testimony about discrimination 
against people with aids he said only three victims were 
scheduled to testify in three full days of hearings 
the protest came after a morning session dominated by friction 
among commission members as well as among witnesses on the first 
panel 
those witnesses included a blood bank official a gay rights 
activist a religious hospice operator who said he had moved away 
from the narcissism and contempt of my earlier life as a 
homosexual and a university of minnesota radiologist who claimed 
public health efforts have been thwarted by gay pressure groups 
twentyfive years ago it was southern bullies in jeans that we 
had to fight said dr david pence the radiologist a veteran of 
the civil rights movement now its northern smoothies in ties 
who use middle class conventions to prevent us from using public 
health measures to protect the urban poor 
he has just likened us to the ku klux klan exploded 
jeffrey levi executive director of the national gay and lesbian 
task force he said he could not continue to sit at the same table 
as pence unless the doctor apologized or retracted his statement 
i will not withdraw my basic thesis pence replied the 
gay pressure groups have stopped us from using an effective public 
health policy and theyve done it in the name of civil rights 
the road to selma did not lead to the right to sodomy the 
freedom train has been hijacked 
dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy 
and infectious diseases said public health officials had not been 
influenced by any lobbying groups in determining aids policy or 
interpreting aids research 
it is totally preposterous to even imagine that any scientist 
i know would take a stand on how the virus is transmitted based 
on pressure fauci said the evidence is overwhelming 
levi said the gay community had never stood in the way of 
measures to stop aids it is our own lives that we are saving 
he said 
he said gay people support anonymous voluntary testing but they 
fear that if anyone knows they are aids victims or carriers they 
will face discrimination in jobs housing insurance and other 
areas and maybe even prosecution for violating sodomy laws 
he urged the commission to recommend extending protection of the 
handicapped to the private sector and to support laws barring 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation 
discussion at the hearing ranged far and wide with pence 
claiming that sexual addicts people who engage in compulsive 
coital behavior outside of marriage need as much rehabilitation 
as drug addicts 
bills barring discrimination against aids victims are pending in 
both house and senate committees the presidential commission on 
aids charged with developing a national aids policy was 
conducting three days of hearings this week on the same days and 
the same subject as the civil rights commission hearings

presidential candidate jesse jackson will rely 
on a team of democratic party insiders this summer to run his 
convention operation headed by former party official and civil 
rights attorney ron brown 
brown as jacksons manager at the july convention in atlanta 
will oversee the campaigns efforts on the standing committees the 
party platform and rules an area where campaign officials have 
hinted jackson might orchestrate a challenge 
jackson has assembled an experienced convention crew that also 
includes ann lewis a former democratic national committee 
political director who has been advising the jackson campaign 
eleanor holmes norton former chairwoman of the equal employment 
opportunity commission attorney harold ickes an expert on rules 
and john oleary a logistics whiz and campaign veteran who was the 
hall manager at the 1984 democratic convention 
jackson campaign coordinator yolanda carroway also a former dnc 
official will work directly under brown brown was deputy chairman 
of the dnc from 1981 to 1985 and worked for sen edward kennedys 
presidential campaign in 1980 
carroway said former dnc chairman john white also will advise 
jackson at the convention 
dnc spokesman mike mccurry said party officials are viewing the 
appointment of brown as a good sign because of his strong links to 
the party and knowledge of the establishment ropes 
theyre playing real good ball right now theyre keeping 
lines open with the party mccurry said 
it helps to have people that have been on the inside said 
carroway acknowledging that the convention team was selected with 
party connections in mind 
asked if jackson picked a convention team to send a message that 
he will be conciliatory rather than confrontational at the 
convention carroway said im sure that was considered 
some in the party have been concerned that jackson might force a 
rift at the convention especially in light of his recent 
insistence on fairness in the allocation of the socalled 
super delegates those individuals who are delegates by virtue 
of their elected or party offices are free to vote for the 
candidate of their choice but jackson says they should line up 
proportionately to the popular vote 
carroway said monday that the campaign has not yet decided 
whether to mount a challenge on seating of delegates but that 
its being talked about 
lewis will oversee jacksons involvement with the standing 
committees norton will be the campaigns representative on the 
platform committee and ickes will focus on rules oleary will 
handle the physical and logistical arrangements

government forces on monday bombarded 
lookout towers in the golden temple with incendiary bombs and fired 
machine guns to try to dislodge dozens of radical sikhs 
police said more than 50 militants remained in the compound 
which has been surrounded by more than 2800 police and troopers 
for a week the 400yearold temple is the sikh religions holiest 
shrine and center of a violent campaign for a separate sikh nation 
in punjab state 
at least 35 people most of them sikh militants have been 
killed 
elsewhere in punjab 42 people were killed in attacks by sikh 
extremists in different attacks in a 24hour period united news of 
india reported 
a paramilitary officer involved in the golden temple siege said 
we will have to starve them out or think of other alternatives i 
think we will be here for quite some time 
he spoke with reporters while seven of the 146 sikhs who 
surrendered sunday appealed to their comrades to give up 
please come out with your hands up skatter singh said 
through a loudspeaker the officers are good to us none of us 
has been troubled 
sporadic gunfire was the only response from militants inside the 
20foothigh walls 
skatter singh belongs to the khalistan commando force one of 
several sikh separatist groups with offices in the golden temple 
compound khalistan is what the sikhs would call their nation 
the seven made their appeals during two pauses in army firing at 
two 18th century brick towers in the compound 
at dusk a new saffroncolored khalistan flag fluttered from the 
window of one sootcovered clock tower at the northern entrance to 
the temple complex 
on monday evening commandoes of the black cat antiterrorist 
squad were seen moving into a dining hall in front of the towers 
sources said an underground passage links the dining hall and 
towers they said about five militants were thought to be in the 
basement of the towers 
united news of india gave this report of the killings by sikh 
extremists in punjab sunday night and monday 
gunmen opened fire on crowds in samana town killing 18 people 
and wounding 18 in samrai village five people were shot to death

town killing a 2monthold child and another person the owner of 
the clinic dr kewal krishan was wounded 
at least 17 other people were killed in scattered attacks in the 
northern state 
the deaths raised the number of people killed in attacks blamed 
on sikh radicals to at least 1002 this year most of the victims 
were hindus but some were sikh moderates 
sarabjeet singh deputy police commissioner in amritsar said at 
least 40 sikh radicals were in the golden temples inner sanctum 
which is surrounded by a vast pool and approachable only by a 
marble walkway 
we do not want to hurt the sentiments of the sikh community by 
doing anything that might harm the harimandir sahib inner 
sanctum said chaman lal inspector general of police in punjab 
state but at the same time we are trying to convey to them the 
militants that we mean business 
devout sikhs would view any attempt to storm the inner sanctum 
as desecration 
prime minister indira gandhi sent the army into the golden 
temple in 1984 to drive out sikh extremists and was assassinated by 
sikh bodyguards five months later more than 1200 people were 
killed in the assault 
militants have fought a terrorist war since 1982 for a sikh 
nation 
sikhs make up only 2 percent of indias 800 million people and 
claim discrimination by hindus who account for 82 percent sikhs 
are a majority in punjab state 
kps gill police chief of punjab told a news conference 
monday that 146 people surrendered sunday not 151 as another 
official reported earlier

surgeon general c everett koops declaration 
monday that nicotine is addictive like heroin and cocaine prompted 
quick introduction of legislation to require new warnings on 
cigarette packages 
it also set off a groundswell of support from health and 
antismoking groups and a firestorm of protest from the tobacco 
industry 
koop at the start of a 618page report that was no surprise to 
researchers said careful examination of the data makes it clear 
that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting an 
extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug in 
tobacco that causes addiction 
moreover the processes that determine tobacco addiction are 
similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin 
and cocaine koop wrote 
those three sentences in the reports preface not only summed up 
the documents essential conclusion they tacticly acknowledged 
that the report was based more on a review of existing research 
rather than on new scientific findings 
it was on that ground that the report did not represent new 
clinical research that the opponents based their main attack 
what i think we have to do and understand is to put it in its 
political context said reggie lester a spokesman for the 
tobacco growers information committee in north carolina the state 
that produces 67 percent of the us tobacco crop 
this is not a scientific report he said all this is a 
compilation of recent literature but they will be able to use 
it in a political context like they did with the report about 
environmental tobacco smoke 
lester referred to koops december 1986 report that concluded 
nonsmokers health was harmed by smoke from other peoples 
cigarettes and gave impetus to widespread and still growing efforts 
to restrict cigarette smoking in the workplace and public areas 
two weeks ago federal legislation went into effect banning 
smoking on commercial airline flights of two hours or less duration 
this report and the surgeon generals findings should compel 
federal and state authorities to treat tobacco as the addictivve 
drug that it is said dr alan r nelson chairman of the board 
of trustees of the american medical association 
john banzhaf a george washington university law professor who 
also heads the antismoking activist group called action on smoking 
and health predicted koops report would strengthen a key legal 
argument for plaintiffs in law suits in which cigarette 
manufacturers argue that smokers should not be permitted to recover 
damages because they smoked of their own free will rather than 
because of an addiction 
the most direct call to action in mondays report was for new 
cigarette warning labels saying nicotine is addictive 
sen bill bradley dnj introducted a bill that would add a 
new label to the four already alternating on cigarette packs it 
would read warning smoking is addictive once you start you 
may not be able to stop 
koop said he would like to see such a warning say nicotine is 
just as addictive as heroin or cocaine 
the surgeon general said he was under no illusion that tobacco 
will ever be outlawed in the united states but said we need to 
do all we can to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids 
banning vending machine sales banning free samples requiring a 
license to sell tobacco and so forth fortythree of our states 
do have laws that should protect children but they are very poorly 
enforced if at all i think we need a license to sell tobacco just 
the way we require one to sell alcohol 
asked if he was concerned that equating nicotine with addicting 
illicit drugs might trivialize the muchpublicized war on 
drugs koop cited federal statistics that tobacco use results in an 
estimated 320000 premature deaths per year in the united states 
compared with 125000 for alcohol 4000 from alcohol in 
combination with other drugs 4000 from opioid or heroinlike 
drugs and 2000 from cocaine 
i dont see theres any way you could consider the nicotine 
problems that we have as trivializing other problems he said 
koop also was asked about whether his report might create more 
antagonism between smokers and nonsmokers 
i think it would mean in general more sympathy for the person 
who cant quit he said you might get annoyed at people who 
smoke in your presense and make your eyes burn and your sinuses 
clog up and so forth but your anger has to be abated by the fact 
that these people are addicted to a drug and i think this will make 
people more tolerant of the problems a smoker faces when he is 
trying to quit 
the tobacco institute said smoking is truly a personal choice 
which can be stopped if and when a person decides to do so the 
surgeon generals own public health service figures indicate that 
about 40 million americans are former smokers and that 95 percent 
of them quit smoking without help these figures and common sense 
contradict any claim that smoking is an addiction

philippine defense secretary fidel v ramos 
asked the reagan administration monday to accelerate military aid 
to his country but avoided any discussion about the fate of us 
bases there pentagon officials said monday 
ramos met for several hours with defense secretary frank c 
carlucci and adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff 
according to one official who attended the meetings ramos 
offered an indepth report on some of the gains made by the 
philippine military and some of the problems they still face in 
fighting communist insurgents 
it was kind of a report card with a request to accelerate the 
military aid that has already been promised added the source 
who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified he 
didnt raise the issue of the us bases he said that was a 
matter for the appointed negotiators and not him 
us and philippine teams are now meeting in manila to review 
agreements allowing us military bases in the country philippine 
officials have talked about huge increases in what the united 
states pays for use of the bases now about 180 million a year 
the pentagon official said ramos had specifically asked that 
efforts be quickened to supply his army with 20 armed observation 
helicopters already promised by the administration 
he also asked to accelerate funds for military education 
the source said 
ramos discussed his budget problems his equipment problems 
and the restructuring of the military in the wake of various coup 
attempts against philippines president corazon aquino a second 
official said 
he expressed his thanks for the military assistance given over 
the past year and asked for continued support the official said 
ramos a west point graduate who became authoritarian ruler 
ferdinand marcos no 2 military commander and then helped lead the 
february 1986 revolution that overthrew him is making a 10day 
visit to the united states that includes meetings with carlucci 
secretary of state george p shultz other officials and members of 
congress 
his message according to philippine government spokesman ben 
david is that his country cannot overcome the communist threat 
with military force alone but still needs more military aid 
we are now on the upgrade we have gotten out of the very deep 
hole where we found ourselves in february 1986 ramos told a 
mostly filipinoamerican gathering saturday night in the washington 
area 
but he said the country still faces serious problems including 
poverty social injustice the need for land reform and better 
education 
ramos said new reforms and the failure of communistsupported 
candidates in elections have helped limit growth of the insurgency 
that arose during marcos 20year rule 
but he said the communist rebels are still a significant force 
with up to 23000 fighters about twothirds of whom are armed he 
said that number has changed little since president corazon aquino 
came to power

the senate trying to wrap up work on a 
pentagon budget bill refused monday to eliminate a proposal 
permitting the death penalty for drug dealers who are convicted of 
killing people 
the senate voted 6827 not to table and thus kill the death 
penalty proposal offered by sen alfonse damato rny 
the american people are entitled to this protection said 
damato i think we have to find a clearer message for those who 
deal in drugs the deathdealing drug lords fear no one 
sen carl levin dmich and other opponents noted that 
damatos amendment had nothing specifically to do with the 
pentagon budget and should be considered in another forum senate 
rules do not require that amendments be germane to pending 
legislation 
but levin also opposed the amendment because he said studies 
have shown that people sometimes are wrongly convicted of crimes 
the main reason im opposed to capital punishment is that you 
cannot correct your mistakes levin said time and time again 
weve found that weve convicted the wrong man 
levins unsuccessful move to kill damatos amendment left the 
damato plan in limbo it has not been adopted and thus is still 
one of the unresolved issues as the senate tries to finish work on 
the pentagon bill 
opponents of damatos plan have threatened to filibuster his 
amendment in an effort to prevent a vote on it 
the senate is tentatively scheduled to take a final vote tuesday 
morning on the bill which authorizes 2995 billion in pentagon 
spending for the fiscal year starting oct 1 
senate passage of the pentagon budget would send it to a 
housesenate conference committee where it would have to be 
reconciled with the separate defense budget approved last week by 
that chamber 
the house bill does not contain any provisions similar to 
damatos death penalty plan and addition of the proposal could 
hold up final action on the pentagon budget for months said sen 
sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee 
we wont be able to get a defense bill with this amendment on 
it said nunn adding that he supported the amendment 
he explained that addition of the damato amendment would mean

libras in surveys done from 198587 by the national opinion 
research center 
another 32 percent of libras considered themselves republicans 
but only 28 percent of aquarians and just 25 percent of 
sagittarians backed the gop

percent werent sure while 23 percent believed in the influence of

the federal government is planning regulations 
requiring operators of city transit buses and subways to be subject 
to a broad range of drug tests including random tests a senior 
department official said monday 
alfred dellibovi head of the urban mass transportation 
administration said local transit officials who fail to develop a 
testing program for drugs would face the loss of federal transit 
subsidies 
the federal regulations that are being prepared call on transit 
officials to test for illegal use of drugs during preemployment 
after an accident for reasonable cause and under a random 
selection process according to dellibovi 
operators of buses and subway trains as well as others in 
sensitive jobs such as train dispatchers would be subject to 
the testing he said 
the federal agency which dellibovi heads provides federal 
financial assistance to transit systems although a testing program 
would have to be imposed and administered by the local transit 
authorities 
dellibovi outlined his agencys plans in a speech before the 
american public transit associations annual education conference 
he noted a recent finding by investigators in the april 6 crash 
of a commuter train in new york city in which traces of illegal 
drugs were found in five employees involved in the accident 
including the trains engineer and the dispatcher 
similar horror stories may have occurred in your own area 
dellibovi told the transit officials in st louis according to a 
copy of his speech released through his office in washington 
dellibovi criticized the transit industry for not tackling the 
drug testing issue instead he said the industry has been 
debating the merits of permitting passengers to smoke in the back 
of the trains 
the recent new york accident is only the current victim of an 
industrywide failure to tackle the tough issue of random drug 
testing he said all too often this reluctance to take on 
such a distasteful issue produces an ineffective antidrug 
program instead of a steadfast policy 
dellibovi gave no timetable on when the federal drug testing 
requirements would be announced formally or go into effect but he 
said they will require that local transit authorities 
aggressively enforce them or face the loss of federal financial 
assistance

israels foreign minister shimon peres 
explored avenues for arabisraeli peacemaking during talks monday 
with secretary of state george p shultz other government 
officials and members of congress 
peres went to shultzs home for breakfast and met him again at a 
luncheon hosted by israeli ambassador moshe arad also present at 
the luncheon were defense secretary frank carlucci white house 
chief of staff howard baker and leaders of congress 
the state department said it did not have any information about 
the morning meeting except that the two leaders discussed shultzs 
moribund plan for arabisraeli peace talks israeli officials said 
neither shultz nor peres wanted to divulge details of their talks 
which were to continue tuesday 
at a luncheon toast shultz praised peres creativity in 
seeking to advance peace talks shultz who has scheduled his 
fourth shuttle of the year to the mideast next month said jordan 
and israel had neither rejected nor accepted his peace plan 
quoting a favorite peres analogy shultz said the violent 
situation in the region is like a pregnant woman it cannot 
continue to be pregnant for long 
peres in his remarks called on shultz to press for acceptance 
of the us initiative saying there were many obstacles in its way 
but the alternative is more serious i prefer an imperfect 
peace to a perfect war 
peres supports the shultz plan but his rival in israels 
coalition government prime minister yitzhak shamir opposes the 
blueprint jordans king hussein has also expressed reservations 
syria has rejected the plan and egypt is the only country to 
support it openly 
peres was also meeting with members of congress to discuss the 
peace process the fivemonth palestinian rebellion in the 
israelioccupied territories and planned us arms sales to saudi 
arabia 
dozens of members from both the senate and house have expressed 
reservations about the administrations plan to sell the saudis a 
325 million support and maintenance package for electronic 
surveillance awacs planes and 200 million worth of bradley 
fighting vehicles 
the congressmen are upset with the saudis for their clandestine 
purchase of chinesemade intermediate range missiles which could 
hit israel 
peres meetings with shultz and with president reagan on 
tuesday which are not expected to produce movement on the stalled 
peace plan are viewed by israelis as a bid by peres for us 
support in advance of israels fall election campaign 
peres head of the labor party will face off against shamir 
leader of the rightwing likud bloc 
shamir opposes the shultz plan because it envisions oversight by 
the five permanent members of the united nations security council 
the united states china the soviet union england and france 
shamir fears the five powers would coerce israel to give up arab 
lands it captured in the 1967 mideast war 
in another development monday assistant secretary of state for 
human rights richard schifter told a peres aide the united states 
was concerned that israels tactics to subdue the fivemonth 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip were 
getting harsher said an israeli official 
schifter told israeli foreign ministry director yossi beilin 
that he was concerned the exceptions were becoming the norm 
said the official who asked not to be named 
israel has repeatedly said cases of abuse against palestinians 
were unauthorized exceptions and the soldiers committing them would 
be punished some 180 palestinians have been killed in the rioting 
and thousands have been wounded by tear gas clubs and bullets 
schifter himself declined to comment on the meeting us public 
criticism of israels tactics has been muted in keeping with a 
belief that addressing the problem in private diplomatic contacts 
is more effective

former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane was identified monday as an unindicted irancontra 
coconspirator in oliver l norths motion to be tried separately 
from his three codefendants 
the legal status of mcfarlane who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor 
charges of withholding information from congress about secret 
reagan administration aid to nicaraguan contra rebels was 
mentioned in a footnote to norths request for a separate trial 
the names of the unindicted coconspirators in the case have 
been sealed by the court 
the defense brief along with naming mcfarlane identifies the 
other unindicted coconspirators as fawn hall norths former 
secretary at the national security council joe fernandez a former 
cia agent also known as tomas castillo and marine lt col robert 
earl norths aide at the nsc 
hall and earl are cooperating with the investigation by 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh under grants of immunity from 
prosecution 
neither mcfarlanes lawyer leonard garment nor james wieghart 
a spokesman for walsh would comment on the defense revelations 
north former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard 
v secord all asked to be tried separately on charges stemming 
from their involvement in the diversion of usiran armssale 
profits to the contras 
in their motions for separate trials the defendants said they 
wanted to use the congressional testimony of their codefendants to 
prove their innocence 
a joint trial of all four defendants would unfairly prejudice 
the case against them because all the defendants except secord 
testified before congress under limited grants of immunity from 
prosecution the defense said 
the court must grant each defendant a separate trial to 
protect both the fifth amendment right of defendants north 
poindexter and hakim to be tried before a jury that has not been 
exposed to their immunized testimony or its fruits and the sixth 
amendment right of each defendant to use the immunized testimony of 
his codefendants and its fruits in his defense norths lawyers 
said in their brief 
the lawyers for north a former nsc aide noted a further 
complication involving mcfarlane who returned to the irancontra 
committee last year for additional questioning following norths 
appearance 
the defense noted that walsh acknowledged in a staff memo last 
summer that mcfarlanes testimony was likely tainted because it 
was given in direct response to lt col norths immunized 
testimony 
the ic independent counsel has also made clear that 
mcfarlane an alleged unindicted coconspirator will be a key 
prosecution witness the north brief said lt col norths 
codefendants are certainly entitled to crossexamine mcfarlane 
about his tainted testimony 
mcfarlane was identified in the defense brief as an unindicted 
coconspirator in the conspiracy to defraud the government count 
that charges all four defendants the brief says ms hall 
fernandez and earl are also unindicted coconspirators in that 
count of the indictment 
mcfarlane who resigned as national security adviser in late 
1995 traveled with north to tehran in may 1986 on a plane that 
delivered spare parts for hawk missiles mcfarlane carried a bible 
signed by president reagan and a cake in the shape of a key that 
were presented to the iranians in the negotiations to free hostages 
held in lebanon in exchange for arms sales to iran 
mcfarlane who is also cooperating with walshs investigation 
could receive a prison sentence of up to four years and a 400000 
fine for his guilty plea to misdemeanor charges of withholding 
information from various congressional committees that inquired 
into covert aid to the contras during a ban on direct us military 
assistance 
in other developments in the case the prosecution made another 
stab at obtaining nearly 3000 pages of diaries that north kept 
while he was at the nsc 
the recently retired marine lieutenant colonel last week invoked 
the fifth amendment when the diaries were subpoenaed by a senate 
foreign relations subcommittee 
walsh who has unsuccessfully tried to subpoena the material 
asked that they be produced as part of pretrial discovery for 
any and all notebooks journals or ledgers kept by the 
defendants 
the request also included documents of financial transactions 
involving a series of companies used by hakim and secord to broker 
arms to the iranians and to ferry materiel to the nicaraguan rebels 
walsh also accused the defense of ignoring us district judge 
gerhard a gesells order to specifically challenge the application 
of the classified information procedures act to the case 
the law sets out procedures for disclosure of secret government 
documents during a criminal trial walsh has amassed some 300000 
pages of classified documents in his investigation 
walsh contended that the defense did not attempt to 
substantiate the specific problems they had identified with 
complying with the law raising instead hypothetical and abstract 
arguments about the laws constitutionality

a bloody attack on a pub 
patronized by roman catholics inspired fear monday among catholic 
and protestant politicians of a return to the sectarian warfare of 
the 1970s 
the protestant action force an outlawed paramilitary group 
claimed responsibility for the lunchtime shooting sunday at the 
avenue pub in downtown belfast 
three people were killed and six wounded in an attack 
reminiscent of those in the 1970s by protestant paramilitary gangs 
that opened fire at random on catholicowned pubs businesses and 
homes 
politicians on both sides appealed for calm after sundays 
attack 
i dont want any innocent protestants to be killed as a result 
of this said patrick mcbride whose 27yearold brother paul was 
one of the three slain catholics 
brian feeney a city council member for the social democratic 
and labor party a moderate catholic group said he feared the 
murders were an attempt to revive the sectarian war 
there has to be a rapid and visible response from the police 
to protect people from these murderous exploits he said the 
whole object of this exercise is to instill maximum terror in the 
catholic community drive them off the streets back into their own 
ghettos 
cecil walker of the official unionist party the largest 
protestant political group said the killers were bent on 
creating havoc and sectarian strife in the community creating 
pandemonium and chaos 
ed maloney a cobiographer of the rev ian paisley leader of 
the hardline protestant democratic unionist party said protestant 
paramilitary groups have targeted catholic nationalists for 10 
years but sundays shooting smacks of the early and mid1970s an 
indiscriminate attack whose targets could only be innocent 
catholics 
the deaths of mcbride damien devlin 24 and stephen mcgahan 
27 bring to 28 the number of civilians killed this year at least 
2646 people have died since sectarian violence began in august 
1969 
in county tyrone on monday a parttime soldier in the largely 
protestant ulster defense regiment was seriously injured by a 
boobytrap bomb on a farm where he worked 
the irish republican army which is fighting to drive the 
british out of predominantly protestant northern ireland claimed 
responsibility there was no indication of a connection with the 
belfast shooting

gov michael dukakis leads george bush by 10 
points in their likely presidential contest in part on the 
strength of voters who say the democratic party is better able to 
handle key issues a poll said monday 
the 1382 adults interviewed in the cbs newsnew york times poll 
listed drugs unemployment and the federal deficit as the countrys 
most important problems and said democrats were better able to 
handle them 
partly as a result cbs news reported 49 percent said they 
would vote now for dukakis the democratic frontrunner to 39 
percent for bush who has clinched the republican nomination ten 
percent were undecided 
another new poll by louis harris amp associates gave dukakis a 
7point lead such polls are not predictive of a contest so far off 
as the november general election but they can provide a general 
sense of voter sympathies 
the cbstimes poll said 35 percent of the respondents had an 
unfavorable view of bush to 33 percent favorable dukakis rating 
was better 38 percent unfavorable 14 percent unfavorable 
however dukakis was less known 21 percent said they had not 
heard enough about him and another 26 percent were undecided about 
their opinion of him for bush all but 10 percent had heard 
enough and 21 percent were undecided 
dukakis outscored bush in several categories thirtyeight 
percent though of bush as too attached to special interests to 
only 17 percent who thought that of dukakis 
fiftyfive percent said they would be uneasy with bushs 
approach to a difficult international crisis 42 percent said that 
of dukakis fiftyfive percent said bush was tough enough to make 
hard choices but 65 percent said that of dukakis and 49 percent 
said bush was hiding something that the public ought to know 
about the irancontra affair 
respondents to the poll said the republicans would be better at 
dealing with the soviets and at keeping america strong but those 
were not cited by a sizable number of responents as key issues 
the most frequently cited issue was drugs and a plurality of 37 
percent said the democrats were better able to handle the problem 
an even bigger share 51 percent said democrats were better able 
to handle unemployment 
the cbstimes poll was conducted by telephone with a random 
nationwide sample of adults from may 912 and had a margin of 
sampling error of 3 points 
the harris poll of 2138 voters put the hypothetical race at 
50 percent for dukakis 43 percent for bush and 7 percent 
undecided that poll was done in two segments april 15 and may 
510 and also had a 3point error margin

reservation sen mark hatfield said monday 
hatfield rore said the general accounting office found the 
departments handling of information on iodine 129 contamination in 
the groundwater beneath the reservation in south central washington 
state was dominated by a pattern of activity that generally 
discouraged disseminating the information within or outside the 
agency 
at a news conference hatfield said the gao report wont be 
released until the energy department has had a chance to comment 
but hatfield said he was told in a briefing by officials of the 
congressional watchdog agency that the pattern of activity was so 
pervasive at doe that the information may never have been 
publicly released had not people outside the agency pursued the 
issue 
while the words cover up were not specifically used in the 
report i dont know of a better phrase to describe the 
actitvity hatfield said 
will callicott a doe spokesman said our own inspector 
generals office has looked at this before and could find nothing 
to substantiate any allegation of a cover up 
the environmental assessment of the hanford reservation was 
released in 1986 when hanford was under consideration as one of 
three sites for the nations first highlevel nuclear waste dump 
hatfield said there were indications that doe was well aware of 
the iodine contamination when it issued the environmental 
assessment though it made no mention of the problem 
we do not know specifically who orchestrated this situation 
but gao did inform us that there is no evidence to suggest that 
this activity was the result of directives from the upper echelons 
of doe hatfield said i suspect there were individuals who 
didnt want the truth known 
hatfield said someone at doe decided the information on the 
iodine contamination was not important enough to include in the 
environmental report he also suggested the omission may have been 
aimed at casting hanford in a favorable light to validate the 
departments selection of the reservation as a possible site for 
the nuclear waste repository 
along with reps ron wyden dore and al swift dwash 
hatfield requested the gao investigation last summer after doe 
finally released information on the iodine contamination at the 
hanford reservation

dukakis who expects to win the lions share of 45 delegates at 
stake in oregon we all knew what we were doing and what we were 
running against

press total delegate count 1610 to 956 as well as the super 
delegate tally 203 to 52

and close the gap in the delegate count 
super does not mean following the tail wind he said 
super means bucking the head wind

a harris poll that found him leading bush in a trial heat of the 
likely presidential contest

surveyed in telephone interviews april 15 and may 510 bush was 
favored by 43 percent of those polled and 7 percent were undecided

defended himself against charges that one of his top aides was

the countrys largest black 
labor federation on monday called for a threeday worker stayaway 
june 68 and for regular weekly demonstrations to protest recent 
government crackdowns 
the congress of south african trade unions which claims 691000 
duespaying members said its weekend special session was marked 
by a mood of worker militancy and anger 
the session attended by 1500 delegates was called in response 
to the governments february decision barring the federation from 
taking part in political activity and banning 17 other 
antiapartheid groups from functioning in any capacity 
federation officials also are angered by a proposed labor 
relations amendment that would severely curtail unions ability to 
stage legal strikes and would make them liable for damages suffered 
by a company that is the target of a strike 
the federation statement monday called for june 68 to be days 
of peaceful demonstration the federation cannot explicitly 
call for a strike but similar pleas in the past resulted in 
widespread worker stayaways 
the congress of south african trade unions also called for 
stepping up demonstrations in all organized factories every 
tuesday the statement did not elaborate but would appear to 
call for brief weekly demonstrations or sitdown strikes 
federation officials could not be reached by telephone for 
additional comment 
under current law management can fire workers even when they 
are staging legal strikes the new bill would expand the powers of 
management and government to prevent or halt strikes 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

attorney richard racehorse haynes 
who won acquittal in oilman cullen davis murder trial here 11 
years ago gave opening arguments monday for a woman accused of 
plotting to kill her boss wife 
davis a fort worth millionaire was accused of killing his 
stepdaughter andrea wilborn this time haynes represents jane ada 
calloway in the murder of judy saragusa 39 who was shot to death 
at home in houston on sept 2 1987 
ms calloway a twicedivorced 36yearold and the former 
executive secretary of businessman michael saragusa is accused of 
hiring leon hawkins jr to kill mrs saragusa 
during pretrial hearings saragusa admitted he had had an affair 
with ms callaway but said it had ended two months before his 
wifes slaying in the bedroom of the couples mansion 
ms calloway is free on 50000 bail and had to be ordered by a 
judge to stop telephoning her exboss 
after police identified a car seen leaving the murder scene as 
belonging to ms calloway she said she lent her car to michael 
richardson the alleged middleman in the murder plot on the night 
of the shooting 
richardson has agreed to testify for the state under a plea 
bargain in exchange for a 10year prison term said his attorney 
john ackerman 
richardsons stepbrother leon hawkins jr surrendered to 
police two days after the shooting and was charged with capital 
murder 
haynes said the trial may develop a lot more questions than 
are answered but said there are others who had motives to kill 
mrs saragusa 
haynes said ms calloway was used by her boss to handle his 
mounting personal bills and run them through the company 
quality beverage co of houston 
following the killing haynes said her loyalty to saragusa led 
her to protect him by lying to police about her love affair with 
him and about the car seen leaving the murder scene haynes said 
saragusa began the affair with ms calloway and was involved in 
an unhappy marriage haynes said and mrs saragusa was 
domineering and abrasive and created discussion in quality 
beverage about her sexual practices which annoyed mr michael 
saragusa 
his wife who was contributing to saragusas 4 million to 5 
million debt spent most evenings with her horses and a female 
friend haynes said 
judy spent thousands and thousands on her horses and 
remodeling the couples 1 million houston home he said 
ms calloway was portrayed in opening arguments as a capable 
secretary who craved wealth and status and a perfect sitting 
duck who was pursued and seduced by her unhappily married 
employer to whom she had great loyalty 
prosecutor chuck rosenthal said ms calloway wanted mrs 
saragusa dead because she was covetous of her possessions and 
covetous of her social position in houston 
she wanted the wealth and status associated with being the wife 
of a wealthy coowner of the lucrative wholeale liquor business he 
said 
saragusas finances were expected to be a principal component of 
both defense and prosecution testimony with several houston 
bankers on the witness list 
rosenthal charged that ms calloway who had the authority to 
transfer money among saragusas accounts transferred 135000 the 
month before the slaying to an account she controlled and used some 
of the money to pay hawkins 
haynes said that despite a 400000 annual salary saragusa 
faced mounting debts and was sometimes overdrawn several thousand 
dollars at the bank 
testimony is expected to last more than a month state district 
judge michael mcspadden ruled that a gag order issued before the 
trial for attorneys and witnesses continue during court 
proceedings 
the murder case was moved here from houston on a change of 
venue the same circumstance that brought haynes from fort worth to 
defend davis in 1977

denmarks political crisis deepened 
monday when talks broke down to draw up a foreign and domestic 
policy program for a new coalition government 
svend jakobsen the neutral mediator charged with sounding out 
eight parties on a national program said he could not bring enough 
parties together to form a stable government and was giving up his 
task 
the impasse arose from last tuesdays deadlocked parliamentary 
election fought over denmarks nonnuclear policy and its loyalty 
to nato 
prime minister poul schlueters centerright minority coalition 
kept its 70 seats in the 179member legislature the twoparty 
socialist opposition lost ground but still held 79 seats and kept 
schlueter from forming a new government schlueter continues as 
caretaker premier 
jakobsen said he was reporting to queen margrethe ii on his 
three rounds of inconclusive talks he refused to talk about future 
negotiations saying its no longer my mandate 
schlueter probably will seek approval to try to form a new 
government 
but social democratic leader svend auken told national 
television he would propose that niels helveg petersen of the 
socialliberals a 10seat swing party lead new negotiations 
earlier it appeared the social democrats denmarks largest 
single party was on the verge of a coalition deal with the 
socialist peoples party its junior partner in the opposition and 
the socialliberals but their talks failed 
the four parties in schlueters coalition are the conservatives 
liberals center democrats and christian peoples party 
negotiations so far have ignored the farright progress party 
the only group to gain significantly in the election with a jump 
from nine seats to 16 
the political maneuvers overshadowed a security policy wrangle 
that prompted schlueter to call the early election only eight 
months after the last vote 
on april 14 the socialist opposition pushed a resolution 
through parliament calling on schlueters government to notify 
visiting warships of denmarks peacetime ban on nuclear weapons 
the government voted against the resolution and refused to 
implement it 
america and britain pointed to their policies of never 
confirming or denying the presence of nuclear weapons on their 
warcraft 
north atlantic treaty organization countries were awaiting the 
outcome of party negotiations to see how a new government coalition 
will resolve the crisis in the alliance over denmarks nuclear 
policy

jesse jackson stepped up his appeal for 
fairness from the democratic party on monday and said he deserved 
credit for registering more democrats than anybody else in 
history 
were not discussing generosity were discussing 
reciprocity jackson said to the cheers of about 200 supporters 
at a breakfast address 
the democratic presidential contender spoke out against party 
rules that have made his delegate total disproportionately smaller 
than his share of the popular vote he called for one person one 
vote and asked the socalled super delegates to close the 
gap in the delegate count jackson trails frontrunner michael 
dukakis by more than 650 delegates 
super delegates are elected leaders and party officials who 
comprise almost a third of the number needed to win nomination at 
the july convention in atlanta super delegates have been moving 
steadily into dukakis column 
super does not mean following the tail wind super means 
bucking the head wind jackson said 
jackson told new jersey campaign leaders that he has helped 
elect many senators and representatives by registering more 
democrats than anybody else in history and that he deserved a 
return on my investment in the party 
jackson claims credit for registering 2 million new voters in 
1984 and after many of them black 
he implied that his work registering voters helped elect new 
jersey sen bill bradley a former professional basketball player 
who has pledged his support for dukakis 
you dont become senator because you could shoot a basketball 
you become a senator because people invested in you said jackson 
jackson continued his theme of the last several days for 
reciprocity from the party but said his appeal for fairness 
was not a veiled threat 
my focus now is not to be accusatory but to make our basic 
appeal which is one of reasonable expecations fairness jackson 
said at a news conference after his speech 
later jackson flew to oregon to make a primaryeve appeal for 
votes there are 45 delegates at stake in the states primary on 
tuesday 
i want to win in oregon on tomorrow and take that momentum to 
california debate bush three times and send reagan and bush out 
of washington on the same plane he said at an airport rally in 
eugene 
if i make the most sense to you vote for me jackson urged 
the crowd if i win you win

they have restored diplomatic ties and said they want to resolve 
the western sahara dispute that has separated them for 12 years 
a joint statement issued in rabat and algiers said relations 
were being reestablished immediately at the ambassadorial level 
it noted the action followed meetings over the past week in the 
two capitals 
the north african neighbors severed diplomatic ties on march 7 
1976 after algeria recognized the western sahara as the western 
saharan democratic republic morocco had annexed the territory the 
former spanish sahara in 1975 
algeria has sheltered and backed polisario front guerrillas 
fighting morocco for independence of the western sahara 
the joint statement said reestablishment of ties was aimed at 
contributing to the construction of the arab maghreb a unified 
north africa and at endorsing the united nations effort to hold a 
referendum on selfdetermination in the disputed territory 
it said the referendum could offer a just and definitive 
solution 
the announcement precedes a scheduled june 7 arab summit meeting 
in algiers to discuss the palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories 
it said morocca and algeria have a firm wish to contribute to 
the strengthening of arab ranks around the sacred cause of the 
palestinian people by reinforcing their heroic uprising in the 
occupied territories 
fighting between the polisario guerrillas and moroccan soldiers

syria massed troops and tanks monday for 
a push into beiruts southern slums after shiite moslem militias 
defied a ceasefire order from the syrian army and dueled with 
howitzers mortars and rocket launchers 
there was no word on when the syrians would enter lebanese army 
sources said the syrians were taking their time in hopes the 
proiranian hezbollah which controls nearly all the slums could 
be persuaded not to resist 
police said the hezbollah or party of god and the 
syrianbacked amal militias fought through the day in the enclave 
where 18 western hostages including nine americans are believed 
held by proiranian extremists 
they said amal driven to the slum fringes in 11 days of combat 
made a counterattack monday that forced hezbollah to retreat in the 
shiyah neighborhood 
its a significant development but not enough to turn the 
tables on the victorious hezbollah said a police offical who 
spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with regulations 
only the syrians can crush hezbollah 
police said 14 people were killed and 120 wounded in fighting 
sunday and monday raising the toll to 225 dead and 706 wounded 
since fighting for control of the 16 square miles of slums began 
may 6 
most of the hostages are believed held by kidnappeers linked to 
hezbollah and the united states indicated monday it would be 
willing to talk with the captors 
state department spokesman charles redman asked about reports 
that the hostages had been moved from the slums said i dont 
have anything to say about their whereabouts we would only be 
concerned obviously if this kind of fighting were to endanger the 
hostages 
he said washington was pleased by a call from the spiritual 
guide of hezbollah sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah for 
negotiations about the hostages and said we will talk to anyone 
to any group to any government about the wellbeing and release 
of the americans still held hostage in lebanon 
in beirut the iranian embassy repeated its denial of a report 
by the voice of lebanon a christian radio station that most of 
the hostages had been moved to the embassy grounds outside the 
battle zone 
syrian commanders deployed thousands of soldiers and hundreds of 
armored vehicles at the gateways to the labyrinthine slums beside 
the beirut airport 
mem and machines began massing two days ago under brig gen ali 
deeb and brig gen hisham moalla said to be syrias toughest 
generals 
they commanded crackdowns on fundamentalist moslems in the hama 
syria in 1981 in which up to 30000 people were reported killed 
and in north lebanons port of tripoli in 1985 
deeb and moalla had two armored brigades entrenched in sand 
dunes around the airport monday with their artillery and tank 
cannons trained on the slums 
the syrians also want the predominantly shiite 6th brigade of 
the lebanese army to go in with them to minimize the risk of coming 
under hezbollah fire the sources said 
if there is a chance of confrontation then the syrians will 
change their tactics they will level the slums with artillery 
before moving in one military source said he spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the sources estimated the syrian buildup at about 7500 soldiers 
and 500 tanks and armored vehicles 
syrias military intelligence chief brig gen ghazi kenaan 
ordered hezbollah and amal to lay down their arms warning our 
forces will shoot without hesitation at any gunman in the street or 
in buildings your lives will be spared if you comply 
amals leader nabih berri who is also lebanons justice 
minister has declared support for a syrian entry into the slums 
radio stations said he had decided to disband his 6000strong 
militia in the suburbs and neighboring west beirut saying no 
gunmen should be allowed to remain in the suburbs and beirut now 
that a legitimate force is taking charge of security 
fadlallah said sunday that all the suburbs will be destroyed 
if the syrians attempt to enter by force 
that would sharpen the strain on an alliance between syria and 
iran which has been imperiled by hezbollahs efforts to dominate 
the 12 million shiites in lebanon 
the syrians have 25000 troops based in northern and eastern 
lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
they also deployed 7500 troops in west beirut in february 1987 
to curb three years of militia violence 
but in an apparent effort to avoid a collision with iran the 
syrians did not venture into the slums then 
irans acting foreign minister ali mohammed besharati was in 
damascus on monday for talks with syrian officials on the lebanon 
crisis irans islamic republic news agency reported in a dispatch 
that was monitored in cyprus 
besharati later went to beirut and met separately with fadlallah 
and sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin head of the supreme shiite 
council the sects highest religious body in the presence of 
irans ambassadors to syria and lebanon 
a statement from the iranian embassy said besharati was trying 
to resurrect a fourman committee representing the presidents of 
iran and syria as well as amal and hezbollah to end the slums war

the mayor of san francisco asked the navy on 
monday to revise its plans for basing the battleship missouri in 
his city but the civilian head of the service later rejected the 
idea 
navy secretary william ball told mayor art agnos that he expects 
the city to fulfill commitments made last year to help pay for 
dredging and facilities for the battleship or else the missouri 
and its battle group wont be coming to the city a navy spokesman 
said late monday 
cmdr jeff zakem the spokesman released a statement saying 
the fulfillment by the city and county of san francisco of the 
commitments in the memorandum of understanding was necessary in 
order to proceed with the navys plan for homeporting a battleship 
battle group in san francisco 
secretary ball advised the mayor of his disappointment that 
the agreement negotiated in august 1987 would not be honored by the 
city in the navys view the terms of the memorandum of 
understanding with the city were such that san francisco and the 
bay area would have received substantial economic benefits from 
homeporting 
agnos told reporters monday he would like to see the navy base 
the huge battleship itself at some other nearby port while placing 
the smaller escorts at a rebuilt hunters point shipyard as 
originally planned 
the smaller warships would not require the extensive dredging 
needed for the battleship easing environmental concerns the mayor 
said 
moreover the city would like the navy to renegotiate the 
memorandum of understanding so that a more balanced mix of 
industry office and residential buildings can be developed at 
hunters point 
the navy has balked at that idea saying the activation of a 
naval station there for the missouri battle group would not allow 
civilian businesses to stay but that the city would benefit through 
the creation of new jobs and economic activity to support the fleet 
pentagon officials who asked not to be named said monday the 
proposal by agnos might kill for good the assignment of a 
battleship battle group to san francisco 
but reps barbara boxer dcalif and nancy pelosi dcalif 
endorsed the mayors efforts saying the navy should consider a 
compromise 
i want to commend him for taking a positive approach boxer 
said in an interview monday 
hes not antinavy as some people have suggested pelosi 
said we want hunters point to be developed in an environmentally 
sound manner 
agnos assumed office on jan 8 replacing dianne feinstein who 
had been a strong proponent of basing the ship in san francisco 
the navy originally planned to get the missouri in san francisco 
by 1990 that schedule has slipped because of congressional budget 
cuts at the same time the navy has been waiting to see whether 
agnos would honor the earlier memorandum 
beyond the extra dredging required for a battleship agnos said 
the navys original plan would force the eviction of 200 small 
businesses with 1000 employees and payrolls totaling 20 million 
a pentagon source said monday he wasnt sure the service would 
be interested in renegotiating last years agreement to accommodate 
agnos 
san francisco signed an agreement with the navy we didnt 
force them to do that said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity

the keepers of clarinetist benny goodmans 
musical legacy on monday unveiled a trove of performances by the 
king of swing not previously available to collectors 
a lilting playful swinging version of sweet georgia brown 
driven by goodmans clarinet and spiced with a zoot sims saxophone 
solo reverberated through a conference room of the yale club 
the number was the first cut in a 50minute recording released 
by yale university and musicmasters at a news conference in the 
club 
before now that performance had been heard only by diners at 
the rainbow grill in rockefeller center in june 1967 it was part 
of 400 unreleased tapes goodman bequeathed to yale when he died two 
years ago 
yale music professor harold e samuel said the new album is a 
sampler of the tapes in the goodman archive future releases will 
be devoted wholly to particular playing dates or recording sessions 
samuel described the performances as a more spontaneous 
relaxed benny goodman than you would find on many of his other 
recordings 
selections on the record include if i had you from a 1955 
gig at basin street east in 1955 poor butterfly at the 1958 
brussels world fair and cherokee taped at park recording co 
in 1958 but never released 
the album closes with a fletcher henderson arrangement of blue 
room performed by a goodman band that included drummer louie 
bellson and trumpeter randy sandke 
i never stop being thrilled by this music said goodmans 
daughter rachel edelson who said she wants to make new 
generations aware of the scope of his contributions to the field 
of music 
my children at age 8 and 4 are learning it very very well 
she said sometimes they complain about listening to it all the 
time but i want them to know it and i play it nonstop 
she said that except for a scene in the 1938 movie hollywood 
hotel no film exists of the quartet composed of goodman drummer 
gene krupa pianist teddy wilson and vibraphonist lionel hampton 
because moviemakers then would not show black and white players 
together 
i knew about my father being the first white musician to have 
hired blacks but i simply had not been aware of the level of 
resistance that he met and that he simply didnt care about mrs 
edelson said 
royalties from the new releases will pay the cost of maintaining 
the goodman archive which in addition to the tapes contain 1500 
arrangements 5000 photographs scrapbooks and other memorabilia 
goodman died in 1986 
yale already has cataloged and indexed the arrangements which 
samuel said will be a boon to performers and scholars for 
generations to come 
preserving the tapes dating from the 1950s has been the first 
order of business samuel said most of the 1950s tapes are acetate 
and must preserved on sturdier digital stock 
there might be only one playing left on some of the acetates 
and that one playing has to be a transfer onto more permanent 
material he said 
identifying the performances and choosing the best for 
commercial release is being done by loren schoenberg an authority 
on goodmans work 
goodman was a fantastic perfectionist and we have an 
obligation to him not to release anything that he would not have 
released himself said samuel 
the albums are being marketed in the three popular formats 
long playing record tape cassette and compact disc

attorney general edwin meese iii fired the 
justice departments chief spokesman for allegedly not defending 
him aggressively enough and the head of meeses speechwriting 
unit then abruptly handed in his resignation monday 
in a letter justice department spokesman terry eastland said he 
had been relieved of his duties friday and that he had defended 
meese to the best of my ability while exercising good 
judgment and acting in a manner consistent with the obligations of 
this office 
you have concluded that my efforts have not sufficed 
eastland wrote the attorney general who had appointed him public 
affairs director in april 1985 
in explaining eastlands dismissal meese told reporters 
basically i decided this was a good time for a change in 
leadership this was a matter basically of my determination that 
for the rest of the year we could use some new leadership and he 
was agreeable to that 
at a news conference eastland said he felt no anger at all 
toward the attorney general that he had no indication before late 
last week that meese was displeased with his work and that meese 
made no suggestion of moving eastland to another job in the 
department 
eastland said that with meese under criminal investigation for 
the past year it would be difficult for me to be as aggressive 
as he might like 
independent counsel james mckay is expected to issue a report 
raising numerous questions about meeses ethical behavior sources 
familiar with the probe have said and someone like me could not 
be indifferent to what might be contained or flow from the 
independent counsels report said eastland 
meese immediately replaced eastland with his no 2 spokesman 
patrick korten who told reporters he intends to be very 
aggressive about every part of the job 
meeses ethical conduct has been entirely aboveboard said 
korten i think hes a very ethical man i think hes a very 
moral man 
eastland 38 is a staunch political conservative who has helped 
craft many of meeses most controversial speeches on subjects 
ranging from civil rights policies to criticisms of supreme court 
rulings 
his dismissal is the latest in a string of departures that began 
march 29 when deputy attorney general arnold burns and criminal 
division chief william weld quit out of concern that meeses 
continued tenure as attorney general in the face of a criminal 
probe was hurting the justice departments operations morale and 
public image 
meese has been the focus of a criminal investigation by 
independent counsel james mckay launched on may 11 1987 into the 
attorney generals ties to scandalplagued wedtech corp and his 
involvement with a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline 
three hours after eastland publicly released the letter to 
meese the associate head of the public affairs office william 
schambra quit as head of the unit that prepares speeches for the 
attorney general 
i am perplexed and deeply disturbed by the attorney 
generals decision schambra said in a resignation letter to 
eastland this department simply could not have asked for more 
conscientious and effective a spokesman it is simply 
astonishing to me that this formed the grounds for your 
dismissal schambra had held his post less than four months 
bill schambra quit because he found that the attorney 
generals firing of terry eastland to be unconscionable that it 
was something that terry did not deserve that it inflicts great 
harm on the principles that everyone came here to fight for said 
gary l mcdowell meeses former speechwriter 
several prominent conservatives expressed dismay over the firing 
education secretary william bennett who once wrote a book with 
eastland on the bakke affirmative action case immediately offered 
eastland a job at the department of education 
i am concerned about this latest development sen strom 
thurmond of south carolina the ranking republican on the senate 
judiciary committee said in a statement 
thurmond saying that eastland has a fine reputation added 
that the committee would hold hearings after mckay issues a report 
that is expected to raise numerous questions about meeses ethical 
behavior 
at a meeting friday meese told eastland he had been hearing 
both inside and outside the justice department that the spokesman 
felt uncomfortable defending him said department sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
meese also said he had heard that eastland was uneasy over 
the likelihood that mckays report will question meeses ethical 
behavior the sources said 
eastland told meese that he had made no judgments about the 
attorney general and that he would make none until the report is 
issued according to the sources meese responded that he didnt 
want that kind of person being the chief spokesman for the justice 
department 
in his letter to meese eastland said you have expressed to 
me your desire to have as director of public affairs someone 
willing to aggressively defend you against in effect any and all 
criticism 
eastland added that the public affairs office has an 
obligation to serve not only the attorney general but also the 
department of justice and the american people 
in fridays conversation meese went on to criticize eastland 
for not responding aggressively enough to editorial criticism of 
the attorney generals continued tenure meese then gave eastland 
30 days to look for work and offered to throw him a goingaway 
party said the sources 
eastland declined the offer and monday was his last day at work 
the central figure pushing for eastlands dismissal was meeses 
former counselor ken cribb who now heads the white house office 
of domestic affairs according to other justice department sources 
cribb denied he played a role in the firing 
that is an utter fabrication and you will find that it 
doesnt check out he said the attorney general is entitled to 
make personnel decisions and i support him in that 
however the sources emphasized that cribb for several weeks has 
been questioning eastlands loyalty to meese and whether the 
attorney general ought to jettison him 
meanwhile despite the departments annual 17 million public 
affairs budget the justice department is negotiating a contract 
with charles crawford of the washington office of the public 
relations firm hill amp knowlton to help meese tout his efforts in 
the departments war on drugs 
ive always felt that whoever had eastlands position had 
too much to do on a daytoday basis to spend much time on 
departmental problems said hill amp knowltons chairman bob gray 
who emphasized that the contract is to be a 60day arrangement with 
crawford personally on drug enforcement and not a contract with 
me or the firm

vice president george bush stepped away monday 
from reagan administration policies on acid rain saying the time 
for study is over and weve got to begin to take effective 
action 
i dont think weve been doing enough to protect our 
environment in recent years he said we need to do more 
bush the republican nomineetobe also lashed out on monday at 
the most recent story suggesting his staff was involved in an arms 
and drugs network involving the nicaraguan contra rebels calling 
it the oldest tiredest reporting 
he denounced the story in newsweek that suggested his foreign 
policy aide donald gregg was the washington contact for an arms 
operation supplying the contras with links to drug dealers 
this is old news he said its not even news you get 
bombarded by these insinuations and tired stories id hate to 
think it is politically motivated material that has been looked 
at 
its just pure unadulterated ive go to watch my lanuage 
later he told local reporters in seattle i think its 
slanderous and its all been looked into 
bush said he did not believe the report woulld hurt his campaign 
no i am not hurt and it doesnt happen to be true he said 
ive learned to defend yourself and not let somebody libel or 
slander you 
on the subject of acid rain bush said specific goals to cut 
down on the air pollution that contributes to it may well be 
needed administration policy is to continue to study acid rain 
aides had promoted the speech to the greater seattle chamber 
of commerce as a major statement on the environment a key theme 
of bushs campaign in the pacific northwest 
a bush administration will enforce environmental laws 
aggressively putting the responsibility for the cleanup where it 
belongs on those who caused the problem in the first place he 
said 
an earlier text of the speech was handed out by his staff but 
then was hurriedly retrieved with the explanation that the text was 
not a final one just before bush started speaking another text 
was distributed with no word on possible changes 
bush has been bringing up the subject of the environment both in 
speeches and in actions on this weeklong campaign swing which has 
appeared to be aimed mostly at the general election in the fall he 
has campaigned in oregon in advance of the tuesday primary there 
and late monday he headed to california which has its primary on 
june 7 
washington has already held its precinct caucuses and bush 
suffered his sole loss on super tuesday here 
on monday he toured a major forestry reserach lab and a lumber 
mill near seattle 
as he has recently bush spoke favorably of teddy roosevelt 
declaring i am proud of the leadership shown by republicans on 
protecting the environment 
but he moved away from president reagans policies on acid rain 
as he seemed to suggest he would change much about reagans much 
criticized environmental policies 
with regard to acid rain we cant study the problem any more 
weve got to begin to take effective action bush said there 
has to be a national commitment to continue to reduce the emissions 
of sulfur and nitrogen oxides 
bush went on to say that he would pursue initiatives that have 
come from the negotiations with canada on acid rain and if they 
do not produce results establish specific emission reduction goals 
that promise steady progress toward cleaner air 
he endorsed the administrations 5 billion program to develop 
new technologies to cut emissions from coal and other sources of 
acid rain 
bush spokesman peter teeley said the acid rain position is 
different from reagans 
the vice president seemed to suggest he would clean house at the 
environmental protection agency 
a new administration is a time for change a time for renewal 
i will put the very best people we can find to work on our 
environmental agenda i want to bring a lot of people to washington 
who dont know what they cant do bush said 
bush also endorsed many of the recommendations of the 
presidents commission on americans outdoors a study that has not 
been officially released by the reagan white house 
however teeley said bush has not agreed to the commissions 
call for spending 1 billion in new federal money a year on outdoor 
facilities and parks over the weekend bush had made statements 
supporting the commissions work without including any 
qualifications 
on another subject asked about democrat michael dukakis charge 
that the new jobs created under reagan have been largely lowwage 
ones bush said 
hes wrong the jobs that have been created are for the most 
part good jobs the charge that the new jobs are flipping 
hamburgers and doing someone elses laundry are wrong

senate republican leader bob dole asked the 
senate on monday night to oppose any us deal with manuel noriega 
which would involve dropping criminal charges against the 
panamanian strongman 
the american people are never going to understand if we 
dismiss indictments against noriega the kansas republican told 
his colleagues as he introduced a nonbinding resolution opposing 
any deal in which charges are dropped 
there have been numerous reports in recent days that reagan 
administration officials were negotiating an agreement with noriega 
where he would voluntarily step down and relinquish power if the 
united states would drop federal drug trafficking indictments that 
were brought against him in february by grand juries in miami and 
tampa fla 
doles proposal was a sense of the senate resolution which 
he introduced as an amendment to a pending bill authorizing 
pentagon spending for the fiscal year which begins oct 1 
the senate originally considered voting on the resolution monday 
night but delayed a vote until at least tuesday when sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee objected 
nunn said he wanted to talk with members of the senate foreign 
relations committee 
dole said he had no personal knowledge about the accuracy of the 
reports of the proposed deal but he referred to them as a golden 
parachute for noriega 
if we send this signal its going to undermine the socalled 
war on drugs said dole let noriega go but lets dont send 
him off with a legal golden parachute 
golden parachute is often the term used to describe benefits and 
severance pay offered to top business executives when they are 
fired or resign 
we all want noriega to go said dole we all agree that 
should be a high priority of american policy in panama but it is 
not the only priority for american policy 
if we let noriega off the hook on the drug indictments that 
have been brought against him no matter what the motive we have 
sent a very regrettable message to the world added dole 
sen alfonse damato rny called the proposed deal 
scandalous and said all were doing is rewarding him were 
giving him a pardon 
this administration is doing itself in said damato who 
then went on to praise president reagan as a good man a 
courageous man 
i dont think the american people want us to drop these 
charges and give testimony to the effectiveness of the colombian 
drug cartel and manuel noriega said damato 
nunn said he believes that you dont indict a leader of a 
foreign country unless you know how youre going to follow through 
on it apparently we did not have ways to go about it plans for 
extradition 
certainly weve dug ourselves into a hole now said nunn 
dropping the charges is sending a very bad signal

the number of confirmed cases of aids 
increased from 4101 in 1986 to 9328 last year in the european 
economic community the european commission reported monday 
the commission which gave no breakdown by country said it 
regretted slow action on the part of the eec in fighting aids and 
meager funds spent so far for common research and coordination of 
measures among the 12 member countries 
it said only 17 million was allocated last year on research in 
europe and fighting the disease in africa and these funds are being 
used 
the commission report said 23 million had been earmarked for 
research in the two continents but most of those funds were only 
tentatively allocated and not yet used as part of a fiveyear 
medical research program just recently decided 
eec health ministers will review the issue at their next 
brussels meeting on may 31 
aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in 
which a virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers

senate majority leader robert c byrd 
announced monday he will call up the ussoviet mediumrange 
missile treaty for debate tuesday opening a race to ratify it 
before president reagan meets with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev at the moscow summit 
byrd acted after three senate committees formally concluded that 
disputes over the onsite inspection provisions of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty have been resolved and no 
longer prevent opening debate on ratifying the pact 
the decision followed testimony in which secretary of state 
george p shultz said that in talks last week with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze on the disputed points we got what 
we needed and wanted 
byrd told reporters that on the recommendation of the chairmen 
and senior republican members of the senate foreign relations 
intelligence and armed services committees i feel satisfied that 
were justified in taking up the treaty and i plan to do so at some 
point tomorrow 
the inf treaty signed at the white house on dec 8 by reagan 
and gorbachev would require the elimination of all us and soviet 
missiles with a range of between 300 and 3400 miles 
byrd had refused to permit debate on ratifying the pact to 
proceed until disputes on implementing the onsite inspection 
provision and on futuristic weapons had been resolved 
on monday night byrd said he hoped the treaty could be ratified 
by the may 29 opening of the moscow summit but he could not 
guarantee it 
finishing the treaty by the time of the summit will depend on 
the nature of the debate and the number of amendments that are 
offered he said 
i am in no position at this point to say we can finish or we 
wont finish byrd said i hope we can but nobody can answer 
that at this point 
byrd said he plans to call up the treaty and stay on it but 
noted there may be some roadblocks 
for example he said that if reagan vetoes the trade bill an 
attempt to override that action would take precedence over the 
treaty and would interrupt its consideration 
in addition a small band of treaty opponents led by sen jesse 
helms rnc has vowed to mount a drive to make substantial 
changes in the pact changes that would force the renegotiation of 
the accord helms who denied that his objective was to delay 
action on the treaty until after the summit said last week that he 
plans to offer something like a dozen amendments 
such antitreaty amendments are given little chance of adoption 
vote counts show that when the final vote is taken the treaty 
likely will be ratified by an overwhelming senate majority far 
greater than the required twothirds vote 
sen sam nunn dga the armed services chairman said he was 
satisfied by the agreement worked out between shultz and 
shevardnadze in geneva and said i believe they have done a good 
job in satisfying the very serious problems that were raised 
sen david boren dokla the intelligence committee chairman 
told reporters that the committees concluded that the 
shultzshevardnadze talks resolved all nine disputed points 
regarding the implementation of onsite inspection as well as a 
dispute over whether the treaty embraces such futuristic weapons as 
those using laser rays and particle beam generators 
it is the feeling that these points that have been in dispute 
now have been resolved boren said adding he was speaking for 
the armed services committee as well as his own 
shultz earlier appealed to the senate to ratify the treaty 
before the summit and said that all nine outstanding onsite 
inspection issues have been resolved to our satisfaction 
he told the senate foreign relations committee that in dealing 
with disputes with the soviets on the implementation of onsite 
inspection arrangements to detect cheating what we did was 
insist that precisely the terms of the treaty be lived up to on 
both sides 
as a result of the talks with shevardnadze we and the soviets 
not only agree on the rights and obligations established in this 
treaty but also on procedures to carry them out he said 
it is clear shultz asserted that the treaty is in the national 
security interests of the united states because it removes 
forever a soviet nuclear threat that has confronted our nato 
allies for 30 years 
responding to questions shultz said a recent soviet test of a 
sealaunched cruise missile from a landbased launcher does not 
appear to violate the treaty for two reasons one of them being the 
fact the treaty is not yet in effect 
the other shultz said is that the test appears to have fallen 
short of 300 miles and therefore does not fall within the treatys 
definition of a mediumrange missile 
but helms citing news accounts of the test insisted it 
represents a treaty violation and said it makes him wonder why we 
are even talking about giving assent to ratification at all 
us officials said the soviets had retreated from a hardline 
position on how the onsite inspection would work and would now 
permit inspectors to look inside any container or vehicle large 
enough to contain the smallest stage of any banned missile or large 
enough to hold a partially completed ss20 missile 
inspectors also will be allowed to use cameras and to look 
inside any building or container inside a facility covered by the 
treaty officials said 
failure to consent to the ratification of the treaty by may 29 
would virtually eliminate any chances reagan might have for making 
progress on a treaty aimed at reducing longrange strategic nuclear 
weapons by as much as 50 percent treaty supporters contend

the last two hostages in a 
mediumsecurity prison were released unharmed monday peacefully 
ending a 59hour uprising in which inmates took eight guards 
captive and did more than 1 million damage 
the siege at mack alford correctional facility ended about 1030 
am when the inmates released sgt harold yoder then surrendered 
the other remaining hostage corrections officer ronnie scott was 
freed about a halfhour earlier 
for all practical purposes its over prison spokesman 
jerry massie said as friends and relatives greeted the former 
hostages and nine inmates were stripsearched dressed in red 
coveralls and loaded on a bus 
one guard and one inmate were injured in the violence that broke 
out friday night at the 33yearold prison fortytwo other 
prisoners suspected of aiding the nine also would be transferred 
from the prison officials said 
we assume that they were all involved in the riot they were 
the ones who were left with the hostages said corrections 
director gary maynard 
some took more of a leadership role and others stood back 
well have to sort that out later he said 
maynard said estimates of 12 million in damage to the prison 
didnt include damage to a threestory dormitory gutted by fire at 
the start of the uprising he planned to compile a complete damage 
assessment 
the property is scattered probably been rummaged through by 
everybody maynard said there was more fire damage than i 
expected its very discouraging and frustrating 
we will subsequent to this do the best that we can to rebuild 
and replace 
reporters found extensive fire damage and vandalism in three of 
the prisons four dormitories broken glass and debris covered 
floors and the prison yard where inmates burned chairs and other 
materials in bonfires 
the nine captors had demanded that they be moved to other 
prisons and that their departure be recorded by television cameras 
said joy hadwiger corrections spokeswoman in oklahoma city 
there was no agreement made on where they would be transferred 
she said 
the bus pulled out of the parking lot at 1120 am bound for 
the lexington assessment and reception center warden stephen 
kaiser said they would be housed in maximumsecurity facilities 
the former hostages were examined and then allowed to go home 
we had faith in the lord and we had peace of mind there 
said bessie umsted yoders sisterinlaw 
prison spokeswoman anita trammell said 30 to 35 inmates who were 
not involved in the hostagetaking and remained in their cells 
during the standoff will remain at the stringtown facility 
they will be contained stripped fed and watered she said 
we are going to determine who participated in the hostage 
situation who set fires 
the 51 stringtown inmates heading to other facilities would be 
dispersed throughout the system wherever we can maynard said 
corrections officials who swept through the building after 
regaining control said early reports that a dead inmate was inside 
were false 
weve finished our head count and everyones accounted for 
said ms hadwiger there is no body 
according to authorities the uprising began friday when 
officers tried to move five inmates to a maximumsecurity prison 
because of a dispute between them and some other inmates 
the inmates initially seized eight hostages all prison guards 
but five were released unharmed saturday and on sunday a sixth 
was set free in exchange for soda pop ice cream and cigarettes 
the rioters agreed sunday night to release the final two 
hostages and surrender monday morning before a press pool 
television videotape camera the transfer was not shown on live 
television but was shown later on news broadcasts 
during the threeday siege the rioters displayed machetelike 
knives with blades about 12 inches long and three bedsheetbanners 
were unfurled from the roof of the twostory dormitory where the 
hostages were held 
the first sheet said white power a second one said doc 
will not respond to demands they have lied to you the public and 
press the third requested help from the media 
i feel like the inmates did that for attention ms trammell 
said of the white power banner also i feel like we have 
some racists up there she added 
state rep gary coffee one of three state legislators involved 
in the negotiations said the riot started after white inmates 
accused blacks of stealing from them but state rep kenneth 
converse another negotiator downplayed the racial angle 
one or two individuals can make it look like a racist deal 
converse said its not a racist deal and its not an 
overcrowding issue 
maynard said he believes the riot was spontaneous and was not 
primarily racial although he acknowledged that the original fight 
was among blacks and whites 
it apparently was a fight over a property issue between blacks 
and whites it escalated when our officers tried to arrest the 
inmates it doesnt seem like it was racially motivated

14 others should be executed june 27 a judge said monday after 
granting r gene simmons wish to waive his right to appeal his 
death sentence 
simmons 47 was convicted last week of two deaths in a dec 28 
shooting rampage in russellville he is due to stand trial july 18 
for the deaths of 14 members of his family whose bodies were 
discovered by police at his home 
if no one intervenes to delay the execution it would be one of 
the swiftest in modern us history but a woman whose daughter and 
grandson were killed says she wants simmons tried again before 
hes put to sleep 
no one has been executed in arkansas since 1964 
john burnett a little rock attorney who chairs an eightmember 
committee that considers cases for intervention by the arkansas 
chapter of the american civil liberties union said no decision had 
been made about the simmons case 
he said possible intervention would probably be discussed by the 
committee 
charlotte croston the mother of renata simmons and her son 
trae who were among those found at the simmons home said with 
tears streaming from her eyes she wanted simmons to stand trial for 
killing his relatives 
id like for him to suffer a little bit before hes put to 
sleep she said i dont know if he believes in the hereafter 
but the last laugh is on him because hes going to suffer a lot 
more then i want him to die i just want him to face justice in 
this life before he does 
immediately after being convicted thursday of killing kathy 
kendrick and james chaffin and trying to kill five other people 
simmons asked his trial judge circuit court judge john patterson 
to expedite his execution 
after he was sentenced simmons calmly read a brief statement 
in which he said that anything short of death would be cruel and 
unusual punishment 
i only ask for what i deserve he said let the torture 
and suffering in me end please allow me the right to be at peace 
patterson said he scheduled mondays hearing to satisfy himself 
that simmons was mentally competent to waive his right to appeal 
patterson reminded simmons during mondays 35minute hearing 
that any time prior to execution you have the right to change 
your mind and appeal do you understand that 
simmons said he understood and did not think he would change his 
mind adding nobody better hold their breath 
simmons said the decision actually was made on the 28th of 
december the day he went on a shooting rampage that killed two 
and wounded four in russellville

promoting dialogue and a greater participation of everyone in 
public affairs 
stroessner has been widely criticized for barring a genuine 
political opposition in this nation of 38 million 
the pope who spoke spanish also said respect for human 
rights as is well known is not a question of political 
convenience but stems from the dignity of the person by virtue of 
his condition as a creature of god 
stroessner in turn delivered an impassioned defense of his 
lawandorder government and stressed paraguays catholic 
traditions 
this country opens its heart to the supreme pastor with the 
vast panorama of its auspicious present this paraguay of today

on monday morning bahlinger told the associated press that 
paraguayan peasants were repressed by the government you can 
taste the fear in the countryside its diabolical its evil he 
said 
bahlinger said the fast was designed to call attention to the 
peasants appeals for land reform and better working and living 
conditions 
bahlinger a jesuit said he had worked in paraguay for eight 
years and was based at san ignacio 125 miles south of asuncion 
several peasant activists remained in the church the police 
have us surrounded and theyre ambushing people as they walk

a spokesman for the nations tobacco 
farmers blasted the us surgeon general on monday and said his 
report comparing nicotine to addictive drugs like heroin and 
cocaine was nonsense 
i think it is just another salvo in the political war against 
tobacco and doesnt have a thing to do with science said reggie 
lester managing director of the tobacco growers information 
committee inc its politics as usual from the antitobacco 
crowd 
lester called surgeon general c everett koop a political 
animal called his report patent nonsense and said hes 
crossed the line of common sense 
lesters organization is a coalition of 44 growers groups based 
in north carolina which produces about twothirds of the nations 
tobacco 
rj reynolds tobacco co in winstonsalem north carolinas 
largest maker of cigarettes would not comment on the report and 
referred all calls to the tobacco institute in washington 
state agriculture commissioner jim graham was out of town and 
unavailable for comment 
koops report organized previously disclosed research into a 
presentation lumping nicotine with heroin and cocaine as 
physiologically addictive substances 
careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettes 
and other forms of tobacco are addicting koop wrote in a 
preface an extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is 
the drug in tobacco that causes addiction 
sen terry sandord dnc said that koops comparison of 
tobacco a legitimate and legal substance to insidious narcotics 
is a direction of friendly fire at american farmers and 
businessmen 
perhaps i shouldnt be surprised sanford said this is 
the administration that declares war on drugs and then counsels 
people to just say no 
i concur with recent statements that we have never heard of a 
smoker robbing a convenience store a gas station or a little old 
lady to obtain money to purchase cigarettes said wb jenkins 
north carolina farm bureau president there have been numerous 
news reports of such robberies to obtain monies to satisfy 
addiction to marijuana heroin or cocaine 
lester said the tobacco industry wont suffer from being 
mentioned with drugs such as heroin and cocaine because im not 
sure that you can create a more difficult social stigma for tobacco 
than already exits 
lester also said it was erroneous for koop to conclude that 
children are buying cigarettes from vending machines 
almost all of the vending machines that are out there are 
supervised by adults lester said they go for upscale 
restaurants and bars they take surveys and find out that the 
number of young people that buy cigarettes from vending machines is 
less than 5 percent 
we do not want young people as customers lester added we 
think smoking is an adult custom if they the government want to 
take some measures for making it harder young people to buy 
cigarettes we wouldnt have any problems with that

the general secretary of the 
opposition christian democratic party ivan romero returned to 
panama on monday 10 days after he was expelled from the country 
his return came on the same day that commerce minister mario 
rognoni called lunacy the us demand that gen manuel antonio 
noriega resign rognoni told a news conference here just as the 
united states does not negotiate over hostages neither do we 
romero had come back on may 6 from an international conference 
of christian democratic leaders in miami but was detained upon 
arrival by police and held overnight 
party president ricardo arias calderon said romero was beaten 
during an interrogation before being put on a plane back to miami 
the following day 
on monday romero told about 40 supporters who showed up to 
greet him this kind of action makes us tougher for the fight we 
will keep up until the end 
the christian democrats oppose noriega who as head of the 
15000member defense forces is also de facto leader in panama 
noriega has been under us indictment in florida since february on 
drug trafficking and money laundering charges 
the reagan administration has been pressuring the general to 
relinquish power applying economic sanctions and freezing 
panamanian bank accounts in the united states 
rognoni called us pressure a new form of state terrorism 
and said today the world has changed and it is a brand new world 
for panama 
he outlined an economic recovery plan designed to definitively 
and drastically reduce panamanian dependence on the united states 
including the pursuit of new markets and sources of investment 
outside north america which has always been panamas major 
economic partner 
what has happened because of the economic aggression has come 
to help the panamanian people because it has taught them they 
cannot trust or depend on the united states as a true friend the 
commerce minister said 
he said secret talks here in recent weeks between state 
department envoy michael kozak and noriegas representatives are 
positive because we did not call them we did not ask them to 
come they came on their own which means they must be 
reevaulating and rethinking their policies toward panama 
he said the discussions did not amount to negotiations because 
the us can drop the indictments and lift the sanctions 
unilaterally without having to negotiate with anyone 
asked if kozak and noriegas people were talking about noriegas 
abandoning his post rognoni replied the united states makes a 
mistake when it thinks that because of its power because of its 
arrogance or capacity to exert force it can tell a country who 
should be its president or who should be its chief of firemen or 
police 
to ask that a commander retire or whats more that he leave 
the country as if he were on some kind of parole is lunacy 
rognoni said the talks between kozak and noriegas 
representatives included three main areas political implications 
of the crisis economic effects of us sanctions and the affairs 
of noriega with the us department of justice 
rognoni said a full review of uspanamanian relations was 
needed 
i doubt very much that the us thinks that after all they 
have done all they have to do is send a secret envoy and everyone 
will kiss and make up he said 
we need to negotiate whether we feel comfortable with the 
threat from the us that at any moment they can block our accounts 
and close our banking center and destroy our economy depending on 
the whims of whoever is in office in the us 
and we have to rethink and retalk with them if we are going to 
allow them to use their military bases in panama for whatever 
purpose in central america without our knowledge and approval he 
added 
the united states maintains about 10000 soldiers along the 
panama canal according to the 1977 panama canal treaty complete 
control of the waterway and the bases is to be handed over to 
panama on dec 31 1999

galveston texas its graduation day tuesday for some 1100 
kemps ridley sea turtles the most endangered sea turtle 
marine biologists hope the turtles released into the gulf of 
mexico after being raised in captivity will someday return to the 
gulfs beaches to nest survival of the species is the goal 
tuesdays freedom for members of the species known as 
lepidochelys kempi is the 10th annual turtle release and experts 
still are waiting to see if the experiment to bolster the animals 
population is a success 
none of the 12422 turtles raised and released by the national 
marine fisheries service in galveston since the socalled head 
start program began in 1977 has returned to the western gulf of 
mexico beaches to nest 
you have to be patient to be a sea turtle scientist charles 
w caillouet chief of the life studies division at the services 
galveston laboratory said monday 
this latest senior class spent its entire lifetime 
circumnavigating small circular tubs one turtle to each container 
stored in climatecontrolled greenhouses 
early tuesday three truckloads of cardboard boxes carrying the 
1and 2yearold turtles head to port aransas about 200 miles away 
where they will be loaded on a boat and taken several miles into 
the gulf off padre island 
when that last turtle hits the water its like a lead weight 
has been lifted off our backs said tim fontaine a research 
fishery biologist weve done our job 
fontaine has overseen the growth of the turtles since they were 
3 to 5 days old about the size of silver dollars and weighing less 
than an ounce 
today the yearold turtles weigh about 2 pounds each and for 
the first time this year 98 2yearold turtles weighing about 25 
pounds each will be released 
biologists hope the more mature animals will stand a better 
chance of surviving 
scientists are looking for the answer to attract the turtle back 
to the western gulf of mexico beaches its only known nesting area 
turtle eggs were taken a year ago to the north padre island 
beach and the hatchlings scurried across the beach into the water 
before they were captured and moved to galveston 
its hoped when they reach sexual maturity the turtles will 
return instinctively to the beach 
thats the critical objective caillouet said its 
documented very clearly our turtles survive for a long time and mix 
themselves in with the natural stocks 
galvestongrown turtles marked with metal tags or special skin 
grafts or electronic and magnetic devices have been found as far 
away as morocco france and newfoundland 
the mystery however is what triggers the animals nesting and 
a return to the gulf we dont know how long it takes for them to 
mature in the wild caillouet said we would guess we are 
looking for 8 to 10 years for early maturity in the wild but we 
really dont know 
in the late 1940s as many as 40000 turtles nested in a single 
day near rancho nuevo mexico about 200 miles south of 
brownsville texas 
today less than 600 turtles nest in the entire season from 
april through july or august caillouet said there may be as many 
as 100 eggs incubating over 60 days in each nest upon hatching 
the tiny turtles flee into the gulf 
the decline in population came as the beaches and turtles and 
eggs were exploited from the 1940s until the 1960s 
that problem has been resolved but we yet dont see any of 
the increase in the number of nesters caillouet said so 
somethings happening to the turtle at sea 
once they reach adult growth the turtles only known natural 
predator is shark they are the bulldogs of the sea says 
fontaine they are a highly agressive animal

the driver of a pickup truck that 
collided with a church bus in a fiery weekend crash was charged 
with 27 counts of murder monday after blood tests showed he was 
legally drunk at the time 
larry mahoney 34 of worthville was served with warrants at 
humana hospitaluniversity of louisville where he is in serious 
condition officials said a guard has been posted at his door 
police said 
carroll county commonwealths attorney john ackman said he will 
not hesitate to seek the death penalty in the saturday night crash 
on interstate 71 that killed 27 people returning from a church 
outing at an amusement park 
investigators from the national transportation safety board said 
at a news conference that the converted school bus did not meet 
post1977 safety requirements for a caged fuel tank 
joseph t nall an ntsb board member said the buss fuel tank 
had a 3inch gash in it and had been pushed back 26 inches by the 
impact of the crash 
when asked if a caged tank might have prevented the fire that 
enveloped the bus after the accident nall said thats the 
ultimate question wed like to answer but now it would be 
premature 
tests on mahoney found a 24 blood alcohol level said capt 
neal brittain of the lagrange state police post under state law a 
blood alcohol level of 10 creates the legal presumption of 
intoxication 
district judge stanley billingsley denied bond mahoney will be 
arraigned once he is released from the hospital according to the 
district court order 
the case will go to the grand jury on june 6 ackman said 
federal safety officials began an inquiry monday into the 
collision nall said investigators attempted to interview mahoney 
on monday but he would not talk to investigators for reasons of 
his own 
nall also said that the 1977 superior bus with a ford chassis 
which the manufacturer said was equipped to carry 66 passengers and 
a driver the number aboard the night of the crash did not 
appear to be overloaded 
some survivors have said the seats that were supposed to hold 
three people were too small resulting in some people hanging in 
the aisle 
it is not something we have corroborated to our 
satisfaction said ntsb spokesman alan pollock 
pollock said investigators on monday examined the accident site 
about 45 miles northeast of louisville where mahoneys northbound 
toyota pickup truck slammed headon into the first assembly of god 
bus in the southbound lanes 
in addition to checking the emergency exit investigtors would 
check the rescue process maintenance records of the bus and their 
drivers records said alan pollock a spokesman with the national 
transportation safety board 
we also want to talk to some of the survivors and witnesses to 
the accident pollock said and investigators hope to get some 
kind of profile on the pickup truck and what it might have been 
doing that night 
authorities said it still isnt known why the truck was 
traveling the wrong way 
state officials said they hope to have positive identification 
of all the bodies by tuesday 
the state medical examiner dr george nichols said at a news 
conference monday that all of the victims died from smoke 
inhalation there was no significant bodily injury he said 
the kentucky post reported monday that mahoney pleaded guilty in 
1984 to drunken driving and was fined 300 plus court costs and 
140 for traffic school his license also was suspended for six 
months the newspaper said 
his bloodalcohol level in the 1984 case was 16 percent the 
newspaper said 
a friend of mahoneys dennis mefford said he was with mahoney 
until about 2 hours before the accident occurred he said mahoney 
was very tired from having worked a double shift at mampt chemical 
co in carrollton 
i cant remember seeing him drive in that bad a shape 
mefford said its really tore everybody up around here that 
something his tragic could happen its unbelievable simple 
unbelievable 
pollock also said the driving records of mahoney and the bus 
driver john pearman would be reviewed 
state police trooper jim mudd said state police investigators 
talked briefly with mahoney but did not disclose the conversation 
because the case is still under investigation 
dental charts of the victims were sent to the university of 
louisville on monday for matching with dental records said david 
jones of the state medical examiners office

americans overwhelmingly favor the ussoviet

seventythree percent of those polled in the national survey 
supported the accord to eliminate mediumrange missiles and as 
many said they would back a treaty to cut each nations longrange 
arsenal in half 
but 61 percent said the soviets cant be trusted to live up to 
their arms control agreements that reflected sentiment in the 
senate which last week demanded clarification of the anticheating

us experts on the soviet union expect little 
from the moscow summit and are looking beyond it to an early summer 
communist party conference which by all accounts will be a 
watershed in soviet politics 
mikhail s gorbachev appears likely to survive for at least a 
couple more years as the partys general secretary but he has 
failed to gain full control of the policymaking central committee 
the 300plus member body that so far has stymied his farreaching 
reform efforts according to the experts 
they view the summit primarily as part of gorbachevs effort to 
cement his control 
gorbachevs reforms so far have not improved soviet living 
standards according to western dispatches from moscow and a recent 
analysis by the central intelligence agency

prime minister rajiv gandhis government 
sees a shift in the strategic balance in this part of asia and is 
worried that india is losing its traditional edge 
the fears have prompted the government to increase defense 
spending to a record 10 billion this year and to reopen debate on 
the development of nuclear weapons 
we cant just keep escalating expenditures to meet the 
challenge said air commodore jasjit singh director of the 
governmentfunded institute for defense studies and analyses in new 
delhi i dont want to see a nuclear india but the most 
costeffective solution is to go nuclear 
india tested a nuclear device in 1974 but insisted it was for 
peaceful purposes 
the concerns about shifts in the strategic balance have been 
reflected in recent headlines in indian newspapers 
sinopakistansaudi ties threat to india 
the afghan accord dangerous implications 
pakistan arms hurt peace process 
india traditionally has kept a wary eye on pakistan its 
neighbor on the subcontinent 
the two countries have fought three wars since their 
independence from britain in 1947 and their troops still clash 
intermittently along the disputed border in indias northern 
kashmir state india also has clashed with china over disputed 
borders 
but pakistan is the chief concern because of repeated reports it 
is close to developing a nuclear weapon and because of us plans 
to give the pakistanis 17 billion in military aid over the next 
six years 
indian officials and the press also speculate that with the 
soviet military withdrawal from afghanistan pakistan now will be 
able to turn more attention toward india 
at the same time the indians worry about weapons shifts in 
china to the north and saudi arabia to the west 
china has been moving nuclear missiles into tibet according to 
western press reports and indian military experts it also has been 
beefing up its army garrisons to tighten control over the former 
buddhist kingdom 
singh the analyst said he does not believe the chinese moves 
are aimed directly at india but added that in the long run they 
constitute a larger level of threat against south asia 
to the west saudi arabia has taken delivery of an undisclosed 
number of chinesemade east wind surfacetosurface missiles with a 
range of almost 2000 miles making them capable of reaching india 
the saudi missiles are seen as a deterrent to iran in the 
persian gulf but narendra gupta an indian weapons expert wrote 
in a recent article in the independent times of india newspaper 
the same missile system would on the one hand deter iran for 
saudi arabia and on the other it would be a threat to india on 
behalf of pakistan 
one fallout of end of hostilities in afghanistan said the 
leftleaning weekly democratic world of new delhi is that arms no 
longer needed by the afghan rebels could find their way to both 
pakistani and indian insurgents such as the sikhs extremists in 
punjab 
the other fallout could be that pakistan relieved of its 
anxiety on its western borders could move its contingents to its 
eastern borders next to india the magazine said 
india has a larger military force than pakistan an army with 
11 million personnel compared to 450000 in pakistan for example 
but it has china on one side and pakistan on the other and its 
forces must be used to guard against both

a 15year campaign to promote 
filipino as the national language has stirred controversy in the 
philippines where more than 80 languages and dialects are spoken 
in 1973 when he was president ferdinand e marcos mandated a 
policy of using english and filipino a malay language based on the 
tagalog dialect in elementary and high schools 
english had been used exclusively in schools since the united 
states took control of the philippines from spain in 1899 and is 
still widely spoken by the educated elite 
the new constitution drafted after president corazon aquino 
took office from marcos reinforced the commitment to promote 
filipino while retaining english as a second official language 
spanish was dropped as an official language 
last year the education department declared that english would 
no longer be an exclusive language for teaching science and 
technology in elementary and high schools and that filipino should 
be developed as a linguistic symbol of national unity and 
identity 
as part of the drive government television switched its main 
evening newscast from english to filipino four of the five private 
television stations have expanded the use of filipino in newscasts 
ponciano pineda director of the institute for philippine 
languages said the bilingual campaign is designed to make 
filipino the language of intellectual pursuit 
but the campaign has run into stumbling blocks because of the 
nature and background of the language 
in the 1930s president manuel quezon decreed that the 
manilaarea dialect tagalog would become the basis of a national 
language 
but tagalog is used as the principal language by only about 30 
percent of the countrys 58 million people speakers of various 
visayan dialects used in the central islands and mindanao form a 
slight majority 
to make the decision more palatable to other linguistic groups 
the language was called pilipino and later filipino some 
words and grammatical constructions from other native languages 
were added 
that has led to a debate among language scholars over spellings 
as well as the extent to which foreign words notably english 
should be considered acceptable 
a group of professors tried to promote phonetic spellings such 
as sabjek for the english subject and nawn for noun 
in an effort to mirror filipino pronunciation 
pineda of the languages institute says borrowing of words can be 
acceptable if they have been filipinized such as kudeta 
for coup detat 
but the widespread use of loan words has produced what 
critics call taglish a mix english and tagalog 
educated filipinos especially in manila frequently switch from 
english to filipino in conversations beginning a sentence in one 
language and ending it in the other 
words such as magbeysbol or to play baseball have 
crept into the language the residue of 350 years of spanish 
colonialism lives on in such words as mesa for table and 
tindahan from the spanish tienda meaning shop 
professor jesus ramos a filipinolanguage teacher at the 
university of the philippines defends the use of english words 
because it mirrors the use of the national language by all 
filipinos 
most of the nearly 30 newspapers in manila are published in 
english as are numerous legal documents magazines and books 
mrs aquino who was educated in the united states uses english 
for most of her major speeches debates in congress are normally 
conducted in english 
critics complain that the bilingual policy has resulted in a 
deterioration of english skills they believe the country should be 
promoting english because it affords greater opportunity for study 
and work here and abroad 
but pineda said the purpose for which we started teaching 
english in the 1900s no longer holds we used to think that only 
through the window of english could we look at the picture of life 
but we have discovered that this is not true 
professor ramos predicts that filipino eventually will supplant 
english and that the need for english loan words will fade 
if english will weaken here borrowing of english words will 
also lessen he said

if youre wanted watch out nbcs unsolved 
mysteries or fox broadcastings americas most wanted may 
send the police to your doorstep 
jerry strickland was arrested in connection with a 1987 michigan 
murder when 20 people recognized him after seeing unsolved 
mysteries last february 
strickland was watching when he was arrested he told police it 
was his favorite show 
one fugitive james charles stark was found on the basis of a 
promo for an upcoming episode of americas most wanted stark 
convicted three times as a sex offender was wanted in the murder 
of a girl in banning calif and for the rape of a woman in nearby 
hemet 
americas most wanted was the highestrated show on the fox 
network in the most recent rating period 
fox contends that 13 dangerous criminals are behind bars today 
as a result of profiles in the first 12 weeks of americas most 
wanted 
robert stack host of unsolved mysteries said four cases 
have been resolved as a result of that show 
this is a public service said stack it works television 
is such a saturation medium its like marshall mcluhans global 
village people blame television for passive viewing this is 
active viewing with twoway communications you can help solve a 
mystery 
both shows feature reenactments of the crimes often with some 
of the real people who were involved 
this program demonstrates that people dont have to resort to 
vigilantism to help catch criminals said john walsh host of the 
fox show walsh has become a national spokesman for victims since 
his son adam was abducted and killed seven years ago the tv 
movies adam and adam his song continues told his story 
i think these shows are also popular because people are fed up 
with the level of violence in this country said walsh 
washington is now the murder capital of the united states can 
you imagine the nations capital and its ahead of miami detroit 
and new york in murders 
walsh whose diligence got congress to pass legislation to aid 
in the location of missing children and set up a center in 
washington said i think people realize this is a great country 
and we have great resources and theres no reason for violence 
people are sick of it 
the basic difference between the shows is that americas most 
wanted deals only with fugitive criminals unsolved mysteries 
gets into all types of unsolved events and missing persons 
americas most wanted is a weekly show on the fox network 
unsolved mysteries appears as an occasional special on nbc the 
next scheduled for wednesday may 25 
many of our stories deal with normal people in abnormal 
situations said stack best known for his role as eliot ness on 
the untouchables television series a generation ago 
i dont have much sympathy for hoodlums he said i would 
never allow a hoodlum to be sympathetic on the untouchables they 
recently made a movie about frank nitti and made him to be a normal 
person these were psychotic killers

in the life the organization previously helped rescue cbs 
cagney amp lacey and st elsewhere vqt director dorothy 
swanson said in a letter to tartikoff that canceling the show would 
be tantamount to a form of book burning because year is like a 
good novel we read a chapter each week and we arent finished 
with this novel yet

editors note every kid with a cane pole and a can of worms 
knows the joy of fishing one of four americans fish for fun among 
them the selfanointed elite are the 64 million fly fishermen to 
them hooking a trout can be like a religious experience and their 
numbers are growing along with their passion this is the first of 
three articles

as johnny france remembers it he was a boy 
roaming wild in the bear trap canyon when he first saw her 
she was standing up on her hind legs staring straight down 
into the river as it swirled around her every once in a while her 
big paw would shoot out splashing her but she kept coming up 
emptyhanded either missing completely or the slippery trout 
would wiggle out of her grasp after a very long time completely 
frustrated and still hungry that old sow grizzly let out an angry 
growl shook herself off and walked away in disgust 
france likes to tell that tall tale to the fly fishermen he 
guides down the madison river of montana it is his homegrown 
homily about the humblings of nature on man and beast his tactful 
way of saying fly fishing is the great leveler it is merciless 
toward ceos yuppies onehorse cowpokes and grizzly bears alike 
france especially likes to spin his yarn on days when the fish 
arent biting 
2994 trout per mile exclaims the state of montana in 
halfpage advertisements in fishing magazines adding its own 
codicil for doubting thomases honestaverage from five 
selected montana rivers 
the ad implies that fishing is so easy in montana even a child 
can do it but a fly fisherman puts away childish things like 
night crawlers and grasshoppers 
boys should learn about trout after they have learned about 
girls wrote geoffrey norman in a fishermans seasons 
trout and trout rivers are sensuous and unpredictable they 
frustrate more than they reward and they have a way of making you 
feel inadequate 
so to be a fly fisherman is to surrender to the complexities of 
30000 fly patterns the more than 130 different fly rods sold by 
the orvis company alone and all the nuance and subtlety of the 
sport it is sometimes to be skunked to go home with an empty 
creel and dreams of the one that got away 
whenever we touched the banks of the yellowstone river great 
numbers of trout were seen of enormous size swimming in water 
which was so clear that every motion of the fish could be 
distinctly seenselecting my lightest fly rod my reel and line 
were soon attachedthe trout were there i knew and i expected 
to hook one the instant the flies struck but i was doomed to 
disappointment there was no responsei tried every color in my 
book but to no purposei spent an hour without a single rise 
and at length gave it up 
thus wrote gen william strong in 1875 during a military 
expedition through the yellowstone country of montana and wyoming 
american indians fished for food long before plymouth rock but 
fly fishing was imported by british and european immigrants 
theres evidence it was practiced for sport on eastern rivers as 
far back as the revolutionary war 
in much of the old country most good fishing streams are 
privately owned with no public access democracy gave all citizens 
the right to fish the united states public waters that equality 
explains why one in four are now fishermen anybody with a pole a 
line and a hook and who buys a license can fish on 729 million 
acres of federal state and municipal public lands 
but on some days when the wind isnt just right or the light 
is wrong or the great fish god simply decrees no not in this 
space and time there will be no taut lines stopped hearts or 
sparkling rainbows flashing through the air 
the true mystery of fly fishing is why any trout salmon 
steelhead a seagoing rainbow trout bass or bonefish is ever 
caught by a man or woman dressed up in rubber britches 
it kinda makes you wonder why a fish would pick you mused 
france a 47yearold cowboy and former sheriff whos fished his 
whole life 
why with all the billions of bugs flying around and under the 
water would a big brown trout decide to eat mine 
because france knows how to read water how to match live 
mosquitoes with the dead feathers and hair he ties on his hook how 
to predict the time and distance in a fishs life 
to know what he knows is a quest which sets millions of men and 
more and more women off in search of perfect equipment perfect 
rivers the anglers equivalent of biblical tomes and companions 
with whom to share the passion and wonder which envelops an angler 
the instant he hooks his first fish on an artificial fly 
it was an employment for his idle time which was then not 
idly spent wrote fly fishings first guru izaac walton in 
the compleat angler 
a rest to his mind a cheerer of his spirits a diverter of 
sadness a calmer of unquiet thoughts a moderator of passions a 
procurrer of contentednessand that it begat habits of peace and 
patience in those that professed and practiced it 
three centuries later norman maclean published a slim volume 
containing a novella and two short stories titled a river runs 
through it which has become another classic of the genre 
in our family there was no clear line between religion and 
fly fishing maclean wrote we lived at the junction of great 
trout rivers in western montana and our father was a presbyterian 
minister and a fly fisherman who tied his own flies and taught 
others he told us about christs disciples being fishermen and we 
were left to assume as my brother and i did that all firstclass 
fishermen on the sea of galilee were fly fishermen and that john 
the favorite was a dryfly fisherman

dry flies being in the lexicon of the sport the equivalent of 
the shootout at the ok corral because they are little fake bugs 
which float on top of the water and dare a fish to show itself when 
it comes after them 
wet flies which are made of more absorbent materials sink 
below the surface and therefore arent considered as much fun by 
purists 
and purists there are by the hundreds of thousands unlike 
plunk and dunkers who use live bait or shiny lures to spincast for 
catfish bluegills yellow perch and black crappie fly fishermen 
are elitists 
it isnt money that sets them apart from other fishermen 
although kings and presidents have commonly been fly fishermen 
never mind that today a serious or just plain rich angler can 
spend thousands on equipment and costume 
no say fly fishermen theirs is an intellectual exercise as 
much as a physical workout it is a sport where no one keeps score 
an avocation demanding as much concentration as a hostile takeover 
or a friendly merger 
calling fishing a hobby is like calling brain surgery a job 
said paul schullery author of the new book american fly fishing 
a history 
the curious may collect hundreds of volumes on the subject 
dating from a treatise on fishing with a hook attributed to 
dame juliana berneres in 1496 to tom rosenbauers reading trout 
streams which is still in print 
some of americas noted writers ernest hemingway zane grey 
and artists winslow homer n c wyeth labored to transmit to the 
unenlightened the joy and frustrations of fly fishing 
research can sometimes carry zealots to the outside of the 
envelope professional angler a j mcclane has wet a line in 141 
countries and lived with eskimos and pygmies to learn techniques 
author and publisher nick lyons wearing goggles once submerged 
himself in a full bathtub to get a troutseye view he said he 
didnt learn much 
the more the mystery deepens the more the magic beckons 
some fly fishermen especially after a great day on a fine 
river guess that the attraction is linked to mans primeval 
origins they wax poetic about the thrill of the hunt the 
oneonone battle with a wild creature sometimes they compare the 
experience to love 
ive guided on the new fork river of wyoming for 25 years 
but ive never landed a trophy on her lamented jack dennis jr 
of jackson wy theres a certain mystery to that river like 
wondering whatever happened to the girl you loved in high school 
but didnt marry 
increasingly fly fishermen say the thrill of catching a trout 
or a steelhead is nearly matched by releasing it to hook again some 
other day on the sections of rivers designated gold medal and blue 
ribbon by various agencies barbless hooks and catchandrelease 
regulations are the norm rather than the exception 
because coldwater game fish need clear clean water to survive 
they can often be seen gliding just below the surface every year 
nearly 180000 visitors to yellowstone national park peer over the 
edge of fishing bridge where angling is outlawed to watch the 
fish go by just watch 
the roman poet martial a d 40104 may have been the first to 
use a feathered hook to land a saltwater fish a hundred years 
later macedonian fishermen reportedly were catching trout on fake 
flies 
through the ages fishermen landed countless catches using all 
kinds of artificial creations fly tying itself became an art 
in 1658 richard franck who served in oliver cromwells army 
noted that the salmon delights in the most gaudy and orient 
colors you can choose 
mary ellen orvis marbury whose father charles orvis founded 
the nations oldest mailorder company in 1856 was the first 
person to organize and categorize fly patterns used in the united 
states she exhibited her own handtied flies at the columbian 
world exposition in chicago in 1893 
todays artificial flies imitate anything from a tiny egg to 
snails hundreds are on display at the american museum of fly 
fishing in manchester vt which houses the history of the sport 
in the new world 
men women and children who wade into a trout stream do it for 
their own reasons but all are bound by unifying skeins there is 
peace in such places the outer peace of scenery the inner peace 
of reflection 
for a fly fisherman standing kneedeep in a swiftly flowing 
stream of melted snow or a crystalline lake there is harmony with 
earth and sky a condition increasingly rare in this hightech 
highdensity world 
never mind if its raining never mind if the wind blows glory 
be if its bracing blue skies if the trees on the bank are tender 
green or autumnal gold if the breeze is a caress 
never mind if the trout arent biting or the salmon arent 
running they did yesterday they will tomorrow if theres one 
commandment all fly fishermen believe in it is the optimism of 
tomorrow 
for that is the day they will finally land all the ones that got 
away

more and more often the peace and 
tranquility of worldclass trout streams near here are being 
invaded by the distant shriek and explosion of military training 
its a collision of two worlds both economically vital to the 
2000 residents of this northern lower peninsula town surrounded by 
woods and winding rivers 
northeast of town is camp grayling the nations secondlargest 
national guard training post there men and women from across the 
country train for battle 
also to the northeast are branches of the au sable river 
classified by outdoors magazines as being among the top fly fishing 
streams in the nation there men and women seek the serenity of a 
shallow river twisting through wooded hills a favorite habitat of 
the trout 
for nearly 75 years the two sides have coexisted in relative 
harmony but recently as the post expands its mission to include 
some wintertime training and resort development expands its 
holdings they have butted into each other 
within five miles of some small communities made up partly of 
summertime cabins along the au sable and manistee rivers are 
ranges the guard periodically bombards with artillery and 
airtoground shells 
the guard mostly uses marker bombs with a small explosive 
charge and plenty of dye to show where a bomb hit sometimes the 
real thing bombs containing up to 500 pounds of explosives are 
used 
the guard activity the night firing and everything else that 
goes on totally destroys the ambiance of the fly fishermen on the 
river says dan alstott president of the ausable manistee action 
council a coalition of conservationists and other groups 
the branches of the au sable which means to the sands in 
french wind their way east to lake huron 
rusty gates president of the anglers of the au sable runs the 
16room gates fishing lodge on the river where the trout season 
runs from late april through october fish may be caught and 
released anytime during the year however 
weve had flames 150 feet high right across the river after 
guard bombs started fires gates says adding that he has briefly 
evacuated his business three times because of the fires 
theyll be shooting airtoground incendiary rockets and 
everybody else cant burn trash he says 
alstotts group has filed a lawsuit challenging the scope of 
training at the camp and seeking to enforce the original agreement 
in 1913 under which only the michigan militia could train at the 
camp 
one problem is lowflight corridors established years ago 
before multiengined jets which are a lot nosier we get 
complaints about wrecking peace and quiet says lt col brian 
downey spokesman for the michigan guard 
occasionally residents near the ranges report cracked windows 
and fallen plaster after an exercise if an investigation 
establishes the damage was caused by the training the guard pays 
for the repairs 
one of the bombing ranges is near guthrie lake on the northwest 
border of the camp this spring otsego lake township assessor 
lorrie chapman cut the value of houses off the lake itself by 50 
percent 
more than likely she said its because of the bombing at 
the bombing range 
to keep the noise down and to streamline training downey said a 
new computerized mock war zone will be built farther inside the 
camps boundaries 
downey said as part of the armys total force concept the 
multipurpose range complex combines tank infantry and helicopter 
training with computerized targets the range will be nestled 
between two rises in the land which should cut noise he added 
gates group strongly opposes the complex saying it lies in the 
au sable watershed area and in addition to noise may result in 
pollution of the river because of the explosives 
in grayling itself many in the business community welcome the 
guard at this summers peak about 8000 troops will train at the 
camp 
its an advantage says mary holden manager of a small 
downtown hotel theyve kept us in business for years

when jimmy carter as president needed to get away for a while 
before he went to camp david with israeli prime minister menachem 
begin and egyptian president anwar sadat his thoughts turned to 
fly fishing 
when i was president rosalynn and i fly fished out west he 
says on the precamp david trip i took along with me the 
briefing books that i would be using to prepare myself for the 
mideast negotiations so it was a combination of delightful 
surroundings good companionsand also just clearing my mind when 
i was ready to embark on one of the major challenges of my 
presidency 
he now fly fishes throughout the world but loves to come home 
to north georgia to the little log cabin he furnished with his 
handmade wooden furniture 
the cabin is within 20 feet of turnip town creek which has a 
fairly good native population of rainbow trout its the perfect 
environment for writing in placid beautiful surroundings in 
almost total isolation when rosalynn and i are there which is 
never enough it makes for good thoughts and productive days 
the former president has written a new book an outdoor 
journal reflections and adventures recalling favorite fishing 
experiences writing it he said was a labor of love 
jack hemingway i bet i was the only american in world war ii 
who parachuted into occupied france with a fly rod i used it 
too 
the son of legendary fisherman and writer ernest hemingway now 
lives in ketchum idaho between angling excursions to distant 
parts of the globe but some of his most vivid memories are of his 
happy days on clear rivers with his father 
when i was 6 before id ever picked up a fly rod i spent one 
whole summer watching him fish the clarks fork river of the 
yellowstone hemingway says finally at the very end when id 
spent the whole summer building up the need to fish my father 
taught me how to cast 
author of misadventures of a fly fisherman jack hemingway 
says his love for the sport has lasted throughout his life not so 
for his late father 
dad had a big nice trunk outfitted with all his rods and 
reels and tackle everything he had collected over his years of fly 
fishing remembers hemingway right after that wonderful summer 
on the clarks fork in the fall of 1939 he had the trunk shipped 
by railway express and they lost it he never trout fished again 
i think it was as if he felt hed have to start all over again and 
it just wasnt worth the trouble 
paul volcker i took my wife fishing on our honeymoon and she 
hasnt been since says the former chairman of the federal 
reserve board 
volcker now teaches at princeton university and is chairman of a 
new york investment banking firm when he resigned from the fed 
last year he said he planned to go fishing 
i went maybe eight times last summer i ought to be doing 
more says volcker whos cast for trout in scotland england 
and yugoslavia youre out with nature and all that stuff its 
nice to be more or less alone testing your wits and skill but im 
a real amateur 
in the winter he ties his own flies at his manhattan home and 
plots a warm weather assault on distant rivers perhaps in new 
zealand or montana from now on im going to grab fishing 
whenever i can get it 
linda morgens on the first date with my future husband my 
train into new york was late so he occupied his time by going to 
abercrombie amp fitch and buying some artificial flies he was very 
surprised when he showed them to me and i started identifying them 
our mutual enthusiasm for fly fishing was certainly a plus 
mrs morgens is a veteran member of trout unlimiteds board of 
directors and chairs the nominating committee 
both my parents were fishermen my mother once held a blue 
marlin record and since i was an only child i spent a lot of time 
doing male sort of things with them i grew up before the womens 
lib thing so fishing taught me how to do things on my own taught 
me i could go off alone without needing any help in those days 
there werent that many things which could teach women to be 
independent but fly fishing was one of them 
mrs morgens and her husband ned live in south norwalk conn 
curt gowdy who for 20 years hosted the american sportsman on 
abc when wed go fishing my dad would say curtis remember 
the buffalo there were millions of them before the white man wiped 
them out for money that could happen to trout too so from the 
very beginning when i learned to fly fish at the age of 8 i was 
always a catchandrelease fisherman 
he fishes almost everywhere now and wherever he goes he 
preaches conservation 
gen john pietrowski commander in chief of the united states 
space command and the north american aerospace command puts in 
crowded workdays in his colorado springs headquarters but 
sometimes in the evenings i can slip away up into the mountains 
and fly fish 
i always like to match wits with a trout its great when you 
win but the alternative isnt desirable its very humbling to 
come home emptyhanded 
william horn assistant secretary of the interior is partial to 
fishing in montana alaska and wyoming but spends more time 
fishing on the east coast before i was working and got married 
and had kids i went fly fishing 40 or 50 times a year he says 
now im lucky if i go 15 times a year but i dream about it a 
lot 
i like companions who have the same appreciation for the 
sports traditions and ethics as i do and who provide just enough 
subtle competition on the stream to make it intriguing

editors note hes now the nations highest ranking black 
roman catholic prelate as atlantas new archbishop like the pope 
eugene antonio marino is regarded as a conservative in theology and 
a liberal on some social issues his first challenge he says will 
be to gather all the sheep into the fold regardless of color i 
intend to make this clear by the way i exercise my ministry rather 
than by anything i say 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after sunday mass at the roman catholic church 
across from the martin luther king jr memorial parishioners were 
discussing atlantas new archbishop eugene antonio marino 
hes a bishop who happens to be a black man the way doug 
williams is a black man who happens to be quarterback of the 
washington redskins ventured victor mclemore a black lawyer who 
is president of the parish council at our lady of lourdes 
you mean bishop marino already is a winner said father 
joseph cavallo the white pastor of the parish that for 75 years 
has been the mother church for atlantas black catholics 
at sacred heart parish on the opposite edge of the downtown 
business and hotel district where los angeles manager tom lasorda 
takes up the collection when the dodgers are in town the 
predominantly white congregation broke into applause when it was 
announced from the altar that atlanta would have the nations first 
black archbishop 
there was loud clapping too at the cathedral of christ the king 
out on peachtree road in buckhead atlantas yuppieland where 
parish council member richard farnsworth hailed the appointment as 
fitting for a city so prideful of its race relations 
still in deep shock over his new job marino arrived in town 
with an episcopal motto of feed my lambs that told a little 
about his priorities for the poor and homeless and a 
selfdeprecatory joke that told a lot about himself 
this may have come about through misdirected prayer some 
people were praying for a new archbishop and some were praying even 
more fervently for a strong backup quarterback for the falcons 
somebody up there sent in the wrong marino instead of dan from the 
miami dolphins they got eugene from the dc diocese 
his installation on may 5 became the hottest ticket in town 
while the atlanta braves were drawing fewer than 4000 after 
opening the season with 10 losses l0000 sought admission to the 
ceremony which already had been switched from the cathedral to the 
civic center seating 4600 
because of the pro basketball playoffs the archdiocese was 
unable to rent the omni where the democrats will hold their 
national convention in july and where the 54yearold archbishop 
might have matched rock star michael jackson in playing to a full 
house 
born in biloxi miss where he was an altar boy and rode his 
bike to ring the 6 am angelus bell at our mother of sorrows the 
nations now highest ranking black prelate is realist enough to 
know there are vast problems and some murmurs of dissent lurking 
beyond the applause 
the atlanta archdiocese stretches north to the south carolina 
line and covers 69 counties some of them lily white and pocketed 
with remnants of the ku klux klan the corporate queen city of the 
sun belt also witnessed in recent years a white flight to the 
northern suburbs just beyond the reach of the gleaming 
graffitifree subway line 
in some precincts marinos arrival is regarded as proof 
positive of what cab driver ray herston of smyrna tells his 
passengers atlanta is a black city they got andy young for 
mayor a black city council president a black chairman of fulton 
county and now a black archbishop 
in an overall population of 37 million of which about 1 
million are black the archdiocese counts 156000 catholics just 
under 10000 are black 
while acknowledging that his appointment gives the catholic 
church more visibility in the black community and is a sign of 
hope for all minorities marino recognizes that his first 
challenge will be to gather all the sheep into the fold 
regardless of color i intend to make this clear by the way i 
exercise my ministry rather than by anything i say 
with cubans moving in large numbers from miami and tampa into 
booming atlanta the archbishop wishes he had learned more spanish 
at home 
when his father jesus maria marino a baker in puerto rico 
migrated to biloxi and married lottie bradford the family which 
soon numbered eight children adopted mississippis black culture 
her father had helped build our mother of sorrows church which 
like our lady of lourdes in atlanta is a national parish with no 
regular boundaries serving the black community 
there was no telephone in the house when marino was growing up 
but there were always people poorer than we were he came 
straight home from the parish grammar and high school and 
knelt in the living room with the family each evening to recite the 
rosary he credits a strong catholic upbringing with putting him on 
the road to the priesthood at age 18 that he adds with a 
gentle laugh and the watchful eyes of six sisters one of whom 
is now a nun in baltimore

marino joined the josephites a community of blacks and whites 
founded in england after the american civil war to evangelize the 
emancipated slaves members have included antiwar activist philip 
berrigan and biloxi bishop joseph howzt among the 12 current 
american black bishops at the head of a diocese 
i never thought id see this in my lifetime a black bishop in 
biloxi and now a black archbishop in atlanta marino says 
a few weeks after his ordination on june 6 1962 young marino 
went into a biloxi coin laundry with his sister katherine without 
seeing the whites only sign in the window i wont say we 
were thrown out he wryly recalls but we left in kind of a 
hurry 
during his 14 years as an auxiliary in washington marino was a 
tireless advocate before congressional committees for civil rights 
the poor homeless and unborn and alternatives to prison 
a jogger and physical fitness fan he often stopped by the 
calvert winter shelter for homeless men across from st matthews 
cathedral on his way to doing the super circuit of exercise 
machines at the ymca on the corner 
the new archbishop will find the homeless on the increase in the 
bustling big peach where gentrification upgrading blighted 
neighborhoods with condos and town houses for yuppies and dinks 
double income no kids is making housing too expensive for even 
bluecollar whites and blacks 
from his pastoral work in the nations capital marino is no 
stranger to urban crime the drug scene and youth gangs which are 
also on the rise with atlantas economic growth he testified 
movingly before a legislative committee about drugs turning our 
cities into a nightmare of fear l3yearolds carrying automatic 
weapons killing for a jacket or a radio 
as vicar general of his order and later as secretary of the 
national conference of catholic bishops marino gained the 
reputation of being a priests priest colleagues having 
problems with alcohol church discipline or doctrine often confide 
in him his skills here will be tested early in atlanta 
a scandal erupted when a grand jury returned an indictment on 
charges of molesting four altar boys against a priest who was 
quietly allowed to return to his home diocese in england similar 
cases of pedophilia in recent years have resulted in payments of 
millions of dollars to victims by the dioceses of orlando fla 
new orleans and stpaulminneapolis 
just before marino took over an associate pastor in the same 
parish as the indicted priest was disciplined by church authorities 
and had to apologize from the altar after preaching at mass that 
the pope was dead wrong about celibacy the associate pastor 
suggested that contributed to the child molestation charges against 
his colleague and was responsible for l4 priests leaving the 
archdiocese in the past six years 
marinos appointment automatically makes him a national black 
leader at a time when the democrats mediaspotlighted by a 
powerful jesse jackson delegation will convene in the city that 
enshrines civil rights landmarks such as kings grave and the 
ebenezer baptish church and is home to coretta king andrew young 
julian bond and the southern christian leadership conference 
marino played a large role in arranging the meeting of pope john 
paul ii with black leaders in new orleans last fall and is one of 
the authors of what we have seen and heard a pastoral letter 
by american black bishops on the status of minorities in the church 
like the pope whom he greatly admires he is regarded as 
conservative in theology and liberal on some social issues 
during the 19year reign of archbishop thomas donnellan who 
died in october the atlanta archdiocese tripled in population and 
the number of parishes grew to 65 more than double 
when archbishop donnellan came st patricks day was big but 
now i think therell be a different emphasis mused cavallo 
certainly the church will be more comfortable in the black 
community where before it was more or less by invitation 
despite cross burnings and even church burnings in the past 
catholics have always been regarded as a lucky omen in atlanta 
on that november day in 1864 when gen william shermans troops 
burned the hotels the jail the slave market freight yards 
warehouses and almost eveything else in atlanta including the 
firehouse immaculate conception catholic church was saved after 
the rev thomas oreilly warned that irish draftees in union blue 
would mutiny at such a sacrilege sherman took the threat so 
seriously he spared the episcopal methodist presbyterian and 
baptist churches and also city hall which luckily was close by 
and the great atlanta fire of may 21 1917 stopped short of the 
business dictrict when catholics wetted down the roof of sacred 
heart church with all available holy water 
come what may marino is grateful to be absolved from that 
enduring airline joke bound for heaven or hell change at 
atlanta 
ive changed planes at this airport countless times he 
says but from now on out all my flights will either originate or 
terminate at atlanta

editors note at age 20 walter polovchak looks like many of 
his american peers brownhaired average build casually clad and 
wearing a gold chain around his neck he works in the mail room at 
a chicago public relations firm and aspires to be a tv anchorman 
eight years ago he became a media figure when he refused to return 
to the soviet union with his parents 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when the kid next door runs away from home hes 
liable to get in trouble with his folks when walter polovchak ran 
away from home at age 12 he created an international incident as 
the littlest defector 
eight years later the sovietborn polovchak now a us 
citizen and still a celebrity of sorts has written a book about 
his yearslong fight for a future in america 
the battle fought in the glare of intense media scrutiny 
pitted polovchak against his ukrainian parents the united states 
against the soviet union and bleak memories of a faraway village 
against the enticements of the american dream 
everybody says it was jello and bananas sure that was a 
little part of it polovchak says recalling his childs 
perspective when he decided to run away from his parents rather 
than return with them to the soviet ukraine 
but there were a lot of other things like freedoms of 
religion and the freedom of movement and freedom of speech 
polovchak has no doubts about the weighty decision he made as a 
child 
it was terrifying but now that i look back on it i have no 
regrets or anything like that he says 
freedoms child written by polovchak with kevin klose 
deputy national editor at the washington post and published by 
random house is intended to serve several purposes provide 
onthejobtraining for a media career help pay his college 
expenses and offer a message 
id like to get a point across to the american people that 
they should appreciate freedom and not take it for granted 
polovchak says 
at age 20 he looks like many of his american peers 
brownhaired average build casually clad and wearing a gold chain 
around his neck he works in the mail room at a chicago public 
relations firm 
he dates nobody special he says and likes movies cars and 
skiing 
and after years as a media subject polovchak wants to be a tv 
anchorman 
his story began in 1980 when his parents michael and anna 
polovchak decided to return to the ukraine after just six months 
in the united states 
walter and his sister natalie then 17 refused to go in july 
they moved in with a cousin walter polowczak 
polovchaks book chronicles the hectic years that followed the 
court hearings the conflicts with his parents the times he was 
guarded by special federal agents and the trauma of adjusting to a 
new country 
the fierce rebellion by a 12yearold startled the family and 
many others the soviet embassy insisted young walter had been 
kidnapped tass the soviet news agency said he had been bribed 
with promises of a bike and a car 
but polovchak said the groundwork for his revolt was laid in the 
ukrainian village of sambir 
one of the problems was that my family was never close 
polovchak says 
my father was home twice a week three times a week my mother 
was working afternoons my grandmother basically brought us up 
a year after his grandmothers death in 1979 the family came to 
chicago at the invitation of walters aunt 
but michael polovchak wanted to go back home almost from the 
start his son recalls 
runaway walter was granted asylum after the intervention of 
thendeputy secretary of state warren christopher an action his 
parents challenged in court natalies decision to stay behind was 
uncontested apparently because of her age 
the story of his years in the limelight is told in firstperson 
segments by polovchak his sister his cousin and numerous others 
with roles in the long drama julian kulas his ukrainian 
attorney the american civil liberties union which represented his 
parents and reporters 
i was brought up with reporters on an everyday basis 
polovchak recalls after a while it just became part of my 
life 
missing are the recollections of his parents who returned to 
the soviet union in 1981 they now live in the ukrainian village of 
lvov with two younger children walter has never seen his youngest 
sister julia born in 1983 
his fight to stay began in juvenile court after he was picked 
up as a runaway 
it ended in 1985 before a federal appeals court which ruled his 
parents rights had been violated by us government action that 
barred walter from leaving the country and ordered a trial on the 
issues 
but by the time the case reached that stage polovchak was 
nearly 18 he became a us citizen on oct 8 1985 five days 
after his birthday 
he receives little more than holiday greetings from his parents 
now 
im not mad at them walter says after all they are my 
parents i love them i just had to do what was best for me 
he wont consider visiting them because he is afraid he would be 
forced to stay in the soviet union 
kulas believes polovchaks cousin walter a computer operator 
and his nowmarried sister natalie helped young walter through 
adolescent crises 
even if he did go back i think the parents realize he would 
not have been with them very long kulas says 
he was the youngest defector we kept saying this really is a 
case about freedom 
the aclu contends many us government actions in the case were 
strictly political 
when all was said and donewe won every major legal 
decision for walters parents the groups chicago director jay 
miller is quoted as saying in the book 
yet walter won too the only people who lost were the 
parents 
movie rights are being negotiated for polovchaks story he 
remains a believer in the american dream 
this is a country where if you want to just get a job and 
barely survive or open your own company and be a millionaire you 
could be happy he says 
i mean if youve got your mind set on something do it 
thats what im basically doing

editors note the idea was to build a new capital city to open 
up and populate brazils empty central region that it did the 
gleaming futuristic city also lured throngs of miserably poor 
peasants hoping to find jobs nobody counted on the resulting 
overcrowding in a perimeter of satellite cities brasilia as one 
official puts it is now a fantasy island surrounded by misery 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was called the capital of hope and 
the capital of the future when it was built 28 years ago a 
modernistic city rising from scratch in the middle of a dry and 
barren prairie 750 miles from the sea 
today brazils capital has become both a capital of despair and 
a paradise of plenty a city of wretched poverty and gleaming 
opulence 
some say brasilia is the victim of its own success 
brasilia was a modern option and was useful because it did 
what it set out to do decentralize the country build new highways 
and transfer the seat of government says oscar niemeyer the 
architect of the slickwhite linear buildings that are brasilias 
landmarks 
but brasilia also symbolizes the spirit of brazil which is 
discriminatory and lacks social justice adds niemeyer now 81 
only a revolution will solve our problems 
built to sustain 2 million people by the year 2000 brasilias 
federal district already has a population of 17 million by the 
end of the century that number is expected to swell to 4 million 
a population the city cannot support under present conditions 
when it was planned the growth of the city was not imagined 
by anyone says federal district gov jose de oliveira aparecido 
it is now like a beautiful woman wearing old clothes it needs to 
be modernized 
today brasilia has the social ills of other large brazilian 
cities overcrowding shantytowns land invasions homeless 
children and traffic jams 
a lack of water magnified by a dry season which sponges 
soothing humidity from the air adds to brasilias woes 
although brasilia was planned to house the powerful who run the 
political and administrative machinery the poor are now the 
majority 
lured by the very promise of the citys founders the poor come 
in tattered clothes and plastic thongs to escape the drought and 
famine of the northeast 
they come to find their dreams but when they get here they 
realize its not the promised land aparecido says 
unable to survive in a city where only the affluent can afford 
to live they end up in one of brasilias 11 satellite cities 
located 15 to 80 miles away 
federal congresswoman maria de lourdes abadia has called 
brasilia a fantasy island surrounded by misery 
ceilandia one of the poorest satellite cities didnt exist in 
1970 and today has nearly half a million people 
a promised landreform program to distribute fertile land to 12 
million landless peasants is stalled attracting even more to the 
capital of hope 
brazil a developing nation larger than the continental united 
states has 143 million people and the worlds eighthlargest 
economy but 70 percent of its people live in dire poverty and earn 
less than 45 a week in a country which last year had inflation of 
366 percent 
unoccupied cultivable land is scarce and most of it belongs to 
just 4 percent of the population as it has for centuries 
without land without money or technology to improve their 
lives the rural workers will continue to invade the city 
niemeyer says 
brasilia was erected in a flash of resolve it was the campaign 
platform of president juscelino kubitschek who took office in 
1956 to create a capital that would unite the whole nation 
four years later on april 21 1960 as kubitschek promised 
brasilia was inaugurated 
at the time the capital was rio de janeiro a tropical city of 
spectacular mountains and beaches and a vibrant nightlife 
few wanted to move to an artificial barren city full of red 
dirt and brush land brasilia far inland in the state of goias 
didnt even have one river or spring 
but there was no choice many foreign embassies were threatened 
with losing accreditation if they didnt move to the new capital 
there was no way of avoiding it the lungs of brazil are in 
brasilia it is center of national power says aparecido often 
criticized because he spends much time visiting other capitals 
such as paris and rome 
last year largely through aparecidos efforts brasilia became 
the youngest city to be named by the united nations as a patrimony 
of mankind a cultural and historical heritage 
shaped like an airplane brasilias nucleus is called the 
pilot plan the design of architect and urbanist lucio costa 
now 86 
in brasilias cockpit is the government the futuristic 
marbled buildings which carry the unmistakable swirling seal of 
architect niemeyer 
visitors are drawn to the marbled and spacious presidential 
palace where president jose sarney on most fridays makes a grand 
exit walking down a swooping ramp to his limousine 
the twintowered whitedomed congress where lawmakers are 
writing a new constitution inside chambers connected by underground

like rows of disciplined soldiers identical government 
ministries line a wide esplanade that leads into the residential 
and commercial sectors 
in the wings of the brasilian plane are businesses and 
apartments called the superquadras or superblocks identified 
only by letters and numbers most superquadras have their own large 
supermarket and smaller bread shops a brazilian version of 
stopandgo shopping 
landscape artist roberto burle marx relieved brasilias cool 
uniformity with a mosaic of gardens and trees the idea was to 
accentuate the wide horizons and open sky of a city that had no 
hills forest or sea 
brasilia was not planned for pedestrians by car it is easy and 
fast to drive down its avenues and looping highways 
but it is difficult and slow to get around if you are one of the 
million who pour in daily from the satellite cities to work there 
arent enough buses fares are expensive and the ride can be 
dangerous bad drivers as well as poorly maintained buses account 
for 200 accidents a month 
maria dos santos a maid who works in brasilia earns 70 
dollars a month she she spends half that to take three buses into 
the city 
besides the satellite cities some 10 favelas portuguese 
for ghettos or shantytowns have recently sprung up including one 
a couple of miles from the alvorada palace where sarney resides 
an empty lot usually government property is an invitation for 
squatters to build cardboard houses recently 900 descended on a 
plot next to a trendy apartment building 
with no water or electricity the settlement was a health hazard 
as well as an eyesore eventually police on horseback torched the 
shacks and dispersed the squatters 
to keep migrants away the government has begun paying families 
to return to their home states in its initial stage few are 
taking up the offer 
the cost of living in brasilia is about the same as in rio or 
sao paulo but the quality of life can be better for the welltodo 
in brasilia 
for example in the residential area surrounding an artificial 
lake a threebedroom house with a pool rents for about 1000 a 
month in rio it would be double that 
apartments in brasilia rent for about 200 to 600 a month 
depending on the desirability of the block 
aparecido boasts brasilia has the best quality of life of any 
city in brazil where else can you have such space for so little 
that applies only to the elite 
in ceilandia a simple onebedroom house with just a kitchen and 
bath rents for about 50 a month about as much as the occupant 
could hope to earn 
brasilia has expensive restaurants and cheap restaurants 
nothing in between with prices at the fine restaurants varying 
from 20 to 40 for two people 
middlelevel professionals such as university professors and 
bankers earn 800 to 1000 a month a lot by brazilian standards a 
member of congress however gets 7000 a month tax exempt 
for fun the poor stay in their satellite cities if they come 
in they can hang out in one of the many corner bars which sell the 
popular and cheap sugar cane liquor called cachaca or go to a 
movie a meal at a simple restaurant can be less than 5 a person 
the affluent go to one of the dozen tennis golf or sailing 
clubs along the lake which charge a membership of 60 to 100 a 
month 
since every other lakeside house has a swimming pool 
entertaining at home is popular theres not much else to do with 
few museums theaters and concerts available for either the poor or 
rich 
niemeyer and costa have plans for new residential areas to take 
the weight off the districts overloaded plane 
some officials say brasilias most crucial problem is lack of 
water 
the main dam built in the 1960s to supply water for 350000 
people is serving at least twice that many the artificial lake 
used as a humidifier and for sewage drainage is polluted and 
infested with hardy weeds 
for nearly six months a year brasilias humidity levels dip to 
below 20 percent last year levels dropped to 7 percent the 
average at the sahara desert is 13 percent what the world health 
organizaton says is the limit for humans 
water rationing is now standard during the dry season but city 
water officials foresee harder times 
we need funds to buy technology to clean up the lake and build 
another dam and another lake says valdo roholf vice president of 
brasilias water company we say it will be cheaper than building 
a new capital

i would guess ted kennedy might be the exception to the 
rule says joe grandmaison democratic party chairman in new 
hampshire after youve said youre not going to go for the brass 
ring theres a tendency for you to slip into a lessthanrelevant 
position 
back in massachusetts kennedy is preparing for a senate 
campaign holding town meetings throughout the state even though 
national gop strategists hold out little hope of unseating him his 
opponent is former republican state executive director joe malone 
kennedy has made his fifth reelection bid a family affair his 
26yearold son ted and 27yearold daughter kara are cochairs 
of the reelection effort 
critics say that kennedys liberal politics are out of step with 
the american public and even his own party 
hes the ultraliberal says alexander tennant executive 
director of the massachusetts republican party hes somewhat out 
of touch with the average working person 
he believes in government solving problems and i think a lot 
of younger people today believe in free enterprise and helping 
others to help themselves not building a huge bureaucracy where 
government is big brother 
and opponents point to the rupert murdoch flap started when 
kennedy quietly pushed through an amendment to prevent the 
publisher from keeping both tv stations and newspapers in boston 
and new york as an example of arrogance 
later this year he likely will face another wave of controversy 
when a washington publishing house releases a new book about his 
1969 accident at chappaquiddick that killed passenger mary jo 
kopechne the book charges that there was a conspiracy to cover up 
kennedys role in the accident 
kennedys popularity in massachusetts overcame the shadows of 
chappaquiddick but the accident loomed large in his presidential 
campaign many believe the senators action swimming to safety 
when kopechne was trapped in the car and not reporting the accident 
until 10 hours later blocked him from the white house 
author leo damore says in his new book senatorial privilege 
the chappaquiddick coverup that kennedy initially wanted to tell 
police that mary jo kopechne was alone in the car when it plunged 
off the bridge 
the book to be published in june by regnery gateway is based 
on exclusive interviews with joseph gargan a cousin and close 
friend of the senator who along with another friend paul markham 
returned to the bridge to try to rescue miss kopechne from the 
submerged car 
kennedy was having alternative ideas about the situation 
damore wrote why couldnt mary jo have been driving the car why 
couldnt she have let him off and driven to the ferry herself and 
made a wrong turn 
but gargan reportedly rejected the idea noting that the three 
did not even know if miss kopechne could drive or had a license 
the book says kennedy did not decide to tell police that he was 
driving until speaking by telephone with aide david burke it took 
about 10 hours for kennedy to report the accident an action that 
he later called irrational and indefensible and inexcusable and 
inexplicable 
kennedy now says running for president again has to be 
considered unlikely 
yet even if a democrat is elected this year and reelected in 
1992 kennedy would only be 64 by the time the next presidential 
year rolls around in 1996 
who knows what the future brings kerry says in politics 
all things are possible

the trouble with gary according to actor 
peter horton is that he doesnt want to face the fact that hes 
not going to be another homer or milton 
gary shepherd michaels oldest friend and best man at michaels 
marriage to hope on abcs thirtysomething simply doesnt want 
to grow up hes a free spirit and hes having too much fun 
besides hes terrified 
at the moment gary is having a fantasy dressed as a viking 
sword in hand he is confronting the tenure board at the 
philadelphia college where he is a classics professor 
horton stands on a tall ladder beside the raised camera 
looking down at the tenure committee grouped around a conference 
table technicians blow smoke about the room to enhance the 
dreamlike atmosphere 
in my fantasy this is the way id love to treat the tenure 
committee he explains later i come in like errol flynn and 
bellow i challenge you all ive been turned down for tenure 
ive been teaching for seven years but i havent been 
conforming to the policies of the institution so they wont give 
it to me it has to do with gary growing up its eminently 
satisfying but its not a very realistic way to react when youre 
a kid youre passionate for idealism but you have to temper it as 
you grow up or your idealism is useless 
horton notes that in real life he was kicked out of principia 
college in illinois for a similar attitude he later finished at 
the university of california at santa barbara my best course was 
miltons paradise lost he says my worst course was biology 
202 i never studied beowulf until i got this role 
the crew is at the wilshire ebell theater to film the sequence 
for the show which focuses on a group of socalled yuppies and 
has become a favorite of college students and the upwardly mobile 
thirtyish generation for the past season it was tied for 46th 
place and among new shows it was tied for eighth place 
the show also stars ken olin as michael mel harris as hope 
timothy busfield polly draper melanie mayron and patricia wettig 
it was created by marshall herskovitz and edward zwick 
the episode which was telecast earlier this month ended with 
gary losing tenure and appealing the decision 
gary is a passionate teacher whose speciality is the classical 
epic such as beowulf and the iliad unfortunately it 
doesnt have much relevance to todays world he would like to be 
like one of his classical heroes but his discipline melts when 
theres an opportunity to go to bed with a pretty coed 
gary represents the character in all of us who is afraid to 
grow up says horton who has long blond hair and a thick growth 
of stubble on his chin i think the main reason for that is that 
hes afraid to admit the end of his potential when youre growing 
up you have a fantasy of what your potential is but at some point 
you have to come to terms with it he has to face the fact that 
hes not going to be a homer or a milton or a mozart or even a 
college professor 
hes very intelligent and on some levels very wise he sleeps 
around but hes honest about it he has his own morality theres 
a much deeper reality to everyday living how do you define 
yourself are you able to be a loyal friend and love people gary 
is a much better friend to michael than i am to my friends 
in the show gary and michael were high school friends who went 
to college together they were involved in politics and 
demonstrations 
but as we got older he went into the corporate world and i 
tried to stay the same says horton that provides a lot of the 
tension in our relationship he has a sense of guilt for his 
perception that he has forsaken his youthful ideals on the other 
hand he has become a responsible adult and is a constant reminder 
to me of what i should be doing 
horton was born in bellevue wash but his fathers shipping 
business took him as a youngster to hong kong japan thailand and 
the philippines i remember once in bangkok a monkey came flying 
out of a tree and landed on my shoulders he says i was in 
heaven we spent some time on cargo ships once we hit a big storm 
and my sister and i put socks on our hands and feet and slid all 
over the place 
he got his degree in music composition and planned to become a 
conductor i got into acting by accident he says i 
auditioned for a repertory company in santa barbara as a pianist i 
needed the money i ended up studying with them and stayed for nine 
months 
horton appeared in three movies before thirtysomething and 
in his short career has done almost as much directing as acting he 
has directed several episodes of the series an abc afterschool 
special a segment of the movie amazon women on the moon and 
has several projects in development 
i thought i was going to be a conductor he says but 
directing is a lot like conducting

director ingmar bergman has said it took him 50 
years to find someone to play his kind of hamlet 
the man he chose to portray shakespeares melancholy dane was a 
lanky lean and wildhaired actor named peter stormare who until 
he was 22 had never seen a play 
i grew up in the middle of nowhere the 34yearold stormare 
said recently describing the small swedish village of arbro where 
he was raised it was football or drinking wine and beer or going 
around in cars you were not allowed to say no im staying home 
this saturday night to read a poem or try to write a novelette or 
do a painting i did have that inside me 
it took a while but stormare is now a leading member of the 
royal dramatic theater of sweden a worldclass theater troupe that 
is best known to americans as the company which staged the world 
premiere of eugene oneills long days journey into night in 
1956 
stormares hamlet directed by bergman will be seen in the 
united states june 816 at the brooklyn academy of music before the 
royal dramatic theater of sweden moves on to a tour of japan and 
the soviet union 
stormare looks more like a rock said he was the only stagehand i 
met who wanted an explanation or a motivation for bringing a chair 
on stage 
when he wasnt moving the scenery about stormare took acting 
lessons from wigren 
we started with a fourline poem thats very well known in 
sweden stormare remembers i struggled with that poem for half 
a year trying to understand it its a wonderful little poem but i 
hate it now 
finally stormare was accepted by the drama school which usually 
only admits 12 students out of the more than 1000 that apply each 
year 
if you want to become a good actor in sweden you go there 
stormare says he stayed for three years taking classes for 10 
months of the year 
i was like a kid at a fair stormare recalls the school 
had everything for its students even guitars we often spent the 
nights playing the guitar 
when he graduated stormare joined the royal dramatic theater 
critics and audiences first noticed him in a production of class 
enemy by british playwright nigel williams bergman also saw his 
galvanizing portrayal of a young london street punk 
the 69yearold director cast him in a small role in the film 
fanny and alexander stormare later appeared in bergmans stage 
productions of king lear and miss julie their latest 
project together has been a critically praised revival of long 
days journey into night in which stormare plays the troubled son 
edmund 
bergman is possessed by storytelling says stormare 
explaining why the man is such a great director its a kind of 
simplicity in a way he uses plays and films to tell his own 
story his heart is in everyone thats what makes him so 
international

down through the ages romania originally the 
region of dacia has seen trouble and turmoil in its early days it 
was overrun by goths huns avars bulgars magyars and mogols 
after that came the ottoman turks and later russians in the role of 
protectors in world war i romania was on the side of the allies 
in world war ii it joined the germanled axis it fell into the 
soviet bloc after that but more recently has asserted an 
independence of moscow but is in trouble with the west today 
romanians struggle again this time with privation imposed upon 
them by their communist government 
</TEXT>

on workday mornings romanians bustle 
through the streets and pile into buses and streetcars well 
dressed and determined they present the picture of a modern 
society going to work 
but a closer look reveals a people struggling a nation with 
problems 
the first clue is the shopping bag everyone has a shopping bag 
the second clue is in the eyes the eyes dart from shop window 
to shop window looking for eggs flour sugar bread cooking oil 
meat anything on the list of staples in short supply 
in what was once the breadbasket of europe romanians are forced 
to live with food rationing the lack of heat in winter dim 
lighting at night little gasoline for their cars 
they are a nation of privation the result of president nicolae 
ceausescus economic gambles in 1970s and early 1980s 
romanians are seeing the fruits of their labors flow into the 
export market while they are deprived of imported goods as 
ceausescu seeks to pay the nations foreign debt through austerity 
at home 
around corners away from the main streets people stand in 
lines that sometimes stretch the length of a block waiting for a 
daily ration of bread or a bottle of milk 
at 600 am one recent day a woman was seen handing bottles of 
milk out of a grating at the side of a shop the store itself is 
closed and dark the dawn transactions seemed outside official 
sanction 
when bread is available people tote it away by the armfuls 
sometimes biting off chunks as they make their way home 
pedestrians who have managed to find eggs weave precariously 
through traffic careful not to break any 
except in major hotels the lighting is kept low to save 
electricity escalators in department stores have stopped running 
not long ago things looked much better for romanians the nation 
still had oil and natural gas agricultural abundance and a budding 
heavy industry ceausescu dealt more with the west which made him 
a maverick in the soviet bloc 
ceausescus crash economic development stressed energyintensive 
industries such as petrochemicals aluminum and steel but with 
dwindling domestic oil reserves romania had to rely on imports to 
feed huge oilrefining complexes built in the 1960s and the early 
1970s when oil was cheap 
romania also had to borrow heavily from the west and by 1981 the 
foreign debt had reached more than 11 billion 
ceausescu has never explained his reasoning for pursuing a 
course that has brought so much hardship to his 23 million people 
some romanians and western diplomats say it is personal ambition 
ceausescu has built a personality cult around him unrivaled by 
other current sovietbloc leaders 
even his east bloc allies criticize him and he has estranged 
himself from the west which he once courted as it courted him he 
no longer has special trade privileges with the united states 
romania is drawing more and more into isolation as its people 
struggle to live from one day to the next 
they face cold winters in badly heated and dimly lit apartments 
because of the decline in oil resources from an annual production 
of 980 million barrels a decade ago to 70 million now 
the use of private cars has been banned four winters in a row 
gasoline is rationed 
people park their cars in lines at gas stations even though 
they are closed to be ready for the next delivery of gasoline 
the bright spring in romania with flowers in full bloom people 
carrying fresh bouquets and women chicly dressed in western 
styles hides the strains of a hard winter just past the daily 
struggle for food and the lack of freedom of information and of 
speech 
public dissent is muted due to what western diplomats call 
the romanian character romanians have seldom revolted and to 
an effective repressive apparatus

about 10000 people marched in the central city of brasov this 
past november to demand higher wages more food and for ceausescu 
to resign but the diplomats say the formation of a mass movement 
like the solidarity trade union in poland is unlikely in romania 
romanians express their dissatisfaction only in whispers 
one whispered story intended as a joke is about a romanian who 
regularly asks at communist party meetings where has all the 
meat gone he soon disappears when his companion asks what 
happened to his friend he is greeted with stony silence 
since the brasov protest diplomats have noted tightened 
security and more uniformed militia in towns and cities 
foreigners movements are increasingly restricted some western 
journalists have been picked up by police or expelled 
romanians are obliged to report any contacts with foreigners 
many refuse even to answer a foreigners request for directions 
even the few officials allowed to give interviews to foreigners 
do so only on condition they are not identified by name 
ceausescu has come under increasing pressure from the west and 
even the east bloc over human rights 
neighboring hungary an ally in the east blocs warsaw pact has 
voiced unprecedented criticism of what it sees as discrimination 
against romanias ethnic hungarian minority a highly sensitive 
issue for romanian authorities 
an ap reporter traveling recently through transylvania in the 
north where most of the 2 million ethnic hungarians and 220000 
ethnic germans live was picked up by police and told to return 
immediately to bucharest the capital 
despite attempts to attract western currency through tourism 
foreigners and foreign cars are rare in romania 
children wave and smile when a foreign car passes drivers of 
the romanianmade dacia car which dominates the roads often flash 
their lights in greeting 
a more common sight in the countryside are horsedrawn carts 
carrying livestock or hay and exhausted slumbering farm workers 
the countryside reveals lush green wheat fields rich red earth 
freshly tilled for planting fat pigs and large herds of sheep but 
the eye is often jarred by sprawling chemical plants puffing black 
smoke out over the pastures 
vegetable supplies at private markets are sparse mainly root 
vegetables or great mounds of paprika spice there is no fruit 
while city dwellers line up for hours for food and other 
essentials peasants and villagers must often trudge miles to get 
their produce to market 
officials say a plan to establish agroindustrial centers and to 
modernize cities is aimed at improving living standards 
an official from the national council of city halls said the 
project is designed to put industry at the source of raw materials 
and provide hospitals schools and social services for more people 
in the new centers he said one family member could work in 
industry while the rest tilled the land thus preventing the 
traditional drift from rural to urban communities 
the average monthly wage in romania is 3035 lei 347 at the 
official rate of exchange but farmers income is lower 
the agroindustrial centers could mean that as many 6000 
villages eventually will vanish 
its going to the heart of romanian society a diplomat 
said noting the project makes it easier to control people and will 
strip peasants of what independence they now have 
in cities modernization has led to widespread demolition 
in bucharest for example 28 churches and synagogues have been 
destroyed to make way for a palatial center to house communist 
party headquarters the building looks out over an avenue more than 
a half mile long lined with sculpted white apartment blocks and 
derisively called the champs elysees of the balkans by 
romanians 
work on the project is done night and day as the city falls 
into darkness with only dim street lighting the floodlit 
construction dominates the skyline

this picturesque city is the cultural heart 
of romanias hungarian minority who have become a cause of 
friction between two soviet bloc allies 
for centuries hungarians romanians and germans fought over and 
settled the historic region of transylvania they developed a rich 
culture and a tradition so intertwined that no part of transylvania 
seems exclusively characteristic of one nationality 
but since the mid1980s this cultural blend has been upset by 
an escalating war of words between romania and hungary which have 
long contested each others claims to transylvania 
the hungarian government charges that romania is discriminating 
against 2 million ethnic hungarians by deemphasizing the hungarian 
language in education diluting hungarian culture by moving more 
romanians into traditional hungarian areas and sending hungarians 
to work in romanian areas 
similar actions are being taken against transylvanias 220000 
ethnic germans but the germans have been emigrtating to west 
germany at a rapid rate 
since april official publications in the hungarian and german 
languages have been allowed to use only romanian versions of place 
names reports also are circulating that romanian authorities no 
longer are registering typical hungarian names for hungarian babies 
and that this could also lead to the banning of hungarian family 
names 
many street signs in cluj are still in both hungarian and 
romanian but in tirgu mures a town that is 50 percent hungarian 
40 miles to the east the signs are only in romanian 
hungarian is spoken openly in the region however in cluj 
where about 35 to 40 percent of the population is hungarian roman 
catholic mass is celebrated daily in hungarian 
but the hungarians are not allowed to subscribe to publications 
from hungary 
five years ago clujs university offered instruction in 
hungarian and romanian but today hungarian is used only in one 
course hungarian philology which has just five students 
the german minority has been decreasing steadily for years 
dropping from 800000 in 1939 to some 220000 today 
ethnic german emigration to west germany is so rapid that one 
small church has seen its parishioners decline from 2000 to just 
over 300 in seven years

nicolae ceausescus romania is 
becoming increasingly isolated from both east and west its austere 
economic and human rights policies are under fire from both sides 
the official media of romanias allies in the east blocs warsaw 
pact frequently assail ceausescus economic austerity at home 
contending that the privation it has imposes upon the nations 23 
million people is excessive 
in the west romania is criticized on human rights grounds the 
united states for example had given most favored nation status 
but as a condition for continuing the trade benefits the status 
afforded romania the united states told ceausescu he had to 
improve human rights conditions freedom of speech and religion 
and the freedom to emigrate if one wanted to 
rather than submit to those conditions romania opted out of the 
us special trading privileges in february 
the result is that romania finds itself in virtual isolation 
although at one time it had played a role as an important mediator 
accepted by east and west in the middle east 
ceausescu maintains good relations with yasser arafat the 
palestine liberation organization leader and romania was the only 
soviet bloc country not to break diplomatic relations with israel 
during the arabisraeli war in 1967 
romania also has been cool to mikhail s gorbachevs reforms in 
the soviet union and the soviet leader countered a year ago during 
a visit to bucharest with an attack on corruption and nepotism 
nepotism is a sensitive issue in romania where ceausescus wife 
son brother and brotherinlaw hold high posts in the communist 
party and government 
president richard m nixon paved the way for improved relations 
with romania with a visit in 1969 and president gerald r ford came 
in 1979 now the most senior us visitor has been deputy 
secretary of state john c whitehead who expressed regret after a 
visit this year that he couldnt get the human rights concerns 
through to ceausescu 
ceausescu fell into further western disfavor in january when the 
romanian press published greetings from britains queen elizabeth 
ii and the monarchs of spain sweden and belgium on his 70th 
birthday 
all turned out to be fakes

rambo iii features more of the cartoonish 
roadrunnerstyle violence of its predecessors with the 
slowtalking fastshooting fighting machine joining horsemounted 
holy warriors to subdue soviet armor 
its the same invincible john j rambo that delighted president 
reagan at the time of the twa hijacking in beirut in 1985 after 
seeing rambo last night i know what to do the next time this 
happens reagan joked 
thats wrong stallone says hotly rambo goes in to end 
conflicts not initiate them he didnt go in to kick the russians 
butts he went in to get his friends out 
david morrell the former iowa state english professor who 
introduced rambo in the novel first blood says he also was 
offended by reagans jest 
i cant say i was amused morrell said because i was 
distressed by the interpretation of the character but i was 
bemused because its a way of being told how powerful the character 
is so i was gratified by that 
rambo first blood part ii grossed 150 million in us 
theaters spawned a line of fighting dolls and fearsome squirt guns 
and made rambo a part of the language 
reagans joke marked the first time that any associated press 
story from washington mentioned rambo but other references 
followed reagan invoked rambo again on behalf of tax reform in 
september 1985 but mostly rambo became a term of abuse hurled by 
democrats 
i see where rambo is now it with the young former vice 
president walter mondale said three years ago complaining of a 
rambo streak in the white house war is great you can shoot 
and wont be shot complexity is blown away by simple violence 
stallone and morrell who recently came to new york to promote 
the film both say rambo is a man of peace not a jingoistic 
murderer but a celluloid descendant of the frontier gunslinger 
forced into one last battle 
i find it incredible stallone says his voice rising 
every time some local atrocity occurs where a man puts on fatigue 
pants and takes a rifle and goes into a shopping center its 
rambo murderer slays three 
rambo doesnt kill innocents hes never killed unarmed 
children 
in 1985 a 17yearold in missouri who had seen first blood 
half a dozen times put on camouflage gear picked up a kitchen 
knife and a pistol and attacked his neighbors he was convicted of 
assault burglary and armed criminal action 
i can philosophically put it into this bag that this child 
was an accident waiting to happen stallone says if it wasnt 
rambo it was going to be another fictional character which he 
would just use as his i dont know his primer cord 
i keep close watch of this and i know of only six cases in 
which the rambo character was blamed for violent events says 
morrell three were in the united states he said and the others 
in england australia and canada 
when i look into these things what happened was that we were 
dealing with psychotics people who were unbalanced if it hadnt 
been one thing it would have been that their rice krispies didnt 
snap crackle and pop properly in the morning 
so what does rambo stand for that depends in part whether 
its the books or the films 
morrell who had rambo criticizing us policy in central 
america in his book of rambo ii had suggested setting the 63 
million rambo iii in nicaragua 
stallone nixed that in part because he didnt want another 
jungle picture but if rambo fears anything its controversy 
until that conflict is really over or until the line of 
demarcation is drawn then i cant jump into that stallone 
said of nicaragua 
afghanistan however was one place where congress and reagan 
agreed on who wore the black hats 
you have 300 million russians vs 12 million afghans who are 
undernourished underarmed undertrained and they are holding their 
own finally after 8 years they are receiving some assistance 
stallone said 
but rambo doesnt go in to fight russians when they accuse me 
or my characters of redbashing that is irresponsible because he 
never says im gonna get that dirty commie it never came out of 
his mouth 
gee maybe it was all the exploding russians in rambo ii or 
the hulking soviet boxer in rocky iv that gave the impression 
that stallone harbors strong feelings about moscow 
i used to think i did he said i understand glasnost 
and the soviets need to do this im all for glasnost i 
think the military branch is totally out of line and theyve made 
mistakes and this is their vietnam

perhaps the real villain in rambos world is the us government 
in first blood which became a film in 1982 rambo wages war 
against a sheriff who was a decorated hero of the korean war the 
story ends with an innocent american town in flames 
in rambo ii he was stranded in enemy territory by a 
cynical lying highlevel bureaucrat who was covering up the 
presence of american prisoners in vietnam 
the worst that can be said of the us embassy official in 
rambo iii is that hes a little brusque 
morrell regards the rambos ii and iii as exhibitions of special 
effects 
nobody is pretending that this is great art he says 
when rambo iii was screened for critics here tristar 
pictures filled out the audience with adolescent males who cheered 
the title cheered the first glimpse of stallones face cheered 
rambos knife and cheered his bow and arrow 
a head goes through a windshield yeah trautman is strung 
up by his arms hahaha rambo turns a soviet soldier into an 
exploding yoyo yeah 
who are you the soviet commander radios your worst 
nightmare rambo grunts and the kids dig it 
ooooooooooooooo 
as absurdities piled up even the critics were laughing at mass 
slaughter 
in the first book which had a body count in excess of 200 
compared to two or three deaths in the first film morrell had 
this explanation for rambo 
he had killed a great many people and he could pretend their 
deaths were necessary because they were all a part of what was 
pushing him making it impossible for someone like him to get 
along but he did not totally believe it he had enjoyed the fight 
too much 
stallone feels the impulse to violence even his lincoln hawk 
the gentle armwrestling father in over the top cracked a few 
jaws and crashed a truck into a mansion 
i find myself frustrated when words prove futile stallone 
says youre philosophically right and youre morally right and 
you somehow cannot get your way you dont get respect you dont 
get listened to so you become frustrated 
yes i feel that way a lot stallone admits but i take it 
out usually in my scripts 
like when you say the exploding yoyo the soviet who 
explodes the reason is rather than just have him die or be hung 
to have him selfimmolate that to me is kind of a blatant message 
that that kind of evil doesnt deserve a resting place 
the rambo of the books has a hamlet streak to kill or not to 
kill but stallones rambo wont talk about selfdefense or just 
wars his audience he says doesnt want lectures 
they know the essence of the character and they know what he 
does best and they want to get to it he says 
stallone is already thinking about rambo iv scouting the 
globe for a crisis where one mean dude could lend a hand 
panama is leading up to be a very interesting situation 
says stallone who regards gen manuel antonio noriega as the 
perfect villain 
could you cast a better man seriously i mean hes godsent 
good guy bad guy the face the look his own private army the 
drugs i mean the canal itself the importance incredible 
thats a scenario 
so back to the jungle 
yeah go down and teach him how to breakdance stallone 
growls have a little rap session at noriegas house this 
weekend

sticks stones tanks and helicopters cant hurt 
rambo but critical words are sharper than death for sylvester 
stallone 
oh yeah it hurts says stallone and he remembers some that 
stung 
like this is a guy who should now consider going to 
louisiana and become a bayou fisherman thats a little rough or 
when someone will say his career is stranger than crib death 
it hurts so much he laughs 
in one way it is very humorous but if i said these things to 
a child the kid would be in an institution by the time he was 
12 he would have no ego hed be gone said stallone who was 
grinding through a full day of interviews to promote the 63 
million rambo iii 
ive seen a lot of actors they get on a bad roll and they 
keep descending and the critics keep pounding on them and maybe 
rightly so but too harshly i mean lighten up a little bit or 
youll kill that character 
rambo iii follows the failure of over the top in which 
stallone played a trucker who wins his sons affection in part 
through armwrestling in over the top i just felt that the 
movie was what it was a simple little movie he said it was 
sold i think improperly because people perceived it as this big 
action epic and it wasnt 
stallone 41 was all but unknown when rocky burst on the 
screen in 1976 made for 11 million rocky took in more than 
45 million at the box office won an academy award for best 
picture and received bestactor and bestscreenplay nominations 
for stallone 
later films have made more money but none has enjoyed that kind 
of critical success 
rambo iii figures to be criticproof returning to the 
violenceladen formula that carried rambo ii to a worldwide box 
office of 270 million 
people say yeah youre giggling all the way to the bank 
said stallone who picked up nearly 20 million for reprising his 
role 
no no the money is a result of the success of the film but 
if you are perceived as a failure in the eyes of your peers you 
see what i mean you have a problem 
it reminds me of the character in east of eden jett rink 
remember that when he has a banquet and no one shows up hes a 
billionaire and he stands there all alone and he collapses on the 
table seating for a thousand and hes all alone 
stallone though expects to keep going for a while and he 
joked about a sequel way down the line we find out that rambo 
had a brother and its rocky balboa and they meet and we do like 
a hayley mills split screen he said 
we could keep this baby going on forever i know were 
reaching its getting kind of thin on plot but lets go for it 
stallone has gotten this far on the script 
why dont you cut your hair brother 
noooooo 
meanwhile hes scouting ideas for rambo iv and getting 
ready for rocky v and even talking about cobra ii 
when it comes to his characters stallone is no killer 
its hard not if i like them no i really cant he said 
because i think people die a hundred times over when you keep 
them alive when their honor is gone and theyve been shamed 
publicly or their manhood has been impugned irreparably whew 
death is easy living is hard 
in terms of critical acceptance stallone thinks maybe he should 
have followed david morrells book first blood and killed 
rambo in the first film it was shot that way at first but wasnt 
palatable to test audiences or to the star 
he was a psycho in the book and being true to that character 
he wiped out everyone stallone said 
and i think it would have been a great movie on that level 
too but it would have been a harsh expose i think it would have 
received more accolades that this was an important film like 
platoon or coming home if we had stayed with it because that 
really would have been an indictment 
stallone has talked about playing a hasidic cowboy or doing a 
film on religion one project hes given up is starring as edgar 
allen poe in a screenplay he wrote years ago 
audiences just wouldnt buy it he said 
id be saying once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered 
weak and weary and you know someone would say remember when he 
used to carry a gun the image of the long hair and headband would 
like woooooaaaaah be superimposed 
whats he gonna say yo quoth the raven yo poe

english profressor david morrell had been 
thinking about the returning veterans in his classes and about a 
world war ii hero when he began work in 1969 on his first novel 
published in 1972 first blood had an angry hero named 
rambo ten years later it became a movie starring sylvester 
stallone 
the original intent was that the first novel would be an 
antiwar novel to make vivid what it would be like to have a 
war in the united states like what was going on in asia how 
senseless it was morrell said 
a secondary theme was the stress suffered by returning veterans 
the inspiration came from veterans in his classes morrell said 
and from the life of audie murphy the actor who was americas most 
decorated gi in world war ii 
audie murphy had done a film called to hell and back in 
which he dramatized his experiences in the war morrell said 
before his death in 1971 he had begun a book talking about the 
problems he had after coming home morrell added 
the movie version of first blood was generally faithful to 
the book both told of a fight which began with a smalltown 
sheriff leaning on an unkempt drifter and ended with a town in 
flames from the rage of a single vietnam veteran 
in the book rambos body count exceeded 200 including some 
national guardsmen shot in retreat in the film he killed two or 
three 
rambo ended the book full of bullet holes and with his head 
blown off by his former commanding officer in the movie he walked 
off in handcuffs ready for sequels 
morrell doesnt mind at all in fact he wrote books based on 
the first sequel rambo first blood part ii and the upcoming 
rambo iii as well as the first draft of the script for rambo 
iii 
rambo ii was not only a much bigger film than rambo i 
but it made the character part of the nations political vocabulary 
i sort of have to chuckle at that that i should have invented 
a character whose name has entered the language morrell said 
as i look back in my lifetime i guess the only novelist who did 
the same is joseph heller with catch22 
morrell owns stock in carolco the production company that 
bought the film and merchandising rights for rambo 
i have profit participation in the pictures and i do have 
profit participation in the merchandising and i also get a flat 
fee whenever they make a feature said the author who came to 
new york with stallone and costar richard crenna to promote the 
film and as you might expect its been lucrative 
morrell owns the literary copyright so he gets the lions share 
of book profits rambo first blood part ii was a best seller 
even before the film came out 
morrells brotherhood of the rose a book without rambo was 
picked up by nbctv as the basis for a miniseries planned for next 
season 
first blood was written while morrell was earning a 
doctorate at penn state university and he went on to teach at iowa 
state university before becoming a fulltime writer in 1986 
one of the ironies of the rambo phenomenon is that neither 
morrell nor stallone had any part in the vietnam war born in 
canada morrell was 23 when he came to the united states in 1967 
and like stallone he was something of a tough kid 
my father died in the second world war i never knew the 
man said morrell who grew up in kitchenerwaterloo near 
toronto i was raised by my mother who was a single parent for 
quite a while and was forced to give me up at times to a foster 
home 
later we didnt have very much money we didnt get a phone 
until i was 12 i spent most of my time in back alleys with street 
gangs the guys i hung around with went to prison i became a 
professor 
his salvation was the tv show route 66 morrell identified 
with george maharis streetwise character and he wrote a fan 
letter to series writer sterling silliphant 
silliphants reply encouraging his young correspondent to take 
a stab at writing is framed and hanging on a wall at home in iowa 
city morrell said 
the rambo books he said deal in some serious issues but are 
basically escapism 
life for most people is at best boring and i use boring 
almost in an existential sense as sartre does in nausea where it 
weighs you down and you have a powerful sense of what is my reason 
for getting up this morning 
as his 15yearold son lay dying of cancer last year morrell 
said books helped him survive 
id be sitting there for like eight hours at a time and i 
would be reading a book by my friend stephen king and i dont know 
if i could have stayed sane for those eight hours if it hadnt been 
for steve 
i could not have read john updike under those circumstances 
it would have been too real morrell said what i needed to do 
was get out of that room and in a sense get out of my head and 
steve did it for me so if i can do that for somebody else i think 
ive performed a social function

it all started when kirk douglas walked out 
on a movie just before the cameras rolled now richard crenna finds 
himself in what could amount to a lifetime job as mentorfather 
figure to the invincible rambo 
i dont know why douglas left the film and its really not 
my business recalls crenna i was sent the script of first 
blood and called to the wilds of british columbia that was a very 
fortuitous call for me 
its been a real experience finding myself in this kind of 
film and if you will this kind of social phenomenon coming out of 
the rambo series 
richard crenna is no stranger to the show world at 61 he has 
clocked a halfcentury as a performer starting as a radio actor at 
11 
i was playing six or seven running roles at the same time 
once i did nine he recalled 
he is a veteran of films the sand pebbles body heat 
and television our miss brooks the real mccoys but 
nothing prepared him for the impact of the rambo movies 
starring sylvester stallone 
the audiences perception of you is related to what you are on 
the screen he observed ive been a chameleon in my career 
the audience never knows where theyre going to find me they lift 
a rock and theres crenna 
rambo has brought a new kind of recognition when youre 
walking down the streets of new york and youre in a series like 
the real mccoys people want to take you home and give you a 
barbecue when you play an authority figure as i did in the 
slatterys people series they say good afternoon mr crenna 
are you enjoying your trip 
now im getting hard hats 14 stories up yelling down hey 
rich whats happenin where did you leave rambo 
crennas role as col trautman has been both complementary and 
contrasting to john rambo the logical levelheaded commander and 
the impetuous fighting machine trautman usually shows up before or 
after the action but not in rambo iii 
in this film for the first time rambo and trautman are in 
action together crenna said i was forewarned by sly who 
called several months before we started and said you better get 
in shape crenna because im going to show you what its like to 
do what i have to do 
i said no youre kidding im too old to be running up and 
down mountains he said get in shape so for three months i got 
in shape and thank god i did because it was a very very 
difficult picture 
rambo iii filmed for 5 months in israel thailand and yuma 
ariz and the experience reinforced crennas awe for stallones 
dedication he gets up at 5 every morning to work out so he can 
stay in shape in first blood he worked in 40below weather 
wearing a tank top the temperature reached 130 in the negev on the 
last picture 
a conscientious actor crenna has tried to bring dimension in a 
film series not noted for character development i approach 
everything i do with enthusiasm and an attempt to bring honesty to 
the character i try to make trautman first and foremost a human 
being then i put on the green beret hopefully i put a human 
being under the beret 
viewing his 50 years as an actor crenna marveled i dont 
know how ive survived tenacity for one thing also the fact that 
ive never been a socalled movie star ive always considered 
myself a working actor thats what i do for a living 
thats enabled me to discover a lot of things about myself and 
my craft hopefully ill be able to continue until they put me in 
a chair take me out to the home and set me on the lawn

many children fall asleep on the floor in the living room with

angry frustrated and confused as a squalling baby 
eventually everyone learns how to get back to sleep at night 
without crying for help however ferber says that for about a

pat robertson suspended his 
republican presidential campaign today with a bow toward george 
bushs magnificent effort and said he would immediately return 
to the helm of his financiallytroubled religious broadcasting 
network 
two months after the super tuesday primaries ground to a halt 
robertsons invisible army of fervent supporters the former 
television evangelist formally took himself out of the gop 
presidential race 
today i suspend my candidacy for the republican nomination in 
1988 but i do not now nor will i ever suspend my advocacy of 
conservative and moral principles robertson said in front of his 
georgianstyle mansion here george bush has won the nomination 
i applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorse his candidacy 
robertson said he filed incorporation papers today for a new 
political action committee called americans for the republic a 
group that he said would be a rallying point for future political 
action 
but when pressed about whether he would run again in 1992 
robertson said that remains a moot question until the 1988 
election i hope mr bush is elected and then reelected again in 
1992 
robertson was accompanied by his wife dede his son tim and a 
few aides there were no other supporters present as robertson read 
his statement for reporters in stark comparison to the throngs 
that greeted robertson at campaign rallies early in the primary 
season 
robertson also said he would return to the christian 
broadcasting network he founded two decades ago 
at the urging of the board of directors of cbn i have agreed 
to resume the leadership of cbn tomorrow he said 
he would not discuss further layoffs at the network 
at the outset of the 1988 presidential race robertson was a 
wild card 
the republican establishment nervously eyed his evangelical 
followers and his hefty warchest and wondered what kind of a 
showing he might make since many robertson supporters were new to 
the political process his potential impact was difficult to gauge 
in the end robertson spent 22 million and gained only 46 
delegates to the republican national convention 
robertson set the stage for his departure last week by endorsing 
bush the republican nomineetobe who already has a mathematical 
lock on the nomination 
the high point of the robertson campaign came early on the 
feb 8 iowa caucuses where he beat out bush for second place 
behind kansas sen bob dole 
but in the next big battle the new hampshire primary 
robertson finished behind not only bush and dole but also behind 
new york rep jack kemp and former delaware gov pete du pont 
even then robertson gave every indication that he expected to 
make a comeback in the south with its march 8 megaprimary 
ladies and gentlemen he told his supporters after the 
disappointing showing in new hampshire tomorrow i go into the 
south and then we are going to be playing in my own backyard 
his backyard proved an unfriendly place in the southern 
primaries he finished no better than second place in texas and 
was third in his home state of virginia 
robertson continued to do well in the caucus states winning in 
hawaii nevada washington and alaska and doing well in minnesota 
and alaska 
but by midmarch robertson was no longer even competing in 
states with primaries he concentrated his scaleddown campaign on 
the caucuses started talking about 1992 and about making his mark 
at the republican national convention in new orleans this summer 
i am the true conservative candidate and i will bring that 
voice to the convention he said robertson said he hoped to 
shape the partys platform bringing it in line with his 
conservative views 
i want a platform like the 1984 platform for school prayer 
against abortion for family values he said 
the robertson campaign was not without its otherworldly moments 
on easter sunday robertson told a denver congregation his 
presidential bid was divinely inspired 
there is an enterprise the lord set me on a year or so ago 
running for president he said and it wasnt over yet he told 
the faithful 
out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a foundation 
for a great victory for this nation it may not be in 1988 but 
i am not going to quit that is his plan for me and for this 
nation robertson said 
other signposts on the robertson campaign trail 
he sued former rep paul mccloskey for libel when mccloskey 
said robertson used the influence of his father then a us 
senator from virginia to avoid combat in the korean war after 
some messy preliminaries robertson dropped the suit because it was 
to go to trial on super tuesday he was ordered to pay court costs 
he contended it was unfair and bigoted to describe him as a 
former television evangelist although that was how he became 
famous he said cable businessman or religious broadcaster would be 
more accurate 
his claim in a new hampshire debate that there were nuclear 
missiles in cuba aimed at this country robertson later said he had 
no firsthand information but insisted that nobody really 
knows the contention was denied by the white house the joint 
chiefs of staff and others 
his charges that planned parenthood founder margaret sanger 
wanted to sterilize blacks jews mental defectives and 
fundamentalist christians planned parenthood officials dismissed 
the allegation scholars who have studied sangers writings said 
there was no basis for the claim 
robertsons claim that the state department chose to ignore 
intelligence gathered by his christian broadcasting network people 
in beirut on the location of some american hostages the former cbn 
bureau chief in beirut later said he had no such information 
and statements that one can get aids through casual contact 
contradicting medical experts findings on the subject he also 
advocated shooting down airplanes suspected of carrying drugs into 
the country

virtually all children free of major medical or 
neurological problems have the ability to sleep well says dr 
richard ferber 
ferber a sleep expert at childrens hospital says that beyond 
the first six months of infancy almost every youngster is capable 
of going to bed at an appropriate hour falling asleep within 
minutes and staying asleep until a reasonable hour in the morning 
in his book solve your childs sleep problems simon amp 
schuster 795 ferber lists these additional facts and opinions 
about childrens sleep 
a newborn sleeps 16 or 17 hours a day while a 1yearold gets 
about 14 hours by age 3 until adolescence children gradually need 
less sleep a 12yearold should get about 10 hours needs vary 
from child to child 
the majority of children dont like to sleep in total darkness 
and there is no reason they should a night light or hall light 
helps children get their bearings if they wake up especially after 
a dream 
children should be put on a regular sleeping schedule dont 
let a 2 or 3yearold decide what time to go to bed 
once babies are about 3 months old they no longer need to be 
fed at bedtime and several times during the night if babies beyond 
this age awaken several times and must be fed to go back to sleep 
feeding is causing a sleep problem

in a babys first months of life the most common 
cause of crying is something called colic 
its cause is unclear but not its effects infants cry 
inconsolably often for hours on end 
sometimes their bellies are bulging and gassy but experts 
believe this is a result rather than a cause because colicky 
babies gulp air as they wail 
colic eventually goes away but in the meantime sleep expert 
dr richard ferber of childrens hospital says there are a few 
things parents can do 
sometimes walking the baby or rubbing his back will help if 
this fails simply leaving the child alone for a while may calm him 
down 
colicky infants may cry because they are overly sensitive to 
things happening around them or they are handled and stimulated too 
much 
if the baby is not easily comforted leave him alone in his crib 
for 15 to 30 minutes feeding or gentle softspoken consoling may 
then quiet him if it doesnt let him cry another 15 to 30 minutes 
ferber believes letting babies cry alone this way lets them 
release their builtup tensions

when the soviet union launched cosmos 1941 on 
april 27 it added to the productive satellites in orbit but also 
contributed 28 pieces to the junk that circles the earth 
every time a rocket slices through the atmosphere to the void 
beyond it adds to the litter some of the 7110 pieces in orbit 
are destined to travel around the globe for all time 
the united states and soviet union are the principal 
contributors of manmade objects in space which range in size from 
a screwdriver dropped by a spacewalking astronaut to the soviet 
mir space station 
somewhere out there too if they havent reentered the 
atmosphere and burned up are 10 or 12 screws about inch in 
diameter missing when the 1984 shuttle mission returned from 
repairing the solar max satellite 
another object that racked up millions of miles before it 
finally burned up was the thermal glove that floated out of gemini 
4 in 1965 while ed white had the hatch open for the first space 
walk by an american 
the us space command in colorado tracks all objects in space 
and all countries are obligated to inform one another about their 
launches 
six days after the cosmos 1941 launch in a weekly update the 
space command said 3246 of the 7110 pieces they were tracking by 
radar came from the soviet union the trackers said they detected 
28 new pieces and that eight others had decayed reentered 
the atmosphere for a net gain of 20 pieces 
the united states was responsible for 3148 pieces the european 
space agency 481 japan 82 and france 40 
the totals are nearly always three pieces of space debris for 
every working satellite more than half the debris comes from more 
than 90 satellites that have exploded unaccountably according to 
don kessler project scientist for debris studies at nasas johnson 
space center 
dangerous chunks of shrapnel whizzing through space at 22000 
mph also come from spent rocket bodies that shatter when residual 
fuels come in contact with each other a 3millimeter particle 
has as much kinetic energy as a bowling ball going 60 miles an hour 
and if it hit an electrical component it would probably cause that 
system to cease functioning kessler said 
space shuttle challenger returned from a mission in june 1983 
with a chip in the middle window on the right side of the cockpit 
chemical analysis showed the culprit was a flake of the paint used 
on rockets and payloads the window had to be replaced 
space station planners are faced with a considerable design 
problem because of the junk kessler said and have added 2000 
pounds of shielding to each of the six modules that will be 
occupied by astronauts 
the explosions of satellites or rockets often arent detected 
for a year or more after they occur he said a frenchmade ariane 
rocket blew up nine months after it deposited its cargo in space 
the fragments of that explosion probably caused by 
overpressurization of gases number 450 
after six us delta rocket second stages exploded the last in 
1981 three years after it was launched the manufacturer fixed 
the flaw that caused the blasts leaks in tanks holding fuels that 
burn when they combine

in a federal laboratory just up the road from 
the university of georgia sit dozens of pyrex beakers filled with 
moldy spoon size shredded wheat 
the mess in the beakers is the work of a selfdescribed 
simpleminded briton who finds in his fungi the stuff of an 
agricultural revolution natural compounds that can do the work of 
harmful chemicals 
hank cutler is a plant physiologist at the us department of 
agricultures richard b russell research center a highrise that 
borders the university campus but which few students ever visit 
to describe his work cutler likes to explain how discovery of 
penicillin from the penicillium mold turned medicine away from the 
use of dangerous metals for drugs and toward the use of natural 
antibiotics the same sort of thing is happening in agriculture 
perhaps now we need agricultural chemicals that are biodegradable 
and dont impact the environment 
cutler grows fungi often using as his medium spoon size 
shredded wheat with its little crosshatch pieces the cereal 
seems to work just fine for growing mold just add a little yeast 
and sugar 
he later filters the mold to fine compounds that might have some 
biological action of their own 
there may be 30 40 50 compounds in there and ive got to 
get out the one thats active thats the art i see something 
interesting in that gunk and i say how the hell am i going to 
get it out of there 
some of the compounds hes found include 
cyclopenin a chemical from penicillium mold that acts as a 
tranquilizer on baby chicks it contains the same structural 
elements as diazepam the drug sold as valium cutler said it 
also retards growth in some plants 
cyclopenol which kills the fungus that caused the great irish 
potato famine and still attacks crops 
cytochalasinh which controls flowering in certain plants 
cutlers latest discovery is a compound he grew from special 
wine grapes and dubbed cinereain 
its not terribly active but i bet that it will have 
significant pharmaceutical activity because structurally it 
resembles other compounds used in the pharmaceutical industry he 
said thats a hunch im probably dead wrong but i can 
guarantee you its got biological activity 
cutlers findings on cinereain will be published next month by 
the japanese journal agricultural and biological chemistry i 
like to publish on their turf because i then know that im highly 
competitive he said 
cutler whos made a career of studying fungi the last 20 years 
in georgia for the usda fears the united states is falling behind 
the far east in agricultural biochemistry american agriculture has 
been liberal with nonbiodegradable farm chemicals japan with its 
land constraints has turned to chemicals that dont harm the 
environment 
i believe very strongly that within the next five to seven 
years we will be importing japanese agricultural chemicals based on 
natural products he said and well be wringing our hands 
just like the automobile and saying gee whiz what happened

doxepin a drug used to treat depression may be 
the latest way to help people quit smoking a new study suggests 
smokers who took doxepin before and during abstinence showed 
less craving anxiety restlessness and difficulty in concentrating 
than those who took a placebo said researcher neil edwards of the 
university of tennessee 
after eight weeks nine of 12 doxepin users continued to abstain 
from smoking compared with only one of 13 on the placebo 
according to edwards who described the results at a recent 
american psychiatric association meeting 
he undertook the study after three psychiatric patients who took 
doxepin for depression mentioned they had quit smoking without 
withdrawal symptoms 
the crucial time for relapse extends for a year after quitting 
so studies will have to run at least that long to assess doxepins 
effectiveness edwards said other treatments also have been 
effective in the short term 
all the subjects had smoked at least five years and averaged 38 
cigarettes a day they were significant smokers edwards said 
both groups received individual counseling at weekly sessions 
he said 
edwards whose study was financed by the university said the 
biochemical mechanism for the effect of doxepin in exsmokers is 
not known drowsiness dry mouth and constipation are common side 
effects of the drug

a baby that wakes up and howls at night often is 
frustrated by an insolvable problem how to fall back to sleep 
dr richard ferber of the center for pediatric sleep disorders 
says virtually all healthy fullterm infants can sleep through the 
night by age 5 or 6 months babies who wake up and cry can usually 
develop good sleep habits in three or four nights or at worst a 
week or two 
the most widely recommended strategy for restoring peace is to 
let the child cry another is to check on the baby periodically but 
resist the urge to give it a bottle then theres the relatively 
new scheduled awakening method that involves rousing a child 
before it normally wakes you 
ferber recommends creating a sleep routine for your child that 
he can follow without you being there in the middle of the night 
start by putting the child to bed while he is awake in a 
reasonably dark quiet room without being rocked or given a back 
rub or pacifier 
if he cries wait five minutes then return and let him know he 
hasnt been abandoned but dont pick him up if he still cries 
wait 10 minutes and go in briefly the next time wait 15 minutes 
look in every 15 minutes until he falls asleep each night add 
five minutes to the waiting periods 
inability to get back to sleep is the most common cause of 
nighttime crying others include ear infections breathing 
difficulties toilet training a new bed starting day care or 
fighting between the parents

researchers say theyre encouraged by a new 
method of fighting one of the main obstacles facing leukemia 
victims who need bone marrow transplants a disease in which the 
transplanted marrow attacks the body 
graftversushost disease is the reverse of the reaction wherein 
the body rejects a transplanted organ dr roy wu of the national 
cancer institute says more recipients die from gvhd than from 
relapses of their leukemia 
in the new method johns hopkins oncology center researchers 
used a centrifuge to remove tlymphocytes immune system components 
that trigger rejection then implanted cellrich marrow necessary 
for the production of healthy blood and for successful grafts they 
also administered cyclosporin an antirejection drug that doctors 
had been using as part of leukemia treatment 
the 12month survival rate for patients treated with cyclosporin 
is only about 35 percent dr albert donnenberg of johns hopkins 
says 50 percent of patients receiving the new treatment survived 
the year patients who began the new treatment while in remission 
for leukemia had a 63 percent survival rate compared with 39 
percent for patients who were in early relapse 
donnenberg says it is too early to claim success because the 
center has not done a controlled study in which two groups are 
treated and studied

a study of more than 15000 american soldiers 
indicates that vietnam veterans were almost twice as likely to 
report medical problems as those who served elsewhere and suggests 
the difference may be stressrelated 
vietnam veterans also showed more anxiety and depression in a 
battery of psychological tests says the vietnam experience 
study stress can produce anxiety depression and a variety of 
somatic physical symptoms 
the centers for disease control conducted phone interviews with 
7924 gis who served in vietnam in 19651971 and 7364 who served 
elsewhere extensive physicals were given to a subsample of 2490 
vietnam veterans and 1972 others 
the study found no physical indications of exposure to agent 
orange and said perceived exposure to herbicides is linked with 
psychological problems and with reported health problems that did 
not show up in physical exams 
vietnam veterans were almost twice as likely 196 percent to 
111 percent to report health problems yet doctors who did not 
know the military history of the two groups examined them and could 
detect few medical differences 
the vietnam veterans have a higher incidence of alcohol abuse 
anxiety and depression greater hearing loss and a measurably lower 
sperm count fifteen percent suffered symptoms of combatrelated 
post traumatic stress disorder 
the study was ordered by congress as part of veterans benefit 
bills passed in 1979 and 1981

scientists plan to entomb a 
3000yearold mummy dubbed lady x to test a hermetically sealed 
display case designed to prevent the decay of egypts mummies and 
other antiquities 
the glasswalled cases will be filled with inert nitrogen gas 
silica gel to keep relative humidity at 30 percent to 40 percent 
and a special powder to destroy any oxygen temperatures will be 
kept at 68 to 72 degrees fahrenheit 
lady x believed to have been a commoner was found near luxor 
in the 1960s and was the first mummy sent out of egypt since the 
remains of pharaoh ramses ii were taken to paris in 1976 for 
radiation treatment to halt fungal decay 
she will rest for one to three months in the new display case as

heart transplant recipients need help learning 
to get the most out of life say researchers who found that more 
than half the patients in a new study suffered mood disturbances 
and many faced family problems 
side effects of postsurgical medication including headache 
burning pains and reduced sexual performance cause some of the 
problems according to peter shapiro and donald kornfeld of 
columbia universitys college of physicians and surgeons in new 
york the two studied 73 heart recipients 
one study group of 30 patients was interviewed up to a year 
after surgery another group of 43 were studied up to six years 
after the transplant 
thirtyseven patients had mood disturbances such as 
demoralization and difficulty adjusting to posttransplant life 
four cases suffered major depression fifteen had mood swings 
irritability and argumentativeness symptoms began the first few 
weeks after surgery and receded as dosages of antirejection drugs 
were tapered off 
twelve patients had family or marital troubles such as children 
running away from home or picking fights with their parents the 
problem was especially common with teenage sons who resented the 
fathers trying to reassert a role of disciplinarian after the 
disabling heart condition was over 
sixteen patients complained of decreased memory

the federal government after spending 23931 
million trying to develop a completely artificial human heart is 
turning its attention to smaller pumps that can assist rather than 
replace a failing heart 
there are still a lot of problems that cannot soon be solved 
with a total heart replacement device according to dr claude 
lenfant director of the national heart lung and blood institute 
every attempt at replacing human hearts has resulted in a patient 
dying of either infection or stroke caused by blood clots that 
develop within the mechanical heart 
the national institutes of health now will support only four 
grants for development of a selfcontained longterm single 
ventricular device which would be inserted into the left 
ventricle of the heart the chamber that endures most of the work 
stress in the fourchambered human heart 
the grants will go to thermedics inc of woburn mass abiomed

getting and holding a job in the 1990s is 
going to be easier than it was this decade as the population ages 
and the labor force grows more slowly 
but getting the good jobs in the fastestgrowing fields such as 
health services data processing and management will require more 
education training and a willingness to develop new skills 
periodically according to experts 
the growth will be predominantly among those occupations 
generally requiring postsecondary education says janet l 
norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics the 
greatest decline will be in those jobs generally requiring less 
than a high school education 
about 38 percent of the 20 million new jobs that the american 
economy is expected to create between now and the year 2000 will 
require at least one year of college or more according to 
government projections 
the greatest demand will be for skilled technicians and service 
workers particularly in the computer and medical fields followed 
by managers and sales workers in the skyrocketing number of small 
businesses together they will account for half of the new jobs by 
the end of the century 
not needed are more farmers and private household forestry and 
fishing workers employment in all of those fields is expected to 
decline from its current level by 3 percent to 6 percent over the 
next 12 years 
and for other lessskilled occupations such as manual laborers 
operators or assembly line workers job growth is projected to 
climb only a total of 25 percent by 2000 in contrast to an 18 
percent projected employment growth in the economy as a whole 
it is going to be a lot rougher than it used to be for people 
without a high school education says richard belous a labor 
market economist for the conference board a business research 
group financed largely by fortune 500 companies 
there has always been a premium on education but that premium 
is increasing belous said even traditional industries for 
bluecollar workers such as mining and construction are becoming 
more skillbased requiring people who can deal with 
numericallycontrolled equipment computers and blueprints 
because of the increasing complexity of hospital care the 
biggest demand for any single occupation will be registered nurses 
whose average pay now ranges between 20000 and 27000 a year 
the bureau of labor statistics projects employment of nurses 
will grow 44 percent or by 612000 between now and 2000 but 
cautions that some career paths will be restricted to those with 
bachelors degrees in the field 
a dramatic increase in the need for workers exists in all of the 
health fields among them job growth is expected to rise 30 
percent for dentists 63 percent for dental hygienists 75 percent 
for medical record technicians 38 percent for physicians 65 
percent for radiologic tecnologists and 87 percent for physical 
therapists 
job growth in the relatively young field of physicians 
assistants now with only 26000 people in it is expected to climb 
57 percent over the next decade 
and the demand for legal assistants will double reflecting what 
belous sees as an increasing trend among professionals in all 
occupations to turn more of their workload over to 
paraprofessionals as the demand for their services increases 
relatively speaking these jobs provide good salaries job 
mobility and careers for people who lack the resources or 
inclination to attend college for four years he said 
even the prestigious law and accounting firms are under coming 
under such intense cost pressures from their clients that they are 
turning more of the routine work that used to be done by senior 
partners over to paralegals and paraaccountants belous said 
the model were gravitating towards is the dentists office where 
the majority of the patients time is spent with the hygienist 
for college graduates the biggest job growth will occur among 
physicians an increase of 188000 by the year 2000 electrical and 
electronics engineers up 192000 and lawyers up 191000 
the marketing advertising and public relations fields also will 
see a job growth of about 32 percent according to the government 
as domestic and foreign competiton among buinesses intensifies 
and employment of social workers is expected to increase by 33 
percent in response to the needs of a growing and aging population 
the computer fields will be the other biggest area of growth 
with the demand for programmers expected to rise 70 percent or by 
335000 over the next 12 years and for systems analysts by 75 
percent of 251000 
however as with most of the new jobs the prospects for winning 
employment will be the best for programmers and systems analysts 
with college educations 
applicants with less than a bachelors degress and no 
experience are likely to face strong competition the bureau of 
labor statistics says 
familiarity with and knowledge about computers is going to be 
more of a prerequisite for jobs in most other fields as well says 
belous 
everyone is going to have to become more comfortable with 
computers he says even though they are becoming more 
friendly and because the days of wombtotomb in one corporation 
are over the best advice i have is to always have a current resume 
on a floppy disk its going to be a much more mobile job

college graduates this year are finding 
jobs more easily than the class of 87 but often with companies 
that wouldnt have recruited on campus in the past according to 
placement experts 
job candidates also are facing more tests for drug use and 
honesty 
we see a very bright outlook for this years graduates said 
alan e yost assistant executive director of the bethlehembased 
college placement council we are in an expanding economy 
pennsylvania state university students for example had nearly 
26000 oncampus interviews this year with business industry and 
government representatives up from 23325 last year said ralph 
deshong associate director of career development and placement 
temple university had 10 career days on campus when employers 
could meet and interview students said neil gutman director of 
career development in past years it had just six he said 
the most significant factor for us has been the considerable 
increase in less wellknown employers gutman said 
pizza companies a dairy and delicatessen association and 
discount building supply companies are among the employers that 
have come to look for management prospects gutman said 
these are employers that wouldnt have been here a few years 
ago he said 
the trend in part reflects changes in major corporations that 
today employ service or consulting firms for work once performed 
inhouse yost said theyre bringing fewer people in through the 
broad front door he said 
last falls stock market chill appears to have had little effect 
on this springs job prospects 
it did not go unnoticed we had some students who were 
concerned about it deshong said but we cant say that it has 
had an impact nor are we hearing students say that offers have 
stopped 
in its latest survey of salary offers the college placement 
council reported employers are offering more money to graduates in 
most disciplines 
offers to electrical engineering graduates as of march averaged 
2410 monthly a 14 percent increase since last july accounting 
1975 up 9 percent and marketing and distribution 1742 up 
27 percent 
social workers were being offered an average of 1420 up 9 
percent communications workers 1619 up 71 percent and 
management consultants 2228 up 33 percent 
offers were lower for graduates in only a few academic 
disciplines such as economics 1817 monthly down 78 percent 
from last july chemistry 2059 down 34 percent and aerospace 
and aeronautical engineering 2322 down 09 percent 
offers as financial analysts averaged 1940 down 124 percent 
banking 1687 down 107 percent and transportation and 
distribution 1824 down 27 percent 
but to start earning a paycheck graduates often must undergo 
more rigorous screening than their predecessors 
in a november 1986 survey of 497 employers the council found 
282 percent required tests for drug or alcohol abuse the council 
estimates nearly 60 percent of all employers now use such tests 
yost said 
the main reasons cited for drug screening in 1986 were safety 
and security he said 
students have adjusted fairly well to that said deshong 
its obviously a concern to business industry and government 
employers are also checking other aspects of employees 
backgrounds more thoroughly 
they seem to be backing off from the liedetector test but 
theres a pickup in the tests for honesty yost said adding that 
credentials get a more thorough review today as well 
the employers are getting a lot more cautious about bringing 
people aboard yost said given the litigiousness of society 
and what a contract implies they want to be awfully sure going 
in 
where students went to college has limited bearing on their 
careers 
a prestigious degree may help a student get the first job but 
not the second one yost said 
you cant go into your job and base your performance on your 
undergraduate grade point average deshong said sooner or 
later its going to come down to productivity

a national shortage of nurses has brought out the imagination in 
hospital and state recruiters who are trying enticements from 
higher salaries to recruitment dinners from pay bonuses for new 
nurses to highway billboard advertising 
some 300000 nursing jobs are unfilled nationwide with hospital 
nursing vacancies nearing 20 percent according to the american 
nurses association 
the federal bureau of labor statistics says the biggest demand 
for any single occupation between now and the end of the century 
will be registered nurses whose average pay now ranges between 
20000 and 27000 a year the agency projects the employment of 
nurses will grow 44 percent or by 612000 between now and 2000 but 
cautions that some career paths will be restricted to those with 
bachelors degrees in the field 
while some hospitals have had to close wards because of the 
shortage others are coming up with at least temporary solutions 
thousands of foreign nurses have been recruited from overseas in 
an effort to ease the shortage in the united states although that 
program has run into some problems with immigration officials 
regarding temporary visas 
in st joseph mo the actor who plays the grandfatherly dr 
auschlander in televisions st elsewhere joined a 
recruiting drive by heartland hospital east norman loyd stars in a 
10minute video to be distributed nationwide in heartlands search 
for nursing personnel having him in it will be an 
attentiongetter something we hope will catch the eye of nurses 
who might be looking for a position said debi yancer associate 
director of patient care services 
 
the video will be shown at career days placement fairs and at 
recruitment dinners that have been spurred by the nationwide 
shortage of nurses 
a plan to train welfare recipients to be registered nurses has 
gotten the goahead from the administration of wisconsin gov tommy 
g thompson despite criticism from some nurses 
 
the proposal drew criticism from representatives of the nursing 
profession and lawmakers who called it demeaning because it seemed 
to ignore the education skills and dedication needed to become a 
nurse 
the plan is to be implemented through the wisconsin employment 
and training program commonly called workfare 
were about 1000 nurses short in this state weve got 80000 
to 90000 people on welfare said state sen joseph strohl 
weve got to have 1 percent that have the necessary ingredients 
to become a nurse under the plan counties that administer job 
counseling will encourage welfare recipients to enter nursing 
programs at vocational schools the state will pick up the cost of 
tuition and day care strohl said 
another wisconsin plan to ease the nursing shortage involved 
forgiving some student loans of nurses who go to work in hospitals 
or nursing homes 
in stafford conn johnson memorial hospital leased a billboard 
overlooking a part of an interstate highway advertising 
attention healthcare professionals if you worked at johnson 
memorial hospital you would be home by now 
some hospitals have begun a nursesforhire program for 
nurses who travel the country working a few months at one hospital 
before moving on to another 
in cincinnati the good samaritan hospital school of nursing is 
offering a registered nurse refresher course for those who have 
been out of practice for five or more years 
nurses who left the profession to have families are often 
hesitant to come back becuse they fear not understanding new 
procedures says carol perlman school of nursing assistant 
director of program development the course will help nurses gain 
confidence in dealing with new technology offer an opportunity to 
gradually get back into nursing and get reacquainted with their 
skills and knowledge of patient care 
the american association of criticalcare nurses aacn which 
says 82 percent of the nations hospitals report a shortage of 
critical care nurses has published a recruitment booklet a poster 
and two videos in an attempt to lure nurses into the career 
critical care nurses provide a vital role in the quality of 
hospital health care from patient treatment rehabilitation and 
recovery to family support and counseling says jeanette 
hartshorn president of aacn and a registered nurse 
it is estimated that by the year 2000 she says hospitals 
will only care for the most seriouslyill patients the number of 
critical care beds has continued to rise but the demand for 
speciallyeducated and technologically sophisticated nurses has not 
been able to meet the demand and the demand continues to 
increase 
a critically ill patient is defined by aacn as one with real or 
potential lifethreatening health problems

an unusual recruiting effort proved that 
a job seeker can make progress while stuck in a traffic jam 
johnson memorial hospital in stafford earlier this year leased a 
billboard overlooking a busy section of interstate 91 in hartford 
for two months advertising openings on its nursing staff 
the hospital was feeling the impact of the nationwide nursing 
shortage and had been forced to turn patients away or refer them 
to other hospitals officials said 
the billboard read attention healthcare professionals if 
you worked at johnson memorial hospital you would be home by now 
stephen e torla vice president of human resources at johnson 
memorial said the billboard resulted in five vacancies being 
filled and inquiries about employment were received from as far 
away as missouri and new jersey 
the billboard was good as far as employee moral good as a 
recruitment tool and good exposure torla said adding that 
there are still some nursing vacancies at the hospital 
elizabeth a nelson vice president of financing at johnson 
memorial said the hospital is considering renewing the billboards 
lease to attract other hardtofind employees such as laboratory 
technicians respiratory therapists and operating room technicians 
judith insinga planning analyst for gov william a oneills 
task force on the nursing shortage said the connecticut hospital 
association reported last december that 118 percent of the jobs 
for registered nurses in the state are now vacant thats nearly 
1000 jobs insinga said 
lynn steck national creative director for patrick media group 
which designed the billboard for johnson memorial said other 
hospitals are leasing billboard space to draw attention to the 
healthcare services they offer 
patrick media group a billboard advertising company based in 
scranton pa with offices in hartford projects that by the end 
of 1988 hospitals are projected to rank 11th among the companys 
top 25 advertisers listed according to dollar expenditure she said 
outdoor ads are a 24houraday medium which allow the 
audience to be moving its something you cant turn off steck 
said 
meanwhile johnson memorial and other connecticut hospitals are 
using other lures to get and keep nurses 
johnson memorial offers to pay nurses doubletime on weekends or 
pay for 40 hours if they agree to work four ninehour shifts 
also the hospital will pay the tuition of an employee who has 
worked for a year or more who wishes to train as a nurses 
assistant or a licensed practical nurse

as computer data bases cassettes and compact 
discs join newspapers magazines and books the united states is 
confronting a shortage of public librarians to help sort the flood 
of information a large number of librarians will be retiring in 
the next five to 10 years and there arent the numbers coming in to 
replace them said margaret myers a personnel expert with the 
american library association 
 
she said library schools had 3538 graduates in 1986 fewer than 
half the 8091 degrees in 1979 
 
the shortfall comes as the public needs librarians trained to 
help make sense of the new books data bases videocassettes 
specialist magazines and countless other media that debut daily 
ms myers said recently 
childrens librarians school media specialists catalogers and 
minority service personnel are in particularly short supply 
experts say some openings go unfilled others are staffed by less 
qualified workers 
in some geographic areas its a crisis new york boston the 
east coast said ala president margaret chisholm theres such 
a shortage that it is really affecting services 
 
among the causes cited for the shortage are new corporate 
opportunities an overall increase in the number of public library 
jobs and low pay for librarians 
 
average starting salaries for new york city librarians with 
masters degrees in library science are 22500 said library 
spokeswoman lauren moye a national survey of 1986 library school 
masters graduates indicated starting salaries averaged 20874 
school librarians averaged 28390 last year reference workers 
in public and academic libraries were paid an average 23552 in 
1986 and staff in special libraries including corporations 
averaged 28943 in 1985 according to studies 
 
librarians in the west and southwest tend to make higher 
salaries said ms myers lowest salaries are in the 
southeast 
once one of the few professions open to women public and school 
library careers are now just one of many options 
 
libraries and nursing cannot compete with law and banking 
said ed szynaka library director in suburban pasadena you could 
start with a five figure salary in law that could be as high as 
you would ever get in a library career 
 
those who stick with library training are finding better pay 
working in corporate libraries and data bases rather than public 
libraries the corporate openings listed at ala meetings outstrip 
the number of interviewees said myers 
 
a california library association report predicts 1988 will bring 
364 public academic and specialized librarian openings 256 of 
them in public libraries next year 446 openings are expected 
statewide 
while the survey projected 60 percent of the openings will be in 
public libraries only 28 percent of the 162 library school 
students responding to the survey want public library work 
thirtyfive percent prefer academic libraries and 26 percent 
special libraries 
salaries are better in the private sector than in the public 
sector said mary sue farrell executive director of the state 
library association salaries are better at gte or ibm than 
working for the city of san francisco 
 
along with the need for childrens librarians the survey also 
pinpointed an underrepresentation of minorities in the profession 
as compared with the population of california especially among 
hispanics and blacks 
with shortages of both childrens and school librarians experts 
are worried that young people may not gain the skills needed to 
sort information gained from reading books or magazines typing 
queries on a computer terminal using a microfiche reader or 
viewing from a compact disc if you have a school of 3000 kids 
and you dont have a librarian there thats a problem said 
bonnie obrian the los angeles school library 
supervisor almost every job people are going into has to do 
with information the only place they can learn that is in the 
school library media center

technology is changing the image of the office secretary 
a recent survey of 500 american corporations found that 61 
percent of the employers hire secretaries with word processing 
skills and 57 percent expect secretaries to use personal computers 
within two years 
the survey was conducted by indianapolisbased itt educational 
services inc an itt corp subsidiary and a private trainer of 
professional secretaries 
filing and dictation are no longer considered primary 
secretarial skill requirements a secretary in todays workplace 
needs to be proficient in world processing reprographics 
communication distribution and electronic mail said rene 
champagne president of itt educational services 
those secretaries who possess the skills needed to keep up 
with new technologies are becoming invaluable to their employer 
employers are perceiving secretaries in a new light says 
eleanor p vreeland president of the katharine gibbs school which 
conducted a survey of fortune 500 and other companies the 
presence of automation in every office enables secretaries to 
devote more time to administrative responsibilities thus offering 
companies a more productive employee 
katharine gibbs school inc is a network of 11 private business 
secretarial schools in the northeast 
in the gibbs survey 51 percent of the respondents acknowledged 
a significant increase in the secretarys level of administrative 
responsibility 48 percent saw the need for computer literacy as 
another major change 
ninetythree percent of the companies surveyed by the 
secretarial school agreed that the role of the secretary is 
different than it was five years ago seventyfive percent said 
secretaries must have knowledge of word processing 
the us bureau of labor statistics estimates that 300000 
secretarial positions will become available through the 1980s and 
80000 of these will go unfilled because of a lack of unqualified 
secretaries 
good secretaries are hard to find for a number of reasons 
miss vreeland said the baby bust has resulted in fewer people in 
the work force there are more career options open to women and 
the rapid growth of small to midsized businesses has caused 
fierce competition for secretaries between companies especially in 
the northeast 
the bureau of labor statistics projects a 96 percent increase 
in secretarial jobs from 1984 to 1995 despite the spread of office 
automation 
jobs for secretaries stenographers and typists increased by an 
average of 33 percent a year between 1982 and 1987 below the rate 
for total employment

jobseekers with a disability probably shouldnt mention it on 
their resume waiting instead until they are invited for an 
interview says a university of michigan administrator 
once hired disabled people have proven themselves to be 
important members of the work force in terms of both numbers and 
achievement notes darlys vander beek director of disabled student 
services at the ann arbor mich institution 
vander beek says about 14 percent of the labor force has some 
kind of disability 20 percent if substance abusers are included 
one of the most frequent questions asked by disabled persons is 
whether to list a disability on a resume she says adding that 
some say it is only fair to employers while others believe it may 
eliminate the applicant from consideration 
i would say to not put it on a resume unless you are applying 
to a place where your disability would be a definite asset or 
where youll be working with a lot of disabled people vander 
beek suggests 
otherwise dont bring it up until you have been invited for 
an interview 
vander beek says that legally potential employers cannot ask 
about a disability unless they can prove job performance would be 
affected studies show however that those who openly discuss the 
matter with interviewers tend to be more successful in their 
jobseeking she adds 
but if a disability is not visible and wont affect the job 
dont bring it up because old stereotypes still linger she says

public school teachers now earn 28031 on 
average and in 10 states the typical teacher earns more than 
30000 a year the national education association reports 
the average classroom teacher with 15 years of experience got 
a 56 percent pay raise last year that boosted her or his salary by 
1477 from the 198687 level of 26534 
the union did not estimate how much salaries will rise this 
fall but if teachers get another 56 percent increase they will 
be earning 29600 on average for the 198889 school year 
teacher salaries have risen sharply in the 1980s amid widespread 
concern about lagging standards in the classroom and waning 
interest among college students in entering the profession 
recently however with starting salaries topping 20000 in some 
places interest in teaching has picked up 
secretary of education william j bennett in a critique on the 
impact of school reforms said teacher salaries have risen 20 
percent after adjusting for inflation since 198081 
but the nea said that over the past decade including the steep 
inflation years of the late 1970s teacher salaries are up only 73 
percent after inflation 
the union said there were 2275209 classroom teachers in the 
public schools this year 25251 more than in 198687 
the entire instructional staff including principals 
supervisors and specialists numbered 2589148 that was up by 
30190 or 12 percent the average salary for all instructors was 
29203 up 53 percent from 27722 last year 
most teachers work on nine or 10month contracts 
eighteen states and the district of columbia pay teachers more 
than the national average 32 states pay less 
nea researchers said the 28031 figure is an estimate based on 
salary data compiled from all 50 states it was up by 1477 or 
56 percent from the unions revised average salary figure of 
26534 for the 198687 year 
although only an estimate the nea salary figure is widely 
cited including by the us department of education as the most 
accurate indicator of how much the nations nearly 23 million 
classroom teachers in the public schools are earning it includes 
american federation of teachers contracts

unemployment fell in april to 54 percent the 
lowest it has been since 1974 with exportled hiring on factory 
assembly lines in the industrial heartland leading the latest spurt 
of new jobs the government said 
the number of americans at work rose by 606000 in april while 
those listed as unemployed fell by 191000 to 66 million dropping 
joblessness 02 percentage points from marchs rate of 56 percent 
the labor department said 
the rate was the lowest since june 1974 when it also stood at 
54 percent but at time when the nation was well into a steep 
recesssion in contrast to the current economic expansion 
the labor department said in its report on the job market that 
the average hourly wage nationwide in april rose to 922 a nickel 
over march for an average annual increase of 56 percent that is 
twice the 28 percent average increase in hourly wages for all of 
1987 
growth in new factory jobs which had been sluggish the previous 
three months after rising dramatically in 1987 accounted for more 
than onefourth of the 175000 increase in employers payrolls in 
april 
leading the surge were exportrelated industries such as 
machinery and fabricated metal products but production jobs in the 
us auto industry also climbed by 10000 reversing widescale 
layoffs in january and february 
the jobless rate for adult men fell 03 percent points to 46 
percent in april for women it remained unchanged at 48 percent 
hospital and business services and retail outlets such as stores 
and restaurants which had been the hottest areas of job growth the 
past year showed a total payroll gain of just 71000 in april 
the labor department said nearly all of the improvement in the 
unemployment figures was among people who had been laid off from 
their last jobs as opposed to those who had quit or were seeking 
employment for the first time 
the number of unemployed job losers declined to slightly less 
than 3 million and their proportion of the total jobless was at its 
lowest point this decade 44 percent said janet l norwood the 
commissioner of labor statistics 
growth in voluntary parttime jobs accounted for twothirds of 
the increase in the number of working americans in april 
we often fall into the trap of reacting negatively to any job 
expansion that is not full time ms norwood told the 
congressional joint economic committee but some one out of every 
eight workers 15 million in all do not want fulltime jobs 
the number of people working parttime because they could not 
find fulltime work actually fell by 150000 in april to 52 
million still a level of concern ms norwood said

a liberal arts college degree often has meant prestige and 
pride but little pay in the real world but there are some 
indications that business is acknowledging that there is life after 
liberal arts training 
a liberally educated person is still the type of individual 
needed at the highest level of corporate life says robert 
callander president of chemical bank and a dartmouth college 
graduate 
the technical skills are built upon this base it is this 
peculiar mix of sciences mathematics history and english that 
produces a mind capable in later life of bringing mature judgment 
to complex and sometimes great issues he says 
many employers look for graduates with the writing and 
analytical skills and broadbased education that liberal arts 
provide says alan p goodman career services director at the 
catholic university of america in washington dc 
he says jobseekers should major in a liberal arts field and 
take electives such as economics management or computer sciences 
combine their studies with experience in student government and 
work as a college student in a business environment 
with this concept in mind many colleges are seeking ways of 
providing a broadbased education while preparing students for a 
career 
many offer internships and cooperative education programs that 
provide students with work experience outside the classroom 
concordia college in moorhead minn offers a combination of a 
liberal arts curriculum and vocational preparation learning and 
earning students at concordia are assigned to a faculty adviser 
for involvement in cooperative education programs internships or 
parttime work related to their major course of study 
buena vista college in storm lake iowa has a program called 
second curriculum in which students meet with a career adviser 
to decide which extracurricular activities stress jobrelated and 
personal development skills for example a student who plans to be 
a lawyer found that involvement in the student activities board 
improved assertiveness and decisionmaking skills 
marymount manhattan college in new york city offers a seminar 
called women in management which is offered for college credit to 
honors students it features professional women from bankers to 
ballet dancers as guest lecturers speaking about their work 
we didnt want to be only a careeroriented school says lou 
stanek program director we are convinced that the liberal arts 
is the best training for leaders 
too many students see college simply as a ticket to getting a 
job when they graduate says al splete president of the council 
of independent colleges a service organization for small liberal 
arts colleges 
liberal arts graduates are problemsolvers and will be 
successful because they have perception and can change as needed

summertime the song says and the livin is easy 
but making a living may be something else at least for students 
who often work long hours for minimum wages during their summer 
break 
some schools are trying to make it a little easier by helping 
students find work that pays more than undergraduates usually earn 
at the university of rochester rochester ny for example a 
summerreach jobs program offers employers subsidies from donors 
for hiring students 
the university pays 36 percent of the student earnings with 
money raised from donors who see their contribution creating jobs 
at salaries that help offset high educational costs 
people and foundations like to contribute to education but 
especially to students who want to help themselves says james 
scannell university of rochester vice president for enrollments 
placement and alumni affairs its been relatively easy to raise 
money for this program 
the program has placed nearly 100 students to date in job areas 
such as community planning engineering sales public relations 
marketing and banking 
average summer earnings are estimated at 2700 
similar programs are offered at duke university and cornell 
university among others

more than half of all american families have two wage earners 
according to labor department figures and 67 percent have children 
under the age of 14 
in many cases this has presented a difficult problem in 
balancing career and family 
just ask danielle kennedy 
i learned many valuable lessons about delegating 
responsibilty communication and negotiation right from my own 
living room she says 
kennedy 43 began her first fulltime career in real estate 
sales when she was pregnant with her fifth child she is now a 
motivational lecturer author of two books on selling and the 
mother of eight 
many women she says look for a full or parttime career for 
the added sense of personal accomplishment that working can 
provide along with a flexibility in hours that allows for 
involvement in family affairs and child raising many quickly 
discover however that it takes quite a balancing act to be 
successful at both she says 
for those who seek to balance these two worlds she advises 
working parents need to give equal priority to important 
family and business commitments establish a solid dividing line 
between the time dedicated to work and home 
form welldefined goals and make a commitment to achieving 
them include the family in the process of goalsetting the most 
important motivating factors in my work arent me goals they are 
we goals she says 
she once promised ski lessons to her children if she reached a 
certain sales quota we put up a ski poster as a reminder of what 
we were all working toward and everyone pitched in with laundry 
cooking and cleaning up after themselves 
when a family achieves we goals the message kids get is 
that the big bad world isnt so bad at all she says its a 
big exciting hopeful world 
sales appears to be a career area that suits many working 
parents as it often offers flexible hours 
some 90 percent of direct sales consultants are women and more 
than 80 percent work at it part time according to the direct 
selling association washington dc turnover can be frequent but 
many have made direct sales a longterm career 
mitch allphin for example is a princess house home decorator 
consultant who earns 250 to 400 for 12to18hour weeks 
i never considered myself a good salesperson she says 
but i love showing off the crystal and demonstrating how to use 
it for decorating 
she schedules her demonstrations at night three or four 
evenings a week when her husband cares for the three children 
he calls it his quality time with them she says 
she takes her business with her when she travels there are no 
assigned territories so its easy to keep the business going as we 
vacation she says

salary was not the most influential factor in making a career 
choice among business administration students according to a 
carnegie mellon university survey 
the pittsburgh school study found career path and advancement 
were more important than salary with 55 percent of last years 
graduating mba class not accepting the highest paying job offered 
one student eventually chose a job that paid 20000 a year less 
than one he was offered other salary differentials were about 
5000 
after career path and advancement the work itself and use of 
skills was considered most important followed by geography the 
comfort factor and people salary ranked ninth 
the study was conducted by ed mosier director of carnegie 
mellons career opportunities center among some 100 business 
school graduates who received two or more job offers 
mosier said that being wined and dined by prospective 
employers did not greatly influence final decisions

nothing makes a worse impression on prospective employers than 
an applicant who arrives late for a job interview and the key to 
success in the facetoface meeting is projecting a natural and 
confident manner 
so says a job placement executive for an indianapolisbased 
technical school network 
our employers judge job candidates on first impressions 
taking particular note of enthusiasm interest and appearance 
according to connie welborn national placement director for itt 
educational services inc 
in addition to tardiness she advises there are several other 
common interview blunders that should be avoided including 
dressing inappropriately asking too many questions criticizing 
former employers and not doing your homework 
since employers get their first impression from the applicants 
appearance the safest choice of what to wear is a conservative 
suit or dress in navy gray or tan with equally businesslike 
accessories 
as for asking questions welborn suggests a few will demonstrate 
your enthusiasm but they should be limited to three or four about 
the company and the job opening 
criticism and gossip about former employers will brand the 
applicant as a complainer she advises while on the other hand the 
job interviewer might be impressed by applicants who have bothered 
to familiarize themselves with the companys most recent 
developments 
other common mistakes include 
discussing personal and financial problems the interviewer 
wants to hear about your training and experience not your 
financial woes keep your personal life to yourself 
not knowing your strengths be prepared to speak about 
yourself and why you are suited to the job opening 
lack of training and education you shouldnt waste 
someones time if you know that your education does not meet the 
minimum requirements remember if you lack the skills its never 
too late to enroll in a training program 
not following up if you are not offered the job on the 
spot be sure to send a brief note to thank the interviewer for his 
time it is also a great way to express your interest 
irvin marek director of the career planning and placement 
office at chicagos loyola university has similar suggestions for 
jobseekers adding 
dont slouch fidget chew gum or smoke be positive be 
courteous be yourself 
successful research successful practice successful questions 
lead to success look forward to the job interview as an 
opportunity to sell yourself to the organization you want to join 
one of the more important elements in a job interview may be 
your voice says a professional voice consultant 
the trick is to be able to convey a strong sense of 
confidence even if you feel like jelly inside says william 
rush who is also an adviser to the halls voice improvement program 
some of his tips for job interviewing 
recognize that you will be nervous consciously slow down your 
inner tempo take a few deep breaths to make it easier for you to 
speak 
remember to enunciate consonant sounds and avoid mumbling 
watch your posture keep your shoulders back and spine 
straight 
pause briefly after each important thought or word to add 
emphasis 
try to anticipate the questions your interviewer might ask 
you will convey your messages more confidently when those topics do 
come up

many young people make the mistake of applying for jobs before 
they know what they really want to do according to a career 
planning consultant at a california college 
salary alone should not determine the choice of a career says 
lane von herzen director of career planning at scripps college in 
claremont calif 
be wary of choosing a career or a particular entrylevel job 
offer solely because of its comparative monetary reward von 
herzen cautions the extra money wont be rewarding in the long 
run if thats not the direction in which you really want to go 
a career that offers less money at least in the beginning 
may turn out to be more enriching for you in the fundamental sense 
of career satisfaction 
another pressure to be resisted he adds is the suggestion from 
parents or peers that a career should be chosen because its 
prestigious 
remember that its you not your parents or peers who is 
going to be devoting your life to this pursuit he notes 
youll be more fulfilled and probably more successful if you 
make a choice based on your own interests goals and values 
von herzen recommends that students engage in careerresearch 
interviewing long before they enter the job market 
by talking to people in their intended field he advises career 
seekers can find out what the greatest satisfactions and drawbacks 
are in that particular career the present and anticipated 
opportunities and what kind of person it takes to be successful 
try to get a gut feeling of what its like to earn your living 
in this way he adds if at all possible get yourself an 
internship so you can experience that feeling first hand 
in preparing resumes he says jobseekers should be specific 
and instead of saying youve developed coordination skills tell 
what youve coordinated or instead of saying youve mastered 
timemanagement skills say you earned 20 percent of your college 
tuition while working two summer jobs

women executives climbing the corporate ladder of american 
business are finding that success in their careers literally can be 
a pain in the neck and upper back according to a physical 
therapist 
in shouldering new responsibilities the executives often work 
under sedentary stress sitting for hours in a fixed position 
behind a desk writing reports dictating letters and conducting 
meetings or interviewing job applicants 
caught up in their work most women executives simply ignore 
upper back pain and steam full speed ahead says margaret seiler 
supervising physical therapist at the back pain clinic for 
outpatients at crozerchester medical center in chester pa 
but if you are working under stress for prolonged periods of 
time you should stop once in a while for a mental and physical 
break advises ms seiler who has developed a series of 
exercises intended to take a persons mind off work problems 
increase upper body circulation and relieve the muscle strain that 
causes upper back pain 
the desk exercises can be done by men or women every two 
hours or as needed 
for afteroffice therapy at home ms seiler advocates a sound 
nights slumber to erase vestiges of workrelated tension 
a bed and its mattress directly affect the quality of sleep 
explains the therapist some like a firm mattress others a soft 
one but regardless of personal preference a mattress should 
provide support for the heavy parts of the body the hips and 
shoulders and disperse bodyweight uniformly 
and of course it should be comfortable 
the stressbreaker exercises developed by ms seiler are aimed 
at soothing upper back pain by relaxing tired tense musles and 
creating a warm suffused body glow due to increased circulation 
she says 
although designed to be done while at the desk they can also 
be done at home while sitting on the edge of your bed and are a 
good wakerupper to get you on your way to work feeling relaxed and 
refreshed 
the exercises each repeated five times and taking no more than 
one minute apiece are 
neck circles point chin to chest chin to each shoulder ear 
to each shoulder 
shoulder rolls move your shoulders up forward back and 
down relax and repeat 
shoulder lifts raise your shoulders up tighten and relax 
drop your shoulders tighten and relax 
self hug stretch arms across your chest hug yourself hold 
for five seconds and relax bend your elbows back tighten for five 
seconds and relax 
trunk stretch sit tall look straight ahead press shoulders 
back for count of five relax for count of five

the supreme court today let stand a decision 
generally barring foreign car manufacturers from forcing franchised 
us dealers to buy replacement parts exclusively from them 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by mercedesbenz 
of north america inc that had been supported by other foreign and 
domestic car makers 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled last september that 
mercedes violated antitrust restrictions on tiein arrangements by 
requiring franchised dealers to use genuine mercedesbenz parts 
when servicing customers cars 
the appeals court rejected mercedes argument that a 1936 
supreme court ruling granted car manufacturers an exemption from 
antitrust enforcement for tiein arrangements 
the appeals court also ordered a new trial to determine how much 
money mercedes must pay in damages to metrix warehouse inc an 
independent auto parts distributor 
a federal jury had ordered mercedes to pay metrix 7 million in 
damages the figure was based on 23 million in losses metrix said 
it suffered from 1977 through 1983 with the figure tripled under a 
provision of antitrust law 
a judge overturned the jury award on grounds some of the money 
metrix claimed it lost may have been the result of lawful 
competition and not illegal tiein arrangements 
mercedes which sold some 90000 cars in the united states in 
1987 said its 1 percent share of the us market depends on 
guarantees of high quality 
requiring franchised dealers to buy parts from the manufacturer 
is essential to assuring that quality mercedes said 
the 4th circuit court said many of the parts sold by metrix were 
made by the same companies that supplied mercedes metrix also said 
most of the parts were nonwarranty quickturnover items such as 
filters plugs hoses and belts 
but mercedes said it conducted random testing of the parts to 
assure they were not defective and metrix did not test the 
products 
mercedes said to maintain the goodwill of its customers it must 
assure meticulous supervison of the products components and 
services offered by its franchised dealers 
the 4th circuit court said mercedes could offer such assurance 
by less restrictive means than tiein arrangements 
for example the appeals court said mercedes could require 
dealers to tell customers the origin of replacement parts and 
could require that any parts sold by dealers meet certain 
specifications 
the appeals court also rejected a counterclaim by mercedes that 
metrix illegally offered incentives to dealers to induce them to 
purchase replacement parts from metrix 
automobile importers of america inc representing foreign car 
manufacturers and motor vehicle manufacturers association of the 
united states inc representing domestic producers supported the 
mercedes appeal 
the case is mercedesbenz vs metrix 871560

the supreme court today set aside a bankruptcy 
law ruling the federal government says could thwart efforts to 
collect back taxes from failed businesses 
the justices told a federal appeals court to restudy the ruling 
that limits the internal revenue services authority to collect 
taxes owed by bankrupt taxpayers 
the courts brief order suggested the case may have become moot 
or legally irrelevant the justices were told the debt involved has 
been paid off 
at issue in a case from tampa fla was whether debtors who 
seek protection from creditors by filing for reorganization under 
federal bankruptcy law may designate which back taxes they pay off 
first 
the irs in 1984 seized assets of aampb heating and air 
conditioning inc to satisfy the corporations backtaxes liability 
aampb then filed for reorganization and a bankruptcy judge 
ordered the tax agency to return the seized property to the 
bankruptcy estate 
the government then filed a claim so it could collect the back 
taxes both those aampb owed as an employer and trust fund taxes 
such as social security and income taxes aampb withheld from 
employees pay 
under the reorganization plan aampb was to pay off all debts 
including back taxes within six years the plan states that all 
payments to the irs shall be credited first to the trust fund 
portion of the claim until it is paid in full 
government lawyers objected to letting the bankruptcy trustee 
designate how the irs must apply the tax payments 
they argued that payments of priority taxes under bankruptcy 
protection are involuntary and therefore the debtor has no right 
to specify how the payments are to be applied 
a federal bankruptcy judge a federal trial judge and the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals ruled against the government the 
lower courts found that payments made under a bankruptcy 
reorganization plan are voluntary and therefore subject to such 
designations 
the governments chief concern is the possibility that aampb will 
not be able to comply with its sixyear plan the administrative 
office of the us courts estimates that 90 percent of all 
bankruptcy reorganization plans fail 
if back taxes were not fully paid off the aampb reorganization 
plans designation could reduce the governments tax recovery 
corporate officers and other officials responsible for sending 
withheld employee taxes to the federal government are personally 
liable for any amounts withheld but not sent in those same 
officers and officials are not personally responsible however for 
other unpaid corporate taxes 
payment of only the trust fund portion of the tax liability by 
the corporate debtor would eliminate the responsible officers 
potential liability but still leave the government unable to 
collect the remaining tax liability the governments appeal said 
justice department lawyers said the irs estimates that allowing 
such designations could cost up to 25 million in lost tax revenues 
the case is us vs aampb heating and air conditioning 871243

to sudden selloffs 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 216 points 
to 199271 by 11 am edt on wall street broader market indices

volume on the big board totaled 79 million shares after the first

nearly half the early trading volume came from dividendcapture 
strategies in one stock gte with more than 378 million shares 
changing hands at 35 down aside from that many investors just 
stayed away partly out of concern over the impact of the march 
trade deficit statistics to be released tuesday 
those figures which have come to symbolize americas economic 
weakness have jolted the market in the past when they exceeded 
expectations most economists believe the march number will fall 
between 12 billion and 13 billion down from 138 billion in 
february 
if the number comes in under double digits i think this 
market goes a lot higher puccio said but investors dont want 
to buy something today and look like idiots tomorrow thats the 
reason for the dullness 
william king head trader at nikko securities international in 
new york attributed some early strength in the market to a 
carryover from a mild rally on friday based on expectations that 
rising interest rates have stabilized for awhile but he said 
anxiety about the trade numbers stalled the rise today

ef hutton amp co paid more than 1 
million in fines today for its guilty plea to three federal money 
laundering charges involving its providence office 
hutton attorney e lawrence barcella jr signed the guilty plea 
and turned a check for the fine over to us attorney lincoln c 
almond 
the brokerage company was fined 10000 for one count of 
conspiracy and 500000 on each of two counts of violating federal 
cash transaction reporting laws 
the plea follows the may 6 filing of criminal charges against 
hutton in us district court accusing the company of failing to 
report at least 532000 in currency transactions at the providence 
office federal law requires that cash transactions of greater than 
10000 must be reported to the irs 
the people for whom the transactions were allegedly made were 
not named almond has said up to 12 million was involved some of 
it from organized crime figures and some from businesmen 
in addition to the three felony counts against the firm two 
former brokers at huttons providence office were also named in the 
documents known as a criminal information filed in court 
one of the brokers died shortly after the investigation began 
almond said charges against the other broker brian j lareau 46 
of jamestown ri were to have been filed last week 
hutton was acquired last year by shearson lehman brothers inc 
and the company is now known as shearson lehman hutton inc 
shearson spokesman michael oneill said today that after the 
merger with shearson all of huttons branches adopted the shearson 
policy of prohibiting cash deposits in any amount this should help 
deter any similar schemes in the future he said 
none of the people who were involved in any of the 
transactions are with the company anymore oneill said we 
dont see it as having any impact on the company 
almond said he did not know of wrongdoing at other hutton 
offices and said there was no evidence anyone other than the two 
brokers named may 6 had participated in the scheme 
under securities and exchange commission rules a felony 
conviction of the company could result in the suspension of 
investment services shearson said last month it expected to 
receive waivers from the sec that would allow it to continue 
business 
last october the sec found hutton had violated provisions of 
the sec law and rules relating to financial recordkeeping and 
reporting of currency transactions

reason for the dullness 
william king head trader at nikko securities international in 
new york attributed some early strength in the market to a 
carryover from a mild rally on friday based on expectations that 
rising interest rates have stabilized for awhile but he said 
anxiety about the trade numbers stalled the rise today

sharp differences among the major industrialized 
nations over trade and agricultural issues are expected to be aired 
at a meeting of ministers from the 24nation organization of 
economic cooperation and development oecd being held wednesday 
and thursday 
senior officials of the group said monday they do not expect any 
dramatic breakthroughs such as occurred last year when the 
ministers decided to measure costly subsidies to farmers as a first 
step to eliminating them 
the present situation does not give reason for a spectacular 
shift or reversal of policies said one of the officials who 
spoke at a press briefing on the understanding they would not be 
named 
the officials were alluding to the us presidential elections 
in november which rule out any major policy iniatives before then 
as well as continuing differences among the seven major 
industrialized countries over monetary policy 
in britain there is even disagreement between prime minister 
margeret thatcher and her finance minister over exchange rate 
policy there has just been a change of governments in france and 
west german chancellor helmut kohls position has been weakened 
sometimes referred to as the rich countries club the oecd 
groups the 24 main industrialized nations and focuses on economic 
issues for the group of seven main democracies the oecd meeting 
will serve as a dress rehearsal for nexts month world economic 
summit in ottawa 
on trade the officials said the current round of uruguay 
negotations was entering its most difficult phase 
they urged nations involved to settle their differences now and 
try to give the talks a new political impetus rather than wait 
until a ministerial review of the talks scheduled for montreal in 
december 
at the oecd meeting european nations are expected to seek a 
commitment from the united states to reduce what they regard as 
hostile trade practices before they will consider taking more 
action on eliminating farm subsidies 
trade and agriculture are two areas of contention where there 
could be some fireworks the officials said 
the officials said they hoped for freewheeling discussions on 
how to deal with the four dragons in southeast asia taiwan 
hong kong south korea and singapore 
they expect the end result to be instructions to the secretariat 
to begin informal talks with these nations and others known as 
newly industrialized countries or nics they said they would not 
be opposed to the nics eventually joining oecd 
these countries mounting trade surpluses are expected to exceed 
japans next year and pose a threat to reducing the us trade 
deficit the effort to seek a dialogue with the nics contrasts with 
the previous practice of lecturing them on what they should do

economic growth in the industrialized democracies 
will be much quicker in both 1988 and 1989 than was thought at the 
end of last year following the october markets crash according to 
oecd projections released monday 
the organization for economic cooperation and development 
confirmed that it has revised upward its projection for real or 
inflationadjusted gross national product growth to 3 percent for 
1988 from its december estimate of 225 percent 
the growth rate for 1989 is now expected to be around 25 
percent compared with a previous estimate of 175 percent 
the oecd which is made up of the worlds 24 most industrialized 
nations is now projecting that real growth in the united states 
will reach 275 percent in 1988 slowing slightly to 25 percent in 
1989 these figures were revised upward from the december estimates 
of 25 and 175 percent respectively 
growth rates in other major oecd member countries have also been 
adjusted west germany is expected to experience a 225 percent 
expansion in 1988 slowing to 175 percent in 1989 compared with 
earlier estimates of 15 percent and 175 percent respectively 
japan will have one of the strongest growth rates among the 
major industrialized countries with a projected 425 percent this 
year and 375 percent in 1989 the oecd said this compares with 
december forecasts of 35 percent and 3 percent respectively 
the latest oecd figures for inflation are littlechanged from 
those of the december 1987 outlook with rates of 35 percent 
expected for the 24 oecd member countries in 1988 and 375 percent 
projected for 1989 
on unemployment the oecd sees the average rate for the 
industrialized countries as a group at 75 percent in both 1988 and 
1989 compared with previous estimates of 8 percent for 1988 and 
825 percent for 1989

the purchase by the union pacific corp of 
the katy railroad a regional line that runs from nebraska to 
the gulf coast has been approved by the interstate commerce 
commission the agency announced today 
the iccs approval requires the union pacific and the 
missourikansastexas railroad as the katy is formally known 
to grant trackage rights to other railroads inseveral regions where 
direct competition otherwise would be reduced 
the icc approved the merger friday but it was not announced 
until today agency officials said 
the commission acknowledged that the merger would result in the 
elimination of some jobs and abandonment of more than 300 miles of 
tracks where the two rail systems run parallel tracks the 
railroads have said about 1000 jobs would be eliminated 
the commission concluded however that the benefits of the 
merger both to the public and to rail shippers outweigh the 
negative impact the public benefits will be achieved through 
reduced transportation costs and improved service for 
shippers said heather gradison icc chairman in a statement 
the icc said about 300 miles of track has been approved for 
abandonment including a 123mile stretch from henriette to durant 
in oklahoma the railroads have said facilities would be shut down 
in st louis kansas city fort worth and other points along the 
route system because of duplication 
ackowledging a concern about reduced competition for midwest 
grain shipments the icc said the union pacific must provide 
trackage rights to another railroad between omaha and kansas city 
to preserve the current level of competition 
it also required agreements with other rail lines in south texas 
where there were competitive concerns about the shipment of crushed 
rock from various texas points to houston an agreement with the 
southern pacific has alleviated that concern icc officials said

the supreme court today refused to exempt 
federally chartered international banks from being taxed by states 
and cities where the banks have branch offices 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal 
question let stand a ruling that continental bank international 
a subsidiary of chicagobased continental illinois national bank amp 
trust co must pay more than 6 million in taxes penalties and 
interest to new york city 
justice byron r white voted to hear the banks appeal but four 
votes are needed to grant such review 
the new york court of appeals the states highest court ruled 
last february continental is not exempt from the citys financial 
corporation tax 
city officials said the banks new york city branch owed 6075 
million for the periods sept 1 1980 to dec 31 1980 and jan 1 
1981 to dec 31 1981 
congress authorized federally chartered international banks in a 
1919 law the edge act to supply international credit and to 
secure foreign trade markets for us exports 
the federal reserve board regulates the banks which were given 
expanded power by congress in 1978 to mobilize resources to 
increase american overseas trade 
there are some 90 such banks with most of their offices 
concentrated in california florida illinois new york and texas 
continental international argued that like a federally 
chartered national bank it should be exempt from state and local 
taxes unless congress specifically authorized otherwise 
but the new york court said international banks are not 
federal instrumentalities entitled to constitutional immunity from 
tax 
the state court also said there is nothing in federal law to 
suggest congress intended to exempt branch offices of such banks 
from state and city taxes 
an intention of congress to deny the states power to tax edge 
act bank branches cannot be inferred from the language of the 
statute which is at best ambiguous on that subject the state 
court said 
the reagan administration endorsed the state court ruling 
justice department lawyers responding to a supreme court 
invitation to comment said the 1919 laws fairest reading is 
that it should not be interpreted to preclude taxation by 
states in which branch offices are located 
the case is continental bank vs new york city 861857

returned from a weekend that saw less rain than expected in most of 
the midwests corn and soybean areas 
new forecasts issued in the morning predicted dry conditions 
until at least midweek 
soybean futures prices now at fouryear highs are extremely 
sensitive to weather factors because us soybean stockpiles are 
dwindling and a good crop is needed to meet the anticipated demand 
analysts said

bushel per day while corn futures are limited to moves of 10 cents

the biggest commercial airplane 
order in history was split monday between boeing co and airbus 
industrie of europe with boeing grabbing the lions share of the 
504 billion 130plane purchase by international lease finance 
corp 
the planes are to be delivered over the next six years to 
international lease finance which leases planes to many of the 
worlds airlines for periods of three to 11 years 
all are socalled advanced technology planes which have 
relatively quite engines and incorporate other recent developments 
boeings workhorse 737 series snagged the biggest chunk of the 
order 72 of the 100 boeing planes ordered and a mix of 
widebody and jumbo jets make up the rest of the purchase from the 
seattle company the boeing order is worth 369 billion 
airbus a consortium of european aerospace companies led by its 
french and german partners will sell the leasing company 30 planes 
for 135 billion eighteen of the airbus planes will be a320200s 
mediumrange airliners similar to the 737 and the rest of the 
order is for widebody jets 
both manufacturers termed the agreement a marketing victory 
its a tremendous order said dean thornton president of 
boeing commercial airplanes co 
boeing spokeswoman elizabeth reese called the order a welcome 
vote of confidence following the recent failure of an aloha 
airlines boeing 737 over hawaii the top of the passenger cabin 
ripped off that plane in flight throwing a flight attendant to her 
death but the pilot managed to land safely 
we really need it after everything that happened ms reese 
said of the order 
airbus share falls only slightly shy of matching the 
consortiums us strategy which calls for gaining 30 percent of 
the market said gregg schulte spokesman at airbus us office in 
herndon va 
we feel like we got a very competitive part of the order 
schulte said i think it was always going to be a split order 
airbus also announced monday it had received an order for 15 
a320s from iberia airlines 
a spokesman for st louisbased mcdonnell douglas corp the 
other top competitor in the international market for commercial 
airliners said last week the company did not expect a share of the 
international lease finance order 
the boeing order consists of 72 planes of models 737300 
737400 and 737500 eight 757200s nine 767300ers four 
747400s and a previously unannounced order of six planes in the 
737 series and one 757200 
the airbus order consists of 18 model a320200s four 
a300600rs six a310300s and two a340300s 
boeing valued its share of the contract at 46 billion 
counting toward that total the price of 24 additional planes on 
which the company has options to buy 
with airbus international lease finance said it had an option 
to buy an additional 40 planes 
the largest civilian airplane order to date was in 1986 when 
british airways ordered 16 boeing 747s for 23 billion that deal 
includes options for 12 more of the jumbo jets that would bring the 
value to 41 billion 
international lease finance is confident customers will emerge 
for the approximately 25 planes a year the order will add to its 
fleet of 54 said kenneth taylor vice president for technical 
services 
he said the 15yearold company would finance the purchase 
through debt offerings and internally generated funds deliveries 
are set to begin in 1989 and run through 1995 
the purchase is intended to meet anticipated demand for 
fuelefficient quiet planes to replace aging airline fleets and 
accommodate expanded business from 1990 to 1995 said steven 
udvarhazy president of the leasing company 
leasing has become increasingly attractive to airlines because 
it offers both tax advantages and an opportunity to keep cash in 
hand rather than commit it to down payments and interest on loans 
analysts said 
the airlines think they need a lot of cash around and i think 
theyre right partly in the fear of some kind of fare war said 
andrew geller who follows the industry for provident national bank 
in philadelphia 
international lease finance also announced it had commitments to 
supply engines for the planes from general electriccfm 
international pratt amp whitney and from rolls royce the engines 
purchased will in some cases depend on the airline a particular 
plane is destined for taylor said 
the gecfm committments are worth an estimated 700 million and 
the pratt amp whitney commitments worth 230 million a value was not 
given for the rolls royce share

million judgment against an insurance company that had been ordered 
to pay the money to an injured mississippi man whose 20000 claim 
it wrongfully rejected 
but the justices declined to decide the constitutionality of 
large punitive damage awards in personal injury cases 
in another case the court ruled the federal communications 
commission has exclusive authority to regulate the technical 
quality of cable television signals it rejected arguments that 
state and local officials should be allowed to impose more 
stringent requirements for cable tv 
the court also agreed to decide whether new jersey unfairly is 
forcing 13 major oil companies to pay millions of dollars in taxes 
by denying state tax deductions for what the companies pay in 
federal windfall profits taxes 
in other major businessrelated rulings the court 
refused to exempt federally chartered international banks from 
being taxed by states and cities where the banks have branch 
offices the court let stand a ruling that continental bank 
international based in chicago must pay more than 6 million in 
taxes penalties and interest to new york city 
made it easier for people to file jobdiscrimination charges 
against employers by allowing flexibility for meeting some 
deadlines imposed by a federal antibias law the justices agreed 
with the reagan administration and revived a colorado sex 
discrimination case that was dismissed because deadlines for filing 
the complaint were missed 
let stand a decision generally barring foreign car 
manufacturers from forcing franchised us dealers to buy 
replacement parts exclusively from them it rejected an appeal by 
mercedesbenz of north america inc that had been supported by 
other foreign and domestic car makers 
ruled that states may tax the costs of producing merchandise 
catalogs mailed directly to instate residents even when the 
catalogs are published in other states the court unanimously 
rejected an attempt by a new orleansbased department store chain 
to avoid paying taxes for catalogs received by its louisiana 
customers 
in the insurance case the court left unresolved the question of 
skyrocketing damage awards some states reacting to soaring 
insurance rates have imposed ceilings on how much money can be 
recovered in personal injury lawsuits 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the the court said 
settling the issue now would shortcircuit a number of less 
intrusive and possibly more appropriate resolutions 
the justices did decide a lesser issue raised in the dispute 
upholding a mississippi law that imposed a 15 percent penalty 
243000 against the insurance company for unsuccesfully 
appealing the case to the mississippi supreme court the vote on 
that issue was 61 
the case involved lloyd crenshaw of pascagoula miss whose leg 
was amputated less than two weeks after he injured it in his garage 
in 1979 
crenshaw 61 at the time worked at the white stores in 
pascagoula his employer had a group insurance policy with bankers 
life and casualty co 
a state jury ruled that bankers life acted in bad faith in 
denying crenshaws claim and awarded him 20000 in actual damages 
and 16 million in punitive damages 
the insurance company said the punitive damage judgment violates 
the constitution but that issue was not raised or passed upon by 
the mississippi courts 
in the cable television case the court said the fcc acted 
within the statutory authority conferred by congress when it 
preempted state and local technical standards governing the 
quality of cable television signals 
the fcc has divided cable services into four categories the 
first consists of cable channels that deliver signals of television 
stations that are normally broadcast through the air 
the other classes include cable channels such as cable news 
network and espn pay channels such as home box office and 
channels with twoway interaction capability 
the us circuit court of appeals ruled last year the fcc has 
exclusive control over the signal quality of the first class of 
cable channels the appeals court also ordered the fcc to develop 
standards for assuring the quality of the signals in the latter 
three categories 
the first part of the appeals court ruling was appealed by the 
national league of cities new york city officials and other 
communities who said state county and city governments should be 
allowed to impose signal quality standards for cable channels that 
carry television broadcast stations 
in its ruling the supreme court said a 1984 federal law 
endorses a dual system of cable tv regulation giving local 
officials power to award franchises but leaving control over 
technical quality of cable signals with the fcc 
in the new jersey tax case the oil companies which operate 
numerous refineries in the state challenged a state business tax 
law that disallows a deduction for windfall profits tax payments 
the companies said the state tax is unfair because the windfall 
profits tax is based on oil production none of which takes place 
in new jersey 
the new jersey supreme court upheld the state tax last june 
saying it does not discriminate unfairly against the oil companies 
the oil companies paid an extra 885 million in taxes to new 
jersey from 1980 through 1984 because of the state tax disallowance 
the tax challenge was mounted by amerada hess atlantic 
richfield conoco cities service exxon phillips petroleum 
chevron mobil oil union oil of california gulf oil shell oil 
tenneco oil and texaco

a mild burst of lateafternoon buying helped 
boost the stock market today after a mixed session marked by 
extremely light volume and postcrash investor apathy 
traders said rumors of a lowerthanexpected march trade 
deficit a statistic to be released tuesday morning by the commerce 
department helped wall street in the final few hours 
it looks like theyre expecting good figures said robert 
otoole manager of overthecounter trading at shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york 
traders said a figure sharply lower than the anticipated 12 
billion to 13 billion deficit would provide some muchneeded 
optimism for wall street which has been plagued by a loss of 
confidence since the crash seven months ago 
the monthly trade deficit figures have come to symbolize the 
american economys competitive weaknesses and are closely watched 
by the financial markets because they can influence the dollars 
value interest rates and the federal reserves monetary policy

ef hutton amp co on monday paid 101 
million in fines for a moneylaundering scheme in which 15 
million in cash was hidden from the government for clients some of 
them members of organized crime 
hutton attorney e lawrence barcella jr signed a guilty plea to 
three felony counts and turned a check for the fine over to us 
attorney lincoln c almond 
the brokerage company was fined 10000 for conspiracy to 
violate the bank secrecy act and 500000 for each of two counts of 
violating federal cash transaction reporting laws the fines were 
the maximum allowed under the law 
criminal charges filed may 6 in us district court accused 
hutton of failing to report at least 532000 in currency 
transactions at the providence office 
on monday however authorities said that as part of the scheme 
two former hutton brokers helped clients hide about 15 million 
from the internal revenue service 
cash transactions of 10000 or more must be reported to the irs 
authorities said briefcases stuffed with cash were brought into 
huttons providence office in an activity known as smurfing 
secretaries carrying envelopes full of money were then dispatched 
to different area banks the same day to buy bearer bonds or 
certificates of deposit for less than 10000 
authorities said the scheme came to light when a bank employee 
noticed a hutton secretary purchased two bonds for just under 
10000 the same day 
the transactions were made under fictitious names for legitimate 
businessmen and members of organized crime according to almond and 
jeremiah t osullivan head of the justice departments new 
england organized crime strike force 
stephen fusco a hutton broker who died of cancer about two 
years ago handled the accounts authorities have linked to 
organized crime 
the address for one client was the same north providence 
apartment where raymond ls patriarca longtime boss of the new 
england mob was found dead of a heart attack in july 1984 while 
another account was linked to a convicted mob pornographer who used 
it to buy an adult book store in boston 
the money laundering which authorities say began in may 1982 
stopped one month after patriarcas death 
fusco and the other former hutton broker were also named in the 
criminal information documents filed in court brian j lareau 46 
of jamestown was scheduled to be arraigned tuesday for money 
laundering and false representation of a social security account 
numberr 
osullivan and almond said lareau had no ties to organized 
crime and that he and fusco were not partners in their alleged 
illegal activities 
hutton was acquired last year by shearson lehman brothers inc 
and the company is now known as shearson lehman hutton inc after 
the merger all the firms branches adopted the shearson policy of 
prohibiting cash deposits in any amount shearson spokesman michael 
oneill said 
as part of the plea agreement the government stated no one 
above the providence branch office level of the company was 
involved and that the money laundering occurred prior to the 
acquisition of the defendant by the shearson lehman co 
none of the people who were involved in any of the 
transactions are with the company anymore oneill said we 
dont see it as having any impact on the company 
under federal securities and exchange commission rules the 
companys felony conviction could cause a suspension of its 
investment services 
oneill however said the company should be able to obtain 
exemptions from any federal sanctions it could face glen a payne 
assistant director of the secs investment management division 
said shearson filed for a temporary exemption to the sanctions 
monday 
sometime in the next eight months the commission will make a 
decision on the firms request for permanent protection based on an 
outside audit of shearson and its efforts set up procedures to 
follow the cash transaction reporting laws payne said 
last october the sec censured hutton for violating provisions 
of the sec law and rules relating to financial recordkeeping and 
reporting of currency transactions

eastman kodak co agreed monday to reimburse at 
least 42 million owners of its obsolete instant cameras as part of 
a proposed 150 million settlement of a class action lawsuit 
against the company 
under the settlement proposal us owners of the cameras would 
receive between 50 and 70 in cash and coupons 
kodak stopped selling instant cameras and instant film after a 
federal court in 1985 said the company had violated patents held by 
polaroid corp 
millions of people own one of the 39 camera models made useless 
by the ruling which barred the manufacture of compatible film 
from the start our primary objective has been to make an 
attractive exchange program available to our kodak customers 
said wilbur j prezzano group vice president of kodaks 
photographic products division 
we have worked hard to help reach this settlement and we are 
pleased with the results prezzano said 
under the proposed agreement filed with cook county circuit 
judge thomas rakowski instant camera owners would receive 50 
55 60 or 70 in cash and kodak coupons depending on the model 
of their instant camera 
cash and coupons will be disbursed when rakowski gives his final 
approval to the settlement which is expected sept 19 
the proposed settlement is limited to us owners 
when kodaks instant film was no longer available a group of 
chicago attorneys led by burton i weinstein filed a classaction 
lawsuit on behalf of camera owners in 1986 
kodak based in rochester ny said the settlement could cover 
as many 16 million people since the company made that many instant 
cameras for domestic sale between 1976 and 1985 
but weinstein said he would be surprised if many other owners 
emerge in addition to the 42 million who are parties to the 
lawsuit 
we think we have garnered the entire universe he said 
outside rakowskis courtroom 
still kodak will publicize the settlement in 100 newspapers may 
22 anyone who owns an instant camera and is not yet a party to the 
lawsuit can clip the claim form and send it in along with the 
cameras nameplate by aug 1 
we think the settlement is fair just and adequate 
weinstein said 
the lawsuit had challenged kodaks original proposed settlement 
for camera owners of a kodak disc camera a 50 coupon or one share 
of kodak stock 
instant photography was invented by dr edwin h land founder 
of polaroid and was first marketed in 1948 
the invention enabled users to view a photographic print within 
minutes of taking a picture conventional photography requires 
development and printing of exposed film in a darkroom 
polaroid retained a monopoly in the instant photography field 
until 1976 when kodak entered the market with a competing system 
a week after that entry polaroid sued kodak for patent 
infringement 
a federal judge in boston sided with polaroid and the us 
supreme court let stand lower court rulings when it refused to hear 
kodaks appeal in october 1986

chrysler corp is cutting production of the 
eagle premier the flagship car of its new jeepeagle division 
because of slowerthanexpected sales during a difficult 
imagebuilding period 
for two weeks in june and again for a previously scheduled 
twoweek vacation period in late july chrysler will close the 
brandnew former american motors corp assembly plant in bramalea 
ontario which builds premier 
bramaleas assembly line will produce 50 fewer cars a day when 
the plant reopens after the shutdown during the weeks of june 13 
and june 20 chrysler spokesman baron bates said monday bramalea 
now builds about 360 cars a day 
through april 30 bramalea had built more than 24000 cars this 
year and dealers had sold less than 10000 sales had been 
increasing steadily throughout 1988 and bates said chrysler 
expected them to reach 5000 cars a month by june 
at the end of both march and april unsold inventories averaged 
133 days supply twice the industry norm of about 60 to 65 days 
supply 
bates said chrysler is pleased with premiers progress because 
the car is attracting younger more affluent buyers than other 
chrysler products and has not taken sales away from chrysler dodge 
or plymouth 
analysts agreed that premier is a good car whose launch has been 
difficult because the eagle name and lineup is not familiar to 
buyers and the market has been crowded with buyer incentives 
it has been further hampered by the dealer network that sells 
it they said 
the kind of traffic that you get into an old american motors 
dealership wasnt really the type thats going to go out and buy a 
midsize car said ted sullivan analyst with wharton 
econometrics in philadelphia 
sullivan said amc dealers have attracted upscale buyers for 
jeep but added that jeep buyers are not buying premiers 
part of the problem is the way it has to be marketed through 
amc dealers who havent had a car to sell for a long time said 
david healy analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
if youre in the market for an auditype midsize car your 
amc dealer is not the place you think of first to go look for 
one he said chryslers trying to change that 
chrysler bought amc in august beginning with french 
governmentowned renaults 461 percent interest in the ailing 
automaker under an agreement with renault which designed the 
premier and helped amc build the bramalea plant chrysler buys 
major components including engines and transmissions from renault 
because of the weakness of the dollar against western european 
currencies that arrangement is cutting severely chryslers profits 
on premier as the imported parts become more expensive analysts 
said 
but the car and the entire jeepeagle network still is 
faring far better under chrysler than it would have under amc they 
said 
if they kept the amc nameplate it would have been extremely 
difficult to make a success of the car because amc had a negative 
image now they are starting over with no image said chris 
cedergren analyst with j d power and associates in agoura hills 
calif 
its better to have no image than a negative image he said 
this summer chrysler will add a fourdoor upscale new car 
called the eagle summit and based on the japanese mitsubishi mirage 
to the lineup followed in 1989 by a sports coupe built at a 
chryslermitsubishi plant in bloomingtonnormal ill 
the summit will help draw buyers to the show room the more 
buyers you draw the more premiers youll sell cedergren said

concerns precious metals were mixed cattle futures advanced oil 
futures were higher and stockindex futures rose 
buyers dominated the grain markets from the opening bell as 
traders returned from a weekend that saw less rain than expected in 
most of the midwests corn and soybean areas

until at least midweek the national weather services 
sixto10day forecast issued after the close called for 
belownormal rainfall may 2226 in most of the midwest

than 30 cents a bushel per day while corn futures are limited to 
moves of 10 cents a bushel

790 a bushel trader victor lespinasse of the investment firm 
dean witter reynolds inc said 8 soybeans are likely 
then my goal is 10 assuming the weather remains a little 
drier than normal he said 
the agriculture department reported monday corn planting was 
about 88 percent complete sunday while just under 40 percent of the 
us soybean crop had been planted so no real damage has been done 
yet by dry weather said cathy leow assistant vice president for 
grain trading at thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
ms leow predicted more moderate price movement in the soybean 
market on tuesday and wednesday 
i think weve moved enough for the next three days she said

delivery in may at 319 a bushel corn was 8 cents to 10 cents 
higher with may at 207 a bushel oats were 6 cents to 7 cents

cents higher with the may contract on which the daily price limit 
has been removed because of the contracts upcoming expiration at 
750 a bushel

surge in cotton futures on the new york cotton exchange where most 
contracts traded up the 2centsapound daily limit

mercantile exchange ahead of the usdas monthly sevenstate 
cattleonfeed report which was released after the close 
the report showed 4 percent more cattle being fattened for 
slaughter on may 1 compared to a year earlier the number was 
within the markets expectations 
the report also showed 9 percent fewer feedlot placements and 5 
percent more cattle marketed in april those numbers were construed 
as positive by analysts who predicted higher futures prices on 
tuesday 
live cattle settled 55 cent lower to 65 cent higher with june

a mild burst of lateafternoon buying helped 
salvage a directionless stockmarket session monday and nudged the 
key dow jones industrial average back over the 2000 level 
brokers said optimism that the march tradedeficit numbers to be 
released tuesday would show substantial improvement strengthened 
the market in the final hours offsetting pessimism caused by 
evidence of rising commodity prices which means higher inflation 
the dow average of 30 industrial stocks which seesawed in a 
narrow range for much of the day closed 1708 points higher at 
200763 its first finish above 2000 since last tuesday broader 
market indicators also rose 
the market appears to be putting in a pretty good accounting 
for itself considering the factors against it said joseph 
barthel technical strategist for the philadelphia investment firm 
butcher amp singer inc 
nevertheless business on the new york stock exchange remained 
extremely sluggish a reflection of the investor apathy that has 
plagued the stock market since the crash seven months ago

million friday but without the dividendrelated trading in one

theres a lot of cash on the sidelines said robert otoole 
manager of overthecounter trading at shearson lehman hutton inc 
in new york when it comes in its going to be a beautiful 
market but i dont see it coming in 
most economists expect the march trade deficit number released 
by the commerce department to total between 12 billion and 13 
billion down from an unexpectedly high 138 billion in february 
that number released april 14 contributed to a 10146point 
selloff in the dow average 
the financial markets are highly sensitive to the trade numbers 
because they have come to symbolize americas economic weaknesses 
a high deficit translates into a cheaper dollar inflation and the 
necessity for higher interest rates

a 369 billion jet order received by boeing co 
demonstrates the airplane manufacturers reputation has been unhurt 
and may even have been helped by recent air safety incidents 
industry analysts said monday 
an aloha airlines incident in which part of a boeing 737s 
fuselage came off during a flight over hawaii was called a 
positive not a negative for boeing by judith l comeau an 
aerospace industry analyst with goldman sachs amp co in new york 
that incident underscored the need to place new orders ms 
comeau said 
the integrity of that 737 was impressive its unfortunate 
that one person died but remember all the others landed safely 
ms comeau said 
other analysts agreed that while passenger concerns may have 
been raised by the aloha airlines incident people within the 
airline industry continue to place great faith in boeings jets 
that faith was evident monday when boeing which has about 60 
percent of the worlds commercial airplane market captured 77 
percent of the biggest commercial airplane order in history 
interational lease finance ordered 130 planes 100 from boeing 
and 30 from airbus industrie a consortium of europeanbased 
airlines the order was for 504 billion with planes to be 
delivered over the next six years 
boeings workhorse 737 series snagged the biggest chunk of the 
order 72 of the 100 boeing planes ordered and a mix of 
widebody and jumbo jets made up the rest of the order 
boeing spokeswoman elizabeth reese called the order a vote of 
confidence in light of the aloha airlines incident 
we really need it after everything that happened ms reese 
said of the order 
william whitlow jr a seattlebased securites analyst for dain 
bosworth inc said boeing might see more orders because of the 
aloha airlines incident and other fuselage cracks reported in the 
wheel well of an american airlines jet 
it didnt hurt boeing in fact these things have strengthened 
their position in that people will start to look at airplanes and 
admit that theres an end to their usefulness whitlow said 
age is going to become a factor and that means demand will 
increase because people are going to have to start retiring 
airplanes earlier than they might have he said 
the boeing order consists of 72 planes of models 737300 
737400 and 737500 eight 757200s nine 767300ers four 
747400s and a previously unannounced order of six planes in the 
737 series and one 757200 
the airbus order consists of 18 model a320200s four 
a300600rs six a310300s two a340300s and options for 40 more 
planes 
boeing valued its share of the contract at 46 billion 
counting toward that total the price of 24 additional planes on 
which the company has options to buy 
the largest civilian airplane order to date was in 1986 when 
british airways ordered 16 boeing 747s for 23 billion that deal 
includes options for 12 more of the jumbo jets that would bring the 
value to 41 billion

eastern airlines and continental airlines on 
monday announced new cutrate fares for children and senior 
citizens for the summer and at least one other major airline 
quickly followed suit 
the two airlines also said they were easing some restrictions 
now attached to regular maxsaver deepdiscount fares 
the new junior and senior maxsavers which range from 29 to 99 
one way are about 30 percent lower than current maxsaver fares 
they are available for travel between june 1 and sept 11 for 
children under 18 and seniors over 65 
these new fares make summer travel more affordable for the 
entire family continental president martin shugrue told a 
televised news conference originating in new york and los angeles 
grandparents can share in a summer excursion at a price that is 
practical even on a fixed income 
continental launched a media blitz to publicize the new fares 
including a series of television commercials featuring nonagenarian 
comedian george burns 
i dont think this is a panicked response to lower passenger 
demand said anthony hatch an airline analyst for argus research 
corp he said the new fares mainly designed to garner favorable 
publicity for the beleaguered carriers are not likely to have a 
significant impact on their profit 
eastern and continental both subsidiaries of giant texas air 
corp are the targets of new highly publicized federal 
investigations into their finances and the safety of their fleets 
the two airlines said they were cutting fares for children and 
seniors because they have found those segments of the flying public 
to be very sensitive to price changes airlines normally raise 
fares at this time of the year since it is the start of the peak 
travel season 
some observers suggested privately however that eastern and 
continental may have introduced the cheap fares to fill seats made 
vacant by slack summer bookings partly due to negative publicity 
from the new federal inspections 
united airlines the nations largest carrier said monday it 
will match the special fares in the markets where it competes with 
continental 
continental is a major competitor of ours said united 
spokesman joe hopkins noting that both airlines have major hubs at 
denver 
spokesmen for northwest airlines american airlines and delta 
air lines said officials of those carriers were studying the new 
fares and considering matching them 
eastern and continental also said they were loosening some 
restrictions on regular maxsaver fares for a price in some cases 
the new rules allow travelers to change the flight on the return 
portion of their maxsaver ticket when the change is made before the 
scheduled departure time of the original return flight and at 
least two days before the departure of the new flight a 75 
service charge must be paid to make the changes 
minimumstay requirements were eased by allowing fliers to 
return after 4 pm on saturday rather than the current obligation 
to stay past midnight that day 
maxsavers are good for travel between noon on mondays and noon 
on thursdays they must be purchased in advance for a round trip 
and are nonrefundable 
the new fares for children and senior citizens carry the same 
restrictions as the regular liberalized maxsavers and children 
flying on junior maxsavers must be accompanied by an adult who can 
use any fare 
in addition to the junior and senior maxsavers eastern is 
offering a summer roundtrip fare of 79 to 99 for children to fly 
to 14 florida cities

the giant swiss food manufacturer nestle sa said 
monday it was increasing its 147 percent stake in rowntree plc in 
a continued effort to take over the british candy maker 
nestle said it purchased more rowntree shares friday and monday 
the swiss company has offered to buy rowntree for 21 billion 
pounds or 395 billion 
judging by the modest volume of trade nestles total purchases 
were small according to official stock exchange figures which 
count both the buy and sell side of a transaction 11 million 
rowntree shares changed hands 
nestle is also the object of a controversial takeover bid from 
the swiss company jacobs suchard which has a 299 percent stake in 
the company the maximum allowed under british takeover regulations 
short of a full takeover bid

a handful of major wall street investment houses 
had no comment late monday on the reagan administration working 
groups recommendations to prevent gyrations in the stock market 
the report recommended the adopting of a circuit breaker 
mechanism that would shut down trading in the stock and futures 
markets if the dow jones industrial average falls 250 points from 
its previous close 
on a separate issue the working group headed by treasury 
secretary james a baker iii said existing margin requirements 
appear to be adequate 
on wall street spokesmen for merrill lynch amp co first boston 
corp bear stearns amp co and shearson lehman hutton inc had no 
comment on the recommendation they said they needed more time to 
study the report 
but new york stock exchange spokesman richard torrenzano said 
there did not seem to be any surprise in the announcement 
basically what they had said is what theyve been discussing 
before 
torrenzano said he was not sure the report would affect 
operations at the exchange because nothing has been put into 
place yet 
the working group was appointed in march as a followup to a 
white houseappointed commission chaired by wall street investment 
banker nicholas f brady the group issued its report amid 
criticism that the administration has not gone far enough to 
prevent a recurrence of the oct 19 market crash when the dow 
average plunged 508 points in a single session 
currently there is no mechanism in place that can halt trading

the reagan administration working group on the 
stock market crash issued a report monday recommending a variety of 
modest financial market changes aimed at preventing a recurrence of 
last octobers market crash 
treasury secretary james a baker iii who headed the group 
defended the panels recommendations against charges by critics 
that it did not go far enough in protecting individual investors 
the working group has recognized that no one has a monopoly on 
wisdom in this particular field and that neverending debate over a 
perfect solution would be the enemy of very good solutions baker 
said in presenting the report at a news briefing 
the panels major recommendation was that a circuit breaker 
mechanism be adopted to shut down trading in the stock and futures 
markets when extreme market movements threaten the entire system 
the panel said all trading should be halted for one hour on both 
stock and stock index futures markets if at any time the dow jones 
industrial average declines by 250 points from its closing level on 
the previous day 
there is currently no such requirement for all trading to be 
halted however the 250point limit is so broad that it would have 
been triggered only once in history on black monday last oct 19 
when the market plunged a record 508 points in a single day 
the nextlargest singleday decline in the market was a 
15683point fall last oct 26 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan another member of 
the working group said no one in this group likes circuit 
breakers and therefore the decision was made to make the trigger 
broad enough that it would be tripped only on rare occasions 
in another area the panel said it had been unable to agree on 
tougher margin or credit requirements to be imposed on investors 
but it said it believed that the existing requirements were 
generally adequate 
while sec chairman david ruder favored imposition of tougher 
margin requirements he was outvoted by the other members of the 
working group 
the recommendations by the working group brought immediate 
criticism that the administration has not gone far enough to 
prevent a recurrence of last falls market collapse 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee said that while the working group had come up 
with some useful recommendations it was hamstrung by the fact 
that the sec was the only agency on the administration panel with 
the legal mandate to protect investors 
the consensus approach to regulatory coordination is destined 
to fail dingell said in a statement within the working group 
the sec will be constantly outvoted and crippled by those who value 
ideology more than confidence in our capital markets 
but the panel said in a letter transmitting its recommendations 
to president reagan that it believed its proposals would promote 
the orderly operation of the nations financial markets and 
maintain the confidence of investors both large and small 
the working group was created in march as a followup to a white 
houseappointed commission chaired by wall street investment banker 
nicholas f brady 
in addition to baker greenspan and ruder other members of the 
panel were wendy gramm chairwoman of the commodity futures trading 
commission and treasury undersecretary george gould who 
represented baker in most of the meetings 
richard torrenzano spokesman for the new york stock exchange 
said there had been no surprises in the recommendations 
basically what they said is what theyve been discussing 
before he said 
the fed the sec and the cftc are the principal federal agencies 
which currently regulate the financial markets 
the five members of the brady commission earlier this month 
issued a letter critical of the lack of government reponse to the 
sweeping reform proposals they had made in january the statement 
urged quick government action before another stock market crisis 
occurs 
but the commissions proposals were not viewed favorably by the 
administration which has been a strong opponent of what it viewed 
as any interference of the operation of free markets despite calls 
for greater action in congress 
rep edward markey dmass chairman of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee with direct oversight of financial markets 
said in only 60 days the presidents working group has turned 
the brady commissions bible on financial markets into a tower of 
babel 
he said it would now be up to congress to take the necessary 
regulatory actions that the administration failed to recommend 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the senate banking 
committee has introduced a bill that would create a threemember 
committee to coordinate regulation consisting of the chairmen of 
the sec cftc and the federal reserve board the fed chairman would 
head the panel but disputes would be resolved by majority vote

after a threeyear split brazil on 
monday began formal talks with the international monetary fund and 
announced economic goals to slash its budget deficit and soaring 
inflation 
president jose sarney announced his administrations objectives 
through 1989 after an allmorning meeting with the nations 
governors 
the economic aims are a basis for lengthy negotiations with the 
imf although it has made its imf loan payments brazil stopped 
negotating with the fund in 1985 saying its policies were 
recessionary 
sarney said brazil planned to cut inflation maintain economic 
growth at 4 percent and cut the huge gaps in distribution of wealth 
with three goals 
immediate reduction of the public deficit to 4 percent from 55 
percent 
greater opening of brazil to international markets starting 
with reestablishment of relations with international financial 
communities including the imf 
modernization and expansion of the economy 
details of the economic goals were to be worked out at a later 
date 
finance minister mailson da nobrega said specific measures to be 
announced later in the week would include a 09 percent cut in the 
budget deficit a new industrial policy and new trade rules to open 
brazils market to foreign competition 
an imf team led by the south atlantic division chief thomas 
reichmann started talks monday with the central bank and the 
finance ministry on lending brazil 15 billion in standby money 
over the next 18 months 
reichmann said brazil owes the fund 26 billion 900 million 
of which is due in 1988 
brazil owes 123 billion to foreign banks and after a 11month 
moratorium on interest payments reached a preliminary agreement 
earlier this year to reschedule some 64 billion in interest and 
principal due over 20 years with an eightyear grace period 
we are here to help brazilian authorities in what we can and 
at the same time the imfs goal is to promote harmony in whatever 
way we can reichmann said at a news conference but we are not 
part of the negotiations with private banks 
however one of the private bankers requirements to renegotiate 
their loans was that brazil resume relations with the imf 
brazil eased its hardline stand against the imf in mid1987

day of a walkout against firestone inc monday while a strike 
deadline drew closer at goodyear tire amp rubber co 
urw and goodyear representatives were scheduled to meet tuesday 
morning hours before the noon deadline for 15000 workers at 11 
goodyear plants it was not clear monday how many plants would 
participate if a walkout occurred 
the rubber workers policy committee for goodyear which 
includes the local presidents from each of the 11 plants was 
scheduled to meet at 8 am with goodyear officials in akron said 
urw spokesman curt brown 
the union set a strike deadline after goodyear balked at going 
back to the bargaining table in light of worker rejection of a 
tentative contract settlement 
brown said the policy committee faced a number of options and 
that a strike could be averted or postponed depending on tuesdays 
meeting 
we still have a few hours until the strike deadline at noon 
tuesday and we intend to use the time to see if a strike can be 
averted goodyear said in a statement 
both parties traditionally have been willing to work up to the 
last minute to avoid strikes that create hardships for employees 
and affect the companys competitive position goodyear said 
well do our best to resolve our differences 
although 11 goodyear plants nationwide were involved in the 
contract talks not all are expected to participate if a walkout 
occurs six of the locals have approved the contract although it 
was rejected nationally 
brown said if a strike is sanctioned by the international union 
each local would decide whether to join the walkout 
in lincoln neb union leaders have already decided goodyear 
workers will stay on the job according to urw local 286 vice 
president lee domeier the locals bargaining committee and 
executive board unanimously approved the decision to keep working

contract by a 31 ratio voted 722691 in favor of striking on 
tuesday 
there were no talks scheduled in the contract dispute between 
firestone and some 4700 rubber workers 
the union wanted the goodyear contract to serve as an 
industrywide pattern the union went on strike against firestone on 
sunday because firestone failed to meet the pattern urw president 
milan stone said 
firestone officials however said their latest offer was 
equal in value and in cost to the pattern 
the goodyear contract proposal did not include a pay raise 
although there were improvements in costofliving allowances and 
pension and health insurance benefits 
the third of the nations big three tire makers uniroyal 
goodrich tire co came to terms in midapril in a contract taking 
into account the companys special needs as a result of the recent
