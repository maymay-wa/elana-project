congress on friday approved a 32 billion 
budget for the district of columbia after attaching a strong 
antiabortion amendment and a measure allowing georgetown 
university to deny certain rights to gay groups prompting a threat 
by city officials to shut down the local government 
im not sure the outcome is in the best interests of this 
body the district of columbia or the country sen tom harkin 
diowa said as the senate approved the budget late friday night 
in the way the district spends its own money the congress need 
not be intervening 
the bill was sent to president reagan for his signature less 
than an hour before midnight when the new fiscal year began 
in approving the citys 32 billion fiscal year 1989 budget 
the house and senate added an amendment that would freeze the 537 
million federal payment for the districts budget and prevent the 
city from spending its own money if medicaidfunded abortions are 
performed on women whose lives are not threatened 
the spending bill also would allow georgetown university to go 
back on its agreement to allow gay student associations to meet on 
campus and apply for student government funds 
the roman catholic school had reached an agreement with the gay 
groups in march after the district of columbia superior court and 
court of appeals upheld a finding by the citys human rights office 
that georgetown was discriminating against gay groups georgetown 
officials have said that they will not go back on their agreement 
with the student groups regardless of what congress decided 
walter fauntroy the nonvoting democratic delegate to congress 
from the district was angered by the intrusion into local affairs 
and said he would encourage city officials to disobey the 
abortionfunding prohibition to trigger a congressionally mandated 
shutdown of city government such a move would leave congress with 
the responsibility of governing the nations capital 
you will forgive me having respected you for 18 years if i 
suggest to my mayor and people that work for this city government 
that maybe its time to end this facade a tearful fauntroy told 
his house colleagues in a meeting where the final touches were put 
on the budget if congress wants to decide every little detail 
maybe its time to do that 
david clarke chairman of the district of columbia council 
concurred with fauntroy saying i believe it is time for the 
people of the district of columbia to take to the streets to defend 
their constitutional rights 
the abortion measure offered by rep robert dornan rcalif 
toughens current legislation which allows the city to use locally 
generated funds for abortions and restricts federal funds for use 
by rape and incest victims women suffering through ectopic 
pregnancies or when the mothers life is threatened

alarmed by outbursts of 
antiamericanism during the olympics south korean officials are 
trying to defuse the criticism and halt growing admiration for the 
soviet union 
president roh taewoo and other top officials thursday called on 
south koreans to stop criticizing the united states for a series of 
incidents during the games and to remember the nations close ties 
we should not let onetime feelings damage the traditionally 
friendly relations between the united states and our nation said 
prime minister lee hyunjae 
the antiamerican sentiment was sparked by the behavior of some 
us athletes during the olympics and us media coverage of the 
games 
south koreans have pointed to the unruly behavior of the us 
team at the games opening ceremony and to what they called the 
rude and arrogant manner of many americans they expressed 
resentment that the american media didnt play up the arrest of two 
us olympic swimmers for removing a lions head ornament from a 
seoul hotel lobby 
some koreans also complain that their main ally is unwilling to 
recognize south koreas achievements 
south korean newspapers and television networks bristled with 
angry denounciations of the nbc television network for playing up a 
boxing incident last week in which south korean boxing officials 
attacked a referee who awarded a match against a local favorite 
some commentators said nbc and other us media covered the 
brawl to embarrass the olympic host nation claiming the americans 
had organized a conspiracy against the south korean boxers 
but president roh defended nbc coverage saying even if the 
reports of nbc included something that hurt our selfesteem we 
should put up with it since most of the networks reports were 
affirmative 
the antiamerican outbursts have been confined to the press and 
popular opinion and there has been no apparent impact on relations 
but leaders warned the antiamerican sentiment could endanger south 
koreas interests 
the vehemently anticommunist officials who initially played a 
role in criticizing american behavior became alarmed when south 
koreans showed a growing public interest in the soviet union one 
of seouls main enemies in the past 
citizens seemed enraptured by their first encounter with soviet 
athletes and officials soviet ballet and cultural offerings 
during the olympics sold out soviet goods disappeared in minutes 
at stores and soviet athletes were praised for their dignified 
conduct 
the spread of antius and prosoviet sentiment may have a 
serious impact on relations between south korea and the united 
states said yoon gieljoong chairman of the governments 
democratic justice party 
government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
it was hard to believe south koreans would admire the soviet union 
a longhated enemy that shot down a south korean jetliner in 1983 
we should think seriously about what kind of country it was to 
us in the past said government spokesman kim zoongwie kim who 
reminded his countrymen that the soviet union backed north korea 
during the korean war in the 1950s and was still the norths main 
ally 
worried government officials also reminded koreans that the 
united states still has 42000 troops in the country under a mutual 
defense treaty and is seouls main market and vital to its 
continued prosperity 
it would be just like cutting off our own feet if korea 
destroys its trade with the united states the korea economic 
daily said 
this is the time to confirm once again that uskorean 
relations are so valuable that they cannot be ruined carelessly 
the newspaper added

the united nations scorned for years as 
too weak and politicized to forge peace is on a comeback and 
enjoying new respectability for its peacemaking successes in 
afghanistan and the persian gulf 
its renaissance and its expanding role in the international 
arena were crowned on thursday with the award of the nobel peace 
prize for 40 years of peacekeeping 
for nearly eight years washington rebuked the un accusing it 
of antiwestern bias and bureaucracy and punished it with a 
crippling withholding of us dues 
but for the past six months the united nations has been on a 
roll toting up success after success in conflict resolution with 
more to come the award to the 10000 soldiers in the un 
peacekeeping forces is the latest praise lavished on the world body 
un achievements include an iraniraq ceasefire an agreement 
on afghanistan peace plans for southern africa western sahara and 
cambodia and arranging talks between greek and turkish cypriots 
and this week the reagan administration made up with the united 
nations praising its work paying some long overdue debts and 
promising to pay up everything owed eventually 
the belated limited us donation will help but not solve un 
funding problems or finance the shopping list of new peacekeeping 
forces observers election monitors and other peacemakers being 
envisioned 
president reagan conceded monday in his seventh and final 
address to the general assembly that yes the united nations is a 
better place than it was eight years ago but so too is the world 
 
we see not only progress but also the potential for an 
increasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions 
like the united nations 
while giving high marks to patient un diplomacy most 
observers attribute its achievements to improved eastwest 
relations and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs desire to 
extricate his country from regional conflicts involving soviet 
troops and proxies 
the latest un victory came aug 20 after secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar arranged a ceasefire between iran and iraq 
and deployed 1500 peacekeepers observers and support personnel 
the un chief is conducting further talks with iran and iraq 
trying to consolidate the ceasefire and reach a lasting peace 
those talks appear likely to continue for a year or more 
the un success story began april 13 with the signing of the 
afghanistan agreement providing for withdrawal of more than 
100000 soviet troops it was negotiated over seven years of un 
mediation about 50 unarmed un observers were deployed to monitor 
the pullout and investigate violations 
in southern africa a 10yearold un independence plan for 
southwest africa or namibia is to be put into effect in november 
as part of a peace agreement among south africa angola and cuba 
at least 7000 un peacekeepers are likely to be required there 
in the western sahara representatives of morocco and the 
polisario independence movement accepted a un peace plan calling 
for elections in the region 
in southeast asia the secretarygeneral has proposed a peace 
plan and talks are under way among the cambodian and vietnamese 
factions 
most diplomatic observers expect that a un peacekeeping force 
will be needed in cambodia to monitor an eventual vietnamese troop 
withdrawal and to supervise elections 
on the cyprus problem the secretarygeneral brought 
representatives of greek and turkish communities together for the 
first time in three years in geneva last month and further talks 
about the divided island are plannned 
the recent achievements of the united nations have neither 
been sudden nor fortuitious perez de cuellar said thursday in a 
statement to the general assembly about the nobel prize 
they are the hardwon results of persistence and dedication 
over many years epitomized by the peacekeeping activities of the 
organization 
in his annual work report this month he said considering the 
vast sweep and scope of the possibilities now opening for 
constructive multilateral action through the united nations the 
financial health of the organization needs to be immediately 
restored 
he said the united nations is still seriously short of cash and 
reserves and without reserves it cannot mount new peacekeeping 
operations 
the present peacekeeping cost is 230 million a year and new 
operations are expected to raise the total annual bill to 15 
billion to 2 billion 
member states owe a total of about 484 million in peacekeeping 
arrears including about 70 million owed by the united states 
the arrears in the regular budget total about 593 million with 
the united states the largest contributor and debtor owing 
about 452 million of that washington promised to pay 188 million 
by the end of november and pay back the rest of its back dues over 
several years 
about 100 of the 159 un member states also are in arrears 
it would be paradoxical and discordant perez de cuellar 
said if the organization should face financial difficulties 
precisely when it has to meet the demands of a more constructive 
phase of international affairs

a year after the brunt of a violent 
earthquake hit this quiet los angeles suburb vacant lots gape 
many shops remain boarded up and homes are still undergoing repairs 
business operators and homeowners complain about the difficulty 
of getting loans to rebuild and at the same time earthquake 
repairs have generated business for some 
the quake struck at 742 am oct 1 1987 unleashed by a fault 
lurking 46000 feet beneath whittier narrows a flood control area 
10 miles east of downtown los angeles 
measuring 59 on the richter scale the shock spread scattered 
damage across more than 100 square miles but the greatest 
concentration of destruction was just to the south of the epicenter 
in the quaint uptown business district of whittier former 
president richard nixons boyhood home and surrounding 
neighborhoods 
brick stores collapsed windows showered sidewalks and roofs 
fell in walls split and street lights and merchandise crashed to 
the ground 
the tremor and a 53magnitude aftershock three days later 
caused 358 million in damage throughout metropolitan los angeles 
killed eight people and injured 200 
there were no deaths and few injuries among whittiers 71000 
residents but damage was severe enough to ensure that recovery 
will be a long process 
its going to take an estimated 10 to 20 years before the 
majority of the areas are rebuilt said sonny morkus city 
emergency services coordinator and director of personnel 
the towns structural damage amounted to 71 million in all 
4762 buildings were damaged including 80 businesses and more than 
300 residential units that had to be shuttered because they were 
hazardous 
about 36 of those 300 residences were razed and more may be 
morkus said thirty of the businesses have been demolished and 
others are awaiting the wreckers ball including a supermarket a 
theater and multistory department store 
were concerned about leaving them there because we are in 
earthquake country he said 
throughout uptown signs posted on empty lots and fences give 
addresses for relocated businesses offer to lease or announce 
rebuilding at this site atop one shattered building a stopped 
clock declares time to invest 
theres a lot of frustration said mimi campion 24 working 
behind a counter in a temporary trailer where the family business 
uptown mail amp parcel services reopened a month after the quake 
shattered its store 
were way down the only big period we had was christmas but 
even that was down 30 percent she said 
the trailer is among a dozen that the city allowed to be set up 
in parking lots some are vacant now but it will be months before 
they all are empty the parcel service hopes to open in a new 
building in march 
after the quake the federal emergency management agency and 
state office of emergency services set up centers for victims to 
apply for aid including lowinterest loans from the small business 
administration but theres a common feeling that loans arent as 
forthcoming as victims had expected 
the sba loans are whats fouling it up ms campion said 
a lot of people arent getting financed 
ironically interior designer paulette adams has seen her 
business grow 30 percent since the quake partly from people 
redoing their homes because they were damaged 
but she said government red tape kept her from getting any 
federal help for the damage to her own home and business she 
credits loyal customers understanding creditors good neighbors 
hard work and god for putting her back in business after a 
threemonth shutdown 
ms adams said she got a grant of several thousand dollars from 
the city but the sba would not loan her any amount her accountant 
estimated that producing the paperwork to get a federal loan would 
have cost at least 2000 she said 
i just said anything they said we dont care you dont 
have any income coming in ms adams said 
im totally frustrated with them the people who got money 
had money she said the red tape was unbelievable 
george camp sba deputy district director in sacramento took 
issue with assertions that the vacant lots remaining in the city 
are the result of rejected sba applications 
we do have to establish a reasonable assurance that the loan 
can be repayed he said 
the sba approved 8400 loan applications in the region for 
damage stemming from the quake for a total of 1496 million camp 
said the average was around 18000

president raul alfonsin the 
civilian who won office on a wave of popularity in 1983 after 
nearly eight years of military rule is seeing his support erode 
under an onslaught of inflation and unemployment 
eroding too is support for his radical civil union which must 
face the peronists in a presidential election in eight months 
inflation in august exceeded 25 percent for the second month in 
a row 
argentines have seen the value of their currency the austral 
plunge from 120 in 1985 to 7 cents now 
personal incomes have declined by 20 percent or more in the past 
12 months according to private estimates 
unemployment and underemployment at a combined 14 percent are 
the highest since 1974 
every day theres less work and my family cant live on what 
i earn said daniel rio a truck driver 
we make 200 a month said 33yearold school teacher alicia 
lupo converting her austral salary into dollars we want the 
government to spend more on education and pay higher salaries 
several colleagues nearby nodded in agreement 
tensions were vented dramatically sept 9 when fighting broke 
out among 20000 people demonstrating against austerity measures 
imposed by alfonsins government riot police used tear gas and 
water cannons to restore order more than 130 people were injured 
more and more argentines are blaming their misfortunes on 
alfonsin who until recently appeared immune from the criticism 
aimed at members of his cabinet 
the 61yearold president was booed when he inaugurated the 
nations annual livestock fair in august shouting above his 
hecklers an angered alfonsin decried their fascist attitudes 
hardly a week goes by that some group doctors nurses 
teachers mail carriers train engineers does not strike to 
demand pay increases the 35millionmember general labor 
confederation staged general strikes on sept 9 and 12 
the first was to protest the hunger and misery the government 
is trying to impose on us said saul ubaldini the 
confederations leader the second he said was to denounce the 
unusual and ferocious attack on demonstrators by riot police at 
the first 
argentines of all classes have had to make concessions they 
wash clothes at home instead of sending them to the cleaners the 
customary weekly movie and dinner out have become biweekly people 
take buses and the subway instead of taxis 
that irritates taxi driver juan de la larramendi 
the alfonsin government is the worst ive seen he said 
he says everything is ok but its not nobody has any money how 
can they take a cab i guess my business is off 40 percent since 
last year 
prices have risen 20 to 30 percent in the past month beefsteak 
always cheap in this cattleraising and agricultural nation has 
risen to the equivalent of 1 a pound a quart of milk is up to 64 
cents a movie ticket to 165 and a bus token to 17 cents 
the monthly minimum wage is 924 australs 66 a secretary 
might earn the equivalent of 150 a month an engineer 400 a 
bilingual college graduate with a degree in business administration 
500 and a tenured university professor 600 to 700 a month 
many argentines have taken second jobs and shoppers are buying 
cheaper cuts of meat some buy lentils instead of meat and more 
flour to bake bread and cookies at home 
ovidio bolo president of the argentine chamber of supermarkets 
said total sales at member stores have dropped 10 to 15 percent 
since july new car sales dropped 15 percent in august according 
to the association of automobile manufacturers 
many argentines line up on pay day at banks and foreign exchange 
houses to buy us dollars or certificates of deposit cds as 
hedges against inflation in july banks offered onemonth cds with 
a 27percent interest rate 
with an eye to the national elections set for may alfonsin 
devalued the austral in august to spur exports and discourage 
imports and financial speculation he also implemented voluntary 
wage and price controls cut government spending and made plans to 
borrow abroad 
the government currently is negotiating with international 
lending institutions for 5 billion to finance development projects 
or structural reforms and to help pay interest on argentinas 56 
billion foreign debt through the end of 1989 
preliminary results from the antiinflation plan have been 
positive shortterm interest rates have declined the austral has 
stabilized against the dollar and prices appear to be increasing 
less rapidly 
but organized labor and the opposition peronist party say the 
measures are forcing workers to bear the brunt of the hardship by 
accepting reduced purchasing power or being laid off 
union leader ubaldini said high unemployment is not a natural 
cataclysm that is impossible to predict or control it is the fruit 
of a perverse socioeconomic policy that benefits financial 
interests and speculators ahead of the common good the dignity of 
man and the necessities of the family 
no independent polls have been published as yet on how voters 
feel about the presidential candidates the radical civic unions 
eduardo angeloz and the peronists carlos menem two provincial 
governors nominated in july 
but the trend appears to favor the peronists 
votes for the radicals dropped from to 59 million in 
congressional and provincial elections in september 1987 from 71 
million in the national elections that sent alfonsin to the 
presidency in 1983 
votes for the peronists who now control 17 of argentinas 22 
provinces increased to 66 million last year from 57 million in 
1983

the soviet union has been working 
quietly during the olympics to create a good image in this strongly 
anticommunist nation 
the soviets got an early start in their publicity campaign when 
they sent the bolshoi ballet the moscow philharmonic and an ethnic 
korean singer to seoul to perform in a cultural festival that 
preceded the sports competitions 
the performances were followed by nelli kim the former soviet 
gymnastic star of korean descent who came with the soviet athletes 
as a goodwill ambassador and gymnastics judge 
kim and some other ethnic koreans who were allowed to visit 
south korea for the first time were received with open arms 
the soviet union and south korea have no formal diplomatic or 
trade relations so the novelty of soviet visitors fanned the 
publics interest 
korean television devoted segments of nightly newscasts to the 
soviets showing kims activities interviews with a correspondent 
of the official communist party newspaper pravda and a visit to a 
typical korean family by reporters of the tass soviet news agency 
at a preliminary olympic soccer match between the united states 
and the soviet union last week some koreans cheered for the soviet 
side waving huge hammerandsickle red flags a scene almost 
impossible to imagine only a few months ago 
koreans also held up signs reading cccp the russian 
letters for ussr during the mens basketball game between the 
soviet union and the united states on wednesday the soviets upset 
the americans 8276 
korean media have mentioned a strong possibility of expanding 
cultural and commercial exchanges with the soviet union 
but despite the new developments relations between the south 
korean government and the soviet union are likely to remain cool 
because moscow supports communist north korea 
in addition south korea remains a firm ally of the united 
states which supported in the war with the north in the 1950s that 
divided the korean peninsula about 42000 american troops are 
stationed in the south

in critical condition thursday 
one of the victims was 16yearold football player bernard

front door

a massive undersea current and earthquakes on 
the floor of the pacific ocean may be related to the el nino a 
periodic climate change that can disrupt weather around the world 
according to a pair of new studies 
scientists at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration reported thursday that the huge current flowing 
beneath the surface of the pacific may have signaled the end of the 
198687 el nino 
the american geophysical union meanwhile published a report 
which it acknowledged was controversial disclosing an apparent 
relationship between el nino and seafloor earthquakes 
the term el nino refers to a complex series of atmospheric and 
ocean events that occur every two to seven years it attracted 
widespread attention in 198283 when the phenomena disrupted 
weather patterns around the world it was eventually blamed for 
1500 deaths and damage ranging from 2 billion to 8 billion 
that however was the strongest el nino of this century most 
fit the much milder pattern seen in 198687 when some weather 
changes were noted but little major damage was done 
the disruptions of 198283 included a worsening of africas 
deadly drought severe winter storms in california reduced fish 
catch in south america australias worst drought in 200 years 
heavy rainfalls i peru and ecuador and the first typhoon to hit 
french polynesia in 75 years followed by five more in five months 
scientists measure the arrival and departure of an el nino 
pronounced elneenyo by changes in ocean surface temperatures 
along the west coast of south america and changes in the air 
pressure differential between northern australia and the central or 
eastern pacific 
falling air pressure at easter island tends to be a good 
indicator of an el nino according to an analysis by daniel a 
walker of the university of hawaii 
his findings reported in the american geophysical unions 
weekly periodical eos found a correlation between that air 
pressure drop and increases in seafloor earthquakes in the easter 
island region 
the article was published with our recognition that it 
presents controversial material even the possibility of 
linkages here should be of interest to both geophysicists and 
oceanographers wrote eos oceanography editor robin d muench 
increased earthquake activity occurred at about the same time as 
the el ninos of 1965 197677 and 198687 and just ahead of the el 
ninos of 197273 and 198283 walker found 
while he doesnt draw any conclusions about cause and effect 
walker points out that the likelihood of these things occurring 
together by chance is one out of 313 cases 
and he notes that the seafloor fractures in the easter island 
region which tend to generate the earthquakes vent large amounts of 
heat into the ocean 
if this heat were enough to warm the waters above it could help 
generate rising air currents reducing the normal air pressure in 
the region some scientists have been skeptical about this 
possibility however 
meanwhile michael mcphaden of noaas pacific marine 
environmental laboratory in seattle reported on the interruption 
of the equatorial undercurrent in the pacific ocean 
under normal conditions westwardblowing winds push the water 
at the oceans surface to the west and that flow is balanced by 
water moving easterly in a current about 175 miles wide about 150 
to 800 feet beneath the sea surface 
when an el nino occurs the trade winds weaken however the 
surface water flow eases up and thus the balancing deepsea current 
does too mcphaden found 
that occurred in 1986 and 1987 he reports indeed for a time 
the undersea flow of water even was reversed according to data 
collected from moored instruments 
perhaps the origins of el ninos demise may be found in the 
weak winds which typify it at its peak mcphaden speculated 
this current moves a volume of as much as 800 million gallons of 
water a second and climate experts have pointed out that the heat 
from warm ocean water has major impacts on the worlds climate

early in his vice presidential campaign sen 
dan quayle was challenged by a reporter to show he understood 
target prices a keystone of us farm commodity programs 
his halting somewhat defensive answer went like this 
target prices how that works i know quite a bit about farm 
policy i come from indiana which is a farm state deficiency 
payments which are the key that is what gets money into the 
farmers hands we got loan rates we got target prices 
aides to quayle quickly hustled the republican vice presidential 
nominee away before the matter could be pursued further 
they concede privately that there are areas where he needs to 
bone up namely on agricultural and economic issues but they point 
out that on defense and national security quayle considers himself 
an expert not without reason 
his democratic counterpart sen lloyd bentsen of texas has 
spent 18 years in the senate and is considered quite knowledgeable 
on a number of issues particularly in his work on the senate 
finance committee he chairs 
but both vice presidential nominees need and get extensive 
briefings as they stump throughout the country not only on 
regional issues but also on positions enunciated by their 
respective running mates 
the briefings have intensified as the two candidates prepare for 
their debate wednesday in omaha neb 
quayle devoted thursday to debate preparation and looked ahead 
to a weekend of tutelage from roger ailes the bush campaigns 
media adviser bentsen snatched time to study during a light 
campaign schedule before returning to washington late friday for 
two days of meetings and briefings with top democratic advisers 
quayle has been studying briefing papers on various issues 
prepared for him under the supervision of jim ciccone a former 
aide to bush campaign chairman james a baker iii ciccone is 
quayles issues and research director 
the day on the road begins with a meeting of quayles senior 
staff and consultation with campaign headquarters in washington 
the staff then briefs the senator on the days schedule and current 
news quayle himself reads some newspapers but mostly relies on 
oral staff briefings for information throughout the day aides 
keep in touch with the washington office or with quayles senate 
office to research anything new that may come up 
papers or speeches are transmitted via fax machine at the hotel 
where the campaign stays each night or are reviewed by the 
respective presidential campaigns by telephone a system bentsens 
staff also uses 
bentsen receives extensive briefings by a group of people mostly 
from the dukakis campaign when hes in washington usually on 
monday before he heads out 
each morning on the road hes briefed again victoria radd who 
worked with michael dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas on the 
team that picked bentsen for the ticket outlines for the senator 
dukakis positions on the issues 
the campaign brings in specialists for whatever issue or 
political situation is developing that day for example bentsens 
finance committee expert on health programs was on board on a 
recent trip in which bentsen announced a rural health program 
larry harrington the dukakisbentsen southern coordinator travels 
with bentsen when hes in the south 
both senators often pick up a senate colleague when theyre in a 
particular area to fill them in on important local issues sen 
david boren dokla rode the plane with bentsen on the way to 
oklahoma city for example and sen bob kasten rwis traveled 
with quayle to milwaukee area events 
neither bentsen nor quayle holds many news conferences these 
days but if there is to be a press availability quayles staff 
runs him through some possible questions 
we just try and anticipate issues and questions and make sure 
hes got something to say said david prosperi quayles 
spokesman 
when quayle is unprepared his comments can come out garbled 
like his response on target prices at the missouri state fair 
which actually came close to the mark without being a lucid 
explanation 
joe oneill bentsens traveling chief of staff says that there 
is no comparable effort to program the texas senator 
we dont tell him theres a question thats going to be 
asked and heres your answer theres none of that he says 
in matters of defense and national security quayle can end up 
briefing his staff based on his senate armed services committee 
experience 
when a reporter asked how many warheads a soviet ss25 mobile 
intercontinental ballistic missile was capable of carrying quayle 
not his staff knew the answer it has been tested with up to 
three 
but such knowledge is arcane not necessarily riveting stuff to 
the voters more often than not it is quayles apparent lack of 
knowledge in a certain area that gets headlines 
quayle confounded reporters at a billings mont news 
conference when he appeared not to know that not all states 
restricted gun sales convicted felons cant just walk into a 
store and buy a gun there are all sorts of restrictions there are 
all sorts of state laws he said 
in a newspaper interview quayle said he did not know that bush 
was in charge of a major federal program to fight drugs a program 
quayle himself would head if he becomes vice president 
quayles aides say he is doing better and they note that he has 
had to get used to a national campaign vastly different from a home 
state race both in the pace of events and the depth of the 
inquiry as a senior campaign official put it 
themes and issues are changing hourly here said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity nobody knows more 
than sen quayle how rigorous the inspection of things large and 
small can be

the next move in the weapons case against 
syndicated columnist carl t rowan is up to prosecutors after a 
jury was unable to decide if he should be convicted for using an 
unregistered handgun to shoot a teenage intruder in his back yard 
district of columbia superior court judge arthur l burnett sr 
declared a mistrial in the case thursday after the 12member panel 
had spent more than seven fruitless hours over two days in search 
of a verdict 
prosecutors now must decide whether to conduct another trial 
before a new jury claude bailey a spokesman for the citys top 
attorney said no decision had been made yet on that question 
one juror who declined to be identified said the panels last 
vote was 93 in favor of acquittal a unanimous verdict was 
required 
jury foreman william c bartee 66 said he saw barrels of 
reasonable doubt and that before i would have given over to the 
proconviction side i would have waded through hell barefoot 
from now until christmas 
rowan would not comment after the ruling but his attorney 
raoul carroll noted the possibility of another trial saying 
weve still got a way to go 
rowan 63 was charged with using an unregistered handgun and 
ammunition to shoot a teenager who had taken an unauthorized dip 
in his swimming pool conviction on the weapons charges is 
punishable by up to two years in prison and a 2000 fine 
the columnist shot 18yearold benjamin smith in the wrist after 
he found smith and several other youths in his back yard in the 
predawn hours of june 14 police had just arrived in front of the 
house when rowan shot the teenager 
my mind is pretty clear as to whether or not he had an 
unregistered weapon because he shot me with it and theres not a 
whole lot of confusion about that smith told wrctv from 
massachusetts where he goes to college 
im not gonna go pool hopping again he said when asked what 
lessons he had learned from the incident i cant understand what 
would motivate him to go ahead and get his saturday night special 
loaded and slip out the back door and shoot me with the police 
right around the corner i just cant understand it 
the defense built its case around a littleused legal principle 
called entrapment by estoppel the principle holds that a 
person cannot be convicted for following advice given by government 
officials 
rowan testified that his son carl jr a former fbi agent was 
repeatedly rebuffed by police officials when he tried to register 
the 22caliber revolver used in the shooting 
rowans son also testified that police told him others in his 
family could have access to the gun as well 
he carl jr was depending upon the competence and 
intelligence of those people that the district of columbia put 
there carroll argued during the trial he was entirely at the 
mercy of the district of columbia 
rowan who is black testified that he was given the weapon by 
his son in 1982 after receiving a series of death threats from 
people purporting to be members of the ku klux klan 
perhaps mindful of the charges of hypocrisy leveled at him 
because of the strong antigun stance in his own writings the 
columnist told the jury that he had not easily arrived at a 
decision to arm himself 
i had never had a gun in this house rowan said we rowan 
and his son got into a little hassle about how sometimes you can 
let your idealism go so far that you get killed 
prosecutors contended however that rowan simply was not 
authorized to handle a weapon not registered to him 
we are here simply because the handgun is not registered 
prosecutor thomas c collier told the court the death threats 
the shooting and the issue of trespassing have nothing to do with 
this case 
rowan maintained that he shot smith because he was afraid the 
intruder was trying to enter the house smith said he was trying to 
flee when rowan shot him

look out theater buffs london ticket prices are 
going up 
thats the unfortunate truth in the british capital a city that 
has long been an attraction in part because of its relatively low 
ticket costs 
last weeks opening of sugar babies the burlesque musical 
that was a longrunning hit on broadway set a new london top price 
of 22 pounds 37 
drama and comedy which only two or three years ago had a price 
ceiling of 17 or so now routinely cost up to 25 
even the governmentsubsidized sector whose prices have 
traditionally trailed the commercial west end is following suit 
top tickets at the national theater and the royal shakespeare co 
in london are 23 and 25 respectively and prices at the 
companys home theater in stratforduponavon run as high as 46 
for each of 20 superseats billed as the best in the house 
its market forces william wilkinson the royal shakespeare 
cos financial controller told the associated press 
its a combination of the availability of funding and what the 
general market trends are he said explaining that the company 
must compensate for dwindling government subsidies with increased 
box office revenue 
david martin the producer of sugar babies said having 
mickey rooney and ann miller as the shows two stars justified the 
ticket price 
we have two of the highestpaid theatrical performers in the 
world and the only way to bring them to the west end was to 
charge those prices martin said of rooney and miller who won 
local raves for their performances 
he said the leads had the highest combined salaries ever seen on 
the west end martin said their pay represented about onethird of 
the weekly running cost which he put in the range of about 140000 
as is the case on broadway one ticket increase tends to trigger 
increases across the board and martin said he expected other 
musicals soon to begin charging 2250 pounds 38 
while these prices are well below the 55 broadway high set by 
the upcoming musical built around jerome robbins choreography 
they still represent a hefty bite of the paycheck in a city where 
salaries are generally lower than in new york 
but london continues to offer a greater variety of discounts 
than broadway in addition to a halfprice ticket booth like the 
one in new york londoners can take advantage of student and senior 
citizen discounts standby seats and day seats specifically set 
aside to be sold on the day of performance 
price ranges are also wider the royal shakespeare co in 
stratford for example offers balcony seats for as little as 750 
a move that financial controller wilkinson said balanced out the 
superseat prices 
he said the higher ticket costs did not bother him as long as 
we have a sufficient number of seats at the lower end of the 
spectrum for people who cant afford the top tickets

the glow of four superpower summits may be 
bright enough to last through the less than four months remaining 
in the reagan administration but discord over afghanistan could 
snuff it out 
the soviets are hinting if pakistan allows the training and 
arming of guerrillas from its territory to continue the red armys 
withdrawal could come to a screeching halt 
state department officials are inclined to believe the dispute 
will not come to that but gennady gerasimov the soviet foreign 
ministry spokesman warned at a news conference here on thursday 
that if the flagrant violations continue the consequences could 
be unpredictable 
we dont want to be specific he said but everybody assumed 
he meant a suspension of the troop withdrawal or possibly a 
widening of the war 
before flying to moscow for a communist party plenum soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze asked un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar for a detailed 
investigation of the soviet complaint 
secretary of state george p shultz meanwhile registered his 
own complaint that the soviets and the afghan government were 
violating the geneva accords of last april by bombing pakistani 
territory 
he suggested wednesday evening in a meeting with perez de 
cuellar shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of britain china 
and france that the un observers were the appropriate mechanism to 
conduct an investigation 
gerasimov accused the un observers of an inadequate job on the 
very day the 9991 un peacekeepers operating in seven regional hot 
spots around the world had been awarded the nobel peace prize in 
celebration of their global mission 
a further irony is that the soviets do not contribute 
financially to the peacekeeping operation 
apart from the impact on ussoviet relations gerasimov hinted 
that the soviets might undercut the entire peacekeeping operation 
which as a permanent member of the un security council they have 
the power to do 
if we do not succeed in creating an efficient control 
mechanism here in afghanistan which is kind of a testing ground 
then we will have difficulties in creating this kind of mechanism 
in other conflicts he said 
the grim look on the faces of shultz and shevardnadze and us 
ambassador vernon walters as they left the secretariat building 
after the meeting wednesday evening was a tipoff how serious the 
dispute has become 
shultz and shevardnadze have worked hard and successfully to 
repair ussoviet relations over the last three years 
they ironed out the differences that had blocked completion of a 
treaty to abolish us and soviet groundlaunched 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles and they succeeded in 
resolving regional tensions 
the geneva accords providing for the withdrawal of the more 
than 100000 soviet troops in afghanistan were the product of a 
ussoviet reconciliation 
but now completion of that withdrawal may be in doubt 
gerasimov said pakistan armed the afghan guerrillas and was 
allowing at least two training camps to operate on its territory 
for about 3400 fighters 
he said 2500 afghan fighters were in training near islamabad 
the pakistani capital and 900 others at a base near the afghan 
border with the assistance of chinese american and pakistani 
advisers 
gerasimov also accused pakistani authorities of patrolling 
refugee camps to stop afghans from returning to their homeland 
with both the soviets and the americans looking to the united 
nations for a solution the dispute is shaping up as an acid test 
of the nobel prize winners

the battle over who will succeed 
87yearold john c stennis to the us senate has been punctuated 
with cries of let george go a reference to the man paid 
50000 a year to chauffer and protect house minority whip trent 
lott in washington 
democrat wayne dowdy launched his campaign against lott by 
focusing on the employee george awkward whose salary is almost 
five times the average farm income and more than three times the 
average family income in this dirtpoor state 
in his bid to retain a senate seat for the democrats dowdy has 
urged lott to let george go and said that before we cut 
services to our senior citizens in mississippi lets cut george 
to combat the dowdy campaign lott has reminded his democratic 
opponent and house colleague that funds for the bodyguards 
accorded most of the congressional leadership were in a bill 
dowdy voted for and lott opposed 
further awkward was featured in a lott television commercial 
pointedly telling the democrat mr dowdy im nobodys 
chauffeur got it 
but beyond a squabble over perks in the nations capital is a 
deeper struggle between two young veteran politicians of markedly 
different philosophies whoever is elected an era in mississippi 
politics will end 
there has been only one new us senator elected in mississippi 
since 1947 when stennis won election the late sen james o 
eastland also a democrat preceded stennis in the senate by five 
years 
when eastland retired in 1978 republican thad cochran was 
elected as the states first gop senator since reconstruction 
lott from the conservative 5th congressional district in southern 
mississippi is hoping stennis retirement a decade later due to 
declining health will give him the same chance to advance 
lott was elected in 1972 to succeed his onetime employer on 
capitol hill the late rep william colmer when the democrat 
retired the 46yearold lawyer was elected minority whip in 1980 
as a member of the house judiciary committee in his first term 
lott staunchly defended richard nixon during his impeachment 
hearings the exposure pushed lott to the leadership of the 
conservative wing of the republican party 
lott voted for the 1986 tax reform act and has repeatedly voted 
for aid to the contra and angola rebels he also has voted to put 
limits on the clean water act against efforts to limit star wars 
funding and against sanctions against the whiteminority government 
of south africa 
despite his strict conservative voting record he has preferred 
to stress while campaigning his backing of employment and economic 
development programs in general terms 
dowdy has sharply criticized lott for voting to cut funding for 
social programs including votes on social securty medicaid 
welfare issues all of which provide support for a large number of 
poor mississippians both black and white 
the republican has countered that when the chips were down 
that is in final consideration of legislation he successfully 
fought efforts to bail out the budget by using social security 
funds the record appears to bear that out 
dowdy was a folksy smalltown mayor in mccomb when he was voted 
into congress in a closely fought special election he was the 
first democrat elected to that post since 1972 
the 45yearold dowdys congressional district is dominated by 
the capital city of jackson a republican stronghold for decades 
but the rural sections of the southwestern part of the state with 
their large black voting population propelled dowdy to 
reelections in 1982 1984 and 1986 
lott has tried to pin on dowdy the label of a tax and spend 
liberal he has cited dowdy for what he has called a liberal voting 
record and for his votes against reagan administration efforts to 
reduce federal spending 
at the neshoba county fair in philadelphia miss lott asked a 
crowd whether they wanted a senator that is going to follow in 
the line of mcgovern mondale oneill wright jackson and 
dukakis 
dowdys voting record generally has followed party lines he 
voted against the reagan tax cut and against on limits on the clean 
water act he also voted for sanctions against the south african 
government and for aid to the contra rebels and for limits on the 
star wars program he was against aid to the angola rebels

the soviets charged that un peacekeeping 
forces in afghanistan were failing in their mission hours after the 
peacekeepers popped champagne corks to celebrate their nobel peace 
prize 
several western leaders including president reagan who was 
himself in the running for the prize praised the decision to award 
it to un peacekeepers worldwide 
un leaders said they too were delighted with the award 
announced thursday but they also pleaded for the release of a us 
marine kidnapped while serving with a peacekeeping group in lebanon 
spokesman gennady gerasimov of the soviet foreign ministry said 
thursday that un peacekeeping forces in afghanistan are not 
doing their job properly he said they should be investigated by 
the head of the united nations before any future peacekeeping 
forces are approved 
if we do not succeed in creating an efficient control 
mechanism here in afghanistan which is kind of a testing ground 
then we will have difficulties in creating this kind of mechanism 
in other conflicts said gerasimov 
up to 500000 people have worn the blue helmet or beret of the 
un peacekeeping forces and 9991 soldiers now are in the force 
supported by about 2000 civilian personnel a total of 733 have 
died on missions 
the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the un 
security council met wednesday at the request of soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to discuss soviet claims that the 
united states and pakistan are violating the afghan accords signed 
in geneva on april 14 
those accords call for the soviets to withdraw more than 100000 
troops from afghanistan and for afghanistan and pakistan to respect 
each others territorial integrity 
humayun khan pakistani secretary of state for foreign affairs 
said thursday in islamabad that it was the kabul government not 
his own that had violated the accords he said he expected the 
soviet union to withdraw from afghanistan as scheduled 
the soviet union has been bolstering a marxist government in 
afghanistan and pakistan and the united states have backed 
antigovernment rebels 
gerasimov also said that at the meeting of the security council 
foreign ministers we drew the attention of the ministers and of 
the un secretarygeneral perez de cuellar to the flagrant 
violations by pakistan of the geneva accords and said that the 
consequences of these actions may be unpredictable 
in new delhi india on thursday soviet ambassadoratlarge 
nicolai kozyrev said pakistani violations include supplying rebels 
with longrange missiles for bombarding kabul and preventing afghan 
refugees from returning home 
on tuesday shevardnaze said the soviets had finished the first 
part of their troop withdrawal but had not yet begun the second 
phase he said they would wait to see if the alleged violations 
were halted 
un observers have confirmed that half the soviet troops 
withdrew by aug 15 so shevardnadzes statement meant the red army 
retreat has been halted for the last six weeks the withdrawal 
began may 15 and is to be complete by feb 15 1989 
meanwhile thursdays nobel decision was praised by french 
president francois mitterrand british foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe and reagan soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
reagan were in the running for the december 1987 agreement to 
eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons 
un leaders lauded their peacekeeping forces after the prize 
was announced thursday but pleaded for the release of lt col 
william r higgins 
higgins commanded a 76man group attached to the un interim 
force in lebanon when he was abducted feb 17 
for us it is a no 1 priority that this officer who was 
serving the united nations who was wearing the blue beret when he 
was kidnapped should be released without delay said marrack 
goulding who leads the peacekeepers as un undersecretary for 
political affairs 
the proiranian organization of the oppressed on earth claimed 
responsibility and said higgins would be put on trial for spying 
us and un sources deny higgins was a spy 
gouldings call for higgins release was the only somber note 
sounded by un staff 
everybody from the 38th floor to the basement is delighted

swedish army maj wilbert algotson was 
39 when he packed his wife and two small children into the family 
car and drove off to the battlefield to a war not his own 
the algotsons headed for central asia where he helped supervise 
the indiapakistan ceasefire as a un observer 
fifteen years later the 36man un observer group in india and 
pakistan is still on duty along the disputed jammukashmir 
frontier and algotson along with thousands like him has a small 
share of the nobel peace prize for 1988 
the prize was awarded thursday to the united nations 
peacekeeping forces 
algotson will never see any of the 390000 in prize money but 
in a telephone interview he sounded satisfied all the same 
im very pleased and also proud of having been part of it 
he said 
an army veteran algotson like all other un peacekeepers 
volunteered for the job in neutral countries like sweden and 
finland which regularly contribute men and money to peacekeeping 
efforts such duty is usually the only chance to see action 
i knew it could be dangerous too there were still exchanges 
of fire over the line of control in spite of the peace accord 
after the bangladesh war he said 
at that time in 1973 making the drive was a popular thing to 
do for the finns danes swedes and other europeans on the force 
he said it was partly for the adventure partly because of the 
money involved 
algotson was entitled to an airline ticket for himself but not 
his family so driving was the most economical way to get there 
the policy has become more generous in recent years 
the plan he said was to do his job along the ceasefire line 
while his family lived in rawalpindi pakistan 
getting there was trouble enough the drive took them through 
europe turkey iran afghanistan and pakistan in afghanistan a 
french family traveling ahead of them was murdered during an 
overnight stop 
during his oneyear tour algotson served in several field 
stations along the dividing line between hostile indian and 
pakistani troops 
we were out for three to four weeks with the indian or 
pakistani units and then had a week or so off he said 
after a year he and his family drove back to sweden algotson 
said he felt that people at home were interested and felt 
positively about the united nations and its work 
he said there were a few extra allowances but on the whole 
financial rewards were few 
my economy took a slight turn for the better but at that time 
the state didnt pay for the family or for home leaves so all in 
all it probably was about the same he said 
the 1988 nobel peace prize choice was well motivated since 
everyone enlists to serve peace algotson said 
it would be very troubling if the un role became so weak 
that this working process was no longer possible 
algotson said it was gratifying to know that he helped prevent 
the spread of a regional war but of the conflict itself i see 
no end to it he said 
at 54 and still on army duty algotson said he was considering 
volunteering again 
if something comes up in namibia i might go for it he said 
un officials are considering sending a peacekeeping force to 
namibia or southwest africa pending successful negotiations 
between south africa and angola

french president francois mitterrand says a 
paris conference proposed by president reagan to tighten a ban on 
chemical weapons could be held in three months 
mitterrand said the idea of a special conference to improve 
enforcement of the 110nation ban was one of a range of issues he 
discussed with reagan in meetings at the white house on thursday 
mitterrand also spoke separately with vice president george bush 
and his democratic rival in the presidential campaign michael 
dukakis he called both discussions excellent 
hubert vedrine spokesman for mitterrand told french reporters 
that the discussion between reagan and the french president 
included a discussion of developments in the soviet union 
reagan said it was hard for gorbachev to carry out his 
policies but he has the means to continue said vedrine 
but at his news conference mitterrand declined to give his 
views on the hastily called meeting of the central committee of the 
soviet communist party and other developments in the soviet union 
in a speech thursday morning to the united nations mitterrand 
pushed for movement on disarmament and a worldwide ban on the 
production of chemical weapons he met for 45 minutes with reagan 
in the afternoon and returned in the evening for a private dinner 
he noted that there have been discussions for several days on 
holding a conference to improve enforcement of the ban on chemical 
weapons in view of allegations that iraq has been violating the 
accord 
its true that it was president reagan who asked me about the 
possibility of having the conference in paris and my answer was of 
course in the affirmative mitterrand said 
asked whether such a conference could be held soon he said 
if by soon you mean say within three months time the answer 
would be yes i think it would at any rate be a possibility im 
not saying it would be a probability 
he said he imagined reagan would be happy to take part in the 
conference but that his participation would not be a consideration 
in fixing a date for the session 
in his un speech mitterrand called for creating a situation 
which would make it impossible for any state to use chemical 
weapons with impunity to settle its external or internal problems 
and suggested increasing the role of the united nations in 
enforcing the ban 
france would be ready to join in an embargo on all deliveries 
of products technologies and more generally weapons to any 
offending country he said 
and he said the world should also prohibit not only the use 
but also the manufacture of chemical weapons 
mitterrand said reagan asked him what he thought were the most 
urgent problems to be attacked and that he responded first third 
world debt and second lebanons civil unrest but he did not go 
into detail at the news conference 
the day began for mitterrand began with his 40minute meeting 
with dukakis in new york spokesman vedrine said the democratic 
candidate spent most of his time asking questions 
the staffs of mitterrand and bush had been unable to find a time 
when both could meet so they had a discussion by telephone 
vedrine said 
the french president asked for his impressions of dukakis said 
they are excellent and i had a phone call this evening from mr 
bush and if you asked me the same question i would say very 
good 
asked whether he had a preference he said i will wait and 
see the preference of the americans

honduras denied a report in a 
nicaraguan progovernment newspaper that honduran aircraft drew 
fire while penetrating nicaraguan airspace 
the reports are totally false armed forces spokesman juan 
sierra fonseca said on thursday he called the reports alarming 
because they generate tensions in central america 
barricada the newspaper of nicaraguas governing sandinista 
party said on wednesday that nicaraguan troops fired artillery and 
rockets at honduran military aircraft in nicaraguan airspace near 
the border it said the honduran planes were not hit 
a nicaraguan defense ministry spokesman speaking on condition 
of anonymity said honduras which is a key us ally in central 
america provoked nicaraguan troops into shooting at the 
aircraft 
barricada also said the defense ministry reported two shooting 
incidents tuesday between nicaraguan and honduran troops it said 
honduran troops harassed two nicaraguan border observation 
posts with 50 and 60caliber machinegun fire 
eugenio castro spokesman for the foreign ministry denied the 
barricada reports and called them absurd 
barricada said a helicopter gunship and an f5 fighter jet from 
the honduran air force and a twinengine plane without 
identification recently flew over the border towns of santo tomas 
del nance san pedro de potrero grande and somotillo it did not 
say when the incident took place 
the report quoted maj leonel martinez military commander for 
chinandega and leon provinces in nicaragua as saying sandinista 
soldiers fired artillery shells and rockets at the intruders but 
failed to hit them 
barricada said the incident heightened the possibility of a 
military confrontation between honduras and leftist nicaragua 
honduras has permitted usbacked nicaraguan rebels known as 
contras to use its territory to launch attacks against sandinista 
forces 
the bulk of contra forces holed up in camps inside honduras 
after us military aid for the rebels ended in february and a 
truce in the 7yearold civil war began in march 
martinez said the navy sank six honduran boats trying to enter 
nicaraguan waters in the gulf of fonseca on aug 20 but that a 
sandinista army officer lt pablo blanco torres died in the 
incident the gulf is shared by honduras nicaragua and el salvador 
barricada quoted another regional military commander col 
carlos brenes as saying contras have tried to cross into nicaragua 
near the town of palo grande in chinandega province 
brenes was quoted as saying honduran troops have been harassing 
the border post at palo grande to provide cover for contras 
sneaking into nicaragua from honduras he also was quoted as saying 
that the hondurans have increased their troop strength in the area 
he said the sandinista army has not responded with any unusal 
military mobilization according to barricada

an explosion in the gas compressor of a north sea 
oil rig apparently sparked an inferno that killed 167 people in the 
worlds worst oilfield disaster a government report said 
the explosion probably ruptured pipelines carrying hydrocarbon 
gases setting off a series of blasts and fires that incinerated 
the piper alpha rig owned by los angelesbased occidental petroleum 
corp said the report released by the department of energy on 
thursday 
the first explosions aboard piper alpha just before 10 pm july 
6 seem to have severed electrical power and disabled control and 
communications facilities the report said 
threequarters of the platform sank to the ocean floor 120 miles 
off scotlands eastern coast trapping many of the victims two 
wouldbe rescuers were among the dead 
the department of energys director of safety jim petrie who 
is heading the technical inquiry into the disaster announced that 
safety regulations for oil rig operators would be tightened 
among areas that needed closer attention were oil companies 
technical procedures for dealing with oilfield emergencies and 
their firefighting and evacuation systems he said 
the government recommended last month that additional safety 
valves be installed on offshore oil and gas rigs to disconnect the 
flow of fuel to work areas in the event of an explosion 
currently there are no regulations concerning the locations of 
valves although all rigs have some types of valves 
most of the 120 men still missing are believed to have been 
trapped in the sunken living quarters occidental petroleum said it 
hopes to lift the accommodation modules to the surface early next 
month 
a public inquiry will open nov 11 in aberdeen scotland and 
the technical inquiry will continue separately as long as its 
necessary to get to the facts said a department of energy 
spokesman 
this is not the final report and much remains to be done 
said energy secretary cecil parkinson a number of studies have 
been commissioned and the results are yet to be received 
the opposition labor partys spokesman on energy john prescott 
said safety legislation rather than voluntary agreements with oil 
companies was needed urgently 
the offshore oil industry is the most dangerous industry in 
britain he charged its safety standards are being compromised 
to maximize production and profit

president jose napoleon duarte 
said death squads could return to his wartorn country after a 
rightist leader warned of renewed guerrilla war if the right fails 
to win presidential elections 
duarte was responding to comments made tuesday by legislator 
sigifrido ochoa perez of the rightwing party republican 
nationalist alliance or arena 
ochoa a retired army colonel predicted rightist guerrilla 
groups might form to fight duartes christian democrats if arena 
is deprived of its rightful victory in presidential elections 
next march 
someone asked me if it was true that if we did not win the 
election we would resort to nationalist guerrilla warfare and i 
say a frustrated people could do just that ochoa said 
duarte said the comment demonstrates ochoas violent mentality 
and how little he believes in democracy 
they arena still believe in imposing themselves by force 
duarte said by speaking of rightist guerrilla struggle what he 
really is saying is that they have to reactivate the death squads 
and that is grave 
duarte spoke with journalists thursday at ilopango airport 
outside the capital following a skydiving exhibition to mark 
paratrooper day 
local and international human rights groups blame rightwing 
death squads for the abduction and summary execution of thousands 
of suspected leftists in the early 1980s the human rights groups 
and the government say roberto daubuisson arenas founder 
masterminded the death squad campaign 
daubuisson currently a legislator denies the accusations 
arena trounced the christian democrats in legislative and 
municipal elections last march taking control of the unicameral 
legislature the rightists are favored by most to win the 
presidential race 
duarte 62 is prohibited by the constitution from seeking 
another term and has been diagnosed as having liver cancer 
the defense minister gen carlos vides casanova also at 
ilopango said he saw little possibility of rightist guerrilla 
warfare but added whether guerrilla struggle comes from the left 
or the right the government must be prepared to combat violence 
a 9yearold civil war pitting leftist guerrillas against the 
usbacked government has killed an estimated 65000 people most 
of them civilians

a 11 million award against school officials 
for barring three young aidsinfected brothers from class is a 
lesson to educators nationwide says the judge who approved the 
settlement of the civil rights suit 
let us hope there will not have to be too many more cases for 
other families and other school boards like the ray case which 
was a landmark case us district judge elizabeth kovachevich 
said thursday after lawyers for both sides outlined the terms in 
court 
she praised both sides for settling the dispute without a trial 
which had been set to begin monday in fort myers 
the agreement between louise and clifford ray and the desoto 
county school district in arcadia gives the couples three sons 
820 a month each for the next 10 years for a total of nearly 
100000 each should one of them die before the end of the period 
the others or their parents would receive the remainder of the 
award 
the parents whose home was burned down by an arsonist during 
the uproar each are to receive about 300 monthly for 30 years 
including a 3 percent annual increase for inflation for a total of 
more than 170000 each the parents also get an immediate 50000 
cash payment 
the settlement to be paid by the school districts insurance 
company contains 387500 for attorney fees and 50000 for court 
costs 
school officials had insisted too much was unknown about 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and they wouldnt risk 
exposing other children to the deadly disease by admitting the 
boys ricky now 11 robert 10 and randy 9 
mrs ray said she hopes school officials have learned as much 
from this situation as we have you shouldnt be afraid of someone 
who has aids because you cant catch it and if you have a disease 
you shouldnt have to be ashamed of it 
the brothers have hemophilia a genetic disease that keeps blood 
from clotting they probably were exposed to the aids virus through 
plasmabased medication to clot their blood 
ricky ray has developed aidsrelated complex which can be a 
precursor to the deadly disease and is being treated with the 
antiaids drug azt his brothers have not exhibited any aids 
symptoms 
patrick e geraghty an attorney for national union fire 
insurance co said he would have preferred to go to trial but 
agreed to settle in an effort to have the matter resolved and put 
behind everyone 
ms kovachevich dismissed the case marking the end to the rays 
complaint that school officials violated their sons rights in 1986 
and 1987 by refusing them admission to elementary school the 
family later fled the town after the fire 
the dispute turned bitter and threw the county into turmoil the 
parents sued angry parents in the rural community formed a 
citizens group to bar aids infected students from school but held 
meetings to combat an image of a town without pity 
in august 1987 the boys went to class under a federal court 
order parents staged a weeklong boycott that cut attendance in 
half 
at the end of that week the rays house was burned by an 
unknown arsonist the family left the central florida town for 
sarasota about 50 miles away where they now live and the boys 
attend school without incident 
thursdays settlement did not require school officials to admit 
negligence said james westberry school board chairman 
the lawsuit which sought unspecified damages accused school 
officials of abusing their power depriving the boys of their 
rights because they were disabled and helping create an atmosphere 
of hatred against the boys 
aids can be transmitted through sexual contact shared 
hypodermic needles and from pregnant women to their fetuses it is 
not spread through casual contact

propelled japanese to their television sets after midnight 
it also sent up cheers from people in many allied nations 
with this america has reclaimed manned space flight nasa has 
shown that it can again launch with safety and regain its lost 
confidence said franz buob a commentator for west germanys zdf 
television network

days in advance and billed it as a major television event despite 
a 98minute delay in the launch most networks kept their promise 
to broadcast it live 
the british broadcasting corp as well as its main rival 
independent television did so people also saw the liftoff live in 
holland italy and switzerland 
soviets however did not see the liftoff the official news

minutes in a newscast several minutes later an announcer reported 
the blastoff against a backdrop of pictures taken of discovery on 
its florida launch pad on wednesday 
tass twosentence report said the shuttle with five astronauts 
aboard blasted off sucessfully the dispatch noted that it was the 
first shuttle launch since the space shuttle challenger exploded 
jan 28 1986 
the news agency also chose thursday to release the first 
pictures of the new soviet space shuttle a winged craft that looks 
just like its us counterpart the timing appeared calculated to 
steal some of the thunder from discoverys launch 
a tass story accompanying the pictures said the soviet shuttle 
at the baikonur cosmodrome in soviet central asia would be 
launched on an unmanned mission to test its design and systems the 
report gave no date but soviet officials have said the liftoff 
will take place sometime later this year

noordwijk netherlands broke into applause as discoverys main 
rockets detached from the shuttle ending the most dangerous phase 
of the launch 
its quite a relief for everybody said dutch former 
astronaut wubbo ockels who flew on a challenger mission in 
november 1985 
staterun spanish television commentator nuria ribo told viewers 
from the cape canaveral launch site the successful launch of the 
shuttle means a lot to americans and the important thing now is

seeing the launch of the space shuttle discovery brought tears 
and relief to some relatives of astronauts killed in the challenger 
disaster but one father avoided watching the liftoff because id 
just see the other one exploding 
it was wonderful fabulous said jane smith widow of 
challenger pilot michael smith im so proud of how everyone did 
their job to make a successful effort 
seeing discovery soar past the tragic challenger milestone was 
very much a relief she said 
but while watching thursdays launch i was unaware of the 
tears that came to me at remembering some of the things that i 
tried very hard not to remember she told abctv in an interview 
at the johnson space center 
challenger exploded 73 seconds after lifting off jan 28 1986 
from launch pad 39b at the kennedy space center in florida from 
that same pad thursday morning discovery rocketed into space to 
begin a fourday 55minute mission 
bruce jarvis father of challenger payload specialist gregory 
jarvis said he listened to the discovery launch on the radio from 
his office in orlando fla declining an invitation to watch at 
cape canaveral because it would bring too many memories back 
i thought about watching it but i couldnt take it jarvis 
said id just see the other one exploding 
his wife ellen the astronauts stepmother did watch from a 
vip viewing site at the space center 
she sat quietly with some of our people as the first space 
shuttle since challenger rose from the launchpad said alan helman 
founder and chairman of the astronauts memorial foundation 
it was clearly an emotional time for her said arnold richman a 
spokesman for the national aeronautics and space administration 
we just hugged and cried he said 
at her home in kona hawaii mitsue onizuka mother of 
challenger mission specialist ellison onizuka said she clapped and 
prayed for the fiveman crew as discoverys powerful rockets fired 
the shuttle into orbit 
it all went so smoothly i prayed for them she said i 
was really happy for them 
the launch helped ease the pain of her sons death she said 
claude onizuka another of her sons traveled to the kennedy 
space center to watch the launch on monday he sent coffee 
macadamia nuts and pineapple from hawaii to officials at mission 
control just as his brother had before his first spaceflight in 
january 1985 
it was ellisons dream to see the program progress onizuka 
said last week before flying to florida if ellison were alive 
hed like to see it fly 
onizuka and smiths son scott watched the launch with the 
families of the discovery astronauts on the roof of a nasa building 
nine miles from the pad nasa officials said they were kept away 
from reporters and nasa had no comment on their reaction 
the other astronauts killed in the disaster were commander dick 
scobee ronald mcnair judith resnik and teacher christa mcauliffe 
mcauliffes son scott a sixthgrader and daughter caroline 
a thirdgrader were in their concord nh school where no

du pont co says it will spend more than 25 
million to begin commercial production in 1990 of a substitute for 
the chemical in auto air conditioners that is considered one of the 
most culpable substances in destroying the earths ozone layer 
the company said thursday it will install a unit at its corpus 
christi texas plant to make hfc134a a shortlived fluorocarbon 
containing no chlorine that the company intends to sell for the 
refrigeration uses of cfc12 one of the chlorofluorocarbon or cfc 
compounds 
du pont is taking a significant risk but a risk our board of 
directors insists we take in deciding on production before the 
completion of toxicity testing said joseph p glas director of du 
ponts freon products division 
since it contains no chlorine the new compound has no effect on 
the ozone layer that keeps those cancercausing rays from reaching 
the surface of the earth when it breaks up in the atmosphere 
it takes the powerful ultraviolet rays of the sun normally 
shielded by ozone high in the stratosphere to break up cfc 
molecules which liberate their chlorine to attack the ozone 
major producing nations agreed last year to cut cfc production 
by 50 percent in 1998 but the environmental protection agency said 
monday its latest analyses show the compounds should be banned 
around the world

the decision of an international arbitration 
panel to back egypt on a disputed beachfront has created a major 
issue in israels election campaign 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the hardline likud bloc 
used the panels ruling to push his view that israel should not 
agree to an international conference on middle east peace 
it was proven yet again that an international arbitrage always 
harms israels interests and taba is not an exception shamir 
said on israel television thursday 
this is a lesson for the future said shamir he said the 
rival leftleaning labor party has wrongly pushed for arbitration 
rather than talks with egypt to resolve the dispute 
however energy minister moshe shachal of the labor party said 
at a news conference in tel aviv that shamir preferred narrow 
party interests to national and to the real solution of the 
taba problem 
we could have reached a compromise but he preferred to ignore 
the problems and to bring the situation to the point of no 
return shachal said thursday 
shamir fears an international forum would force israel to make 
territorial concessions on the west bank and gaza strip 
territories the jewish state has occupied since the 1967 middle 
east war labor favors such an international conference 
the future of the west bank and gaza with their 15million 
palestinian population is the focal point of the parliament 
elections scheduled for nov 1 the territories have been torn by 
an antiisraeli uprising since december 
the international arbitration panel in its decision published 
thursday in geneva awarded five key disputed border points to 
egypt 
the fivemember arbitration team is made up of members from 
sweden france switzerland egypt and israel they ruled 41 with 
the israeli member opposed an arbitration agreement signed on 
sept 11 1986 commits egypt and israel to carry out the ruling 
however the decision does not actually give taba a 250acre 
beachfront resort to egypt though egypt won key boundary markers 
israeli officials said more bilateral talks are needed to draw the 
actual border line

for all the prelaunch claims of 
confidence discoverys end to a painful 32month us hiatus from 
space filled the nations space centers with jubilation and nearly 
as much relief 
the directors the rocket scientists the engineers the 
technicians the security guards and the janitors joined in a 
catharsis of roaring cheers and unstoppable tears thursday 
i was quite surprised at my emotions admitted j wayne 
littles a veteran of years of launches and now director of science 
and engineering at marshall space flight center in huntsville ala 
i hollered it was a tremendous feeling of accomplishment to get 
the launch behind us 
its a great relief to see a perfect launch again added 
tommy harris a marshall engineer weve been working so long on 
this thing 
as he and other nasa officials had said earlier kennedy space 
center director forrest mccartney repeated that every launch has 
risk and each is special 
but some are more special 
unique super great all those good words mccartney said 
smiling broadly and grabbing hands to shake 
its an indescribable boost to morale he said the sole 
job of these people is to do what they did today its been a very 
long time for them this was their living their masterpiece 
today 
hundreds of workers not involved in the launch left their posts 
thursday morning to watch discovery blast brilliantly away from 
launchpad 39b challenger had left from the same spot jan 26 
1986 exploding 73 seconds later killing seven astronauts and 
triggering upheaval and uncertainty in the us space program 
some said they couldnt hold back their tears and shook with 
emotion at the launch they hoped would revitalize the us space 
program 
everybodys going out to buy a house now said a security 
guard as the workers shook hands and began laughing on their way 
back to work 
some of the strongest emotions were at the morton thiokol plant 
near brigham city utah the company became indelibly imprinted 
with the challenger tragedy after investigation blamed failure of a 
sealing ring on one of the twin solid rocket boosters it designed 
for the shuttles 
reputations are very fragile once they are damaged it takes 
a long time to fix them said dick davis a thiokol vice 
president and program manager the way to put them back together 
is to have successful launches 
after listening to davis by telephone hookup from kennedy space 
center mel rogers who works on the boosters nozzles said it 
felt good to hit something positive for once the things are hard 
enough to make let alone be criticized 
had something gone wrong he said id have had to move 
when you work on a program as long as we have whenever a 
space shuttle flies it does bring a tear to your eye said mike 
ayers director of finance for the companys space operations 
any space shuttle flight is an emotional experience especially 
for the employees who worked so hard to put the shuttle back into 
flight 
ribbons and clothing in green for go and buttons showing the 
discovery crew with the unofficial theme back to the future 
were worn by thousands of space workers their ranks had little to 
do with their immediate reactions 
i got a cold chill it was great said lois veder a 
saleswoman at nasas gift shop at edwards air force base calif 
where discovery is scheduled to return to earth on monday 
they just loved seeing that shuttle fly again said marion 
lanasa spokesman for martinmarietta manned space systems in new 
orleans from the janitors to the engineers all 3500 employees 
feel a very personal tie to the shuttle we have all suffered with 
nasa for the last 32 months and we celebrate with them today 
this is a very very special mission to us all said john 
kaltenbach an 18year nasa employee who watched at johnson space 
center in houston as a senior advance system specialist for 
lockheed corp there was probably more apprehension and 
excitement in this one this one had to fly

housewives local fishermen and 
conservation officers worked frantically early today to save 39 
whales stranded on a remote beach on the west coast of australia 
they said 21 of the beached mammals had already died near 
augusta 150 miles south of perth in western australia 
the volunteers and others numbering about 100 people in all 
stroked the creatures and kept them moistened through the night to 
keep them alive 
the school of 60 false killer whales are believed to have 
beached themselves wednesday night at the scott river national 
park just east of augusta 
the department of conservation and land management rushed 
experts to the beach after the whales were found thursday afternoon 
scattered along a five mile stretch of beach volunteers soon 
joined the rescue effort 
augusta postmaster gary nash said it will be a tough battle 
because access to the beach was hampered by thick forests 
many of the whales were battered by heavy surf this morning 
while others were several yards up the beach and partly covered in 
sand 
dave mell chief wildlife officer for the department said they 
wanted to move the 39 stricken whales six miles west to a sheltered 
inlet and then lead them out to sea 
augusta was the site of a dramatic rescue operation in july 1986 
when 140 false killer whales stranded themselves at another beach 
near the town 
that rescue operation involving hundreds of volunteers saved 
all but a handful of the whales and captured worldwide headlines 
mell said it was hoped front end loaders and fourwheeldrive 
vehicles would be able to transport the whales along the beach but 
he said sections of the sand were soft and tricky for vehicles 
some of the whales look remarkably good and have weathered the 
trauma of coming ashore quite well he said some perished soon 
after stranding 
one thing in our favour is the weather its cold and they need 
to be keep wet and cool 
volunteers braved cold conditions to stay with the stranded 
whales through the night with groups adopting individual 
animals 
mell cautioned that the whales would drown if they were unable 
to stay upright in the heavy surf or if they overheated because 
they were out of the water 
the cause of the mass beaching is not known

the worlds top officials on financial aid to poor 
countries have left an annual congress for home with memories of 
police sirens and demonstrators chants 
the officials from 151 countries say they are working at home 
for exactly what the demonstrators in west berlin demanded an end 
to hunger poverty illiteracy and damage to the environment in the 
third world 
at the joint annual meeting of the world bank and the 
international monetary fund which ended thursday the staffs 
final urgent notice said 
the german authorities have advised that a demonstration is 
scheduled to take place in the downtown area of west berlin in 
the late afternoon today participants who plan to leave 
are advised to check out of their hotels as soon as feasible to 
avoid delays and missed flights 
every night since sunday demonstrators poured into major 
streets in downtown west berlin sometimes fighting riot police 
but most of the protesters just chanted slogans against the two 
organizations 
many protesters were injured but no serious casualties have 
been reported about 500 demonstrators were briefly detained and at 
least one vehicle was set afire 
the demonstrators made their point with slogans like murder 
meeting and signs that told the participants to go home and 
count their money 
at least one finance minister j b sumarlin of indonesia 
agreed in a speech that some programs of the monetary fund did more 
harm than good 
the world bank is the chief source of aid loans on easy 
financial terms for third world countries the fund also lends 
money to them and organizes loan packages 
borrowers and critics complain the austerity programs often 
imposed with the loans hurt poor people 
michel camdessus managing director of the fund says 
governments inflict even more suffering on their people if they 
refuse to make the policy changes it asks in return for loans 
many participants in the meeting were impressed by the 
atmosphere in berlin they have never had so much public attention 
meetings usually take place in washington a city not given to 
street confrontations 
barber b conable president of the bank told reporters that he 
had no time to make contact with the opposition 
i realize that they question the effectiveness of world bank 
programs he said i think we must carry a burden of 
explanation as to our use of public moneys 
the opposition was organized by leftwing groups 
but there was no sign of participation by the german democratic 
republic on the other side of the berlin wall its communist 
leaders are reported to want to join the bank and fund and secure 
loans in hard currency

discovery flawlessly lift off the launch pad 
i had my fingers crossed the whole time said christy holt 
a fifthgrader at julian harris elementary school in decatur ala 
where about 80 children watched the launch thursday 
the school is on mcauliffe drive named for christa mcauliffe 
the concord nh teacher who was killed in the challenger 
explosion on jan 28 1986 
the successful launch of discovery came as a relief to teachers 
who had to explain to their students what had happened 32 months 
ago 
students of the next american teacher in line to fly aboard a 
shuttle watched the liftoff at their school in mccall idaho their 
teacher barbara morgan was in florida for the launch as she was 
for challenger 
we never had any doubt about putting the kids in there 
again said mccalldonnelly elementary school principal john 
wall we just needed to do it im relieved everything went well 
i was more worried than i wanted to admit 
although the national aeronautics and space administration has 
not set any date for civilians to return to space morgan was 
enthusiastic about the possibility of flying aboard a shuttle 
when theyre ready to send me ill be there she said 
at an ohio school with a library named after challenger 
astronaut and alumna judith resnik students who felt a special 
loss from the challenger disaster were absorbed by discoverys 
launch 
suddenly everyone became very observant said dennis woods 
principal of akron firestone high school 
that last 10 seconds the kids were counting it off when it 
left the pad there was a round of applause then there was a 
period of ominous silence as the kids remembered the challenger 
when the rocket booster was released that brought on another round 
of applause 
students at challenger junior high school in san diego watched 
the liftoff on television monitors in 30 classrooms the students 
earlier sent goodwill messages to the discovery crew 
seventh graders in rosemary eskridges science class at 
eisenhower middle school in oklahoma city were sophisticated enough 
to hold their cheers until discovery separated from its booster 
rocket it was at the separation stage that challenger blew up 
donna hanebut a third grade teacher at uintah elementary school 
in south ogden utah said there was lots of excitement and 
apprehension among students she had led on an expedition last 
summer to the us space camp training center at marshall space 
flight center in huntsville ala 
at the camp more than 100 students from grades two through high 
school assembled at a pep rally for the launch

one of the many satellites crowding 
the orbital skies above the earth briefly threatened to affect the 
launch of space shuttle discovery 
when liftoff of the spacecraft was delayed thursday morning 
engineers in launch control at cape canaveral announced that though 
the shuttle could be launched as late 230 pm edt there were two 
brief periods that were restricted because of satellites passing 
near discoverys flight path 
officials at the johnson space center said they received a 
collision avoidance warning from the air force missile command 
which keeps track of the hundreds of satellites in orbit 
flight director gary coen said the warning had no effect on the 
discovery mission because the shuttle was launched at 1137 am 
edt almost a half hour before the first of the two resticted times 
the satellites that triggered the warnings were not identifed by 
the air force

physicist james a van allen said he was 
rooting for a safe launch for the shuttle discovery but its 
successful liftoff does not change his outlook that manned space 
travel is slighting science 
van allen a pioneer in unmanned exploration from the earliest 
days of ventures into space grumbled even before the challenger 
disaster 32 months ago that the united states was putting too much 
emphasis on manned flights and letting scientific experiments that 
could fly on unmanned rockets languish 
van allen discoverer of the radiation belts that surround the 
earth and are named for him and a team of university of iowa 
scientists designed instruments for the jan 31 1958 launch of 
explorer 1 the first us satellite 
van allen also directed the pioneer 10 program a flyby probe to 
jupiter that continues to send back information 
after 16 years pioneer 10 is 4 billion miles away from earth 
and traveling at 28400 miles an hour it is the most remote 
manmade object in the universe

more than 1000 journalists at a 
remote press site cheered discoverys majestic liftoff but 
expressed disappointment that new safety rules prevented them from 
a closer view 
prompted by air force concerns that the complex 39 press site 
could be bombarded by falling debris if the solid rocket boosters 
malfunctioned only 1800 reporters were allowed to work from the 
main press site just over four miles from the launchpad daily 
newspapers were allowed to have just two people at the main press 
site 
the alternate press site was more than six miles from the 
launchpad 
despite the spectacular liftoff reporters at the remote site 
were envious of their colleagues who were closer to the launch pad 
and expressed fears that additional restrictions may follow 
most of the journalists arrived at the mosquitoinfested site 
before dawn after driving in bumpertobumper traffic for up to two 
hours from titusville and cocoa beach 
reporters complained the lack of telephones electricity and 
work space limited their usefulness at the remote site

south koreas foreign minister says his 
government would be willing to discuss withdrawal of us military 
forces from its territory only after serious negotiations with 
north korea on reducing tension 
rejecting familiar north korean demands choi kwangsoo said 
thursday night that the withdrawal of american forces from korea 
cannot be a precondition cannot be an obstruction to serious 
serious negotiations between the two parts of korea 
but we are prepared to consider the reduction in 
consultation with your us government if we have successful 
negotiations with north korea for reduction of tension the 
minister said in reply to questions from an audience of 300 at the 
washington world affairs council 
choi said south korea had expressed its sentiments to north 
korea the soviet union and china and he hopes the two communist 
powers will influence their ally toward dialogue 
the united states has an estimated 40000 ground and air forces 
based in south korea 
describing us forces in korea as a deterrent threatening no 
one choi said we have made it known to north korea to the 
soviet union to the chinese that withdrawal of american forces 
is one of the main topics that has to be tackled in negotiations 
for peace and stability but only after ending tension and 
mistrust between the two koreas and reaching an accord 
the vast majority of south korean people want them to stay 
as a vital deterrent against resumption of hostilities by the 
north choi said of us troops that have been in south korea since 
the 195053 korean war choi described recent antiamerican 
flareups in his country as the work of a few radical students 
public airing of antiamerican sentiments is a testament to 
the new pluralism and political liberalization in full swing in 
south korea he said in a prepared speech preceding the 
30minute questionandanswer session 
choi confirmed reports of seouls expanding contacts with 
beijing and moscow ussoviet relations have reached a new 
plateau and this is good news for korea he said describing 
a trend of substantial progress in unofficial relations with 
china and increasing contacts with moscow 
the soviet union despite providing vast amounts of military aid 
including sophisticated weapons to north korea and china are 
demonstrating today that they have a stake in peace and regional 
stability choi said in this spirit we are trying our best to 
improve our relations with these two powers with one of the 
goals being to influence north korea he added 
choi said south korean president roh taewoos july 7 proposals 
on reducing tension and ending confrontation between north and 
south korea and their respective allies already have helped produce 
a hungariansouth korean agreement to pursue full diplomatic 
relations but south korean is waiting for a positive response from 
north korea he said 
the minister flew to washington for his appearance and was 
returning to new york to prepare for the planned appearances of 
both south and north korea before the un general assembly

protesters hurled firebombs into us 
army headquarters in seoul today and fled before riot police could 
intervene authorities said 
police and us military authorities said the firebombs did not 
cause any damage when they were hurled over a wall into a motor 
pool at the headquarters of the 8th us army in a central district 
south korea has been hit by a burst of antiamerican sentiment 
provoked by several incidents during the olympics radical students 
have staged antiamerican protests to try and play up the issue 
police said nine people were involved in the attack and police 
officers chased the attackers but failed to catch any of them 
yonhap the south korean news agency said more than 20 youths 
were involved in the incident and they appeared to be students the 
agency said four firebombs were hurled and the attackers left 15 
more behind 
a us military spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said it was the second firebomb attack on us military facilities 
following a similar incident earlier this year a window was broken 
in the first incident 
shortly before the attack police broke up a group of about 30 
students from dongguk university who scattered antiamerican 
leaflets near the us base police arrested seven of the students 
who scattered leaflets saying punish the yankees 
about 42000 us troops are based in south korea under a mutual 
defense treaty 
about 50 students with firebombs and clubs later held a rally at 
dongguk to denounce the united states they brandished the weapons 
at riot police outside the school but there was no clash and 
students dispersed peacefully 
a group of students presented a letter today to the us embassy 
protesting the behavior of american athletes and journalists during 
the olympics 
the incidents are clear evidence that americans are slighting 
the korean people the letter said 
us athletes and media have been criticized by some south 
koreans for their conduct during the olympics which end sunday 
south korean newspapers have attacked nbc for its coverage of an 
attack by south korean boxing officials on a referee who awarded a 
match against a local favorite the lax conduct of the us team at 
the games opening ceremony and the arrest of three american 
athletes have spurred further criticism

new york cartoonist charles addams whose macabre characters 
and morbid humor haunted the pages of the new yorker magazine for 
half a century and spawned the addams family tv show of the 
1960s has died he was 76 
addams died thursday in the emergency room at st clares 
hospital and health center said mary alice gregg a hospital 
administrator 
he suffered a heart attack in his car in front of his manhattan 
apartment building said his wife marilyn 
hes always been a car buff so it was a nice way to go 
said mrs addams who married her husband in a pet cemetery in 1980 
he thought it would be nice and cheerful she said of the 
wedding 
his first cartoon was published in the new yorker in 1935 but 
his first major one was published there on jan 13 1940 it showed 
a woman skier whose tracks passed neatly but inexplicably on both 
sides of a large tree 
i cant imagine the magazine without him said robert 
gottlieb the magazines editor 
addams born in westfield nj doodled skulls and bones for 
his high school newspaper before studying further at colgate 
university the university of pennsylvania and the grand central 
school of art in new york 
his ghoulish characters whose rundown victorian mansion was 
crowded with infernal devices and lurking creatures was the 
inspiration for the addams family television show of the 1960s 
the addamses from morticia the blackgowned matriarch to lurch 
the giant butler and thing a hand that popped out of a box were 
directly inspired by addams cartoons 
addams has produced 10 cartoon collections that have together 
sold more than 460000 copies 
the new york times art critic john russell called addams an 
american landmark one of the few by which one and all have learned 
to steer 
but russell said ghouls and ghosts are not the whole of 
addams the jokes are so good that we do not notice the sturdiness 
of the line the rocksolid composition the eye for scale and 
placement the calculated ordinariness that lures us into the 
trap 
some of addams cartoons take a moment to figure out 
in one a bus driver looks disquieted because the next stop 
buzzer has just been pulled after a moment the reader usually 
notices that the bus is approaching a rainswept graveyard and no 
one but the driver is on board 
in another four scouts cross a brook on a fallen tree carrying 
a banner that says beaver patrol each of the scouts has buck 
teeth and the reader is left to wonder whether the tree fell 
because of beavers or the patrol 
although he profited immensely from his work addams said he did 
not reap large direct benefits from the television show 
they gave me money each week but after the first runs ended i 
didnt get anything no residuals this was a mistake made by the 
big old fat law firm i let represent me addams once said 
john ohara a friend of addams said his drawings belied his 
personality 
i dont think hed hurt a fly he said i never have seen 
him lose his temper although that is not to say he doesnt get 
mad he happens to be what is called easygoing and has a decent 
contempt for the opinions of mankind 
new yorker spokeswoman rhonda pinzer said the magazine still has 
some covers and cartoons that addams had submitted and probably 
will run in the future 
mrs addams said the funeral would be private

a freespending insurance executive 
making his first bid for office holds a commanding lead over 
threeterm republican gov arch moore who has made a career of 
overcoming political hardship 
gaston caperton spent a record 21 million in the primary in a 
state where fellow democrat and former gov jay rockefeller made 
deeppocket politics common he wont say how much hell spend on 
the general election 
moore has been unusually successful in a state where registered 
democrats have a 2to1 advantage but a poll in late august and 
early september gave caperton a 6031 percent lead and many 
democrats whose support moore needs expressed reluctance to cross 
party lines again 
in a speech earlier this month moore said the poll conducted 
for the associated press charleston daily mail and wsaztv gives 
him one heck of a heartburn but he called it an aberration 
a feisty campaigner who defies categorization as a conservative 
or liberal moore often fares poorly in early polls he trailed 
john raese early in the race for the gop nomination this year and 
still won by a 5347 percent margin 
caperton whose mcdonough caperton insurance group is the 
nations 18thlargest insurance company suggested moore is in 
trouble in this financially ailing state where coal and other 
backbone industries are in a slump 
the story in the primary was not that arch moore came from 
behind and won the story is that an incumbent governor only got 53 
percent of the vote caperton said 
moore 65 has portrayed the 48yearold caperton as a rich kid 
whos trying to buy the election referring to him once as cash 
and spendaton 
but moore also is spending freely starting his tv advertising 
in early summer far before the traditional labor day start of the 
political season he spent 716000 on the primary 
moore served six straight terms in congress then won election 
as governor in 1968 in 1972 using a justapproved constitutional 
amendment he became the first west virginia governor to succeed 
himself defeating rockefeller 
before leaving office under a constitutional provision barring a 
third straight term moore was indicted on charges of trying to get 
a charter for a new bank in exchange for 25000 he was acquitted 
he lost a bid for the us senate in 1978 and lost the 
governors race to rockefeller in 1980 before making a comeback in 
1984 against clyde see 
revenue during moores third term has slumped and the governor 
was forced to borrow 80 million this year to keep the state 
running west virginia didnt send out its 1987 income tax refunds 
until last week 
moore said the democraticcontrolled legislature has rebuffed 
many of his efforts to improve the economy he maintains that the 
state is in recovery and his schedule is filled with plant 
openings and announcements of grants 
i dont think the people are going to be fooled by ribbon 
cuttings capterton said he cannot fool the people of west 
virginia that hes done a good job when the reality is different 
from what it is in his ads

the us southern command vigorously 
protested the seizure of a shipment of us military equipment that 
panamanian officials said may have been destined for 
antigovernment groups 
the protest on thursday came after attorney general carlos 
villalaz announced that customs agents had seized the 
usregistered ship ambassador and its cargo panama said it 
discovered a 120mm cannon and other war materiel inside sealed 
containers on board the vessel 
the cargo identified on the ships manifest as general 
merchandise was destined for the southern command villalaz told 
a news conference in this atlantic port city located 50 miles north 
of panama city 
he said the attempted delivery of war materiel in the civilian 
port violated the 1977 panama canal treaties 
the southern command is based in the former canal zone and 
oversees all us military operations in latin america 
villalaz said that for security reasons the government 
prohibits ships from carrying arms into las minas port 10 miles 
east of colon a refinery based in las minas processes crude oil 
imports for panamanian consumption 
the ambassador which arrived wednesday from fort lauderdale 
fla and its cargo were seized on thursday 
a southern command spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the shipment was legal under the treaties and that 
the southern command had vigorously protested the incident 
he said a us military officer was denied access to the cargo 
shipment 
they illegally seized equipment belonging to the united states 
army the spokesman said adding it was the first time panama had 
confiscated us military equipment 
villalaz said customs agents discovered the cannon and two 
fiveton troop transport vehicles on board the ambassador customs 
officials suspected that boxes yet to be opened contained munitions 
and arms he said 
villalaz suggested the arms could have been used by opponents of 
the government which is controlled by defense forces commander 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
authorities arrested 26 opposition activists last week and 
accused them of involvement in a ussponsored subversion plan 
the us embassy denied the charge 
the reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions against 
panama in a bid to force the ouster of noriega who is under us 
indictment on drug trafficking charges 
the southern command spokesman refused to identify the equipment 
on board the ambassador but said the 120mm cannon was totally 
useless and sent to panama to be used in a testing center where 
the effects of tropical conditions on munitions storage are 
tested 
under the canal treaties the united states is to turn over 
control of the waterway to panama on dec 31 1999

the massachusetts governor 
redford said he supported dukakis because we cant sit back

the republican vice presidential candidates blond good looks 
have been compared with redfords since 1980 when quayle first ran 
for the senate and the comparison resurface after quayle was 
picked as george bushs running mate 
in fact quayle associates have said that the indiana senators 
political aspirations had been inspired in part by the

fortythree of 112 roman catholic churches here 
have been recommended for closure in what could be the countrys 
biggest wave of church closings but some pastors and parishioners 
have vowed to resist the plan 
its more than shocking said the rev anthony helinski 
whose st ignatius of antioch would merge with another 
congregation its an insult its unfair its unchristian 
the proposal presented wednesday after a fouryear study would 
affect mostly innercity parishes that have had a sharp decline in 
their congregations and have aging 19thcentury churches that are 
costly to maintain and operate 
we want an alive vibrant parish that really makes a 
difference in this area the community cardinal edmund szoka 
archbishop of the diocese said after a closedcircuit broadcast to 
parishes outlining the recommendations 
money certainly has to be a consideration we live in a world 
where we need money 
by thursday at least 20 parishes targeted to close said they 
would appeal the recommendations 
one pastor who planned to appeal was the rev casimir butkus 
whose st peters parish is predominantly lithuanian 
under the czars churches are closed under the communists 
under the germans and now the same thing from their own 
archbishop he said 
its not over til its over said joe rivers 69 a 
parishioner at st bernards were not giving up were going to 
fight it 
most of the targeted parishes are in areas of the city that have 
been depopulated by the migrigation to the suburbs in recent 
decades 
joseph madison president of the michigan leadership conference 
said the closings are symptomatic of a decaying city 
i dont think you could find a single historical parallel to 
this said msgr john tracy ellis a historian at catholic 
university in washington dc 
theyre closing up parishes and there will be more of them 
closings in the future if the present conditions continue but 
not anywhere near this number 
detroit isnt alone in facing urban pressures the chicago 
archdiocese announced plans last year to close two landmark 
churches and indicated that as many as 25 other innercity churches 
may be abandoned 
still the recommendations here shocked many church members 
when you take away our church youre playing with our 
souls said georgia hernandez who attends st charles borromeo 
the recommendations by the archdioceses citychurch task force 
would reduce the citys 112 parish churches to 63 parishes four 
missions and two shrines the archdiocese said thursday in 
addition some parishes would be merged the churches targeted for 
closure have about 10000 members 
churches have until oct 13 to appeal to bishop patrick cooney 
who supervised the study 
appeals hearings are to end by dec 15 and szoka is to announce 
his final ruling by early january all closings and mergers must be 
completed by june 30 
the detroit archdiocese comprises 331 parishes in six counties 
with about 15 million members

a woman separated from her husband has 
sued the state saying she shouldnt be forced to have a judge 
determine the father of her 2yearold daughter before she can 
choose the girls last name 
at stake in the lawsuit filed thursday in us district court is 
whether betty virella who hasnt seen her husband in more than 
seven years can name her daughter jacqueline after the girls 
father james aponte 
virella 30 of providence said the state health department has 
refused to issue a birth certificate unless she agrees to use the 
surname of her estranged husband victor andino 
i dont have a birth certificate for my daughter and shes 2 
years old now virella said its like jacqueline is not in 
this world 
mary ellen mccabe the health departments chief legal counsel 
said the department seeks to protect the rights of the legal 
father who may not be the same as the biological father 
under rhode island law a womans husband is the legal father 
and her child must have the husbands surname unless there is a 
court ruling that another man was the father said mccabe who 
would not comment directly on virellas case 
jean rosiello an american civil liberties union attorney who 
represents virella said virella had not sought a court order on 
paternity and should not be forced to do so 
our point is that whether she can afford the expense of going 
to family court she has the right to choose the name of her 
child rosiello said 
virella who uses her maiden name said she had to produce 
records showing she had been pregnant had given birth and that the 
child was still alive to enroll jacqueline in aid to families with 
dependent children 
an expert on vital statistics said policies dictating a childs 
surname are becoming rare 
there are not that many states that do it anymore said mary 
anne freedman director of health statistics in vermont and past 
president of the association for vital records and health 
statistics 
over the course of the past 20 years parents have been naming 
their childen with surnames that bear no relation to either the 
fathers or mothers names she said 
in a 1986 letter to women amp infants hospital where jacqueline 
was born the health department said that if a mother is married at 
conception or birth the parents may give the child any name they 
wish as long as both parents sign the worksheet 
virella said she was worried her estranged husband could someday 
claim custody if the child bore his name 
the choice of a surname is a legal matter which has a lot of 
bearing on the rights of the child said george gay chief of 
registration methods at the national center for health statistics 
in most states a court order on paternity would be the easiest 
way to clear up the situation he said 
virella said she left andino 12 years ago when she moved to new 
york city from puerto rico she said she last saw andino who still 
lives in puerto rico more than seven years ago 
she said her other daughter jennifer 4 was born in new york 
city and was allowed to have apontes surname

here comes the bride 
and there she goes around the far curve and past the checkered 
flag driven by camille connolly bridal shop owner by day stock 
car racer by night 
the bride a 1983 mercury capri sports a 2foot bride doll 
peeking out her rear window its to remind spectators at santa fe 
speedway in suburban hinsdale just who is behind the wheel 
connolly says her shop customers often are shocked when they 
make the connection between the 5foot2 110pound woman who 
designed their wedding gown and the helmeted figure rocketing into 
a curve like some kind of speed demon 
they say we could never picture anybody like you doing 
something like that she said i guess i dont have dirt under 
my fingernails or something 
connolly 52 began racing in 1977 in a 14yearold lincoln 
continental that her husband had bought for 35 and painted pink 
this was going to be a onenight thing lets all have a big 
laugh connolly said 
its one of those things that just has snowballed maybe 
we just got lucky we both hit on something we really enjoy said 
her husband bob a usedcar dealer who maintains his wifes racing 
car it beats playing bingo 
connolly started racing in powder puff races reserved for 
women but soon graduated to the more competitive lightning rod 
class where she finished third last season results from this 
seasons races still are being tallied but she has won several 
times 
the lightning rod class is one in which few women venture and 
fewer remain 
probably because they dont realize how competitive it is or 
their cars didnt hold up or they were afraid she said 
but for her fear is no problem 
with anything like this theres a risk she said but we 
do a lot to protect me in the car 
danger is half the fun added her husband who is confident his 
maintenance of the car will keep her safe 
its like people who jump out of airplanes he said 
everybody knows that the risk is there its part of the 
magnetism of the sport 
that hasnt stopped the couples five children ages 23 to 29 
from worrying 
when i go to the track theyll say mom be careful 
camille connolly said i used to say that to them when they 
started driving 
she has the name of her suburban berwyn bridal shop which she 
took over from her mother painted across the back of her car but 
what grabs attention is the doll which connolly adorns with a new 
bridal dress three or four times a year only to see it muddied 
the first time out 
some races you cant see her face its all covered in mud 
she said 
but other drivers dont seem to care whether connolly owns a 
bridal shop or a muffler shop 
you ride around the track and you look in your mirror and 
theres camille said george hayes who has raced against 
connolly for seven years you cant shake her shes always 
competitive

after nearly seven years of court proceedings it 
took a jury just over two hours to reject the claim by former gov 
edward j king that he was libeled by a 1981 political column in 
the boston globe 
but the former chief executive claimed he was vindicated anyway 
because the verdict issued thursday found one sentence in the 
column was false 
we did the very best we could king said after the verdict 
in suffolk superior court he said he did not consider the lawsuit 
a waste of time because now we know that something the globe 
never retracted was a false statement 
king who said earlier that he might run for governor again if 
he prevailed said he and his lawyer would decide whether to appeal 
the ruling within 30 days he had no comment on his political 
plans ifany 
after six days of testimony the jury returned a special verdict 
slip that said former globe columnist david farrell was wrong when 
he wrote in a nov 8 1981 column that king called a judge to 
demand harsher sentences in a gangrape case 
but when asked if they believed the statement discredited king 
among any considerable and respectable class of the community 
the jury answered no and decided the case in favor of the globe 
king needed to prevail on each question on the verdict slip to win 
john driscoll the newspapers editor said the verdict upheld 
freedom of speech 
after seven years of litigation the jury has reaffirmed the 
right of all people including columnists and cartoonists to 
speak and write freely about the actions of government driscoll 
said 
farrell 62 who resigned from the globe in 1985 and now works 
in public relations said he was relieved 
im very pleased and i feel vindicated i always felt i did a 
good job writing the column farrell said asked if he still 
believes king called the judge farrell said yes 
king who joined the republican party after losing the september 
1982 democratic primary to gov michael s dukakis filed suit in 
january 1982 against the globe and several editorial employees 
seeking 36 million 
king testified that the column amounted to a charge of 
obstruction of justice and struck him like an ice pick in the 
ribs causing him to lose sleep on more than 1000 nights 
on crossexamination king acknowledged that he never publicly 
denied making the call globe attorney joseph kociubes argued that 
king who was thinking of suing the globe before the column did 
not show evidence of financial social or political harm 
farrell testified that he was told about kings purported call 
to judge herbert abrams by state treasurer robert q crane an old 
friend of farrell whom he considered a reliable source about 
massachusetts politics 
crane testified that he was the source but could not recall who 
told him about the call both king and abrams swore that no call 
took place 
under libel law a public figure such as king has the burden of 
showing not only that a publication was false but that it defamed 
him further the governor must have shown that the column was 
published with actual malice that is with knowing falsity or 
with reckless disregard for the truth

a taiwan business organization will send 
an 80member delegation to the soviet union next week in the first 
such visit to the communist nation a trade leader said today 
lin tzyching chairman of the taiwan importers and exporters 
association said the private group planned to buy raw materials 
from moscow and promote sales of taiwan products to the soviets 
the visit has been sanctioned by the government lin said 
we will see how good business opportunities are in the soviet 
union and make suggestions to the government he said 
the group will leave monday for bangkok where it will fly to 
moscow for a 14day visit he added 
taiwan still bans direct trade with soviet union and albania 
however authorities have said this islands economic policies 
should be independent from the governments anticommunist stance 
earlier this year the taiwan government announced measures to 
encourage trade with seven east european countries easing 
restrictions and permitting direct imports of consumer goods from 
east germany poland hungary romania bulgaria czechoslovakia 
and yugoslavia 
industrialists have long urged the government to allow direct 
trade with the soviet union noting indirect trade with the soviets 
has accounted for more than half the total trade with east europe 
last year taiwans exports to east europe totaled 75 million 
nearly double that of 1986 imports from east european countries 
totaled 190 million a 119 percent increase from 1986

the performance of morton thiokols 
booster rockets as they helped lift the space shuttle discovery 
into orbit drew cheers of relief from proud employees who saw it as 
a first step toward rebuilding the companys reputation 
reputations are very fragile once they are damaged it takes 
a long time to fix them said dick davis vice president the 
way to put them back together is to have successful launches 
employees at the rocketmakers wasatch operations 25 miles west 
of here erupted in cheers as they watched the launch on television 
monitors the jubilant scene thursday was in stark contrast to 32 
months before when a faulty seal on a morton thiokol booster caused 
challengers destruction and grounded the nations manned space 
program 
morton thiokol was held partly to blame for the accident at one 
point in the launch deliberations a company official was ordered 
to take off his engineering hat and put on his management hat 
senior managers then overrode the objections of some engineers to a 
coldweather launch 
thursday hundreds of morton thiokol officials and engineers 
were at cape canaveral for the launch reporters were barred from 
company premises in utah in part so employees could watch the 
launch in private said spokesman rocky raab 
davis spoke by telephone to the companys utah employees minutes 
after launch 
i really want to thank the 3000 people in utah who put 
themselves into the program and worked so hard working in a 
fishbowl environment on the booster davis said there was a 
very definite sense of relief and pride that our motors had 
worked 
in the wake of the challenger disaster morton thiokol 
redesigned its booster the largest solidfuel rocket ever built 
at a cost of 500 million most changes were aimed at improving the 
critical joint seals 
when you work on a program as long as we have whenever a 
space shuttle flies it does bring a tear to your eye said mike 
ayers director of finance for space operations any space 
shuttle launch is an emotional experience especially for the 
employees that worked so hard to put the shuttle back into flight 
mel rogers who works on the boosters nozzles said that if 
something had gone wrong thursday id have had to move 
it felt good to hit something positive for once rogers 
said the things are hard enough to make let alone be 
criticized 
thursdays launch was hailed by brigham city mayor peter 
knudson most of morton thiokols 8000 utah employees live in and 
around his city 
the mayor a dentist did not watch the launch because he was 
with a patient when informed by a reporter it was a success he 
struggled to speak 
thats fantastic im near tears its a very emotional moment 
for me ive personally lived with this for so long i just cant 
tell you what this means to me knudson said 
wes boman brigham city chamber of commerce director said that 
while the shuttle program was on hold there was a sense of anxiety 
in the town residents put off large purchases and the housing 
market went at a slower pace he said 
sen jake garn rutah who experienced a sevenday space flight 
aboard discovery in april 1985 attended thursdays launch 
it was hot down there in florida but i had goose bumps and 
was crying garn said after returning to washington i really 
would like to go up again

here are high points of the reforms communist 
party chief mikhail s gorbachev is seeking in the soviet political 
system and party apparatus which party leaders and lawmakers will 
reportedly consider this week 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a stronger presidency apparently desiring a government post 
tailored to his own talents gorbachev has called for giving the 
soviet president responsibility over defense and foreign policy and 
power to name the prime minister president andrei a gromyko now 
head of state holds an essentially ceremonial job 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a more active legislature gorbachev wants the 1500member 
supreme soviet the countrys nominal parliament merged with a new 
750seat body representing artists labor union members and other 
social groups that assembly would then elect a fulltime 
parliament of 400 or so members who would have real powers to pass 
a state budget and other laws 
</TEXT>

multicandidate elections the soviet leader wants voters 
nationwide for the first time to have a choice of candidates in 
elections to the expanded supreme soviet by next march it is 
likely however that the communist party would keep its power of 
veto over individual candidacies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a slimmeddown party gorbachev wants the partys 20million 
membership roll reduced and its apparatus trimmed those goals are 
in line with his often stated desire to more clearly delineate 
party and government responsibilities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
indirect control on party bosses gorbachev wants local party 
chiefs to run for their local legislatures and be elected to be 
their chairmen if they fail to win either election because of a 
lack of popular support they could lose their party post as well 
the partys central committee adopted broad goals for political 
reform on july 29 after hearing gorbachev outline his agenda those 
decisions however were never made public and could differ from 
the reforms sought by gorbachev 
the soviet leader has said changes are needed in the countrys 
political system to prevent any repeat of the bloody repression 
carried out under josef v stalin or the corruption and stagnation 
now seen as endemic under leonid i brezhnev

pope john paul ii today issued a major 
document on women that condemns discrimination reaffirms a ban on 
female priests and says womens personalities are formed 
essentially by maternal characteristics 
the 120page document touches only briefly on the institutional 
role of women in the roman catholic church a controversial issue 
in western countries particularly the united states 
but it will likely have a significant effect since it provides 
the theoretical framework for decisions on women during the rest of 
john pauls papacy 
mulieris dignitatem latin for on the dignity of women 
is in the form of an apostolic letter meaning that it is intended 
as church teaching but is not considered infallible 
in the introduction the pope said he is responding to a call by 
a bishops synod last year for further theological and 
anthropological study of what it means to be a man or woman 
it is only by beginning from these bases that one is able 
to speak of their womens active presence in the church and in 
society he wrote 
john paul concluded that the sexes are equal but fundamentally 
different and that women are distinguished by such feminine 
characteristics as sensitivity to other people 
he says women particularly fulfill their vocation through 
motherhood either actual childrearing or spiritual 
motherhood in which some women such as nuns remain celibate 
and devote themselves to other people 
vatican officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
pope regarded the document as a very personal statement and 
apparently did not consult outside experts on it 
it came as the vatican is facing increasing pressure from women 
for a greater role in the church the womens issue dominated the 
1987 synod and has arisen recently with the ordination of a woman 
bishop in the episcopal church in the united states a move the 
vatican has described as a roadblock to christian unity 
in the document the pope emphasizes repeatedly that men and 
women are equal and sexual discrimination is a sin 
the revealed truth concerning the creation of the human being 
as male and female constitutes the principal argument against all 
the objectively injurious and unjust situations which contain and 
express the inheritance of the sin which all human beings bear 
within themselves he wrote 
but he said that womens struggle for equality must not under 
any condition lead to the masculinization of women 
the personal resources of femininity are certainly no less 
than the resources of masculinity they are merely different he 
said 
the pope said men owe a special debt to women who bear their 
children and he denounced men who do not take responsibility for 
their sexual acts 
how often is she abandoned with her pregnancy when the man 
the childs father is unwilling to accept responsibility for it 
the pope wrote 
john paul said women are more sensitive than men and receive a 
special moral and spiritual strength from the awareness that 
god has entrusted to them 
however he said the very difference between femininity and 
masculinity means women should not be priests christ he says 
only chose men to be his apostles and to consecrate the eucharist 
the ceremony that celebrates christs sacrifice of his life for the 
church 
since christ in instituting the eucharist linked it in such 
an explicit way to the priestly service of the apostles it is 
legitimate to conclude that he thereby wished to express the 
relationship between man and woman between what is feminine and 
what is masculine the document said 
the pope rejected the argument that jesus chose men as followers 
because of sociological factors of his day saying that christ had 
a highly unusual rapport with women that did not conform to custom 
the document was more conservative in tone than a draft pastoral 
letter released last spring by us roman catholic bishops the 
draft recommended that women play more of a leadership role in the 
church and suggested that the church be more responsive toward the 
many catholic women who practice artificial birth control 
vatican officials conceded that some women would be disappointed 
in the new document 
i think it will cause a lot of bitterness among women 
especially young women who live in a culture where these arguments 
have fallen apart and been seen for what they are said elisabeth 
schusslerfiorenza a scripture scholar at harvard divinity school

chrysler motors corp repurchased nearly 400 
defective cars under the states lemon law and then allowed 
dealers to resell them without warning buyers of their past 
problems according to state attorney general robert abrams 
the company agreed to make up to 2 million in refunds in a 
settlement with the state abrams said thursday he called the case 
one of the more flagrant violations of the law ive ever seen 
chrysler and american motors a chrysler subsidiary repurchased 
the cars from consumers who won arbitration cases against the 
companies under the lemon law abrams said 
that law defines a car as defective if a problem persists after 
four repair attempts or if a car spends a total of 30 days in a 
dealers garage within 18 months of purchase 
abrams said the company turned around and resold the cars 
without notifying the new buyers of their histories he also said 
chrysler failed to notify the state department of motor vehicles 
that it had repurchased the lemons as required by law that 
would have allowed the agency to issue new titles for the cars that 
would have alerted usedcar buyers of the problems 
consumers who buy cars are entitled to know of the cars lemon 
history said abrams chrysler failed to provide this essential 
information which would have allowed consumers to make an 
intelligent choice 
chrysler which admitted no wrongdoing in settling the case 
agreed to pay the state 100000 in legal costs 
under the settlement chrysler will offer 205 consumers who 
purchased defective cars since last september the option of 
returning the cars for a full refund or accepting a 1000 cash 
payment and a 12month 12000mile service contract 
customers who take the service contract option will be entitled 
to free repair of any exisiting conditions and reimbursement for 
previously documented repairs 
an additional 185 consumers who purchased lemons between aug 2 
1986 and aug 31 1987 will receive 750 cash awards plus the 
service contract free repairs and reimbursement for previous 
repairs 
chrysler will mail notices to car owners by oct 8 and owners 
will have 30 days to exercise their option

firefighters battling an 
arsonset blaze that has burned more than 10000 acres of mountain 
brush and destroyed two homes got a break today as hot dry winds 
died down 
things are looking pretty good california department of 
forestry spokeswoman kathy reiboldt said early today as winds 
calmed to 5 mph from as high as 60 mph thursday 
but she cautioned if the winds come up again we could be in 
trouble 
elsewhere the forecast called for little wind and warm dry 
weather at yellowstone national park and officials said more snow 
will be needed to extinguish the three fires still burning there 
containment is dependent upon weather conditions at this 
point park spokeswoman sandi robinson said thursday 
the number of firefighters in the park has dropped to 1841 from 
a peak of more than 9600 on sept 5 and robinson said the number 
will continue to drop gradually 
the 10660acre texas fire in the san gabriel mountains about 55 
miles east of downtown los angeles was 60 percent contained early 
today ms reiboldt said she would not make any prediction on when 
the fire would be extinguished 
more than 1000 firefighters aided by 10 air tankers and 
helicopters were battling the blaze one of 30 arsoncaused fires 
in the area in recent months 
three people were injured including two prison inmates on a 
firefighting crew who suffered minor burns a resident also was 
treated for smoke inhalation wednesday ms reiboldt said 
the fire destroyed two homes and some chicken coops thursday 
and winds ripping through mountain canyons pushed the flames toward 
1800 homes near the town of etiwanda and within 100 yards of 
evacuated summit elementary school the school remained closed 
today but about 150 residents who were forced to evacuate thursday 
morning were allowed to return to their homes in the afternoon

following are excerpts of mulieris 
dignitatem latin for on the dignity of women an apostolic 
letter issued friday by pope john paul ii they are taken from the 
official englishlanguage text 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this concise passage from genesis contains the fundamental 
anthropological truths man is the high point of the whole order of 
creation in the visible world the human race which takes its 
origin from the calling into existence of man and woman crowns the 
whole work of creation both man and woman are human beings to an 
equal degree both are created in gods image 
the woman cannot become the object of domination and male 
possession 
the revealed truth concerning the creation of the human being as 
male and female constitutes the principal argument against all the 
objectively injurious and unjust situations which contain and 
express the inheritance of the sin which all human beings bear 
within themselves 
in the name of liberation from male domination women must 
not appropriate to themselves male characteristics contrary to 
their own feminine originality there is a wellfounded fear 
that if they take this path women will not reach fulfillment 
but instead will deform and lose what constitutes their essential 
richness 
the personal resources of femininity are certainly no less than 
the resources of masculinity they are merely different hence a 
woman as well as a man must understand her fulfillment as a 
person her dignity and vocation on the basis of these resources 
according to the richness of the femininity which she received on 
the day of creation and which she inherits as an expression of the 
image and likeness of god that is specifically hers 
jesus enters into the concrete and historical situation of 
women a situation which is weighed down by the inheritance of sin 
one of the ways in which this inheritance is expressed is habitual 
discrimination against women in favor of men 
how often the woman pays for her own sin maybe it is she 
in some cases who is guilty of the others sin the sin of 
the man but she alone pays and she pays all alone how often is 
she abandoned with her pregnancy when the man the childs father 
is unwilling to accept responsibility for it and besides the many 
unwed mothers in our society we also must consider all those 
who as a result of various pressures even on the part of the 
guilty man very often get rid of the child before it is born 
motherhood implies from the beginning a special openness to the 
new person and this is precisely the womans part in this 
openness in conceiving and giving birth to a child the woman 
discovers herself through a sincere gift of self 
it is the woman who pays directly for this shared generation 
of a child which literally absorbs the energies of her body and 
soul it is therefore necessary that the man be fully aware that in 
their shared parenthood he owes a special debt to the woman no 
program of equal rights between women and men is valid unless 
it takes this fact fully into account 
this unique contact of a mother with the new human being 
developing within her gives rise to an attitude towards human 
beings not only toward her own child but every human being 
which profoundly marks the womans personality it is commonly 
thought that women are more capable than men of paying attention to 
another person and that motherhood develops this predisposition 
even more 
the gospel puts forward the ideal of the consecration of the 
person that is the persons exclusive dedication to god by virtue 
of the evangelical counsels in particular chastity poverty and 
obedience in this wider context virginity has to be 
considered also as a path for women a path on which they realize 
their womanhood in a way different from marriage 
in calling only men as his apostles christ acted in a 
completely free and sovereign manner in doing so he exercised the 
same freedom with which in all his behavior he emphasized the 
dignity and the vocation of women without conforming to the 
prevailing customs and to the traditions sanctioned by the 
legislation of the time consequently the assumption that he 
called men to be apostles in order to conform with the widespread 
mentality of his times does not at all correspond to christs way 
of acting 
since christ in instituting the eucharist linked it in such an 
explicit way to the priestly service of the apostles it is 
legitimate to conclude that he thereby wished to express the 
relationship between man and woman between what is feminine 
and what is masculine 
it is the eucharist above all that expresses the redemptive act 
of christ the bridegroom toward the church the bride this is clear 
and unambiguous when the sacramental ministry of the eucharist in 
which the priest acts in persona christi is performed by a man 
when the author of the letter to the ephesians calls christ 
the bridegroom and the church the bride he indirectly 
confirms through this analogy the truth about woman as bride the 
bridegroom is the one who loves the bride is loved it is she who 
receives love in order to love in return 
the moral and spiritual strength of a woman is joined to her 
awareness that god entrusts the human being to her in a special way 
a woman is strong because of her awareness of this entrusting 
this awareness and this fundamental vocation speak to women of 
the dignity which they receive from god himself and this makes 
them strong and strengthens their vocation thus the perfect 
woman becomes an irreplaceable support and source of spiritual 
strength for other people 
in our own time the successes of science and technology make it 
possible to attain material wellbeing to a degree hitherto 
unknown while this favors some it pushes others to the edges of 
society in this way unilateral progress can also lead to a 
gradual loss of sensitivity for man in this sense our time in 
particular awaits the manifestation of that genius which 
belongs to women and which can ensure sensitivity for human beings 
in every circumstance

running toward the house when he was grabbed by two officers who

a federal study shows hospitalization rates for 
four major types of cancer have fallen in the 1980s but in some 
cases more people suffer from the diseases 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
hospitalization rates for breast cancer lung cancer colorectal 
cancer and cervical cancer all have declined during the decade 
the hospitalization rates which were derived through 
examination of patient discharge records do not necessarily 
reflect trends in the numbers of people with various cancers said 
dr james mendlein a cdc researcher some cancers may require more 
followup visits than others and the costs of health care also can 
influence numbers of visits he said 
this gives you just one measure of the health care impact of 
various cancers mendlein said 
the drop in hospitalization rates parallel a drop in incidence 
rates for cervical cancer colorectal cancer and male lung cancer 
mendlein said on the other hand while hospitalizations for female 
lung cancer and breast cancer are generally declining somewhat 
incidence of those two diseases continues to rise he said 
for 1986 the latest year for which estimates are available the 
cdc gave hospital discharge rates as 
breast cancer 172 per 100000 people down from a peak of 199 
in 1983 
lung cancer male 142 per 100000 down from a peak of 182 in 
1984 
lung cancer female 83 per 100000 down from a peak of 100 in 
1983 
colorectal cancer 86 per 100000 down from a peak of 92 in 
1981 
cervical cancer 46 per 100000 down fgust

sales of new singlefamily homes in august 
rose a slight 01 percent from the month before pulled up by a 
surge of sales in the midwest the government said today 
the commerce department said sales inched up to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 713000 last month following a 01 percent 
dip in july they had climbed a sharp 47 percent in june 
sales for all three summer months taken together were much 
stronger than analysts had predicted at a time when mortgage 
interest rates were rising economists attributed the brisk sales 
pace to an attempt by home purchasers to buy before interest rates 
went still higher 
interest on fixedrate mortgages which dipped below 10 percent 
in february and march has since climbed to about 105 percent but 
had been expected to rise more steeply 
analysts are still anticipating mortgage rates will increase to 
11 percent by the start of next year and continue up through the 
first half of 1989 
the median price of new homes fell 67 percent in august to 
112000 meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less 
that followed an identical decline in july however the average 
home price rose 20 percent to 145200 in august following a 42 
percent rise in july 
the combination of a drop in the median price and rise in the 
average price likely means more new homes of very high prices are 
being sold skewing the average contractors squeezed by high land 
prices are apparently attempting to sell to affluent purchasers 
looking to trade up rather than to firsttime home buyers 
by region sales rose 109 percent in the midwest to an annual 
sales pace of 102000 units they were up 19 percent in the 
northeast to 107000 units and 03 percent to 287000 units in the 
south 
a 52 percent drop in the west to 217000 units almost offset 
the gains in other regions 
economists say sales are recovering in the midwest with the 
exportdriven resurgence of manufacturing firms sales have been 
hurt on the east and west coasts by high land prices and a scarcity 
of suitable building sites 
for the first eight months of the year new home sales were 14 
percent lower than the same period a year earlier less of a 
dropoff than was anticipated at the beginning of the year

joaquin chino roces a prominent 
newspaper publisher who persuaded corazon aquino to run for 
president died today of complications from cancer his doctor 
announced he was 75 
the doctor cynthia dominquez said roces was admitted to a 
hospital sept 13 for treatment of a pulmonary infection 
roces dean of the philippine press corps launched a campaign 
in 1985 to solicit 1 million signatures on a petition asking mrs 
aquino to run against president ferdinand marcos in february 1986 
mrs aquino the wife of slain opposition leader benigno aquino 
jr at first rejected all suggestions that she run saying she 
knew nothing about being president the signature drive changed her 
mind and mrs aquino went on to claim victory in the election feb 
7 1986 
protests of massive fraud triggered the civilianmilitary 
uprising that toppled the marcos administration on feb 25 1986 
and forced him to flee to exile in hawaii 
roces left journalism in 1972 when marcos closed the manila 
times then the philippines largest newspaper and other media 
when he declared eight years of martial law 
the manila times resumed publication after mrs aquino took 
office because of family differences roces first served as 
publisher of the manila chronicle from 1986 until this year when 
he returned to the manila times 
roces came from one of manilas oldest and wealthiest families 
as publisher of the manila times he was among an elite group 
known as the kingmakers because of the influence they exerted 
over officials and politicians 
roces gave benigno aquino his first job as a correspondent for 
the manila times during the korean war after the young aquino 
promised to pay his own fare to korea 
despite failing health the wiry chainsmoker led street 
demonstrations against marcos that were frequently broken up with 
tear gas and clubcarrying police 
roces remained a strong supporter of mrs aquino but last july 
he lectured the president about the alleged failure of her 
administration to stamp out corruption and bring justice in the 
wake of the marcos era 
roces is survived by his wife pacita and two sons joaquin 
jr and edgardo his daughter rocio died in a landslide in 1984

the departing head of the star wars research 
program said today he decided to leave that job in order to be free 
to come to the defense of the project 
the retirement of lt gen james a abrahamson was announced 
earlier this week by the pentagon 
abrahamson said on abc tvs good morning america that the 
new administration to be elected in november whichever candidate 
wins will undoubtedly want to reassess many programs including 
the strategic defense initiative the formal name for star wars 
when its reexamined with a new administration no matter 
who i believe that ill be in the best position to explain the 
progress of the program the promise of the program if people 
think that im not fighting for my job abrahamson said 
asked the effect of suggestions by democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis that star wars spending should be cut to 
1 billion a year about onefourth of the current level 
abrahamson responded 
i think that would have a tragic result it would 
fundamentally erase the real progress that weve made 
the important thing is that he and other critics around the 
country feel that research should go ahead abrahamson added 
thats a fundamental reaffirmation the fact that they may not 
feel they need to put the amount of money into it is perhaps a lack 
of understanding of the promise of the program and the progress 
as for republican george bush abrahamson said that the vice 
president understands the program he has been strongly committed 
he has given both his moral support and his support in the 
government 
in the next administration the program needs to be represented 
well he said and id like to make that argument without people 
thinking that im trying to enhance my own personal position 
abrahamson who took command of the star wars program in 1984 
will be succeeded by lt gen george l monahan jr

esther martinez of miami 
we admit our mistake and apologize to the family for the

eastern airlines officials tracked down the couple after they

couples home and damaged two homes nearby police said

continue to cooperate with the training exercises but will no 
longer provide lost luggage instead the airline will use dummy 
suitcases for the tests

because aids is more easily spread the 
longer a person is infected with the disease a second wave of 
aids infection may hit the homosexual population a public health 
official warns 
participants at the threeday second national aids conference 
were also told thursday that aids prevention and education programs 
aimed at minority groups will have to come from within the minority 
community to be effective 
efforts to stop transmission among the gay community need to be 
intensified said george rutherford medical director of the aids 
office in the san francisco public health department 
aids is more easily spread the longer a person has been infected 
with the virus he said because the disease has been present in 
the san francisco gay community for almost eight years the number 
of victims in the terminal phase of the disease is increasing 
the risk to gay men per episode of intercourse may be 
increasing said rutherford adding that failure to practice safe 
sex may represent a substantially greater risk as the 
population ages 
this is no time to have a 10 percent failure rate he 
emphasized 
more than 1200 people attended the first day of the conference 
which is designed to provide local public health officials and 
community health advocates with an exchange of information on how 
best to fight the epidemic 
minority communities lack the financial resources and volunteer 
time that have marked the gay communitys response to the crisis 
patricia evans branch chief of education and prevention in the 
aids office of the san francisco department of public health said 
at the conference 
onethird of blacks live in poverty she said adding that its 
very difficult for those individuals to volunteer when they are 
trying to take care of the basic necessities of life 
to be successful aids prevention and education programs aimed 
at minority groups will have to come from within that 
community evans said 
the centers for disease control reported this week that 74447 
cases of aids have been diagnosed since 1981 a total of 41925 
people had died of the disease 
rutherford said a total of 365000 aids cases are expected by 
the end of 1992 more than 263000 people will have died by then 
he said 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a generally 
deadly virus that devastates the bodys immune system leaving 
sufferers susceptible to infections and cancer gay men and 
intravenous drug users have been the primary victims of the 
epidemic

funeral of a vietnam veteran who was shot to death by a policeman 
after killing another officer and three other people near a school 
he wasnt as messed up as people thought said a niece of 
the slain gunman clem henderson 40 
the media didnt really get to the true clem said the 
niece brenda robinson 29 he was always supportive to family 
he was active in painting church murals and he was active in the 
community 
a folded american flag lay next to the body of henderson 
henderson had a history of strange behavior and arrests before 
the sept 23 shooting spree which began at an auto parts store 
the stores manager and an employee were killed along with a 
custodian at the nearby montefiore school for troubled boys before 
henderson encountered two police officers at the schools door 
officer irma ruiz was killed before her partner gregory jaglowski 
shot and killed henderson in an exchange of gunfire jaglowski was 
wounded in the legs 
at mrs ruizs funeral monday the rev james maloney told 
mourners that anger over the killings perhaps should be directed 
at those who are cutting and continue to cut resources for our 
mentally ill 
perhaps that is what killed irma because there was a person 
henderson who needed more help more love and more understanding 
than our institutions provided him maloney said 
ms robinson said her uncle was basically a good man 
he just kept trying to get out of the ghetto she said 
but he just kept winding up there again and again

a former state senator who staged his own 
death and led authorities on a twoyear worldwide manhunt has 
pleaded guilty in a plot to defraud a union pension fund of 20 
million 
david friedland 50 entered the plea to a racketeering count 
thursday before chief us district judge john f gerry 
he has often portrayed himself as a glamorous figure said 
assistant us attorney michael chertoff the truth is there was 
nothing glamorous about him or the crime this was one of the 
grubbiest kinds of crime 
the former jersey city legislator was accused of masterminding a 
plot to defraud the pension fund of north brunswick teamsters local 
701 
were very satisfied that justice was done and he admitted to 
engaging in racketeering said assistant us attorney j imbert 
in return for the guilty plea imbert said the government will 
drop remaining charges including perjury mail and wire fraud 
against friedland when he is sentenced oct 28 
friedland faces a maximum of 20 years in prison 
he had faced up to 150 years in jail if he had been convicted of 
all the original charges 
i think that was a a very good disposition for the government 
and for david said john yacovelle one of friedlands attorneys 
i think hes relieved to get it behind him 
federal authorities say friedland staged a fake drowning in the 
bahamas on labor day 1985 just before he was indicted along with 
three codefendants two union pension fund trustees and the 
funds lawyer he was arrested last december in the maldive islands 
in the indian ocean 
chertoff called the outcome a total victory 
the court and the jury has been spared a significant amount of 
time he said 
the plea agreement came after the testimony thursday of the 
former manager of the pension fund and joseph j higgins 
friedlands partner in omni funding of fort lauderdale fla which 
managed the investments skimmed from the pension fund 
in part as he was confronted with what was unquestionable 
evidence of his guilt i think he was motivated by personal 
embarrassment if nothing else to plead and put an end to the 
proceedings chertoff said a chapter is over in david 
friedlands life

the mother of a 26yearold woman who accuses 
sen brock adams of sexual assault says adams earlier made a pass 
at her while newly released police records in the daughters case 
show no medical evidence of sexual activity or drugs 
sylvia tupper mother of kari tupper who has accused adams 
dwash of drugging and then sexually assaulting her during an 
overnight stay in his washington home said adams propositioned her 
in 1986 the seattle postintelligencer reported today 
the incident occurred during a period when she had lunch with 
him several times with her husbands knowledge the newspaper 
quoted mrs tupper as saying adams and mrs tupper have been 
friends since they both were in student government at the 
university of washington 40 years ago 
kari tuppers sister kathie buckham of seattle said thursday 
night that tupper first told her adams had made a sexual advance 
toward her after a 1985 fundraiser 
on the night in question march 27 1987 ms tupper said she 
had accepted an invitation to go to a restaurant with adams after 
she plotted a strategy to tell the senator to stop propositioning 
her 
i knew the dinner was going to take place the motives 
behind it mrs buckham said we rehearsed it how she was 
going to say it 
adams has denied he made any sexual advances toward ms tupper 
and said she came to his house to discuss her search for a job in 
washington he contends tupper tried to blackmail him for 400000 
but adams said he made a mistake by letting tupper a longtime 
family friend spend the night at his house when his wife was out 
of town 
adams issued a statement to reporters about the episode on 
tuesday he did not accept questions and has refused further 
comment 
police records released thursday in response to a freedom of 
information act request were compiled as part of the district of 
columbia police departments investigation into kari tuppers 
allegations against adams 
they also indicate that prosecutors declined to charge adams in 
part because there were problems with the victims credibility 
the record also shows there were apparently questions raised 
about medical and physical corroboration 
the police file contains a detectives interview with tupper and 
others reports from two hospitals and a statement reflecting the 
decision of the us attorneys office 
much of the file is blacked out to protect the witnesses 
privacy 
tupper a former secretary on capitol hill made a complaint 
against adams in july 1987 nearly four months after she claimed 
that adams put a drug in her drink took her to bed and fondled her 
on the night of march 27 1987 and the next morning 
that morning tupper went to the arlington hospital in suburban 
virginia for tests those tests proved negative for sperm or an 
enzyme found in semen the record shows a urineanalysis 
drugscreening test found only traces of antiinflammatory drugs 
three days later tupper admitted herself for an examination by 
doctors at george washington university medical center claiming 
she had been sexually assaulted a test for semen was not performed 
joseph digenova the us attorney at the time said in an 
interview that the case was handled in a routine fashion by 
prosecutors who determined it had absolutely no merit whatsoever 
zero zip it was nothing 
tupper who is now married has been unavailable for comment 
since the seattle postintelligencer reported the story early in 
the week but her father dr james tupper said his family feels 
betrayed by adams 
kari trusted and respected this man the womans father said 
on wednesday she never believed he would try to hurt or take 
advantage of her 
tupper claimed in her interview with detective patrick shine 
that adams had made sexual advances towards her nearly two years 
before march 27 1987 on that night she wanted to get together 
with adams to ask him to stop harassing me and making me feel 
uncomfortable at receptions the police report said 
adams has said tupper wanted to talk about her employment 
adams and tupper were supposed to meet at a restaurant but 
adams did not show up because her office had told him she was ill 
that day when tupper called his house adams invited her over 
tupper said 
after three drinks tupper said she went to the bathroom feeling 
nauseated that was the last thing she recalled she said 
the next thing that i know for sure happened was that i woke 
up in the morning between 6 and 630 i did not have my clothes 
on he was laying down on my side and he was laying behind 
me she said 
i remember him touching my bare breast and buttocks and i 
tried to sit up and he was pulling me back down into the bed with 
him she said he was turning me over to face him and he was 
kissing me on the lips he was continuing to touch me i was

two film producers charged with child 
pornography can argue that a 16yearold actress used a phony birth 
certificate and other papers that said she was over 18 an appeals 
court has ruled 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals voted 21 thursday to 
reject a government appeal that the producers of those young 
girls starring actress traci lords not be allowed to use a 
mistake defense when they go to trial 
the producers have argued they didnt know lords was only 16 
when they filmed the movie 
beverly hills attorney john weston who represents the 
producers called the ruling a very important opinion and very 
important result reflecting constitutional guarantees of freedom 
of speech and due process 
the government went to the 9th circuit after a us district 
judge in los angeles refused in a pretrial hearing to dismiss the 
charge or strike down the law but ruled that the producers could 
be acquitted if they could prove they reasonably believed lords was 
an adult 
producers ronald kantor and rupert macnee along with talent 
agent james souter jr were charged with violating a federal law 
against production of materials that show a juvenile in sexually 
explicit conduct the crime carries a penalty of up to 10 years in 
prison and a 100000 fine 
souter pleaded guilty but his attorney said he planned to 
withdraw his plea if kantor and macnee got a favorable ruling 
attorneys for the defendants have said lords showed them a 
genuinelooking birth certificate and state identification card 
that indicated she was over 18 they also said they relied on 
lords sophisticated appearance and demeanor 
the twojudge majority said the first amendment is as close to 
an absolute as exists in united states jurisprudence and distaste 
we may feel as individuals toward the content or message of 
protected expression shouldnt sway the courts 
the decision written by judge alex kozinski cited a us 
supreme court ruling striking down an ordinance imposing criminal 
penalties on a bookseller for possession of an obscene book saying 
knowledge of the alleged obscenity was required not allowing a 
reasonable mistake of age defense the 9th circuit said would 
result in a chilling effect on free speech

videos and films

government forces killed at least 76 
people in suppressing unrest this week and today recaptured chinese 
border outposts overrun by communist rebels who back the protests 
a government spokesman said 
also today a representative of rebels of the karen ethnic 
minority said nearly 2000 students and others have fled to areas 
under their control along the thaiburmese border the 
antigovernment refugees hope to receive military training at karen 
bases 
kyaw sann a spokesman for the military government said from 
tuesday to thursday that 76 people were killed as the government 
put down unrest he said 24 others were wounded and 269 were 
arrested 
by official count at least 425 people have been killed since 
hardline gen saw maung seized power sept 18 and ordered troops to 
quell prodemocracy demonstrations throughout the country the 
government says some of those killed were looters 
the new government has promised multiparty general elections 
but opposition leaders have urged people to continue a general 
strike begun aug 8 and fight the government through other peaceful 
means 
antigovernment unrest has swelled this year against 
militarybacked oneparty rule the latest wave began in july when 
it forced ne win from power after 26 years 
kyaw sann also told a news conference that three army outposts 
that fell to rebels of the outlawed burma communist party were 
recaptured today with support from air strikes 
one week ago more than 1500 insurgents attacked and occupied 
positions at lamingone yanshingone and payagone near the chinese 
border about 340 miles northeast of rangoon clashes in the area 
killed at least 131 rebels with 48 government troops dead and 
another 104 wounded the government spokesman said 
kyaw sann said government troops were still carrying out 
moppingup operations against the rebels who have an estimated 
total of 20000 fighters 
the burma communist party earlier issued a statement supporting 
the popular prodemocracy uprising but it was not clear if the 
reported attacks were designed to take pressure off the protesters 
asked about arrests of students who spearheaded the protests 
kyaw sann said 86 remained in custody some students who fled to 
karen outposts said they saw authorities execute protesters 
the karen are among a dozen ethnic groups fighting for greater 
autonomy from the central government the karens who number about 
2 million people first rose up against rangoon in the late 1940s 
the state radio said thursday that about 800 students have 
landed on the wrong path and fled to areas controlled by karen 
as well as other insurgents 
official media meanwhile said conditions were returning to 
normal after the weeks of unrest that crippled the already weak 
economy 
the united nations childrens fund today began a sixday airlift 
with 103 tons of emergency medical supplies for hospitals in burma 
the government said regular passenger service between rangoon to 
the countrys second largest city mandalay would resume sunday 
both local and international air service by burmas government 
airline were to resume saturday

a former millionaire real estate 
developer described by his lawyer as a man of the highest 
integrity has been found guilty of defrauding banks to keep his 
failing company afloat 
john a kroh jr 47 remained impassive as the jury delivered 
the verdict thursday after five hours of deliberations he would 
not comment afterward 
krohs corporation kroh brothers development co was one of 
kansas citys most successful development companies responsible 
for nearly 170 shopping centers residential areas and office 
buildings in 13 states in early 1986 the company was valued at 
nearly 70 million but it went into bankruptcy in february 1987 
kroh also declared personal bankruptcy 
kroh was found guilty of 13 counts of conspiracy bank fraud 
wire fraud receiving stolen money and forging his wifes name on 
loan application papers 
us district judge john whipple said he would set a sentencing 
date within 30 days after receiving a presentence report krohs 
lawyers said they would decide by then whether to appeal 
kroh could receive a maximum sentence of more than 80 years in 
prison and a 325 million fine 
his lead attorney darrell mcgowen of chicago said kroh was a 
decent caring human being 
whether he may stand at this particular moment guilty there 
is a difference between legal and moral guilt mcgowen said 
and he is not morally guilty of the charges 
no family members were in the courtroom when the verdict was 
read including george p kroh 50 who had testified against his 
brother as part of an earlier plea bargain 
george kroh a coowner of the firm served two months of a 
threeyear sentence this summer after pleading guilty to fraud and 
conspiracy 
the government charged that the development company started to 
go downhill in 1986 under the weight of more than 750 million in 
loans and investment financing arrangements that became complicated 
by the 1986 tax changes 
prosecutors said john kroh falsified financial statements to 
banks in late 1986 in order to obtain personal loans 
kroh maintained he never tried to deceive the banks he said he 
had delegated responsibility for filling out the financial 
statements to employees

aids the deadly disease that allows other 
infections to ravage the body is believed responsible for an 
increase in pneumonia deaths among young adults in new york and 
possibly other cities 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
the mortality rate for men 2544 from pneumonia increased in new 
york from four deaths per 100000 people in 1978 before the advent 
of aids to 19 per 100000 in 1987 
for women the rate increased from two per 100000 in 1978 to 
seven in 1987 actual fatality counts were not included in the cdc 
report 
most pneumoniaattributable deaths occur among the elderly 
the cdc said in its weekly report in new york city however the 
number and rate of such deaths among younger persons have increased 
in association with aids infections in intravenous drug abusers 
the records of 192 new yorkers ages 2544 who died with 
pneumonia in 1986 showed that 153 or 80 percent were at high risk 
for aids including 126 intravenous drug abusers fifty had 
possible symptoms of aids and 26 were diagnosed as having aids 
similar trends may be occurring in other cities the cdc 
said 
according to data from 121 large us cities surveyed the 
percentages of deaths attributable to pneumonia and influenza in 
persons 2544 the group most affected by aids increased 
beginning in 1981 in cities with the highest prevalence of aids 
the atlantabased health agency said 
cdc researchers said the number and percentage of pneumoniaflu 
deaths in people 2544 have more than doubled in the cities in the 
top 10 percent for rate of aids cases san francisco miami jersey 
city nj new york newark nj washington paterson nj new 
haven conn trenton nj atlanta elizabeth nj and los 
angeles 
the increases could be due in part to pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia a rare pneumonia that often strikes aids patients the 
cdc said however seven of the top 12 aids cities did not count 
such deaths among their increase in pneumoniaflu fatalities the 
agency noted 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome weakens the bodys 
immune system allowing a variety of diseases to attack including 
pneumonia aids is transmitted most often through sex and through 
contaminated drug needles more than 74000 aids cases have been 
reported in the united states including nearly 20000 in drug 
abusers

floridas first widespread alligator hunting season 
in 26 years ends at midnight tonight the last chance this year for 
hunters to snare a large bull gator that can bring more than 1000 
for its hide and meat 
the end of the 30day season will give some a rest from stalking 
or skinning 
weve been going pretty much straight out all month now were 
going to add everything up and see if it was worth it said grant 
dunaway whose processing plant near immokalee received about 180 
alligators caught by some of the 238 hunters mostly novices who 
won their permits in a state lottery 
dennis david head of alligator monitoring for the state game 
and fresh water fish commission said hide prices on the 
international market have remained stable at 40 to 44 a foot but 
the hunt dropped local gator meat prices about 25 percent to 4 to 
5 a pound 
wildlife officials arent expected to have a final count on the 
hunt in which each hunter had a limit of 15 gators until later 
this year but the original projection was of about 75 percent of 
the maximum 3570 gators 
from what we can see so far that seems to be a pretty good 
guess dennis said 
the impact of the hunt on the states estimated 1 million 
alligators will be studied and new rules for next years hunt could 
be adopted in january dennis said 
some of the possible revisions could be selecting new sites for 
the hunt and loosening regulations to allow people without permits 
to transport gators to processing facilities said dennis 
the state established the hunt in response to a proliferation of 
the oncethreatened species state wildlife experts credit strong 
antipoaching laws adopted in 1970 as the principal reason for a 
twofold population growth in the past 20 years 
the alligator was removed from the federal endangered species 
list in 1977 and since 1981 the state has conducted experimental 
hunts in selected areas with heavy gator populations 
several poachers were caught during the hunt but most 
infractions by permit holders were minor including hunting outside 
designated boundaries and failing to properly tag their catch 
but for the most part were quite pleased with the way the 
hunt was handled said dennis we didnt have anyone bitten 
like people feared 
most novice hunters hired experienced guides and only one 
huntrelated injury has been reported since the season opened sept 
1 
a hunter on lake george in northeast florida lost part of a 
finger when he accidentally discharged a bangstick a device that 
fires a bullet on impact several airboats capsized but no other 
injuries were reported said commission spokesman john white 
in louisiana which opened its 17th annual 30day season sept 
10 23800 gators were taken last year texas which resumed 
alligator hunts in 1984 issued permits for 1500 gators for the 
16day season that ended sept 18

six former secretaries of defense agreed 
today the new openness in the soviet union may provide an 
opportunity for the united states to rethink defense strategies 
but the six said any change in us policy must be done from a 
position of strength 
robert mcnamara melvin laird elliot richardson james 
schlesinger donald rumsfeld and harold brown participated in a 
discussion moderated by television broadcaster edwin newman 
the forum sponsored by the atlantabased southern center for 
international studies was taped and will be shown nov 6 by the 
public broadcasting service 
mcnamara said the united states could reconsider its strategies 
in light of statements by mikhail gorbechev that war between the 
superpowers is no longer an acceptable means of reaching soviet 
goals 
but mcnamara who served as secretary of defense in the kennedy 
and johnson administrations said the united states must probe the 
extent to which the soviets are willing to reduce political tension 
in the western hemisphere and around the world 
we have had enticing statements from mr gorbachev indeed 
enticing statements go back to lenin said schlesinger who 
served under presidents nixon and ford 
it would be imprudent for the united states to reduce its 
forces as long as soviet power needs to be matched he said 
we cant take mere statements by the soviet leadership and 
bank them agreed laird who also served under nixon 
laird said one way the united states could know whether the 
soviets were serious would be to verify a reduction in soviet 
defense spending 
we do have to be careful of how we proceed brown said but 
the united states could also take the initiative in making arms 
reduction proposals said brown who served under president carter 
gorbachev has been making the pace he has been getting the 
credit he said 
it was the second time the former secretaries of defense have 
gathered for a discussion of foreign policy and defense issues in a 
forum sponsored by the southern center for international studies

democrat michael dukakis campaigning in 
rural texas promised today to devote 100 million for investment 
in farm areas and said that his republican presidential rival is 
pursuing an agricultural policy of the fewer farmers the better 
at a rally on a farm in west texas dukakis said that rural 
america is filled with monuments to the neglect and indifference 
and incompetence of mr george bush and his friends 
farms and ranches abandoned or foreclosed banks and hospitals 
shut down storefronts boarded up communities fighting to 
survive 
the democratic presidential nominees emphasis on rural 
development came a day after he and bush traded charges over social 
security specifically whether they had both once supported 
proposals for a oneyear freeze in benefit costofliving 
adjustments 
bush cast a tiebreaking senate vote in favor of such a freeze 
in 1985 dukakis supported a national governors association 
resolution that included such a freeze earlier in the same year 
the massachusetts governor told a news conference in dallas 
thursday that he voted for the nga resolution only after first 
fighting to delete the benefits freeze from it 
at the farm rally dukakis said the republicans put america 
on the auction block theyve been selling off our farms and 
businesses and banks and real estate to the japanese and the saudis 
and the germans and others 
recalling bushs call for a kinder and gentler america in 
his acceptance speech at the republican national convention 
dukakis asked if the vice presidents idea of a kinder and gentler 
america was foreclosing on american farmers letting our small 
towns die 
mr bushs farm policy can be summed up in five words the 
fewer farmers the better and the republican rural development 
policy can be summed up in two words tough luck 
dukakis said that as president he would push for improved rural 
health care and schools and would designate 100 million of his 
proposed fund to rebuild america for investment in rural areas to 
help small businesses get the financing the need to create new jobs 
and to save old ones and to bring the industries of the future to 
the rural towns and counties of this country 
at a news conference in michigan thursday bush struck back on 
the social security issue 
i was a little surprised to see this demogoguery from the man 
who had exactly the same position that the president had on that 
oneyear slipping of the colas the gop nominee said 
throughout the reagan years social security has consistently 
worked as an issue for democrats running against republicans 
dukakis has relished using it against bush 
in speeches he cites bushs plan for a capital gains tax cut 
the vice presidents support for increases in defense spending and 
then says if bush is going to reduce the deficit hows he going 
to do it without raiding the social security trust fund 
the democratic nominee also quotes bush as calling social 
security basically a welfare program a quote that invariably 
draws boos from partisan audiences 
at his news conference bush said i want to keep that social 
security trust fund sound and i will do that and i will not permit 
it to be raided for social spending programs 
for several years the nations governors debated proposals 
urging president reagan and congress to act on the budget deficit 
through a combination of cuts in defense spending and tax increases 
reagan consistently rejected their appeals although in 1985 he 
relented and temporarily endorsed the freeze passed by the senate 
with bipartisan support 
reagan later backed away from his support for including social 
security benefits in the freeze and the whole plan died 
texas sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential 
nominee voted in may 1984 to support a oneyear delay in social 
security colas and in may 1985 he supported a sixmonth delay 
mike mccurry bentsens campaign spokesman said that in may 
1985 the texas senator supported the democratic alternative to an 
underlying republican effort to cut the cola 
the republican are trying to distort the record he said 
they can run but they cant hide

discoverys astronauts achieving 
their crucial task of satellite delivery with considerable 
precision settled into a workmanlike routine today performing 
scientific experiments and taking time out for sightseeing and 
mozart 
the launch and us getting back to space is something that 
really means a lot to me said richard truly the nasa shuttle 
director who supervised the postchallenger recovery and looking 
at todays front pages i think it means a lot to the country 
therell never be another countdown that meant so much he 
said in an abc interview 
with the triumph of thursdays launch behind them the discovery 
crew began its workday 184 miles above the central atlantic just 
after 530 am edt 
mission control supplied a morning wakeup that began with a 
loud and bracing good morning discovery robin williams 
who perfected his deejay routine in the movie good morning 
vietnam prepared the tape for a houston radio station 
the crew learned immediately that the nasa satellite they 
released thursday evening had arrived overnight at it work station 
high above earth 
were there were on orbit were very very happy ed 
bangsund of boeing said today the firm manufactured the rocket 
stage that sent the satellite to its final orbit following the 
challenger accident in 1986 the nations unmanned satellite 
delivery system suffered another series of set backs and no one was 
taking anything for granted 
air force satellite controllers in sunnyvale calif messaged 
the discovery crew that the final velocity shortfall is an 
amazing zeropointone feet per second which mission control 
called a feat of some considerable precision it means the 
satellite was sent into precisely the right orbit 
todays relatively quiet schedule contrasts with the tense drama 
of fire and thunder as discovery rocketed into orbit thursday and 
revived an american space program that had been devastated 32 
months earlier by the explosion of challenger and the death of its 
seven crew members 
we sure appreciate your all getting us up in orbit the way we 
should be discoverys commander frederick h hauck told 
mission control soon after he and his four crew members achieved 
orbit 184 miles above earth 
were looking forward to the next four days we have a lot to 
do and were going to have a lot of fun doing it today the crew 
was asked to photograph some of the natural phenomena of the 
planet earth including pacific thunderstorms a volcano lava 
flow in ethiopia and coastal erosion damage from the hurricane 
gilbert on the yucaton peninsula 
todays flight plan was deliberately conservative to enable the 
crew to carefully check the scores of system modifications made in 
the spacecraft since the challenger explosion were not breaking 
any new ground pilot richard covey said before the launch 
little more than six hours into the mission crewmen john m 
lounge and david c hilmers operating from a panel inside the 
cabin released a 100 million tracking and data relay satellite 
the craft was sprung from a tilttable that raised out of the cargo 
bay and it glided effortlessly into an orbit all its own 
an hour later after hauck and covey maneuvered discovery to a 
safe distance a timing device ignited a rocket attached to the 
giant satellite and propelled it toward a stationary 
22300milehigh orbit a rocket motor that fired early today 
placed it in a circular orbit 
there it will serve as a space switchboard for relaying 
communications between ground stations future shuttle flights and 
up to 25 other orbiting satellites secure channels on board will 
enable the defense department to keep in touch with 
intelligencegathering spacecraft 
nasa and the pentagon considered the satellite so important it 
was scheduled as the cargo for the first postchallenger mission 
an earlier one launched from a shuttle in 1983 is not working 
fully a second was lost in the challenger explosion another is 
set for launch in january 
the flight plan for the remainder of the fourday mission is 
filled with 11 science and technology experiments checks of scores 
of spacecraft modifications and a news conference from space sunday 
todays schedule included turning on a furnace for processing 
materials photographing lightning in the atmosphere and testing 
the effect of weightlessness on red blood cells 
in charge of the experiments is astronomerturnedastronaut 
george d nelson who said he planned to spend much of his leisure 
time stargazing each astronaut brought music cassettes for quiet 
times the works ranged from willie nelson to mozart the fifth 
crewman is david c hilmers 
during a televised segment from space today nelson and hilmers 
demonstrated an experiment involving cell separation in 
weightlessness hilmers explained it could have medical 
applications such as separating malignant from nonmalignant cells 
in earths gravity when materials like the astronauts are 
testing are mixed the lighter one tends to float to the top 
hilmers said in zero gravity its more like a yoke floating 
inside the egg white 
one of the things this can show said hilmers is the use 
of people in space to look at experiments and see any changes we 
can take pictures if we see unique changes and possibly modify the 
experiment 
discovery is set to land at 1232 pm edt monday on rogers dry 
lake at edwards air force base in california 
ice in vents caused an early problem with a cooling system used 
during launch and reentry to help melt the ice controllers told 
the astronauts to raise the temperature in their primary cooling 
system 
this raised the cabin temperature to the mid80s forcing the 
astronauts to turn up their fans and drink extra water by 4 am 
the cabin was 79 degrees which mission control described as very 
comfortable for them 
the crew will remember the five men and two women of challenger 
in a special way hauck said the nature of the memorial will be 
disclosed sunday 
back on earth officials in and out of the space agency were 
ecstatic thursday about americas return to space 
wow said nasa administrator james c fletcher its been 
a long wait 
everyone certainly stood tall today kennedy space center 
director forrest s mccartney told his launch team 
president reagan saluted the crews bravery and added we ask 
god to bless this important voyage 
launch at 1137 am edt came only after nasa waived weather 
guidelines to allow for flight through some lighterthanusual 
florida winds the 98minute delay simply heightened the tension as 
nasa unveiled a spaceship that underwent more than 400 
modifications since the challenger disaster jan 28 1986 
officials were preparing to analyze the performance of the 
redesigned solid fuel booster rockets a faulty joint was blamed 
for the challengers destruction 
from everything i see everything looks great said jr 
thompson who directed the work from the marshall space flight 
center in alabama 
anxiety was highest thursday as the ship went through a 
30second period of severe aerodynamic stress it was during this 
stage of the flight the challenger rockets failed 
some television viewers reported what they thought was an errant 
flame shooting from the left booster rocket about 90 seconds after 
liftoff

kept home from an elementary school today amid rumors that a 
satanic cult was looking for a blond blueeyed child to kidnap and 
sacrifice 
yesterday we had 52 students out said principal freddie 
keen of wallace heights elementary school in kanawha county 
today were down to 43 and six of them their parents called to 
say they are sick 
the rumors have spread into adjacent putnam county where the 
sheriffs department reported receiving 50 calls from worried 
parents one elementary school secretary said she had received 
numerous calls from parents who wanted to make sure teachers 
watched while students were on the playground or boarded buses 
police say theyve found no evidence to support the rumors but 
some parents say theyve heard rumors that a satanic cult has been 
mutilating dogs and is searching for a blond blueeyed child to 
sacrifice 
ive heard them the parents have heard them keen said 
obviously there are some very concerned and frightened 
children kanawha county schools superintendent richard trumble 
said after thursdays absences from wallace heights 
theres no physical evidence keen said the rumors have 
been going on for weeks 
police agree there is no evidence of a satanic cult 
all the calls we get are checked out said a sheriffs 
deputy but it keeps going back to rumors and rumors we cant 
validate any of this garbage 
trumble met with wallace heights staff thursday and said 
security has been tightened

locks on them trumble said the reality is public schools were 
never really designed to be secure places even in locking the 
doors were concerned about violating the fire codes 
police in neighboring eastern kentucky said in midseptember 
that they fielded thousands of phone calls from residents spooked 
by tales of devil worship and abduction rumors had been reported 
in 25 counties since late july 
most of the rumors were similar to the west virginia ones that 
satan worshipers were looking for blond blueeyed children to 
sacrifice some versions said followers needed to round up several 
children before halloween 
many kentucky officials thought the rumors may have been sparked 
by a july grave robbery in breathitt county in which four adults 
and two juveniles were arrested a pentacle or fivepointed star 
and videotapes and books on the occult were found in a trailer the 
defendants allegedly used for satanic ceremonies 
kanawha county sheriffs capt wt markham said today he was

administration made a visit thursday to the aerospace companys 
burbank plant where 75 employees have filed suit complaining they 
suffer from ailments brought on by exposure to hazardous substances 
used in their topsecret jobs 
a team of military physicians toxic material experts and other 
specialists from the department of defense are expected to be at 
the plant by monday according to an announcement thursday by rep 
howard berman dcalif whose district includes the los angeles 
suburb where the plant is located 
in addition to the lawsuit about 150 employees have filed 
workers compensation claims related to exposure to the chemicals 
the employees some of whom work in lockheeds highly classified 
plant nicknamed the skunk works where the u2 reconnaissance 
planes were built have said the topsecret nature of their jobs

republican george bush received 
endorsements today from northern new jersey law officers and told 
them that a criminal who kills a policeman should pay with his 
life 
the bush campaign hastily added an afternoon stop in 
springfield mass where bush expected to win the support of yet 
another police group in rival michael dukakis home state 
we should have much more sympathy for the victims of crime 
than we have for the criminals and thats the kind of judge ill 
appoint to the federal bench he said 
bush criticized massachusetts prison furlough program again 
and said dukakis had a basic revolving door program for murderers 
who have not even served enough time for parole 
bush said someone convicted of a drugrelated murder or killing 
police officers should pay with his life 
bushs sentiments were echoed by those endorsing him today 
under a bush administration criminals wont get weekend 
furloughs so they can go out and commit more crimes said mike 
adamo president of the paterson policemans benevolent association 
also endorsing bush were the passaic county sheriffs officers 
and correction officers and two small police groups and a firemens 
association 
bush was also scheduled to pick up the endorsement of two 
municipal police unions in springfield a week ago bush was 
endorsed by boston police dukakis countered with a law 
officerpacked rally of his own 
bush praised new jersey gov tom kean for his work on 
environmental problems in new jersey and blasted dukakis on that 
issue 
you try to drink the water out of boston harbor lately dont 
do it he said he did not mention that boston harbor is salt 
water but he poked fun at one of his earlier gaffes 
i may have a little trouble remembering pearl harbor but i 
dont have any trouble remembering boston harbor he said 
bush said thursday that the american people have a right to know 
whether dukakis would heed the advice of the aclu in choosing 
judges for the high court 
i just asked him dukakis to clarify that for us said 
bush who for the first time suggested that the democrat might 
follow the aclus advice i think its a good question to ask 
all he has to say is no they wont have any influence on him 
bush in a speech to a community college in mount clemens 
mich said he wants judges on the court who have a little more 
compassion for the victims of crime and a little less for the 
criminals 
meanwhile bush dismissed as demagoguery dukakis contention 
that the republican candidate would raid the social security 
trust fund to help trim the deficit 
dukakis has cited bushs tiebreaking vote in the senate in 1985 
on a budget resolution that backed a sixmonth freeze on 
costofliving adjustments for social security recipients 
bush said dukakis supported exactly the same thing in a 1985 
meeting of the national governors conference 
dukakis voted against a resolution backing such a freeze the 
first time around but then voted for the overall package of 
resolutions on a final vote 
sheila tate bushs press spokeswoman acknowledged that 
dukakis first vote was cast against the proposed freeze but she 
called that just preliminary skirmishing 
bush said he would keep the social security fund sound and i 
will not permit it to be raided for social spending programs 
the vice president also defended anew his running mate sen dan 
quayle of indiana 
i think its rather demeaning for their head of the ticket to 
keep going after dan quayle bush said it shows a certain 
insecurity a certain weakness on his dukakis part 
in another development the los angeles times reported today 
that bush during his tenure as cia director fought the justice 
departments criminal investigation of senior cia officials 
including former director richard helms and an inquiry into the 
agencys operations in chile during the early 1970s 
the newspaper citing newly released files in the gerald r ford 
presidential library in ann arbor mich said bush sought to 
prevent some documents from being declassified and witnesses from 
being called before a federal grand jury former president ford 
later instructed bush to let federal prosecutors have what they 
needed 
in 1977 helms pleaded no contest to two criminal charges of 
failing to testify fully completely and accurately to congress 
mark goodin a bush spokesman had no comment on the report 
earlier thursday bush applauded the successful launch of the 
space shuttle discovery and pledged his support for space 
programs but the gop nominee said if elected he would not engage 
the soviets in a race to the planets 
i dont think we just need to race if they the soviets go 
to planet x we have to be at planet x sooner bush said i 
think the next major responsibility of the president is to sit down 
with the specialists after this flight and talk about what should 
the priority be 
bush told reporters he opposes a manned flight to mars at this 
time given current budget constraints 
bush plans to attend the return of discovery on monday 
aides to the vice president said bush made the decision after a 
phone call to president reagan on thursday shortly after the launch

the house today approved 32777 a bill to pay 
for pentagon programs hours after the white house announced 
president reagan had signed separate legislation authorizing the 
defense departments budget 
the actions were part of an agreement between the 
democraticcontrolled congress and the white house as congress 
tried to finish a crowded agenda of spending bills needed before a 
new fiscal year begins saturday 
the senate was expected to vote later on the bill appropriating 
money for the pentagon the complicated federal budget process 
involves legislation to authorize programs followed by separate 
bills to actually provide the money needed to pay those bills 
the measure signed by reagan is similar to one he vetoed last 
month but restores the defense spending priorities he requested in 
a veto message 
because of that aug 3 veto congressional leaders said they 
wouldnt vote on the defense appropriation bill until reagan first 
signed the authorizing measure the authorization and appropriation 
bills are virtually identical 
the bill signed by reagan was approved by the house 36948 on 
wednesday afternoon three hours later the senate passed it 914 
the measure authorizes the pentagon to spend 300 billion in the 
fiscal year beginning saturday the same total contained in the 
bill reagan vetoed aug 3 that represents a slight cut from this 
years 301 billion defense budget 
the appropriation bill is for 282 billion in the fiscal year 
starting saturday the total is smaller because some of the 
programs in the authorization measure are in future years 
the bills include a 41 percent pay raise for the nations 21 
million uniformed military personnel 
while both bills contain the same reductions in reagans 
proposed star wars budget as the bill he vetoed the earlier bills 
congressionally mandated restrictions on internal spending in the 
star wars program were removed 
the strategic defense initiative as the star wars antimissile 
research program is formally known would receive 41 billion 
compared to the 48 billion sought by reagan and the 39 billion 
authorized for this year 
the pentagon wanted to spend up to 330 million of the sdi money 
on a spacebased interceptor weapon the first stage of an early 
deployment sdi program the previous measure would have restricted 
that to 85 million but the new measure removes that limit 
the new bills also remove a restriction on flight testing of 
depressed trajectory missiles which fly relatively low instead 
of into space as do other longrange atomic missiles the united 
states has none of the weapons under development and no plans for 
testing but the soviets are believed to be developing the weapons 
the new bills also rewrote the complicated spending plan for the 
mx and midgetman nuclear missiles two weapons at the heart of a 
dispute over the future of americas landbased nuclear missile 
force 
the original bill proposed spending 250 million each for 
studies of the midgetman and a railroadbased version of the mx and 
provided another 250 million to be used for either program next 
year by the next president 
the new bills provide 250 million for the midgetman and 600 
million for the mxonrails program but say no more than 250 
million of the mx money can be spent before feb 15 the remaining 
350 million could be reallocated by whomever wins the presidency

of a hospital psychiatric unit during the past eight months 
retired probate judge rosemary m trakas said wilsons family

its a confidentiality statute 
wilson told the state newspaper of columbia that during the

children of the second death because they felt it would be better 
if the parents broke the news

feelings he said several teachers felt they saw a lot of 
anger

the police department has lifted a fouryear ban 
on the glock handgun which critics have called a potential 
terrorist weapon out of fear that its plastic parts would make it 
difficult to detect 
department tests indicated that this is not one of the 
undetectable plastic weapons said robert goldman deputy 
commissioner for legal matters 
the department which has tested the lightweight semiautomatic 
pistol for several years made the decision thursday in connection 
with an appeal filed in march by a gun enthusiast goldman said 
the departments top lawyer admitted the timing of the decision 
was precipitated by the publicity generated by an associated press 
report wednesday that police commissioner benjamin ward was 
licensed to carry the 9mm weapon 
perhaps i would have made this decision next week goldman 
said rather than keep a controversy going you know why this 
and why that well give you the answers up front 
city residents will now be able to apply for permits to own the 
guns and they may also be issued to police officers in the 
departments narcotics intelligence and emergency service units 
the guns clip can hold up to 17 rounds of ammunition compared 
to the policeauthorized 38caliber revolvers which hold six 
rounds 
the department originally banned the gun because it seemed 
very prudent not to jump and summarily authorize something that on 
its surface appeared to be a plastic weapon he said thats 
the way the glock was advertised thats the way it was perceived 
the department started testing the austrianmade weapon which 
retails for about 500 in 1986 it has a plastic frame but the 
barrel and some other parts are metal it has a 4inch barrel and 
weighs about 24 ounces with an empty clip 
initially there was concern that the weapon could not be 
detected by magnetic and xray devices such as those used at 
airports 
police sources speaking on the condition they not be 
identified described the commissioner as embarrassed and upset 
after the ap reported that a copy of wards gun license dated july 
6 showed he had a glock 
ward said tuesday that death threats prompted him to carry a 
weapon and sometimes a machine gun wherever he goes 
so far ward is the only person in the police department 
authorized to carry the departmentowned weapon and the only 
person in new york city registered to possess the glock one of a 
dozen owned by the department

michael dukakis attacking george bush in rural texas said 
today republican policy on hardpressed farmers and ranchers can 
be summed up in two words tough luck bush in turn called 
dukakis homestate prisoner furlough program a revolving door for 
murderers 
the latest tough talk from the presidential candidates came one 
day after they exchanged longdistance rhetorical barbs over social 
security and other issues 
dukakis told a crowd at a farm rally in idalou texas that if 
he is elected he will devote 100 million for investment in farm 
areas 
recalling bushs call for a kinder and gentler america in 
his acceptance speech at the republican national convention 
dukakis asked if the vice presidents idea of a kinder and gentler 
america was foreclosing on american farmers letting our small 
towns die 
mr bushs farm policy can be summed up in five words the 
fewer farmers the better and the republican rural development 
policy can be summed up in two words tough luck 
dukakis said rural america is filled with monuments to the 
neglect and indifference and incompetence of mr bush and his 
friends farms and ranches abandoned or foreclosed banks and 
hospitals shut down storefronts boarded up communities fighting 
to survive 
bush traveled to paterson nj to pick up the endorsement of 
local law enforcement officers and also planned later in the day 
to accept the endorsement of a springfield mass police group 
his second such trip to massachusetts in an effort to tweak dukakis 
we should have much more sympathy for the victims of crime 
than we have for the criminals and thats the kind of judge ill 
appoint to the federal bench bush said speaking from the steps 
of the paterson municipal complex 
he said dukakis as governor of massachusetts had a basic 
revolving door program for murderers who have not even served 
enough time for parole 
president reagan was back on the campaign trail for his vice 
president taking up bushs attack on dukakis membership in the 
american civil liberties union in a speech prepared for delivery 
in chicago reagan said you recall a few years back political 
figures had to disassociate themselves from groups on the right 
with farout views isnt it now time for responsible people to do 
the same thing with farout groups on the left 
meanwhile a new gallup poll taken tuesday and wednesday among 
1020 registered voters said bush was favored by 47 percent to 
dukakis 42 percent the poll had a 3 percent plusorminus margin 
of potential sampling error 
on thursday bush dismissed dukakis criticisms of the 
republican nominees vote to freeze social security benefits 
citing a similar stance by the democrat three years ago 
the gop presidential nominee turning the tables on an issue the 
democrats have used against him said thursday that at the national 
governors association meeting in february 1985 dukakis voted for a 
resolution calling for an overall freeze of social security 
benefits 
dukakis has criticized bush for casting a tiebreaking senate 
vote in may 1985 to approve legislation that included a oneyear 
freeze on social security costofliving adjustments 
he supported exactly the same thing he was attacking me on the 
other night bush said referring to charges dukakis leveled 
during sunday nights debate 
the massachusetts governor acknowledged thursday that he cast 
his vote for the resolution but noted that initially he supported 
a proposal to delete social security from a list of programs to be 
covered by a oneyear freeze 
the two vice presidential candidates republican dan quayle and 
democrat lloyd bentsen were devoting much of their time to 
preparing for their debate wednesday in omaha neb 
bentsen was addressing a rally in charlotte nc and the 
national education association in washington dc quayle was 
spending the day poring over debate briefing books and meeting with 
advisers before traveling to philadelphia tonight for the great 
american firehouse exposition and muster 
after a day of trading oneliners bush lashed out at dukakis 
for suggesting that the gop nominee would raid the social 
security trust fund to cut the federal deficit 
i was a little surprised to see this demagoguery from the man 
who had exactly the same position that the president had on that 
oneyear slipping of the colas the vice president said 
dukakis said he voted for the overall freeze after the effort to 
protect social security increases failed the democratic nominee 
said the vote was a general expression of my concern for the 
deficit but i made it very very clear that i was opposed to 
cutting costofliving increases for social security recipients 
earlier in the day dukakis attacked the reagan administrations 
record on the environment using an appearance at rutgers 
university in new brunswick nj to denounce republican efforts 
to cleanup toxic waste sites and stem the tide of medical wastes 
washing up on new jersey shores 
for the footdraggers and chronic polluters i have just one 
message dukakis said you better vote for mr bush because if 
im elected the game is over no more of the sweetheart deals and 
delayed cleanups and halfbaked compromises that weve seen over 
the past seven and a half years 
several weeks ago bush had traveled to new jersey where he 
proclaimed i am an environmentalist 
calling george bush an environmentalist is like calling dan 
quayle a statesman said dukakis who was joined by a 
conservationist who bristles at comments on his resemblance to 
quayle actor robert redford

that was hoped to achieve peace but was followed by war within a

his speech was scheduled only a few hours after he signed a 300 
billion defense appropriation bill after congress voted changes 
that caused him to veto the measure in august 
taking up vice president george bushs antiliberal cudgel 
reagan said that democrat michael dukakis performance in last 
sundays debate was what could be expected from an american civil 
liberties union member he didnt have a prayer 
questioning the positions of the aclu reagan added you

a federal judge today found the fbi guilty 
of discriminating against its hispanic agents in promotions and 
working conditions 
ruling in a lawsuit brought by most of the agencys hispanic 
agents us district judge lucius bunton said in a summary of his 
opinion this court has found a pattern of practice of 
discrimination and condition of employment in promotional 
opportunities as to the plaintiffs class 
however bunton did not find that the fbi had retaliated against 
those involved in the lawsuit according to the summary attached 
to his 97page opinion 
were very elated said hugo rodriguez attorney for the 
plaintiffs were very happy 
chris clark an fbi attorney had no immediate comment the 
decision will be forwarded to fbi headquarters and officials may 
have a comment later he said 
earlier the director of a hispanic group said he planned to ask 
congress to investigate the fbi regardless of the outcome of the 
class action 
the lawsuit was filed by el paso agent bernardo matt perez 
and 310 other hispanic agents who contended the fbi discriminates 
against them in promotion discipline and assignments they asked 
for unspecified damages and changes in fbi policies 
the fbis 437 hispanic agents comprise about 45 percent of the 
9574 agents hispanics make up about 8 percent of the general us 
population 
attorneys for perez have said a favorable ruling could affect 
fbi employment practices nationwide 
during the twoweek nonjury trial in august about 30 agents 
testified that hispanics are given lessdesirable assignments are 
afforded less recognition for their successes and are not promoted 
as quickly as nonhispanic agents 
jose de lara national director of the league of united latin 
american citizens said this week he would ask for an investigation 
into the fbi regardless of the decision 
either way i will be calling on congress to hold oversight 
hearings on employment practices and attitudes because obviously 
something is wrong de lara said 
he said he would ask rep jack brooks dtexas to launch the 
investigation next year if he is appointed chairman of the house 
judiciary committee as expected 
de lara added he would ask to meet with fbi director william 
sessions who was appointed after the suit was filed in january 
1987 before he was named fbi director in the summer of 1987

president andrei a gromyko the stonefaced 
diplomat who served kremlin leaders from josef stalin to mikhail s 
gorbachev retired from the politburo today in a move that likely 
set the stage for his removal from the presidency 
gromykos retirement came on the first day of a meeting of the 
policymaking communist party central committee and one day before 
a special session of the supreme soviet the nations nominal 
parliament 
his retirement from the presidents post could clear the way for 
gorbachev to assume the presidency in a reorganization of communist 
party and government functions 
the shakeup in the kremlin hierarchy virtually removed 
holdovers appointed by gorbachevs predecessors 
there was initial confusion over gromykos status in his speech 
to the session gorbachev said gromyko had requested he be allowed 
to retire on pension indicating he would step down from the 
politburo and the presidency 
but it appeared that gromyko could ask the party central 
committee only to relieve him of his politburo job the question of 
whether he will remain as head of state could be be taken up only 
by the parliament at saturdays meeting 
vadim a medvedev centrtal committee spokesman said gromyko 
had been thinking of retiring for some time and asked to be 
relieved of his duties 
gorbachev lauded the the merits and achievements of gromyko 
who served as soviet foreign minister for 27 years before becoming 
president in july 1985 
tass the soviet news agency said gorbachev told the central 
committee that gromyko had submitted a request saying that at his 
age the only sensible decision for me is to retire 
his statement said he wanted to go every day in the common 
rank together with the entire party with the entire people 
generally speaking it has been a rich political life 
gorbachev said i would like to thank him for the great work 
and faithful service for the party and the state and to wish him 
good health 
the 79yearold gromyko is a skillful and tough diplomat who 
represented the kremlin in negotiations with western leaders from 
winston churchill to president jimmy carter 
he taught the west the meaning of the russian word nyet 
during the cold war but quickly accommodated himself to detente in 
the 1970s and was considered a key supporter when gorbachev assumed 
the leadership of the communist party in 1985 
many have called him grim grom or old stoneface he 
outlasted stalin nikita s khrushchev leonid i brezhnev yuri v 
andropov and kostantin u chernenko all leaders of the soviet 
union 
his long tenure attests to a competence that enabled him to 
survive the political upheavals in the soviet union 
as a thoroughly professional practitioner of the diplomatic 
trade he has few peers in the modern world cyrus r vance then 
the us secretary of state said in 1978 
gromyko served as a loyal foreign minister to all soviet 
leaders but during andropovs leadership in 198284 gromykos 
star rose in march 1983 he became first deputy premier in 
addition to his post as foreign minister and member of the 
politburo 
tass once said he took part in the most important foreign 
political developments of our time 
gromyko held some of his governments most demanding posts and 
attended every ussoviet summit except the one in november 1985 
between gorbachev and president reagan that was because he no 
longer was foreign minister 
gromyko was named ambassador to the united states in 1943 at the 
age of 34 
he attended the conferences of the allies in tehran potsdam and 
yalta where stalin president franklin d roosevelt prime minister 
winston churchill of britain and chiang kaishek of china made 
important wartime and postwar decisions 
in 1946 gromyko was named the soviet unions permament 
representative to the united nations the world body he helped 
found during his years in washington 
in his three years as a permanent representative on the un 
security council gromyko cast 26 vetoes sounding out his nyet 
when it came his turn to vote 
he gained the sobriquet old stoneface in 1960 when 
khrushchev raucously banged his shoe on his desk during a un 
general assembly session startling everyone in the hall except 
gromyko who sat silently staring ahead 
in june a delegate to the communist party conference bluntly 
criticized gromyko and other longtime officeholders suggesting 
there was highlevel support for removing them from office

a federal appeals court today dismissed an 
attempt by oliver l north and two other irancontra defendants to 
scuttle charges they illegally diverted iranian armssale proceeds 
to the nicaraguan rebels 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals here 
rejected as premature the appeal of us district judge gerhard a 
gesells refusal to dismiss charges against north a former white 
house aide exnational security adviser john poindexter and arms 
dealer albert hakim 
the appeals court said it does not have the jurisdiction until 
the three defendants are tried to consider claims that the 
congressional testimony they gave under limited immunity from 
prosecution had been illegally used against them 
such claims could be raised if the three defendants are 
convicted and file appeals the court said 
the court also dismissed a petition by the defendants who were 
joined by the american civil liberties union asking that gesell be 
ordered to dismiss the charges or hold additional pretrial 
hearings on the immunity issue 
north poindexter and hakim had contended that the pervasive 
publicity that resulted from their congressional testimony 
inevitably tainted the grand jury that indicted them in march 
the three who were compelled to testify before the house and 
senate irancontra committees under socalled use immunity 
argued that given the widespread publicity their testimony was 
inevitably used against them in violation of their constitutional 
rights against selfincrimination 
under the law the immunized testimony of a witness granted 
use immunity cannot be used against him as evidence 
the three defendants asked the appeals court to order gesell to 
dismiss the indictment or to hold pretrial hearings to more fully 
explore whether grand jurors or witnesses before the secret panel 
had been exposed to tainted evidence 
gesell refused to dismiss the indictment and held only 
preliminary hearings on the issue of grand jury taint saying the 
matter could be taken up at posttrial hearings 
the appeals court in an unsigned opinion said it could not 
rule on the issues until after any convictions are appealed 
the defendants have failed to demonstrated how the remedy 
afforded by direct appeal will be clearly inadequate to correct 
the perceived wrong the appeals court said 
if appellants are correct in their assertion of unfairly 
prejudicial error and those errors are properly preserved for 
appeal vacation of the judgment of conviction and dismissal of the 
indictment will provide a full and fair remedy to appellants the 
court said 
appellants may ultimately be correct in their assertion that 
if the grand jurys probable cause determination was tainted by 
the use of immunized testimony dismissal of the indictment will be 
required to remedy the harm said circuit judges james l 
buckley douglas h ginsburg and david sentelle 
but the panel noted that the supreme court frowns on piecemeal 
or socalled interlocutory appeals in the middle of a proceeding 
even when vindication of the defendants rights requires 
dismissal of the charge altogether however an interlocutory 
appeal is not automatically justified the court said 
if the claimed error will not be important enough to warrant 
correction on appeal from final judgment it most assuredly is not 
important enough to warrant the extraordinary step of an 
interlocutory appeal the court said 
gesell has ordered separate trials for north poindexter and 
hakim a fourth defendant in the case arms dealer richard v 
secord testified on capitol hill without immunity from prosecution 
and therefore was not part of the legal challenge secord will also 
be tried separately 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh has elected to try north 
first but the trial is not expected to begin until next year 
gesell postponed the trial indefinitely to give prosecutors 
additional time to process massive numbers of classified documents 
that north may be entitled to use for his defense 
in a statement following todays ruling walsh said the court 
of appeals decision is most welcome and permits us to concentrate 
on pursuing the cases awaiting trial

chinas grip on tibet appears firmer than ever 
one year after longsuppressed hatred of chinese rule erupted in a 
violent protest that left at least 14 people dead 
one year ago saturday about 2000 tibetans led by buddhist 
monks burned a police station in lhasa capital of the himalayan 
nation and attacked police in the bloodiest uprising since an 
abortive bid for independence in 1959 
a second violent protest broke out at a buddhist ceremony on 
march 5 with 24 killed by unofficial count in daylong clashes 
with police small peaceful protests quickly ended by police also 
were held sept 26 oct 6 and several times since 
but it was the violence of oct 1 chinas national day that 
brought the greatest international criticism of communist chinas 
38year rule in tibet including a condemnation by the us senate 
china appears determined to head off any commemoration 
a few monks who tried to chant proindependence slogans in 
lhasas main square on tuesday were quickly hustled away and the 
area was briefly closed to foreigners western travelers in lhasa 
reported no other details were available 
nobody is allowed to use religious activities to disrupt 
public order damage peoples health or disturb education mao 
rubai vice chairman of the tibetan regional government said last 
week in an interview with two foreign reporters 
religion and nationalism are inseparable in tibet which before 
chinas red army entered in 1950 was effectively ruled by buddhist 
monks headed by the dalai lama tibetan buddhisms holiest figure 
the independence protests have been led by monks demanding the 
return of the dalai lama who fled to india in 1959 
maos two interviewers from the us cable news network and the 
sydney morning herald of australia were among the few foreign 
journalists allowed to visit tibet since the protests authorities 
expelled from lhasa 14 foreign reporters who were covering last 
years oct 1 protest and since have barred dozens of journalists 
from entering 
sketchy reports from lhasa indicate the chinese plan to be 
prepared this year 
an asian diplomat based in beijing speaking on condition of 
anonymity said additional chinese troops recently were posted to 
the already heavily garrisoned region in what he said was 
obviously a lawandorder measure 
western travelers in lhasa who also spoke anonymously said 
security forces have been posted at night in buddhist monasteries 
for the past few weeks to keep watch over the nationalist monks 
they said an 1130 pm curfew took effect last saturday for 
foreign tourists mostly restricted to group tours since the 
protests 
there were no signs that tibetans planned any action on oct 1 
only the usual whispers from monks and pilgrims in broken english 
we hate chinese dalai lama come back 
in april china invited the dalai lama to come back and live in 
tibet if he renounced independence for the region 
last week china made a second overture inviting the dalai lama 
to hold a direct dialogue at the place of his choice it still 
insisted he renounce independence and made no new concessions 
the dalai lama agreed to talks but the matter stalemated when 
he said they should be based on his june proposal in strasbourg 
france that china give tibet domestic autonomy while still 
handling its foreign affairs and stationing troops there 
china unwilling to compromise on its 700yearold claim to 
sovereignty over tibet rejected the strasbourg plan 
chinas latest overture appeared timed to assure tibetans and 
foreigners of its peaceful intentions before the oct 1 
anniversary but it also highlighted one result of the past years 
protests 
the violence could not shake chinese control but it apparently 
did convince chinese leaders that real calm in tibet cannot be 
achieved without some kind of settlement with the man they long 
denounced as a separatist

doctors gave emperor hirohito blood for the eighth 
straight day friday as he continued to bleed internally former 
president jimmy carter visited the imperial palace to wish the 
monarch a speedy recovery 
doctors said the worlds longest reigning living monarch was in 
stable condition 
carter and his wife rosalynn were among thousands of 
wellwishers who braved a cold rain to visit the palace carter 
signed his name in a registry but did not see the 87yearold 
emperor 
the former president arrived in japan wednesday for a fiveday 
visit to attend the japan junior chamber of commerces annual 
convention 
hirohito has been under intensive care by a team of court 
physicians since he vomited blood sept 19 few people other than 
family members have been allowed to see him 
since that day the emperor has received more than eight pints 
of blood or more than twothirds the normal amount of blood in his 
body news reports said 
doctors on thursday began administering blood with the white 
corpuscles removed such transfusions are aimed at preventing a 
reaction to the white blood cells imperial household agency 
spokesman kenji maeda said 
the emperor remains in stable condition as a whole though 
slight traces of blood were detected friday morning maeda told 
palace reporters 
maeda said hirohitos temperature was 997 degrees compared 
with his normal reading of 959 degrees 
gray skies and rain once again blanketed tokyo as they have 
every day since the emperors condition worsened and hirohito 
asked a visitor what the weather was like in south korea where the 
olympics are being held maeda said 
the imperial spokesman said the emperor also complained of 
feeling hungry he has not been able to eat or drink anything for 
10 days except for two small ice cubes sept 22 and is being fed 
intravenously 
local news reports have said the emperor has intestinal cancer 
but palace officials have neither confirmed nor denied the reports 
they have urged the media to refrain from such speculation 
throughout japan organizers continued to cancel dozens of local 
festivals concerts and fall athletic meets because of the 
emperors illness but government officials said such cancellations 
should not be overdone 
at the us air forces yokota air base officials said they 
were postponing the annual japaneseamerican friendship festival 
because of the emperors health 
the essence of the annual event is to express our friendship 
for our japanese hosts col richard t swope 475th air base 
wing commander said in a statement as an extension of that 
friendship we are postponing the festival until further notice 
but prime minister noboru takeshita urged that a national 
athletic meet be held in kyoto as scheduled and sports officials 
said each school should decide whether to hold sports events news 
reports said 
organizations opposed to the emperor system such as the japan 
communist party have criticized what they say is pressure on 
groups to cancel normally scheduled events 
under japans postwar constitution the emperor is a symbolic 
head of state with little real power his duties include placing an 
official seal on documents and government appointments on the 
advice of the cabinet

form the oldest we had was a 101yearold man who said hed never 
voted in a presidential election before said catherine 
carnatios one 20 volunteers for the friends of michael dukakis 
organization 
since the produkakis organization started up in august more 
than 20000 americans of greek descent have filled out ballot 
applications at 14 offices scattered around mainland greece and the 
islands its members said 
theyre not looking to help elect a greek president wholl 
solve the problems of the patrida but they do have the idea of 
the american dream coming true the son of immigrants becoming 
president nikos rezevoulis the groups chairman said in an 
interview 
the massachusetts governor whose parents both were born in 
greece has stressed his immigrant background thorughout his 
presidential campaign earning approval from greeks and greek 
americans even if theyre not democrats 
win or lose dukakis has given the greek image a boost hes 
shown greeks can be hardworking and efficient which hasnt been 
part of their image outside the united states said dimitris 
katsoudas who heads a conservative think tank in athens 
dukakis candidacy has encouraged many older greek americans to 
apply for ballots retirees make up at least onethird of an 
estimated 75000 american citizens living in greece according to 
the dukakis organization 
the organization provides wouldbe voters with ballot forms and 
volunteers help make sure they are correctly filled out 
the forms also are available at the american embassy but mrs 
carnatios said people can be a bit shy about requesting 
assistance from officials so they often prefer to ask us about the 
details 
other greecebased voters are mostly students and businessmen 
and their families who divide their time between greece and the 
united states and some are registered republicans 
i registered as a republican back in the sixties but now i 
want to vote for dukakis both for his policies and because im 
proud of him said apollo sakell a 53yearold former civil 
servant from leroy new york

residential districts of the capital where many greek americans

protesters hurled firebombs into us 
army headquarters friday in an escalating antiamerican campaign 
us and south korean authorities said no damage was reported 
the attack followed an outburst of antius sentiment spurred 
by incidents involving american athletes and news media during the 
olympics the games which began sept 17 end sunday 
police and us military authorities said a band of youths 
believed to be radical students tossed firebombs over a wall into 
a motor pool at the headquarters of the 8th us army near central 
seoul police said nine people involved in the attack fled 
newspapers and yonhap the south korean news agency said the 
attack involved at least 20 youths who threw at least four 
firebombs from an elevated walkway and left 15 more behind 
it was the second firebomb attack on us armed forces 
facilities this year a us military spokesman said a window was 
broken in the first attack the spokesman said without elaborating 
president roh taewoo and other top officials this week called 
on south koreans to stop criticizing the united states and to 
remember the nations close ties 
in recent years radical students have staged violent antius 
protests and us facilities including american cultural centers 
have been the targets of occasional firebomb attacks 
radical students demand the withdrawal of the 42000 us troops 
stationed in south korea under a mutual defense pact they contend 
us forces enforce the division of the korean peninsula with north 
korea 
in southern seoul about 250 students marched off kyongwon 
university after an antius antiolympic rally on friday and 
occupied a highway leading to a nearby olympic stadium for field 
hockey yonhap said the students dispersed voluntarily as their 
protest caused traffic congestion for a halfhour 
about 50 students with firebombs and clubs held an antius 
rally at dongguk university in downtown seoul the campus was 
tightly guarded by riot police but there was no clash 
also friday a group of students delivered a letter to the us 
embassy protesting the behavior of american athletes and 
journalists during the olympics 
south korean newspapers have atacked us news media especially 
nbctv for coverage of an attack by south korean boxing officials 
on a new zealand referee who awarded a match against a local 
favorite 
but roh has defended nbcs coverage saying even if the 
reports of nbc included something that hurt our selfesteem we 
should put up with it since most of the networks reports were 
affirmative 
further criticism was provoked by the conduct of some us 
athletes said to have acted rudely at the games opening ceremony 
and other events and the arrest of two american swimmers for 
stealing a lions head ornament from a seoul hotel 
the incidents are clear evidence that americans are slighting 
the korean people the students letter said 
but the vehemently anticommunist officials who initially 
played a role in criticizing american behavior also have become 
alarmed with south koreans who have shown a growing public interest 
in the soviet union 
citizens seemed enraptured by their first encounter with soviet 
athletes and officials soviet ballet and cultural offerings 
during the olympics sold out soviet goods disappeared in minutes 
at stores and soviet athletes were praised for their dignified 
conduct 
government officials said it was hard to believe many south 
koreans would admire the soviet union a longhated enemy that shot 
down a south korean jetliner in 1983

the army recaptured outposts along the 
chinese border from communist rebels and killed at least 76 people 
in suppressing unrest elsewhere this week a government spokeman 
said friday 
by official count at least 425 people have been killed since 
hardline gen saw maung seized power sept 18 and ordered troops 
to put down demonstrators throughout the country 
three army outposts that fell to rebels of the outlawed burma 
communist party were recaptured friday with support from air 
strikes government spokesman kyaw sann told a press conference 
more than 1500 insurgents on sept 23 attacked and occupied 
positions at lamingone yanshingone and payagone near the chinese 
border about 340 miles northeast of rangoon in ensuing clashes at 
least 131 rebels and 48 soldiers were killed and 104 wounded 
officials said 
kyaw sann said moppingup operations were continuing the 
communists are believed to have some 20000 guerrillas under arms 
the communist party earlier issued a statement supporting the 
mass prodemocracy uprising in burma that began in late july but 
it was not known whether the reported attacks were designed to 
alleviate antigovernment pressure 
also friday the leading opposition group denounced the military 
government for threatening to punish striking workers and said 
burmas leaders were trying to destroy the movement for 
democracy 
the government has ordered all civil servants and workers in 
staterun factories to return to their jobs by monday or face 
dismissal most government employees have been on strike since aug 
8 paralyzing the countrys administrative and economic machinery 
a press release from the national league for democracy said the 
general strike was the major force at the forefront of the 
movement for democracy and urged all people to stay away from 
work 
actions such as removal from service eviction from official 
residence demotion and transfer of government servants for 
continuing the general strike amount to opposing and denial of 
democratic rights the release said 
a spokesperson for the karen ethnic minority rebels said friday 
that nearly 2000 students and others have fled to areas under 
their control along the thai border some of the escapees who hope 
to receive military training at karen bases claim to have seen 
authorities executing students and other protesters 
the karen are among a dozen ethnic groups fighting for greater 
autonomy from the central government the karens who number about 
2 million first rose up against rangoon in the late 1940s 
the new government has promised multiparty general elections but 
the national league for democracy has yet to decide whether to 
contest them 
the league headed by former army general aung gyi has urged 
that people continue to fight the autocratic system through 
peaceful means two other political parties have emerged to oppose 
the government which western diplomats say is squarely behind the 
national unity party 
this militarybacked party under its former name of the burma 
socialist program party has wielded control since strongman ne win 
seized power in a 1962 military coup 
the united nations childrens fund began a sixday airlift of 
103 tons of emergency medical supplies for hospitals in burma a 
chartered c130 aircraft will shuttle between bangkok thailand 
and the burmese capital to deliver the supplies for 50 hospitals 
and 23 dispensaries a unicef release said

president andrei a gromyko retired from the 
ruling politburo today in a major power shift on the first day of a 
hastily called meeting of the policymaking central committee 
gromykos retirement from the politburo will likely set the 
stage for his removal from the presidency which could clear the 
way for mikhail s gorbachev to seek election to a new more 
powerful presidency 
the move was followed by a series of personnel changes that mark 
the largest shakeup in the ruling circle since gorbachev became 
party leader in 1985 
the central committee appeared to demote kremlin no 2 leader 
yegor k ligachev who was assigned responsibility for agricultural 
policy in a reorganized committee apparatus 
ligachev had been responsible for party ideology and had been 
seen as a principal conservative rival to gorbachev he retained 
his politburo job and will be responsible for policy in what 
gorbachev sees as a sector of the economy crucial to reforms but 
he likely will have less influence in the party 
the changes were announced at the meeting which was arranged on 
short notice and required several top officials including foreign 
minister eduarde a shevardnadze to cut short foreign visits and 
rush home 
anatoly f dobrynin the longtime ambassador to washington was 
sent into retirement from his post as communist party foreign 
affairs secretary 
kgb chief viktor m chebrikov was named a secretary of the 
central committee to go along with his politburo status and three 
new alternate members of the politburo were named said vadim a 
medvedev a committee spokesman 
mikhail s solomentsev 75 also was retired from his positions 
as a full member of the politburo and head of the party control 
commission medvedev said 
gromyko and solomentsev were holdovers from previous leaderships 
that have been criticized under gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
or openness 
medvedev himself was elevated to full politburo status he said 
interior minister alexander v vlasov the nations top 
policeman was made an alternate member of the politburo as were 
alexandra biryukova the highestranking woman in the soviet 
hierarchy and anatoly lukyanov general department chief 
the two alternate politburo members who lost their posts were 
vladimir i dolgikh and pyotr n demichev dolgikh was responsible 
for the heavy industry sector of the economy and demichev had 
served as soviet vice president 
the changes left only two politburo members vitaly vorotnikov 
chief of the russian republic and vladimir shcherbitsky head of 
the ukraine as pregorbachev appointees 
there was initial confusion over gromykos status gorbachev in 
his speech to the session said gromyko had requested he be allowed 
to retire on pension indicating he would step down from the 
politburo and the presidency 
but it appeared that gromyko could only ask the party central 
committee to relieve him of his politburo job the question of 
whether he will remain as head of state could be only be taken up 
by the parliament which meets saturday 
medvedev said gromyko had been thinking of retiring for some 
time 
i feel sad over the fact that my position within the communist 
party central committee has changed gromyko told the meeting 
but age is a stubborn thing and there is no getting away from 
it 
gromyko 79 was named president in july 1985 after serving a 
succession of soviet leaders as foreign minister for nearly 30 
years he was replaced as foreign minister by eduard v 
shevardnadze 
tass said earlier that the central committee meeting would 
consider proposals on reorganization of the party apparatus in 
the light of the decisions of the 19th communist party conference 
at that congress in june the soviet leader outlined a series of 
political reforms his blueprint calls for the creation of a 
fulltime standing legislature and a more powerful presidency 
the agriculture section now headed by ligachev is one of six 
departments in a newly reorganized central committee apparatus 
medvedev said the central committee apparatus would be 
drastically reduced perhaps by as much as half 
giorgy razumovsky a close gorbachev protege was assigned 
responsibility for party workers medvedev a political economist 
by training was given responsibility for ideology nikolai 
slyunkov was put in charge of socialeconomic questions alexander 
yakovlev was made chairman of a commission on international policy 
and chebrikov the kgb chief was given responsibility for legal 
policy 
razumovsky and yakovlev are known to be very close advisers to 
gorbachev 
boris k pugo the communist party chief of latvia was chosen 
to replace solomentsev as head of the party control commission 
which reviews reports of misconduct by party officials

republican members of the house intelligence 
committee said today they would ask the full house to vote to 
investigate speaker jim wright on charges that he improperly 
disclosed a secret cia operation in nicaragua 
the lawmakers said they had made that recommendation to house 
minority leader robert michel rill who had accepted it they 
said they were introducing a resolution calling for the wright 
investigation which could be voted on by the full house next week 
rep dick cheney rwyo a member of the intelligence panel and 
the no 3 republican leadership official said the gop had been 
stymied by majority democrats in seeking to start an investigation 
through normal ethics and intelligence committee channels 
absolutely no action has been taken to date and there appears 
little prospect for action by the majority party cheney said at 
a news conference 
joining cheney in introducing the resolution were reps henry 
hyde of illinois bob livingston of louisiana bob mcewen of ohio 
dan lungren of california and bud shuster of pennsylvania 
cheney acknowledged that it would be difficult to pass the 
resolution in the democraticcontrolled house but said he believed 
important institutional principles were at stake including 
cooperation with the executive branch on intelligence matters 
the move promised to heighten partisan tensions over wrights 
problems with just a week left before congress adjourns for the 
campaign trail 
the relationship between the parties is very strained 
cheney said noting that verbal exchanges were reaching new highs 
in bitterness 
cheney said republicans chafing for two years under what they 
consider wrights heavyhanded leadership style had been 
energized by wrights comments last week about a purported cia 
covert operation in nicaragua which they contend violated house 
rules against disclosing secret information 
the pressure over that issue was heightened when the 
intelligence committee on wednesday declined to turn over to the 
ethics committee classified information relevant to a requested 
investigation of wright in the matter 
michel who had requested the probe along with cheney asked gop 
members of the intelligence panel on thursday to prepare a 
confidential report for him recommending what should be done next 
ive never seen this thing get out of control like it is 
now said rep tony coelho the democrats no 3 leadership 
official in the chamber coelho accused gop leaders of trying to 
tear down the institution and of caving in to rightwing 
elements of their party who seek to embarrass wright 
coelho dcalif said the intelligence meeting was forced by 
republicans who knew the panel would have to decline to release 
the information 
what you have now is an effort thats very political very 
aggressive and loaded with grenades he said attributing the 
whole controversy to republican frustration over being the minority 
party in the house since 1956 
the republicans problem in the house is that we dont take 
them seriously republicans in the senate dont take them seriously 
and the white house doesnt take them seriously coelho added 
i wonder what tonys smoking cheney said when apprised of 
the comments the real problem is the speaker and the way he 
operates hes trashed the cia damaged us foreign policy in 
nicaragua all of tony coelhos blue smoke and mirrors wont 
change that 
wright dtexas said the effort to launch a probe into his 
comments was a political move and again denied revealing classified 
secrets when he spoke to reporters about what he termed the cias 
attempts to instigate civil unrest in nicaragua 
it is really very sad that people will try to use the ethics 
committee or any other committee of the house as a cats paw to 
try to carry out a partisan political vendetta against another 
member he said 
but republicans called the democratic counteroffensive a dodge 
and said wright simply was seeking to escape the consequences of 
his mistake by stirring up a partisan smoke screen 
and members in both parties saw michels participation in the 
request for an investigation as a turning point in relations 
between the parties in the chamber because michel has for years 
taken a less confrontational stance in dealings with the majority 
some moderate democrats were saying privately that while they 
were proud of the legislative record of the 100th congress under 
wrights leadership they were uncomfortable with his highly 
visible role in us diplomacy toward central america 
tensions between the two sides surfaced on the house floor 
thursday after one democratic lawmaker rep pat williams of 
montana denounced gop vice presidential nominee dan quayle for 
hypocrisy in campaign statements that didnt match his voting 
record republican members bristled and demanded that williams be 
ruled out of order 
i think its probably set the stage for a series of 
fireworks williams said later the members are at a boiling 
point not only because of the presidential campaign but also 
because of the charges against the speaker

teenagers with overactive imaginations 
are to blame for rumors that a satanic cult is searching for a 
blond blueeyed child for human sacrifice a police official said 
friday 
as the rumors flowed more than three dozen children were kept 
from the elementary school in sissonville a town of 400 people 20 
miles to the northwest 
yesterday we had 52 students out wallace heights elementary 
school principal freddie keen said friday today were down to 
43 and six of them their parents called to say they are sick 
the rumors have spread into adjacent putnam county where the 
sheriffs department reported receiving 50 calls thursday from 
worried parents one school secretary said she had received 
numerous calls from parents who wanted to make sure teachers are 
present when students are on the playground or boarding buses 
police say theyve found no evidence to support the stories but 
some parents say theyve heard rumors a satanic cult has been 
mutilating dogs and searching for a blond blueeyed child 
ive heard them the parents have heard them keen said 
kanawha county sheriffs department capt wt markham said 
local children are to blame for the rumors 
we think a bunch of kids 13 and 14 years old got hold of a 
bunch of books about satan worship and cults and theyre reading 
these things and starting rumors and theyre getting a lot of 
mileage out of these rumors markham said 
markham said officers have found no evidence of a cult but that 
doesnt satisfy some parents 
i told that to one parent and she said yes but you dont 
have a blondhaired blueeyed child do you markham said 
kanawha county schools superintendent richard trumble said 
security at school has been beefed up but keen said some parents 
still are afraid 
theres no physical evidence keen said theres a lot of 
fear theres a lot of fear in the whole county the rumors have 
been going on for weeks

a federal appeals court on friday rebuffed an 
attempt by oliver l north and two codefendants to stop their 
prosecution for diverting the proceeds of usiran arms sales to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals said it 
would only consider arguments that the defendants congressional 
testimony was illegally used against them after convictions in the 
case 
except for a very limited number of cases appeals in 
criminal cases must await the termination of the proceedings by 
final judgment said circuit judges james l buckley douglas h 
ginsburg and david sentelle 
if appellants claims may effectively be reviewed on appeal 
from a final judgment of conviction there is no justification for 
departing from the general prohibition against piecemeal review 
the court said of the defense challenge that was joined by the 
american civil liberties union 
north a former national security council aide former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim 
contended that because of widespread publicity grand jurors and 
witnesses were exposed to the congressional testimony the 
defendants gave under limited immunity from prosecution 
prosecutors are barred from using the immunized testimony that a 
witnesses gives congress as evidence against that defendant in 
court 
while the court did not rule on the merits of the appeal the 
judges said the defendants claim that the congressional 
immunity affords them a right not to be prosecuted at all is 
illfounded 
the three defendants had appealed us district judge gerhard a 
gesells preliminary determination that prosecutors and grand 
jurors had not relied on the immunized congressional testimony as 
evidence to return the indictment 
gesells decision to hold only a limited pretrial hearing on 
the issue of grand jury taint was also a subject to the 
challenge 
the appeals court also dismissed a request that it order gesell 
to either dismiss the indictment or hold a more extensive pretrial 
hearing on the immunity issue 
gesell had ruled that the question could be dealt with in 
posttrial proceedings if any evidence of taint emerged during the 
trials 
the judge has ordered separate trials for north poindexter 
hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v secord a business 
partner of hakim who testified on capitol hill without limited 
immunity 
the defendants are accused of conspiring to defraud the us 
government by diverting proceeds from the armsforhostages deals 
with iran to the contras at a time when congress banned american 
military aid to the rebels 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh has elected to try north 
first but the case is not expected to go to trial until next year 
gesell has indefinitely postponed the case to give prosecutors 
additional time to find and process a large number of classified 
documents that north may be entitled to use in his defense 
in a statement issued following fridays decision walsh said 
the court of appeals decision is most welcome and permits us to 
concentrate on pursuing the cases awaiting trial 
at a pretrial hearing last spring walsh documented elaborate 
procedures to prevent members of his staff and grand jurors from 
being exposed to the immunized congressional testimony of the 
defendants 
walsh also filed evidence under seal in court to prove it was 
not derived from information obtained by the house and senate 
irancontra investigating committees 
the appeals panel also rejected the defense contention that the 
right not to be tried on tainted evidence must be invoked 
before trial or it otherwise would not exist 
the defendants have failed to demonstrate how the remedy 
afforded by direct appeal will be clearly inadequate to correct 
the perceived wrong it said 
even when vindication of the defendants rights requires 
dismissal of the charge altogether however an interlocutory 
appeal is not automatically justified the court said of the 
defense attempt to mount its legal challenge before the cases are 
tried 
the immunity issue also hinges on whether witnesses who 
testified before the grand jury gave evidence in that proceeding 
that was influenced what they learned from what north poindexter 
or hakim told congress

lloyd bentsen today dismissed republican 
george bushs stated commitments to education and a balanced 
federal budget and also got in a jibe at bushs running mate 
george bush likes to talk about balanced budgets bentsen 
said its like dan quayle talking about his resume theres not 
much to say 
bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee said that 
michael dukakis his partys standardbearer has balanced 10 
consecutive massachusetts budgets 
thats the difference between promise and performance and 
thats a difference we understand in the south said bentsen a 
senator from texas 
he also told the crowd of about 500 people that he and dukakis 
are committed to a strong national defense 
the night before in dallas bentsen told fellow texans that 
dukakis is more in tune with their concerns than bush and declared 
himself eager to debate his radical right counterpart on the 
republican ticket 
at the fundraiser bentsen joked about bushs claim to be a 
texan the vice presidents legal residence is a houston hotel 
suite 
i saw you check into the hotel and register bentsent told 
dukakis in the minds of some that makes you a texan 
jokes aside bentsen used strong partisan rhetoric in describing 
the stakes of the november election in texas and across the country 
and of his debate next week with gop vice presidential nominee 
quayle who had campaigned in texas the previous day 
i dont have to tell you that the refusal of the reaganbush 
administration to develop themselves a national energy policy has 
sentenced much of this state to a very deep and powerful 
recession the texas senator told the 12 million fundraiser 
as for quayle bentsen who has spent much of this campaign trip 
preparing for the debate said he was looking forward to 
discussing the issues with dan quayle because i think his radical 
right agenda is out of the mainstream of america and i think 
americans think that 
he doesnt even know what century he lives in bentsen said 
in a poke at a recent gaffe by quayle who said he had not lived in 
this century and believe me if they get their way well be 
living in the 19th century and not the 20th century 
dukakis in his remarks encouraged bentsen to confront quayle 
on the issues and called the indiana senator whatshisname 
bentsen attacked bush and other republicans for questioning the 
patriotism of dukakis whom he introduced as a patriot from 
massachusetts saying that the pledge of allegiance belongs to 
all americans and that the democratic ticket had an extra pledge of 
its own 
we wont allow america to be kicked around by countries more 
than happy to play us for the loser bentsen said we wont let 
this nation wonder what on earth is going on behind closed doors in 
washington no crazy deals cooked up in the white house 
basement no falling asleep at the switch while secondlevel aides 
run that show 
that comment appeared to be a direct attack of president reagan 
something both dukakis and bentsen have for the most part avoided 
throughout the campaign 
earlier joining dukakis to accept the endorsement of texas 
largest police organization bentsen portrayed dukakis as a proven 
crimefighter who has cut crime and drug use in his state and a 
leader who would provide action instead of republican words and 
rhetoric 
he also hailed the successful launch of the space shuttle 
discovery as a sign that the united states was ready to reclaim its 
leadership in space and technology 
watch out russia were going to take that leadership 
away he said bentsen watched the launch on television in 
tennessee before flying to texas on thursday morning

president reagan said today there is no truth to 
a report published in israel that the united states has negotiated 
successfully with iran to gain the freedom of eight americans and 
one briton held hostage in lebanon 
we are not negotiating directly with iran we have not talked 
to the kidnappers reagan said shortly after arriving here on a 
political trip 
i think maybe iran is putting these stories out he added 
the report in the monthold israeli weekly the nation said 
that in exchange for the releases beginning in about a week 
washington will provide economic aid gradually release billions of 
dollars in iranian funds frozen in us banks and resume diplomatic 
relations with tehran 
the newspaper quoting unnamed sources said the united states 
and iran had been negotiating directly on the matter since monday 
in geneva the hostages are believed to be held by proiranian 
shiite moslems 
flying here from washington presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters on air force one 
there have been no facetoface negotiations there have 
always been thirdparty contacts but there have been no talks that 
we directed or we participated in 
the problem is i cannot account for other people who may have 
been talking to iran but in the sense of the word that we 
asked somebody to talk for the united states the answer is no 
the spokesman said that there is no one authorized to make a 
deal for hostages or do anything that is contrary to our policy 
were always ready to talk at authorized levels we make no 
deals

president gen augusto pinochet seeking 
voter ratification of a new eightyear term asked chileans to 
forgive him if ive done something wrong since he seized power 
in 1973 
in an interview televised nationwide on all channels pinochet 
on thursday night urged voters to think of chile when they go 
to the polls oct 5 to vote in a referendum on his presidency 
at the conclusion of the 15minute appearance he said if ive 
done something wrong forgive me but i think that overall i have 
more in my favor than against me 
the 72yearold army commander rarely admits to wrong actions 
and is more prone to laud the accomplishments of his rightwing 
authoritarian government in public speeches and appearances 
but most opinion polls show him lagging behind the opposition in 
voter support and the admission appeared an attempt to win the 
backing of moderate voters offended by his harsh rule his 
government repeatedly has been criticized by local and 
international organizations for human rights abuse and restricting 
civil liberties 
in the referendum chileans will vote yes or no on a proposal by 
the countrys military commanders that pinochet remain president 
until 1997 
if most vote yes he will assume a new eightyear term in march 
if the majority vote no an open election will be called next year 
and pinochet will hand over power to the winner in march 1990 
the interview appeared during 15 minutes of free television time 
that progovernment forces receive nightly a coalition of 16 
opposition parties ranging from the centerright to socialist 
also receives 15 minutes nightly 
on sept 11 1973 pinochet toppled elected president salvador 
allende a marxist allende died in the coup

the governments chief forecasting gauge of 
future economic activity rose a moderate 04 percent in august 
suggesting to analysts that growth will continue through next year 
but at a slower pace 
the gain reported friday in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators follows a 06 percent drop in july and 
a 15 percent jump in june 
i think the index is telling us that we ought to get 
through 1989 without a recession said cynthia latta an 
economist with data resources inc in lexington mass i think it 
also tells us if you look at the last few months together that 
the economy will be growing more slowly by next year 
the index is intended to predict economic activity six to nine 
months in advance but analysts caution against drawing firm 
conclusions until a clear pattern is established over three months 
in another report the commerce department said new 
singlefamily homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
713000 units in august up 01 percent from july and the same as 
in june 
it was the best threemonth performance since februaryapril 
1987 when longterm mortgage rates dipped below 9 percent and 
spurred a housing sales boom 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said fridays reports 
were good news for the economy and suggest continued economic 
growth 
most economists agree that growth as measured by the gross 
national product will slow from the robust 32 percent annual pace 
of the first half of this year 
they differ however over how much and how soon the federal 
reserve board which has been pushing up interest rates since late 
march in an effort to curb inflationary pressures believes a 2 
percent to 25 percent growth rate is sustainable without inflation 
an increase in unemployment in august coupled with lackluster 
retail sales and sluggish growth in personal income all pointed to 
a welcome cooling however a big increase in orders of 
manufactured goods and now the leading index indicate that august 
may represent at best a pause in growth 
i think this concern that seemed to be developing from a lot 
of the early august data that the expansion was running out of gas 
was somewhat premature said robert g dederick chief economist 
for northern trust co in chicago 
it was only a moderate increase but weve reached a point 
that if the indicators are very strong wed be sitting here 
chewing our nails worrying about inflation the fact that 
these indicators are not moving up strongly is probably 
favorable he said 
dederick said the economy likely has not slowed enough to 
satisfy the fed which he said probably would nudge interest rates 
higher late this year or early next year 
five of the available nine components of the leading index 
contributed to the increase in august while four detracted from it 
the biggest boosts came from a drop in average weekly claims for 
state unemployment benefits from 325000 in july to 298000 a 
rise in orders for manufactured consumer goods from 852 billion 
to 893 billion last month also was a big plus 
together these two categories accounted for twothirds of the 
positive activity also adding to the overall increase were rises 
in plant and equipment orders in building permits and in the price 
of raw materials which is read as a sign of strong demand 
indicators making a negative contribution in order of severity 
were a decrease in business delivery times read as an indication 
of slackening demand a drop in the average workweek a decline in 
the standard amp poors index of 500 stocks and a contraction of the 
money supply in inflationadjusted dollars 
the 04 percent overall increase left the index at 1934 percent 
of its 1967 base of 100 
the leading index since its creation in 1948 has correctly 
predicted all eight recessions however it also has falsely 
predicted a recession four times 
the index last declined for three consecutive months from june 
through august 1984 the economic expansion slowed but there was 
no contraction 
also preliminary estimates of the index are often revised 
substantially in later months for instance declines were 
initially reported for five straight months from september 1987 
through last january later revisions wiped out all but two of the 
drops in november and january

christian and druse forces agreed to a 
ceasefire friday after a fivehour skirmish and rival moslem and 
christian cabinets sought to defuse tensions in separate meetings 
police said six people were wounded when prosyrian militiamen 
of the druse a mystical offshoot of islam and soldiers loyal to 
christian army commander gen michel aoun battled with mortars and 
machine guns 
it was not known which side provoked the clash in the mountain 
resort of souk elgharb seven miles southeast of the lebanese 
capital police said 
the ceasefire was arranged by a security committee that 
included representatives of the army and the principal militias 
said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
an informal ceasefire halted fighting in the christianmoslem 
civil war in 1986 but the threat of formal partition rose last 
week after separate cabinets claimed power last week 
aoun a maronite catholic heads the christian cabinet he was 
appointed prime minister by president amin gemayel on sept 22 
minutes before gemayels sixyear term ended 
moslems rejected the appointment insisting the legal cabinet is 
that of salim hoss acting prime minister under gemayel hoss is a 
sunni moslem 
under an unwritten covenant that dates to lebanons independence 
from france in 1943 the president must be a maronite the prime 
minister a sunni and parliament speaker a shiite moslem 
on friday the moslem cabinet decided to promote army and police 
officers a move that was adopted by aouns christian cabinet in 
its first meeting tuesday 
aouns threeman cabinet also met friday it decided to ensure 
supplies of bread flour fuel and butane in east and west 
beirut as well as throughout lebanon aoun told reporters after 
the meeting 
hoss cabinet also adopted a similar decision 
aouns cabinet reminded government employees and other civil 
servants to follow only the instructions issued by the 
constitutional cabinet which was appointed by former president 
amin gemayel sept 22 minutes before he ended his sixyear term 
the two cabinets said their decisions on promoting army and 
police officers must be referred to lebanons 76man parliament for 
ratification 
the dual cabinets have separately noted that their main goal is 
to speed up the election of a president to rule the wartorn nation 
by sept 23 parliament had failed three times in five weeks to 
convene and elect a successor to gemayel house speaker hussein 
husseini a shiite moslem has indefinitely postponed the election 
session 
a boycott by christian parliament members prevented it from 
attaining the 51member quorum needed to vote for a new president 
the boycott reflected opposition to the candidacy of 
syrianbacked suleiman franjieh and mikhail daher the christians 
charged franjieh and daher would change lebanon into a syrian 
satellite 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon it has 40000 troops 
in eastern and northern provinces as well as in west and south

sales of new singlefamily homes bolstered by 
a surge in the midwest rose slightly in august to continue the 
strongest sales pace since early 1987 the government said friday 
the commerce department said sales inched up 01 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713000 units last month 1000 
more sales than in july and the same as in june 
it was the strongest threemonth pace since februaryapril 1987 
when sales were booming because fixedrate mortgages had fallen to 
a low for the decade of between 85 percent and 9 percent 
the strength this summer has surprised many analysts who 
expected sales to taper off as the federal reserve board nudged up 
interest rates to fight inflation 
fixedrate mortgages dipped below 10 percent in february and 
march climbed to nearly 1075 percent in august and have since 
eased back to about 105 percent 
the federal home loan mortgage corp said fixedrate mortgages 
not including addon fees known as points averaged 1042 percent 
this week up from 1040 percent last week 
i think theres a sort of beattheclock behavior going on 
among consumers said richard w peach deputy chief economist of 
the mortgage bankers association of america people were trying 
to get into the market before rates get too far out of line 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of 
home builders said builders in surveys report brisk sales in early 
september he said the fundamental strength of the economy and the 
availability of lowerpriced adjustablerate mortgages have helped 
prop up sales 
however he predicted the fed will again push interest rates 
higher after the election and newhome sales will fall 
by region sales rose 109 percent in the midwest to an annual 
sales pace of 102000 units they were up 19 percent in the 
northeast to 107000 units and up 03 percent to 287000 units in 
the south 
a 52 percent drop in the west to 217000 units almost offset 
the gains in other regions 
john a tuccillo chief economist of the national association of 
realtors said sales are recovering in the midwest with the 
exportdriven resurgence of manufacturing firms there while sales 
have been hurt in the west and northeast by high prices 
the median price of new homes fell 67 percent in august to 
112000 meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less 
that followed an identical decline in july however the average 
home price rose 20 percent to 145200 in august following a 42 
percent rise in july 
the combination of a drop in the median price and rise in the 
average price likely means more new homes of very high prices are 
being sold skewing the average 
contractors squeezed by high land prices are apparently 
attempting to sell to affluent purchasers looking to trade up 
rather than to firsttime home buyers 
for the first eight months of 1988 newhome sales were 14 
percent lower than the same period a year earlier less of a 
dropoff than was anticipated at the beginning of the year 
peach said he now expects newhome sales to total 675000 this 
year up slightly from 671000 last year but well below the peak of 
750000 units hit in 1986

sam ketcham seems more puzzled than hurt 
when he talks about his abrupt ouster from the upscale atlanta 
shopping mall where he had performed his organ grinder act with a 
monkey for three decades 
ketcham known around atlanta as the monkey man can be found 
these days in short stints such as the north georgia state fair 
he was doing a brisk business thursday night while his 
39yearold monkey willie dressed in a flowered suit and cowboy 
hat collected mostly nickels and pennies from children at the fair 
at lenox square the mall where he worked since 1959 he said he 
and his son also an organ grinder could pull in a couple hundred 
dollars in a good week 
but he was told this summer he no longer fits the image of lenox 
square and could not perform there after july 19 
all of a sudden i got a letter saying i cant come back he 
said 
ketcham 72 is among a vanishing breed doing an act associated 
with simpler times in a city that strains to be a model for the 
future 
everybody gets a kick out of it ketcham said nodding at 
the kids see how they go they go crazy over the monkey 
when willie needed a rest ketcham locked the animal in a 
compartment in the back of his cart and mused about how hiing card you 
know he said 
and besides he added i spent a lot of money there over the

even while discovery is in orbit 
workers at the kennedy space center are readying the next space 
shuttle for launch in midnovember 
within hours of liftoff thursday morning nasa workers were 
inspecting the launchpad and continuing with preparations to put 
the shuttle atlantis into orbit to deploy a secret military payload 
were ready to do another one said nasa spokeswoman lisa 
malone 
atlantis is scheduled to be launched no earlier than nov 17 
since it is a defense department mission information about the 
payload and work that will be performed during the flight is 
classified she said 
unlike the discovery flight which has been bathed in attention 
as the mission that returned america to space after a 2year 
drought the atlantis flight will be very lowkey she said 
nasa wont even make the countdown public until nine minutes 
before launch nasa makes a brief announcement when the spacecraft 
reaches orbit and every 24 hours nasa reconfirms that the flight 
is continuing and the astronauts are healthy twelve hours notice 
is given for landing 
discovery is scheduled to land monday morning at edwards air 
force base in california about 300 kennedy space center engineers 
and technicians will be there to prepare the spacecraft for its 
flight back to florida 
well be out there about a week and while were there were 
going to be slower here at kennedy when we get them all back here 
our priority will be atlantis malone said 
about four miles from the pad atlantis is being prepared for 
attachment to its external fuel tank the huge orange cylinder that 
feeds the shuttles engines as it rides into space 
the two booster rockers which will power the shuttle off the 
pad and through the first part of its trip into orbit have already 
been attached to the sides of the fuel tank 
the shuttle could be ready to be transported to the pad oct 21 
malone said 
atlantis will be perched on the same spot where discovery stood 
and a damage assessment team reported little damage to the pad and 
support structure from the force and heat of its sister ships 
takeoff 
the condition of the pad is excellent said larry schultz 
nasas chief of launch structures theres some normal fixup 
painting kind of thing thats got to be done 
schultz said no design changes are necessary to the pad which 
has been used for only one other shuttle launch the tragic 
challenger flight that ended 73 seconds after liftoff in an 
explosion 
weve gotten pretty good at limiting damage to the launchpad 
and maximizing its reuse he said we have 25 launches under out 
belt 
there were no surprises on this one he said 
after atlantis discovery is set for another mission in january 
the first of seven scheduled of 1989

mikhail s gorbachev retired president andrei a 
gromyko from the politburo and fired other top leaders friday in a 
quickpaced kremlin shakeup that brought gorbachev closer to 
assuming a new more powerful presidency 
an extraordinary meeting of the communist party central 
committee made the biggest changes in the soviet hierarchy since 
gorbachev became party general secretary in 1985 top party ranks 
were virtually stripped of appointees made by his predecessors 
kremlin no 2 yegor k ligachev named party chief for 
agriculture in a streamlined committee apparatus apparently was 
demoted in the meeting which lasted only one hour 
ligachev a member of the 12man ruling politburo who earlier 
was replaced as party chief for ideology was widely seen as a 
potential conservative rival to gorbachev 
the partys top job in agriculture once held by gorbachev 
himself is key under the communist party chiefs ambitious plan 
for economic reform but it carries far less prestige than the 
portfolio for ideology the post customarily held by the partys 
no 2 
the 300member policymaking central committee also named vadim 
a medvedev a full politburo member and gave him responsibility for 
ideology 
medvedev told reporters afterward that mikhail s solomentsev 
75 also was retired from the politburo 
the retirement of the 79yearold gromyko from the politburo set 
the stage for his removal as president during a special session of 
the supreme soviet legislature scheduled for saturday in the 
kremlin 
he is still the president for today foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady i gerasimov told reporters at the united nations 
in new york but tomorrow the supreme soviet will be convened to 
decide on the presidency gerasimov added 
gromykos retirement would clear the way for gorbachev to seek 
election himself to a new more powerful presidency that he has 
advocated the more powerful post would include responsibility for 
defense foreign affairs and formation of the government 
this weeks central committee meeting and the parliament session 
were called in haste indicating gorbachev may have decided to act 
before opposition to the personnel changes could gel the meetings 
brought officials like foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and 
defense minister dmitri t yazov scurrying back to moscow from 
trips abroad 
at the meeting gorbachev lauded the merits and achievements 
of the dourfaced gromyko indicating he was leaving in good 
standing gromyko served as soviet foreign minister for 27 years 
before becoming president in july 1985 
i feel sad over the fact that my position within the communist 
party central committee has changed gromyko told the meeting 
but age is a stubborn thing and there is no getting away from 
it 
gorbachev said generally speaking it has been a rich 
political life today when andrei gromyko is retiring i would like 
to thank him on behalf of my colleagues in the political bureau 
and i hope the participants in the plenum think the same for the 
good work and faithful service for the party and the state and to 
wish him good health 
the remarks by gorbachev and gromyko were reported by the 
official tass news agency 
two alternate members of the politburo also lost their posts 
vladimir i dolgikh and pyotr n demichev 
dolgikh 63 and retiring politburo member solomentsev were 
considered experts in heavy industry and their retirement may 
indicate dissatisfaction with efforts to increase efficiency in 
that key area of the economy 
demichev 70 has served as soviet vice president but he could 
lose that job at saturdays supreme soviet session 
removal of those officials left only two pregorbachev

west germany appointed an ambassador 
to libya for the first time since the 1986 bombing of a berlin 
disco that us officials blamed on the north african nation a 
foreign ministry spokesman said friday 
we see in libya positive changes politically and economically 
and in terms of foreign policy said the spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
he cited as one example libyan leader col moammar gadhafis 
decision to release prisoners from the fighting with neighboring 
chad as well as unspecified internal reforms 
the april 5 1986 attack on west berlins popular la belle 
disco killed two us military personnel and a turkish woman and 
injured about 230 other people 
citing what it said was proof of libyan involvement in the la 
belle attack the united states bombed the libyan cities of tripoli 
and benghazi 10 days later in retaliation 
that may the last west german ambassador left tripoli the end 
of his threeyear tour and was not replaced due to the controversy 
over the la belle bombing the spokesman said 
but since then west berlin authorities have said they have no 
concrete indications that libya was involved some west berlin 
officials have said they suspect syria may have been behind the 
disco attack 
the foreign ministry spokesman said juergen hellner who speaks 
fluent arabic will be sent to libya next month as the new 
ambassador a standard west german biographical reference book 
wer ist wer said that hellner served as the deputy chief of 
west germanys diplomatic mission in syria in the early 1970s 
the spokesman said there was no connection between the 
appointment and the still inconclusive berlin probe 
we simply decided that we would have a better diplomatic 
presence by being represented by an ambassador the spokesman 
said 
asked specifically whether bonn officials believe gadhafi has 
backed off from a worldwide terrorism campaign the spokesman said 
if you take gadhafi at his word there has been a change we hope 
that has changed for the better but we will have to wait and see 
but the top us counterterrorism official said in washington 
this week that libya is supporting a renewed terrorist campaign led 
by palestineborn abu nidal 
ambassadoratlarge l paul bremer also told reporters that 
libya is using surrogates such as the japanese red army in the 
terror campaign the united states has no diplomatic ties to libya 
west germany will rejoin west european nations such as spain 
france denmark greece and italy that have ambassadors to libya 
italy is libyas largest trading partner 
libya is west germanys no 2 oil supplier behind britain 
britain broke diplomatic relations with gadhafis government in 
1984 after a london policewoman was shot to death during a protest 
against the radical leader outside the libyan embassy in london 
since the departure of the previous ambassador west germany has 
been represented in libya by a charge daffaires

an israeli newspaper reported friday that the 
united states has struck a secret deal with iran promising aid and 
arms sales in exchange for the release of nine us and british 
hostages 
president reagan denied the report by the nation a 1monthold 
englishlanguage weekly 
we are not negotiating directly with iran we have not talked 
to the kidnappers i think maybe iran is putting these stories 
out reagan said in chicago 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on the presidential 
plane en route to chicago left open the possibility that a third 
party was holding talks with iran in an effort to release the 
hostages 
the report which quoted unidentified sources in geneva said 
five american hostages held by lebanese shiites would be released 
with irans help about oct 7 a second group of hostages 
including three americans and a briton possibly anglican clergyman 
terry waite would be released a week later the paper said 
it said that in return the united states promised economic aid 
renewal of arms sales the release of billions of dollars of frozen 
iranian assets in us banks and resumption of diplomatic relations 
but the report said arms sales would be renewed only after the 
hostages were released to avoid creating the impression of an 
arms for hostages deal 
fitzwater told reporters i dont deny that there are people 
talking to iran about the hostages but no us officials are 
talking to them there is no one authorized to make a deal for 
hostages or do anything that is contrary to our policy 
hesh kestin the managing editor of the nation stood by the 
story 
i dont think a story is true or false because washington 
denies it kestin said washington has denied many stories and 
lo and behold it eventually turns out that theyre true 
many news stories in the middle east and elsewhere have said 
that a hostage release is imminent but the stories have not proved 
accurate 
seventeen foreign hostages are believed held in lebanon 
including nine americans terry anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press is the longest held hostage 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the newspaper report said the us put aside its demand that 
teheran release marine lt col william higgins one of the nine 
americans because officials were convinced iran does not control 
the kidnappers holding him 
the iranians said they knew only that higgins was spirited away 
on a fishing boat off the lebanese port of tyre and transferred to 
a larger ship at sea the newspaper said 
the nation said the united states turned down the proiranian 
islamic jihad groups demand for 3 million in ransom for the 
hostages 
the paper also said iranian commanderinchief hashemi 
rafsanjani escaped an assassination attempt last week as he was 
being driven back from the parliament in tehran four of his 
bodyguards were killed in the ambush the paper said 
the report could not be confirmed

a patch of the mojave 
desert will be open for anyone who wants to watch discovery land 
monday but spectators will have to endure traffic jams chemical 
toilets and maybe even rattlesnakes 
nasa expects 100000 to 200000 visitors at the viewing site on 
the hard clay east shore of rogers dry lake where the space 
shuttle is scheduled to touch down at 933 am pdt said nancy 
lovato a spokeswoman for the space agency 
the record crowd for a landing was the estimated 500000 people 
who joined president reagan in witnessing the july 4 1982 landing 
of columbia on a paved runway at this military base 80 miles 
northeast of los angeles 
this time george bush will attend in his capacity as vice 
president not as the republican presidential candidate his aides 
emphatically told national aeronautics and space administration 
spokesman ralph jackson 
the viewing site opens 24 hours before the landing jackson 
predicted heavy traffic along the desert highways and remember 
all the air police fellows out there got radar 
lovato said the worst traffic jams will occur before dawn haley 
said all gates to edwards air force base will be closed to the 
general public and access to the east shore viewing site which 
doesnt require a vehicle pass or entry through any of the gates 
will be halted one hour before the landing 
no gasoline is available at the viewing site a nasa fact 
sheet advised no shelter from the sun will be available no 
telephones will be available no plumbing or electricity will be 
available no dumping facilities for rv toilets will be available 
however dozens of portable chemical toilets already have been 
placed on the lakeshore viewing site very little water or food 
will be available so spectators are advised to bring their own 
the fact sheet also warned rattlesnakes are present and must 
be respected 
people can camp out there and if they have a recreational 
vehicle theyd be well advised to do that lovato said 
bush will watch the landing from the roof of nasas building 
here or from a ramp by nasas hangar which lovato said also has 
been invaded by rattlers at times 
as for the general public somebody who wanders out of where 
theyre supposed to be into the hills behind the viewing site could 
encounter some rattlesnakes haley said 
but he said hes not aware of any snakebite victims among 
spectators at past shuttle landings 
usually with all the people and vehicles theres so much 
noise the snakes stay away lovato said

andrei a gromyko whose unsmiling countenance and 
tough talk personified the soviet union for nearly three decades 
is making a graceful exit by soviet standards 
the 79yearold president who represented his government as 
foreign minister through most of the poststalin era was retired 
friday from his post on the ruling communist party politburo 
ostensibly at his own request he is expected to surrender the 
largely ceremonial presidency at a saturday meeting of the supreme 
soviet or parliament 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev praised the outgoing 
president for his great work and faithful service to the 
communist party and the soviet nation indicating gromyko is 
leaving in good standing 
as a further indication he remained in good stead gromykos 
comment that he was sad to be leaving but that age is a stubborn 
thing was read on the national evening news along with 
gorbachevs praise 
nicknamed old stoneface by the western diplomats who faced 
him through years of negotiations and eastwest tensions gromyko 
remained a symbol of continuity after gorbachev moved him aside 
three years ago to install eduard a shevardnadze a newcomer to 
foreign policy as the head of the foreign ministry 
since then he has appeared at official functions greeted 
foreign visitors and performed various ceremonial tasks 
in his longtime role as foreign policy chief he was respected 
by those who faced him across the bargaining table for his ability 
to precisely enunciate soviet policy and his voluminous knowledge 
of historical detail 
he always stuck to the official line and was known as a stubborn 
negotiator who would rather walk away from negoatiations than 
compromise on an issue critical to his government 
after joining the foreign ministry and being posted to 
washington at the outbreak of world war ii gromyko became 
ambassador to the united states in 1946 he was named his 
countrys first permanent un representative 
during the world bodys formative years he earned the nickname 
mr nyet for the 26 vetoes he cast in the security council and 
his frequent walkouts 
nikita khrushchev who elevated him to foreign minister told 
the united nations that gromyko was so loyal he would drop his 
pants and sit on a block of ice if khrushchev told him to gromyko 
sat impassively as his leader spoke as he did again several years 
later when khrushchev startled the general assembly by removing his 
shoe and banging it on his desk 
gromyko was a player in every superpower confrontation for more 
than a quartercentury but rarely shared his private insights his 
memoirs published after he left the foreign ministry were most 
notable for their lack of spicy detail 
although he was generally regarded as a party hardliner gromyko 
reportedly played a pivotal role in the selection of the reformer 
gorbachev to take over the soviet leadership in march 1985 
although gorbachev removed him from the foreign ministers post 
he had held for 26 years the party chief kept him on in a visible 
role as chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet the 
equivalent of the presidency 
gromykos advancing age made his replacement inevitable but 
gorbachev practically set a timetable for his retirement at the 
partys national conference in june when he proposed a new 
governmental structure with a strong president elected by an 
expanded congress of peoples deputies 
gorbachev is expected to seek that post probably in the spring

president reagan recalling his early days as a 
radio announcer visited wrigley field on friday calling the 
playbyplay for a television broadcast of a chicago cubs baseball 
game 
reagan who had been scheduled to speak to a group of ethnic 
leaders and attend a gop fundraiser during fridays visit made an 
unscheduled stop at the venerable ballpark for a national league 
game between the cubs and pittsburgh pirates 
in his early days as a radio broadcaster in davenport and des 
moines iowa reagan used to recreate cubs games on the air using 
wireservice playbyplay 
you know in a few months im going to be out of work and i 
thought i might as well audition reagan said after he was 
introduced by cubs announcer harry caray 
reagan called part of the first inning and the top half of the 
second 
heres how he called the scoring play when the cubs took a 10 
lead in the bottom of the first 
and there are still men on first and third and there goes a 
ball over second base and its a hit out into center field 
one run in men on first and third 
reagan chatted with caray and fellow announcer steve stone 
telling them his present job is more difficult than making up cubs 
playbyplay 50 years ago 
since i did the cubs games by telegraphic report i dont 
think it was as hard as the present job because by the time i got 
the slip of paper it had already happened he said 
before entering the broadcast booth reagan donned a red white 
and blue cubs warmup jacket and threw out the ceremonial first 
pitch 
from his vantage point caray called it high and inside

discoverys solid fuel boosters 
looking absolutely perfect except for slight discoloration 
were pulled ashore friday for scrutiny by anxious experts who 
revamped the rockets after the challenger disaster 
as curious grayandwhite seagulls squawked and glided overhead 
two recovery ships brought the empty casings into port canaverals 
choppy waters dozens of cameraarmed tourists and some nasa 
officials looked on 
other than some blackening at their bottoms and discoloration 
attributed to the flames of liftoff the 149footlong 
200000pound reusable boosters showed no outward signs of problems 
it looked absolutely perfect said john thomas who headed 
oversight of the booster redesign for the marshall space flight 
center in huntsville ala the nasa center responsible for shuttle 
propulsion 
adoubleplus was the estimate from rocky raab spokesman 
for morton thiokol inc of brigham city utah which build the 
boosters 
rabb said divers who got the first look said they seemed in 
perfect condition adding that they would see evidence if the 
joints were leaking there was none of that 
he said morton thiokols contract specifications called for a 
plusorminus 3 percent range in the pressure pounds per square 
inch used by the boosters in blastoff and the data returned 
thursday showed a deviation of only 09 percent 
divers waiting with special attachment devices in recovery ships 
150 miles east of the kennedy space center got to the boosters 
quickly after they dropped off the shuttle two minutes four 
seconds after liftoff their 81feetpersecond descent slowed by 
parachutes thursday both were at port canaveral before noon 
several hours earlier than expected 
as soon as the first booster was brought to port by the recovery 
ship freedom star an orangesuited safety inspector went out to 
meet it in a lifeboat and crawled inside to begin taking a close 
look and to check for leaks of volatile hydrazine 
the boosters were then headed to a hangar at the cape canaveral 
air force station where technicians will use highpowered water 
sprays to ensure safety and to clean them within two weeks they 
will taken apart under the watchful eyes of nasa officials and 
technical experts of morton thiokol 
within two months they should be back at the utah plant for 
further examination and barr notoriety after the challenger 
disaster in which the boosters were blamed for causing the 
explosion piqued interest along with television images thursday 
of flames spewing up the boosters sides 
its pretty impressive im pretty well informed on these ich and 
people 
remember what happened to challenger people looked at that and 
they forgot that its normal said raab 
it was a failed joint that led to the jan 28 1986 challenger 
destruction killing seven astronauts a presidential commission 
that investigated the accident found that rubberized orings did 
not seal allowing flame to escape 
to return the grounded shuttle fleet to space as soon as 
possible the national aeronautics and space administration chose 
to redesign the challengerstyle boosters a process that took 32 
months instead of the four to five years required to develop an 
entirely new design 
nasa made 145 changes and then subjected the boosters to the 
most rigorous testing program ever conducted for solidfueled 
rockets 
the boosters are the largest solidfueled rockets ever built 
loaded with 11 million pounds of propellant each booster 
weighs 13 million pounds and produces 33 million pounds of 
thrust the two boosters used in each shuttle launch provide 80 
percent of the power need to reach orbit

britain announced friday a resumption of 
full diplomatic ties with iran based on mutual respect it 
accelerated an improvement in western relations with the 
fundamentalist government in tehran 
but secretary of state george p shultz said any us settlement 
with iran required an end to the iraniraq war an end to terrorism 
and the release of americans believed held by proiranian forces in 
lebanon 
iran evidently wants to move toward a more normal position 
around the world but there is no change in the situation as far 
as the united states and iran is concerned shultz said at a news 
conference 
the british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe announced the 
move after meeting with the iranian foreign minister ali akhbar 
velayati both sides have decided to resume full diplomatic 
relations on the basis of reciprocity and mutual respect howe 
said 
velayati referring to negotiations under way in geneva between 
british and iranian representatives said some details remained to 
be worked out howe said the ties would be repaired in due 
course 
in london iranian charge daffaires mohammad basti said full 
diplomatic relations are to be restored and we hope it will be at 
ambassadorial level 
britain pulled its diplomats out of tehran last year after one 
of its envoys was beaten and kidnapped in apparent reprisal for the 
arrest in manchester of an iranian consul on shoplifting charges 
the diplomat edward chaplin was released 24 hours after his 
abduction in tehran on may 28 1987 britain accused iran of 
unacceptable behavior and downgraded relations 
while the two countries did not break diplomatic relations 
their ties were severely strained and only the iranian charge 
daffaires was allowed to remain in london 
howe in a brief session with reporters in a un corridor said 
there was no connection between the decision and any other 
matters 
he apparently referred to terry waite an envoy of the anglican 
church who vanished while on a mission to lebanon and two other 
british hostages 
britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by 
proiranian islamic fundamentalists waite journalist john 
mccarthy and teacher brian keenan a belfast man with dual british 
and irish nationality whose release is also sought by the irish 
government 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a 
new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim 
they killed him his body was never found 
the announcement follows signals from iranian leaders that their 
government was interested in improving relations with western 
countries 
but the united states has stood apart from the trend which 
includes a recent restoration of ties between france and iran and 
improvements in italian west german canadian and turkish 
relations with tehran 
shultz at a separate session with reporters said the 
principal things that need to be dealt with before anything 
genuinely constructive can happen are an end to the war an end to 
terrorism and an end to the hostage problem 
nine americans are among the 17 westerners missing in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press he was abducted march 16 1985 
shultz stressed the united states was prepared to have direct 
talks with iran even though he had no plan to see velayati while 
they were attending the special general assembly session 
what we are doing and have been doing is the right approach 
shultz said we have our views we have our position we have our 
objectives 
us ties with iran were broken after the us embassy in tehran 
was sacked and american diplomats were taken hostage the last 52 
were released in 1981 after being held for 444 days

state game officials said friday that no gator 
bites and only a few capsized airboats had been reported during 
floridas first alligator hunt in 26 years 
the hunting season was to end at midnight friday 
officials said it would take a few weeks to count how many 
gators were bagged since sept 1 by the 238 hunters who won 
licenses by lottery but they say the hunt went off without any 
major problems 
original projections of about 75 percent of the maximum 
3570gator harvest seem accurate officials said 
for grant dunaway the season end will be a chance to lock up 
his alligator processing plant and rest 
weve been going pretty much straight out all month now were 
going to add everything up and see if it was worth it said 
dunaway whose plant near immokalee received about 180 alligators 
hunters were preparing for their final assault on the states 
waterways to reach their 15alligator quota before midnight a 
large bull gator can fetch more than 1000 in hide and meat 
dennis david head of alligator monitoring for the state game 
and fresh water fish commission said hide prices on the 
international market have remained stable at 40 to 44 a foot but 
the hunt dropped local gator meat prices about 25 percent to 4 to 
5 a pound 
mike jennings a wildlife biologist for the game commission 
said the hunt was intended to cut back on the surplus alligator 
population in a way that would allow an annual hunt 
he said the state would try to teach hunters a few more of the 
fine points such as how to tag a gator and fill out paperwork 
i think we covered safety pretty well he said there 
werent any significant injuries people were generally cautious 
a full study on the impact of the hunt on the states estimated 
1 million alligators will be conducted and new rules for next 
years hunt could be adopted in january david said 
some possible revisions could be selecting new sites for the 
hunt and loosening regulations to allow people without permits to 
transport the gators to processing facilities said david 
most infractions against permit holders were minor including 
hunting outside designated boundaries and failing to properly tag 
the catch he said several poachers were caught 
but for the most part were quite pleased with the way the 
hunt was handled said david we didnt have anyone bitten like 
people feared 
veteran trappers had warned that selecting applications randomly 
could lead to injuries among novices but most rookies hired 
experienced guides 
gator hunting is not without its element of danger most 
alligators are delivered to the processing plants still kicking 
their mouths taped shut with duct tape 
hunters skimming marshes and canals by airboat use flashlights 
or headlamps to pinpoint the red eyes of the mostly submerged 
gators they then try to bag them using harpoons grappling hooks 
bows and tethered arrows or bangsticks devices that shoot a 
cartridge on impact 
several airboats capsized but no injuries were reported said 
commission spokesman john white 
state wildlife experts credit strong antipoaching laws adopted 
in 1970 as the main reason the alligator population has doubled in 
the past two decades the alligator was removed from the federal 
endangered species list in 1977 
in lousiana which opened its 17th annual 30day season sept 
10 23800 gators were taken last year 
texas which resumed alligator hunts in 1984 issued permits for 
1500 gators for the 16day season that ended sept 18

the fire smoke and roar of 
thundering rockets captures the attention of the nation but its 
after the shuttle settles quietly into orbit that the real business 
of space travel begins 
getting to space and returning may be the most fun but being 
there is the reason for the whole adventure and the part that is 
least noted by most americans 
nasa officials expressed elation and relief as discovery slipped 
smoothly into orbit the spectacular launch proved to the world 
that americas space agency had recovered from the flawed boosters 
that destroyed challenger 2 years ago killed seven crew members 
and grounded the whole shuttle fleet 
the moment of applause of intense spotlighted attention of 
excitement and public triumph passed within hours now it was time 
to take up again the real purpose of flying in space 
for the astronauts this meant settling into a routine 
controlled rigidly by a script that nasa calls the crew activity 
plan 
the plan is designed to squeeze something useful out every of 
precious astronaut minute in orbit waking sleeping eating and 
working the astronaut in space is directed by the cap 
to make even a slight change in procedures the astronauts are 
supposed to get permission from engineers on the ground mission 
control center is an accurate description of that command post in 
houston 
most of the work of astronauts in space concentrates on the 
grinding routine and small details of scientists and engineers 
exploring a new frontier and trying to build a body of 
understanding progress is inch by inch and is seldom the stuff for 
headlines or for the main story on the evening television news 
harassed astronauts may spend hours working quietly to conclude 
a tedious task and then report the results in a single phrase 
houston step five completed not exactly words that grab 
national attention 
yet it is from such work that the ultimate benefits from space 
will be achieved 
aboard discovery the astronauts are working hour after hour 
conducting experiments in medicine materials processing weather 
observations and communications they seldom take time to chat with 
mission control and when they do they speak in the spare shorthand 
of technical minds hard at work 
its unlikely the fourday mission will provide a major 
breakthrough that overnight will change the lives of people on 
earth but each test will add another bit of new knowledge perhaps 
a single page in a growing library of understanding 
voyages to new frontiers are noted for their beginning and 
ending the hard work in between is seldom recalled who remembers 
what columbus did in the middle of the atlantic on some september 
day in 1492 its his departure for the unknown and his arrival in 
a new world that are honored 
so too for discovery its launch harvested headlines because 
it marked americas return to space and the shuttle landing on 
monday will again capture attention because daring men have 
returned safely to earth but it is the work in between the long 
quiet hours in space that may eventually be the most important

the state department said friday all parties 
to peace negotiations in southwest africa are in agreement that a 
timetable for the withdrawal of cuban troops from angola is 
obtainable 
in an upbeat account of four days of talks this week in the 
congolese capital of brazzaville deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said the process has reached a crucial and likely final phase 
the timetable for the withdrawal of the more than 50000 cuban 
troops has been the most difficult issue in the negotiations since 
they began in their present form last may with the united states 
serving as mediator officials from south africa cuba and angola 
have held seven rounds of talks 
the new york times reported in fridays editions that the 
parties agreed in principal to a 24month withdrawal timetable 
mrs oakley declined to give specifics but her wording 
indicated that the parties are working on a compromise that would 
permit the cubans to remain on longer than the time period sought 
by south africa 
in return the cubans would redeploy their forces away from the 
southern regions of angola the stronghold of the americanbacked 
anticommunist rebel movement 
this is a complex matter in that it involves fixing not only 
the final deadline for the departure of all cuban troops but also 
schedules for their phased redeployment and withdrawal prior to 
that deadline mrs oakley said 
initially south africa with us support had insisted on a 
cuban withdrawal that would coincide with unsupervised elections 
for namibia a process which could begin nov 1 and end with the 
installation of the territorys first independent government in 
1989 south africa has administered namibia for 73 years 
cuba has been holding out for a longer withdrawal period 
apparently concerned that the promarxist government may not be 
able to cope with the powerful rebel movement 
mrs oakley suggested that differences over the timetable have 
narrowed 
all parties perceive that agreement on a timetable for cuban 
troop withdrawal from angola is obtainable she said she also 
suggested that some tentative decisions have been reached by the 
negotiators which require final approval of their respective 
governments 
the negotiations have reached the point at which all parties 
understand the final decisions they must make to achieve an 
agreement she said 
these decisions which affect vital national interests and 
security concerns can only be made at the highest levels of 
government in havana luanda and pretoria

discoverys astronauts having 
consigned the worlds most sophisticated communications satellite 
to its 22300milehigh outpost turned their attention to science 
friday as they whirled around earth in their stockinged feet 
they are having a ball said a flight director 
back at cape canaveral the redesigned booster rockets that 
powered the first postchallenger launch toward orbit thursday were 
towed into port and divers who inspected them said they appeared 
in perfect condition 
the five astronauts were quickly proving to be a quiet 
businesslike crew as they looked down from their 184mile perch at 
interesting ocean currents observed soil erosion in mexico caused 
by hurricane gilbert watched how solutions separate in space and 
did just plain sightseeing over the blue globe below 
conversations were confined to essentials with little banter 
but when a television link with the ground failed to work the 
antenna refused to move into usable position commander frederick 
h hauck offered to help saying well enjoy using our mechanical 
talents 
the antenna problem persisted but its effect on the flight was 
minimal when the same thing happened four years ago the repair 
was performed by an astronaut who was taking a spacewalk anyway no 
such action was contemplated on this flight 
the crew also had to contend with a temperature of 84 degrees in 
the cabin caused by a lingering malfunction in the cooling system 
a cumbersome fix was available but hauck passed it up saying 
were in good shape 
the orbiter is great the systems on board the orbiter are 
doing quite well said j milton heflin a flight director in 
houston weve talked about two or three problems today but my 
goodness out of all the hardware aboard is operating just super 
and i can detect that in the voices of the crew they are having a 
ball 
the astronauts surprised mission control by playing the music of 
i heard it through the grapevine as they were eating lunch it 
was a rejoinder to the days wakeup call from the ground 
good morning discovery robin williams who perfected his 
deejay routine in the movie good morning vietnam prepared the 
tape 
in a televised science lesson from space astronauts george d 
nelson and david c hilmers demonstrated an experiment involving 
cell separation in weightlessness hilmers explained it could have 
medical applications such as separating malignant from 
nonmalignant cells 
in earths gravity when materials like the astronauts are 
testing are mixed the lighter one tends to float to the top 
hilmers said in zero gravity it was more like a yolk floating 
inside the egg white 
the crew also was asked to photograph some of the natural 
phenomena of the planet earth including pacific thunderstorms 
a volcano lava flow in ethiopia and coastal erosion damage from the 
hurricane gilbert on the yucatan peninsula 
the astronauts all have been in space before and there were none 
of the geewhiz expressions that have been a staple of the shuttle 
program 
the worrisome booster rockets that carried the shuttle 
flawlessly at the start of its journey were towed into port 
canaveral near the launch site apparently showing no sign of the 
leaks that doomed the challenger 32 months ago 
the divers report the boosters are in perfect condition 
said rocky raab spokesman for booster manufacturer morton thiokol 
he said the divers who fished the rockets from the atlantic for 
inspection and refurbishment would see evidence if the joint were 
leaking they would see soot and the weather seals would be blown 
off 
there was none of that he said 
since challenger the boosters had undergone a major redesign to 
ensure that the joints between segments would no longer allow hot 
gases to escape a problem on nine previous flights and the 
malfunction that caused the space shuttles destruction with its 
loss of seven lives 
the weather seals are inchthick blankets made like electrical 
tapes that prevent pipes from freezing to keep the joint seals 
pliable at 75 degrees 
raab said it will be two weeks before the rocket shells are 
taken apart for a minute inspection of the seals 
the 2ton tracking and data relay satellite released by the 
crew from discoverys cargo bay late thursday was in its proper 
orbit after a journey of 22000 miles and mission control told the 
crew their launch was with considerable precision 
were there were on orbit were very very happy said ed 
bangsund of boeing manufacturer of the rocket stage that sent the 
satellite to its final orbit the tdrs will join another on orbit 
since 1983 to give nasa communications contact with future shuttles 
85 percent of the time 
it also will serve as an orbital switchboard for up to 24 
satellites including some that will transmit coded military 
information 
the successful deployment was a major boost for nasas tdrs 
program which has had trouble from the start the first satellite 
almost didnt make it when the boeing rocket lost its steering 
ability in an almost miraculous rescue controllers inched it to 
its high orbit over a twomonth period by using small steering 
thrusters the size of a garden hose nozzle 
in 1985 nasa removed a second tdrs from its shuttle cargo 
schedule for redesign because of problems with one in orbit the 
next attempt to launch the satellite was in 1986 it was in the 
cargo bay of the challenger when it exploded after launch 
nasa and the pentagon considered the satellite so important it 
was scheduled as the cargo for the first postchallenger mission 
another is set for launch in january 
the launch and us getting back to space is something that 
really means a lot to me richard truly the nasa shuttle chief 
who supervised the postchallenger recovery said friday and 
looking at todays front pages i think it means a lot to the 
country 
the second days flight plan was deliberately conservative to 
enable the crew to carefully check the scores of system 
modifications made in the spacecraft since the challenger 
explosion were not breaking any new ground pilot richard 
covey said before the launch 
discoverys fourday mission is to end with a landing on the 
desert runway at edwards air force base in california at 1233 pm 
edt on monday

a federal appeals court on friday upheld 
eastern airlines layoff of more than 3000 employees when the 
financially troubled carrier eliminated service to 14 cities to 
stem continuing losses 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals said 
there was insufficient evidence to support contentions of three 
unions that the layoffs were part of an illegal campaign to weaken 
the power of organized labor at eastern 
the unions have directed our attention to nothing that would 
undermine easterns claim that legitimate business concerns provide 
an ample reason for these reductions the court said in an 
opinion by judge stephen williams 
the panel noted that there is no claim that eastern has 
tailored its reductions so as to impose a differential impact on 
union members indeed it appears that the furloughs affect union 
members and nonmembers in roughly their proportions of easterns 
workforce 
the court also ruled that the layoffs of baggage handlers and 
flight attendands were not an illegal change in working conditions 
under the railway labor act which governs labor negotiations in 
the airline and railroad industries 
the court found that us district judge barrington d parker 
had erred in granting the injunction as the furlough was not an 
unlawful change in the status quo 
last month parker had enjoined the layoffs but the appeals 
court had quickly dissolved the preliminary injunction saying 
eastern could proceed to lay off affected employees if it posted a 
47 million bond while the case was appealed 
in a statement from its miami headquarters the airline hailed 
the decision as a very significant positive development for 
eastern airlines 
eastern believes the decision is extremely important because 
the court has reaffirmed managements right to operate its business 
in the best interests of the company its employees shareholders 
and the public the company said 
union spokesmen expressed disappointment with the verdict and 
said no decision had been made on how to proceed 
eastern which has lost 1 billion since 1980 announced the 
layoffs in july as part of a plan to eliminate unprofitable routes 
to 14 cities and close its kansas city hub 
citing losses of 120 million in the first six months of this 
year the company said it was restructuring its operation to 
concentrate service along more profitable east coast routes 
profitable service to latin american points would also be 
maintained 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers the transport workers union of america and the air line 
pilots association contended that the furloughs were merely part 
of an antiunion campaign being waged by easterns parent texas 
air corp 
the pilots union joined the legal challenge even though pilots 
were not being laid off as a result of the schedule changes the 
airline said attrition would account for a reduction in pilot jobs 
the unions argued that the layoffs were part of a plan by texas 
air which acquired the carrier in 1986 to transfer work to its 
nonunion subsidiary continental airlines and sell off profitable 
eastern assets 
judge stephen williams in the opinion joined by judges david 
sentelle and james l buckley found that eastern and texas air 
officials have certainly expressed at least exasperation with 
easterns unions 
but the panel said the present record provides little support 
for any possible finding that forbidden purposes drove easterns 
decisionmaking 
eastern said it will save between 99 million and 199 million 
in annual operating losses if it cut the unprofitable service plus 
daily payroll savings of 160000 from the layoffs 
during the second quarter of this year eastern said it was 
losing 1 million a day 
under schedule changes implemented aug 31 eastern eliminated 
140 of its 1225 daily flights and will sell between 33 and 41 
airplanes 
service was eliminated to albuquerque nm reno and las 
vegas nev minneapolisst paul oklahoma city and tulsa okla 
omaha neb dallas and san antonio texas san diego tucson 
ariz fort de france martinique pointapitre guadeloupe and 
st lucia west indies 
because parker did not have enough time to fully explore the 
claims of antilabor bias the panel said the union should be given 
another opportunity to document their allegations in the lower 
court 
we do not view this decision as the end of the story said 
joseph guerrieri a lawyer representing the iam he said the union 
was studying whether to take the case back to parker or seek a 
rehearing by the full 11member appeals court 
were very disappointed in the decision said nancy currier 
vice president of the transport workers local 553 in miami which 
represents about 6700 eastern flight attendants our legal 
counsel is studying it and will advise us where we can go from 
here 
we are committed to continuing to do whatever we can to stop 
the furlough and bring our people back to work if we cant do it 
through the courts well have to try to restore collective 
bargaining she said 
she said union leaders are preparing to begin contract talks 
with eastern their contract becomes amendable dec 31

william finch has been hauled in twice as a 
deserter and hes not even in the navy because someone 
apparently used his name and social security number to enlist then 
ran off from the uss roosevelt 
were very sensitive to this mans problem and we dont want 
it to happen it again navy spokeswomen lt nancy slivka said 
friday a day after the 22yearold bus driver was released from 
great lakes naval training center in suburban north chicago 
finchs picture would be posted prominently in naval offices 
she said and he will be given another document saying he is not 
the man the navy is seeking 
finch was given such a document after his first arrest in june 
1987 she said but he couldnt produce it when state police 
arrested him sunday at starved rock state park where he was 
fishing when a routine license plate check revealed an outstanding 
warrant in his name 
i was thrown in the la salle county jail overnight and then 
spent 3 days in the brig at great lakes naval training center 
finch said 
ms slivka disputed finchs reference to the brig saying he was 
held in a unit without bars 
but she said great lakes personnel undoubtedly treated him as a 
deserter 
when we go out and pick up a deserter hes not necessarily 
going to come along willingly she said 
experience has told these people they may hear a number of 
different stories based on the information they had in front of 
them they processsed him as if he were a deserter 
finch said his hair was cut short and he was forced to march 
until a federal judge issued an order to free him 
the navy first got its signals crossed with finch on june 3 
1987 when chicago police stopped him for a burnedout taillight 
the desertion warrant turned up during a routine licenseplate 
check that time as well 
after spending a night in jail finch was taken to great lakes 
for questioning and a comparison of descriptions 
he was 5 foot 4 inches i am 5 foot 7 inches he weighed 140 
pounds i weigh 220 he didnt have any scars i have a large scar 
from a kidney operation he was lefthanded i am righthanded 
finch was released immediately that time 
he had more trouble this time because the statistics on the 
deserter had to be mailed from washington ms slivka said 
the navy sent the records by mail on monday assistant us 
attorney thomas walsh said thursday it must have been by route 
of a slow boat to china the records still arent here 
said daniel crowe finchs attorney if the judge hadnt 
agreed to hear the case finch would have been in the brig until 
next week 
telephone calls to crowes office friday for details on the 
court action were not returned finch was not home his mother said 
ms slivka called finchs a very rare and unusual case 
although in a similar one in february 1987 a 27yearold grocery 
clerk was arrested for desertion by the navy 
finch said he bears no ill will toward the navy but is worried 
about missing four days of his job 
and theres one more problem 
finch recently received a letter from the internal revenue 
service it appears the other finch owes uncle sam 900 in back 
taxes 
he is still out there and still using my identity said 
finch who knows what other stuff he has been pulling

republican george bush tweaked rival 
michael dukakis again friday by traveling to the governors home 
state to claim the endorsements of two massachusetts law 
enforcement organizations 
during a day in which he also courted voters in new jersey and 
connecticut with a toughoncrime pitch bush made a foray into 
massachusetts to accept the backing of the international 
brotherhood of police officers local 264 and the springfield 
police supervisors association 
the president of the first group robert jacobson told a small 
gathering outside springfield police headquarters that michael 
dukakis is soft on crime and george bush is tough on crime 
bush called the states prison furlough program under dukakis 
a national disgrace and said he appreciated the endorsement 
because you know the truth not just about me but about my 
opponent as well 
i am running as myself and my opponent is running from 
himself he said 
the bush campaign did not announce the springfield stop until 
about three hours ahead of time to avoid a counterattack by 
dukakis press secretary sheila tate acknowledged 
when bush was recently endorsed by the boston police patrolmens 
association dukakis quickly put together his own big law 
enforcement show of support the same day 
also on friday bush campaigned in new jersey and went into 
heavily democratic paterson county to pick up the endorsement of 
five locals of the police benevolent association 
bush campaign officials said their analysis agrees with local 
polls that show the race even in new jersey which has 16 electoral 
votes and close in connecticut with eight electoral votes 
the campaign is making a concerted push for the middleclass 
democrats who crossed party lines to vote for president reagan 
that appeal was part of fridays lawandorder and antidrug 
message 
in new jersey bush and gov thomas kean also met in the morning 
with a group of black ministers who helped kean in his last 
gubernatorial race 
bush spoke to a rally in paterson where he said he would 
appoint tough judges and support the death penalty for drug 
kingpins and murderers of police officers 
the public address system for bushs outdoor speech was turned 
up as a band of about 30 demonstrators many of them young people 
chanted loudly from across the street where was george 
the motorcade buses were moved into the street blocking the 
protesters view of the rally police officers also stood in the 
streets in front of them 
passaic county sheriff edwin englehardt in his introductory 
remarks said theres half a dozen kids across the street they 
represent the aclu mr vice president but dont worry about that 
the vast majority of people are lawabiding and theyre for you 
bush frequently criticizes the american civil liberties union 
and dukakis membership in it 
the vice president ridiculed dukakis environmental campaign 
trip to new jersey on thursday and took a familiar swipe at the 
water pollution in boston harbor under dukakis governorship 
my opponent had the nerve yesterday to come in here and talk 
about oceans you cant swim in you tried to drink the water in 
boston harbor recently dont do it bush said 
then poking fun at his own misstatement of the date of the 
japanese attack on pearl harbor bush quipped i may have a 
little trouble remembering pearl harbor but i dont have any 
trouble remembering boston harbor 
bush also spoke at ridgefield memorial high school in 
ridgefield nj where he told students to shun drugs and 
encourage their parents not to use drugs he warned against 
enabling behavior in which students keep quiet while their 
friends abuse drugs 
make it uncool to do drugs he said 
bush later headed to hartford conn to meet with roman 
catholic archbishop john whealon and to address a rally at st 
joseph college

union station a magnificent beaux arts 
structure that welcomed train travelers to the nations capital for 
a halfcentury before crumbling into decay in the 1950s came back 
to life on thursday 
today were proud to give you a building brought back to life 
by american business at its best and government at its best union 
station is a train station again said stuart scott president of 
lasalle partners ltd which supervised the 160 million 
rehabilitation project 
more than 100000 red white and blue balloons were released 
confetti rained down and the whistle of an 80yearold steam 
engine blasted as officials swung open the mahogany doors of the 
immense structure and a crowd of thousands swarmed inside 
its magnificent said transportation secretary jim burnley 
were looking at a complete 180degree reversal of the problems 
caused by government incompetence in past projects involving the 
station 
union station had fallen into neglect with the decline in train 
ridership in the 50s and was destined for the wrecking ball when 
it was designated a national landmark in 1964 
the nixon administration spent 48 million trying to convert the 
station into a national visitors center for the nations 
bicentennial in 1976 but the project failed and the doors swung 
shut 
cobwebs gathered in the corners and toadstools sprang up in the 
dirt on the floor over the years train travelers have been 
reaching the capitals amtrak station by way of a temporary walkway 
along the west side of the building 
in 1981 president reagan signed the union station redevelopment 
act which called on the private sector to manage another 
restoration launching the beginning of a sevenyear effort 
the federal government has demonstrated a remarkable level of 
incompetence in years gone by said burnley and we were 
determined that it was going to be done right this time 
the redevelopment team la salle a national real estate firm 
williams jackson ewing a retail developer and leaser and 
architect benjamin thompson amp associates of boston patterned the 
renovation on original architect daniel hudson burnhams 1907 
design 
those who attended the opening many of them employees from 
nearby capitol hill offices strolled through the airy shopping 
mall admiring the high vaulted ceiling with its etched gold finish 
the massive sunfilled main hall of the structure resembles a 
museum with high balconies framing romanstyle statues and arched 
windows 
amtrak has 22 ticket counters and a baggage carousel in the mall 
area some 210000 square feet of retail space will houses many 
upscale shops and a string of restaurants a ninescreen 
2000seat movie theatre is scheduled to open in november 
the district of columbia government is building a parking garage 
for 1500 cars with 40 million in federal highway money lack of 
parking was considered one reason for the failure of the earlier 
renovation effort 
officials are optimistic that with more than 33000 subway 
commuters and 8400 amtrak passengers using the station daily 
combined with the thousands of people who work nearby the new 
union station will be a success

when friends and family gathered to mourn one of two 8yearold 
girls who died after a gunman opened fire in their school wounding 
nine other people 
shequila bradley died in the school after a man identified as 
james william wilson 19 of greenwood walked in monday and began 
shooting 
tequila jones died thursday her funeral was set for sunday 
shequila was the kind of child that always wanted to please 
people if there had been the perfect child she would have been 
it eleanor rice principal of oakland elementary school said at 
fridays funeral 
wilson has been charged with two counts of murder and is 
undergoing psychiatric testing at the state hospital in columbia 
the greenville news reported friday that a state mental health 
center had rejected two attempts since 1986 by wilsons relatives 
to have him involuntarily committed for psychiatric care

the federal aviation administration said 
friday that a further check of its records indicated that south 
pacific island airways has not as the agency said previously 
surrendered its commuter airline operating certificate 
faa spokesman fred farrar said south pacific islands status was 
rechecked after complaints from the airline about its inclusion 
thursday in a list of seven air carriers that the faa said had 
surrendered their certificates before scheduled safety inspections 
south pacific island continues to operate commuter service in 
the america samoa islands although it did turn in a certificate as 
a charter airline after deciding not to continue operating such 
flights farrar said 
meanwhile a spokesman for the parent company of texas national 
airlines of san antonio disputed the faa statement that it had 
surrendered its commuter license 
brian loflin corporate communications director for fairchild 
aircraft corp of san antonio texas said texas national a 
subsidiary of fairchild got out of the commuter business in august 
but did not surrender its certificate and continues flying as a 
charter service 
but farrar said faa records show the airline had surrendered the 
certificate that had allowed it to provide scheduled commuter 
service although he said texas national continues to provide 
ondemand air taxi service 
another airline also disputed faa assertion that it surrendered 
its commuter certificate 
ron warren general manager of grand canyon airlines said the 
airline no longer operates commuter services but continues to fly 
sightseeing charters over the grand canyon 
warren said the certificate it uses for the sightseeing tours is 
the same as its commuter certificate but farrar said while the 
airlines sightseeing flights may not be affected its license to 
operate scheduled commuter service was surrendered 
the airlines were among more than 35 commuter airlines that had 
been targeted for special safety inspections under a broader faa 
probe of the commuter airline industrys compliance with federal 
safety regulations

the kremlin shakeup on friday promoted mikhail s 
gorbachevs friends and pushed out the old guard in a quick 
unanimous vote that harked back to the power plays of his 
preglasnost predecessors 
simultaneously the policymaking communist party central 
committee took the first step toward fulfilling the soviet leaders 
promise of getting the party out of the daytoday management of 
the government 
the decision to eliminate some departments of the party 
bureaucracy and consolidate others means hundreds perhaps 
thousands of the soviet unions top communist party bureaucrats 
will lose their jobs on the powerful staff of the central committee 
a considerable amount of real political power is being 
transferred to the local level said newly promoted politburo 
member vadim medvedev at a news conference after the central 
committee meeting 
he explained that departments traditionally responsible for 
overseeing industrial enterprises throughout the country are being 
eliminated that is designed to shift responsibility for 
decisionmaking to local managers 
this is another step toward moving power out of moscow and the 
central government that is now blamed for the countrys economic 
problems under the system of central planning established by josef 
stalin bureaucrats have long made decisions as minute as how many 
nails should go to the siberian city of novosibirsk 
but in cutting the number of central committee departments from 
approximately 20 to just six gorbachev concentrated power in a 
smaller number of positions and won most of those jobs for his 
supporters 
two of the six are key gorbachev advisers georgy razumovsky 
and alexander yakovlev and two are men elevated to the politburo 
under gorbachevs wing nikolai slyunkov and medvedev 
only one of the six new jobs went to a man considered a 
gorbachev rival yegor ligachev and his transfer from the partys 
no 2 post to agriculture appeared to be a demotion 
these decisions extensive enough to shake the moscow power 
structure to its foundations were made in less than an hour as the 
300member central committee accepted the recommendations of the 
ruling politburo it bore none of the marks of glasnost the 
openness gorbachev championed at the national party conference just 
three months ago 
president andrei gromyko and politburo member mikhail s 
solomentsev retired from their party posts friday were among 
those named in a stunning public criticism at the party conference 
in june as members of the old guard who ought to be removed 
medvedev said the personnel changes were designed to place in 
key positions people who support perestroika gorbachevs 
policy of economic reform and those who enjoy the full trust of 
party members and nonparty members 
the reform relieves soviet industry of an entire top level of 
bureaucrats and eliminates a major overlap of party and government 
by abolishing seven of the eight departments of the partys central 
committee devoted to specific industries 
only agriculture long a serious problem for the soviet union 
will have one of the six new commissions entirely devoted to it 
the other five commissions will be concerned with broad 
policies in line with gorbachevs stated goal of having the party 
give direction rather than detailed orders 
razumovsky will run personnel a key position determining 
hiring firing and promotions yakovlev will be responsible for 
overseeing international affairs 
medvedev an economics professor gets ligachevs former post in 
charge of ideology which will now include the former departments 
of propaganda culture and education nikolai slyunkov who made 
the byelorussian republic an example of gorbachevs economic 
perestroika was given socioeconomic concerns 
viktor m chebrikov the kgb chief gets legal and judicial 
policy an apparent promotion chebrikov may be relieved of the kgb 
post saturday when the nations legislature holds an extraordinary 
session to make personnel changes related to those made by the 
party friday 
more personnel changes are expected saturday and monday when two 
legislative bodies meet to consider changes stemming from the 
central committee decisions 
the supreme soviet of the soviet union is expected to name a new 
kgb chief on saturday since chebrikov is unlikely to hold two such 
important jobs 
on monday the supreme soviet of the russian federation meets 
leading to speculation that the chairman of its council of 
ministers politburo member vitaly i vorotnikov is headed for a 
new assignment 
as many as half the central committees staff members will lose 
their jobs and be transferred to the government universities and 
professional jobs medvedev said 
when asked the current size of that bureaucracy he would say 
only that a reporters estimate of 6000 was several times too 
large 
the central committee staff fills an imposing office complex in 
moscow topped with a red banner 
the transfers will be made very carefully medvedev emphasized 
because the party apparatus has the best personnel they are 
professionals we will try to create favorable conditions for 
them

hours after the nobel peace prize 
was awarded to un peacekeepers six rounds of machinegun fire 
blasted into the hill behind a un observation post near this 
south lebanese village 
its just part of our job said lt arjun sapkota 29 of 
nepal who said being shot at is not an unusual experience here 
the posts 5800 soldiers of the un interim force in lebanon 
or unifil undoubtedly have one of the most difficult missions of 
the seven united nations forces sharing the prize watching 240 
square miles of southern lebanon 
unifil was deployed in 1978 to supervise the withdrawal of an 
israeli invading force but the israelis havent fully withdrawn 
and unifil is sandwiched between them and a myriad of militias that 
have sprouted in lebanon 
it has seemed a mission impossible at times said lt col 
gerry mcmahon of ireland unifils senior operations officer and a 
veteran of un peace missions in zaire cyprus syria and lebanon 
still he said unifil has made a difference in a country 
factionalized by 13 years of civil war and at odds with its israeli 
neighbor 
if unifil didnt exist here this place would be a 
battlefield mcmahon said we have been a stabilizing influence 
in southern lebanon 
unifil troops with headquarters in the southern town of 
naquora can be distinguished by their pale blue helmets and berets 
and the blueandwhite banner that flies above their observation 
posts and roadside checkpoints nepal fiji ireland ghana 
finland norway sweden france and italy contribute to the force 
unifil has paid dearly about 156 men have died in service and 
more than 230 have been wounded two are missing american lt col 
william r higgins leader of a truce observer group attached to 
unifil was kidnapped feb 17 by proiranian shiite moslem 
militiamen 
an irish soldier pvt brian joyce has been missing for seven 
years he has not been seen since he disappeared from a desolate 
outpost 
there is little to suggest the danger will abate soon 
the fact is that we are trying to do our job while what 
amounts to a war is going on around us mcmahon said its 
inevitable we get caught in the middle 
as envisioned by the un security council in 1978 the un 
force was given a mandate to supervise israels withdrawal and help 
the lebanese army reestablish authority in the region 
instead israel continues to hold a strip of land along the 
border as a security zone and augmented its forces with an 
israeliequipped and trained militia known as the south lebanon 
army a christiandominated group 
palestinian guerrillas largely driven out of southern lebanon 
by a second israeli invasion in 1982 have been replaced by 
increasingly militant shiite militias 
the iranbacked hezbollah or party of god is among militias 
hostile to all foreign presence and which continue to try and 
penetrate unifil territory to attack israel 
the un soldiers have ended up being victimized by both sides 
in 1985 the south lebanon army abducted 21 finnish soldiers and 
held them for more than a week after alleging they had helped seven 
of its militiamen defect to moslem groups 
in 1986 several french soldiers were killed in a series of 
attacks blamed on iranianbacked shiite fighters angered over the 
sale of french weapons to irans persian gulf war foe iraq 
eighteen months ago a car bomb exploded beside a fijian 
checkpoint killing three soldiers 
since the start of this year more than 864 incidents have been 
reported in which bullets or artillery fell on or near un 
positions 
but unifil has succeeded to some extent in returning normalcy 
to the more than 500000 people who live in the territory under its 
supervision 
militiamen are not allowed to enter the region with weapons and 
unifil sponsors medical and food relief programs to help the 
largely shiite population 
it does not always succeed in its job as referee 
on friday for example members of the shiite militia amal set 
up a checkpoint on a tiny village road near majdal zoun 
apparently to try to halt any suspected members of the rival 
hezbollah tension between the two militias has been running high 
since three amal leaders were slain last week apparently by 
hezbollah fighters 
meanwhile israel complains that groups intent on attacking the 
jewish state including palestinian guerrillas have made it 
through unifil territory undetected 
we do try to watch everything said nepalese corp arjun 
dahal as he peered trough field glasses at the surrounding hills 
i watch positions for any movement or firing that takes place and 
i report it immediately so we can get it stopped

lloyd bentsen ridiculed george bushs 
education promises saying the vice presidents record on 
education is as empty as dan quayles resume 
the democratic vice presidential nominee addressed an early 
afternoon rally in charlotte before heading to washington to accept 
the national education association endorsement of bentsen and 
presidential nominee michael dukakis the texas senator was taking 
the weekend off to preprare for his debate next week with quayle 
at the rally bentsen thanked north carolina for hosting the 
debate between dukakis and bush and said the showdown proved that 
mike dukakis is the one who is in mainstream america 
every time that mike dukakis starting talking about crucial 
issues that face america about drugs and housing and health care 
and education and social security it seemed that george bush had 
nothing to say for himself bentsen said 
bentsen promoted the democratic tickets chances in the south 
and specifically mentioned texas and north carolina two major 
dukakisbentsen targets 
his text also included arkansas another state where the 
democrats are counting on a win but he did not mention either 
mississippi or alabama states that several dukakis aides have 
conceded privately appear out of reach and among states that will 
be deemphasized in the final weeks of the campaign 
at one point in his speech bentsen mistakenly referred to being 
in south carolina another state where dukakis aides concede 
privately that their chances are slim but quickly corrected 
himself lets get the message to them too he said to laughs 
from the crowd 
bentsen said dukakis had a key southern value fiscal 
conservatism and said it stood in stark contrast to the 
reaganbush record of deficit spending 
george bush likes to talk about balanced budgets bentsen 
said its like dan quayle talking about his resume theres 
nothing to say 
he adopted a similar line for his later speech to the nea 
convention in washington 
george bush woke up one morning and decided he wanted to be 
the education president but there is no evidence that he has ever 
lifted a hand to help education in america ill tell you 
bentsen said in the text of that address his record on education 
is as empty as dan quayles resume 
the senator in the speech to the labor group said the reagan 
administration as undermined a number of education programs 
including funding for college loans remedial education and teacher 
improvement 
bentsen said dukakis the massachusetts governor had taken his 
state from 40th to 10th in terms of perstudent spending while also 
supporting programs to improve teacher quality he also touted 
dukakis proposal to allow students to repay college loans through 
longterm payroll deductions 
at the north carolina rally which was attended by about 500 
people bentsen promised a strong national defense and an 
administration ready to pay the price to defend freedom 
as for the debate bentsen told reporters aboard his plane he 
would spend most of the weekend preparing and practicing advisers 
who helped dukakis prepare for his debate are part of the bentsen 
effort

pope john paul ii on friday ruled out the 
priesthood for women but condemned sexual discrimination in a major 
teaching that will shape the debate on women in the roman catholic 
church 
mulieris dignitatem latin for on the dignity of women 
attempts to define womens nature and role in the church and 
society 
the document concludes that men and women are equal but 
fundamentally different and thus play different roles women it 
says are formed by maternal qualities 
john paul says women who choose celibacy as a vocation such as 
nuns accept a spiritual motherhood 
while highly theoretical the document provides a framework for 
specific issues the church is expected to tackle in coming years 
such as the positions and influence women can have in the church 
structure 
the ban on women priests and deacons has been a source of 
considerable tension between the vatican and catholics in the 
united states and western europe 
the 120page document is an apostolic letter which means it 
will be presented to roman catholics as church teaching but is not 
an infallible pronouncement 
here the holy father is offering us the essential and 
inescapable facts and principles that you need to sensibly debate 
the role and mission of women archbishop jan schotte said at a 
news conference where the document was presented 
its not new in terms of content but its new in bringing 
together the teaching of scriptures and the whole tradition of the 
church in a document that speaks to the theme of women now he 
said 
schotte was secretarygeneral of last years worldwide synod of 
bishops on the role of the laity the question of women played a 
major role at the synod 
vatican officials said the document expresses the popes beliefs 
shaped by years of reflection on the subject of women but did not 
involve scientists or other outside experts 
much of the document consists of a strong defense of womens 
equality with men and praise for their contributions the pope 
equates sexual discrimination and domination over women with sin 
and condemns men who fail to take responsibility for their sexual 
acts 
he advises fathers 
it is the woman who pays directly for this shared generation 
of a child it is therefore necessary that the man be fully 
aware that in their shared parenthood he owes a special debt to the 
woman no program of equal rights between women and men is valid 
unless it takes this fact fully into account 
but the pope stated that women and men have fundamentally 
different characters 
the personal resources of femininity are certainly no less 
than the resources of masculinity they are merely different the 
document said 
hence a woman as well as a man must understand her 
fulfillment as a person her dignity and vocation on the basis 
of these resources 
the pope links femininity to maternal characteristics such 
as sensitivity to human beings and a sense of responsibility for 
others 
a womans vocation he said lies in devoting herself to other 
people either through motherhood or spiritual motherhood in 
which a woman chooses longterm virginity to focus on a mission of 
service 
the document emphasusus christs respect for women and says his 
behavior showed he did not follow the norms of his times thus the 
pope argues christ was not affected by the traditions of his day 
when he chose men as his top apostles but intended that only they 
should fill that role 
he added that christ celebrated the eucharist with men and that 
the sacrament symbolizes the sacrifice men should make in marriage 
in the catholic faith the consecration of the eucharist 
commemorates christs giving of himself for the church 
christ in instituting the eucharist wished to express the 
relationship between man and woman between what is feminine and 
what is masculine the pope wrote 
schotte said the arguments against women priests also appeared 
to rule out women deacons a subject of intense interest in the 
us catholic church 
in a draft pastoral letter issued last spring the us bishops 
called for a study of making women deacons deacons are ordained 
ministers who rank below priests 
the vatican is facing increasing pressure from women for a 
greater role in the church an issue that has been fueled by the 
recent elevating of a female bishop in the episcopal church 
vatican officials said the pope issued his document now to 
provide theological underpinning for church decisions in the coming 
months on women

the fbi discriminates against hispanics a 
federal judge ruled friday saying the agency is slow to promote 
hispanic agents and assigns them lessdesirable jobs 
us district judge lucius bunton said the 311 hispanic agents 
who sued the fbi demonstrated a pattern and practice of 
discrimination relating to conditions of employment and 
promotions 
bunton said the issue of damages will be decided in later 
hearings possibly beginning in late november 
attorneys for the agents said the decision could change 
employment practices in government and private industry 
the decision says discrimination exists in the department of 
justice if it exists there it does in other places said lawyer 
hugo rodriguez 
its a landmark decision because discrimination against 
hispanics is pervasive said antonio silva another plaintiff 
lawyer 
an fbi spokesman said a bureau response would be issued later 
friday 
the hispanic agents won nearly all the points they set forth 
but the judge said they did not prove the fbi retaliated against 
them for their involvement in the suit bunton said however 
there was evidence the bureau retaliated against the lead 
plaintiff bernardo m perez 
perez the no 2 man in the el paso fbi office filed the suit 
in january 1987 alleging the fbi discriminates against hispanics 
in promotion discipline and assignments he asked for 5 million 
in damages and changes in fbi policies 
until i read the document i was very apprehensive perez 
said i am very pleased i am very happy justice does prevail in 
the united states of america 
the fbi has 9574 agents of which 437 or 45 percent are 
hispanic hispanics make up about 8 percent of the general us 
population 
during a twoweek nonjury trial in august about 30 agents 
testified that hispanic agents are given lessdesirable 
assignments are afforded less recognition for their successes and 
are not promoted as quickly as nonhispanics 
the fbi rebutted those claims with testimony from the three 
agents who work directly under fbi director william sessions other 
witnesses and statistical evidence 
in his 98page opinion bunton said he agreed with the hispanic 
agents claims that they were usually sent to listen to 
spanishlanguage wiretaps even if there were nonhispanic agents 
available who understood spanish better 
noting that wiretaps are a hardship because of long shifts 
cramped quarters and long stays away from home bunton wrote 
hispanic agents suffer disparate treatment in the conditions of 
their employment and these conditions affect their promotional 
opportunities in an adverse manner 
bunton agreed with the plaintiffs allegations that hispanic 
agents often are called off major cases to work on lesser cases 
where they can use their spanishspeaking ability then are denied 
credit for work on the cases they were taken away from 
bunton wrote that he understood the fbi needs spanishspeaking 
agents but that the need for such agents does not justify 
benefit and promotion systems which do not reward hispanic agents 
in a manner commensurate with their admitted contribution to the 
bureau 
at news conference friday afternoon rodriguez said hispanic 
employees from several government agencies and private corporations 
have contacted him seeking advice about alleged discrimination

the 15 million race between new jersey sen 
frank lautenberg and republican peter dawkins has reached such a 
level of nastiness that the challenger describes the contest as a 
barroom brawl 
in the past few weeks dawkins has put television commercials on 
the air that brand lautenberg as an extreme liberal in the 
tradition of actress jane fonda and former sen george mcgovern 
lautenberg has fired back with his own ads accusing dawkins a 
michigan native of being a carpetbagger 
this is going to be a tough rock emsock em 15 rounds no 
hold barred dawkins says this is a barroom brawl 
the two men in the race come from widely differing backgrounds 
and styles 
lautenberg 64 made his fortune in the computer business and 
won his first term in the senate in 1982 coming from behind in the 
race against millicent fenwick 
dawkins 50 is a retired army brigadier general rhodes 
scholar with hollywood good looks and a paradeground presence 
the two sides say theyll spend between 7 million and 8 
million each mainly buying expensive new york and philadelphia 
television time 
while prelabor day campaigning focused on issues both 
candidates have detoured in the final stretch of the campaign 
lautenberg has aired tv spots that accuse dawkins of using new 
jersey as a political pit stop and of exaggerating his 
alreadyimpressive resume cmon pete be real is a lautenberg 
campaign slogan 
lautenberg who cofounded and ran the worldwide automatic data 
processing corp has stood in the political shadow of fellow sen 
bill bradley dnj who is touted every four years as 
presidential stock 
and because new jersey with no statewide newspaper or 
television channel is blanketed by the giant media markets of new 
york and philadelphia lautenberg has been frustrated in drawing 
news media attention to himself new york mayor edward koch is a 
more familar face to many new jersey viewers than their junior 
senator 
lautenberg insists he has done a good job for new jersey but 
acknowledges not enough constituents connect his name with his 
record 
but lautenberg says when they hear that i wrote the law to 
put people who dump plastics in the ocean in jail they love it 
dawkins despite arriving in the state just last year has 
gained the loyalty of most republicans however hes been bruised 
by some unflattering press and an insensitive gaffe in april 
after he settled in the posh suburb of rumson nj dawkins 
confessed to reporters hed rather be in washington id blow my 
brains out if i had to live in a small town he said 
once stiff almost arrogant dawkins has begun to loosen up he 
is greeted as a star and delivers a practiced campaign speech that 
blends pride in new jersey with lautenbergbashing 
top new jersey republicans courted dawkins away from wall 
street where he prospered after leaving the army in 1983 
born in michigan and a childhood victim of polio dawkins was 
an academic and athletic star at west point winning the 1959 
heisman trophy he studied at oxford as a rhodes scholar and 
earned a phd at princeton in a 24year army career dawkins was 
a vietnam hero and at 43 an unusually young brigadier general 
yet lautenberg and his aides have repeatedly accused dawkins of 
gilding the lily 
the challengers campaign was caught adverstising dawkins as 
wounded in vietnam which he was not early campaign literature 
said dawkins served two tours in the asian conflict he served one 
full tour and returned for a few months in a noncombat role 
dawkins corrected the exaggerations himself 
like dawkins lautenberg has an impressive background 
raised in poverty he served in the army in world war ii and 
went to college on the gi bill he cofounded the adp corp and 
in 30 years amassed a fortune estimated near 40 million

president reagan trying to score political 
points for george bush in the midwest said friday their 
administration has worked to recover bedrock values after 
taking the white house from the democrats 
there really are only two things the liberals dont understand 
the things that change and the things that dont reagan told 
some 1500 people gathered for lunch at wozniaks casino a polish 
social club 
noting that he once was a democrat the president told the crowd 
that the present leadership of the party is out of step with the 
rankandfile 
the liberals may try to mouth some of our words but when they 
talk about values and family they mean something very 
different he said 
reagans trip to chicago was aimed at helping bush with 
conservativeminded democrats and independent voters in ethnic 
communities many of whose votes reagan and bush won while 
carrying illinois in 1980 and 1984 
the president said that the republican party represented the 
best hopes of people seeking liberation of eastern european nations 
he called the munich pact in 1938 the naive appeasement that 
brought us the great nightmare of this century the second world 
war 
the sad lesson is that to be weak is to invite war he said 
and george bush and i will not rest until freedom is restored to 
all the peoples of eastern europe 
without mentioning the name of democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis reagan suggested that bush had fared better than 
the massachusetts governor in last sundays nationally televised 
debate 
reagan taking a new slap at dukakis membership in the american 
civil liberties union said you know after the debate i had to 
say isnt that just like an aclu member he didnt have a prayer 
when he needed one 
over the last eight years america has begun a great 
enterprise of resurrection he said we have worked to recover 
the bedrock values that you and most americans never departed 
from 
we have rebuilt our defenses our country is at peace our

while americans rejoice in the safe launch 
of space shuttle discovery tim whiting is getting tired of 
answering his telephone 
whiting owner of napa auto supply in coloma has a toll free 
number 1800999napa which is being confused with a 900 number 
for shuttle news 
the number to call to hear shuttletoground conversation and 
periodic updates on the mission is 1900909nasa 
apparently some radio stations were incorrectly promoting 
1900999nasa as the space hotline number that is close to 
whitings number since both napa and nasa translate on a telephone 
into the numerals 6272 
whiting said he began receiving the strange phone calls even 
before the thursday morning launch and about 30 had come in by the 
time he closed his store 
whiting called his mci to see if his 800 number could be 
disconnected for the day he was told a change in the number would 
take two weeks 
in the meantime he will have to pay for the incorrect 
tollfree calls

the american civil liberties union attacked 
by vice president george bush as the incarnation of ideas that 
voters loathe will embark on a 250000 effort to tell americans 
its only cause is the bill of rights

california announced the campaign thursday at a news conference 
and played two commercial taped for the organization by actor burt 
lancaster who tells viewers i have a confession to make im a 
cardcarrying member of the aclu 
the reference to being a cardcarrying member is the same 
one bush has used to describe massachusetts gov michael dukakis up 
to and including sundays nationally televised debate bush claimed 
dukakis aclu membership showed how out of touch he was with 
americans 
dukakis did not defend the organization during the debate and 
the day afterward his campaign issued a list of aclu positions with 
which he disagrees 
other commercials for the 68yearold aclu will be made next 
week by jill eikenberry and michael tucker the husbandandwife 
actors who portray married lawyers on the la law television 
series 
goldberg a talent manager whose previous battles have included 
thwarting the movement to rate records according to their lyric 
content said people associate the aclu with the oftenunpopular 
causes and groups it defends 
he said the campaign is designed to show americans that our 
one client is the bill of rights he said the defense of 
constitutional principles such as separation of church and state 
the rights of groups to speak and march and the rights of accused 
people leads the aclu to represent such groups as the ku klux klan

an interagency review committee probably will 
recommend steps in yellowstone national park to prevent the 
centurylong buildup of dead trees that made this summers fires so 
destructive interior secretary donald p hodel said thursday 
and the chief ranger of the national park service said 
controlled burning hasnt been done before in yellowstone because 
the predominant species there lodgepole pine is almost impossible 
to burn under control 
hodel told two senate subcommittees that he and agriculture 
secretary richard lyng on monday named members of a panel of 
experts to make recommendations for changes in firefighting 
policies by dec 15 the panel was instructed to consult other 
experts in universities state governments and other places outside 
the federal establishment 
lyngs department controls the forest service the agency with 
the dominant role in fighting most fires on government land 
hodels department is in charge of the national park service which 
runs yellowstone 
i would expect them to come back with a recommended means of 
trying to reduce the fuel i dont think anybody can tell me what 
that will be hodel told the agriculture nutrition and forest 
subcommittee of the agriculture committee and the public lands and 
parks subcommittee of the energy and natural resources committee 
the hearing was called to ventilate complaints of western 
senators that the let it burn policy of the park service in 
effect since 1972 had led to a disaster for the park 
although other parks have employed controlled burns to 
regenerate the land they had never been used in yellowstone 
despite the buildup of dead trees from almost a century of trying 
to put out every fire 
walt dabney the chief ranger said the only time that 
material lodgepole pine will burn successfully is when its very 
very dry and there are winds to move the fire along 
to light a fire when its dry and windy youre in the same 
situation we were in this year its very hard to control he 
testified 
dale robertson chief of the forest service said his agency 
would plant new trees where needed but william penn mott director 
of the park service said yellowstone plantings would be limited to 
native grasses and wildflowers along the roads and along trout 
streams if necessary to hold back erosion from bare ground 
lodgepole pine needs fire to burst cones and throw seeds on the 
ground seed counts mott said show 50000 per acre more than 
one per square foot where the hottest fires burned and up to a 
million per acre elsewhere 
we dont need seeds mott said 
in midjuly the park service decided to fight all the fires in 
yellowstone some of which had entered from forest service land 
outside the park hodel confirmed the decision during a visit there 
july 22 
some senators expressed skepticism that the park service really 
was trying to put out the fires and sen john melcher dmont 
chairing the hearing asked was what secretary hodel wanted 
done done 
hodel said his conversations with firefighters on another visit 
in september led him to conclude his wishes were not being 
sabotaged many of the people he talked with were not from the park 
service but experts from other agencies and they were making the 
best decisions they could make 
senators also expressed skepticism that the park service could 
assess the spring as normal or wetter than normal when nearby 
counties were crying for drought relief but hodel said such data 
may well have lulled us into a false sense of security he said 
he was awaiting the compilation of a detailed chronology to see 
when the extra dry conditions in yellowstone became visible 
senators also expressed dismay that publicity about the fires 
would keep tourists away next year and hodel said the park was 
very much worth viewing fully onehalf of the park has not 
been touched and fully onehalf of the area that has been touched 
very shortly will appear not to have been 
although the area suffered economically said sen malcolm 
wallop rwyo probably more important we suffered 
emotionally

senate democrats laid down an electionseason 
challenge to the gop on thursday by moving to combine a 25 
billion child care initiative with a hybrid antipornography and 
parental leave bill 
everybody claims they want to do something for families 
said sen christopher dodd dconn sponsor of two of the three 
measures heres the chance 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva made the move after his 
republican counterpart minority leader bob dole of kansas said he 
could offer no deal to limit amendments or schedule a vote on the 
pornographyleave bill 
the leave component sponsored by dodd requires businesses with 
more than 50 employees to give workers at least 10 weeks of leave 
to cope with a newborn newly adopted or seriously ill child or a 
workers own serious illness 
some of the most adamant opponents of the leave bill worked 
vigorously this week to add to it a measure strengthening laws and 
penalties against child pornography and obscenity that part was 
sponsored by sen strom thurmond rsc 
the child care section would be modeled on the act for better 
child care services a democratic initiative centered on subsidies 
to help families pay for day care dodd was the sponsor 
dodd said he and sen orrin hatch rutah a leading 
conservative player in the child care arena had agreed on a 
compromise authorizing the same amount of money federal staff 
health and safety standards still would be required of centers and 
homes receiving federal money but governors could seek temporary 
variances for counties or other parts of their states having 
trouble with compliance 
a separate tax provision would be proposed either on the floor 
or as part of a tax technical corrections bill dodd said he said 
it would involve the earned income tax credit but declined to give 
details 
dodd labeled the childrens package the thurmondhatchdodd 
proposal 
while this is a little cumbersome i admit and were running 
out of time i admit i dont think were that far apart dodd 
said 
dole in his floor exchange with byrd labeled the trio of bills 
a total political agenda and said senators should be spending 
their time on tax corrections and an antidrug bill issues that 
affect the public interest not the political interest 
dole said the republicans might offer a motion to kill or 
indefinitely postpone a vote on byrds proposal which involves 
sending the leavepornography bill back to committee to be fused 
with doddhatch child care compromise and swiftly returned to the 
floor 
if that happens dodd said they bear the responsibility of 
this package of legislation dying in this congress

an eccentric scholar serving a threeyear 
sentence for trying to sell valuable letters from government 
libraries was convicted thursday of possessing a gun and drugs 
found in safety deposit boxes 
a us district court jury convicted charles merrill mount on a 
felony charge of illegally possessing a 32caliber pistol and two 
misdemeanor counts of possessing more than 1000 barbiturates 
mount already serving a threeyear sentence for trying to sell 
valuable letters to a boston bookstore could receive up to five 
years imprisonment for the weapons conviction and oneyear terms 
for each of the two drug possession counts 
jurors who deliberated nearly four hours following the twoday 
trial declined to convict mount of the more serious charges of 
felony possession with intent to distribute prescription drugs 
mount the son of a brooklyn physician who affects a british 
accent and carries a cane in the style of an edwardian gentleman 
contended that he kept the pills to prove that his late father was 
a drug addict 
he testified that pills were to be used as evidence in court to 
contest the will in which his father dr abraham suchow had 
disinherited him 
mount had been convicted in 1982 of making threatening telephone 
calls to his mother during the bitter court fight over his fathers 
will 
mount who was born seymour suchow also was convicted in 1984 
of filing a false passport application 
on may 24 mount was sentenced in boston to three years 
imprisonment for transporting stolen documents including letters 
by abraham lincoln and winston churchill that belonged to the 
library of congress and the national archives 
mount 60 was arrested aug 13 1987 while trying to sell 
letters and papars signed by lincoln and several civil war generals 
to goodspeeds bookshop in boston 
he is awaiting trial in washington on 17 additional counts of 
receipt of stolen property stemming from the hundreds of civil war 
documents the fbi said were found in two safety deposit boxes mount 
kept under assumed names 
it was in those boxes searched following mounts arrest in 
boston that agents found the barbiturates and the pistol 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr did not schedule a 
sentencing date for mount on the gun and drug convictions 
robinson also refused a request by defense attorney david h 
williams to order the government to turn over a painting that mount 
had deeded to the law firm to help pay legal expenses 
assistant district attorney scott l fredericksen said the 
painting and other items seized last year from mounts capitol hill 
apartment were being examined by the fbi as part of its continuing 
investigation 
fredericksen told the judge there was evidence that mount an 
accomplished portrait painter and art historian had painted the 
picture himself forged claude monets signature and tried to sell 
it as an original of the famous french artist 
an art expert had identified the monet signature as a forgery 
fredericksen said 
mount a former guggenheim fellow is the author of biographies 
of american painters john singer sargent gilbert stuart and monet 
according to the fbi mount frequented the manuscript collection 
at the library of congress and the archives where he gained access 
to valuable documents

the government thursday sued a former us 
attorney in cleveland for failing to report loans on a financial 
disclosure form while he was a federal prosecutor 
the justice department complaint in us district court in 
cleveland seeks 20000 in civil penalties from j william petro 
for alleged violations of the financial disclosure provisions of 
the ethics in government act of 1978 
petro was fired as a federal prosecutor in 1984 amid a justice 
department probe of his activities and eventually was convicted of 
disclosing the contents of a sealed indictment 
the suit says petro submitted a disclosure form in october 1981 
reporting no liabilities to creditors when a man named carl 
glickman had supplied petro with a 15000 loan the previous month 
the complaint says an individual identified only as lozick 
loaned petro 120000 in 1982 but that the us attorney didnt 
report either that obligation or the glickman loan on his 
disclosure form for that year 
in addition the government says petro failed to report the 
glickman or lozick obligations or an additional 15000 in loans 
from lozick for 1983 nor did he report the glickman loan on an 
amended form for 1983 
president reagan on oct 3 1984 ordered that petro be 
dismissed immediately as us attorney in cleveland at a time when 
the justice department was investigating petro in connection with 
the possible leaking of information concerning a criminal 
investigation 
a federal court jury on march 7 1985 in baton rouge la 
convicted petro of criminal contempt for disclosing the contents of 
a sealed indictment 
cleveland businessman howard schulman had a conversation with 
petro about the indictment and then schulman told details to one of 
the defendants a close friend stanley moss 
moss and several others were charged in the indictment with 
fraud involving the alleged sale of counterfeit merchandise 
petro then 44 testified he didnt know the indictment was 
sealed when he revealed its contents 
a man who answered the telephone at the cleveland address listed 
in the complaint denied that he was the petro named in the suit and 
said no such person lived at that address 
in an unrelated matter the government also announced it is 
suing an alaska man under the ethics in government act for 
allegedly neglecting until this year to file a federal financial 
disclosure form in connection with his candidacy in 1986 for the 
us senate 
the government has brought a total of four civil suits under the 
ethics act the other two were against constance hansen the wife 
of former us rep george hansen and steve tarver a republican 
candidate from wyoming running for the us senate both mrs 
hansen and tarver paid civil penalties in connection with financial 
disclosure requirements mrs hansen was a government employee as 
well as a congressional candidate

two of her babies and tried to kill a third because she was 
depressed after childbirth was found innocent of murder and

lawyer michael dowd hugged her as jury foreman andrew kessler 
pronounced the verdict her 54yearold husband larry wept 
state supreme court justice stephen crane let mrs green remain 
free in 125000 bail and directed her to undergo psychiatric 
evaluation within 30 days he scheduled a hearing on the 
psychiatric report for oct 28 
i know i need help mrs green said after the verdict and 
ill continue to seek it ill just take it one day at a time 
crane after hearing the psychiatric report may commit mrs 
green for treatment or if she is not considered dangerous release 
her from custody 
larry green a former building superintendent who says he is 
dying of cancer said he and his wife had come through three 
years of hell but because the jury was intelligent and 
merciful he said we have just been delivered from a 
terrible ordeal 
mrs green admitted she smothered two of her babies in 1980 and 
1982 by putting pillows over their faces she said she tried to 
kill a third the same way in 1985 but a neighbor also a pediatric 
nurse resuscitated the infant that child a boy lives with 
relatives

always seemed that someone else was doing it i was not fully 
aware of what happened to my babies or why she said

prosecution say mrs green contrary to defense claims was 
criminally responsible for her childrens deaths kessler a

to have a thorough familiarity with mrs greens history so as to 
win our trust 
assistant district attorney marybeth richroath charged that mrs 
green smothered her infants when they were just days old because 
they annoyed her with their crying 
the prosecutor said the defendant was fully aware of what she 
was doing and had taken steps to conceal her actions 
mrs richroath said mrs green lied to her husband and doctors 
about what happened to the babies and said she sought psychiatric 
help only after a physician said he suspected foul play in the near 
death of her third child

the president has no authority to prohibit 
humanitarian aid to foreign countries a federal judge said in a 
ruling supporting a group that bucked the government and took 
vehicles to nicaragua 
the veterans peace convoy filed suit while it fought with the 
government over plans to take vehicles filled with donated goods to 
nicaragua 
the group eventually was able to take 30 of the groups 38 
vehicles across the border at laredo in july most of the vehicles 
are in nicaragua 
us district judge george p kazens ruling issued friday 
limits the scope of the international emergency economic powers 
act the basis for the reagan administrations economic embargo of 
nicaragua 
the act contains an exemption for humanitarian aid the reagan 
administration had been interpreting it on a casebycase basis 
the court said and refusing to allow export of certain items 
including cars and trucks 
kazens ruling said because of the exemption in the economic 
powers act the president has no authority to regulate or prohibit 
us citizens donations to foreign countries which the donor 
intends to be used to relieve human suffering 
specifically the foreign assets control office part of the 
treasury department cannot require donors to get licenses before 
exporting such aid kazen said the act was cited when the office 
temporarily barred the veterans donation of vehicles to nicaraguan 
schools hospitals and churches 
plaintiffs in the case said the ruling clears the way for 
further aid to nicaragua 
we consider it an important victory we actually got a much 
broader ruling than we had expected said tom hansen former 
coordinator of veterans for peace 
hansen last week joined pastors for peace a detroitbased group 
which hopes to send a similar convoy to nicaragua in 1989 donating 
to nicaraguan groups will be much easier now that us citizens 
dont have to worry about getting licenses he said in a telephone 
interview 
a treasury department spokesman who spoke on condition he not 
be named said we have not seen the decision yet it will be 
reviewed by the treasury and justice departments he declined 
further comment 
the veterans peace convoy collected donations in 100 cities in 
42 states last spring before converging in laredo ten hours before 
the veterans planned crossing into mexico us customs notified 
them they couldnt go hansen said four of the vehicles were 
confiscated 
when the case came to trial the government argued there was no 
reason to hear it because the vehicles had been allowed to cross 
and the impounded ones had been returned to the owners 
kazen said the plaintiffs vehicles could be subject to seizure 
in the future he also noted the plaintiffs are under continuing 
threat of criminal and civil prosecution 
justice department spokesman brad marman had no immediate 
response friday when asked what government policy would be in light 
of the decision other than to say the department always abides by 
court decisions he said justice officials had not seen the ruling

papandreou underwent openheart surgery friday and a greek embassy 
spokesman said everything is fine 
dr nicholas papadakis the greek embassy press attache added 
the operation was successful 
greek officials at the hospital said a team headed by magdi 
yacoub britains top heart surgeon performed the sixhour 
operation on the 69yearold socialist prime minister at harefield 
hospital north of london 
the prime ministers four children and his girlfriend airline 
stewardess dimitra liani 34 were at the hospital throughout the 
surgery 
papandreous condition was listed as satisfactory vasilis 
kapetanyannis a greek embassy press officer at the hospital said 
late friday night 
shortly after the operation hospital general manager david 
thomson told reporters that papandreou underwent an operation for 
replacement of his aortic valve using a human valve this was 
combined with insertion of three bypass grafts and the clearing of 
the diseased coronary artery to improve the heart function 
the team of doctors who performed the operation is pleased 
with his progress so far thomson said 
in keeping with medical practice in britain the name of the 
donor of the heart valve was not revealed 
in athens staterun television interrupted evening programs 
with a special news bulletin to say surgery was a success and that 
the prime ministers doctors are absolutely satisfied 
papandreou head of the governing panhellenic socialist movement 
and president of the 12nation european economic community flew to 
london aug 25 after his heart condition suddenly worsened greece 
does not have a hospital where a complex openheart operation like 
his could be performed 
he underwent presurgical treatment at harefield for a narrowing 
of the aorta the main blood vessel carrying blood from the heart 
greek officials said the main operation was delayed a month to 
clear a liver disorder linked to the heart problem 
waiting in a hospital corridor away from the news media were his 
four adult children several government ministers and ms liani 
whose public appearances walking handinhand with papandreou have 
become a hot issue in the greek press 
after papandreou arrived in britain the greek government 
announced he would divorce margaret papandreou his americanborn 
wife of 37 years prompting speculation that he planned to marry 
ms liani 
mrs papandreou is not in london according to the embassy

socialist movement and won a second fouryear term at national 
elections held in 1985 
he is the dominant personality in greek politics and reserves 
most decisionmaking for himself his fourweek absence from athens 
has markedly slowed government activity according to socialist 
officials 
opposition conservatives from the new democracy party complain 
papandreous refusal to appoint a standin while hes away is 
unconstitutional and has left a power vacuum 
his deputies are defense minister yiannis haralambopoulos who 
handles ceremonial occasions and justice minister menios 
koutsogiorgos who supervises daytoday running of the government 
both have deputy premier status 
but during his hospitalization papandreou has stayed in close 
touch with his cabinet by telephone and telefax and senior cabinet 
ministers have flown to london to get instructions

the seattle times is breaking a virtually 
rocksolid tradition of supporting republican presidential 
candidates and endorsing democrat michael dukakis this year 
the endorsement announced friday said that with five weeks 
left before the election nov 8 the massachusetts governor had 
shown a broader deeper understanding of the economies of the 
states and nation 
the editorial endorsing dukakis will appear in the newspapers 
sunday editions 
gov michael dukakis is conspicuously the best choice to lead 
america as its president through the coming four years the 
editorial said 
vice president george bush must share responsibility with 
president reagan for the potentially catastrophic federal deficit 
and the widening financial gap between the welloff whove 
gained handsomely and the tens of millions of middleclass and poor 
americans who are today relatively worse off the editorial said 
dukakis also was chosen on the basis of his support for 
education civil rights defense clean government and choice of a 
running mate 
bush wraps himself in the flag exploits emotions surrounding 
the issue of abortion casts doubt on the patriotism of his 
opponent and attacks the american civil liberties union the 
editorial said 
these tactics suggest that bush is a small man fearfully 
marching backward toward the 1940s rather than being a leader who 
can inspire america and its citizens to higher thoughts and deeds 
the endorsement announcement said a search of internal times 
files going back to 1920 showed that the only time the larger of 
the citys two daily papers failed to support a republican for 
president was in 1964 when neither republican barry goldwater nor 
democratic president lyndon b johnson was endorsed

on women whose lives are not threatened 
the house bill still to be considered by the senate also would 
allow georgetown university to go back on its agreement to allow 
gay student associations to meet on campus and apply for student 
government funds 
the roman catholic school had reached an agreement with the gay 
groups in march after the district of columbia superior court and 
court of appeals upheld a finding by the citys human rights office 
that georgetown was discriminating against gay groups georgetown 
officials have said that they will not go back on their agreement 
with the student groups regardless of what congress decides 
del walter fauntroy ddc angered by the intrusion into 
local affairs said he would encourage city officials to disobey 
the abortionfunding prohibition to trigger a congressionally 
mandated shutdown of city government such a move would leave 
congress with the responsibility of governing the nations capital 
you will forgive me having respected you for 18 years if i 
suggest to my mayor and people that work for this city government 
that maybe its time to end this facade a tearful fauntroy told 
his house colleagues in a meeting where the final touches were put 
on the budget if congress wants to decide every little detail 
maybe its time to do that 
david clarke chairman of the district of columbia council 
concurred with fauntroy saying i believe it is time for the 
people of the district of columbia to take to the streets to defend 
their constitutional rights 
the abortion measure offered by rep robert dornan rcalif 
toughens current legislation which allows the city to use locally 
generated funds for abortions and restricts federal funds for use 
by rape and incest victims women suffering through ectopic 
pregnancies or when the mothers life is threatened

about 1500 cubans requested meetings with a un 
human rights delegation that returned from cuba this week many of 
them complaining that they were barred from leaving the country an 
official said friday 
the delegation which stayed in cuba for 10 days was the first 
of its kind to visit the caribbean island nation since president 
fidel castro came to power in 1959 
the sixmember team only had time to meet with 86 of the 1500 
cubans who requested meetings delegation chairman alioune sene of 
senegal told a news conference 
he said the 86 represented a crosssection of the different 
allegations of human rights abuses that the group received 
the allegations included bad treatment temporary 
disappearances illegal and arbitrary detention and lack of 
religious freedom sene said 
he said a good part of the total 1500 written requests were 
from people who said they were barred from emigrating many wanted 
to join family members living in other countries but some said 
they would go anywhere sene said 
he declined to comment on any specific cases 
in addition to sene the delegation consisted of members of the 
un human rights commission from bulgaria colombia ireland 
nigeria and the philippines 
the group visited cuba sept 1626 on a mandate from the 
commission which last march accepted an invitation from castro to 
visit the island and investigate the human rights situation 
the invitation followed a twoyear effort by the united states 
to have cuba put on the commissions agenda 
the united states and international organizations including 
amnesty international have cited reports of human rights violations 
in cuba including torture and mistreatment of political prisoners 
cuba has denied the allegations 
the delegation will present its report to next years 
commission which opens in february sene said he declined to go 
into the groups conclusions 
in answer to a question sene said some cuban prisoners who met 
with the group said they had been threatened because of their wish 
to meet with the human rights delegates 
but sene said the cuban government had assued the delegation 
that all citizens could meet freely with the panel without fearing 
reprisals after the group left cuba 
sene said his group visited three prisons and a psychiatric 
hospital 
the group also met with castro and other cuban officials as 
well as private citizens church officials and nongovernmental 
organizations including the cuban human rights commission

olympics fans who were watching television 
friday night were exposed to the newest michael dukakis ad which 
suggested that republican rival george bush was wrapping himself in 
the american flag because he lacked a real issue with which to 
attract voters 
the 30second ad on nbc consisted of a group of actors posing as 
george bushs aides trying to plot out a campaign strategy 
entitled the packaging of george bush the ad begins with one 
of the aides mentioning democrat dukakis health insurance plan for 
the 37 million americans who lack coverage 
its going to go over real well with the middle class 
another voice says weve got enough problems with the middle 
class 
when one aide asks so what does bush do another answers 
wraps himself up in the american flag that again another 
asks get out the flag boys another says 
the ad concludes with the slogan theyd like to sell you the 
package wouldnt you rather choose a president 
the dukakis headquarters in boston refused earlier friday to 
supply a script and information on the ad

michael dukakis and george bush raided each others home states 
on friday dukakis accusing his republican rival of pursuing an 
agricultural policy of the fewer farmers the better and bush 
swooping into massachusetts to collect more endorsements from 
police who serve under the democrat 
dukakis told a farm rally in idalou a small community in bushs 
adopted state of texas that the vice president doesnt see the 
pain in rural america he vowed to devote 100 million for 
investment in rural areas if elected 
campaigning in texas at a time when polls show him trailing the 
democratic presidential candidate asserted that some 250000 farm 
families have left the land since bush became vice president in 
1981 
standing in front of a cattle pen on a dusty family farm 
dukakis claimed reagan administration farm policies had idled 
farmland and depressed farm prices 
my friends mr bushs farm policy can be summed up in just 
five words the fewer farmers the better the massachusetts 
governor said and his rural development policy can be summed up 
in two words tough luck 
dukakis also poked fun at bush whose legal texas residence is a 
hotel room in houston since i rented a hotel room in dallas last 
night i guess i qualify as a texan dukakis said 
dukakis received an unexpected newspaper endorsement as well 
the seattle times which almost always endorses republicans 
announced friday that it would carry an editorial sunday supporting 
dukakis 
the editorial said bush must share responsibility with president 
reagan for the potentially catastrophic federal deficit and 
the widening financial gap between the welloff whove gained 
handsomely and the tens of millions of middleclass and poor 
americans who are today relatively worse off 
the dukakis campaign also aired a new 30second ad friday night 
during nbcs coverage of the olympics the ad called the 
packaging of george bush showed actors portraying bush aides who 
say he must wrap himself in the american flag because he has no 
issue that appeals to the middle class 
 
 
 
 
and in an adver 
 
bush meanwhile made the second raid of dukakis home turf in a 
week to pick up police endorsements eight days after he won the 
backing of the boston police patrolmans association the vice 
president on friday made a hasty schedule change to accept the 
endorsement in springfield mass of two municipal police unions 
bush told them the massachusetts prison furlough program was a 
national disgrace 
speaking earlier in paterson nj where he also received 
police endorsements bush accused dukakis of having a revolving 
door program for murderers who have not even served enough time for 
parole 
the two references were to a favorite bush target a furlough 
program that allowed passes for firstdegree murderers the program 
was later amended but not until after one of the prisoners escaped 
while on furlough and raped a maryland woman 
dukakis supporters sought to counter bushs latest endorsements 
with a news conference in hartford conn where the hartford 
police union endorsed dukakis 
yet more national polls weighed in with tossup results a gallup 
survey of 1020 registered voters indicated bush was the choice of 
47 percent dukakis 42 percent the survey conducted tuesday and 
wednesday had a 3 percent margin of error 
a los angeles times poll conducted by calling back voters who 
had been interviewed just before and then just after the sundays 
presidential debate found the race still a tie at 4545 percent 
it had been 4646 sunday 
the new callback poll conducted thursday had 622 respondents 
and a fivepoint margin of error 
president reagan meanwhile took a cue from bushs attacks on 
dukakis for his membership in the american civil liberties union 
portraying the democratic contender as liberal liberal 
liberal 
speaking to an audience of 1200 at a polish social hall in 
southwest chicago the president suggested that dukakis 
performance in last sundays debate was just like an aclu member 
he didnt have a prayer when he needed one 
questioning the positions of the aclu reagan added you 
recall a few years back political figures had to disassociate 
themselves from groups on the right with farout views isnt it 
now time for responsible people to do the same thing with farout 
groups on the left 
just days before the nationallytelevised vice presidential 
debate in omaha neb sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said bushs 
record on education is as empty as dan quayles resume 
the democratic vice presidential made the comments in prepared 
remarks accepting the national education associations endorsement 
of the democratic ticket 
before heading to washington dc to claim the endorsement 
bentsen told a rally in charlotte nc that the democratic ticket 
stood for a strong national defense and was ready to pay the 
price to defend freedom 
quayle took time out from his debate preparation to travel to 
philadelphia for a fundraiser and firehouse exposition aides said 
he spent the morning in questionandanswer sessions with his staff 
and on saturday would hold a mock debate with sen bob packwood 
rore who is standing in for bentsen during the practice session 
david prosperi quayles spokesman said that session would be 
videotaped and reviewed over the weekend 
in his texas appearance dukakis criticized bush for hiring 
democrat zbigniew brzezinski as an adviser he contended that 
brzezinski who was president jimmy carters national security 
adviser was an architect of the 1980 grain embargo 
im not going to embargo grain and im not going to hire mr

have repeatedly tried to link the moderate opposition with the 
extreme left 
a coalition of 16 parties ranging from the centerright to the 
socialist left is campaigning for his defeat in the plebiscite

groups from its ranks

demagogism that feeds illusions poverty for thousands of 
chileans

the house ethics committee has decided theres 
no time this year to investigate allegations that rep wayne owens 
dutah allowed a utility company lobbyist to perform congressional 
duties in violation of house rules 
ethics panel chairman julian c dixon dcalif and ranking 
republican john t myers of indiana announced the decision in a 
letter wednesday to h craig moody the utah republican chairman 
who complained about owens the letter was released by owens on 
thursday 
owens said he welcomed the committee action but expressed 
regret they could not deal with the merits of the frivolous 
issue raised by the gop chairman 
moody complained to the committee aug 10 that owens allowed 
kenley brunsdale a utah power amp light co lobbyist to perform 
congressional staff duties in preparing a financing bill for the 
central utah water development project 
the complaint contended the work was illegal because brunsdale 
was receiving a salary from the utility moody said brunsdales 
work on the bill amounted to an inkind contribution from an 
outside entity which is prohibited under house rules 
the complaint was mailed hours after the interior committee 
approved the bill which boosted the water projects money for the 
198990 fiscal year by 452 million well under the 750 million 
owens originally sought 
dixon and myers wrote moody that his filing did not meet the 
requirements for complaints made by nonmembers of the house 
against house members 
noting the committee could undertake the investigation on its 
own the chairman and ranking member said there is not sufficient 
time to consider the matter in the waning days of the 100th 
congress 
however the committee may entertain taking up the matter in 
the next congress when there will be time to fully investigate and 
explore the issues said the two members of what is formally the 
committee on standards of official conduct 
owens called moodys complaint the thinnest attempted smear in 
the history of utah politics he termed it a meanspirited act 
of political desperation

no charges will be filed against two 
us olympic swimmers for the theft of a marble lions head from a 
hotel bar and they can return home now that they apologized for the 
prank a prosecutor said friday 
the case is now closed and they can leave the country 
senior prosecutor yoo sungsoo said 
yoo said he notified the us embassy that goldmedal winners 
troy dalbey and doug gjertsen and a third american ernest mangum 
can leave saturday 
the prosecutor said he decided not to charge the three americans 
because they wrote statements repenting for the action and 
apologized to the south korean people 
police said dalbey and mangum admitted removing the 830 carving 
from a seoul hotel saturday but that an investigation showed 
gjertsen was not involved authorities said dalbey and mangum who 
identified himself as a friend of the two swimmers were drunk when 
they pulled off the stunt 
it was not immediately clear why gjertsen apologized if he was 
not involved 
the case attracted nationwide attention hundreds of koreans 
called newspapers and police to demand the swimmers be punished and 
prevented from leaving the country 
the two swimmers said in a statement tuesday that they were 
being exuberant and the incident was a prank to celebrate their 
gold medal victories in two olympic events the previous day the 
two apologized and said they hoped the incident would not damage 
ussouth korean relations 
the two swimmers will keep their medals but us olympic 
officials kicked them off the team and said they were to be sent 
home as soon as they were cleared with police 
the incident received wide publicity because it took place at a 
time of growing antius sentiment among south koreans during the 
olympics incidents involving us athletes and news media touched 
off a wave of antiamericanism 
many south koreans are displeased by the disorderly conduct of 
us athletes during the opening ceremony of the olympic games nbc 
television also came under fire for its allegedly biased 
coverage of a boxing bout during which south korean sports 
officials attacked a referee

a judge dropped civil and contempt 
charges thursday against the impoverished city of east st louis 
and its mayor despite their inability to produce records explaining 
80000 in payments 
mayor carl e officer said he had gone overboard to try to 
explain why he received the money in addition to his annual 30000 
salary between 1984 and last year 
circuit judge robert craig agreed east st louis had made 
goodfaith efforts although many financial records were missing 
st clair county states attorney john baricevic who requested at 
a hearing that charges be dropped would not comment afterward 
about his motivation 
officers lawyer eric vickers of st louis said baricevic 
knows he didnt have a case against him vickers opposed 
dismissal of the lawsuit saying the mayor had been embarrassed 
publicly by the charges and deserved to be exonerated by a trial 
the mayor and his aides said many of the citys financial 
records were lost in a move about three years ago and in an arson 
fire in april 
the lawsuit over the 80000 was only one of many woes facing 
east st louis 
in the past year the citys bank accounts were frozen three 
times the latest on wednesday by the federal government which is 
seeking repayment of an environmental protection agency sewer grant 
allegedly misused 
another freeze expected to be lifted soon resulted from 
firefighters going to court to force payment of more than 82000 
owed them for five years of clothing allowances 
the city of 55000 people across the mississippi river from st 
louis had repeatedly failed to meet its payroll requiring an 
infusion of state money in june but the city has avoided seeking 
bankruptcy protection because that would allow a courtappointed 
trustee to make decisions now in the hands of elected officials 
officer meanwhile faces a federal inquiry into his campaign 
finances focusing on whether he failed to report the transfer of 
19000 in 1986 from pete fields an unsuccessful congressional 
candidate 
the mayor has denied breaking any laws and said he had no qualms 
about the investigation but he told city council members wednesday 
night that the epa judgment combined with a projected city deficit 
of nearly 500000 for the rest of the year will lead to more 
layoffs 
were going to have to cut and cut deep he said 
in april state prosecutors went to court to force the city to 
pick up garbage after cutbacks suspended regular pickups for six 
months 
one of the biggest financial setbacks for east st louis this 
year was a 4 million judgment won by a jail inmate who suffered 
brain damage when he was beaten by another prisoner officials said 
they didnt have the money to pay the award but the inmates 
attorney garnished the city operating funds

medicaid abortions and allows federal spending on medicaid 
abortions in cases of rape and incest ectopic pregnancies and 
when the mothers life is threatened

solidarity leader lech walesa said 
thursday he will be able to work with newly appointed prime 
minister mieczyslaw rakowski despite past differences 
i know his arguments and his way of thinking the leader of 
the banned trade union movement said speaking at a news conference 
on his 45th birthday 
walesa referred to the legal period of solidarity in 1981 when 
rakowski was deputy prime minister in charge of dealing with trade 
unions solidarity was banned in early 1982 
i always came to mr rakowski in those times with various 
problems and i always looked afterward at what i got and not at 
mr rakowski i have to admit i had no complaints about the work 
he said 
similarly now i am ready to solve all the problems that i am 
going to raise i have enough arguments all of europe and the 
world know them said walesa winner of the 1983 nobel peace 
prize 
parliament on tuesday overwhelmingly approved rakowski as the 
countrys ninth prime minister since world war ii 
the government led by zbigniew messner resigned sept 19 
following strong criticism of its failure to achieve reform 
in his speech to parliament rakowski asked for two weeks to 
form a government of people with reformatory attitudes and said 
he hoped to broaden the communistdominated government 
walesa said he could shed no light on exactly when planned 
roundtable talks with authorities slated for midoctober will 
begin authorities agreed to the talks on solidarity after a wave 
of strikes in august 
society is waiting for the roundtable talks that is 
evident walesa said 
he said solidarity would object if the talks were stretched out 
for too long 
we are not marathon runners he said 
in a statement issued thursday the warsaw branch of the club of 
catholic intelligentsia urged the roundtable to take decisions to 
change the form of public life in poland and called for 
legalization of solidarity 
the fulfillment of this postulate legalization of solidarity 
is the essential condition of actual reform of political and 
economic life the statement said 
club president andrzej stelmachowski has played a key role as an 
intermediary between the authorities and solidarity recently 
in london the opposition labor party on thursday accused 
british prime minister margaret thatcher of supreme hypocrisy 
in arranging to meet walesa oct 18 in gdansk at the end of a 
threeday official visit 
she is undermining the position of trades unions at home while 
appearing to encourage trades unionists in another country said

when he led the cia during the ford 
administration vice president george bush battled the justice 
department in an effort to restrict a criminal investigation of 
senior cia officials a published report said 
at the time a federal grand jury was investigating allegations 
that officials working for or with the cia including former cia 
director richard helms lied under oath to congress about cia 
operations in chile during the early 1970s 
information about the dispute between bush the justice 
department and the ford white house staff came from newly released 
files in the gerald r ford presidential library in ann arbor 
mich the los angeles times reported in its friday editions 
the files showed that in october 1976 citing the need to 
protect intelligence sources bush repeatedly sought to prevent 
some documents from being declassified and cia witnesses from being 
called before a federal grand jury 
when white house officials reminded bush that president ford had 
already given a public pledge that his administration would not use 
classification or any other means to prevent exposure of illegal 
activities bush balked according to the files 
an impasse exists between the justice department and director 
george bush of the cia white house counsel philip w buchen 
wrote to ford 
buchen told the president that if the justice department failed 
to obtain the disputed information it would abort the pending 
investigation and lead to no prosecution 
in a memo at the time to another white house official bush 
said there is no intention on my part or on the part of this 
agency to take any action that might reasonably be construed as an 
effort to thwart or frustrate the investigation being conducted by 
the justice department 
at the same time i mean to do whatever is necessary and 
appropriate to carry out my statutory mandate to protect 
intelligence sources and methods believing as i do that such 
protection is at the heart of the agencys ability to function 
effectively he said 
president ford instructed bush to let federal prosecutors have 
what they needed 
the justice department investigation eventually resulted in 
helms 1977 plea of no contest to two criminal charges of failing 
to testify fully completely and accurately to congress 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said through a spokeswoman 
he would withhold comment until seeing the documents spokesman 
mark goodin told the associated press late friday he could not 
comment until he had read the report

lloyd bentsen welcomed running mate michael 
dukakis back to texas on thursday and said if their radical 
right rivals win the white house well be living in the 19th 
century instead of the 20th century 
the texas senator introduced dukakis at a 12 million 
democratic party fundraiser in dallas after appearing with him to 
formally accept the endorsement of the combined law enforcement 
association of texas the states largest police organization 
at that gathering bentsen joked about republican presidential 
nominee george bushs claim to texas as his adopted home state 
bushs legal residence is a hotel suite in houston 
bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee asked 
presidential nominee dukakis if he had checked into their hotel yet 
and then deadpanned in some peoples mind that makes you a 
texan 
at the fundraiser bentsen said bush has been a partner in an 
administration that hurt texas by failing to adopt a national 
energy policy and attacked the vice president and other republicans 
for questioning the patriotism of dukakis whom he introduced as 
a patriot for massachusetts 
this election is about much more than waving the flag 
bentsen said the question is what are we going to do together to 
make us even prouder of our allegiance for the next four for the 
next eight and for the next 12 years from now when our children are 
ready to the future 
bentsen said dukakis would provide activist leadership from the 
oval office and in an apparent swipe at president reagan said 
that if he and dukakis are elected there will be no falling 
asleep at the switch while secondlevel aides run the show 
bentsen said he was eager to debate gop counterpart dan quayle 
next week and characterized the indiana senator as having a 
radicalright agenda out of the mainstream of american voters 
he doesnt even know what century he lives in bentsen said 
in a gibe at a recent gaffe in which quayle said he did not live in 
this century and believe me if they get their way well be 
living in the 19th century instead of the 20th century 
bentsen in recent days has been leading the counterattack to gop 
charges that dukakis is out of the mainstream by accusing bush of 
pandering to the archconservative wing of his party in selecting 
quayle as his running mate 
bentsen came to texas from nashville tenn where he visited a 
middle school to reiterate dukakis support for the nations space 
program and urge the students to consider becoming scientists and 
astronauts 
bentsen had planned to stay at the school and watch the launch 
on television with the schoolchildren but he left after liftoff 
was delayed 
sharing a small seat with his wife beryl ann and surrounded by 
staff and reporters bentsen watched the launch on television at 
the nashville airport before leaving the city for texas 
its a great morning he said as discovery soared into 
orbit it looks perfect 
at the school bentsen said the shuttle launch marks a new 
beginning in our space program 
it is a good beginning but there are more challenges ahead of 
us he said 
he told the students dukakis was committed to the shuttle 
program and to a permanently manned us space station dukakis 
also has promised to revive a cabinetlevel space council and to 
put bentsen in charge of it 
machines can go into space but really only people can explore 
space probing for its secrets and reaching for the stars 
bentsen said

discoverys astronauts having 
achieved the triumph of liftoff and the crucial business of 
satellite delivery settled into a workmanlike routine today with 
scientific experiments and time out for sightseeing and mozart 
the relatively quiet schedule contrasts with the tense drama of 
fire and thunder as they rocketed into orbit thursday and revived 
an american space program that had been devastated 32 months 
earlier by the explosion of challenger and the loss of its seven 
crew members 
we sure appreciate your all getting us up in orbit the way we 
should be discoverys commander frederick h hauck told 
mission control soon after he and his four crew members achieved 
orbit 184 miles above earth

lee remick has made a career of avoiding 
typecasting 
she was an alcoholic in the days of wine and roses a tough 
piano coach in the competition a suicidal actress in the tv 
movie haywire and winston churchills mother in the sevenpart 
television series jennie 
two seasons ago she was nominated for an emmy for her role as a 
woman who persuaded her son to kill her father in the factbased 
major nbc miniseries nutcracker money murder and madness 
her newest project is another aboutface the cbs movie 
jesse this tuesday its a small film with a simple story 
remick plays a dedicated nurse in a doctorless small town who is 
arrested for practicing medicine without a license 
remick who had flown to new york from her home in cape cod to 
help publicize the movie said she has spent recent years doing 
mostly television because thats where the diverse roles are 
i just look for the stuff that interests me and i dont like 
to repeat she said thats the nature of the biz once youve 
done something well they think ah thats what she does and 
they keep sending you the same script over and over again 
i havent been offered anything in a feature in a few years 
that has come close to giving me that kind of fertile ground to 
play with she said and thats why i try to find different 
stuff each one say nutcracker a couple of years ago to this 
which is just as polarized as they can possibly be 
jesse filmed in arizona is based on a true story in the 
1960s a woman was arrested for practicing medicine without a 
medical license even though the nearest doctor was more than 100 
miles away when she insists on having a jury trial rather than 
just paying a fine she has to cross two mountain ranges to reach 
the courthouse to her surprise and joy the entire town packs up 
and goes with her 
the movie was directed by glenn jordan who directed remick in 
the television movies the womens room and toughlove his 
promise starring james garner and james woods won an emmy two 
years ago 
i just think hes wonderful remick said it was he who 
brought the piece to me it appealed to us both i think for the 
same reasons because of the basic core of what its about the 
sort of frank capraesque quality of it of the little guy taking 
on the big government machine and winning i dont want to ennoble 
it too much but its about the strength of humanity of this woman 
as opposed to the cold inhumane aspect of the law that said she 
shouldnt help anybody under those circumstances 
to the letter of the law she was breaking it no question 
absolutely no question but its the law that was wrong in this 
case im certainly not an advocate of people going around breaking 
the law saying i know better but in this case she was way ahead 
of them 
remicks next project another cbs movie slated to air next 
year is a bridge to silence costarring marlee matlin who 
won an academy award for her role in children of a lesser god 
for matlin who is deaf the tv movie will be her first speaking 
role she and remick play a daughter and mother 
shes remarkable shes a wonderful actress remick said 
shes so open and kind of instinctive and free curious 
interesting experience which i had some concern about when i 
started i thought you know whats it going to be like for the two 
of us to communicate i do not have sign language at my beck and 
call but we did it was terrific 
the movie filmed in canada and directed by karen arthur was 
something of a first for remick too since she had never worked 
with a female director before 
interesting working with a woman she said not that its 
different in terms of her work shes doing the same thing as men 
do but ive just never been in that position directors have 
always been kind of father figures its interesting its 
wonderful shes terrific

the success of this summers bull durham 
has helped lead the way to an outpouring of movies about baseball 
once considered boxoffice poison by the moguls who ran the 
hollywood studios 
during its first month of release bull durham a funny 
sexy account of minorleague baseball starring kevin costner and 
susan sarandon scored 26 million in ticket sales in the united 
states and canada the orion release written and directed by 
former bush league player ron shelton has been followed by eight 
men out and stealing home 
eight men out john sayles drama about baseballs greatest 
scandal the sellout by members of the 1919 chicago white sox 
received a warm welcome from critics stars include charlie sheen 
db sweeney john cusack and christopher lloyd 
jodie foster won raves for her performance in stealing home 
the story of a minor league ballplayer seeking a comeback after 
years on the skids tvs mark harmon costars 
upcoming baseball movies include 
major league with charlie sheen and tom berenger as 
members of a hapless team who suddenly become winners rockystyle 
the scout anson williams directing rodney dangerfield as 
a baseball scout who uncovers a potential superstar it is filming 
this fall 
shoeless joe filming in dubuque iowa with kevin 
costner james earl jones amy madigan and burt lancaster 
according to writerdirector phil alden robinson it is not really 
a baseball movie 
based on a novel by wp kinsella it concerns a farmer 
costner who is told by a spirit that shoeless joe jackson of 
black sox fame will come back to life if he builds a diamond in a 
cornfield 
trading hearts already playing in a few regions a 
romance about a pitcher raul julia who is cut from spring 
training 
producer herb jaffe said trading hearts also is not a 
baseball picture 
thats a hangover from the longheld belief that baseball 
strikes out in theaters the arguments most often heard over the 
years are that baseball is incomprehensible to foreign audiences 
and that women who make up a large part of movie audiences will 
not want to see films about baseball 
thom mount producer of bull durham and part owner of the 
minor league durham nc bulls encountered such prejudice when 
he sought a releasing company 
five studios turned us down before orion picked up bull 
durham he said we were told simply that baseball pictures 
dont make money he attributed the films success to the appeal 
of costner 
also young women are impressed with the role susan sarandon 
plays a strong vital liberated character 
by attracting the female audience bull durham appears to 
have solved one of hollywoods prejudices it remains to be seen 
whether it can also appeal to foreign moviegoers there is hope in 
baseballcrazy japan and the game has been spreading to other 
countries as well given the reasonable cost 9 million bull 
durham is assured of a profit in the domestic market alone 
a survey of baseball movies over the years indicates that the 
studios antibaseball attitude may have been justified even the 
boxoffice luster of robert redford couldnt convert the 
allegorical the natural into a winner 
the bestremembered of baseball movies the pride of the 
yankees with gary cooper as lou gehrig was another commercial 
disappointment 
many other biographical films have failed to excite the 
moviegoing public especially women 
the winning team with ronald reagan as grover cleveland 
alexander the babe ruth story william bendix as the great 
bambino the stratton story james stewart as monty stratton 
who staged a comeback after losing a leg the pride of st 
louis dan dailey jr as dizzy dean the jackie robinson 
story in which the black pioneer in the major leagues played 
himself fear strikes out anthony perkins as jim piersall 
victim of mental illness 
baseball musicals have proved to be only middling hits damn 
yankees with tab hunter and gwen verdon take me out to the 
ballgame with gene kelly esther williams and frank sinatra the 
same with comedies alibi ike joe e brown rhubarb ray 
milland it happens every spring ray milland 
the difficulty of selling a baseball movie to the studios is 
illustrated with eight men out produced oddly enough by 
three women barbara boyle midge sanford and sara pillsbury a 
book about the white sox scandal was optioned in 1980 but the film 
was not made until this year 
we couldnt get a development deal anywhere pillsbury said 
the story had three strikes against it the subject was 
undeniably baseball it was an ensemble piece it was period and 
hence expensive we were told that baseball pictures had never been 
successful especially overseas 
the producers finally made a deal with orion pictures which 
also sponsored bull durham and the scout 
pillsbury thinks eight men out will appeal to women 
baseball is simply the arena that the story takes place in 
she said its more of a human story which is all the more 
exciting because it is true 
the scout also had a tortuous route to the screen the film 
actually went into production in 1982 with peter falk as star then 
was suspended earlier this year orion sent it to kathy 
lymberopoulos producer and associate of rodney dangerfield 
the story she said centers mainly on a baseball scouts life 
and less on the game itself as to any feminine prejudice against 
baseball she added i love baseball and so do a lot of women 
you look around a ballpark today and youll see about 
halfandhalf men and women 
what do the players themselves think of baseball movies heres 
lou johnson 53 star of the los angeles dodgers in the 1960s and 
now doing community service lecturing against alcohol and drug 
abuse 
ive liked some of them like the lou gehrig story roy 
campanella tv movie and jackie robinson bingo long and the 
natural but youre not going to get an accurate picture of 
baseball out of movies theres got to be a lot of fantasizing 
they give you what the public wants not what is real 
i especially liked bingo long because it was about the negro 
american league and i could identify with it it captured the 
particular social life and lifestyle that we all went through he

db sweeney approaches acting the way shoeless 
joe jackson played baseball just do it 
the best theory i ever heard about acting was from james 
cagney said sweeney 26 who plays jackson in john sayles 
eight men out the story of the 1919 chicago white sox scandal 
you walk in plant your feet stare the other fellow in the 
eyes and tell the truth all the acting theories ive heard all 
the books ive read you cant get it any simpler or purer than 
that 
eight men out tells the story of the biggest scandal in 
baseball the 1919 white sox were widely regarded as the best team 
of their time with such pitchers as ed cicotte and lefty williams 
and a lineup featuring future hall of famers eddie collins and ray 
schalk chicago won the american league pennant and were heavy 
favorites against the cincinnati reds in the world series 
no one however could play ball like jackson a lifetime 356 
hitter and outstanding left fielder once a mill worker in south 
carolina he had little education and could not read or write but 
was peerless on the field 
he was very passive sweeney noted he took the path of 
least resistance in everything he could everything he did was from 
a defensive mode except on the field where he attacks 
sweeney wanted to contrast jacksons athletic grace with his 
awkwardness in private life 
on the field i wanted him to be like ballet superstar 
mikhail baryshnikov i wanted every move he made to be 
beautiful sweeney said off the field i wanted him to be 
tentative 
players earned little money in jacksons era and were often 
tempted by gamblers to throw games eight members of the white sox 
including jackson agreed to or were aware of an effort to 
deliberately throw the series against cincinnati 
the reds won the series and the white sox poor play aroused 
widespread suspicion the following year commissioner kenesaw m 
landis permanently banned jackson and his seven teammates from 
baseball 
no one could ever prove that jackson who batted 375 in the 
world series ever tried to throw a game more likely he was 
punished for being aware of the fix and not trying to stop it 
they dont kick you out of the pentagon for knowing about 
fraud sweeney said adding that jackson who died in 1951 
should have his name cleared and be inducted into the baseball hall 
of fame 
daniel bernard sweeney was born and raised in shoreham ny he 
attended tulane university and hoped to play major league baseball 
until tearing ligaments in his right knee 
the injury convinced sweeney to pursue a career in acting and 
he transferred to the performing arts division of new york 
university after graduating in 1984 he appeared in the broadway 
revival of the caine mutiny 
he made his film debut in sidney lumets power and has 
since appeared in francis ford coppolas gardens of stone and 
no mans land 
although sweeney has not appeared on stage in two years he 
still prefers the working atmosphere of the theater 
on no mans land there were about four producers one 
director to start the film and one to end it we had five different 
writers and by the way we also have these actors he said 
in a play even if its a neil simon play on broadway its 
going to have to be about the actors or nobodys going to come i 
enjoy acting on stage better because there are less people with 
walkietalkies in your face 
sweeney felt an immediate rapport with sayles brother from 
another planet matewan and enjoyed working with him on the 
set 
we met in new york and talked for about an hour we talked 
about roberto clemente the late pittsburgh pirates star john 
likes the pirates hes a real bluecollar man those are the right 
reasons to like a baseball team he said 
i had access to john all the time we had a great 
relationship we would just check in with each other to gauge each 
others continued enthusiasm 
to prepare for the film sweeney traveled to kenosha wis and 
worked out with the local minor league team 
kenosha is a good town for jackson a real bluecollar town 
everybody there works for one of those corporations i think 
theres a similar ethic about work that jackson might have grown up 
with 
thats the world where jackson came from 
playing jackson boiled down to forgetting about everything 
except baseball 
i tried to stand there and clear my mind sweeney said he 
would just stand and take his three swings and more often than not 
hit it and hit it well in my daily life i have to deal with bank 
statements acting associates and friends and things its often 
like a juggling act

its so joe 
the baseball movie long relegated to hollywoods minor leagues 
is the winner of 1988s cinematic comeback of the year award from 
summer smash bull durham to critical rave eight men out 
baseball movies are back 
and so what if stealing home the mark harmonjodie foster 
entry in the baseball movie race was almost universally panned 
two out of three means hollywood is batting 667 this year 
the bounce back of baseball has prompted musings on the subject 
in the washington post the new york times and newsweek actor 
kevin costner delivered the most valuable performance in durham 
as veteran minor league catcher crash davis but an assortment of 
stars suited up this year mark harmon charlie sheen and db 
sweeney to name a few 
costner and sheen will do it again for movies coming out next 
year the switchhitting costner will appear in shoeless joe 
playing a farmer under the sway of black sox star joe jacksons 
ghost while sheen will be joined by la law star corbin 
bernsen in major league 
but why this return of the ballplayer as movie star after years 
without any horsehide hits 
the r rating gary cooper as lou gehrig who was married in 
pride of the yankees never enjoyed the offfield activities of 
durham bulls rookie righthander nuke laloosh and if susan sarandon 
had played mrs gehrig lou might have been the luckiest man on the 
face of the earth 
the popularity of baseball virtually everybody has played or 
watched the american pastime major league attendance increases 
every year in fact you can expect that announcement from 
outgoing commissioner peter ueberroth within weeks of the seasons 
finish this year 
the icandothat syndrome this factor is best described 
by national lampoon editor matty simmons any 5foot3 270pound 
slob can watch george bell blast a roger clemens 95mph fastball 
into northern quebec and say to himself i can do that why 
because baseball players look like human beings they look like 
they belong behind a 7eleven counter 
think about it cant you picture new york mets phenom gregg 
jefferies serving up a cold slurpee and a big gulp now try to 
imagine new york giants rookie jumbo elliot 6foot6 305 pounds 
doing the same thing 
as simmons points out elliot could be a 7eleven counter 
theres one more big reason the movies are better in the past 
most baseball movies focused on one player one star there was 
jimmy stewart as onelegged pitcher monty stratton and anthony 
psycho perkins as outfielder jimmy piersall or ronald reagan 
playing hurler grover cleveland alexander before his career really 
took off 
bull durham was the product of writerdirector ron shelton 
who spent five years kicking around the minor leagues in the 
baltimore orioles organization eight men out was done by john 
sayles a diehard baseball fan

in december 1985 when 248 
soldiers and eight crewmen died in a plane crash in gander 
newfoundland the remains were dug out of the ice and snow and 
transferred here to be identified and prepared for burial 
nearly 400 servicemen stationed at dover air force base 
volunteered to work around the clock at the gruesome task cleaning 
the building running errands putting together uniforms all to 
see that the bodies were returned to their families before 
christmas 
the long hours in which the tragic became the mundane inevitably 
led to a special kind of stress and that in turn led to a special 
kind of counseling at this base which serves as the us 
militarys morgue and mortuary 
the counseling program for the volunteers is called critical 
incident stress debriefing 
the debriefing process is basically designed to help normal 
people deal with exposure to overwhelming and traumatic events 
in terms of dealing with it personally emotionally and 
professionally said michael j robinson director of the base 
family support center 
what ended up happening robinson said recalling the 
aftermath of the gander crash was that early on probably about 
four days into the operation people began to notice that people 
were having a lot of trouble coping dealing functioning 
and a lot of the behavior we saw people dealing with were 
situations that you find in battle fatiguelike situations combat 
stress situations 
it wasnt the first time for dover air force base 
inside the main door of the mortuary is a simple wooden plaque 
headed significant events listing numbers and faraway place 
names that evoke memories of flagdraped coffins 
the places gander jonestown vietnam the persian gulf are 
reminders of the thousands of dead us servicemen and the 
civilians whose remains have come home through the base 
a nondescript 30000squarefoot building houses the largest 
mortuary operated by the armed services 
its really the largest mortuary in the country said 
charles carson a civilian government employee who started in the 
funeral business in 1950 and who has been in charge of the facility 
for 17 years 
the mortuary can handle up to 100 bodies per day and there is 
storage space for up to 1000 the average workload is 55 to 60 
bodies per month but the average workload is not what the mortuary 
is noted for 
war disasters and terrorist acts the significant events 
have sent 23722 bodies through the mortuary 21693 of them during 
the vietnam war 
the jonestown guyana catastrophe where followers of cult 
leader jim jones committed suicide resulted in 913 deaths in 
november 1978 
the base received the remains of the seven astronauts from the 
space shuttle challenger 
when a major tragedy occurs there is an outpouring of 
volunteers from among the ranks of servicemen stationed at dover 
as in the case of the gander crash the troops on this base they 
really rallied to this thing they really wanted to help carson 
said 
before the remains arrive carson briefs volunteers in an effort 
to determine how they perceive death and whether they have 
hangups about dead bodies 
nearly 200 volunteers were on hand when the bodies of 237 us 
servicemen were returned from beirut lebanon victims of the 
terrorist bombing of a marine barracks in october 1983 
as is most often the case the bodies from beirut were 
identified and embalmed before arriving at dover they were given 
cosmetic work and dressed for burial 
gander was significant because the remains came directly from 
the crash site robinson said 
volunteers working 10 to 14 hours at a stretch were exposed 
to some things the average person has a great deal of trouble 
dealing with 
there were some people who had real physical discomfort 
people who were nauseous we had some people who were coping 
extremely well able to do the job and keep going robinson said 
to help alleviate the stress a mass debriefing was held and 
psychological counseling was offered 
since the gander disaster the defense department and all 
branches of the military have begun to explore the implications of 
the exposure to and the handling of dead bodies 
robinson and four others at the base have taken training courses 
designed mainly to help firefighters police officers and emergency 
medical personnel learn to cope with the intimacy with death that 
they find in their jobs robinson hopes to have at least eight or 
nine people trained at all times 
during the gander disaster base personnel reacted intuitively 
and from knowledge of post traumatic stress disorder robinson 
said adding that officials learned ways to shelter people from 
some of the factors that would increase the likelihood of showing 
longterm effects from post traumatic stress disorder 
during a stress debriefing he said small groups discuss what 
they experienced what it was like for them what was the 
hardest part about that because what we know is that if someone 
talks about exposure to that type of event the likelihood of them 
ending up with longterm post traumatic stress disorder symptoms is 
going to be markedly decreased 
according to robinson volunteers time in the mortuary will be 
reduced in the future once you go past the third and into the 
fourth day you can predict a lot of the things that are going to 
be happening to people emotionally and physically in terms of 
wearing down he said 
as groups are rotated in and out they will probably be debriefed 
and given two days off before being allowed to return 
we know what we need to know now robinson said

comrades and i expropriated 1066002 from the sunset branch of 
the hibernia bank casualties could have been avoided had the 
persons involved kept out of the way and cooperated with the 
peoples forces patty hearst april 1974

the newspaper heiress sat smiling in a posh 
manhattan hotel suite answering questions about her past as an 
urban guerrilla and her present status as a suburban housewife 
the whole business gets stirred up every five or 10 years 
anyway patricia hearst shaw said as she sipped a glass of 
mineral water and then six months from now theyll have 
forgotten what i look like again and that will be that 
whats stirring up things now is paul schraders patty 
hearst based on her recently rereleased book patty hearst 
her own story which tells the story of her 1974 san francisco 
kidnapping by the symbionese liberation army 
hearsts two daughters lydia 3 and gillian 7 will see 
actress natasha richardson posing as mommy hold a rifle while 
robbing a california bank 
it was something i knew would be done she said of the 
movie and so when producer marvin worth came and said he 
wanted to use the book and make a film i thought well this is 
kind of my best chance if its going to happen its going to 
happen 
besides hearst said one of her two daughters already knows the 
tale of tania the name given to her by sla head donald defreeze 
also known as field marshal cinque he and five other sla members 
died in a shootout with police three months after the kidnapping 
my eldest does only because she came home from the bus one day 
and asked about it someone on the bus had told her about it she 
said she wasnt that interested in it you know 
she was kind of shocked that it had really happened she 
couldnt believe it and shes never said anything about it again 
hearst is the daughter of william a hearst chairman of the 
board of the hearst corp which owns an assortment of newspapers 
radio stations magazines and television stations across the 
country her grandfather william randolph hearst was the subject 
of orson welles acclaimed film citizen kane 
the kidnapping was more a matter of expediency than anything 
else her name had been in the newspaper announcing her engagement 
to steven weed along with the fact she was attending university of 
california at berkeley the kidnappers pulled a card with her 
address from a public file at school 
they never did ask for ransom hearst said im really 
hardpressed to say what they the sla were thinking about they 
were saying well we would have kidnapped your father except he 
was so much more heavily protected and i thought oh please 
its the same as everybody else they kidnap or injure women and 
children because its easier i dont know what politically their 
goal was supposed to be 
as a gesture of good faith on behalf of his daughter hearst 
established a 2 million program called people in need which 
distributed food to the needy throughout california the sla 
leaders never responded to the program initially they demanded 
that 70 worth of food go to every needy person in the state 
patricia hearst has had her familys support throughout 
i was surprised because with the sla they were busy 
convincing me that not only had my family abandoned me they would 
never want to see me again she said 
she maintained in the interview as she has all along that she 
was brainwashed and totally under the sway of the sla because of 
its mental and physical torture of her 
the abduction was frontpage news the subsequent events two 
bank robberies one slaying 19 months on the run rumors the whole 
thing was staged her arrest trial conviction and presidential 
pardon seemed almost like a movie as they occurred 
if you werent reading about me you were reading about the 
watergate hearings or someone else going to prison or being 
indicted said hearst who appeared on the cover of newsweek 
seven times in two years i guess it just fit right in there with 
all the other political drama that was taking place at the time 
she was arrested in september 1975 convicted of participating 
in the bank robbery and received a sevenyear prison sentence 
president carter pardoned her in 1979 she married bernard shaw 
her former bodyguard and they have been living in westport conn 
for the past four years 
hearst wasnt involved in the making of the movie although she 
did meet once with richardson and she has viewed the finished 
product did it bring back bad memories 
yes and no she said its really so different for me to 
try and look at it as an objective observer so i havent really 
spent any time thinking how does this make me feel its more like 
what am i seeing up there 
hearst has changed dramatically from the 21yearold who raised 
a clenched fist for photographers after her arrest by the fbi who 
listed her occupation as urban guerrilla who was labeled a 
common criminal by us attorney general william saxbe 
now 34 she lives quietly with her husband and children 
occasionally returning to san francisco for such events as the 
opening of the opera season 
the flashbacks that plagued her after the kidnapping violent 
dreams where she would kill sla comrades bill and emily harris 
are gone she giggles nervously about the events of the past 
although she acknowledges that discussing them can be disquieting 
i dont like it much hearst said 
and shes hopeful the release of the movie can be the final 
chapter in the hearst case 
to those who remain skeptical about her story she says i 
think the movie is like reading my book and saying theres still 
questions that arent answered well i guess only if you cant 
stand what you read if you wanted to hear something else

director paul schrader believes a good movie 
should make good dinner conversation 
and maybe thats the goal of this movie not to solve the 
case said schrader of his latest project the film patty 
hearst 
while tidy endings abound elsewhere patty hearst stops just 
where it starts atop a stack of questions with few explanations 
about why a kidnapped heiress became a selfproclaimed urban 
guerrilla final conclusions about guilt or innocence as schrader 
sees it should be made back at home over roast beef mashed 
potatoes and buttered green beans 
such ambiguity marks a change of course for the filmmaker when 
writing taxi driver raging bull and the last temptation 
of christ schrader dealt with visceral emotions with patty 
hearst he has made a movie whose loudest voice is ambivalence 
but that he thinks is what daily decisions are sometimes 
about movies offer us problems but life offers us dilemmas 
he said in an interview its always easier watching movies 
because there is a problem and they get rid of the problem 
schraders career like that of any demanding filmmaker has 
been marked by both triumphs and spills even those who didnt see 
robert de niro in 1976s taxi driver can quote schraders 
dialogue verbatim you talkin to me but who remembers 1987s 
light of day 
he also did an erotic remake of cat people in 1981 starring 
nastassja kinski malcolm mcdowell and john heard 
a michigan native he graduated from the university of 
california at los angeles film school and lives in new york with 
his wife actress mary beth hurt since he began work in 1974 by 
writing the screenplay for sidney pollacks the yakuza about 
japanese gangsters schrader has been drawn repeatedly to colorful 
and controversial figures 
i didnt really know the answer to the hearst dilemma 
before he said and i still dont that was one of the things 
i had to accept in making the film the answer to did she or 
didnt she is yes and no you try to present that mystery to the 
audience but when i tried to weigh the argument to one side or the 
other i found that it rang false yes she was turned into a 
political revolutionary no that wasnt patty hearst for every 
statement there is an equally valid counterstatement 
when hearst told her story in the book every secret thing 
she said the symbionese liberation army brainwashed her during her 
1974 ordeal schraders movie while adapted by nicholas kazan from 
the book takes a slightly different tack patty hearst 
balances the scales suggesting that hearst may have made a choice 
in her own destiny 
it looked interesting from the outside kidnapping bank 
robbery shootout but then you got in it and you say wait 
theres no story schrader said you can imagine that if she 
had died in watts during the shootout that killed six sla members 
what the mythology machine would have made of her she would have 
been tania the grand revolutonary hero 
but there are some massive limits here the story is 
dramatically deficient you care about people who do things 
this girl doesnt do anything she doesnt act she is acted upon 
it runs against the commercial essence of cinema 
to make patty hearst as compelling as possible schrader 
spun out a visually inventive narrative it sticks to the facts 
but with odd camera angles cyclical music and eerie gothic sets 
he cast british actress natasha richardson daughter of vanessa 
redgrave in the title role 
if i did a docudrama it would just lie there he said 
this called for a hand of authorship i am telling her story and 
i have to acknowledge that the first pronoun in that sentence is as 
important as the second 
odd though it may sound there are similarities between hearst 
and some of schraders earlier protagonists 
in a way shes a socially marginable character too 
schrader said and ive always enjoyed taking a point of view of 
someone whos sort of on the margins of society a psychopathic 
cab driver taxi driver a homosexual suicidal novelist 
mishima the boxer jake lamotta raging bull jesus the 
last temptation and say lets take their point of view lets 
see the world as they see it 
one of the things that the movie sort of says at the end is 
here we have this empty vessel who everyone turns into a symbol 
for their own purposes and at the end of the movie she says 
look i hate to disappoint you but im just me and im not that 
interesting

triumph like time can heal all 
wounds 
powered by redesigned booster rockets urged skyward by the 
hopes and tears of a nervous nation discovery took america back to 
the last frontier thursday 
on paper its mission was simple test the new features of the 
shuttle and deploy a communications satellite 
but in the hearts of millions discovery headed for the heavens 
to erase the vision of explosion frozen for 32 months to expunge 
the haywire contrails that blotted the florida sky to place in the 
past the public deaths of the challenger seven 
this does not mean there are not terrible scars left by 
challenger but they are no longer wounds said former astronaut 
joe allen now an executive at a local aerospace company 
ive always marveled at the resiliency of humans we are 
creatures that throughout history have been beset by challenge and 
tragedy and for whatever reason able to grieve and pick ourselves 
up allen said 
said jane smith widow of challenger astronaut michael smith 
we feel like we are all in a sense flying with them 
but back on earth the uncertainty for americas space program 
is far from over nasas abilities and safety efforts are still 
scrutinized since the freespending apollo days the agency has 
had persistent problems getting money from congress some members 
of which now question the expense of a space station nasas next 
goal which is at least eight years away 
nasas woes mounted as the soviet union was setting records for 
space duration when the five discovery astronauts reached orbit 
thursday three cosmonauts were already there aboard the mir space 
station two of them more than halfway through a mission planned to 
last a year 
it will take some time to catch up if the united states hopes 
to send men to mars for example nasa must learn much more about 
the effects of long duration in space astronauts say 
most observers say the united states still has the lead in space 
technology but the soviets perhaps to underscore that they are 
closing the gap released the first photos of its space orbiter a 
shuttle lookalike about 90 minutes before discoverys glorious 
liftoff 
still the roar of thursdays launch and the shuttle programs 
rediscovery of space turned the questions to cheers across the 
country 
when this mission is on the ground all these other milestones 
become real goals said astronaut linda godwin who has been with 
nasa three years and is not yet scheduled to fly this step had 
to be accomplished everything is contingent on when we get back 
flying i think its a turning point in a sense that challenger is 
no longer our last flight 
now we have new memories for a while all we had was 
challenger 
for nasa the last 32 months have been an emotional and 
technological rollercoaster 
those seeking the causes of the challenger explosion found that 
the fault was not just the failure of an oring seal but also a 
failure of communications within nasa warnings of oring troubles 
were ignored or not relayed to launch officials 
while grounded nasa went through a complete shakeup all the 
way from top officials down to engineers and astronauts who left to 
work elsewhere 
redesigning the shuttles booster rockets and then getting them 
approved for flight took longer than many within nasa had hoped 
morale sank even lower 
in many ways its a thankless task at this time of personal 
tragedy and low morale youve still got a mountain of work to 
do said allen whos still closely involved with people and 
projects here at the johnson space center you have to tip your 
hat to the nasa worker that went through that 
astronauts launched themselves into higher positions in the 
agency assuming administrative and oversight roles not enjoyed 
since the early days of the space program they sat in on meetings 
they had not been invited to before and training continued on 
missions slated for the next decade 
but it wasnt until this summer that morale started to climb 
officials said 
even the last week it the launch seemed remote because of 
bad weather and another leak godwin said then we started 
seeing things happen in preparation for the launch that we hadnt 
seen before in the last 2 years 
as thursdays countdown progressed the emotional mix here was 
as volatile as the fuel in the giant orange external fuel tank 
some of the astronauts gathered in the same room where they had 
viewed the challenger launch 
there was a lot of tension it was a long two minutes you 
cant help but compare said godwin challenger could have been 
any crew i dont think anybody can be strapped in there on top of 
that rocket and those boosters and not realize what youre sitting 
on top of but we get through life thinking its not going to be 
me 
as discovery lifted off and cheers erupted all around the 
johnson space center the flight directors in mission control held 
back nary a sound until 2 minutes 4 seconds into flight when 
discovery shed its solid rocket boosters safely and applause broke 
out 
nasa back in the saddle contained its glee within the 
statement discovery performance nominal space parlance for 
no problems 
with discoverys nominal performance and landing scheduled for 
monday the talk has shifted even beyond the next shuttle flight 
astronauts are already training in a mockup of a space station 
shuttle missions are mapped out to 1992 the talk has turned back 
to a space competition with the soviets never actually was there 
doubt that america would not explore space 
we went to space originally out of a sense of competition 
allen said i do believe the challenge of space is certainly 
inherently great enough to challenge any particular country that 
has some confidence in its destiny and even if there was a single 
country on the planet people would still go into space 
wherever discovery leads us it surely leads us out of our 
challenger mourning even for some relatives of the lost crew 
discovery may mark a final pickingup of the pieces 
i hope for the challenger crew for my husband that today 
brought him a greater peace lorna onizuka widow of mission 
specialist ellison onizuka said here after the launch 
the triumph of discovery may bring a sense of peace to the 
nation as well the fiery explosion caused the most public deaths 
for america since the assassination of president john f kennedy 
and as the discovery launch repeated the sequence that led to that 
moment of horror many watching cried tears of joy tears of fear 
the spaceship cleared the launch tower and headed toward the 
stars about 70 seconds into flight mission control radioed 
discovery go at throttle up a repeat of the final words sent 
to the challenger crew 
the words were so so familiar 
roger go exclaimed commander rick hauck

british publisher robert maxwell has turned up 
the heat in the battle for macmillan inc by taking a sweetened 
bid that values the publishing and information company at 251 
billion directly to shareholders 
minutes before the stock market closed thursday maxwell boosted 
his cash tender offer to 9025 a share from 8680 in the latest 
assault in a fourmonthold takeover battle 
traders had little chance to react to the fresh bid which 
topped a cashandstock offer macmillans board had accepted from 
the buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co earlier in the week 
macmillan agreed to be acquired by kohlberg in a cash and 
securities deal the firm valued at 9005 a share 
maxwell alternatively offered 900 million for four prize 
divisions that macmillan had promised to sell to kohlberg for 865 
million in the event the firm was unsuccessful in acquiring the 
company as a whole 
such socalled lockup agreements generally are used to 
discourage rival bidders 
the businesses include macmillans direct marketing group its 
directory division which publishes whos who and other 
directories the berlitz language schools and michie co which 
publishes state legal codes 
in a dear ned letter to edward p evans macmillans 
chairman and chief executive maxwell noted we have said from the 
beginning we are desirous of purchasing macmillan inc in its 
entirety 
failing that maxwell offered to terminate the tender offer if 
he could have the four divisions which he dubbed macmillans 
crown jewels 
if shareholders warm to maxwells offer the british publisher 
could gain a controlling stake in macmillan without the boards 
approval 
macmillan had no comment on maxwells revised tender offer 
which will expire oct 13 unless extended 
earlier in the week maxwell proposed acquiring the company for 
89 a share in a negotiated transaction and said he asked macmillan 
representatives for an opportunity to top any bid the company 
received

maxwell has sharply criticized the true value of the kohlberg 
offer contending that members of the financial community said 
the package is worth less than 89 a share 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange macmillan 
rose 25 cents to close at 8887 a share 
maxwell head of maxwell communication corp had asked 
macmillan to conduct a fair auction but his lawyers have charged 
that the bidding process has been rigged 
maxwell said his latest offer was less conditional than the 
kolhberg offer because it was not subject to financing whereas 
the kohlberg offer contains a broad financing condition 
attorneys for the robert m bass group which controls 92 
percent of macmillan and sparked the bidding war for the company 
four months ago also challenged macmillans lockup agreement with 
kohlberg in court on wednesday 
bass filed a motion to intervene in a case maxwell has against 
the company and charged macmillan directors had breached their 
fiduciary duty by granting the lockup 
the bass group initially offered to acquire macmillan for 64 a 
share but backed out when the stock price began to rise steeply 
in midseptember the macmillan board approved kohlbergs 
initial 85ashare proposal but withdrew its backing last week 
after maxwell raised his offer to 8680 a share from 80

newspaper executives say theyre willing to 
change newsprint suppliers or seek overseas paper sources in 
response to another boost in north american newsprint prices which 
they claim is unjustified 
their reaction follows reports that major canadian newsprint 
makers which supply most us newspapers are raising their prices 
to 695 a metric ton from 650 on jan 1 
bowater inc the largest us newsprint producer was the 
latest to notify customers on thursday 
this is the dumbest time in five years that i can think of to 
raise prices and thats why i think people will resist it said 
one executive of a large us newspaper concern who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the threat of not renewing contracts is 
big 
newspaper executives say demand for newsprint is down 
dramatically due largely to a fall in retail advertising and the 
planned 69 percent increase therefore is not warranted they also 
say a buildup in newsprint inventories will enable them to cut 
orders for higherpriced paper 
canadian companies which provide about 56 percent of the 
newsprint used in the united states say they need the increase 
because the effects of last januarys 66 percent rise were erased 
by a decline in the us dollar they also say their raw material 
costs have risen 
weve told our suppliers that if they proceed in the amount 
and timing that theyve announced that we will take whatever 
methods and effort we have to take in order not to buy newsprint 
from them now or in the future said homer taylor vice president 
of supply at knightridder inc one of the nations biggest 
newspaper groups 
other media companies representing hundreds of daily 
newspapers also said they plan to fight the increase 
newsprint prices have risen approximately 288 percent since 
1970 when a metric ton cost 179 prices are up more than 21 
percent in the last three years alone 
newsprint accounts for the largest portion of the industrys 
costs behind labor it can range anywhere between 13 percent of 
total publishing costs for smaller newspapers to about 25 percent 
for larger dailies wall street analysts estimate 
newspapers say their profits are being squeezed by the higher 
newsprint costs combined with weakness in advertising which 
provides the bulk of newspapers revenue 
john houghton president of quebec amp ontario paper co which 
also has announced a price increase disputed the argument that 
demand for newsprint was weak 
this is the best balance weve had since 1981 in terms of 
supply and demand he said 
houghton argued that while retail advertising was not as strong 
as in the past its already at a good level 
the newspaper advertising bureau said advertising including 
retail national and classified ads was up only 3 percent in the 
first quarter from a year earlier retail advertising was up just 1 
percent 
the american newspaper publishers association meanwhile said 
newsprint usage declined the past five months in august 
consumption was down 47 percent compared with a year ago mainly 
because there was one less sunday without the sunday difference 
consumption was down 17 percent in august 
eric philo an analyst with the investment firm goldman sachs amp 
co said he did not foresee much improvement in demand well into 
1989 aside from the normal pickup in the fourth quarter for 
christmas advertising 
revenue wont pick up and demand wont start growing more than 
it has in the next several months he said 
newspaper executives said they could fight the price increase by 
going to suppliers who would give them discounts and better prices 
including overseas to japan italy or scandinavian countries who 
also make newsprint 
some analysts said newspapers might be in the position at least 
to postpone the increase until later next year 
if they have significant inventories built they wont be 
forced to go on ordering from the higherpriced companies they can 
get tonnage from other sources at a lower price said linda 
lieberman an analyst with mabon nugent amp co 
analysts say with newsprint inventories are higher than normal 
and capacity expanding by about 5 percent next year newspapers may 
be able to put off the price increases at least for awhile

a proposed 25 billion merger of lucky and 
alpha beta supermarket chains has been blocked by a federal judge 
who maintained the deal would kill competition and severely hurt 
consumers 
in issuing a preliminary injunction thursday us district 
judge david kenyon ruled the proposed merger of two companies that 
are among the 10 largest grocery chains in the united states 
appears to violate the clayton antitrust act by lessening 
competition 
kenyons order contained in a 27page opinion focusing on 
supermarket competition data in california freezes the merger 
until a trial can be held on the antitrust issues no date has been 
set for a trial 
this court finds that unless defendants are enjoined the 
citizens of california will be substantially and irreparably 
harmed said kenyon 
california attorney general john van de kamp sued to bar the 
acquisition of lucky stores inc by american stores co the 
irvinebased nationwide grocery and drugstore company that owns 
alpha beta van de kamp said the merger would kill competition and 
thus drive up prices at the checkout stand 
american stores in a news release vowed to appeal the decision 
van de kamp said he was pleased with the judges ruling but 
cautioned that this is only an initial victory 
but for now the consumers are protected he said 
lawyers for american stores argued the merger would benefit 
consumers and allow price cutting through a more efficient joint 
operation 
they also contended american was unfairly harmed being by a 
delay in its acquisition of lucky which is based in dublin 
calif and has markets in several states they said van de kamps 
suit was too late to stop a virtually completed business deal 
lucky agreed in may to the 25 billion buyout by american 
american with 1600 supermarkets and drugstores nationwide rivals 
kroger co of cincinnati as the nations biggest market chain 
the judge disagreed with americans contention that the merger 
was a done deal 
while the court in no way belittles the harm defendants may 
suffer as a result of this preliminary injunction he wrote 
the court concludes that it is substantially less than the harm 
plaintiffs would suffer if the merger is not enjoined 
the preliminary injunction issued by kenyon forbids any further 
action on the merger until the merits of the case are aired in 
court 
kenyon said he considered the alpha betalucky plans in light of 
the recent purchase of 172 safeway markets in southern california 
by the vons supermarket chain 
after the two combinations vons will have 350 stores and 
luckyalpha beta would have 550 
the attorney general also opposed the vons deal but 
negotiations produced an agreement in principle to settle that 
disute mary mcaboy spokeswoman for the vons cos said thursday 
she refused to reveal details of the agreement 
both sides in the alpha betalucky case presented statistics on 
how the planned merger would affect grocery buyers 
van de kamp said californians would have a 400 million annual 
increase in grocery bills if both combinations took place american 
stores insisted its proposal would cut prices by 50 million a year 
both the alpha betalucky deal and the vonssafeway purchases 
were approved by the federal trade commission which analyzes such 
combinations for possible harm to competition to preserve 
competition the ftc ordered vons to sell 12 stores and american to 
sell 37 
in the case of american stores the ftcs decision was tentative 
and a hold separate agreement was in effect 
kenyon said such an agreement requires the independent operation 
of both chains until the merger is final 
the judge rejected an argument by american stores attorney frank 
rothman who contended the merger was complete and the egg has 
already been scrambled 
if the court is to make a determination as to whether this 
merger is anticompetitive said kenyon the state is correct in 
its assertion that the egg must be examined before it becomes an 
omelette

japan said that foreign access to the countrys 
tightly restricted rice market should be discussed at a 
multilateral forum rather than just between the united states and 
japan according to reports friday 
prime minister noboru takeshita sent a letter to president 
reagan urging that the issue be discussed at the uruguay round of 
trade talks under the general agreement on tariffs and trade a 
world trade body the japan broadcasting corp reported 
and the foreign ministry said that japanese ambassador nobuo 
matsunaga met with secretary of state george shultz in washington 
to express concern about the rice issue 
matsunaga said us demands that japans market be opened to 
foreign rice were not simply a question of procedures under the 
us trade act but rather a political issue of extreme gravity 
affecting the basis of japanus relations the ministry said 
in september the us rice millers association filed a 
complaint with the office of the us trade representative 
demanding access to japans rice market matsunaga asked shultz to 
promptly dismiss the petition the ministry said 
japan maintains it should be allowed to maintain 
selfsufficiency in rice because of its status as a basic foodstuff

the government said today its chief 
forecasting gauge of future economic activity rose a moderate 04 
percent in august 
the commerce departments index of leading economic indicators 
may be a signal that robust growth and the inflation that goes 
with it may require another dose of higher interest rates from the 
federal reserve board 
but analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions from a 
single months figures the index is designed to predict economic 
activity six to nine months in advance and economists say it takes 
three months of reports to establish a clear trend 
in july todays report said the index dropped 06 percent 
after shooting up 15 percent in june the best in 18 months the 
july dip had earlier been calculated at 08 percent and the june 
gain at 14 percent 
the august index report is another piece of evidence indicating 
that some analysts may have been premature in reading signs of a 
slowdown in august 
five of the available nine components of the index contributed 
to the increase four detracted from it 
the biggest boosts came from a drop in average weekly claims for 
state unemployment benefits from 325000 in july to 298000 in 
august a rise in orders for manufactured consumer goods from 
852 billion to 893 billion last month also was a big plus 
together these two categories accounted for twothirds of the 
positive activity also adding to the overall increase were rises 
in plant and equipment orders in building permits and in the price 
of raw materials which is read as a sign of strong demand 
indicators making a negative contribution in order of severity 
were a decrease in business delivery times read as an indication 
of slackening demand a drop in the average workweek a decline in 
the standard amp poors index of 500 stocks and a contraction of the 
money supply in inflationadjusted dollars 
the 04 percent overall increase left the index at 1934 percent 
of its 1967 base of 100 
the august rise was a bit bigger than most analysts were 
expecting most looked for only a slight increase or for the index 
to remain flat 
in the last week economists have been reconsidering an earlier 
judgment that this years robust growth was beginning a welcome 
cooling in august many now read signs of slowness as indicating a 
pause in growth rather than the start of a trend 
the august unemployment survey the first report hailed as a 
sign of a slowdown jumped from 54 percent of the work force to 
56 percent retail sales and growth in personal income were also 
sluggish 
other analysts werent so sure pointing to continued strength 
in manufacturing of big ticket durable goods and evidence that 
the employment report may have been an aberration 
some analysts argue that the drop in jobless claims numbers 
could indicate the unemployment rate increase was a fluke caused 
in part by difficulty in adjusting the statistic for seasonal 
factors and in part by temporary factory layoffs caused by unusual 
heat and power brownouts 
people will come to realize that any slowdown will be minor at 
best and wont be enough to take off price pressures said paul 
denoon an economist with manufacturers hanover 
lyle gramley chief economist of the mortgage bankers 
association of america and a former federal reserve board member 
said the two sectors that have been driving the economy export 
sales and spending by businesses to modernize and expand remain 
solid 
i dont see any evidence that either of those two engines are 
slowing down to a more moderate pace he said and unless more 
evidence emerges to confirm a slowdown the fed will be forced to 
push interest rates higher although probably not until after the 
election he said 
the leading index since its creation in 1948 has correctly 
predicted all eight recessions however it also has falsely 
predicted a recession four times 
also preliminary estimates of the index are often revised 
substantially in later months for instance declines were 
initially reported for five straight months from september 1987 
through january later revisions wiped out all but two of the 
drops in november and january 
the index last declined for three consecutive months from june 
through august 1984 the economic expansion slowed but there was 
no contraction

the month down from 648 billion in july and 540 billion in

the house passed the pentagon spending bill 
today as congress and president reagan hoping their electionyear 
budget truce holds resumed their race against the clock to 
complete work on the governments 1989 spending business 
the house approved the 282 billion defense bill on a 32777 
vote and senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said he 
believed it was likely lawmakers would finish work on all five 
remaining appropriations bills in time for tonights midnight 
deadline 
it shows what can happen when the president and congress 
cooperate he said 
if all 13 appropriations bills needed to keep federal agencies 
running for the fiscal year that starts saturday are enacted before 
the clock strikes 12 it will mark the first ontime budget 
performance since 1948 
were all goggleeyed about that said rep joe skeen 
rnm ranking republican on the house appropriations committees 
treasury subcommittee 
reagan so far has signed six of the 13 measures and two others 
are sitting on his desk 
the house passed three more appropriations bills thursday a 
466 billion agriculture measure a 143 billion foreign aid 
bill and a 18 billion measure for congress own operating 
expenses the senate planned to take up the three today 
congress planned to try to finish the two remaining pieces of 
spending legislation today as well 
one providing 32 billion for the district of columbia was 
awaiting resolution of a dispute over whether the city could use 
federal aid or its own revenues to pay for abortions 
congressional leaders took up the defense spending bill after 
learning that reagan had signed a separate measure passed 
wednesday providing spending authority for pentagon programs 
lawmakers had expected the only potentially controversial issue 
to be aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
the current program of humanitarian aid to the contras expires 
today and the bill contains an amendment proposing new aid 
the amendment written by democratic leaders in both chambers 
provides 27 million in new nonlethal aid it also proposes 165 
million worth of military aid including weapons 
but the plan provides that the military aid cannot be released 
to the contras unless the central american peace process fails and 
until there is a new vote of both chambers to release the aid 
it was possible that even if there were no serious disagreements 
on the bills the midnight deadline might not be achieved simply 
because of the time it could take for congress to pass five 
separate measures 
reagan and congressional leaders worked all year to avoid a 
repeat of last years 600 billion catchall measure that covered 
all government agencies the enormous bill resulted from a year in 
which reagan and lawmakers fought constantly over taxes and 
spending priorities 
this years work was eased by last novembers budget summit 
agreement between the two sides in which broad spending targets 
were set 
congressional leaders began warning lawmakers on thursday that 
they might have to work over the weekend if they did not complete 
the spending measures 
failure to enact the remaining appropriations bills would have 
little immediate effect because few government employees work over 
the weekend agencies for whom financing has not been provided 
would have to close their doors on monday although essential 
workers such as the military would continue working anyway 
under government regulations

crude oil futures plummeted to their lowest 
level in more than two years today as more negative news from opec 
sent the market into a frenzy 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for november 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude hit 
a low of 1325 a barrel at midday 
the last time the nearmonth contract closed below that level 
was on aug 1 1986 when it reached 1155 a barrel prices had 
fallen below 14 a barrel several times in recent weeks but 
rebounded before trading sessions ended 
the story is a complete breakdown in opecs discipline said 
peter beutel an oil analyst with elders futures inc 
the november crude contract dropped 19 cents thursday to settle 
at 1392 that was the lowest settlement price for a nearmonth 
contract since 1373 price of oct 29 1986 
analysts said statements from opec secretary general subroto 
that saudi arabia was increasing its oil output sent the market 
into a frenzy 
subrotos acknowledgement that world oil prices probably would 
be weak for the longterm indicated the unlikelihood that 
discipline would be restored anytime soon analysts said 
saudi arabia the largest producer in the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries has taken the lead in the past in 
bringing other members back to their assigned quotas 
saudi arabia is said to have recently joined the united arab 
emirates kuwait and iraq in exceeding their quota leading to 
speculation that the saudis are trying a new strategy to force opec 
members to rein in oil production 
but subroto said in an interview that the move could send prices 
into a tailspin to as low as 5 a barrel if the saudis used their 
available capacity 
in other trading thursday prices for refined oil products rose 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery closed up 025 
cent at 4642 cents a gallon other contract months were lower 
october heating oil rose 004 cent to 3954 cents a gallon and 
other monthly contracts also advanced 
analysts said the gains in gasoline stemmed from the recent 
hurricane threat in the gulf of mexico when refineries and oil rigs 
halted operations 
api statistics released tuesday showed that although gasoline 
inventories were up 22 million barrels on a weekly basis to 219 
million barrels they were 10 million barrels below the same period 
a year earlier 
brokers said crude prices continued deteriorating reflecting 
investor concern over the surplus of oil on world markets 
its a continuation of the same old junk weve seen for the 
last four weeks said bud degorgue a trader with drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
analysts have said there is an excess of more than 1 million 
barrels a day of oil on world markets recent meetings of members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries have not 
resulted in any concrete steps to restrain output pushing prices 
lower

in vetoing the textile protection bill president 
reagan might have reopened one of the most divisive and emotional 
issues between liberals and conservatives 
the issue is bound to play a major role in the presidential 
debates because it is one that interests almost everyone oddly it 
is also one on which many people seem unable to make up their minds 
one side believes religiously that to protect textiles is to 
protect jobs the other believes it costs jobs one side believes 
protection is a prop to the american economy the other says it 
costs every american dearly 
it is a regional issue as well since many of the textile jobs 
that would be protected by import limitations are in the south but 
there is another side of the job picture it might cost jobs in the 
north and elsewhere 
the bill vetoed by the president would have further limited 
textile apparel and footwear imports already strongly protected 
in fact it is sometimes said that no other country has a bigger 
tariff wall 
the issue is loaded with misconceptions the very largest of 
them being one held over for decades including the 1930s when the 
textile industry was indeed in trouble but it is far less troubled 
today 
edward l hudgins of the heritage foundation a 
conservativeoriented think tank that often takes a probusiness 
position recently issued a paper stating that the american 
textile and apparel industry clearly is an industry that doesnt 
need help 
the industry he states is working at near maximum capacity 
95 percent compared with the mid80s for all domestic 
manufacturing it is using more wool cotton and manmade fibers 
than ever before employment is up 21000 new jobs were added last 
year textile profits are up as well so are exports 
lets keep it that way say those who view a healthy textile 
industry as necessary for certain regional economies times were 
not always good in fact they say they were dismal until 
protection put the industry on its feet 
perhaps say the freetraders but consider the cost hudgins 
says american consumers pay between 25 billion and 30 billion 
annually in higher prices due to these restrictions 
in addition there may be a cost to nontextile areas in jobs 
nancy oliver policy analyst at citizens for a sound economy 
another conservative think tank contends that textile 
protectionism costs more jobs than it saves 
the legislation just vetoed she says would have protected 
fewer than 46700 textile apparel and footwear jobs but would 
have destroyed more than 52400 retailing jobs that depend on 
imports 
she estimates the protection price tag for each of these 46700 
jobs could be as much as 262000 a year a figure so enormous it 
provokes comparison with the 17000 average annual pay scale for 
each job a bad bargain she suggests 
such arguments however may be ignored when the debate is 
graphically and personally described a job lost anywhere and 
jobs are lost in areas where textile companies falter is an 
upsetting experience for other americans 
a feeling of patriotism also enters the debate especially when 
americans sense they are being exploited by lowwage foreign 
manufacturers a feeling of brotherhood exists not just on the 
part of workers but employers too 
high as the cost might be therefore it is conceivable that 
many americans might be willing to pay the price of protectionism 
so long as the dollar total remains obscured by other parts of the 
debate

negotiators for caterpillar inc and the 
united auto workers union today agreed to extend their contract 
indefinitely while barganing continued toward a new pact avoiding 
a midnight strike deadline officials said 
the move will keep some 17500 caterpillar workers in five 
states on the job while negotiations continue 
a midnight strike deadline still loomed for farm equipment maker 
deere amp co which is negotiating with the uaw on a new labor pact 
near the companys moline ill headquarters 
the caterpillar extension came less than 12 hours before the 
current labor agreement was to expire and follows two months of 
unsuccessful negotiations between the union and caterpillar 
worlds largest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment and the 
union 
the decision to extend the negotiations puts on hold strike 
plans by the companys bluecollar workforce in factories in 12 
cities in illinois iowa pennsylvania colorado and tennessee 
each side must give five days notice if they wish to terminate 
the agreement said bill price assistant to the bargaining 
committee chairman for uaw local 974 which represents 10033 
caterpillar workers in peoria 
we just found out price said it couldnt have been more 
than 15 minutes ago 
main union objectives included merit pay increases for the first 
time in a decade 100 percent job security a reduction in overtime 
and callback of 1000 laidoff uaw members 
the union reportedly was seeking a 3year pact and a 3 percent 
wage increase in each year of the agreement 
caterpillar officials have taken a position of holding down 
costs and in past talks sought more flexibility in job assignments 
and scheduling as well as a more simplified grievance procedure 
and new guidelines for overtime 
the company wants to restrict employee mobility saving money on 
retraining and getting more productivity out of its workforce 
on thursday uaw officials at deere plants in iowa reported an 
unusual amount of overtime and double shifts recently as deere the 
leading manufacturer of farm tractors and agricultural implements 
struggled to meet backorders in the face of a possible strike 
our people have had a lot of overtime said jerry niedert 
vice president for uaw local 838 in waterloo iowa there has 
been overtime in all areas its excessive 
weve got people working 16 hours a day double shifts some 
guys are working seven days a week were talking lots of people 
hundreds 
niedert said the 5300 union workers at five deere plants in 
waterloo are ready to walk out if a new work agreement isnt 
reached when the contract expires 
karl mantyla uaw spokesman in detroit said the union is not 
interested in extending deeres labor contract 
larry solomon of local 751 in decatur ill said he also favors 
no extension 
if we let them drag their feet now theyre just going to keep 
on dragging their feet solomon said who knows when well get 
an agreement 
brian alm a deere spokesman rejected niederts contention that 
the overtime was designed to build company inventories in the event 
of a walkout he said a settlement is expected before the deadline 
weve been selling everything we can get our hands on alm 
said in some areas weve got a backorder situation 
the uawdeere talks affect about 13400 active employees and 
4000 laidoff workers at 11 cities in illinois iowa minnesota 
colorado and georgia deere employs about 38000 employees 
worldwide 
uaw officials have been meeting with deere since aug 11 at a 
negotiating site a few miles from the companys world headquarters 
in moline 
deere workers want to restore salary cuts suffered in their 1987 
contract they also want 100 percent job security and pension 
improvements 
as the caterpillar talks continued workers in peoriaarea shops 
read about the talks in a special negotiations extra newsletter 
in the publication tony green president of the peoriaarea 
local which represents about 10000 employees warned his troops to 
be ready to walk out if no settlement is achieved 
dated sept 21 the letter instructs union members of their duty 
to strike how to collect strike pay and other issues 
if a strike occurs believe me it will not be the fault of 
the uaw but caterpillar incs fault green said in a signed 
column 
another column by john hankins of the bargaining committee 
portrayed the uawcaterpillar talks as terse exchanges 
the company sets there and says i hear you not interested 
hankins said 
meanwhile negotiators continued to study the latest offer from 
caterpillar which company spokesman mark polzin described as a 
significant modification of earlier offers 
uaw spokesman jack roberts said the union spent much of the day 
writing a counterproposal which was presented to the company in an 
evening meeting

grand metropolitan plc said friday it was selling 
its intercontinental hotel chain to seibu saison group of japan 
for 227 billion in cash in one of the largest foreign 
acquisitions by a japanese company 
both companies also agreed to explore joint ventures in areas 
such as retailing food and real estate 
grand met said the intercontinental sale will give it an 
aftertax profit of 500 million pounds or around 845 million 
most of which will be used for future acquisitons it bought the 
100hotel chain from pan american airways in 1981 for 500 million 
intercontinental based in montvale nj runs hotels in 47 
countries among its bestknown properties are the recently 
refurbished willard in washington the mark hopkins in san 
francisco the mayfair in london and the carlton in cannes france 
grand met chairman allan sheppard said the sale provides grand 
metropolitan with a major opportunity to pursue its foods drinks 
and retailing strategies into the 1990s a plan outlined in a 
recently announced restructuring 
the company currently is embroiled in a contested bid for irish 
distillers group plc irelands leading whisky maker for which 
grand met has offered around 465 million 
grand met the worlds largest spirits company makes smirnoff 
vodka and j amp b scotch and has interests in food and retailing in 
addition to hotels its other businesses include alpo petfood and 
pearle vision centers annual sales total about 10 billion 
seibu saison has interests in real estate leisure hotels 
restaurants and food manufacturing it has annual sales of about 
20 billion 
japanese companies have taken advantage of the strength of 
japans economy and the japanese yen in recent years to emerge as 
big buyers of foreign companies and real estate 
the intercontinental deal marks one of the largest japanese 
acquisitions outside of japan heading that list is bridgestone 
corps 26 billion acquisition of firestone tire amp rubber co 
earlier this year and sony corps 2 billion purchase of cbs 
records in 1987 
this is an important and logical step in the 
internationalization of our hotel and other group interests said 
tatsuo aoki a seibu saison director access to grand 
metropolitans wide interests in many sectors and our own retail 
strengths in japan form the basis of an excellent alliance 
a grand met spokesman said joint ventures with seibu saison 
gives the london company an entree into japan in those areas 
were interested in 
grand mets major presence in japan is now in spirits one 
possible area of cooperation could involve franchising of grand 
mets food and liquor brands through seibu saison groups 
substantial retail outlets the spokesman said 
jonathan goble an analyst at the london investment firm 
barclays de zoete wedd ltd said their objective is to expand 
their presence in branded consumer nondurable businesses

a federal inspection of 35 commuter airlines 
has produced nearly a dozen cases of records being falsified and 
problems with managing maintenance and operations 
the special inspections by the federal aviation administration 
were announced last march and covered about 20 percent of the 
commuter airline industry which last year carried more than 31 
million passengers 
it was prompted by concern over a spate of commuter aircraft 
accidents in which 56 people were killed during a fourmonth period 
in late l987 and early 1988 
a report on the inspections is scheduled to be completed by 
december but faa officials provided a broad description of the 
findings at a congressional hearing earlier this week and in 
interviews thursday 
according to the agency of the 35 commuter carriers inspected 
one airline air new orleans has voluntarily surrendered its 
operating license and another which was not identified may be 
forced to shut down 
the faa said six other airlines voluntarily turned in their 
operating certificates as commuter carriers before an faa 
inspection of their operations could get under way although two of 
them denied the report 
the faa identified the airlines as arctic circle air avair 
dade helicopter jet exec express texas national air and grand 
canyon airlines 
the agency on thursday had said a seventh carrier south pacific 
island airways also had surrendered its commuter operating license 
but faa spokesman fred farrar said today that upon further checking 
it had been determined that the airline had not done so and 
continues to operate commuter flights in american samoa 
meanwhile texas national denied that it had relinquished its 
commuter license but farrar said faa records show the airline had 
surrendered its certificate that had allowed it to provide 
scheduled commuter service although he said the airline continues 
to provide ondemand air taxi service 
brian loflin corporate communications director for fairchild 
aircraft corp of san antonio texas said today that subsidiary 
texas national got out of the commuter business in august but did 
not surrender its certificate and continues as a charter service 
glenn schaab president of avair said that airline surrendered 
its certificate to the faa in june but the action had absolutely 
nothing to do with the impending faa inspection of the 
financially struggling carrier 
we had sold the flight operations portion of the company 
and didnt need the certificate anymore schaab said in a 
telephone interview from raleigh nc 
a sightseeing aircraft belonging to grand canyon airlines 
collided with a helicopter over the grand canyon in june 1986 
resulting in 25 deaths it was not clear whether grand canyons 
surrender of its commuter certificate affects its sightseeing 
operation 
the faa said at least three of the carriers avair dade 
helicopter jet and south pacific island already had been under 
chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in which a company seeks court 
protection from its creditors until it can develop a plan to get 
its finances in order 
avair last year carried 351522 passengers and was the 30th 
largest commuter in the country according to a ranking by the 
regional airline association 
none of the other airlines subject to the inspections was 
identified 
commuter airlines which normally fly aircraft of 30 seats or 
fewer have taken on an increasingly important role in air travel 
since many of the larger airlines no longer fly into small 
communities 
in testimony before a house investigations subcommittee on 
wednesday faa officials said as many as 200 enforcement actions 
may come out of the inspections of the 35 airlines 
john s kern acting deputy associate administrator for 
regulations and certification told the panel that in some cases 
irregularities were immediately corrected by the airlines and in 
some instances enforcement actions have been initiated 
kern provided no details as to the infractions found at the 
commuter airlines but described the findings in broad terms 
saying a detailed report was expected to be available by december 
he said the inspections focused on management maintenance 
quality control procedures and record keeping because preliminary 
studies indicated those to be likely problem areas

a federal appeals court today upheld eastern 
airlines decision to lay off about 3000 employees when it 
eliminated service to 14 cities ruling that an injunction against 
the furloughs was illegal 
the ruling by the us circuit court of appeals here struck down 
a decision last month by a lower court judge who had barred the 
financially troubled airline from carrying out the layoffs 
the threejudge panel ruled unanimously that the layoffs were 
not an unlawful change in working conditions under the railway 
labor act which controls labor relations in the airline industry 
the court also concluded that the dispute between eastern and 
the unions was a minor one under the railway labor act 
accordingly the district court was without jurisdiction to enter a 
preliminary status quo injunction under section 6 of the act 
the threejudge panel rejected the unions contention that the 
layoffs were part of an illegal campaign by easterns parent texas 
air corp to undercut the power of organized labor at the 
financially troubled carrier 
the unions have directed our attention to nothing that would 
undermine easterns claim that legitimate business concerns provide 
an ample reason for these reductions the court said 
the judges noted there is not a claim that eastern has 
tailored its reductions so as to impose a differential impact on 
union members indeed it appears that the furloughs affect union 
members and nonmembers in roughly their propotions of easterns 
workforce 
there was no immediate comment from eastern or representatives 
of the three unions that brought the suit 
us district judge barrington parker last month allowed eastern 
to stop service to 14 cities and close its kansas city hub but he 
barred the carrier from proceeding with the layoffs without 
negotiating the cuts with its unions 
the appeals court had stayed parkers order and allowed eastern 
to furlough the employees provided it post a 47 million bond to 
cover a months pay in case the unions prevailed 
the financially troubled airline which was purchased in 1986 by 
texas air corp had contended that it had not violated federal 
labor law provisions that it maintain current working conditions 
when it announced the layoffs in july 
the company cited a previous layoff since 1980 as evidence of a 
pattern of lawful furloughs 
but three unions the international association of machinists 
and aerospace workers the air line pilots association and the 
transport workers union of america contended that layoffs were 
part of a unionbusting campaign orchestrated by texas airs 
chairman frank lorenzo 
the company contended that in order for it to survive it needed 
the freedom to exercise legitimate business judgments such as 
deciding to go ahead with the layoffs 
the elimination of service to 14 cities is part of easterns 
attempt to streamline its operations and concentrate on its most 
profitable routes along the east coast and to latin america 
the airline contends the service cuts will result in annual 
savings of 50 million in operating and 7 million payroll expenses 
service was eliminated to albuquerque nm fort de france

at an average perroom price of 613000 room 
service not included the sale of the posh intercontinental chain 
is just the latest in a series of deluxe hotel properties to be 
snapped up at top dollar 
the purchaser japans seibu saison group is in fine company 
last year the sultan of brunei paid 757000 a room for his name 
to appear on the deed to the beverly hills hotel affectionately 
dubbed the pink palace by the polo crowd and real estate 
developer donald trump added new yorks french renaissancestyle 
plaza hotel to his glitzy empire for an average 495000 a room 
earlier this year 
the prices seem preposterous to industry observers 
its just off the chart said joseph j doyle a senior vice 
president at the investment firm smith barney harris upham amp co 
referring to the 227 billion that seibu will pay in cash for 
the 100hotel intercontinental chain 
doyle estimated the chain will make just 90 million this year 
putting the sale price at an astronomical 25 times net income a 
more reasonable multiple would be 10 or 18 times net doyle said 
the chains occupancy rate is unimpressively average at about 70 
percent and while its flagship hotels namely the recently 
refurbished willard in washington san franciscos mark hopkins 
and the mayfair in london are unmistakably luxurious doyle said 
most others in the chain cater more to the businessman than the 
carriage trade 
what may be most attractive about the chain is that it is 
international in scope 
theres a scarcity of luxury international hotel chains in 
general and those that do exist are seldom offered for sale 
said thomas mcconnell a manager of the hotel consulting group at 
the accounting firm laventhol amp horwath 
investors who purchase a chain buy into a wellrounded business 
with wide expansion possibilities while those like trump who buy 
single hotels are far more limited in what they can do to develop 
the operation 
but if buyers are unhappy hotels generally are easy to sell 
when allegis corp announced last year it would sell its westin 
hotel chain which included the plaza buyers from around the 
world rushed to make bids 
the chain went to aoki corp of japan and the robert m bass 
group of texas for 2 billion allegis also sold its hilton 
international chain to britains ladbroke group plc for 107 
billion 
also enhancing their value toptier hotels are almost certain 
to sit on valuable real estate which is destined to appreciate 
over time 
another longerterm dimension that buyers may be looking 
toward is if the world should get back to a high inflationary 
environment these hotels would be a hedge their earnings would 
grow rapidly doyle said 
but perhaps most important is the intangible aura of status that 
comes with owning a luxury hotel these buyers want trophies 
doyle said 
indeed mcconnell said theres a lot of panache to owning a 
hotel you can put your name on it you can bring your friends 
there you can live there 
to underscore the interest people have in the industry 
mcconnell noted that there is even a tv show about a hotel you 
dont see a tv show called malls he said 
whether a hotel is profitable depends on its occupancy rate and 
its average room price few properties make money on the food they 
serve no matter how pricey 
luxury hotels whose rates typically start at 200 a night in 
major cities have the benefit of a high degree of repeat 
customers people are willing to pay a luxury rate because they 
want to see a certain level of service over and over again 
mcconnell said

prices unleashed trader fears that interest rates would fall in the 
united states

lower inflation gold traditionally bought as a hedge against 
inflation was quoted at 394 a troy ounce at republic national 
bank in new york at 4 pm edt down from 39650 late thursday 
oil futures tumbled after the secretarygeneral of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries subroto said crude 
prices could plunge to 5 a barrel if saudi arabia switches to full

opec members who violate their export quotas that all producers 
would lose if they did not honor their opec output ceilings

contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude 
dropped 55 cents to close at 1337 a 42gallon barrel

output by the saudis the worlds largest oil producer raised the 
possibility of a collapse in prices 
the low oil prices dominated the market today said ronald 
holzer chief dealer at harris trust amp co in chicago 
oil prices are a barometer of inflation lower inflation usually 
leads to lower interest rates which is a bearish sign for the 
dollar 
overseas dealers also attributed the dollars slide to comments 
about the us currency by federal reserve board governor martha 
seger she said a sharp rise in the dollar would put the brakes on 
us economic expansion

spurred a dollar selloff late in the european trading day

by rekindled inflation 
the treasurys key 30year bond jumped 750 per 1000 in face 
amount its yield which moves in the opposite direction plunged 
to 898 percent from 906 percent late thursday 
oil prices fell through the 14abarrel level thursday for the 
first time in more than two years and weakened further friday with 
the nearterm contract closing at 1337 on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
lower energy prices could translate into lower inflation which 
makes fixedincome investments such as bonds more valuable

said

session trading was fairly active 
analysts said government reports that showed a rise in a key 
economic forecasting gauge and home sales in august possible signs 
of a strengthening economy had no impact on the credit markets 
the economic indicators were exactly where everybody estimated 
theyd be said anthony naylor a senior vice president at rodman 
amp renshaw inc 
analysts said some money managers may have been realigning their 
porfolios over the past week to show a more conservative bent for 
the third quarter hence they may have been purchasing bonds 
before the quarter drew to a close friday 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose point to 732 point intermediate 
maturities rose 732 point to 1532 point and longterm issues

oneyear bills eased to 811 percent and the discount fell 4 basis 
points to 755 percent

gold futures prices declined slightly friday on new yorks 
commodity exchange but analysts said the gold market displayed 
unexpected strength in the face of the oil markets collapse to new 
twoyear lows 
on other markets livestock and meat futures were mostly higher 
grains and soybeans were mixed and stockindex futures retreated 
precious metals prices usually follow the oil market closely 
metals traders consider the price of crude oil a good inflation 
barometer and gold is considered a good investment hedge against 
rising prices 
but fridays plunge in oil prices created only a moderate stir 
in the precious metals markets where sharp declines have been 
expected daily since gold slipped below 400 a troy ounce last week 
instead of plunging along with oil gold futures settled only 
240 to 310 lower indicating the metals market is stronger than 
it appeared to be a week ago 
had it not been for oil the precious metals might have tried 
to hold their own today said george anagnos metals analyst with 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
he said the most recent economic statistics including fridays 
report of a moderate 04 percent rise in the leading economic 
indicators indicate inflation may not be as tightly constrained as 
many believe 
james steel metals analyst with refco inc in new york said 
strong buying surfaced in the active december gold contract at 400 
early in the session gold for delivery in december rallied to 
40320 before the oil market collapsed and pulled it down to an 
ending price of 39920 
the spot october gold contract settled at 39440

co in new york said he expected december gold to close above 400 
early next week 
silver settled 4 cents to 51 cents lower with december at 
6225 a troy ounce 
oil prices fell in a selling frenzy sparked by reports that opec 
secretary general subroto had said saudi arabia was increasing its 
oil output 
subroto said the move could send crudeoil prices which already 
have been severely pressured by opec overproduction to as low as 
5 a barrel 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 61 cents 
lower with november at 1337 a barrel heating oil was 128 cents

of the agriculture departments quarterly hogsandpigs report 
which was released after the close and is expected to spark heavy 
selling on monday 
the reports tally of hogs and pigs in the 10 largest 
porkproducing states was close to prereport estimates but the 
market was surprised by the largerthanexpected number of pigs 
that producers expect to be born from sept 1 of this year through 
february 1989 
most traders had expected hog farmers to scale back their 
farrowing intentions because of the drought resulting in smaller 
supplies of slaughterready hogs next spring and summer analysts 
said 
live cattle settled 08 cent lower to 65 cent higher with 
october at 7175 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent to 105 
cents higher with october at 8245 cents a pound hogs were 30

frozen pork bellies were 117 cents to the limit 2 cents higher 
with february at 5232 cents a pound

finished mixed on the chicago board of trade in cautious trading 
ahead of the agriculture departments report on us grain stocks 
the report issued after the close showed soybean stocks as of 
sept 1 at 302 million bushels down from 655 million in the june 
report and 436 million a year ago the figure was well above most 
prereport estimates and traders pronounced it slightly bearish for 
soybean prices 
the usda estimated sept 1 corn stocks at 426 billion bushels 
down from 583 billion on june 1 and 488 billion a year ago 
wheat stocks as of sept 1 were estimated at 224 billion 
bushels compared with 127 billion in june and 296 billion a year

lawyers for drexel burnham lambert inc filed an 
extraordinary appeal late friday seeking disqualification of the 
judge hearing the federal governments huge fraud case against the 
wall street firm 
their petition to the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
reflected the aggressive approach that drexels defense team has 
taken in fighting the securities and exchange commissions sweeping 
allegations since they were announced sept 7 
the defense attorneys asked the appellate court to order us 
district judge milton pollack to disqualify himself on grounds that 
his wife has a financial interest in a company with business ties 
to drexel 
they said in the appeal this raises a conflict of interest 
requiring his immediate recusal recusal is a legal term meaning 
disqualification on grounds of prejudice 
while the position of pollacks wife might appear to bias the 
judge in drexels favor defense lawyers could fear that if he 
issued a ruling beneficial to them it could be overturned by a 
higher court 
other attorneys however said privately they believed the 
defense move actually was aimed at provoking pollack into anger and 
thereby forcing the judge to disqualify himself anyway the 
81yearold jurist is known for his nononsense approach and strict 
rulings in securitiesfraud cases 
the drexel appeal was extraordinary because no substantive 
issues have even been decided in the case appeals courts usually 
do not intervene in lower court proceedings until a decision is 
rendered 
pollack has scheduled his own hearing oct 11 on earlier defense 
requests for him to step aside because of his wifes financial 
interest in the drexelfinanced company palais royal of houston 
inc 
the judge was out of town friday and unavailable for comment on 
drexels appeal his secretary said since the appeal was filed 
late in the day it was unclear how or when the higher court would 
respond to it 
earlier friday lawyers familiar with the pretrial legal 
maneuvering said the drexel defense also was seeking to not only 
oust pollack from the sec case but from related suits as well 
they have now expanded the recusal warfare to include not 
merely the sec suit but all the class actions filed and 
consolidated said david berger one of the main lawyers 
representing groups that have sued drexel theyre trying to get 
rid of one of the most respected judges in the united states 
thomas curnin a leading drexel attorney in the case confirmed 
the defense team had undertaken to remove pollack from all related 
litigation but would not elaborate 
pollack was assigned the secdrexel case because he had been 
hearing other civil suits in which defendants include drexel and 
ivan f boesky the nowjailed speculator who turned states 
evidence and implicated the firm in a litany of fraud allegations 
that range from insider trading to cheating clients drexel has 
denied the allegations 
curnin also confirmed reports friday that the sec had requested 
documents and other materials from drexel concerning securities 
besides the 19 mentioned in the enforcement agencys original 
allegations 
the secs requests also include information concerning any 
surveillance or other investigation of boesky undertaken by drexel 
curnin said 
asked if the sec move represented a possible broadening of the 
case against the firm curnin said he did not believe so but said 
it may be designed to achieve the same results 
many lawyers familiar with the secdrexel fight say they think 
the government has leaked sensitive details about the investigation 
as part of an effort to pressure the firm and other defendants into 
settlement negotiations 
the sec and the us attorneys office which is widely known to 
be conducting a grand jury investigation into drexel activities 
have denied they are the sources of any leaks

zenith electronics corp sued thursday 
to block an investment groups attempt to wage a battle for control 
of the company and contended the group only was interested in 
boosting the price of its stock 
the company filed a federal lawsuit in chicago to prohibit the 
group brookhurst partners from waging a proxy fight against 
zenith management until it completely and accurately complied with 
federal disclosure requirements and from disseminating documents 
relating to any offer to buy zenith 
the suit also seeks a declaration that zenith may refuse to 
recognize the results of any proxy vote or any purchases of its 
stock by brookhurst until 30 days after the defendants comply with 
federal disclosure requirements 
brookhurst which controls 61 percent of zeniths stock and is 
the companys biggest shareholder is attempting to wage a proxy 
fight to force the sale of zenith the last us maker of 
televisions 
the partnership on thursday filed a motion in delaware chancery 
court seeking the elimination of zenith bylaws that restrict the 
rights of stockholders to act by written consent 
the motion also seeks the elimination of zeniths stockholder 
rights plan a socalled poison pill designed to deter hostile 
takeovers by diluting the value of a companys holdings 
the stockholder rights plan gives zenith the right to exercise 
its takeover defense if any one shareholder gains written consent 
from 15 percent of the shares 
brookhurst also wants copies of the zeniths shareholder lists 
and financial records 
a hearing is scheduled for oct 5 in chancery court concerning 
the shareholder lists 
brookhurst filed the motion in state court one day after a 
federal judge dismissed the groups federal suit which contained 
similar complaints on jurisdictional grounds 
brookhurst is seeking shareholder consent to trim zeniths board 
from 10 directors to six and to fill three of those seats with 
nominees committed to selling zenith 
zeniths lawsuit claimed brookhurst partners had deliberately 
conveyed the false impression that they are planning to acquire 
or broker the acquisition of zenith or some portion of its 
business 
zenith contends brookhurst actually seeks to artificially 
inflate the price of zeniths stock by creating the impression that 
zenith is in play so members of the group can sell their 
shares at a quick profit 
brookhurst said in a statement that zeniths lawsuit was 
groundless and reiterated its call for zeniths management to 
detail its plans for returning the battered company to profitablity 
unless zenith reveals such a plan the dissidents said they 
would continue their drive to sell the company

caterpillar inc and the united auto workers 
agreed friday to extend their contract indefinitely averting a 
midnight strike while negotiations continued at deere amp co 
struggling to beat the same deadline 
the extension agreement between peoriabased caterpillar and the 
uaw came just 12 hours before the current contract would have 
expired possibly triggering a walkout by 17500 bluecollar 
caterpillar workers in five states 
the negotiations were recessed with no time set for a resumption 
but at deere the possibility remained for a strike by 13400 
workers at midnight cdt as negotiations continued near the 
companys headquarters in moline ill 
were continuing to talk as planned said robert combs a 
deere spokesman were meeting right now im sure theyll 
continue to meet through the day i think its significant that 
talks picked up right away this morning 
elliott anderson a chief uaw negotiator in the caterpillar 
talks said the union decided to concentrate its efforts on deere 
and would likely use a settlement with deere as a pattern for 
future talks with caterpillar 
at both deere and caterpillar job security increases in pay 
and pensions a reduction in overtime and a callback of laidoff 
workers were at issue neither the union nor the companies would 
reveal their specific contract proposals 
a deere walkout would affect 13400 factory workers in 11 cities 
in illinois iowa minnesota colorado and georgia the company 
employs about 38000 people worldwide 
karl mantyla a uaw spokesman in detroit said the union was not 
interested in extending deeres contract its a hard and fast 
deadline as far as were concerned he said 
elliott anderson a chief uaw negotiator at the caterpillar 
talks said the union was shifting all of its attention to deere 
because we think thats the best place where weve had some 
movement 
anderson said the union likely would use a settlement with deere 
as a pattern for talks with caterpillar were going to take 
a look at deere and see what we can do about doing the same thing 
here he said 
uaw officials began meeting daily with deere on aug 11 seeking 
to restore salary cuts accepted in the 1987 contract 
at the caterpillar talks in the st louis suburb of bridgeton 
mo which began aug 4 union bargainers have been seeking the 
first merit pay raise in 10 years for workers at plants in 12 
cities in illinois iowa colorado tennessee and pennsylvania 
caterpillar has 58800 employees worldwide 
during the 1986 negotiations the previous contract was extended 
four times before a settlement was reached without a strike 
the extension requires each side to give a fiveday notice if 
they wish to terminate the agreement said mark polzin a 
caterpillar spokesman 
although workers for both companies were drawing up their 
picketduty rosters and making other strike preparations there was 
a universal desire to avoid a walkout 
but some workers preferred a walkout to a contract extension and 
that view was apparent friday in some caterpillar shops 
i dont think the reaction will be good among the working 
people the people in the plant said ed woker vice president of 
local 751 in decatur ill theres a lot of hard feelings the 
issues are there and they feel that there should be a settlement 
philip euler at local 2096 in pontiac ill said ive 
talked to people here and theyre not happy everybody feels 
theres been adequate time to settle this thing to make this 
indefinite does not make them happy nobody wants a strike but 
nobody wants an extension
