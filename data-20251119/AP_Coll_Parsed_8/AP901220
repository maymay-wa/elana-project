island in more than a decade it toppled trees pushed surf to more 
than 20 feet high and made movement around the 30milelong island 
virtually impossible 
everybodys just sitting tight guam civil defense spokesman 
mike franquez said well wait for the winds to pass and then 
assess the damage 
about 145000 people live on guam the last storm to cause major 
damage here was typhoon pamela in 1976 
winds were clocked at 90 mph with gusts to 115 mph when the 
storm made its closest pass before dawn said navy capt dieter

two courts thursday denied a request to 
have nancy cruzans feeding tube reconnected as demonstrators kept 
a vigil at the hospital where she is dying and launched new legal 
efforts to keep her alive 
yvette williams who cares for severely disabled children asked 
the courts to require the state to provide nourishment to ms 
cruzan who has been in a persistent vegetative state since a 1983 
traffic accident 
miss williams request was denied by the missouri supreme court 
and the missouri court of appeals 
she was represented by mario mandina of the antieuthanasia 
group lawyers for life mandina said he planned to return to the 
missouri supreme court to seek a rehearing 
at least two new legal attempts to force ms cruzans feeding 
tube to be reconnected were launched 
ms cruzan 33 is the central figure in a righttodie case 
that went to the us supreme court and culminated dec 14 with a 
probate judges decision that her parents could order her feeding 
tube removed 
the tube was withdrawn hours later doctors estimated ms cruzan 
would die within two weeks without food and water her condition 
deteriorated thursday 
our laws protect life miss williams who lives in kansas 
city said in a prepared statement what is happening here 
offends me i cannot in conscience be a party to the killing of 
nancy cruzan 
protesters from the antiabortion movement have converged since 
the tube was removed on the missouri rehabilitation center where 
ms cruzan is looked after in this southwestern missouri town of 
3400 the protesters say the cruzan case is an extension of their 
cause 
police arrested 19 demonstrators tuesday after they refused to 
leave they remained thursday in the lawrence county jail 
about 15 protesters gathered thursday on the porch of the 
hospital where they said they would maintain a vigil until ms 
cruzan dies 
the supreme court rejected ms williams request in a 
twosentence order it was signed by judge edward robertson who 
wrote the courts november 1988 decision that denied a request from 
ms cruzans parents joe and joyce cruzan for authority to remove 
the tube providing their daughter food and water 
that ruling sent the case to the us supreme court which ruled 
in june in its first righttodie case that missouri could require 
clear and convincing evidence ms cruzan would not want to live 
in the vegetative state 
at a hearing last month former coworkers testified ms cruzan 
had said she would never want to live like a vegetable 
in a separate effort to have ms cruzans feeding tube 
reconnected a civil rights lawsuit was filed in us district 
court in springfield by the rev pat mahoney director of the 
center for christian activism in boca raton fla 
nancy cruzan has no advocate no one to stand for her no one 
to appeal this decision mahoney said 
a hearing was set for friday

president patricio aylwin on thursday 
called in the army commander and former chilean ruler gen augusto 
pinochet to demand an explanation of why the military refused to 
leave its barracks the day before 
as pinochet entered and left the downtown presidential palace 
hundreds of people demonstrated against him chanting antimilitary 
slogans and urging aylwin to demand his resignation 
pinochet said the military moves wednesday were just an 
exercise but government officials and others had described them as 
a protest over news reports on an illegal financial institution 
involving highranking officers 
the chilean media has widely reported on the scandal for weeks 
alleging that a savings and loan operation run by people in the 
military resulted in losses for individual depositors that ranged 
as high as 500000 
wednesdays action by the soldiers was the first instance of 
military unrest since pinochets military rule ended nine months 
ago it raised fears that the military might challenge civilian 
control 
but the civilian government said democracy was not in danger 
the goverment said thursday in a communique that pinochet spoke 
to the president during an hourlong meeting at the presidential 
palace where the former military ruler was summoned by his 
civilian successor 
aylwin the communique said required from the commander in 
chief and explanation for the unusual measures taken by the 
institution he commands 
pinochet explained that it was a security readiness and 
coordination exercise which ended this morning and it had no 
extrainstitutional connotations the brief communique said 
as he left the presidential palace a smiling relaxed pinochet 
also told reporters the confining to barracks was an exercise 
asked why the goverment was not informed beforehand he replied 
we dont have to tell the government this is army business the 
army has not bothered anybody has not taken to the streets 
aylwin is constitutionally prohibited from firing pinochet who 
remained commander of the 60000man army after handing over the 
presidency to the new civilian government 
meanwhile politicians from left to right on thursday expressed 
full support for the countrys newly restored democracy 
what we all want is to maintain the democratic system and i 
believe no one should do anything against it said jose pinera a 
former cabinet minister under pinochet and a close ally of the 
75yearold general 
sergio bitar a socialist leader called the military action a 
blackmail and a threat he said nobody in chile wants the 
consolidation of democracy to be halted

cuban president fidel castro has released a 
28yearold letter that appears to put to rest the notion that he 
favored a preemptive nuclear attack against the united states 
during the cuban missile crisis 
instead castro said in his letter to soviet leader nikita 
khrushchev that the soviets should exercise the nuclear option only 
if the united states invaded cuba for the purpose of occupying it 
two years ago at a moscow conference of american soviet and 
cuban participants in the 1962 crisis khrushchevs son sergei 
was reported to have told some american delegates that castro had 
recommended an immediate nuclear strike against the united states 
at the height of the crisis 
the purported comments of the younger khrushchev were widely 
reported at the time philip brenner an american university 
professor and expert on the crisis said wednesday that sergei 
khrushchev has retreated somewhat from his allegation about castro 
according to brenner sergei khrushchev now says that his 
authority for his comments was his fathers memory which may have 
been faulty 
the castro letter dated oct 26 1962 and reprinted in a 
communist party newspaper in havana recently showed that the cuban 
leader believed us military action was likely within 24 to 72 
hours 
castro said he saw two options an air attack against specific 
targets presumably the soviet nuclear facilities in cuba that had 
provoked the crisis and less likely an outright us invasion 
of cuba 
castros letter asserted that the danger for humanity of a us 
invasion would be such that the only solution would be to 
eliminate forever that danger notwithstanding how hard and 
terrible that solution might be 
castro warned that the soviets could be the target of a us 
nuclear strike if the united states were able to invade and occupy 
the island 
two days after the castro letter at a time when the crisis had 
eased considerably as a result of an agreement khrushchev wrote 
castro that it would be necessary of course to repel a us 
invasion by all means necessary 
the letter added one must not be carried away by 
provocations because the unchecked pentagon militarists want 
to thwart the agreement and provoke you into actions which they 
could use against you we would ask you not to provide any excuse 
for this 
khrushchev said the conflict was being resolved in castros 
favor because the agreement provided for a us pledge not to 
invade cuba brenner said khrushchevs letter indicates that he 
viewed castro as a loose cannon 
as a followup to the moscow conference on the crisis the cuban 
government plans to host a meeting of its own in october during the 
29th anniversary of that episode 
a preparatory session for that meeting will be held on the 
caribbean island of antigua jan 46 among the americans scheduled 
to participate are former defense secretary robert s mcnamara and 
arthur schlesinger an adviser to president kennedy 
brenner said the cubans and the soviets have indicated they plan 
to bring documents that have never before been revealed

it may not do wonders for solving the trade 
imbalance but the japanese finally have found us products for 
which they are willing to pay big bucks secondhand goods 
a usstyle thrift store in southern tokyo called panic melon 
studio beverly hills has three floors crammed with bits and pieces 
of postwar americana that look as though they belong in a forgotten 
attic corner 
but in japan they sell for eyepopping prices 
a gallon 1957 cocacola bottle sells for 285 a worn out but 
working general electric refrigerator from the 1960s for 1880 a 
1975 mattel talking pink panther for 210 
an oldfashioned hoover vacuum cleaner goes for 285 a faded 
chipped dresser for 620 and a diner counter stool for 285 even 
empty egg cartons are available at 360 each 
this is an aesthetic of the passe dirtiness and ruin panic 
melon supervisor bonjour watanabe says with a wave of his hand 
we spend a lot of effort trying to present unfashionable 
american things as fashionable for the japanese 
there is indeed a fashion move toward 50s and 60s americana 
says hiromi egawa an editor at a monthly magazine for young 
middleclass women jackie kennedy is very popular now she 
says 
watanabe 33 says the store rakes in about 45000 a month on 
sales and rental of goods that he and his staff collect from thrift 
stores flea markets and individual collectors in los angeles 
more than half of panic melons income comes from rental for 
props for fashion magazine shoots and television commercials he 
says 
a number of other stores in tokyo also sell used american goods 
from stonewashed denim to birdshaped decoys 
sometimes an american customer will wander into the store and 
pick up an item with an old american price tag of 3 still stuck on 
it watanabe said when we tell them the actual price say 
210 the american usually gets very angry and we almost get into 
a fight 
then watanabe explains to the visitor that a sizable investment 
went into obtaining the wares because of air fare lodging and gas 
in the united states as well as shipment and duty costs 
but most of the time the american wont buy it watanabe 
says with a smile 
japanese however are a different story 
i come here often i have bought a road sign that i hang in my 
home and small items like forks and knives said junichi 
yamamoto a 23yearold architect clad in a leather jacket i 
usually spend about 10000 yen 75 on each visit 
those who studied in the united states are drawn to the 
functional dining tables and chairs that remind them of their 
younger days he says 
there are also the mechanically inclined who are thrilled to 
buy scrap motorcycle parts and there are the rock n roll freaks 
with greasedback hair for whom all the rubbish is highclass 
fashion 
there are things here that are practically garbage watanabe 
admits but we need to keep the space filled and youd be 
surprised at what gets bought 
watanabe says japanese who typically wouldnt be caught dead 
wearing last years clothes are awed by the unwillingness of 
americans to throw anything away 
it allows this to exist he says lifting a basket of 
discolored fake flowers

nasa an agency that literally relies on 
rocket scientists should be allowed different personnel rules than 
the rest of government if the space program is to keep its edge a 
federal committee says 
the national aeronautics and space administration likely will 
have trouble recruiting the best and brightest during the 1990s if 
it has to stick to civil service pay restrictions the advisory 
committee on the future of the us space program said in its final 
report wednesday 
the committee issued a summary of the report last week c emphasis 
on science less dependence on the space shuttle 
by developing new cargocarrying rockets and a simpler more easily 
maintained space station than the one being planned 
we are at an appropriate time to step back and view where we 
are galling 
for moreoing and what is the best way to get there the panel said 
among the most needed ingredients of americas space program is a 
consensus of support for its goals and its resource needs 
whatever they may be 
private industry is able to pay 5000 to 10000 a year more 
than nasa to new college graduates and the gap is widening the 
report said pointing to science and engineering as especially 
acute staff problems 
at the other end of the scale postemp rather than a mission whose 
design is frozen in time

nasas mission is probably more difficult 
than that of any other organization in the world says a report 
by the advisory committee on the future of the us space program 
it offered this illustration of what makes the national 
aeronautics and space adminstrations job so tough 
each voyager spacecraft has the electronic circuitry of over 
2000 color television sets yet is required to work for 12 years 
while traveling from earth to neptune 
the two voyager spacecraft schedules were absolutely 
unforgiving the planets in their paths aligning themselves only 
once every 176 years yet by the time voyager 2 reached neptune 
44 billion miles away and 12 years later the spacecraft was a 
mere 22 miles off its charted course and only one second off its 
updated flyby time 
mechanical challenges are equally impressive each space 
shuttle contains some 300 miles of electrical wiring over 3000 
feet of welds and over 25 million lines of software code its 
pumps propel 65000 gallons the capacity of a large swimming pool 
through its engines each minute 
the power turbine on the shuttle operates at a temperature of 
1300 degrees fahrenheit just four feet away the pump turbine 
operates at minus 400 degrees fahrenheit 
the hubble space telescope involved a total of over 40 million 
hours of work to process a space shuttle for flight requires that 
12 million separate procedures be accomplished 
furthermore nasa must do all that it does in the public 
spotlight which is of course as it should be

new medicines tailored to block a troublesome body 
chemical appear to stop allergic reactions before they start and 
could also provide relief to millions of asthma and hay fever 
sufferers scientists reported today 
the drugs still in their experimental stages thwart the bodys 
production of substances known as leukotrienes thy are among the 
chief culprits in triggering common allergic reactions 
what makes this important is that its a new way of treating 
asthma said dr jeffrey m drazen of bostons beth israel 
hospital other drugs put out the fire once its started we 
havent had a way to prevent the problem in the first place which 
is what these drugs do 
unlike many other allergy medicines these drugs appear to have 
no side effects if they prove safe and effective in additional 
testing they could have widespread use 
asthma and hay fever are incredibly prevalent diseases these 
are potential approaches that could impact on the lives of 25 
percent of the people in the united states said dr michael 
kaliner of the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases 
doctors said the drugs could supplement or replace several of 
the asthma drugs already in use such as cromolyn and theophylline 
some of these drugs have side effects including tremors nausea 
vomiting headaches and drowsiness 
an estimated 35 million to 40 million americans get hay fever 
and 12 million to 15 million have asthma 
this is an area people have been studying for a long time 
said dr suzanne hurd of the national heart lung and blood 
institute this is the first example that we might have some 
payoff here its very promising and exciting 
dr howard r knapp of the university of iowa used the 
experimental abbott laboratories drug zileuton to prevent hay fever 
symptoms in people allergic to ragweed and grasses 
in the other studies researchers from beth israel used the same 
drug to prevent asthma induced by breathing cold air and doctors 
from mcmaster university in hamilton ontario gave the merck sharp 
and dohme drug venzair to prevent asthma triggered by exercise 
the three studies were published in todays new england journal 
of medicine 
elsewhere doctors are experimenting with similar 
leukotrieneblocking drugs against such ailments as rheumatoid 
arthritis the skin disease psoriasis and the digestive illness 
ulcerative colitis 
leukotrienes are known to cause tightening of the air passages 
in the lungs and increase mucous production in the nose but until 
the recent development of drugs that block leukotrienes scientists 
could not prove their importance in allergic reactions 
knapp gave the drug to eight people with hay fever when they 
were exposed to ragweed or grass seven of them had a lot less 
congestion 
in the beth israel study doctors tested zileuton on 13 people 
whose asthma is triggered by cold dry air the drug increased 
their tolerance of cold by 47 percent 
in the mcmaster study dr patrick j manning and others tested 
venzair on 12 people who regularly got asthma during exercise the 
treatment reduced their asthma by 70 percent and in three people 
prevented it entirely

the district attorneys office says its hitting 
the law books to learn whether a sweepstakes offering an american a 
ride aboard the soviet space station is legal 
the sweepstakes had been called a hoax earlier this week by the 
soviet news agency tass but soviet officials wednesday confirmed 
they had a contract with space travel services of houston to take 
someone aboard mir 
two company executives wednesday went before a grand jury 
investigating whether the giveaway which contestants can enter by 
dialing a 900number for 299 violates texas law against charging 
someone for a chance to win something 
space travel services contends that because contestants can also 
enter for free by mail the sweepstakes complies with the law 
its our position maybe not said russel turbeville head 
of the district attorneys consumer fraud division our concerns 
are whether or not they are in good faith and even if they are in 
good faith whether this constitutes an illegal lottery 
were going to do a little more legal research said 
turbeville 
if the contest is found to be illegal the operators could face 
penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a 5000 fine 
david mayer president of space travel services and james 
davidson senior vice president had been subpoenaed to appear 
before the grand jury but the subpoenas were dismissed after they 
agreed to cooperate turbeville said 
you do something big and different and people are going to 
look into it davidson said we think thats the way it should 
be these folks at the district attorneys office are doing their 
job 
we expect a clean bill of health from this investigation 
a person will be selected in a drawing in december 1991 for a 
space trip in 1992 or 1993 plus 500000 the company said

a treatment intended to weaken the immune system 
temporarily to prevent orga rejection has been linked with a 
sharply increased cancer risk in heart transplant patients doctors 
reported today 
doctors from loyola university medical center said 11 percent of 
their patients who got the treatment developed lymphoma a blood 
cell cancer the cancers typically developed a month or two after 
the surgery and were rapidly fatal 
the treatment called okt3 is a tailormade antibody that 
attacks a variety of white blood cells that play a key role in 
making the body reject the transplanted organ okt3 gained 
widespread use about three years ago 
the new study shows that even if okt3 prevents rejection and 
this is in doubt the benefit comes at a high cost 
we found that the addition of okt3 was statistically strongly 
linked with a sharp increase in this form of cancer said dr 
lode j swinnen who directed the study 
people who get transplanted organs routinely receive a variety 
of medicines that temporarily weaken their defenses this is 
intended to thwart the bodys tendency to attack the alien organ 
doctors have long recognized that these medicines increase the 
risk of blood cancer however swinnens study published in the 
new england journal of medicine found that okt3 heightened the 
risk dramatically 
of 79 heart transplant patients who got the treatment at loyola 
nine developed lymphoma and six of them died 
in an accompanying editorial dr israel penn of the university 
of cincinnati medical center said the use of these drugs and the 
development of cancer indicate that we have much to learn about 
walking the tightrope between preventing rejection and inducing 
lymphomas 
but overall he said only about 1 percent of all transplant 
recipients die of cancer penn said the risk should not stop 
transplants but instead should spur research to find better 
alternative drugs

pink slips go out next month for about 1000 
employees of the canadian broadcasting corp the governmentowned 
network many see as the glue that holds together this vast and 
diverse nation of 26 million people 
the bad news comes from budgetcutters who are slashing 10 
percent of the corporations staff closing television stations and 
reducing services 
their goal is to make up a projected shortfall of 91 million in 
next years 935 million budget 
declining advertising revenues reduced government funding and 
rising tv production costs have hurt the network deeply about 75 
percent of production costs comes from the government 
angry public protests have occurred from newfoundland to ontario 
to the gaspe peninsula of quebec over what many feel are cuts in 
one of the few things that make canadians really different from 
americans 
the cbc will cut 1100 of its nearly 11000 permanent positions 
effective april 5 
the cbc is known internationally for highly rated dramas fully 
82 percent of its television prime time is canadian in content 
this year featuring such drama series as road to avonlea de 
grassi high and street legal 
previous budget cuts have slowed efforts to make cbc prime time 
95 percent canadian the latest round of layoffs are aimed mainly 
at local stations but are also expected to have some impact at the 
national level 
in announcing the cutbacks and closures dec 5 cbc president 
gerard veilleux said they were permanent and would not be reversed 
even if there is a turn in the 54yearold corporations economic 
fortunes 
a major element in the costsaving program was closure of three 
television stations entirely and reducing eight others to small 
news reporting bureaus feeding their reports into regional and 
national centers 
windsor a city of 200000 inhabitants just across the detroit 
river from a megalopolis of 4 million was particularly hardhit 
because cancellation of the cbcs local programming there left it 
only with news canned in toronto 
this is windsor and were sick of getting shoved around 
mayor john millson told the 5000 people who took to the streets on 
sunday 
most major canadian cities have competing private radio and 
television stations some providing popular local newscasts 
but the loss of a strong cbc presence in windsor means it is 
even more difficult to maintain a separate identity from detroit 
which has more than 60 television and radio stations beaming into 
canada 
getting local news is very important to windsor residents 
particularly on weekends when there is no sunday paper 
employees in saskatoon saskatchewan have received a provincial 
grant to study the feasibility of buying the local cbc station 
reduced to a reporting bureau for the regional center in regina 
the corporation says there have been a number of queries to 
purchase stations which will be considered 
the cbc says that henceforth it will be not have more than one 
englishlanguage station and one frenchlanguage station per 
province 
that means for example that calgary alberta no longer has its 
own local cbc newscasts but instead must transmit versions it 
receives from rival edmonton 
closure of goose bay which served 35 small communities means 
news for labrador will be produced in st johns 450 miles away 
the same is true for saskatoon and regina 
the cbc also announced it no longer will operate the 
parliamentary channel which broadcasts debate in the house of 
commons or radio canada international the shortwave service that 
broadcasts in 14 languages abroad 
iqbal rahemtulla a spokesman for the corporation said the 
house of commons may take over the funding of the parliamentary 
broadcast and the ministry of external affairs because of 
international ramifications is considering ways to maintain radio 
canada internationals services 
if all that wasnt bad enough the cbcs projections show that 
there will be another shortfall of about 42 million in the 199293 
budget 
emerging relatively unscathed except for a 1 percent budget 
reduction is cbc radio broadcasting in both french and english to 
every canadian in this gigantic country 
the radio which carries no advertising features news current 
events talk shows and music to a wide range of audiences on both 
am and fm 
its northern service also broadcasts in english french and 
eight native languages and dialects 
also continuing are the networks wellregarded national 
televison news programs the journal and the national as 
well as its 24hour allnews channel newsworld 
it is certainly sad said rahemtulla the cbc has been cut 
to the bone now

equality by changing policies on scholarships for minority 
students 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif used a hearing of his committee 
wednesday to alternate criticisms of the education departments 
civil rights chief and an administration ruling that limits 
racedesignated college scholarships 
this first hearing is to examine yet another of the 
administrations policies and misguided efforts to turn back the 
clock on equality said hawkins who is retiring at year end 
he said a decision by assistant education secretary michael l 
williams head of the civil rights office not to appear before the 
panel to explain the new policy on minority scholarships is an 
affront to the committee to the congress and to american people 
rep kweisi mfume dmd described williams absence as a 
snub of his nose at the committee and called on him to do the 
right thing and resign your position move out of the way so a 
more rational policy can be developed 
in testimony educators and civil rights officials urged the 
administration to reverse the policy arguing that tuesdays 
partial backtracking had merely confused the issue they said 
congress should step in and act if the administration failed to do 
so 
williams declared last week that the 1964 civil rights act 
prohibited reserving scholarships for members of minority groups 
the administration backed off in part after protests from civil 
rights groups and from educators who said such a ruling would hurt 
the chances of thousands of minorities to get college educations 
under the revised policy which brought new criticism from the 
right and left as well as promises of legal challenges public 
universities and private schools that receive federal funding would 
be allowed to award such aid if they used only private money 
earmarked for that purpose 
racebased scholarships funded by state and local governments 
generally would not be allowed although congressionally mandated 
scholarships for minorities would continue as in the past 
the education department set a fouryear transition period for 
schools to review programs under title six of the civil rights act 
and comply 
robert atwell president of the american council on education 
representing colleges and universities said the new policy 
creates a distinction without a difference he explained that 
once money is given to a school it generally is considered 
institutional funds 
we hope the administration recognizes the error of this 
approach and the foolishness of pursuing such a policy he added 
if not we certainly hope the congress will undertake to reverse 
the policy and deny the administration the opportunity of putting 
it into effect 
richard rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities testified the ruling draws a 
distinction between restricted funds and other funds available to 
private colleges and universities to award minority scholarships 
rosser described as patently absurd and without legal 
foundation the notion that private colleges and universities may 
accept money from donors who designate minority scholarships but 
cannot use their own funds for the same purpose 
rosser said 82 percent of all black undergraduates attending 
independent institutions received financial assistance as did 72 
percent of hispanic undergraduates and 59 percent of asianamerican 
undergraduates 
in 1986 he said 309000 minority students attending public and 
independent colleges and universities received some 750 million in 
aid from the institutions own resources 
david s tatel a washington attorney who served as director of 
the office for civil rights from 1977 to 1979 said williams 
office has no authority to tell anyone that some minority 
scholarships are now suddenly illegal simply by making an 
announcement 
tatel said the office can bind recipients of federal funds only 
by formal regulation or by initiating formal fund termination 
proceedings and prevailing before an administration law judge and 
if necessary a federal court

white house opposition is prompting the 
environmental protection agency to scuttle proposed requirements 
for recycling by trash incinerators 
the agency decided wednesday to delete from incinerator 
regulations to be issued dec 31 a provision that would require at 
least 25 percent of incoming garbage be recycled as a condition for 
a burning permit 
the recycling requirement met strong opposition earlier 
wednesday during a meeting of the presidents council on 
competitiveness an interagency panel chaired by vice president dan 
quayle that reviews regulatory proposals for their impact 
in the face of the stiff criticism epa administrator william 
reilly agreed to withdraw the recycling provision although he 
argued in favor of it during the session said administration 
sources familiar with the white house discussions they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in a telephone interview reilly confirmed the decision to 
withdraw the recycling requirement in the rules that will establish 
new standards for air emissions for garbage incinerators 
we will not propose source separation of at least 25 percent 
in these new standards he said 
reilly said it was decided that the planned regulation was not 
the appropriate vehicle for a major mandatory recycling program 
with significant potential to disrupt local government plans for 
incineration programs 
environmentalists had praised the epa when it included the 
recycling provision in a proposed incineration rule a year ago 
they argued the provision would reduce the amount of wastes burned 
and therefore air pollution 
this is a major environmental retreat david doniger an 
attorney for the natural resources defense council said after 
wednesdays action the administration is retreating on its own 
commitment for recycling 
administration sources said reilly had tried to enlist support 
for the recycling provision and reiterated his defense of the 
requirement at the meeting of the regulatory review panel 
among those reported arguing against mandatory recycling for 
incinerators were henson moore the deputy energy secretary 
richard darman the white house budget director and michael 
boskin chairman of the council of economic advisers the sources 
said 
they maintained that the costs of recycling a quarter of the 
garbage destined for incineration outweighed the benefits and could 
hinder development of wastetoenergy programs in some communities 
they argued that the issue of recycling should be dealt with 
separately next year when federal laws on waste disposal come up 
for reconsideration in congress 
the epa incinerator regulation will set stricter air pollution 
standards for trash burning at a time when an increasing number of 
communities see incineration as a means of dealing with a growing 
shortage of landfill space especially in the east 
reilly argued forcefully for the recycling measure in 
cabinetlevel discussions but when no compromise could be reached 
the matter was turned over to the quayle review group reilly could 
have appealed the matter to president bush but declined to do so 
the waste disposal industry had opposed the recycling provision 
and argued that it could jeopardize some potential garbage 
incineration programs which already are often highly 
controversial 
waste combustion is now seen as a costeffective and 
environmentally sound means of solid waste management for many 
communities this could change if burdensome and perhaps costly 
recycling requirements are a condition allen moore president of 
the national solid waste management association recently wrote 
reilly 
the group represents 2500 companies involved in waste disposal

practices stem from centuries of tradition 
reindeer are a common festive dish 
of course we eat reindeer for christmas says jan amundsen 
a lapp who has herded the animals in north norway for 25 years 
without ever driving reindeer sleigh 
ole k sara norways reindeer administrator says the herds 
provided the lapps with meat milk transport and clothing until

a top republican is urging the bush 
administration to rethink government support for a practice whereby 
private universities give admission preferences to children of 
alumni 
lets face it equal opportunity means just that equal 
admissions opportunities for all not just a few these alumni 
perks have absolutely nothing to do with an individuals 
qualifications or merit senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
said wednesday 
he asked the education department to reconsider a recent agency 
finding that legacy preferences in college admissions were 
lawful under the 1964 civil rights act 
doles request came as criticism continued to mount over another 
administration education policy civil rights activists and 
educators are asking the education department to abandon its policy 
limiting racebased college scholarships 
dole in a statement complained that the university admission 
preferences created unfair advantages for children of alumni who 
often are wealthy contributors to the school 
now is the time to take the next logical step on the fairness 
front the last thing we need in american education is a caste 
system said dole 
if we are serious about a national reexamination of 
preferential policies in employment and education then we have an 
obligation to be both fair and consistent in our approach 
dole sent a letter tuesday to lamar alexander nominated as 
education secretary by president bush asking the department to 
reexamine whether the admission preferences were permissible under 
civil rights law 
in october the acting director of the education departments 
regional office in boston concluded there was nothing unlawful 
about harvard universitys admissions preferences for children of 
alumni the finding came as part of a department investigation to 
determine whether there was discrimination against asianamericans 
who applied for admission to harvard 
dole in his letter to alexander said if nonmeritbased 
criteria like the legacy preference are used to determine who gets 
access to the best educations in this country then the very 
assumptions undergirding our society that the rules of the game 
are fair to all and that merit will prevail are called into 
question 
the senator also made clear that republicans had a political 
stake in the issue of educational fairness 
at a time when the republican party is promoting the ideal of 
a merit society we ought to be applying this principle across 
the board and not selectively dole wrote 
he pointed out that republicans including bush had opposed 
civil rights legislation this year largely on grounds that it would 
lead to sex and racebased hiring quotas by employers 
we were silent however on college admission practices like 
the legacy preference that had the effect of benefiting those at 
the upper end of the income scale to the detriment of the 
economically less advantaged dole wrote this silence is 
understandable since almost all of the debate was over employment 
policy not education policy but the two are linked

the dollar rose sharply against the japanese yen in 
tokyo thursday while share prices fell 
the dollar closed at 13458 yen up 131 yen from wednesdays 
close of 13327 yen after opening at 13400 yen it ranged between 
13385 and 13465 yen 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
finished at 2452494 points down 35184 points or 141 percent 
from wednesdays close of 2487678 points 
in bond dealings the price of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds fell to 8806 points from wednesdays 
8823point close their yield stood at 7055 percent up from 
7020 percent wednesday 
currency dealers said expectations of lower japanese interest 
rates weakened the yen although bank of japan gov yasushi mieno 
has denied any plans to follow the us federal reserves example 
the us central bank injected reserves into the us banking 
system wednesday to push the federal funds rate the interest 
banks charge to make loans to each other to 7 percent 
that cut followed a fed decision tuesday to cut its discount 
rate the interest charged to lend money to banks to 6 percent 
from 7 percent 
the lower federal funds rate had little direct effect in the 
tokyo market because it was already taken into account said a 
dealer at yasuda trust and banking who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but the approach of the jan 15 deadline for iraqs withdrawal 
from kuwait was strengthening the dollar dealers said 
investors tend to buy dollars as a shelter in times of 
uncertainty 
on the stock market the nikkei average fell in early trading 
from profittaking but investors expecting the bank of japan to 
lower interest rates refrained from active selling traders said 
the weaker yen also discouraged buying they said

hunters sharing their game with the 
homeless and hungry are getting heat from animalrights groups and 
health officials willing to look a gift deer or elk moose or red 
stag in the mouth 
from celebrities on safari in hawaii and colorado to michigan 
deerstalkers hunters nationwide are donating their kill to soup 
kitchens and homeless shelters 
without increasing the number of animals taken we can feed all 
of the nations homeless this way said bob easterbrook a 
detroit businessman leading safari club internationals sportsmen 
against hunger campaign in michigan 
generosity aside some warn the meat could be dangerous 
it seems to be a step backward when we permit uninspected meat 
to be served not only to the public but to the indigent said 
phil kirkwood with the michigan health department 
easterbrook on wednesday countered the logic escapes me 
because these people are presently eating out of dumpsters and 
garbage cans 
animal protection groups call the wild food drive a public 
relations gimmick to make hunting look good 
this is spin doctoring said wayne pacelle national 
director of the fund for animals these individuals are spending 
tens of thousands of dollars to kill rare animals theyre out to 
kill for fun 
anybody who fights this program has never been hungry said 
easterbrook who is trying to expand game giveaways by persuading 
the states 735000 deer hunters to share 
stocking soup kitchen freezers with venison and elk is getting 
increased attention as those serving the needy try to fill the 
widening gap between government grants and local need 
the safari club followed the lead of actor kurt russell a 
hunter who donated game from celebrity safaris in colorado and 
hawaii 
sportsmen at a texas hunting ranch regularly donate exotic kills 
to the needy fallow deer black bucks red stag elk and buffalo 
are turned over to the local salvation army 
wild game is the main red meat handed out at the flathead food 
bank in flathead county mont but it doesnt always come from 
hunters the pantry is on 24hour call with the sheriff to pick up 
road kill the agency distributed 5800 pounds of venison elk and 
moose in 1989 
giving game to food pantries is an old practice in michigan but 
it didnt become legal until dec 13 when gov james blanchard 
signed a law opening a loophole in meat inspection laws 
what you really do is create a double standard kirkwood 
said you folks who can afford to pay for a meal were not going 
to let you have anything but approved meat but the indigent were 
going to let you have wild game and road kill 
michigan united conservation clubs defended the game giveaway 
venison is a very highquality lean source of protein it is 
of course without hormones and other additives that go into modern 
meat production so we thought it was ludicrous that the health 
department was fearful said spokesman rick jameson 
michigan hunters bag about 25 million pounds of venison a year 
and could reduce soup kitchen costs considerably if the program 
expands jameson said 
salvation army officials are grateful but dont like being in 
the crossfire between hunters and those who oppose the giveaways 
were in some ways caught between two forces said gene 
rietfors head of development for the salvation army in eastern 
michigan we dont want to be in a position of rejecting any kind 
of meat that is suitable and edible and appropriate to serve to 
hungry people 
and how do the hungry feel about the controversy 
if your family is hungry it certainly is meat said 
salvation army capt linda hogabooms in owosso

the massachusetts institute of 
technology is exporting americanstyle creativity to a japanese 
university eager to copy mits media laboratory where hardheaded 
science blends with imagination 
under the fiveyear 10 million agreement mit will help the 
japanese establish a lab with a loose creative atmosphere rare in 
japan 
theyre getting an experience with a style of research a way 
of running a research lab said nicholas negroponte the labs 
founder and director theyre creating a lab the style of which 
is similar to ours but the research content will be driven by 
those who run it 
critics say the lab will hurt the united states by helping the 
japanese catch up in one of the few technological areas where 
america still has an edge the development of futuristic products 
such as highdefinition tv 
by giving this to the japanese they will be much more powerful 
competitors said amar bose a professor of electrical 
engineering at mit and founder of bose corp a framingham 
manufacturer of stereo equipment 
under the agreement nihon university and the japanese 
industrialist chiyoji misawa will pay the mit lab 10 million over 
five years misawa is a builder interested in computercontrolled 
houses 
founded in 1985 the mit lab has been a center for scientists 
seeking new applications for computers holography television and 
other media researches and graduate students often dressed in 
jeans and tshirts work in an environment where creativity and 
science are allowed to mix freely 
among the mit projects is technology to send movies over 
telephone lines so people could dial a number and have a film 
transmitted directly to their tv set 
scientists are also researching highdefinition television and 
examining ways to use computers and interactive video games to help 
children learn 
the lab throws people of different disciplines together on the 
theory the mixture will produce applications with some value 
said cambridge media consultant larry levine you might get an 
engineer in with a political scientist and the likelihood is 
theyll produce something the engineer wouldnt have come up with 
alone 
bose said the japanese have failed to create such a research 
environment on their own 
the japanese learned manufacturing from us and then did a 
better job bose said but in terms of creativity that brings 
new technological approaches they recognize thats one of their 
weaknesses thats about the only thing the us has an edge in 
the creative side 
negroponte said he found criticism of the deal ironic since the 
much of labs research had not been taken seriously in the past 
what once was accused of being frivolous is now is seen as 
critical research he said 
the pact was negotiated four years ago and expires in 1992 so 
far three japanese scientists have spent a year each at mit 
observing the facility 
in addition the labs 19 scientists traveled to japan to check 
a small prototype lab while the japanese waited for permission to 
build the real thing 
two graduates of the mit lab were hired this year to help start 
the japanese lab 
the agreement is not the first between mit and the japanese 
earlier this year the japanese toymaker nintendo gave 3 million to 
the lab for research into how children can learn while playing

when contemplating his christmas 
rounds santa claus has about 10 gazillion american routes to 
choose from 
to be more precise the number of christmas routes in the united 
states alone would be expressed by 10 trailed by 60 million zeroes 
researchers at atampt bell labs say theyre awed that santa always 
manages to pick the best route 
santas itinerary is actually a variation on the old 
mathematical puzzle known as the traveling salesmans problem 
how to determine the most efficient possible route for a traveler 
who has to stop once at each location 
grace r emlin an atampt researcher explained that a traveling 
salesman with 10 cities to visit would have 10 choices for his 
first stop then nine for his second eight for his third and so 
on down to one multiplying the numbers one through 10 the 
salesman has 3628000 different routes to choose from 
in the united states there are about 25 million children under 
the age of 8 if 75 percent havent been naughty santa has about 
13 million stops in the united states alone emlin figured 
multiply all the numbers between one and 13 million and voila 
10 gazillion choices for santa and his reindeers 
the numbercrunching demanded by santas heavy itinerary is 
enough to blow the circuits of most computer systems emlin said 
bell labs can now find some of the most efficient routes on a 
millionstop trip in about four hours a task that would have taken 
10 billion hours of computer time in 1965 she said 
theres a lot of businesses that would like to acquire santas 
knack for scheduling emlin said 
for example some computer chips are etched with hundreds of 
millions of lines she said by applying the traveling santa er 
salesman problem scientists will be able to map out highly 
efficient paths for the etching process

before being broken up by 
clubwielding riot police strike by longdistance operators halted 
most international telephone service for more than 5 hours 
the job action wednesday by sandinistaaligned telephone union 
workers in managua was in support of about 400 employees in three 
provinces just south of the capital who have stopped work to demand 
40 percent salary increases 
a photographer said he was hit in the face when riot police 
forced about 30striking workers from telephone company offices at 
about 8 pm but no serious injuries were reported 
replacement workers were then brought in to restore 
longdistance service 
enresto ruleto deputy minister of the telecommunications and 
postal system said the police were called in after technicians 
went into the international operators room and began cutting 
lines 
a sandinista television newscast showed film of the police 
action 
the longdistance operators had refused calls for about 5 
hours 
directdial and telex service continued during the job action 
but lines were congested many of the countrys phones are not 
equipped for direct dial 
most telecommunications workers are holdovers from the leftist 
sandinista government that was voted out of office in february 
elections won by president violeta chamorro 
the workers had backed national strikes in may and june that 
forced her to drastically modify her plans for cutting government 
spending 
the telephone strike came as tension built over mrs chamorros 
veto of military budget cuts passed by members of the coalition 
that backed her in the feb 25 vote gaining a majority in the 
national assembly 
the veto was to be taken up by a legislative committee today 
leaders of the sandinistacontrolled army oppose the cuts and 
mrs chamorro has said they could plunge the country into chaos

the us government has agreed to stop 
deporting most salvadoran and guatemalan refugees and allow 
hundreds of thousands to seek political asylum in this country 
the agreement announced thursday settles a 1985 lawsuit 
accusing the government of maintaining a double standard in denying 
political asylum to almost all guatemalans and salvadorans who have 
applied since 1980 
the government agreed to halt deportations of all guatemalans 
and salvadorans except those accused of serious crimes and allow 
those held in detention centers to apply for release it wasnt 
immediately known how many aliens are incarcerated 
the settlement means as many as 150000 people denied political 
asylum since 1980 will have their cases reheard and an estimated 
350000 to 850000 guatemalans and salvadorans who never filed for 
asylum will have the opportunity to do so without fear of 
deportation said lawyers for the aliens 
this is a victory for the new leadership of the immigration 
and naturalization service that seems to be determined to end the 
bias and discrimination of the past said lucas guttentag a 
lawyer for the american civil liberties union one of the 
organizations that brought the lawsuit 
we think it is a fair agreement but well make no further 
statement said justice department spokesman joe krovisky 
the settlement is subject to approval at a hearing jan 31 
before us district judge robert peckham 
lawyers for the aliens had accused the us government of 
accepting most applicants from communist nations but rejecting most 
salvadorans and guatemalans because the united states had friendly 
relations with the two countries 
government lawyers had contended that salvadorans and 
guatemalans denied asylum were in the united states to pursue 
economic opportunities and not to escape political persecution 
according to the settlement the us government agrees to 
recognize that foreign policy and the governments opinion of 
political or ideological beliefs of the applicant are not 
proper factors in determining eligibility for asylum 
under the settlement the government also agreed to create a new 
corps of immigration and naturalization service officers to review 
the 150000 cases that had been rejected those officers will 
receive instruction in international human rights issues 
the lawsuit brought on behalf of 80 sanctuary organizations 
aiding salvadoran and guatemalan refugees charged that asylum was 
granted to only 3 percent of salvadorans and fewer than 1 percent 
of guatemalans applying on grounds that they feared political 
persecution if they returned to their strifetorn countries 
by contrast the lawsuit said asylum was granted to half or 
more of the refugees fleeing countries deemed to be communist 
including nicaragua and poland

army units early today ended a protest in 
which they refused to leave their barracks to express anger over 
what they call unfair media coverage of a financial scandal 
involving highranking officers 
the sixhour action wednesday was the first instance of unrest 
in the armed forces since military rule ended nine months ago but 
the newly restored civilian government said democracy was not in 
danger 
the chilean media has widely reported on the scandal for weeks 
alleging that a savings and loan operation run by people in the 
military resulted in losses for individual depositors that ranged 
as high as 500000 
the news reports have quoted lawyers victims and unidentified 
sources and the elected government of president patricio aylwin has 
indicted several retired officers in the case 
the government apparently out of sensitivity to the countrys 
powerful military has disclosed few details of the case 
many in the military charge that news reports about the scandal 
amount to an antiarmy smear campaign 
gen augusto pinochet who stepped down in march after 16 years 
in power but still heads the military on wednesday angrily called 
coverage of the savings and loan organization known as la cutufa 
press fabrications 
after the barracks protest had ended defense minister patricio 
rojas attempted to portray it as some sort of exercise 
emerging from a meeting at aylwins private residence he called 
the protest a mobilization to test some coordination plans 
earlier deputy foreign minister belisario velaso had confirmed 
the unrest at army garrisons but added the situation is calm 
throughout the country 
rojas denied press reports that the government had demanded the 
resignation of pinochet the army commander and former military 
president he said the army would later issue a communique 
explaining the situation 
rojas said the government fully respects the constitutional 
clause that allowed pinochet to remain army commander after handing 
over the presidency 
activity was intense at army headquarters wednesday night during 
the protest reporters saw scores of men entering the building 
many in plainclothes the men believed to be army personnel 
carried overnight bags 
no reports emerged of unrest om other branches of the armed 
services the army has 60000 troops the air force about 18000 
and the navy 29000 
the military in latin america has often confined itself to 
barracks as a means of expressing protest but such action is 
unusual in this country of 13 million people 
a special judge investigating la cutufa marcos libedinsky has 
indicted eight retired army officers for illegal financial 
operations among them was retired brig gen jaime lucares a 
former chief aide to pinochet 
pinochet himself ordered an internal army probe of la cutufa 
which according to press reports that were not denied resulted in 
punitive action against at least 150 officers and noncommissioned 
officers 
many were discharged the reports said 
libedinsky said the indicted officers are charged with breaking 
the national banking law in specific taking money for deposit 
then paying interest which chilean law forbids of private 
citizens 
it is not clear where the name la cutufa comes from some press 
reports said it was the name of a dog owned by one of those 
involved 
the last time chiles military attempted something similar was 
in october 1969 when officers barricaded themselves at a santiago 
regiment demanding higher pay for the military 
pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup overthrowing 
elected marxist president salvador allende who died in the 
takeover

nineteen gulf coast shrimpers are the first to 
face fines of up to 5000 for violating federal laws requiring 
that their nets have escape hatches for endangered sea turtles 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said the 
shrimpers were sentenced for criminal violations of a law that 
requires they use turtle excluder devices trap doors that keep the 
endangered turtles from drowning in their nets 
because sea turtles are airbreathers and shrimpers can trawl 
continuously for hours at a time many sea turtles drown in shrimp 
nets noaa said 
the 19 are the first to face fines under a criminal prosecution 
of the teds laws which make it illegal to fail to use a ted or to 
use one that doesnt work federal officials said 
according to leslie banks assistant us attorney for the 
southern district of texas nine shrimpers were sentenced in 
galveston and 10 others were sentenced in corpus christi after 
pleading guilty to teds violations two others were sentenced in 
brownsville to one years probation but were not fined 
all were sentenced since october some as recently as last week 
ms banks said 
the shrimpers had either failed to use teds or had sewn their 
teds shut ms banks said 
a florida shrimper meanwhile has received 30 days in jail for 
violating teds laws while shrimp trawling in the gulf of mexico

the government has moved to seize control of 
an atlantic city casino workers union whose alleged dirty work of 
murder extortion and bribery is said to be orchestrated from 
prison by a mafia boss 
in a federal racketeering lawsuit filed wednesday prosecutors 
charged that local 54 of the hotel and restaurant employees union 
has been controlled by the brunoscarfo crime family of 
philadelphia and new jersey for 20 years 
the lawsuit asks that a courtappointed trustee be put in 
control of the local and that its president william roy silbert 
and five other officials be removed 
attorney general dick thornburgh said at a news conference that 
removing the leadership is the only way to rid the union of mob 
influence 
local 54 represents about 22000 hotel bar and restaurant 
workers in atlantic city casinos and other new jersey 
establishments 
thornburgh aid prosecutors believe that nicodemo little 
nicky scarfo who is serving a life sentence for murder and 
racketeering has controlled the local from prison through his son 
nicodemo jr 
through their brutal and often deadly acts of violence and 
intimidation members of the brunoscarfo families have destroyed 
the integrity of the union and its leadership thornburgh said 
the lawsuit alleges the mob helped maintain its control of local 
54 through the murders of the presidents of two union locals in 
philadelphia and camden nj in 1973 and 1980 
thornburgh said the allegedly mobconnected union leaders were 
not hit with criminal charges because the burden of proof placed on 
the government is less in a lawsuit than in a criminal case 
a receptionist at local 54 headquarters in atlantic city said 
the union had no immediate comment 
a key witness in the case is expected to be philip crazy 
phil leonetti a mob turncoat who also is expected to testify in 
a criminal case against reputed gambino crime boss john gotti said 
us attorney michael chertoff 
the government first took control of a union using the federal 
racketeering statute in 1984 when a judge in newark appointed a 
trustee to run a teamsters local in union city and rid it of 
alleged mob influence 
in february the government filed a similar lawsuit against six 
locals of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union 
to end decades of alleged mob control of the new yorkarea 
waterfront

a top generals reservations about being ready 
to fight iraq by jan 15 could complicate president bushs campaign 
against saddam hussein and provide fresh ammunition to critics at 
home 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii have tried hard 
over the last few days to convince the iraqi president he risks war 
with the united states if all iraqi troops are not withdrawn from 
kuwait by the deadline 
the threat obviously depends for credibility on bush being able 
to carry it out with the us military machine being assembled in 
the persian gulf 
but army lt gen calvin ah waller the deputy commander of 
us forces there said wednesday they would not be ready to attack 
iraq for several weeks after jan 15 
if saddam were to think the united states is no equipped to go 
to war by then for whatever reason would he be inclined to drag 
his feet in pulling out 
impossible as it is to read the iraqi leaders mind his release 
of american hostages last week could mean he is taking the threat 
of war seriously 
sensing another ploy by saddam or possible backpedaling bush 
and baker went on the offensive this week 
the president said monday there must be total withdrawal by the 
deadline and that the united states would not yield one single 
inch in its demand for a full pullout 
baker followed up tuesday at nato headquarters in brussels with 
a warning that if saddam pulled out only partially the united 
states would not spare military measures to force all iraqi troops 
out of kuwait 
there can be no partial withdrawal the north atlantic 
treaty organization foreign ministers said in a statement echoing 
bakers threat 
taken literally saddam would have to withdraw nearly a 
halfmillion men from kuwait in less than a month logistically 
that would be a monumental undertaking even if he were to begin 
right away 
and yet bush and baker left no room for technical problems 
their demand is unqualified all iraqis out by jan 15 
logistics affect the us land and sea armada as well and 
waller said some crucial heavy ground forces probably would not 
reach saudi arabia by the deadline he said commanders were urging 
bush to delay any offensive action until the deployment is 
complete 
if saddam ignores the deadline and bush wants to order an attack 
in the days immediately afterward id tell him no im not 
ready to do the job the general said 
waller said he believed bush was aware of the readiness 
timetable but said it would be stressed again in meetings in saudi 
arabia among field commanders and bushs top two military 
officials defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
the jan 15 deadline was set by the united nations security 
council at the behest of the bush administration and over appeals 
by some members of congress that diplomacy and economic pressure be 
given more time to work 
the critics drew support from david jones and william crowe two 
former chairmen of the joint chiefs they told the senate armed 
services committee the sanctions imposed on iraq after the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait needed more time to be effective 
the white house tried wednesday to minimize wallers statement 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said that what the general really 
meant was that they might not be as ready as they would like to 
be for all the contingencies 
we are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are 
called upon to do fitzwater said 
and cheneys top spokesman warned saddam today from saudia 
arabia that us air power will be ready to attack by jan 15 
even if all ground forces are not 
pete williams said not having all ground forces fully ready for 
combat did not mean the americanled forces deployed against iraq 
could not initiate hostilities to free kuwait 
the air part of the force for example reaches its level of 
readiness earlier than the others williams said 
and the threestar officer in charge of army forces in saudia 
arabia lt gen john yeosock took a far more aggressive posture 
than waller saying im ready today for whatever mission ill be 
called upon to perform my perspective is saddam get out of 
kuwait or be prepared to face the consequences 
if war erupts yeosock said we will do everything in our 
power to apply maximum power in minimum time to maintain the 
highest uptempo battle ever recorded 
actually the general did not seem to be out of step with 
cheney his boss on his way to the gulf the defense secretary 
remarked that most of the forces would be in place by jan 15 
but obviously theres additional work to be done before you would 
identify them as combatready 
but in saudi arabia aides to powell and to wallers immediate 
boss gen h norman schwarzkopf expressed concern that waller had 
been too candid in discussing us readiness and deployment with 
reporters

the first postwar bulgarian government 
led by a noncommunist newly approved by parliament takes over a 
country gripped by economic crisis 13 months after hardline 
communists were swept from power 
prime minister dimitar popov a judge with no party affiliation 
and his cabinet were confirmed late wednesday they are to govern 
until new parliamentary elections that are likely to be held in may 
or june 
popov presented his new cabinet after nearly two weeks of 
bargaining between the two main political forces the opposition 
union of democratic forces and the socialists who are the party of 
former communists 
the two sides broke their deadlock over who would hold the 
interior ministry lawyer hristo danov an independent was named 
to the post which supervises law enforcement 
popov was chosen dec 7 to lead a new government after strikes 
and protests forced socialist premier andrei lukanov and his 
government of former communists to quit late last month 
lukanov was among reformers in the longruling party who helped 
push longtime hardline communist chief todor zhivkov from power in 
late 1989 after changing its name his party won a majority in 
june parliamentary elections 
but political bickering has prevented leaders from effectively 
attacking problems and the country fell into a severe economic and 
political tailspin 
electricity and many consumer goods are rationed or simply 
unavailable in sofia and elsewhere in this country of 9 million 
people 
popov was approved on a 25967 vote and his cabinet members were 
also individually confirmed 
the foreign ministry went to viktor vulkov of the agrarian 
party who will also serve as deputy premier 
the other deputy premiers are alexander tomov deputy chairman 
of the socialist party and dimitar ludzhev deputy head of the 
parliamentary faction of the union of democratic forces 
the socialists who hold 210 of the 400 seats in parliament 
kept the defense ministry under jordan mutafchiev 
the union of democratic forces which has 144 seats gained the 
crucial finance ministry it will be headed by the unions leading 
economist ivan kostov 
pencho penev of the socialist party was appointed justice 
minister a post he held in lukanovs first government he was 
interior minister in the outgoing government

the food and drug administration will audit at 
least 15 more generic drug companies to see whether they gave the 
fda false data to win approval for their products an agency 
official says 
i am not satisfied that weve turned over every rock daniel 
michels director of fdas office of compliance in the center for 
drug evaluation and research told a house subcommittee wednesday 
so far the fda has investigated 36 generic drug makers and has 
referred nine cases to the justice department for prosecution 
michels said it also has withdrawn product approvals for 105 
drugs and at least 231 products have been removed from the market 
he added 
meanwhile a federal investigation of generic drug companies has 
developed additional evidence of fraud and reckless disregard 
for the health of consumers and more arrests are expected a 
prosecutor testified 
breckenridge willcox us attorney for maryland said his 
baltimore office has found more instances of companies giving false 
documentation to the fda congress and a federal grand jury 
cheating on fda approval tests varying product formulas without 
fda approval and obstructing audits by the agency 
willcox said that since the investigation is still open he 
could not describe the evidence in detail 
but i can tell you that the evidence we have amassed presents 
an astounding picture of corporate greed arrogance and deceit 
coupled with reckless disregard for the health and safety of the 
consuming public he added 
i havent seen an industry that is as broadly corrupted as the 
generic drug industry willcox told the house energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee 
since the scandal came to light in june 1988 five former fda 
employees have been convicted including marvin seife who was 
director of the agencys generic drug division also convicted were 
seven generic drug company executives an industry consultant and 
three companies 
the charges ranged from bribery to accepting illegal gratuities 
to racketeering 
the two of the most recent charges were filed against employees 
of bolar pharmaceutical inc of copiague ny considered the 
flagship of the industry and more arrests involving the company 
are likely willcox said 
gena r finelli former director of the companys research and 
development laboratory pleaded guilty in october to obstructing an 
fda audit last week gloria h schetlick former manager of 
regulatory affairs at bolar pleaded guilty to making a false 
statement and obstructing justice 
none of the drugs involved so far has presented a public health 
or safety risk willcox said some products however were of 
unknown safety and efficacy because they were never tested against 
the brand name drug they imitated 
rep john dingell dmich subcommittee chairman noted that 
onethird to onehalf of the generic drugs being sold today are 
made by companies that have been convicted or are under 
investigation for crimes involving the approval process 
dingell said the information amassed by his panel and the us 
attorneys office proves beyond doubt that with notable 
exceptions the generic drug industry is the most pervasively 
corrupt this subcommittee has ever uncovered

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze resigned 
thursday stunning the congress of peoples deputies with a call to 
deny president mikhail s gorbachev the broader powers he seeks 
the man who has been foreign minister for nearly all of 
gorbachevs tenure as soviet leader told the body that 
dictatorship was coming to the soviet union which is being 
threatened with collapse by rebellious republics 
if you make a dictatorship no one can say who will become the 
dictator he said 
giving what he called one of the shortest and saddest speeches 
of my life the 62yearold shevardnadze urged the countrys 
highest legislative body not to approve measures that would vest 
greater power in the presidency 
the official tass news agency quoted shevardnadze as saying his 
decision was motivated by harrassment by his political 
adversaries whom he characterized as reactionaries 
when you push the voting button you decide the fate not only 
of gorbachev but of perestroika and democracy shevardnadze told 
the congress which has in the past supported gorbachev and is 
expected to vote during this session on his proposal to streamline 
the executive branch 
conservative members of the body have called on gorbachev to 
declare emergency rule in unstable republics and the soviet leader 
has said he would not hesitate to do so 
i am a friend of mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev and support 
the reform policies that he began nearly six years ago said 
shevardnadze the most visible figure in soviet politics after 
gorbachev 
we did a great deal together in the international arena he 
said 
but he said that as a friend and as a communist he could no 
longer stand silent while elected bodies surrender power to the 
soviet president 
shevardnadze was named foreign minister four months after 
gorbachev became communist party chief in march 1985 succeeding 
andrei a gromyko 
together with gorbachev he has steered soviet foreign policy 
away from confrontation and conquest in favor of appeasement and 
coexistence 
shevardnadzes drive against corruption as communist party chief 
in the georgian republic and his support of some economic 
experiments had marked him as a supporter of gorbachevs campaign 
for reform

prosecutors have decided to retry the two men 
whose murder convictions in the 1976 car bomb slaying of newspaper 
reporter don bolles were overturned a decade ago 
contractor max dunlap was charged wednesday with the murder of 
the arizona republic investigative reporter former plumber james 
robison was charged again in 1989 
john harvey adamson who was the prosecutions chief witness at 
the 1977 trial then refused to testify after the convictions were 
overturned has been offered a deal and will take the stand once 
more attorney general bob corbin said 
corbin said this time he has a stronger case but he wouldnt 
say what evidence he has or why adamson whom he once derided as no 
longer a credible witness was working with authorities again 
but a criminal complaint filed wednesday also accuses dunlap and 
robison this time of conspiring with others to obstruct justice and 
influence witnesses in the original case 
according to the complaint dunlap and robison were overheard 
talking about payments made to robison and adamson to keep them 
quiet over the last 14 years 
indictments returned earlier in the week also accused dunlaps 
former lawyer and robisons girlfriend of lying to a grand jury 
investigating the alleged conspiracy 
bolles died in 1976 11 days after a radiocontrolled bomb 
ripped through his car as he backed out of a hotel parking lot 
adamson testified that he planted the bomb under bolles car and 
robison triggered it on orders from dunlap he said dunlap wanted 
to ingratiate himself with land and liquor magnate kemper marley 
who had been the target of several critical stories by bolles 
marley died earlier this year 
bolles had won acclaim for his exposes on land fraud dog racing 
and organized crime 
robison and dunlap were convicted of murder and sentenced to 
death but the state supreme court reversed the convictions in 
1980 saying the defense had been unfairly prevented from asking 
adamson certain questions 
adamson a greyhound breeder and towtruck operator was 
originally allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges and sentenced 
to 20 years in prison in exchange for his testimony after the 
convictions were thrown out he refused to testify again unless 
authorities paid for his childrens education 
corbin said that destroyed adamsons credibility and he was 
then charged with murder he was convicted and is serving life in 
prison 
in exchange for his testimony this time his sentence will be 
reduced to a maximum of 20 years

albanias communist rulers are taking a 
twopronged approach to dissent legalizing the countrys first 
opposition party but also holding trials for suspects accused of 
involvement in rioting last week 
state media reported wednesday that courts have already 
sentenced at least 23 people to prison terms of up to 20 years 
more than 150 people have been brought to trial for 
antigovernment acts following the violence last week in four 
provincial centers albanian state radio has reported 
formal recognition on wednesday of the new democratic party of 
albania a week after its founding appeared to pave the way for 
multiparty elections after decades of oneparty communist rule 
croatias hina news agency reporting from the albanian capital 
of tirana said a political program issued by the new party 
declared that its goal was creation of a democratic society with a 
market economy instead of central planning 
the democrats are asking the government to postpone elections 
planned for february to allow more time for campaigning 
justice minister enver halili issued a signed and stamped 
document recognizing the new party party spokesman genc pollo said 
by telephone from tirana on wednesday 
the government decision to register the party appeared to 
reflect growing pressure on authorities to speed democratic 
reforms 
after the democratic revolutions that swept the former soviet 
bloc last year albania remained as europes last bastion of 
stalinist rule 
thousands of angry protesters burned and ransacked stores and 
other buildings in at least four cities last week several people 
were injured but no deaths were reported 
albanian radio said those convicted were found guilty of 
premeditated damage to common property violent resistance to the 
representatives of the state violation of the law on gatherings 
and socially undignified behavior 
the reports gave no date for the convictions and sentences but 
they were apparently handed down wednesday 
neighboring yugoslavias tanjug news agency cited albanian radio 
reports that lawyers and defendants are present at the trials and 
that the defendants are guaranteed the right of appeal 
pollo said that according to unofficial reports from those 
cities the trials were being held behind closed doors no 
officials could be reached for comment 
leaders of the new party distanced themselves from the unrest 
and condemned the violence in unprecedented appearances on national 
tv and in a statement printed in newspapers friday 
pollo said the official media had been silent about the new 
party and its leaders since 
he said the democrats party would request that elections 
scheduled for feb 10 be postponsed for three months to allow time 
to organize a campaign he said party leaders would probably apply 
for the extension this week

safety board has said the two trainmen were sober and were putting 
on the brakes when the accident occurred 
but the board has yet to conclude why amtraks night owl train 
from washington approached bostons back bay station at more than 
twice the speed limit a black box tape described wednesday by 
the safety board indicated that the train was traveling at 77 miles 
per hour when it derailed the speed limit at that point was 30 
mph 
the train derailed on a curve 500 feet outside the station and 
slammed into the rear of a sevencar train packed with 900 
commuters any train traveling faster than 60 mph would likely 
derail on that curve the ntsb said 
they still have a lot of work to do amtrak spokeswoman sue 
martin said of the ntsb probe until they have been able to 
examine every piece of information they will not be able to 
conclude whether the excessive speed of the train was caused by 
human or mechanical factors 
engineer trainee richard abramson 41 of trumbull conn and 
chief engineer willis copeland 53 of bethany conn gave 
accounts nearly identical to those they gave shortly after the 
crash coughlin said 
they both said that they began braking the train at the 
control signal at ruggles street and were not getting the braking 
action they expected said ntsb vice chairwoman susan m 
coughlin 
the apprentice engineer said that just before the derailment 
he applied emergency brakes the other engineer said he did not 
remember if the emergency brakes had been applied coughlin said 
the data tape confirmed that one of the engineers braked before 
the crash the tape indicates that the train slowed from 110 mph to 
77 mph in the one and onefifth mile before it derailed 
a brake application was recorded coughlin said 
she said more study would be required to determine if more 
than one brake application is recorded where the brakes were 
applied the amount of braking applied and how effective that 
braking was 
the socalled event recorder studied by amtrak indicated that 
the night owl an overnight train carrying 190 passengers reached 
a speed of about 110 mph somewhere in the 6380 feet between a 
signal at ruggles street in boston and the back bay station 
the speed limit drops from 100 mph to 30 mph at a point about a 
halfmile before the crash 
drug and alcohol tests for all crew members on both trains 
showed that no one had been drinking or using drugs 
the ntsb is about to begin testing of the brakes at the 
westinghouse air brake co plant in wilmerding pa where they 
were manufactured 
coughlin confirmed earlier reports that amtrak investigators had 
placed a tone on the tape to help them recover data but the tone 
inadvertently obliterated what was recorded for the last five miles 
of the trip 
investigators working through the weekend were able to recover 
some of the data but without corresponding times that particular 
events occurred 
the tape records such data as throttle position brake position 
speed and time but does not record conversations in the engine 
cab

the polish roman catholic church has for 
the first time ordered that sermons express sincere regret for 
antisemitism in the country 
in a pastoral letter released wednesday that is to be read at 
all sunday masses on jan 20 the church also emphasizes the 
multiple and diverse links between judaism and catholicism 
with no other religion does the church remain in such close 
relations with no other nation does it have so close ties the 
letter says 
nearly 95 percent of poles consider themselves catholic and the 
letter long awaited by international jewish groups and others 
concerned by resurgent antisemitism can be expected to have 
substantial impact 
in rural areas especially the parish church is the most 
influential force in daily life 
however the letter does not directly mention the current wave 
of antisemitism in poland and it also criticizes the image of 
polish antisemitism as an especially dangerous form 
speaking about the unprecedented extermination of jews one 
should not forget poles as a nation were among the first 
victims of this same criminal racist ideology of nazism the 
letter states 
for poles and jews the blood spilled together the 
horrendous suffering and harms experienced should not separate us 
but join us 
the pastoral letter was drafted by a church commission and 
approved by the council of bishops last month 
we express sincere regret about all instances of 
antisemitism which have ever taken place on polish soil the 
text states 
the letter highlights the teachings of polishborn pope john 
paul ii and his commentaries on judaism are also being published 
in book form so the churchs point of view is absolutely clear 
said jerzy turowicz editor of the catholic newspaper tygodnik 
powszechny and a member of the church commission 
the conservative polish church has fought assaults on polands 
independence through the centuries in part by emphasizing the 
national identity of poles not including the jews who have lived 
on polish soil since the 13th century and numbered 35 million 
before world war ii 
however the church has been criticized for not taking a 
stronger stand condemning antisemitism 
the pastoral teaching is a very significant event turowicz 
said in an interview it is actually the first document by the 
polish church on religious relations between judaism and 
christianity and the problem of antisemitism 
he said it is a paradoxical situation that antisemitism is 
resurfacing even though war purges and emigration have reduced the 
jewish population to a few thousand 
the letter comments on the stereotype that jews played a 
prominent role in the immediate postworld war ii communist 
government acknowledging some people of jewish origin did 
participate 
however we must recognize that the source of inspiration for 
their actions surely was not their origin nor even their religion 
but communist ideology from which jews themselves experienced much 
injustice it states 
in the recent presidential campaign antisemitic graffiti 
abounded and there were claims that prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki a devout catholic was jewish and his government 
jewishcontrolled 
presidentelect lech walesa publicly repudiated antisemitism 
frequently during the campaign but was criticized for not doing 
enough to suppress antisemitism among some of his supporters 
the letter calls for dialogue leading to the elimination of 
mistrust bias and stereotypes to better knowledge of one 
another and an understanding based on respect for different 
religious traditions

a former employee who accused hughes aircraft 
co in a 96 billion lawsuit of covering up flaws in millions of 
microchips installed in military systems has settled the case his 
attorney said 
but a hughes spokesman richard dore said wednesday the 
employee decided to drop the case after the company provided 
evidence that cracked chips were an industrywide problem and hughes 
had acted to correct it 
dore denied there had been a settlement with michael c 
denlinger a former engineer at hughes ground systems group who 
claimed hughes took a shortcut in its soldering methods on about 
47 million chips for five years in the 1980s 
denlinger had sought 32 billion in the socalled 
whistleblower federal lawsuit damages are automatically 
trebled under the civil false claims act 
there was a settlement but i cant disclose the terms said 
delingers lawyer william humphreys 
the suit was not dismissed on the merits of the case it was 
impossible for my client to continue because of the emotional and 
financial strain of a legal battle humphreys said 
dore said hughes part of general motors corp had been 
prepared to fight the lawsuit 
it got to the point where hughes was saying look theres 
nothing here that justifies his claims dore said we made 
that presentation to the court in november and delinger 
decided to drop the case at that point the case was dismissed 
early this month by us district court judge alicemarie stotler 
and hughes was notified late friday 
after a ninemonth investigation the justice department decided 
last february not to join denlingers lawsuit filed in june 1989 
denlinger had insisted at a news conference last year that he 
was pursuing the action for the public good 
our weapons systems have to be 100 percent reliable 
denlinger said in december 1989 if they fail at any critical 
moment disaster can happen lives can be lost 
denlingers suit was brought under federal law that allow 
citizens to seek damages on behalf of the government and share in 
them

a leading newspaper reported 
today that the government will announce plans to repeal major 
apartheid laws when parliament opens feb 1 
business day said president fw de klerk is expected to call 
for the scrapping of the group areas act which segregates 
neighborhoods by race and the land acts which reserve 87 percent 
of the countrys land for the white minority 
the newspaper which opposes apartheid and has good contacts 
with top officials said the government may propose alternative 
measures but they would be nondiscriminatory 
there was no immediate government comment on the report 
de klerk has promised changes in 1991 to the group areas act on 
neighborhood discrimination and other discriminatory laws but he 
has not specified a date or said whether the laws would be amended 
replaced with new legislation or scrapped 
antiapartheid groups have demanded the full repeal of the group 
areas act the land acts and the population registration act which 
classifies citizens by race 
the president has said the population registration act will be 
done away with only when a new constitution is negotiated with 
black opposition groups he hopes to begin such talks early next 
year with the african national congress and other antiapartheid 
parties 
any proposed changes would require the approval of parliament 
but de klerks governing national party controls the dominant white 
chamber of parliament parliamentary chambers for asians and people 
of mixed race would almost certainly approve such changes 
there is no chamber for blacks who account for about 30 million 
of the countrys 40 million people 
when opening parliament last february de klerk legalized more 
than 60 opposition groups agreed to free political prisoners 
including anc leader nelson mandela and pledged to dismantle the 
apartheid system of racial segregation 
the main institutions still legally segregated are 
neighborhoods public schools and the political system dozens of 
white public schools received permission to integrate in january 
after parents voted overwhelmingly to accept students of all races 
in another development large numbers of political exiles are 
expected to begin returning soon according to the rev frank 
chikane head of the national coordinating committee for the 
repatriation of exiles 
but chikane said the government still needs to complete 
negotiations with the united nations high commission for refugees 
and develop a simple process for the return of exiles 
de klerk on tuesday offered amnesty to anyone who had left the 
country illegally the move clears the way for the repatriation of 
most of the exiles estimated at up to 40000 
however exiles involved in the ancs guerrilla war against the 
government will have to make a separate application for amnesty 
those cases will be judged individually the anc which suspended 
its armed struggle in august says exiles should receive a blanket 
amnesty

eduard shevardnadze was little known in diplomatic 
circles when he was appointed to the highprofile foreign 
ministers job in 1985 
but at home in his native georgia he had a reputation as a 
hardworking crime buster who eliminated rampant corruption from the 
republics communist party 
president mikhail s gorbachev named shevardnadze foreign 
minister in july 1985 four months after coming to power himself 
the genial shevardnadze succeeded andrei gromyko or mr 
nyet the dourfaced tough negotiator who held the post for 28 
years 
the 62yearold shevardnadze who offered his resignation on 
thursday spent most of his career in the georgian communist party 
rising through the komsomol communist youth league and serving from 
19651972 as georgias interior minister he became the republics 
party leader in 1972 
like gorbachev shevardnadze is a pragmatist rather than an 
oldstyle hardline communist gorbachev recently credited him 
with helping develop the concept of perestroika while walking along 
a beach on the crimean peninsula 
we were walking and talking gorbachev said of their march 
11 1985 stroll we compared notes he said that everything was 
rotten through 
it was not easy for us to reach those conclusions gorbachev 
told the communist party newspaper pravda we had seen a lot 
especially considering that we had seen the war so we had seen a 
lot and knew a lot 
besides being respected at home shevardnadze has a good working 
relationship and frequently a warm personal relationship with 
his counterparts in the west 
although it was gorbachev who won the nobel peace prize this 
year the whitehaired shevardnadze did much of the leg work 
traveling the globe negotiating deep cuts in conventional and 
nuclear arms and paving the way for a series of superpower summits 
their foreign policy brought about an end to the cold war by 
permitting the unification of germany the return of democracy to 
eastern europe and closer relations with the united states 
they pulled soviet troops out of afghanistan and joined in the 
international condemnation of their once close ally iraq after it 
invaded kuwait 
shevardnadze made a real era in our international policies 
sergei stankevich moscows deputy mayor said in tribute thursday 
it was during his stint at the interior ministry that shevardnadze 
gained national attention 
georgians are notorious in the soviet union for corruption and 
shevardnadze who has a reputation for personal modesty played a 
key role in one of the republics most infamous cases of nepotism 
and bribery 
the case involved otari lazishvili who used a personal 
friendship with a former soviet general prosecutor to protect 
numerous illegal economic dealings 
as interior minister shevardnadze gradually and successfully 
moved against lazishvili in 1972 he was then made party boss and 
continued the crackdown 
author gail sheehy in her gorbachev biography the man who 
changed the world said shevardnadze became famous for exposing 
the underbelly of black marketeering with all the flair of a 
chicago crimebuster 
in 1978 shevardnadze was appointed a nonvoting member of the 
national communist partys politburo which until recent reforms 
wielded immense power over the governing of the country as well as 
the party in 1985 he was made a full member 
shevardnadzes wife nanuli is a former journalist

in recent years 
codenamed operation gambat the threeyear fbi undercover 
effort revealed alleged wrongdoing that included fixed murder 
cases us attorney general richard thornburgh announced 
wednesday 
i think the individual acts of corruption are appalling 
thornburgh said adding that more indictments are likely theres 
no mention of organized crime in the indictment but stay tuned 
the continuing investigation focuses on alleged violations in 
the citys first ward which includes chicagos downtown area us 
attorney fred foreman said

democratic organization and pasquale f de leo a lawyer 
in one of three separate indictments roti 70 and marcy 77 
were accused of fixing nonjury murder trials affecting zoning 
changes fixing other criminal and civil cases and judicial 
appointments 
you might say im concerned but i guess you have to learn to 
live with it and be strong said roti an alderman since 1969 who 
plans to run for reelection in february 
roti and marcy are accused of fixing a 1981 murder case and 
marcy alone was charged with fixing another in 1977 the presiding 
judges in those cases were not named 
marcys lawyer called the charges unsubstantiated 
in another indictment deleo 45 and shields 58 were charged 
with extortion making false statements and other crimes relating 
to a civil case staged by undercover agents in 1988 
deleo accepted 11000 from a lawyer working undercover for the 
fbi and delivered some of the money to shields purportedly to 
influence the judges decision the indictment said 
my client will persist in his plea of not guilty said 
deleos lawyer samuel banks 
attorney dan webb who represents shields and roti said im 
confident well be able to establish their innocence 
in the third indictment darco 46 was charged with two counts 
of extortion and one count of tax fraud the indictment charged him 
with taking a 7500 bribe from an fbi agent in exchange for 
support of insurance legislation and failing to report 5000 of 
that money on his 1988 tax return 
his lawyer jeffrey steinback said darco will plead innocent 
some evidence against darco shields and others came from 
secret tapes made by attorney robert j cooley a former policeman 
friendly with first ward democratic officials one indictment said 
if convicted marcy could be fined 35 million and sentenced to 
205 years in prison roti faces a possible 170year prison sentence 
and 275 million in fines shields could be fined 175 million 
and sentenced to 95 years in prison de leo faces a possible 125 
million fine and 85 years in prison darco could be fined 750000 
and sentenced to 43 years 
another undercover corruption investigation in chicago 
codenamed operation graylord has netted 70 convictions including 
15 judges since the mid1980s operation incubator resulted in a 
dozen convictions or guilty pleas including those of five city 
council members and a former aide to late mayor harld washington

american businesses plan to boost spending on 
plants and equipment just 04 percent in 1991 the smallest gain in 
investment in five years the government said today 
the commerce department said a survey conducted in october and 
november found businesses planning to spend 5242 billion for 
expansion and modernization the fifth consecutive year of 
increased business investment 
business investment actually declined 31 percent in 1986 
the survey found businesses planned to boost spending 41 
percent this year to 5221 billion that was down from a 51 
percent increase projected for 1990 in the previous survey last 
july and august 
in fact the quarterly surveys found projected spending slowing 
throughout the year as the economy grew more sluggish for 
instance the januarymarch survey found businesses planning to 
increase capital spending 81 percent 
still the 1990 investment would top the record 5016 billion 
spent on plants and equipment in 1989 when capital spending was 
boosted 104 percent over the previous year 
most economists ow believe the nation is in a recession and any 
increase in investment spending would be a stimulant to the 
economy 
in addition spending for business investment to replace aging 
plants and equipment and expand facilities helps to boost us 
productivity an increasingly important factor in view of the stiff 
competition the nation faces from overseas 
all of the figures have been adjusted for inflation 
before adjusting for inflation the survey projected a 24 
percent increase for all businesses in 1991 to 5467 billion 
after gains of 114 percent in 1989 and 110 percent in 1988 
it said the investment increase for all industries includes a 
46 percent gain for manufacturing firms and a 56 percent advance 
for companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing businesses 
manufacturers are projecting investsment spending of 1936 
billion the gain includes a 14 percent hike by industries making

police chief daryl f gates rebutted charges 
from a state agency that his department has denied hispanic 
officers promotions and maintained that a quota system would harm 
the forces quality 
if we were simply to put people in positions because they were 
of a specific background we would not be the kind of worldclass 
department we are gates said at a news conference wednesday 
gates made the comments in response to a complaint brought by 
the department of fair employment and housing on tuesday it 
alleged hispanic officers have been unfairly held back for a decade 
because of biased and inconsistent promotion procedures 
state agency lawyers said there was a great disproportion 
between the pool of qualified hispanic officers who have applied 
for promotions raises and choice assignments and those who have 
moved up the ranks 
gates denied the claims 
hispanic officers have the same kind of opportunities in this 
organization anyone has he said ask them what do they want 
me to do do they want me to hold their hand 
esteban lizardo a lawyer with the mexican american legal 
defense and educational fund responded angrily to gates comments 
i dont see how chief gates can say all is well lizardo 
said either he isnt looking at reality or he is confused about 
what is occurring within his department 
about 21 percent of the 8400officer police force is hispanic 
but most are concentrated in the lowest ranks only 10 percent of 
the captains are hispanic 
under terms of a federal discrimination lawsuit the department 
has been required for 10 years to boost recruitment of minorities 
and women 
the department maintains it has been meeting its recruitment 
goals for hispanics who make up about a third of the citys 
population

b1bs grounded after engine failures 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the strategic air command has 
grounded all 97 of its b1b bombers because of recurring engine 
failures 
sac commanderinchief gen john t chain jr today grounded 
the commands b1b fleet after two b1bs experienced catastrophic 
engine failures within a threemonth period sac said wednesday 
the command said it would return the bombers to full flying 
status as soon as possible no b1bs are based at offutt where 
sacs headquarters is located 
wednesdays action marks the fifth time in less than two years 
that the bomber fleet has been grounded 
chain ordered the planes grounded after a b1b engine failed 
wednesday while flying near dyess air force base texas 
on oct 4 an engine on a b1b from mcconnell air force base 
kan failed while the bomber was flying over southeastern 
colorado 
in both cases the airplanes landed safely and no one was 
injured b1bs have four engines 
sac said it suspects fan blades at the front of the engines were 
to blame for the failures after the october incident sac 
spokesmen said the fans failure caused the rest of the engine to 
be destroyed 
the grounding means that b1bs will be flown for no reason other 
than war the bombers will remain on nuclear alert at us air 
bases ready to launch if superpower tensions reach a crisis point 
b1bs have been certified for use in conventional bombing 
missions but sac still has not trained the bombers crews for 
anything other than its strategic nuclear mission 
sac used the word grounding in announcing the wednesdays 
action which is unusual in most cases the command says troubled 
planes have been ordered to stand down until all planes can be 
inspected 
a stand down is a more temporary step than grounding sac 
spokesmen have said in the past 
sac said chain ordered the planes grounded after discussions 
with gen charles c mcdonald commander of the air forces 
logistics command in ohio logistics command is working with the 
engines manufacturer general electric to solve the problem sac 
said 
b1bs are permanently based at ellsworth air force base sd 
grand forks air force base nd dyess and mcconnell 
previous groundings occurred in march 1989 for fuel tank 
problems in april 1989 for escape hatch problems after a crash at 
dyess in november 1989 and after an engine fell off one of the 
planes at dyess in october

ku klux klan members who plan a holiday 
weekend rally will have to leave their hoods at home the city 
council has ruled 
council members voted 54 wednesday in favor of an emergency 
ordinance banning hoods or masks in public despite arguments at an 
emotional meeting that the ban violates the klans right to free 
expression 
a klan leader said the the group will go ahead with the rally on 
fountain square and will sue the city in federal court challenging 
the ban on civil rights grounds 
the klansmen plan to wear their traditional robes and individual 
klan members will decide whether to wear hoods said ron lee vice 
president of the us knights of the ku klux klan 
maybe a few of us will go to jail i dont know lee said 
we just want to put christ back in christmas 
the klansmen have a permit to set up a 10foot wooden cross for 
one hour saturday morning and to present speakers at the rally the 
klansmen are not allowed to set the cross on fire 
a freelance artist and a gospel choir plan competing 
demonstrations on fountain square at the time of the klan rally a 
church also is planning a prayer vigil friday night 
we will peacefully convey to all in cincinnati the love of 
jesus christ for all races and our deep hurt at the 
misinterpretation of the meaning of the cross by the kkk said 
ray k nandyal a member of prince of peace lutheran church 
council members voted for the ban on hoods even after city 
lawyers councilman david mann and mayor charles luken argued that 
it violated first amendment guarantees of free expression 
i think this city can survive a onehour demonstration by a 
group that we all abhor mann said 
the measures sponsor councilman nick vehr said the ordinance 
was vital for public safety because it would let police identify 
lawbreakers vehr said it also showed the citys opposition to the 
klan and other white supremacy groups 
the maximum penalty for violating the ordinance is 30 days in 
jail and a 250 fine 
the state supreme court in georgia earlier this month upheld a 
39yearold ban on masks in rejecting an appeal from a klansman 
arrested for wearing his hood in public the justices said the 1951 
law does not violate freespeech rights and is a legitimate 
attempt to prevent violence and intimidation

friends home and placed under house arrest in his luxurious villa 
in the gulshan diplomatic enclave united press of bangladesh 
reported 
moudud was ordered held for 120 days under the special powers 
act which permits arrest without charges the law was used to 
confine ershad on dec 12 and an inquiry commission was appointed 
to investigate charges of corruption and abuse of power 
moudud was one of ershads closest advisers during the 
sevenweek campaign of street demonstrations and violent 
antigovernment protests that led to ershads ouster on dec 6 
he was the third important official of ershads government to be 
arrested police earlier jailed former deputy prime minister shah 
moazzem hossain and placed exhome minister mahmudul hassan under 
house arrest 
thirteen more former ministers and senior officials are being

free elections scheduled for feb 27 by painting walls with 
graffiti depicting the symbols of the main contending parties 
all previous bangladesh governments took power through coups and 
assassinations most of the elections called to legitimize any of 
these governments were marred by fraud and voterigging 
caretaker president shahabuddin ahmed who replaced ershad has 
promised a free and fair vote in the upcoming election of 300 
parliamentary seats he has prohibited anyone working in his 
transition government from running 
the main contenders are the awami league led by sheik hasina and 
the bangladesh nationalist party of khaleda zia both parties plan 
to contest all seats and each claims it can win a majority despite 
a profusion of more than 100 other parties 
it is not clear what role ershads jatiya party will play in the 
elections it has not been banned from participating but with the 
arrests of ershad and other party officials of the ousted 
government it may be difficult for the party to recoup

gov judd gregg has recommended creating a 
weekend holiday honoring the rev martin luther king jr but 
backers of a monday holiday see the proposal as an insult 
its a slap in the face for the governor to say that we need 
his permission to celebrate the holiday on a sunday rep lionel 
johnson head of the state chapter of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people said today 
gregg proposed a sunday holiday to end years of wrangling over a 
king observance 
the time has come for the state to put the issue of a martin 
luther king day behind us gregg said wednesday 
backers of a monday king holiday plan to introduce legislation 
for the legislative session that begins next month the federal 
government and all states except new hampshire arizona and montana 
observe a king holiday on the third monday in january 
the idea has failed repeatedly in the legislature and gregg 
said he continues to oppose a monday holiday on economic grounds 
gregg said another day off would be costly to municipalities and 
hurt new hampshires productivity in the increasingly competitive 
world economy 
creating another holiday in a workweek situation obviously 
undermines that he said

an israeli army helicopter crashed in 
south lebanon during the night injuring two airmen on board 
security sources said today 
israeli military sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said there was no crash but a difficult landing they said no 
crew members were injured and that they were brought back to israel 
by a rescue team 
the lebanese security sources said the aircraft plunged into a 
rocky ravine wednesday evening near the southern town of shebaa on 
the snowy slopes of mount hermon one source said the accident 
apparently was caused by poor visibility the area was covered 
with thick fog he said 
he said the israelis quickly sent two other helicopters that 
evacuated the wounded airmen neither report said how many airmen 
were aboard the copter 
shebaa is within israels selfproclaimed security zone in 
south lebanon stretching from the mediterranean coast in the west 
to the slopes of mount hermon in the east the buffer covers about 
440 square miles 
israel established the security zone in 1985 after withdrawing 
the bulk of its invading army that occupied the region for three 
years 
the strip policed by 1000 israeli soldiers and 3000 allied 
militiamen serves as a buffer against crossborder guerrilla 
infiltrations into northern israel 
helicopter gunships and air force jets often strike suspected 
guerrilla targets within the zone and farther north

caught between us pressure to boost its military 
posture and asian and domestic pressure not to japans government 
did both in the new fiveyear defense plan approved today by the 
cabinet 
on one hand the 171 billion program calls for tokyo to bear 
more of the costs of basing 50000 us soldiers in japan as part 
of the postwar security arrangement in response to us demands 
japan agreed to increase its share by 165 billion from 40 
percent to 50 percent 
at the same time the government slashed overall spending growth 
in the new defense budget to 3 percent annually from the more than 
5 percent over the past five years that was a response both to the 
lapsed soviet threat and renewed asian fears of a strong japanese 
military as well as powerful public opinion in japan against more 
defense spending government spokesmen said 
the soviet union was a potential threat for japan in the past 
but we now believe that has disappeared chief cabinet 
secretary misoji sakamoto said at a news conference 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said he hoped the new defense 
plan would be acceptable to asian nations china north and south 
korea and others alarmed by a government proposal to send japanese 
troops overseas had repeatedly urged japan to reconsider in recent 
months 
the government proposal to send troops to the persian gulf for 
noncombat roles under the un flag was defeated in parliament 
early last month a proposal to send nonmilitary personnel to aid 
gulf peacekeeping forces is being discussed 
critics charged that the first bill violated japans peace 
constitution under which the selfdefense forces should have no 
other mission than to repulse a limited smallscale foreign 
attack 
generally speaking this is a waitandsee budget said 
tomohisa sakanaka a leading defense expert at aoyama gakuin 
university after three years or so we can see what the 
postcold war situation may be 
at the same time the japanese government is not well prepared 
to think of japans future mission for example whether well have 
a united nations peacekeeping force or not 
asked whether the plan to divide the cost of maintaining us 
troops equally represents a formal usjapan agreement foreign 
ministry spokesman toshimitsu mori said appropriate coordination 
has already been made between us 
the japanus security treaty is the core of japans defense 
policy and therefore we will continue to increase our support for 
us troops in japan sakamoto said 
the us embassy had no comment on the fiveyear plan or the 
ongoing negotiations over burdensharing 
japan now pays about 3 billion annually to station us troops 
on its territory including many of the expenses for the 22000 
japanese base workers 
yendenominated salaries overtime pay and welfare expenses for 
japanese workers at us military bases have been covered by the 
us government but japan now has agreed to pay almost all 
expenses for those workers mori said 
essentially the new fiveyear plan cuts costs by keeping the 
number of japanese army soldiers at 153000 and reducing the amount 
of bigticket hardware purchased under the previous fiveyear 
buildup

moments after foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
stunned the kremlin today by announcing his resignation soviet 
political commentators began debating why he did it 
was it an emotional reaction to the rise of the more 
conservative forces in the nation was it part of some 
longbuilding disagreement with the military over the soviet 
unions increasingly independent foreign policy 
or was it as tass commentator andrei orlov wrote a clever 
ruse to somehow split the conservative forces and scare the 
reformers into giving president mikhail s gorbachev the support he 
needs to impose presidential rule 
whatever the reasons shevardnadzes departure represents a 
serious blow to gorbachev 
not only is he losing a shrewd diplomat who shaped soviet 
foreign policy on afghanistan and nuclear disarmament but also a 
key ally among reformers 
as another tass commentator put it gorbachev has so far been 
able to avoid open conflicts with the truly democratic wing in the 
soviet leadership in his middleoftheroad approaches to domestic 
and international problems 
the resignation comes at a critical time for gorbachev as he 
weighs taking harsh actions to hold the soviet union together amid 
a worsening economy against the need to preserve the democratic 
reforms that he has launched 
it also comes during the persian gulf crisis and less than two 
months before a summit with president bush to conclude a treaty to 
slash nuclear arsenals possibly a contentious issue among 
hardline military officers 
in this light shevardnadzes move could almost be seen as an 
act of disloyalty but this would be out of character for 
shevardnadze who was widely admired for his personal modesty 
integrity and above all unflagging loyalty to gorbachev a 
friendship that dates back to their teens 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said that in 
resigning shevardnadze wanted to add his deep feelings of 
respect and friendship for gorbachev 
shevardnadzes motive most likely is the most obvious 
possibility he wants to send a strong message to gorbachev and 
other reformers in the soviet union about the dangers of 
dictatorship and instability 
churkin let one hint fall when he told reporters that 
shevardnadze spent many sleepless nights before making the 
decision 
the minister believes that this move made by a man of his 
status and authority will become a serious warning to all that 
people will soberly and quietly look at themselves and the state of 
affairs churkin said only the people can prevent dictatorial 
elements from taking power 
tass noted that shevardnadze has spoken often in the past about 
the need for stability at home 
in his addresses to parliament and a number of interviews 
shevardnadze said repeatedly that economic weakness and mounting 
instability could reduce to naught all his countrys efforts on the 
international scene the tass commentary said 
in noting this tass said shevardnadze may have been influenced 
by wednesdays statement to the congress of peoples deputies by 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov who said perestroika as 
originally conceived has failed to materialize and not even a 
cabinet reshuffle would ensure its success 
the irony is that thousands of people in recent months have 
filled the streets calling for ryzhkovs resignation but he 
remains and it is shevardnadze who is stepping down

democrats say the white house is ignoring the 
fact that the nations population of drug addicts is bigger than 
ever as it touts a new survey that indicates a drop in casual use 
of cocaine 
while the household survey is dramatic proof that the reagan 
and bush administrations have succeeded in reducing casual use it 
is equally dramatic proof that they have failed terribly in 
reducing hardcore addiction said rep john conyers jr dmich 
we are fighting a twotiered drug war said conyers 
chairman of the house government operations committee the fact 
that daily cocaine use has risen not dropped indicates that only 
one drug war is being effectively fought the one for the educated 
and middleclass 
the drug strategy does not yet fight for our inner cities 
where addiction rates have gone up among poor people and 
minorities 
the household survey on drug abuse released wednesday found 
that current use of any illicit drug dropped 44 percent over the 
last five years from 23 million in 1985 to 129 million this year 
the survey also found a huge 72 percent drop in current use of 
cocaine the most virulent drug of the 1980s the number of current 
cocaine users fell from 58 million in 1985 to 16 million this 
year current use also called casual use means using a 
drug at least once a month 
the magnitude of the progress is impressive indeed 
president bush said at a news conference releasing the survey 
findings the news we have today suggests that our hard work is 
paying off and our national strategy is having an effect 
however there also was bad news 
the number of people who use cocaine daily or almost daily rose 
by 37 percent over five years from 246000 in 1985 to 336000 this 
year according to the survey sponsored by the national institute 
on drug abuse or nida 
the number of current crack cocaine users has remained stable 
the past two years at about a halfmillion and the survey 
undercounts them according to nida director charles r schuster 
while current use of any illicit drug fell during the past five 
years from 12 percent to 64 percent of all americans age 12 and 
above the rates remained higher among several groups young adults 
age 1825 years 149 percent the unemployed 14 percent blacks 
86 percent and people living in large metropolitan areas or 
living in the west both 73 percent 
officials also conceded that the surveys estimate of 48000 
current heroin users was inaccurate as nida has been saying for a 
decade that there are about a halfmillion heroin addicts 
even with such acknowledgments sen joseph r biden jr 
ddel chairman of the senate judiciary committee condemned the 
survey he said it misses more addicts than it counts 
a judiciary committee staff report estimates that 24 million 
people use cocaine at least once a week not the 662000 cited in 
the household survey the report also said the number of such 
cocaine users has increased by 200000 rather than declining by 
that number as the nida survey found 
as for heroin the judiciary committee staff report estimated 
there are some 940000 weekly heroin users not 500000 as the 
government says 
john p walters acting director of the office of national drug 
control policy said he realizes the household survey fails to 
check certain populations in which heavy drug use is assumed to 
be unusually concentrated 
those groups include homeless people as well as those in prison 
shelters drugtreatment centers and other institutions such as 
dormitories schuster estimated that as many as 50 percent of the 
more than 1 million people imprisoned nationwide were drug users 
in addition some 18 percent of the households contacted for the 
survey refused to participate said dr james o mason assistant 
secretary for health in the department of health and human 
services 
but mason said the surveys tracking of trends if not the 
precise numbers of users is accurate because the survey has been 
administered the same way all 10 times since 1971 he also said the 
findings are similar to those of other studies 
the survey interviewed 9259 people age 12 and older from march 
12 to june 20 interviews were conducted in person but respondents 
completed their own answer sheets to assure them that their 
responses would remain confidential and anonymous the report says 
some in the drug treatment community stressed that use of drugs 
in some areas continues unabated

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
announced his resignation thursday during a speech to parliament in 
which he defended his policies and spoke of a possible dictatorship 
in the country here are his remarks as translated by the 
associated press 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i have the briefest and most difficult speech in my life i 
didnt ask to take the floor but some of the deputies have 
insisted and i know the reasons this group insisted i speak and i 
have prepared the text of the speech and am giving it to the 
secretariat of the congress 
deputies can acquaint themselves with what has been done in the 
sphere of foreign policy by the leadership of the country the 
president and the foreign ministry and how the external conditions 
for development are shaping up for implementing our democratic 
reforms renewing the country for economic development etc 
something really has been accomplished and it is set forth in the 
speech 
i want to make a short statement consisting of two parts first 
yesterday there were speeches by some of our comrades these were 
our veterans they have raised the question of adopting a 
declaration forbidding the leadership and the president from 
sending troops to the persian gulf this was the approximate 
content of their speeches there were quite few such statements 
and speeches in the press on television i will be frank 
yesterdays statements were the last straw 
what is going on in the persian gulf in the long run i have had 
to speak on this subject and explain the policy of the soviet union 
in this country and outside this country more than 10 times this 
policy is very serious and very well thought out and conceived 
and corresponding to all the standards of civilized relations among 
states 
we have very good friendly relations with iraq that have been 
built for years and these relations are still preserved but we do 
not have any moral right to agree to the aggression by iraq to the 
annexation of a very small country that cannot defend itself then 
we would have crossed out everything that has been done in recent 
years by all our people in the sphere of establishing the 
principles of new political thinking thats the first point 
second i have explained more than once and gorbachev in his 
speech in the supreme soviet legislature mentioned the fact that 
the soviet leadership has no plans i dont know maybe there is 
some plan there is some group but some speakers say the 
minister of foreign affairs has plans to deploy troops to the 
persian gulf i have said that we have no plans they do not exist 
and no one is planning to send even one soldier even one 
representative of the armed forces of the ussr and this was 
stated 
again somebody needs this again this question this problem 
arises and i know that this arises in the lobby of the congress 
the third question yes i have said and i reaffirm it right 
now to everyone who is listening i state that if the interests of 
the soviet people suffer if even one person suffers no matter 
where it happens not only in iraq the soviet nation and the 
soviet government will defend the interests of its citizens and i 
think that in this respect the deputies should support the soviet 
leadership 
and i want to touch upon another question 
is all this accidental was the statement of two members of 
parliament accidental that it was possible to remove the interior 
minister and the time has come to settle accounts with the foreign 
minister this statement has gone around literally the entire world 
press and our newspapers are those fellows so brave i will say 
because my age allows me to because they are really too young 
with colonel epaulets to make such statements addressed to a 
minister addressed to a government member 
read newspapers i will not name any names today and what is 
surprising i think it requires serious thought who is behind 
those comrades and what is it why doesnt anyone refute them 
that there are no plans or maybe there are such plans for a 
coup 
in this connection allow me to say a few words about the 
personal dignity of an individual about the personal feelings 
because many people think that ministers who sit there or members 
or the government or the president or someone else that they were 
hired are hired and that they can treat them however they wish

i think that this is inadmissible in this connection i recall 
the party congress was it an accidental phenomenon or a real 
struggle that unfolded during the congress the sharpest struggle 
between reformers and i wont say conservatives i respect 
conservatives because they have their own views acceptable to 
society and reactionaries precisely reactionaries applause 
that battle i must say directly was won by progressive 
members delegates progressive delegates to the party congress 
was carried out with dignity 
against my will without consulting with me my name i my 
candidacy was entered in a secret ballot and 800 delegates voted 
against me what was this accidental or not accidental was it 
that the policies carried out by the foreign minister were no good 
or did his personality fail to suit someone its a serious 
question a more than serious question 
i think in fact this phenomenon is not accidental i 
apologize but i am recollecting now the supreme soviet session on 
supreme soviet chairman comrade anatoly lukyanovs initiative 
just before the beginning of the session a serious question was 
included into the agenda on treaties with the german democratic 
republic 
i happened to be away and my deputies were called in and they 
were put in a foolish situation and the discussion of the 
question failed i had to speak the next week and what happened 
was that the same people who are now acting as authors leveled 
serious charges that the foreign minister made onesided 
concessions over the treaty that he is incompetent illiterate 
etc etc 
there was not a single person including the chairman who would 
respond and say that it is not fair its persecution all kinds of 
publications appear and what expressions away with the gorbachev 
clique they also add shevardnadze and several other names 
i was shaken i will say it directly by the events of the first 
day the beginning of the work of our congress the pushing of a 
voting button decided not only the fate of the president but 
also perestroika democracy is it normal 
comrade democrats in the broadest sense of the word you have 
scattered reformers have gone and hidden in the bushes 
dictatorship is coming i say this with all responsibility no one 
knows what kind of dictatorship it will be and who will come 
what kind of dictator and what kind of system 
i want to make the following statement i am resigning dont 
react and dont curse me let it be my contribution protest if you 
will against dictatorship i express my great gratitude to mikhail 
sergeyevich gorbachev i am his friend i think as he does i have 
always supported and will until the last day support the ideas of 
perestroika the idea of renewal the ideas of democratization we 
have done great work in the international area but i think that it 
is my duty as a person a citizen as a communist i cannot accept 
those events that are happening in our country or accept those 
trials that are in store for our people 
and still i think the dictatorship will not come to pass the 
future belongs to democracy and freedom 
thankyou very much

the newly elected parliament of the united germany 
convened for the first time today and began the challenging task of 
forging a common future for two distinct societies 
the 662 members of the bundestag the policy making lower house 
held their inaugural session in berlins reichstag building the 
historic seat of german legislatures 
lawmakers however will return to the seat of government in 
bonn for subsequent meetings they eventually will decide whether 
to move permanently to berlin the new nations symbolic capital 
the first session was opened by willy brandt former chancellor 
and veteran politician the guests of honor included italian 
president francesco cossiga 
the lawmakers were elected by germans from both east and west on 
dec 2 the culmination of a series of milestones that began with 
former east germanys peaceful revolt against its communist 
government 
the first session may indicate whether the legislators from 
former east germany will act as a single voting bloc on behalf of 
eastern germany even though they are affiliated with different 
political parties 
lawmaker wolfgang thierse who prior to unification and the 
december elections led the social democrat faction in the first 
freely elected east german parliament said he hopes the east 
german legislators will vote as one bloc 
its going to be more difficult for us to stay in the 
picture thierse said theres going to be a perception were 
not as intelligent not as politically clever and that doesnt 
wash 
we have to keep our interests alive we have to treat these 
new five states that east germany has become as a single land 
well have to be united by common interests and common problems of 
the five new states he said 
thierses social democrats are the main opposition to the 
conservative christian democrats of chancellor helmut kohl 
among the eastern germans who took a seat in parliament today is 
lothar de maiziere the christian democrat who was the first and 
last freely chosen leader of east germany 
de maiziere resigned from kohls cabinet this week amid 
allegations that he may hve been an informant for the communist 
secret police de maiziere has denied the allegations 
thierse said such stigmas will be east germanys legacy for many 
years he said western germans still dont understand the society 
they have absorbed 
we must not bring some abstract morality to this past but a 
sense of reallife history as it was he said 
thierse who worked in the culture ministry under the former 
regime said most east germans did not fight the old system or work 
closely with it most merely adapted to it

the missouri supreme court today turned 
down a request to resume food and water for nancy cruzan while 
demonstrators camped on a hospitals steps to protest removal of 
the comatose womans feeding tube 
the court rejected a plea by an antieuthanasia group that state 
officials be forced to provide nourishment to ms cruzan whose 
condition was deteriorating six days after the tube was removed 
the courts twosentence order issued at jefferson city was 
signed by judge edward robertson he wrote the courts november 
1988 decision that denied a request by ms cruzans family to halt 
her food and water 
that 1988 ruling sent the case to the us supreme court which 
ruled in june in its first righttodie case that missouri could 
require clear and convincing evidence that ms cruzan would 
want to die 
the request to resume feeding was filed by attorney mario 
mandina of lawyers for life it listed a kansas city woman yvette 
williams as the plaintiff 
nancy can receive love from what ive been told she responds 
to her nurses she can follow people with her eyes i care for four 
kids who cant track people with their eyes that does not mean we 
should kill them said ms williams a 27yearold graphic artist 
who works parttime at a mental retardation center she was quoted 
in the joplin globe today 
joining her quest this morning was randall terry founder of the 
antiabortion group operation rescue he arrived at the 
rehabilitation hospital and was trying to meet with ms cruzans 
parents a spokesman said 
joe and joyce cruzan will not meet with terry their lawyer 
attorney william colby said 
there is enough pain from the auto accident that to compound 
that by having a group of strangers who never knew nancy 
interfering with the medical decisions is inappropriate the 
lawyer said 
the cruzans contend their 33yearold daughter would not want to 
live in the persistent vegetative state she has experienced since a 
1983 car accident 
after the us supreme court set the standard of clear and 
convincing evidence the cruzans went back to local court there 
three of ms cruzans coworkers testified they had talked about 
such a situation and ms cruzan had indicated she would want to 
die 
probate judge charles teel ruled friday sufficient evidence 
existed to allow the tube to be removed 
ms cruzans condition went from stable to deteriorating on 
wednesday rehabilitation center spokeswoman barbara shoun said 
doctors expected her to live a week or two after the tube was 
removed friday 
about a dozen people wrapped in thin blankets and sleeping 
bags camped out overnight on the state hospital steps in this 
southwest missouri town 
were calling upon people from around the country to come and 
camp out and stand with nancy cruzan at the hour of her death 
said the rev matt trewhella a minister from milwaukee 
police banned demonstrators from the building after 10 of them 
refused to leave the directors office and a hallway wednesday 
they flopped out on the ground and refused to move so police 
pushed them out the main entrance in wheelchairs mrs shoun said 
no one was arrested 
about 25 to 30 police officers patrolled the rehabilitation 
center and stood guard outside ms cruzans secondfloor room 
authorities said 
nineteen people arrested tuesday for trespassing and illegal 
assembly remained jailed on 1000 bond each all assumed the name 
nancy cruzan and police said they could not post bail until they 
gave their real names all but one was fasting

a temporary ban has been placed on siberian 
log imports because of the threat of introducing agricultural pests 
into the united states the agricultural department said today 
the soviet union first shipped siberian logs to the united 
states last summer under tightly controlled test conditions said 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service 
we inspected the logs upon entry and found two potentially 
harmful pests he said since then we have learned that 
siberian raw wood can harbor over 100 organisms not native to the 
united states 
based on these findings glosser said further imports of the 
logs will be put off until more information is available 
glosser said the duration of the ban will depend on the results 
of a risk assessment which will examine the possible pest hazards 
of siberian log imports to us agriculture 
we are currently working with regulatory and forestry 
officials from oregon california and washington usdas forest 
service and the timber industry to gather and examine available 
data on siberian logs he said 
after the assessment is completed in early 1991 glosser said 
agency officials will evaluate the need for developing regulations 
to restrict or prohibit the entry of siberian logs

respect for human rights but this has to be done in a way that 
maintains order without sacrificing democratic principles us 
gen john r galvin natos military commander in europe 
 
we can only hope that the reforms are carried out they are 
good for the soviet union and they are good for the relationship 
between our people and for developments in europe german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
 
a lot was lost with his departure former hungarian 
foreign minister gyula horn 
 
i hope that this cry of alarm will be heard it will serve 
as a warning to western countries and others who are dragging their 
feet over aid which must be given french foreign minister 
roland dumas 
 
this appeal is more urgent than ever before german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
 
the resignation is certainly a sign of the great tension

a court cquitted four men of fraud 
after a 33year trial that cost the state more than 130 times the 
amount the men were accused of appropriating newspapers reported 
thursday 
this trial is the biggest waste of public time and money 
judge vb gupta was quoted as saying wednesday in the hindu daily 
news reports said the case was the longest criminal trial ever 
recorded in india 
indias judicial system is well known for its slowness civil 
suits can sometimes drag on for decades and all courts including 
the supreme court have a backlog of hundreds of cases 
the trial began in 1957 two years after four employees of a 
staterun transport company were accused of buying spurious motor 
parts which led to a loss by the company of some 4500 
one of the acquitted men jm kochar is now 82 and was the 
general manager of the nowdefunct madhya bharat roadways his 
codefendants were r m banthiya 71 a former store manager and 
sn murteja 62 and jk batra 63 former storekeepers in the 
company 
the newspaper quoted judge gupta as saying the prosecution 
failed to prove the fraud charges despite the 33 years of hearings 
he said over the years the cost of the trial mounted to a total of 
588235 
here is a case where the mighty state with all the enormous 
resourceshas fought this case for more than three decades 
against the aged citizens who have already suffered much more 
punishment than deserved even if the present case would have 
resulted in conviction gupta said 
as the trial dragged on only 12 of the 64 witnesses cited by 
the prosecution ever testified and 16 others died the newspaper

economics minister david magen said thursday he 
has won wide government backing for a plan under which tens of 
thousands of palestinians would lose their jobs in israel 
there are now 108000 palestinians from the occupied lands 
working in israel under magens plan nearly twothirds of them 
would lose their jobs 
the plan is designed to free jobs for soviet jewish immigrants 
and cut the number of palestinians coming to israel at a time of 
increased arab attacks on jews said magen adviser eldad halachmi 
such attacks have been urged by leaders of the palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip last week three jews were stabbed to death inside an 
israeli factory and the moslem fundamentalist group hamas claimed 
responsibility 
employers now prefer jewish workers instead of arabs because 
of the recent violence there is a lot of apprehension and fear 
said yossi ahimeir a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
magens plan calls for strict enforcement of labor laws that 
have been ignored in the past requiring israeli businesses to 
employ only arabs with work permits and pay them the minimum wage 
some palestinians hailed the plan as a first step toward 
economic autonomy from israel but others warned that it would 
spell disaster for the occupied lands 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza observed a general strike 
thursday called by proplo uprising leaders to protest the 
judaization of jerusalem the settlement of jews in the eastern 
arab part of the city captured in the 1967 war 
in a related development three leftwing legislators alleged 
the government was funneling million of dollars to jewish settlers 
seeking to buy property in the moslem quarter of jerusalems old 
city the jerusalem post reported 
the legislators asked for a halt to the transfers until it was 
determined if they were legal 
the old city is part of east jerusalem which israel annexed 
after its capture from jordan western countries do not recognize 
israels sovereignty over the area and the united states has 
recently demanded that us aid not be used to settle immigrants in 
east jerusalem 
of the 108000 palestinians working at menial jobs in israeli 
construction manufacturing and agriculture about 70000 dont 
have work permits 
it is unlikely israelis will continue to employ as many arabs if 
they must have work permits meaning they must receive the minimum 
wage and such benefits as pensions and health insurance 
an interministerial committee headed by magens office 
recommended raising fines for employers from 250 to 1000 for 
each violation of labor laws along with an extra fine of 450 for 
each day an illegal worker is employed halachmi said 
magen told israel radio on thursday that the plan won approval 
this week from all ministries involved it now has to go to the 
cabinet for formal approval 
magen said he expected about 60000 palestinians to lose their 
jobs as a result of the new restrictions 
palestinian economist fawaz abu sitta said layoffs would have 
disastrous consequences in the impoverished gaza strip where 70 
percent of the 750000 people are refugees 
about 65000 gazans or half the local labor force are employed 
in israel including 40000 working without permits abu sitta 
said 
there is little chance that those fired will find new jobs in 
gaza he said 
abu sitta said several gaza laborers have reported being turned 
away at an army checkpoint at the entrance to israel in recent days 
after they could not produce work permits 
the situation in the west bank is only slightly better than in 
gaza palestinians have charged that israel has systematically 
hampered economic development in both territories to safeguard a 
pool of cheap arab labor and create a captive market for israeli 
goods 
palestinian journalist daoud kuttab said the magen plan was a 
positive step toward palestinian autonomy 
it might be a bit too quick and its going to cause a lot of 
hardship but its going to lead to economic separation which we 
hope will be at the forefront of a political separation he said

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze resigned 
without warning today telling parliament that a reactionary 
resurgence threatened the soviet union with dictatorship president 
mikhail s gorbachev said he was stunned by the resignation of his 
longtime ally 
dictatorship is coming shevardnadze told the parliament 
his voice choked with emotion no one knows what kind of 
dictatorship it will be what kind of dictator will come and what 
order things will take 
hardliners have been pushing gorbachev to declare a state of 
emergency in troubled areas of the country and he is asking the 
congress of peoples deputies legislature to amend the constitution 
to further strengthen his power 
gorbachev took the podium hours later and said that before the 
resignation he had planned to make shevardnadze his vice president 
under a government reorganization that would put more power under 
presidential control he did not say whether he still considered 
shevardnadze for the job 
speaking slowly and calmly gorbachev said i dont want 
either to simplify the situation or overdramatize it the main 
thing is not to fall into panic or even worse hysteria 
i personally condemn shevardnadze for abandoning the 
perestroika reform program during a difficult time the soviet 
president said 
gorbachev said he knew nothing about any attempt to establish a 
dictatorship but told deputies such a condition could arise if the 
country continued to sink into disorder 
immediately after gorbachev spoke parliamentarians voted 
154052 with 11 abstentions to ask shevardnadze to stay in the 
job gorbachev said he had spoken with shevardnadze shortly after 
his speech to persuade him not to quit 
but foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said the 
resignation was irreversible he said shevardnadze would remain 
in the job until the congress session ends next week when a new 
foreign minister would be chosen 
there was immediate speculation that deputy foreign minister 
yevgeny primakov an arab speciaist who has been gorbachevs 
personal envoy to the persian gulf was a possible successor 
us secretary of state james a baker iii who had forged a 
close working relationship with shevardnadze on issues ranging from 
arms control to the gulf crisis said he forsaw no change in us 
and soviet relations 
baker also warmly praised shevardnadze 
on a personal note let me state that ive known eduard 
shevardnadze to be a man of his word a man of courage conviction 
and principle the secretary of state said during a news 
conference at the state department 
im convinced that he is committed to peaceful reform 
political and economic in the soviet union 
and im also convinced that the dramatic moves toward 
democratization and freedom in central and eastern europe and the 
new thinking in soviet foreign policy would never have happened 
without his and president gorbachevs courageous leadership 
shevardnadze was to have participated in a feb 1113 summit on 
arms control and other issues with the united states in moscow 
shevardnadzes resignation also provoked concern around the 
world over the future course of the soviet union and gorbachevs 
reforms 
germany and france in particular appealed urgently for an 
international effort to bolster gorbachevs reform program with 
financial aid 
shevardnadzes unexpected announcement could deal a serious blow 
to gorbachev who has been asking for stronger powers to keep his 
ethnically diverse nation together and make the daunting transition 
to a market economy 
shevardnadze waving his finger at lawmakers blamed what he 
called reactionary forces for pushing the president to take 
dictatorial steps but he also implied gorbachev was acceding to 
their demands 
the whitehaired georgian and second most visible figure in 
soviet politics decried the influence of hardline lawmakers with 
colonels shoulderstripes in the congress the countrys highest 
legislative body 
i express my great gratitude to mikhail sergeyevich 
gorbachev he said i am his friend i think as he does i have 
always supported and will until my last day support the ideas of 
perestroika the idea of renewal the ideas of democratization 
but i think that resignation is my duty as a person a 
citizen a communist he said declaring that the future 
belongs to democracy and freedom 
gorbachev has asked the congress to streamline the executive 
branch to replace the council of ministers with several bodies 
under direct presidential control he also has said stronger 
emergency steps may be needed earlier this year he received 
sweeping emergency powers to ensure economic reform 
but shevardnadze giving what he called one of the shortest 
and saddest speeches of my life urged congress not to approve 
measures that he said would give gorbachev dictatorial rights 
when you push the voting button you decide the fate not 
only of gorbachev but of perestroika and democracy shevardnadze 
said 
shevardnadze 62 played an integral role in revolutionizing 
soviet foreign policy since being appointed in 1985 by gorbachev 
who this year won the nobel peace prize for his policy successes 
abroad 
shevardnadze was named foreign minister four months after 
gorbachev became communist party chief in march 1985 he helped 
steer soviet foreign policy away from confrontation and conquest in 
favor of appeasement and coexistence 
under shevardnadze the soviet union pulled out of afghanistan 
and began negotiating huge cuts in nuclear weapons stockpiles it 
also let east european countries oust hardline communist leaders 
without soviet intervention and reversed antagonistic relations 
with most cold war enemies 
but the new thinking policy long resisted by hardliners in 
government has come under attack in recent weeks by rightwing 
lawmakers opposed to soviet involvement in the gulf 
shevardnadze repeated that the government would not send soviet 
soldiers to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait which it invaded on 
aug 2 
hardline members of congress have urged gorbachev to declare 
emergency rule in unstable republics and the soviet leader has 
said he would not hesitate to do so 
in his speech shevardnadze said sardonically that hardliners 
have been able to remove the interior minister and now its time 
to settle scores with the foreign minister the official tass 
news agency reported 
the interior minister was replaced earlier this month with a 
former kgb officer after hardline deputies demanded he be replaced 
for not cracking down hard enough on independence movements

twentyeight french masterpieces seized by the 
nazis during world war ii including paintings by monet renoir and 
gauguin have been found in a cupboard at a berlin museum a news 
magazine reported thursday 
this weeks cover story in lexpress described how the works 
seized from private citizens between 19421944 have been locked 
away since 1972 their existence known to only a handful of people 
according to the magazine the department of french national 
museums learned the works existed in 1975 but was not interested 
because the works did not come from national collections 
never did the prestigious department think of consulting its 
experts or glancing through the catalogues of the artists in 
question lexpress wrote 
the paintings included claude monets route effet dhiver 
soleil couchant road effect sunset eugene delacroixs 
jeune homme young man auguste renoirs coco ecrivant coco 
writing and paul gauguins la falaise the cliff they 
were examined by lexpress reporters who said they were in 
excellent condition 
sylvie poujade a french museum spokeswoman told the associated 
press her department learned of the paintings existence a month 
ago when contacted by lexpress reporters 
we searched our archives and did not find proof that the 
department had ever received a list of works from berlin ms 
poujade said 
ms poujade said that french museums are considered 
depositories of state property which they are expected to 
conseve and display in good condition 
our role is not to track down or recuperate art works not 
considered state property thats the job of other government 
offices she said 
the magazine quoted lothar brauner curator at the 
nationalgalerie in formerly east berlin as saying he received the 
works on may 19 1972 from an unidentified person claiming to have 
gotten them from a third party 
a legal document drawn up that day shows that the person wished 
to hand over the paintings so that they would be properly 
preserved until being returned to their rightful owners 
brauner said he did not know who the rightful owners were 
according to lexpress french museum authorities were informed 
the works were in berlin by the french foreign affairs ministry 
itself contacted by east german authorities 
lexpress recounted how brauner and his wife a restoration 
expert locked the paintings in a yellow wooden armoire and 
equipped it with a pail of water and a hydrometer to measure the 
humidity from time to time they would take out the paintings and 
check their condition the magazine wrote 
during the war the nazis sought to amass as much art as 
possible to fulfill hitlers dream of creating a european arts 
center in his native linz austria several of his aides including 
martin bormann and hermann goring were also art collectors and 
rerouted much of the booty into their own hands 
in july 1944 the nazi partys art unit drew up an inventory of 
21903 art works confiscated since 1940 
however the list did not include the thousands of paintings by 
matisse chagall picasso and leger and others considered 
degenerate or too jewish and which were either sold to 
unscrupulous french and swiss art dealers or destroyed 
lexpress wrote the jeu de paume museum in paris once the 
temple of impressionist art was used to stockpile seized art 
works 
on may 27 1943 its interior courtyard was the scene of a giant 
bonfire in which some 500 paintings by andre masson joan miro 
paul klee max ernst and others went up in smoke as nazi chief 
alfred rosenberg and armed guards looked on 
the magazine also described how the gestapo got its hands on 
millions of dollars worth of art works following tips from french 
police 
based on months of investigative reporting the magazine accused 
the collaborationist vichy government of expecting to profit 
financially from selling the property confiscated from french jews 
who were later deported to concentration camps

today soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadzes abrupt 
resignation does not mean a change in soviet foreign policy 
he paid tribute to shevardnadzes professionalism and said 
im going to miss him 
white house press secretary marvin fitzwater called shevardnadze 
an important figure in the positive evolution of ussoviet 
relations and expressed hopes for the relationship to continue 
baker speaking to reporters hours after the surprise 
announcement by his soviet counterpart said he was pleased to have 
president mikhail s gorbachevs assurance that foreign policy 
which has brought recent progress toward peace and disarmament 
would continue on course 
baker reacting cautiously said he would not characterize the 
resignation as a sign that gorbachevs reforms are coming 
unraveled he added he had received no clue in his recent meeting 
with shevardnadze that his negotiating partner was considering 
quitting 
in my experience minister shevardnadze has always worked as a 
professional who has served his countrys interest baker said 
shevardnadze was a driving force in the kremlins new thinking 
abroad and democratization at home he added 
i am proud to call this man a friend he said adding that 
he had always found his soviet counterpart a man of his word of 
courage and conviction 
baker reiterated in response to questions that he does not 
anticipate any change in policy particularly in the persian gulf 
where the united states is counting on soviet backing of the united 
nations resolution approving use of force if iraq fails to withdraw 
from kuwait by jan 15 
this is clearly a critical time for the process of political 
and economic reform in the ussr president bush emphasized our 
commitment to this process just a few days ago when he expressed 
his concern that democratization continue fitzwater said 
minister shevardnadze has been an important figure in the 
positive evolution of ussoviet relations over the past few 
years we have every reason to want to see that process continue 
acknowledging his surprise baker said he was not notified in 
advance of shevardnadzes decision announced in a brief 
statement to the soviet congress of peoples deputies in moscow 
while being careful not to say anything that could be 
interpreted as interference in soviet domestic affairs baker 
indicated his personal disappointment at the loss of a man with 
whom he has conducted intensive negotiations for nearly two years 
i think that we achieved some significant things in the 23 
months that we were able to work together the secretary said 
fitzwater said the us government had no advance notice of 
shevardnadzes decision and the white house had not had any direct 
discussions with soviet authorities 
baker and shevardnadze working with european negotiators 
concluded the recently signed agreement to reduce conventional 
forces in europe they are reported near accord on a treaty to cut 
longrange nuclear arsenals by 30 percent a measure bush hopes to 
sign at his next summit meeting with gorbachev scheduled to take 
place feb 1113 in the soviet union

conflicts around the world including the persian gulf

greater efforts to reduce the estimated 250 million cases of 
sexually transmitted infections that occur each year

health problem and may lead to sterility infertility

the united states declining to shield its 
israeli ally on thursday supported a security council resolution 
deploring israels deportation of palestinians and calling for un 
monitoring of their safety 
the vote was unanimous among the 15member council 
in a separate nonbinding statement the council agreed a 
properly timed and structured international conference should be 
held to facilitate a lasting peace in the arabisraeli conflict 
the separate statement was issued by this months council 
president yemen 
the statement also said the arabisraeli conflict is unique and 
must be addressed independently on its own merits an indirect way 
of saying there must not be linkage to the persian gulf crisis 
the us vote was seen as an effort to reinforce arab commitment 
to the usled multinational coalition arrayed against iraq a 
us veto on an issue considered vital to arabs could have 
undermined their confidence in the us mission diplomats said 
it was the third time in more than two months that the united 
states declined to shield israel from international criticism by 
exercising its right of veto as a permanent council member in the 
past the united states frequently has blocked council efforts to 
condemn israel 
the council action had been bogged down for about two months as 
the united states sought to ensure that there was no linkage 
between the arabisraeli conflict and a settlement of the gulf 
crisis 
the separate nonbinding statement was a compromise intended to 
keep the two issues apart 
president saddam hussein of iraq has tried to link the israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied west bank and gaza strip to his 
withdrawal from kuwait

the justice department refused thursday to 
transfer convicted terrorist silvia baraldini to a prison in her 
native italy because she is likely to be paroled there from her 
43year us sentence 
the department informed italy by letter of its refusal to 
transfer baraldini to an italian prison under an international 
convention that allows sentenced criminals to serve time in their 
native country 
assistant attorney general robert s mueller iii said in the 
letter that baraldinis sentence for conspiring to commit a series 
of terrorist acts in the united states would be considerably if it 
fell under italian law 
the serious and violent nature of the crimes committed by ms 
baraldini in our view demand a sentence commensurate with those 
imposed by the courts in the united states mueller said the 
justice department wants to ensure baraldini serves a long sentence 
because we believe that if released ms baraldini would 
continue in criminal activities detrimental to the united states 
mueller also expressed concern over italian parole policies that 
have allowed convicted terrorists and organized crime figures to 
be furloughed or placed on work release after only relatively short 
periods of incarceration 
italy requested a justice department review of baraldinis case 
under the international convention on the transfer of sentenced 
prisoners baraldini who came to this country at age 13 retains 
italian citizenship 
she was convicted in 1983 of being part of a conspiracy by 
leftwing terrorists to rob armored cars including a 1981 holdup 
of a brinks truck near nyack ny that resulted in the death of a 
guard and two policemen 
baraldini was also convicted of racketeering for her 
participation in the 1980 armed robbery of an armored truck and the 
1979 kidnaping of prison guards to help convicted murderer joanne 
chesimard escape from a new jersey prison 
baraldini was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment and later 
received a threeyear term for criminal contempt because she 
refused to answer questions to a grand jury investigating leftwing 
terrorism 
the justice department said that it had information baraldini 
was still in communication with fellow members of the terrorist may 
19th organization and would assist them if released from prison 
muellers letter said authorities also had information 
indicating that baraldini may have participated in a series of 
bombings in new york and chicago by the faln a puerto rican 
separatist group 
these bombings included a 1975 blast that killed four people in 
new york the department said 
mueller said the justice department might reconsider its 
decision if baraldini expressed remorse for her crimes and 
cooperated with investigations of terrorist fugitives 
alternatively if we could be assured ms baraldini would 
serve a sentence in italy equivalent to that imposed by the judges 
here we would of course reconsider this decision mueller 
said 
baraldini is being held at the marianna federal correctional 
institution in marianna fla

republican who ran as an independent 
his previous administration spanning 1975 to 1984 was marked 
by widespread corruption 
lawyers argued the case before the high court monday 
frederick cass a lawyer for those who had challenged ciancis 
right to hold office said he would not pursue the matter further 
there is no next step cass said 
although ciancis lawyers had threatened to take the matter to 
federal court if he lost cass said state issues were involved and 
he saw no federal jurisdiction 
cianci who was forced from office in 1984 by a felony assault 
conviction won the nov 6 election by 317 votes over two 
challengers 
two groups of citizens challenged ciancis right to hold office 
under a 1986 state constitutional amendment that prohibits felons 
from running for office until three years after they have finished 
their sentences 
cianci pleaded no contest to charges he used an ashtray and a 
fireplace log to assault a man he suspected was having an affair 
with his estranged wife cianci was given five years probation 
his challengers asserted that meant he could not run for office 
until 1992 
ciancis lawyers argued that the constitutional amendment could 
not be applied to past convictions in rhode island a nocontest 
plea is considered a conviction

foreign minister eduard shevardnadze defended 
himself against conservative criticism of his foreign policy in his 
resignation speech thursday denying that he planned to send soviet 
troops to the persian gulf 
no one is planning to send there even one soldier even one 
representative of the armed forces of the ussr shevardnadze 
said 
but he said that if the interests of the soviet people suffer 
if even one person suffers no matter where it happens not only in 
iraq the soviet nation and the soviet government will defend the 
interests of its citizens 
the soviet union has been highly critical of the aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait by iraq a close kremlin ally and has supported a 
ussponsored united nations resolution allowing the use of force 
if baghdad does not pull out by jan 15 the cooperation between 
the superpowers has been closer than on any other issues since 
world war ii 
the kremlin however has refused to send its own forces to the 
gulf 
a foreign ministry spokesman said the current soviet policy on 
the gulf responds to the interests of our people and said he 
hoped it would not change under shevardnadzes successor 
in his resignation speech to the congress of peoples deputies 
shevardnadze bristled and appeared exasperated at suggestions that 
lawmakers adopt a resolution forbidding the leadership from sending 
troops to the gulf labeling such calls the last straw 
some of the speakers say that the minister of foreign affairs 
has plans to deploy troops to the persian gulf shevardnadze 
said i have explained i have said that we have no plans they 
do not exist 
again somebody needs this explanation again this question 
this problem arises and i know it will arise in the lobby of the 
congress he said 
shevardnadze said the soviet union has very good friendly 
relations with iraq which have been built for years and these 
relations are still preserved but we do not have any moral right 
to agree to the aggression by iraq to the annexation of a very 
small country which cannot defend itself 
then we would have crossed out everything that has been done 
in recent years by all our people in the sphere of establishing the 
principles of new political thinking he said 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin speaking later 
thursday said shevardnadze believed the foreign policy enacted in 
the name of president mikhail s gorbachev would continue under the 
next foreign minister 
asked about the gulf policy churkin said that the foreign 
ministry was convinced that this course this policy responds to 
the interests of our people 
we hope that this main orientation will not be changed and i 
would like to stress that the guarantee of this is that this policy 
is associated first of all with the name of our president mikhail 
gorbachev churkin said 
asked whether there would be any changes in soviet policy toward 
washington and februarys scheduled summit churkin underscored 
shevardnadzes contributions in establishing good relations with 
the united states 
we would wish that this steady process of enlargement and 
improvement in our relations with the united states should 
continue and develop he said

president bush told members of congress today 
saddam hussein must be made to realize hes going to get his ass 
kicked if the united states goes to war against iraq a lawmaker 
said 
emerging from a white house meeting rep elton gallegly 
rcalif quoted bush as saying he was convinced the iraqi leader 
does not understand what he is up against 
the greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed 
confrontation is to make sure that saddam hussein be made really 
aware that to quote him bush that if we get into an armed 
situation hes going to get his ass kicked gallegly said 
bushs remark was confirmed by another person at the meeting 
the president met with a delegation of lawmakers just back from 
the persian gulf 
rep anthony c beilenson dcalif said military commanders 
told them they were able to do the job if asked to to drive 
iraq out of kuwait with force 
but nobody was suggesting over there i think that it could be 
done terribly quickly or terribly easily or that there wouldnt be 
some casualties the congressman said 
meanwhile the white house joined the pentagon in trying to 
blunt a generals warning that us ground troops in the persian 
gulf might not be ready to fight iraq by the jan 15 deadline for 
iraqs withdrawal from kuwait 
it never hurts to build in a little uncertainty about what our 
intentions are as it relates to jan 15 said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
he said the warning by lt gen calvin ah waller doesnt 
cause us any grief 
on another matter fitzwater said the white house would welcome 
approval by congress of a resolution along the lines of the un 
measure authorizing the use of force against iraq 
on the other hand he said bush always tells lawmakers if 
youre going to debate this for months and not reach a conclusion 
and argue about it then that may not be that helpful or if youre 
going to water it down 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who returned 
thursday with a sevenmember democratic delegation from seven days 
in the middle east said the group had sought to quash any notion 
that debate in congress means us divisions over bushs announced 
policy 
we made it clear that whatever the debate about timing and 
strategy and tactics in the gulf the united states is united 
behind the policy that assures that saddam hussein and iraqi forces 
must leave kuwait mitchell said 
sen paul simon dill said the trip had led to changes of 
views for some of the senators and said the group now agreed that 
military force must be used to dislodge iraq from kuwait if all 
else fails 
the administration also moved to blunt criticism in congress 
about the contributions of us allies in the persian gulf 
officials said allies have spent more than 9 billion for the 
americanled military showdown with iraq and the support is 
there 
some lawmakers have accused germany and japan wealthy nations 
dependent on oil imports of letting the united states shoulder 
the financial and military burden of the persian gulf crisis 
sen jim sasser dtenn said saudi arabia was reaping a 
windfall profit of about 150 million a day in increased oil sales 
and have contributed only 987 million in cash and material 
equivalent to about 65 days worth of those profits 
sasser chairman of the senate budget committee said japan had 
pledged 4 billion to the gulf effort and had paid 374 million 
through nov 30 germany he said had offered 900 million and 
paid 330 million 
the white house said it was not disturbed by the pace of the 
contributions 
were confident that the money will be there presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the support is there the 
leaders have all made their commitment to us and we dont think 
there is any special problem there 
fitzwater on wednesday also distanced the white house from 
predictions that any war with iraq would be over quickly 
sens ted stevens ralaska and daniel inouye dhawaii said 
us military commanders in the middle east indicated a war could 
be wrapped up within five days they said they got that impression 
during classified and other briefings during their tour of saudi 
arabia bahrain egypt and israel 
asked about their predictions fitzwater said we would be 
most reluctant to try and put numbers of days on it

the pentagon warned saddam hussein 
today that us air power will be ready to attack iraq by jan 15 
even if all ground forces are not ready for war by that 
unimposed deadline for him to withdraw from kuwait 
the statement came from a top aide to defense secretary dick 
cheney the morning after a senior us commander here raised 
eyebrows by saying american ground troops might not be ready to 
fight iraq until a month or more past the united nations deadline 
and that he would urge president bush not to order any attack until 
the full us deployment was ready for war 
cheney spokesman pete williams said cheney was not 
displeased by lt gen calvin ah wallers candid assessment 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
wallers comment doesnt cause us any grief 
it never hurts to build in a little uncertainty about what our 
intentions are as it relates to jan 15 fitzwater said 
still todays statement by williams and other comments by 
senior military officers here appeared clearly designed to give the 
deadline more teeth to counter any interpretation of wallers 
remarks as possibly undermining bushs demand that saddam meet the 
deadline or risk attack 
williams said cheney would not reach a conclusion on the 
readiness of us troops until the end of his fiveday trip here 
and would not as waller did share with reporters his advice to 
bush 
but williams said not having all ground forces fully ready for 
combat did not mean the americanled forces deployed against iraq 
could not initiate hostilities to free kuwait 
the air part of the force for example reaches its level of 
readiness earlier than the others williams said 
and the threestar officer in charge of army forces here lt 
gen john yeosock took a far more aggressive posture than waller 
saying im ready today for whatever mission ill be called upon 
to perform my perspective is saddam get out of kuwait or be 
prepared to face the consequences 
if war erupts yeosock said we will do everything in our 
power to apply maximum power in minimum time to maintain the 
highest uptempo battle ever recorded 
speaking privately a senior pentagon official agreed that 
waller went well beyond cheney and other senior military officials 
in discussing the us deployment but this official said saddam 
should not interpret wallers remarks as an extension of the jan 
15 deadline from a military standpoint 
this aint no break for saddam hussein the official said 
cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff were in daylong meetings today with senior american and 
saudi commanders they met wednesday with saudi crown prince 
abdullah and over dinner with prince sultan cheneys saudi 
counterpart 
in his blunt remarks wednesday waller second in command of 
operation desert shield said american troops might not be ready 
until well into february and that if asked by bush to launch an 
attack sooner his answer would be no im not ready to do the 
job 
fitzwater brushed aside wallers appraisal of the troops 
readiness 
what he really said is they might not be as ready as they 
would like to be for all the contingencies fitzwater said 
we are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are called 
upon to do 
secretary of state james a baker iii asked today about 
wallers comments said one of the important principles he learned 
in the marine corps was that it is critical to preserve the 
element of surprise 
other officers in saudi arabia said wallers remarks might 
undermine diplomatic efforts that center on convincing saddam he 
must comply with the deadline or risk a usled attack 
cheney fired gen michael dugan as air force chief of staff in 
september after dugan talked openly of the likelihood of bombing 
certain iraqi military and economic targets if hostilities began 
we supposedly want saddam to take this deadline seriously 
dont we said one officer who demanded anonymity he and another 
officer expressed concern that wallers remarks could be 
interpreted by saddam to render meaningless the jan 15 deadline 
set by the united nations for iraqs complete withdrawal from 
kuwait 
but waller said what is so magic why does it have to be that 
on jan 15th we must be ready to go and initiate hostilities at 
midnight on the 16th 
i would say to the president and the secretary as well as to 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that until our full 
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate 
hostile activities he said 
waller said some crucial heavy ground forces likely will not 
arrive in saudi arabia by the deadline 
the threestar general said he believed bush was aware of the 
readiness timetable and would not order an attack until ground 
commanders said they were ready 
other senior military officials however said even if that was 
the case waller should not be discussing the readiness of us 
troops publicly particularly less than a month before the 
deadline 
bush said monday that un resolutions against iraq which 
include one authorizing force if iraqi troops arent out of kuwait 
by jan 15 should be enforced right on schedule baker has 
been pressing allies to be ready to use force if saddam ignores the 
deadline 
waller said several vital components still were missing 
including navy carriers due to leave home port just after 
christmas combat aircraft due to arrive by jan 15 and about 
117000 armor troops coming from fort riley kan and from 
germany 
even if those troops do arrive by the un deadline he said 
theres a distinct possibility that every unit will not be fully 
combatready until sometime after the first of february

nearly a halfcentury after the nazi holocaust 
jews fleeing the soviet union are looking to germany as a land of 
opportunity with many heading to the newly united country rather 
than the united states or israel 
they have been pouring into berlin in growing numbers this week 
in an effort to beat a decision expected friday that many fear will 
tighten rules on their entry into germany 
since monday about 125 jews have arrived each day compared 
with a total of 350 in the first half of the month according to 
berlin city officials 
the new arrivals cite antisemitism as the main reason for 
leaving the soviet union which for months has been riddled with 
rumors of possible pogroms against jews 
israeli media reported thursday that panic has spread among the 
soviet jews and they are trying to leave their homeland by all the 
means available the accounts gave no reason for the reported panic 
and did not say when it started 
i am afraid of the situation of the jews in the soviet 
union said one woman in berlin who identified herself only as 
ina people discuss jews on moscows streets and in buses 
asked to summarize the remarks she said when the situation 
is difficult they try to get the people they think are 
responsible and they say the jews are responsible 
ina stood in line with more than 30 other soviet jews thursday 
at a counseling center in a mammoth communistera building in 
former east berlin 
many of the newcomers clustered together nervously discussing 
the latest snatches of information gleaned from their german 
surroundings and the language almost none of them understood 
everyone has been very friendly starting with the doorman 
ina said in english which she said she learned at a moscow foreign 
language institute 
because it is the first major german city on rail lines from the 
east berlin is the first stop off for most of the arriving soviet 
jews once there they face a round of questions to make sure they 
are jews 
on thursday families sat together on wellworn benches waiting 
to be called into the cramped counseling rooms there they would 
be given an orientation before being sent to refugee housing 
centers 
one refugee center is a building that once belonged to the 
dreaded east german secret police 
between 2000 and 4000 soviet jews have already reached germany 
this year according to michel friedman a spokesman for 
frankfurts jewish community he says many arrived in east germany 
without a visa before unification oct 3 making it difficult to 
establish a precise figure 
along with hundreds of thousands of refugees from dozens of 
other countries the soviet jews are straining germanys social 
services the jews are given shelter in berlin before being sent to 
other parts of the country 
fridays meeting in munich of the governors of germanys 16 
states is aimed at adopting new regulations to provide for the 
orderly entry of soviet jews but many of the current refugees 
reaching berlin say they are worried that the new rules will keep 
them out 
as a result german jewish leaders have appealed to government 
leaders for a generous quota for soviet jews saying germany 
has a moral responsibility to take them in because of the nazi 
holocaust in which more than 6 million jews perished 
as hundreds of thousands of other people whom i have nothing 
against are accepted in germany there is also the political and 
moral duty to help these jewish people in their acute 
distresssaid heinz galinski a survivor of the auschwitz death 
camp and president of germanys central council of jews 
the newly arriving soviet jews cite rising antisemitism as 
their many reason for leaving the soviet union 
i had problems at my job said 25yearold jan stelmakh from 
the soviet asian city of ashkhabad in the turkmenistan republic 
they wanted to fire me because i am jewish 
stelmakh who worked as an archeologist in a government history 
institute left behind his wife and 2monthold daughter when he 
fled he said he hopes they will be able to join him in germany 
another refugee summed up her concerns about jews in the soviet 
union in three words of halting german alles nicht gut all not 
good she said then broke into tears 
even in their new refuge the newcomers face occasional 
antisemitic threats in brandenburg outside berlin last month 
three men stormed into a temporary shelter shouting jews out 
jews out

legitimate political rights of the palestinians people 
in this context they agree that an international conference at

however the members of the council are of the view that there 
is not unanimity as to when would be the appropriate time for such 
a conference 
in the view of the members of the council the arabisraeli 
conflict is important and unique and must be addressed 
independently on its own merits

miami a a federal judge said today he has notified the us 
attorneys office to represent him in criminal contempt proceedings 
against cnn for broadcasting manuel noriegas taped prison phone 
calls 
legal scholars have said a contempt hearing could provide a 
judicial test of whether the government can practice prior 
restraint on the news media 
us district judge william hoeveler eventually allowed cable 
news network to broadcast the audio tapes after ruling they did not 
violate noriegas right to a fair trial 
but he announced in a court hearing last week that he intended 
to press contempt charges against the network if it were found to 
have defied his initial order banning use of the tape 
on wednesday he notified us attorney dexter lehtinen to draw 
up an order asking cnn to show cause why it should not be held in 
contempt 
the network will be allowed to respond in writing lehtinens 
spokeswoman diane cossin said today a hearing will be set if 
necessary 
because the order is against cnn and turner broadcasting system 
inc as corporations any penalties would take the form of fines 
not jail terms ms cossin added 
hoeveler said he decided to go forward with the criminal action 
because the network defied his restraining order without waiting 
first for the outcome of the legal process 
in atlanta network spokesman steve haworth said cnn is 
confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue of 
contempt its actions will be vindicated 
the tape at issue involved a conversation between noriega and an 
investigator with a defense attorneys secretary translating the 
network broadcast the tape for a day despite hoevelers order but 
withdrew it when the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
backed the lower court judge the us supreme court refused to 
involve itself in the matter

a leading civil rights group on thursday 
praised the 1990 congress but said president bush had continued the 
awful record of ronald reagan 
unfortunately on issues of race and sex discrimination the 
president has so far given virtually a blank check to the right 
wing said ralph g neas executive director of the leadership 
conference on civil rights 
the group in a report card on lawmakers in 1990 praised 
congress for bills designed to guarantee rights of the disabled and 
boosting minority hiring by reversing five supreme court decisions 
it also said congress deserves credit for measures designed to 
combat crimes involving bigotry expand child care raise the 
minimum wage reauthorize the us commission on civil rights and 
provide payments to japanese americans placed in camps after pearl 
harbor 
the conference is a coalition of 180 groups representing 
minorities women labor the disabled and others it often 
spearheads civil rights lobbying in washington its chairman is 
benjamin l hooks head of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
while the bush administration has regrettably continued the 
reagan administrations awful record on issues of race and sex 
discrimination the 101st congress continued the remarkable 
bipartisan congressional record on civil rights that has 
characterized the past decade neas said 
he said the major disappointment in congress from a civil rights 
perspective was the senates failure to override by one vote the 
presidents veto of the civil rights act of 1990 
by joining andrew johnson and ronald reagan as the only 
presidents in our history to veto a civil rights measure president 
bush has forever stigmatized his presidency neas said 
bush vetoed the measure saying it would lead employers to adopt 
racial hiring quotas civil rights forces scoff at that notion 
saying it would merely restore the law against job discrimination 
to its status before a complex 1989 supreme court decision 
both sides agree that the bill would make it easier for those 
claiming to be discrimination victims to win in court against 
employers

western women and children are 
leaving saudi arabias eastern province quickly as the un 
deadline approaches for iraq to retreat from kuwait 
the un security council has approved the use of force if iraq 
does not pullout of the neighboring emirate by jan 15 that would 
put eastern province residents near or on the battlefield between 
iraqi troops and a usled multinational force 
western residents surveyed at random said 90 percent of the 
1000 british women and children in the province bordering iraq and 
kuwait plan to leave as soon as possible and those departing on 
scheduled vacations would not return 
ireland and sweden on thursday joined the growing list of 
nations warning their citizens to leave the region hundreds of 
thousands of foreign workers are among the 2 million people in the 
region 
in view of the danger of hostilities irish people are 
strongly advised to send home dependents especially children 
said a statement from the foreign office in dublin 
on monday the british foreign office advised all dependents to 
leave the area by jan 15 echoing similar warnings issued by 
france and other eropean states 
the united states has not changed its advice since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait that leaving was strictly a personal decision 
but diplomats said they expect the state departments advisory to 
be upgraded within two weeks 
diplomats said there is no immediate danger but that in the 
event of war civilian air traffic would stop immediately and roads 
would probably quickly be flooded with refugees 
it now can take up to three days to get through to a travel 
agent on the phone waiting lists in early january are clogged and 
many expatriates are shipping family photographs and other 
valuables home 
tt is difficult to tell how many of the people leaving the 
region now were prompted to do so by the european governments 
travel advisories because the christmas season is a heavy time of 
travel the tempo of daily life has not changed 
many women said they wanted to be near their husbands who work 
in the eastern province but will take the precaution of moving 600 
miles east to the port of jiddah around jan 15 
the us civilian community of 12000 has shrunk to at least 
8000 since the invasion embassy officials said of those about 
half are women and children 
some companies reacted immediately to the british governments 
advisory that britons leave british aerospace which services the 
saudi air forces tornado jet fighters ordered 370 wives and 
children to be out of the country by jan 10 or risk loosing family 
benefits 
if there is a conflict in the north it will be impossible for 
anyone to get away from dhahran for several days because all 
international flights will stop said don maclean director of 
british aerospace in saudi arabia we dont think there is 
significant danger but there is a risk 
such measures displease the government of the eastern province 
which stresses that the main urban center around dhahran is far 
removed from any direct threat from saddam husseins army 
we feel that there will be no danger and this announcement 
will cause panic among other nationalities and even saudis said 
hassan ali aljasser director of public relations for the eastern 
province 
the largest area employer governmentowned aramco is not 
advising anybody to leave 
but preparations for a possible war are being made in the 
region the dhahran international hotel which serves as 
headquarters for scores of correspondents had its first air raid 
practice on thursday 
saudi arabia is scheduled to start testing its urban air raid 
sirens on saturday 
americans working here said the us government is reluctant to 
advise people to leave because the saudi government depends on us 
engineers for the most technical aspects of oil production

californias civil rights commission may 
not award damages for emotional distress or other personal harm 
caused by job discrimination the state supreme court ruled today 
the 52 ruling eliminates the fair employment and housing 
commissions ability to order damages for bias victims who commonly 
suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation 
caused by employers mistreatment 
those victims of sexual or racial harassment could still go to 
court and sue for a full range of damages but suits are available 
only to those who can afford a lawyer 
the court said the commission was authorized only to order back 
pay and reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require 
employers to take steps to prevent future discrimination 
in a separate decision today the court said discrimination 
victims were not required to file claims with the state before 
suing in court 
the rulings come three years after the court prohibited the same 
commission from awarding punitive damages in flagrant cases of job 
discrimination 
in that time the legislature has passed bills establishing the 
commissions authority to award both kinds of damages but gov 
george deukmejian vetoed them 
todays ruling was based on an interpretation of current state 
law and left open the possibility that the legislature could pass a 
new law allowing the commission to award damages 
but the opinion by justice edward panelli hinted that unlimited 
damage awards by the commission even if authorized by state law 
might be found unconstitutional as a violation of the right to a 
jury trial 
a jury in a court case is in the best position to determine 
just compensation for emotional and mental distress panelli 
wrote 
the ruling overturned a 20000 damage award by the commission 
to rose brown a secretary for the peralta community college 
district in oakland she claimed she was fired in april 1981 for 
refusing sexual advances by an administrator at laney college

consumers kept a tight grip on their wallets 
in november spending just 01 percent more than they did in 
october while their income growth merely matched the 03 percent 
growth in inflation the government said thursday 
analysts said they see no immediate improvement 
the commerce department said spending totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 373 trillion up from 372 trillion in 
october the october total was unchanged from september and was the 
first month spending had not increased since last may 
at the same time incomes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 471 trillion up from 470 trillion the previous month 
when they rose 05 percent 
but the department attributed the income gain solely to an 
increase in farm subsidies excluding those payments it said 
personal income essentially stalled in november 
that explains why consumers are not spending very much 
michael k evans head of a washington forecasting firm said 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group in washington 
agreed saying too much emphasis is being placed on the huge 
plunge in consumer confidence for the decline in spending 
the real reason is much more serious and thats that the 
economy is so weak she said peoples purchasing power is 
being squeezed 
squeezed so much that consumers apparently are dipping into 
their savings americans savings rate savings as a percentage of 
disposable income was 40 percent up from a 37 percent rate in 
october but dow from the 46 percent rate for all of 1989 
americans disposable incomes incomes after taxes inched up 
03 percent after remaining flat the previous month 
the spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation 
when adjusted spending actually fell 02 percent after a 08 
percent decline in october the lowest since a 22 percent decrease 
in january 1987 
disposable incomes when adjusted for inflation did not budge 
from october when they declined 08 percent the steepest drop 
since a 11 percent decline in april 1989 
a key component of the income category wages and salaries 
fell 39 billion following a revised 153 billion decline the 
previous month the october drop was even worse than the 93 
billion first reported 
spending on durable goods usually expensive products expected 
to last at least three years fell 90 billion in november after 
a 128 billion drop in october nondurable purchases were up 65 
billion following a 22 billion gain a month earlier spending on 
services rose 54 billion nearly half of the 107 billion 
advance in october

text of a speech by president mikhail s gorbachev 
to parliament on thursday following the resignation of foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze text was translated by the associated 
press 
 
i would not like either to simplify the situation or 
overdramatize it its most important not to fall into panic and 
especially hysterics and not to slip into accusations that will 
make us all feel ashamed tomorrow the situation that has emerged 
is really very serious it really is the culmination a certain 
so to speak situation has emerged here that in fact we ought to 
try and understand 
first of all we found it possible necessary and expedient that 
comrades prime minister nikolai ryzhkov kgb chief vladimir 
kryuchkov and shevardnadze should speak and even decided to allow 
them double the usual time so as to enable them to outline their 
evaluations proposals and express their ideas so all this seemed 
to fit well into a normal process as we foresaw it 
and i will tell you for me the statement by eduard 
amvrosiyevich shevardnadze about his resignation was unexpected 
and that frankly speaking is what hurts me most 
the talks i had with him on the telephone and there have 
been two do not yet enable me to make a full evaluation of the 
reasons for the decision he took we have agreed that we need to 
get together sit down and talk and discuss everything and i would 
not dot the is and pass a verdict on many issues starting withunequivocal 
condemnation of shevardnadzes step i think all this 
should be thought over and i will try to say a couple of words and 
explain why or conversely to ask him despite everything all 
this needs to be thought over 
what he said here and in my two telephone talks tells me that 
eduard amvrosiyevich shevardnadze decided with the help of such a 
step a protest to come out against those who are trying to take 
advantage of the difficulties and question the course directed 
toward perestroika on the main directions of struggle to reach the 
goals of perestroika and the renewal of the society and since as 
he thinks this offensive has assumed the character of a planned 
offensive and uninterrupted assaults he must resort to the 
sharpest forms in order to break the attacks against the 
implementation of this course and stop those who wish to take 
advantage of the acute situation and push us off course those are 
the arguments he outlined both here and to me because after all 
it is not in his personal interests 
i share this position in the sense that we must defend 
perestroika i stated the thesis outright that it is the main task 
of our congress as i see it in the real situation in which it 
proceeds when we all the entire society have reached the limit 
we must either confirm our choice or alter the course in essence 
the issue is such differences in tactical decisions in the rates 
of perestroika those after all are processes of real life a 
matter of search agreement i said then that we must defend this 
course despite all costs miscalculations errors that have 
resulted in difficult consequences and for which we must bear 
responsibility i am not evading responsibility but i can see 
responsibility above all in bringing this course to its logical 
conclusion so that it brings positive results for the entire 
society 
personally i condemn comrade shevardnadze for acting so without 
consulting with the president even more i will tell you directly 
since that matters have reached this point my plans included 
recommending comrade shevardnadze for vice president this is what 
the situation is like that is dotting the is 
i did not decide this for nothing this man made his choice long 
ago that we can no longer live in the kind of society in which we 
used to live confronting it as long as 10 years ago in a situation 
you know he entered into the confrontation with certain forces we 
knew about it and those who were near know all this well he like 
me working in regions and here came to the conclusion that even 
possessing the powers that we had we were unable to really unfold 
the processes life demanded that we go through all the trials 
all the keen discussions they were not public then to come to 
the understanding that we must take every chance to begin changing 
everything in the society he belongs to such a people 
even after all that i have said i do not want us to decide now 
that shevardnadze is written off and that he so to speak 
becomes history no i think we ought to support the opinion of our 
respected deputy academician dmitri likhachev the writer 
sergei zalygin and other comrades who did not fly too far off 
with their fantasies i cannot call it differently frightening 
ourselves and the entire country and to limit ourselves to the 
conclusion a serious event has happened that deserves that the 
president the supreme soviet the government try and sort it out 
in a normal situation as they should and then report their 
proposals and conclusions to this i think we should limit 
ourselves

willy brandt the elder statesman of german 
politics on thursday opened the first session of the newly elected 
parliament by saying the united nation was responsible for the 
safety of the jewish state 
the former chancellor also said he hoped for a settlement of 
israels conflicts with its arab neighbors 
the 662member parliament elected dec 2 met in the gleaming 
flowerdecorated chamber of the reichstag building near what was 
once the berlin wall 
lawmakers from east and west formally began work while outside 
the imposing battlescarred edifice german flags flew proudly in 
snowy skies 
legislators elected rita suessmuth as speaker giving the 
politician the same job she held in the parliament of former west 
germany and in the interim body that followed the oct 3 
unification of the two german states 
one day after his 77th birthday brandt delivered the keynote 
speech an honor he received as the oldest lawmaker 
is there anyone in the chamber who was born before dec 18 
1913 he asked jokingly at the start of his speech apparently 
no one wants to admit it or can admit it 
that drew a laugh from chancellor helmut kohl 60 and other 
lawmakers present 
in addition to urging resolution of the 4monthold persian 
gulf crisis brandt touched on german relations with israel 
we cannot escape our joint responsibility for the security and 
wellbeing of the state of israel said the nobel peace prize 
winner to that i add the urgent hope for an agreement with the 
arab neighbors 
brandt did not elaborate 
germans are agreed on the special responsibilities they bear 
following the nazi holocaust that claimed the lives of 6 million 
jews but german leaders also are increasingly insistent on 
resolution of the arabisraeli conflicts 
the most prominent conflict includes resolution of the 
palestinian question which iraqi president saddam hussein has said 
he wants to link to any withdrawal from kuwait which he invaded 
aug 2 
among those in the audience thursday was president francesco 
cossiga of italy which now holds the rotating chairmanship of the 
12nation european community 
the german lawmakers present included members of the party of 
democratic socialism the renamed east german communist party that 
has become almost a pariah in the parliament 
in his speech brandt said war is threatening at europes 
door although he did not explain the reference the social 
democratic leader urged germans to live up to their countrys 
growing importance in world politics 
the reichstag is the historic seat of german legislatures and 
was the site of the moving german reunification ceremony on oct 3 
lawmakers however will return to the seat of government in 
bonn for subsequent meetings they eventually will decide whether 
to move permanently to berlin the capital of the newly reunited 
nation 
much of brandts speech was aimed at encouraging germans to work 
together to complete the daunting task of unification 
it will take years before the living standards are equal in 
eastern and western germany there have been estimates that up to 
20000 eastern germans are heading west each month in search of 
betterpaying work 
mrs suessmuth in her speech referred to the surprise 
resignation of soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in 
moscow he was a key figure in the swift pace of german unity 
we cannot be thankful enough that we were able to complete 
unity during the period in the past mrs suessmuth said 
that appeared a reference to nowoutdated german fears that if 
unification had not been railroaded through political troubles in 
the soviet union could have blocked the process

and something else of course each of us plays his role for 
those of my colleagues who joined it and so to speak made their 
choice from the first days even before 1985 now perhaps is the 
most difficult time but it is unforgivable to leave at such a 
moment this must be condemned and the demand expressed that 
struggle be continued whatever turns that the road upon which we 
stepped will stay we will walk along it this is the main thing 
and today we must before our people and the world community confirm 
what we did at the first congress when we confirmed our course in 
foreign policies of our state a course directed toward healthier 
international relations new approaches that are already bearing 
fruit for the entire modern civilization and have opened the way 
to a prolonged period of peace this without doubt we must do even 
today immediately as foreign correspondents are already asking 
questions and academician vitaly goldansky when he spoke so to 
speak about three options asked what could all this mean a 
change of course thats it 
and something else i would support the idea of the worker who 
spoke here he did not introduce himself and i forget his name 
lets not confuse things we can see the state of our society the 
political instability the war of laws the inefficiency of the 
executive power gaps within it etc and this calls for immediate 
urgent measures to introduce order strengthen discipline to 
introduce tolerance into our society without which we cannot 
proceed with our transformations and we have just reached the 
critical mark in those transformations 
and please remember that many dozens of states had to go through 
such stages when they found themselves in this state at this or 
that period of their history and they always called for a strong 
power if you have jelly you can eat too much of it and even gag on 
it i can feel that what we have now is jellylike power it is not 
acceptable it prevents us from doing our job especially when 
people have such stresses when the patience has reached the limit 
it must be done 
and that does not mean talking about any dictatorship but about 
strong power and do not lets confuse these things because it 
would mean substituting one notion for another because the 
president now does not have information and i get extensive 
information that someone somewhere is preparing a junta or some 
other similar dictatorship etc no i do not have such 
information but if we are irresponsible careless if we do not 
listen to impulses coming from the society and miss the opportunity 
to strengthen our power and make it more dynamic then of course 
time may come when the society will start searching for solutions 
along those routes we must be aware of it these are the lessons 
of history so all this is interconnected and in this connection i 
reject comrade shevardnadzes thesis because it smacks a little of 
panic 
so i have been very open with you and i hope that you will 
support proposals put forward by the two deputies patriarchs of 
our culture and we will take this decision without going too far 
in our suppositions and accusations and ascribing things to our 
society that do not exist especially i think we must reject 
these emotional characteristics

us officials said thursday theres no point 
in resuming global trade talks until west european countries show 
they are ready to compromise on cutting farm subsidies 
arthur dunkel the director general of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade got that message in talks here on prospects for 
reviving the 107nation negotiations that collapsed two weeks ago 
in brussels belgium the officials said 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told dunkel on wednesday 
that the united states does not favor another ministerial meeting 
until the european community changes its position on 
agriculture yeutters spokesman said 
the other main point made by yeutter was that time is of the 
essence in concluding the negotiations said spokesman albert 
maruggi 
carla hills the us trade representative told dunkel the 
united states is ready to resume negotiations when there is a 
framework for agriculture negotiations mrs hills deputy 
julius katz said thursday 
it was rejection by the european community japan south korea 
and other countries of a compromise negotiating framework on the 
farm issue that brought the brussels talks to an impasse two weeks 
ago 
dunkel told reporters during his meetings here he was consulting 
with gatt member countries on the situation not negotiating 
katz said during a television interview beamed to asia that a 
jan 15 meeting planned in geneva to assess results achieved so far 
in the talks and prospects for restarting them does not 
necessarily signal resumption 
the january meeting could last less than a day he said noting 
that the united states is in contact with all parties resulting so 
far in lots of motion but not very much direction and no 
indication of more readiness for compromise on farm reform by the 
europeans 
katz who was a negotiator at brussels also accused japan of 
failing to play a vigorous role in the talks and letting the west 
european community take the blame for the collapse 
i regret to say japan has i think hidden behind the european 
community and lagged in putting forward its own proposals and 
not negotiated vigorously katz said over worldnet a 
usgovernmentsponsored television show 
theyve been permitted to enjoy this position because all the 
attention focussed on the european community but should the 
negotiations be resumed japan will have to step up to its 
responsibilities and be an active participant in the 
negotiations he said

more than 1000 soviet specialists have 
opted to stay in iraq to avoid a bleak winter in their country 
compounded by severe food shortages eastern european diplomats 
said thursday 
the news they receive from moscow about the economic situation 
is so discouraging that they prefer to stay here rather than go 
home one of the diplomats said on condition of anonymity 
moscow dispatched a senior official to iraq this week to 
complete the evacuation of 2565 soviet citizens remaining in iraq 
the baghdad government had said they could leave if their country 
accepted responsibility for the termination of their contracts 
the soviet official vladimir mordinove has informed the iraqi 
government that moscow was ready to compensate for the breach in 
contract mainly in the oil power and irrigation fields

strumming a guitar a folk singer sang protest 
songs thursday at humboldt university students sprawled on 
blankets uncorked wine bottles crude banners hung from elegant 
arches classrooms were dark and empty 
occupied read the gigantic cloth banner fluttering in the 
cold wind from the roof of humboldt the finest university in what 
used to be east germany 
students shut it down thursday occupied its halls and closed 
its classrooms in leipzig thousands of students set up blockades 
around prestigious karl marx university and in halle another 
4000 students held a protest rally at martin luther university 
while the new nations united parliament met for the first time 
thursday and paid tribute to german unity eastern german students 
occupied halls of higher education and symbolized the new nations 
division 
eastern germanys new leaders have begun implementing sweeping 
plans to restructure schools to fit the framework in the west 
scores of university departments many entwined with socialist 
doctrine will be closed 
but the plans have met fierce resistance from students who have 
held protests at scores of schools in the past week many fear 
years of study will suddenly be rendered worthless 
some educators say the new conflict is only the latest product 
of the former nations quick transition 
this mirrors the situation in the entire land said humboldt 
sports science teacher helmut hiller gesturing to the crowds of 
students packed in humboldts cavernous main lobby a scene more 
reminiscent of berkeley in the 1960s than berlin in the 1990s 
how fast should it go what should go first how should we 
deal with the past he said you can apply the same questions 
to everything 
the newly created five eastern german states and the city 
government of berlin now have responsibility for the school systems 
that were once run by the centralized communist government 
in the past week they have announced plans to begin 
restructuring the college system focusing most but not 
exclusively on departments that often were grounded in socialist 
ideology 
philosophy sociology journalism economics and several other 
departments are the most likely candidates to be eliminated or 
sharply reduced 
the berlin senate is to decide on saturday how its planned 
restructuring at humboldt will proceed and which teachers will go 
the students and many faculty members say the universities 
should be given autonomy to operate as they choose said conni 
sonntag 25 a student council leader 
there are changes that have to be made but this univeristy 
has made many many changes in the year since the collapse of 
communism in former east germany she said 
we want autonomy the western government should not make these 
decisions 
stately old humboldt which has 15000 students and 6000 
employees was founded in 1809 in the heart of historic berlin it 
has produced 27 nobel laureates and is known worldwide 
in 1948 with the soviets and the western allies occupying 
opposite sides of the city after world war ii political tensions 
grew within the school 
the alternative free university was established as a 
counterpoint on the west side of the city humboldt became more a 
bastion of communist ideology but it also spawned many dissident 
intellectuals 
now free university has become the blueprint for what the 
westerndominated government in berlin wants humboldt to be even 
departments that are expected to survive may face cutbacks 
in leipzig thousands of students blocked entrances and took 
over the chancellors office 
they met with saxony education minister hans joachim meyer to 
discuss the department closings he said new departments would be 
formed to replace old ones 
students at both schools vowed to continue the sitins through 
the christmas break 
in frankfurt the union of education sciences promised to 
provide legal support for the students union chief dieter wunder 
called the planned changes necessary but said they were being 
undertaken in a cold and arrogant manner

drug treatment experts disputed president bushs statistics on 
declining drug use thursday saying they ignore the very 
populations affected most by addiction the homeless and the 
innercity poor 
if youre in prison if youre homeless if youre mentally 
ill and on the street you simply dont exist in these 
statistics said steve dnistrian a spokesman for new york citys 
phoenix house the nations largest residential drug treatment 
center 
i think the numbers are very misleading youll see declines 
out in say scarsdale or parts of orange county california but 
not in east harlem or watts 
nina peyser executive director of the chemical dependency 
institute at beth israel medical center said there has been no 
evidence of a decrease in new york city in recent memory 
absolutely not we have had waiting lists as long as ive been 
here and ive been here 15 years said peyser whose center 
treats 8100 heroin addicts in the city 
the study also fails to address drugrelated problems such as 
pregnant addicts aids and the dysfunctional families created by 
drug use all of which still plague the inner city the experts 
noted 
the household survey on drug abuse released wednesday reported 
that use of any illicit drug dropped 44 percent during the last 
five years the survey conducted by the national institute on drug 
abuse also found a 72 percent drop in casual cocaine use during 
the past five years 
the survey covered households with telephones meaning it 
ignored large parts of society where drug problems are rampant 
experts said 
these people missed the cocaine epidemic in the treatment 
field we dont pay much attention to nida studies said scott 
mcmillin director of the addiction treatment center at suburban 
hospital in bethesda md 
rene topalain assistant director of drug abuse services for the 
los angeles county department of health said it was too early to 
declare victory in the war on drugs 
we are still dealing with the issue of cocaine babies aids 
and the transmission of aids by people who are drug users and heavy 
alcohol use said topalain so i would not sit here and say 
anything like we have turned the corner on the drug problem 
elected officials and prosecutors joined the treatment centers 
in questioning the studys findings 
you look at the inner city and there is no 70 percent 
reduction you will see those statistics are invalid said 
special narcotics prosecutor sterling johnson in new york city 
evidence of the drug problem is in the city and state jail 
population said johnson in 1985 the state had 27000 inmates 
this year its 58000 inmates awaiting trial on rikers island 
numbered 10000 in 1985 this year its 21000 he said 
i do nothing but prosecute narcotics felonies in 1985 i had 
maybe 2000 indictments in 1990 there were 7000 indictments the 
drugs are out there said johnson 
new york gov mario cuomo speaking thursday morning in new york 
city derided the bush administration statistics and urged mayor 
david dinkins to invite the president to new york for a firsthand 
look at the drug problem 
i think bush has been misled by advisers with respect to 
where we stand in the war against drugs we here in the city of new 
york know better said dinkins and id be delighted to show 
him the evidence

saudi arabias national airline declined a 
postal service request that it waive international mail rates in 
favor of the lower fees observed by us airlines for carrying mail 
to american troops in the saudi desert a postal official said 
thursday 
james e orlando head of international services for the postal 
service confirmed that saudi arabian airlines had charged the 
service nearly 19 million to deliver about 105 million pounds of 
mail addressed to desert shield troops during the sept 1oct 17 
period 
rep benjamin gilman rny had cited those figures in a 
letter of protest to the saudi ambassador and the postmaster 
general saying that was too much to pay 
orlando questioned by a reporter said the amount was 
reasonable in that it complied with the rates set by the universal 
postal union an international organization of postal 
administrators 
but he noted the saudis had declined a pstal service request 
that the airline instead observe the mailrate schedule set by the 
department of transportation for usflagged carriers the upu 
rates are about 2 12 times higher than the us rates 
gilman ranking republican on the house post office and civil 
service committee said in his letter bearing in mind that the 
congress had provided free mailing privileges to our military 
personnel in saudi arabia permit me to express my strong 
disapproval and to recommend that the us postal service work 
with the department of defense and the state department to ensure 
that saudi airlines absorb these mail expenses 
orlando said that the whole issue that congressman gilman had 
which is whether we should be paying that rate level to the saudi 
government in view of the fact that were over there defending 
them as far as im concerned is a legitimate issue for the 
congress and the administration but not for the postal service 
we approached saudi airlines and asked if they would be 
willing to accept the dot rate level orlando said they 
declined and insisted on the upu rate level which is what we did 
pay them 
the postal service decided to use the saudi airline at that time 
because it had more mail than it could send on usflagged 
carriers which must accept the dot rate orlando noted 
since midnovember virtually all mail to desert shield troops 
has been carried by military aircraft orlando said 
under the law providing free mailing privileges to desert 
shield soldiers the defense department must reimburse the postal 
service

american businesses worried about a 
recession plan a barely perceptible 04 percent increase in 
spending to modernize in 1991 the most pessimistic outlook for 
business investment in five years 
the findings released in a commerce department report thursday 
showed that the pessimism about the future that had been widely 
reflected in surveys of consumer sentiment has spread to american 
businesses 
the plans for 1991 reflect increasingly tough times in the 
economy said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the 04 percent increase after adjusting for inflation would 
follow a projected advance of 41 percent for this year 
it would be the weakest showing since business investment fell 
31 percent in 1986 when american manufacturers battered by a 
flood of foreign goods cut back plans to expand and modernize 
some economists said even the tiny 04 percent gain was unlikely 
if the recession turns out to be worse than expected the estimate 
they said is based on a survey taken in october and early 
november 
since then evidence has mounted that the downturn could be 
worse than originally believed a report last week showed 
industrial output fell in november at the steepest pace since the 
end of the last recession in 198182 
sinai predicted that when the actual 1991 spending is totaled 
it will show business investment falling anywhere from 3 percent to 
5 percent that would act as a further drag on the economy because 
business investment in each of the past two years has contributed 
about onefifth of the economys total growth 
evelina tainer an economist with first national bank of 
chicago said the weak spending plans reflected producers 
pessimism about the economy 
the survey put total 1991 business investment spending at 5242 
billion earlier surveys for 1990 had put the spending advance as 
high as 55 percent 
the latest estimate of a 41 percent increase was down a full 
percentage point from a 51 percent projection based on a survey 
released three months ago 
in another report reflecting the sluggish economy the commerce 
department said consumer spending remained sluggish in november 
inching up just 01 percent after holding steady the previous 
month 
consumer spending represents about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity 
at the same time the department said personal incomes rose a 
scant 03 percent just keeping pace with inflation however the 
rise was attributed entirely to increases in farm subsidies 
excluding those incomes would not have changed 
analysts blamed weak spending on the weak growth in personal 
income 
the combination of job losses reductions in hours worked and 
a recession in manufacturing and other sectors is just not 
generating income in wages and salaries sinai said it sets a 
very bleak picture in place for consumer spending 
many economists are looking for total economic activity as 
measured by the gross national product to fall by between 3 
percent and 4 percent at an annual rate in the current 
octoberdecember quarter they believe that downturn will mark the 
start of the countrys ninth recession since world war ii 
the governments first look at gnp in the fourth quarter will be 
released next month 
however some economists saw a glimmer of optimism in the fact 
that the business spending survey showed any increase at all in 
investment for next year 
the fact that capital spending will slow but not actually 
decrease is commensurate with the view the recession will be milder 
than the postwar average said economist gordon richards of the 
national association of manufacturers 
michael k evans head of a washington forecasting company 
agreed saying that any spending increase means the recession is 
going to be very mild and last only two quarters 
all of the figures have been adjusted for inflation 
before adjusting for inflation the survey projected a 24 
percent increase for all businesses in 1991 to 5467 billion 
after gains of 114 percent in 1989 and 11 percent in 1988 
it said the investment increase for all industries includes a 
46 percent gain for manufacturing companies and a 56 percent 
advance for companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing businesses 
manufacturers are projecting investment spending of 1936 
billion the gain includes a 14 percent increase by industries 
making durable goods bigticket items expected to last at least 
three years and a 73 percent increase by those engaged in 
nondurables such as food and clothing

the next soviet foreign minister will face a 
different world than eduard a shevardnadze took on five years ago 
but the possible candidates all appear to be dedicated followers of 
the policy he set down 
although gorbachev could reach outside the foreign ministry for 
a replacement speculation focuses on the foreign policy 
establishment they have the kind of training shevardnadze lacked 
when mikhail s gorbachev appointed him in the summer of 1985 to 
take over for andrei a gromyko 
unlike shevardnadzes crusade for change in the last five years 
the next foreign minister will need to maintain and cultivate the 
soviet unions new role as friend of the united states a mediator 
in international disputes and partner in cooperation with europe 
and the former members of the oviet bloc 
the new foreign minister still will face old guard bureaucrats 
in some departments at the foreign ministry as he navigates new 
relations with israel the vatican japan south korea and germany 
among others 
there will likely be less financial and military aid to use as 
tool of soviet policy because the government must deal with a 
crippled economy and a budget deficit 
here is a brief look at those considered prime candidates for 
the job 
yevgeny m primakov the first candidate mentioned in the soviet 
press after shevardnadzes resignation is a 61yearold former 
professor known most recently for his shuttle diplomacy to iraq and 
the search for a solution to the persian gulf crisis 
his effort failed after several meetings with iraqi president 
saddam hussein reported to be a longtime friend but still it 
heightened his status as a savvy envoy who knows his war around the 
volatile middle east 
before becoming a deputy foreign minister last year primakov 
was director of the institute for world economy and international 
relations an expert on the middle and far east and with a 
doctorate in economics primakov helped devise the new thinking 
foreign policy that shevardnadze was implementing 
valentin m falin 64 became chief of the communist partys 
international department in 1988 before the partys credibility 
plummeted and the job lost some of its influence over foreign 
policies 
falin is considered a master diplomat and the leading soviet 
expert on western europe he rose through the foreign ministrys 
european departments and served as a soviet attache in austria and 
ambassador to west germany 
he was an adviser to gromyko in 1965 a national legislator on 
the foreign affairs committee a member of the government daily 
izvestias editorial board and member of the partys policymaking 
central committee 
vladimir f petrovsky a deputy foreign minister since 1986 has 
seen his stock rise lately because of his middle eastern knowledge 
the 57yearold diplomat was in baghdad while the soviet union 
began dropping its cautionary tone and threatening to support force 
against iraq if saddam didnt pull out of kuwait 
he began his foreign service career as an english translator at 
the united nations he became chief of the foreign ministrys us 
department then head of the ministrys section that deals with 
international organizations 
yuli a vorontsov 61 a rare generalist in soviet diplomacy 
worked in the united states india and france before being sent as 
troubleshooting ambassador to afghanistan during the soviet 
pullout in 1988 
his experience includes meeting secretly in 1985 with israels 
ambassador in france to discuss restoration of ties defending 
soviet human rights policies at a rights conference in 1977 and 
leading disarmament talks in 1985 on us and soviet intermediate 
and strategic nuclear weapons 
he later was brought back to moscow and made first deputy 
foreign minister solidifying his place in a new generation of 
flexible innovative diplomats 
alexander a bessmertnykh 57 an expert on ussoviet 
relations was made soviet ambassador to the united states in april 
and a time of several foreign service changes 
he had served in the soviet embassy in washington for 13 years 
before returning to moscow in 1983 where he was a deputy foreign 
minister responsible for the united nations and north america he 
later rose to become one of three first deputy foreign ministers

president elias hrawi on thursday chose 
education minister omar karami to form a new government aiming to 
end 15 years of civil war in lebanon 
but three militia groups have expressed doubts that karami could 
carry out the task 
the presidential statement said the choice was based on the 
outcome of daylong consultations by hrawi with parliament blocs on 
a successor to prime minister salim hoss 
hoss a sunni moslem resigned with his 13monthold cabinet on 
wednesday to make way for a broadbased national reconciliation 
government karami 55 is also a sunni 
karami told reporters at hrawis residence he accepted the 
designation and would promptly begin consultations to form the new 
cabinet 
we shall form the government and the wheel of peace and unity 
will roll and i hope all will get aboard he said 
traditionally the president has been a maronite catholic the 
prime minister a sunni and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem 
hrawi met with parliament speaker hussein husseini after polling 
61 deputies of parliaments 68 surviving members on a successor to 
hoss 
the statement said hrawi then issued a presidential decree 
accepting the resignation of hoss and his 14member cabinet and 
signed another decree naming karami prime minister 
lebanese media said hrawi wants the new government formed of a 
crosssection of 30 politicians and warlords to end the civil war 
which had claimed more than 150000 lives 
but serious doubts have been voiced about the ability of karami 
a lawyer to put together such a government coalition 
karami surfaced on the political stage only three years ago 
when he inherited the leadership of the northern provincial capital 
of tripoli from his elder brother the late prime minister rashid 
karami 
the elder karami the longest serving prime minister in 
lebanons 47 years of independence was assassinated by a bomb 
explosion aboard an army helicopter in northern lebanon on june 1 
1987 
karamis mission was jolted when the fundamentalist hezbollah 
or party of god irans main ally in lebanon said it refuses to 
join his government 
the new government is certain to lack the vision and the 
minimum degree of harmony required to resolve the nations woes 
said a statement by hezbollah which fields one of lebanons three 
strongest militias 
the two other main militias the lebanese forces of christian 
chieftain samir geagea and druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party earlier expressed reservations about 
the government change 
jumblatts party predicted karamis would be an untidy 
government that would stumble upon its first steps this could 
create a dangerous power vacuum 
the lebanese forces a traditional civil war foe of jumblatt 
voiced a similar concern saying karami lacked the statesmanship 
and national prestige of his predecessor 
the statement said geagea will not take part in the new 
cabinet because it looks like it is going to be a tower of 
babel 
the new government faces the task of disbanding the warring 
militias and enforcing an arab leaguebrokered peace plan that 
parliament ratified aug 22 
it must also fill 31 vacancies in the onechamber parliament by 
appointment and raise the number of seats from 99 to 108 to attain 
equality between moslems and christians as envisaged by the peace 
plan 
christians have had a 6to5 edge in parliament since 
independence from france in 1943 
the present parliament was elected in 1972 for a fouryear term 
the civil war which broke out in 1975 has prevented elections and 
the house has repeatedly renewed its mandate 
government troops reunited wardivided beirut dec 3 by 
deploying in the capital and its environs after militias withdrew 
from beirut to their areas of influence in north east and south 
lebanon

former british prime minister edward heath 
told congress thursday to hold off declaring war on iraq because 
the costs of such a conflict would be high and saddam hussein knows 
it 
my own view is that it is essential that now we put the 
emphasis on the diplomatic action heath said before a hearing of 
the house armed services committee 
heath who visited saddam on a humanitarian mission in october 
said war might be necessary if in the end no other solution is 
found for the time being he said the united states and its allies 
should give un sanctions against iraq more time to work 
the world community that opposed saddams aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait should be trying to encourage a settlement of iraqs 
grievances against kuwait while trying to prod iraq to withdraw its 
troops from the country he said 
it has become more and more obvious that the costs of any war 
now in the gulf are going to be extremely high for both sides 
the former conservative party leader said i am convinced that 
president saddam hussein and those around him now recognize this 
but heath said i wouldnt underestimate saddam husseins 
capability of waging war iraqs millionman army developed its 
desert warfare skills in the eightyear conflict with iran that 
ended july 1988 
heath played down the significance of jan 15 as a deadline for 
iraqi troops to get out of kuwait the un resolution stipulates 
such a date but heath said it could be easily ignored 
heath also said saddam miscalculated the world reaction to his 
annexation of kuwait but he is certainly not mad and he is 
certainly not a hitler 
hes astute and its noticeable in his policy that he does 
things which are unexpected he said he is a very determined 
person 
if sanctions take their toll on iraq as they eventually will 
heath said saddam might show some flexibility in withdrawing his 
troops from part of kuwait 
ultimately saddam does not want to be isolated from his arab 
neighbors heath said adding the conflict must be solved by arabs 
in an arab settlement kuwait could agree to write off the debt 
iraq owes it stemming from the iraniraq war and a buffer region 
could be set up between the two countries he said 
but heath said saddam deeply distrusts the united states and 
britain and needs some assurances they will not attack him 
he added that there were backchannel negotiations underway 
between various nations but refused to provide any details

plea bargain by a senior israeli air force officer accused of 
accepting millions of dollars in bribes while purchasing usmade 
military equipment 
according to the deal brig gen rami dotan will be required to 
return 10 million in bribes and kickbacks he allegedly accepted 
while heading the defense ministrys department of military

dotan also agreed to supply investigators with the names of 
other people involved in the scam israel radio said

concerns it might jeopardize the 18 billion in us military aid 
israel receives annually 
in announcing the plea bargain which was signed last week 
chief military prosecutor brig gen amnon strashnov dismissed 
criticism that the deal could limit full disclosure of the 
corruption 
there is no attempt to hide or to cover up anything here he 
said if we could have reached the truth without this 
agreement i would have been the last one to sign it 
strashnov said that besides allegedly accepting bribes dotan is 
accused of fraud breech of trust receiving money illegally and 
conspiracy to commit a crime 
israel television said dotan is also suspected of swindling the 
air force out of money and equipment 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said wednesday that the 
accusations if proven amounted to treason but strashnov said the 
charge sheet against dotan would contain no such charge 
the plea bargain must be accepted by the military court trying 
dotan 
dotan was arrested in october and resigned as air force chief of 
logistics he is one of the highestranking officers ever brought 
to trial for a weapons scandal

a publisher has refused to halt distribution 
of a directory of charitable organizations that the council of 
better business bureaus says contains stale and unreliable 
information about the councils evaluations of charities

states it lists about 700 charities with information including 
whether they claim to meet the councils standards for charitable 
solicitations

united states boosting purchases this week to more than 13 
million metric tons the agriculture department said thursday

states northwest pocket are raising fears and gun sales at the 
same time 
the man being sought is between 20 and 35 years old portage 
police sgt warren e lewis said wednesday evidence has now 
linked the seven shootings he said he declined to say what that 
evidence is

police tuesday at the scene of the slayings of two brothers in 
their tailor shop in gary 
the brothers ilija eli balovski and george baloski were 
killed by shotgun blasts to the head lake county coroner daniel 
thomas said

presidentelect lech walesa on thursday 
delayed naming a government and said he may put off parliamentary 
elections for a year to give the leadership he eventually selects 
time to attack polands problems 
however he said he may instead keep the spring vote on schedule 
and allow a modified version of the current government led by 
tadeusz mazowiecki to serve in the interim 
walesa who saturday will be inaugurated as polands first 
popularly elected president will make a final decision after the 
christmas and new year holidays said a statement issued by his 
spokesman andrzej drzycimski he had been expected to name a new 
government quickly after his swearingin 
the presidentelect has concluded that an entirely revamped 
government now would mean delaying polands first fully free 
parliamentary elections since world war ii because the new team 
would need one year to work the statement said 
walesa might instead keep mazowieckis government with 
essential corrections for a threemonth transition the statement 
said mazowiecki himself could be asked to stay if there is 
social approval for it drzycimski later told the pap news 
agency 
parliament on dec 14 accepted mazowieckis resignation as prime 
minister walesas former adviser in the solidarity labor movement 
mazowiecki quit as head of government after losing the bitter 
campaign for president he said he wanted to head a new political 
group the democratic union that would oppose walesa 
it was unclear if he now would consider remaining as interim 
prime minister a spokesman for him boguslaw piwowar said 
thursday night there would be no immediate reaction 
mazowieckis deputy premier finance minister leszek 
balcerowicz the architect of polands shock economic reform 
program also is being mentioned prominently as a contender to lead 
the new government 
lech walesa fully respects the will of the voters awaiting 
quick formation of the government however he wants to act with 
reason said his statement 
the statement said walesa was faced with two options 
first he could nominate a new prime minister and cabinet that 
would live up to social expectations but that would mean 
postponing the spring parliament elections for one year 
second he could leave the old government with essential 
corrections which would survive up to spring elections 
under polands still evolving democracy the president nominates 
the prime minister who is responsible for daytoday running of the 
government the president is the chief of state and 
commanderinchief of the military and may dismiss parliament in 
certain welldefined circumstances 
jan olszewski an attorney designated by walesa to hold talks on 
forming a government gave up the mission tuesday in what a source 
close to him said was a disagreement with walesa over how large a 
role balcerowicz would have 
balcerowicz refused to answer any questions about his prospects 
during a meeting at the sejm the lower house of parliament 
sources in the solidarity labor movement where walesa first rose 
to prominence said that as of wednesday balcerowicz appeared 
virtually certain of getting the post 
the walesa spokesman drzycimski confirmed balcerowicz was 
under consideration for the premiership and in any case was sure to 
have a key role in the next government 
deputy mieczyslaw gil chairman of the solidarity parliamentary 
caucus said just before a meeting with balcerowicz that he would 
make a very good prime minister 
two other candidates once mentioned as possible premiers by 
walesa ruled themselves out jaroslaw kaczynski of the center 
alliance party and jan krzysztof bielecki of the liberal party of 
gdansk 
the newspaper gazeta wyborcza reported thursday that balcerowicz 
had accepted in talks with walesa certain adjustments in the 
yearold economic reform plan they were not detailed 
a 43yearold economist balcerowicz assumed head of the finance 
ministry and the deputy premiership in september 1989 in the east 
blocs first noncommunist government 
the shock plan which bears balcerowiczs name took effect 
jan 1 it combined sharp rises in prices with an end of state 
subsidies on most goods wage controls and a stable devalued 
zloty made largely convertible with western currencies 
it also calls for a breakup of big state monopolies and 
privatizing about 7000 stateowned enterprises a process just 
getting under way 
soon after the programs introduction lines and empty shop 
shelves that had characterized the polish economy for years 
disappeared private commerce blossomed but production in the 
state sector fell sharply unemployment previously unknown rose 
to 11 million during the year

his trademark was a dark vested suit but 
eduard shevardnzadze quickly got down to his shirt sleeves with 
james baker 
his candid description of the failure of communism on a flight 
to wyoming in september 1989 convinced the secretary of state that 
shevardnadze was committed to reform and would not mislead the 
bush administration 
it marked a turning point toward a warm personal and 
geopolitical relationship 
with all the talk of nuclear arsenals and more lately the 
rumblings of war in the persian gulf shevardnadzes mood remained 
as expansive as his native soviet georgia 
when baker took him to jackson hole wyo he readily donned 
fishing boots and waded into the snake river genuinely enjoying 
the sparkling water and americas outdoors 
he commented months later that we do our best work outside our 
capitals and he reciprocated by taking baker to lake baikal in 
eastern siberia 
we have a lot of business to do with the secretary of state 
for 10 years maybe shevardnadze said only a few weeks ago 
baker invited the foreign minister to his hometown houston 
where they plotted last week a us aid package that will provide 
up to 1 billion in credits for the purchase of food and other 
agricultural commodities to help the soviets through the winter 
as they toured the johnson space center shevardnadze quipped 
that maybe their next meeting ought to be held in space 
and as he sat at the control of a mockup shuttle shevardnadze 
could not resist im flying im flying he called out with a 
broad grin and he declared houston the best city in america 
at that same twoday meeting baker advised shevardnadze that 
the heavyhanded approach the kremlin was taking to separationists 
in the baltics and to profiteers in moscow and other large cities 
could imperil us assistance 
it was like preaching to the choir 
a us official recalling shevardnadzes more than five years 
as foreign minister said he has come across consistently as a 
truly committed democrat he said perestroika economic 
reconstruction and democratization cannot be separated 
his resignation was attributed by this official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity to the domestic drift to the right 
baker and shervardnadze met 19 times this year alone from 
siberia and new york to paris moscow helsinki and namibia 
they were on a firstname basis and baker at a news conference 
thursday paid tribute to his superpower partner 
i have known eduard shevardnadze to be a man of his word a 
man of courage conviction and principle baker said im 
convinced that he is committed to peaceful reform political and 
economic in the soviet union

prosecutors worked on criminal contempt charges 
thursday against cnn for allegedly violating a judges order 
prohibiting the network from airing tapes of manuel noriegas 
prison telephone calls 
us district judge william hoeveler announced his intention 
last week to press contempt charges against the network because it 
apparently defied his initial order banning use of the audio tapes 
hoeveler eventually allowed cable news network to broadcast the 
tapes ruling they did not violate noriegas right to a fair trial 
on charges of providing safe passage for colombia drug traffickers 
through panama 
the contempt charges were expected to be ready in a few days 
said diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office 
because the order is against cnn and parent turner broadcasting 
system inc as corporations any penalties would take the form of 
fines not jail terms ms cossin said 
cnn is confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue 
of contempt its actions will be vindicated cnn spokesman steve 
haworth said

the pentagon adopted an aggressive 
stance a day after a senior officer questioned american combat 
readiness in the persian gulf warning saddam hussein that us air 
power could punish iraq even if ground forces were not ready for 
allout war by jan 15 
pentagon officials visiting the gulf and senior officers already 
there said thursday that saddam should not interpret the comments 
by the deputy commander of americas gulf forces as a sign the 
united states would not attack until well past the un deadline 
for withdrawal from kuwait 
lt gen calvin ah waller began the controversy in comments 
wednesday to reporters accompanying defense secretary dick cheney 
and gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
on their weeklong gulf trip 
waller said ground forces yet to arrive in the region might not 
be combatready until well into february and recommended that 
president bush delay any military action until then 
bush talked over the gulf situation privately with members of 
congress on thursday saying according to several of them that he 
believes saddam is underestimating us power and intentions 
saddam must be made aware that if we get into an armed 
situation hes going to get his ass kicked rep elton 
gallegly rcalif quoted bush as saying bushs remark was 
confirmed by another person at the meeting 
as for waller bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said merely 
it never hurts to build in a little uncertainty about what our 
intentions are as it relates to jan 15 it doesnt cause us 
any grief to have a little uncertainty in the mind of saddam 
hussein about exactly when you might choose to enforce the un 
sanctions 
the commander of army forces in saudi arabia lt gen john 
yeosock was far more optimistic that waller in comments thursday 
clearly we are ready to perform whatever mission we are 
called upon to carry out yeosock said he promised a violent 
fast battle if war begins 
other officials did not dispute the essence of wallers 
nonreadiness assessment though there was private criticism that 
he had been too open and might have hurt the effort to persuade 
saddam that bush might order an attack on jan 15 or very soon 
thereafter 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said merely 
that an important principle he learned in the marine corps was that 
it is critical to preserve the element of surprise 
if nothing else wallers statements and those of other 
officials seemed to support the idea that an early attack would 
heavily feature air assaults designed to weaken iraqs war machine 
and give stillarriving us ground forces more time to prepare 
yeosock said that although iraq continues to pour troops into 
kuwait and southern iraq the reinforcements are less capable troops 
and the iraqi occupation force is near its maximumforce potential 
iraq also urged its citizens to stockpile oil in a new 
indication the iraqis were girding for war 
a pentagon spokesman in washington said an additional 10000 
us troops arrived in saudi arabia this week pushing the total 
american force to 280000 soldiers sailors airmen and marines 
the spokesman bob hall said us intelligence sources put the 
iraqi force in and around kuwait at 510000 
in saudi arabia as cheney and powell huddled in daylong 
private meetings with commanders spokesman pete williams said 
cheney was not displeased by wallers comments 
but williams issued a brief statement saying cheney would not 
reach conclusions of his own about the status of the deployment 
until the end of his fiveday trip and then unlike waller would 
share his advice only with the president 
and williams in a clear effort to attach a military threat to 
the un deadline said some of the us firepower would be at full 
strength by the deadline 
the air part of the force for example reaches its level of 
readiness earlier than the others williams said 
a senior pentagon official speaking privately said all combat 
aircraft committed to the gulf would be in place by jan 15 and 
saddam should be deeply worried about that deadline 
as for ground forces yeosock said we will do everything in 
our power to apply maximum power in minimum time to maintain the 
highest uptempo battle ever recorded 
yeosock said american forces had taken extensive steps to 
prepare for combat on a dirty battlefield in the event saddam 
uses chemical weapons 
he said iraqi forces are stacked behind each other in defensive 
lines and have dug extensive fortifications that include mine 
fields and barbed wire asked if us ground forces could crash 
through he said i wouldnt say its easy but we can do it 
in other gulf developments suggestive of war preparation on 
thursday 
ireland urged its citizens to leave the region by jan 15 and 
bangladesh asked its people to leave iraq and kuwait immediately 
turkey was requesting reinforcements from fellow nato members 
asking that a land and air force of 5000 men be in place on its 
border with iraq by jan 15 said a senior nato source in brussels 
belgium 
a spokesman for britains royal navy said two landing ships 
will join two others already in the gulf by jan 15 giving britain 
added capability for involvement in any amphibious assault on the 
coast of kuwait 
egypt sent more troops to saudi arabia part of the additional 
7000 soldiers that president hosni mubarak has pledged to 
reinforce the 20000man egyptian force in the kingdom

a federal communications commission decision 
that the owner of a small radio station in fredonia ny can 
neither renew his license nor sell the business was upheld on 
thursday by the us court of appeals 
the fcc decided in march 1989 not to renew catoctin broadcasting 
corps license for the 250watt station wbuzam on grounds that 
owner henry serafin had discriminated in his hiring practices lied 
to the commission and held a contest in which he kept the prize 
we defer to the commissions expertise and judgment a 
threejudge panel on the appeals court wrote 
this was the first time in a decade that the fcc had pulled a 
license on character grounds only about 100 stations have lost 
their licenses since the fcc was founded in 1934 
serafin who learned of the decision thursday from the 
associated press said he did not know what he would do next 
im in shock right now he said from the station about 30 
miles south of buffalo i have to take a day or two to think this 
thing out 
he said he was considering asking the appeals court for a 
rehearing another option would be an appeal to the us supreme 
court in the meantime serafin said he could continue to 
broadcast 
in 1981 catoctins application to renew its license was 
challenged by the chatauqua county rural ministry inc the 
dunkirk ny chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and the local branch of the league 
of women voters 
among the charges against serafin was that he had discriminated 
against a black job applicant in 1980 the three groups said 
serafin had called the womans employment agency and asked dont 
you have any white girls to send me adding that the woman 
would make charcoal look white 
in running a contest at the station in 1982 serafin also 
allegedly kept the grand prize a stereo system for himself and 
gave another prize a trip to niagara falls to a favored 
advertiser 
in addition serafin repeatedly refused to make catoctins 
public file available to citizens the file contains a stations 
filings with the fcc and citizen complaints 
in 1986 an administrative law judge denied the stations 
application for renewal saying that serafin was dishonest 
untrustworthy and unreliable 
serafin appealed the ruling and the case went to an fcc review 
board the board concurred with the decision which was affirmed by 
the full commission in 1989

advocates for people with aids called thursday 
for the federal government and drug manufacturers to move faster in 
getting two experimental antiaids drugs approved 
they said many thousands of aids patients need access to 
dideoxyinosine known as ddi and dideoxycytidine or ddc because 
azt the only approved antiviral aids therapy does not work or is 
no longer effective for them 
our patients know these newer drugs are probably not cures and 
that all the research is not done to determine their longterm 
complications said dr peter hawley medical director of the 
whitmanwalker clinic in washington 
but many would be understandably happy to have a chance at 
having a longterm complication he said 
the food and drug administration whose job it is to approve new 
drugs said neither of the companies making the drugs has applied 
for approval and the agency cannot move ahead until they do 
bristolmyers squibb co is providing ddi to about 1750 people 
in clinical trials and more than 14500 patients in an expanded 
access program said spokeswoman susan yarin this larger number 
includes patients for whom azt does not work or who do not live 
close enough to a trial to participate 
the company plans to submit a new drug application or nda in 
the first quarter of 1991 which extends from january through 
march she said 
we are having an ongoing discussion with fda regarding the 
makeup of the nda submission she said 
once submitted fda review of the data takes months for azt 
the fda moved at its quickest pace approving it in four months 
hoffmannla roche inc is distributing ddc to about 1000 
patients in clinical trials and about 1000 in an expanded access 
program said spokesman paul oestreicher 
company researchers will evaluate the data next month and 
determine whether it is favorable enough to go ahead with an nda 
he said 
dr gene zaglin a washington physician and a volunteer with 
project inform an aids education group estimated that as many as 
20000 people currently have no access to either drug but could 
benefit from them these are people who have aids or who are 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which 
causes aids

what some people initially believed was 
the tusk of a circus elephant shot in 1816 was actually that of an 
iceage mastodon museum officials said thursday 
using two methods of radiocarbon dating experts confirmed the 
tusk was 10500 years old it belonged to a mastodon that roamed 
maine when indians first ventured into the region the experts 
said 
whats so exciting about these dates is that until now we have 
had no evidence to suggest that the earliest indians might have 
hunted elephants in the maine region said archaeologist bruce 
bourque of the maine state museum 
museum curator gary hoyle learned about the tusk while seeking 
items for an exhibit on prehistoric maine 
museum officials believed the tusk was that of a creature that 
lived sometime around the end of the last ice age but we had to 
prove our analysis was right before putting it on display said 
paul e rivard director of the state museum 
the tusk about 4 feet long was unearthed in the southern maine 
town of scarborough in 1959 the discovery generated considerable 
interest which faded when stories circulated that the tusk 
belonged to a circus elephant shot in 1816 
research verified the bones of the circus elephant old bet 
were exhumed after a brief burial and sent to the american museum 
of natural history in new york 
samples of the tusk then housed at the university of maine at 
presque isle were taken to the state museum for radiocarbon 
testing 
rivard said confirmation of the tusks age provides the first 
evidence that mastodons lived in maine when indians first arrived 
in the area its the only mammal bone yet to be identified from 
the end of the ice age in maine 
this is an extremely important find rivard said 
several rib bones were discovered with the tusk 31 years ago 
but they cannot be located now experts believe the rest of the 
mastodons skeleton may still be at the site 
museum officials hope to conduct more extensive study of the 
site next year rivard said

case of toshiyuki inamura 55 a member of the house of 
representatives from prime minister toshiki kaifus liberal 
democratic party he served as director general of the environment 
agency from july 1976 to november 1987 
the party was rocked last year by a scandal over donations and 
discount stock deals for dozens of influential politicians 
bureaucrats and businessmen by recruit co an information services 
conglomerate accused of trying to influence government policy 
the affair led to the resignation of two prime ministers one 
to take responsibility for the scandal and the other to take 
responsibility for resulting election losses 
kaifu chosen for his clean reputation was installed as prime 
minister and vowed reforms to regain public trust in politics 
in the inamura case however the press reports said the stock 
earnings went for his personal use 
the reports in japans major national newspapers said inamura 
allegedly received 208 million in stock profits from 1986 to 
1988 and evaded taxes on at least 746 million 
some of his stock transactions allegedly were based on 
information from mitsuhiro kotani now on trial on charges of 
manipulating stock prices 
the reports said prosecutors searched inamuras home and offices 
on wednesday and questioned him wednesday and thursday 
they said he allegedly used the names of secretaries and 
supporters in his stock transactions to conceal his income

the justice department said thursday it would 
review a proposed 625 million deal between twa and american 
airlines to determine whether the sale of international routes and 
airport facilities would violate antitrust laws 
the department made its announcement after receiving a request 
for an antitrut investigation from sen john danforth rmo who 
opposes the sale 
danforth in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh said 
the proposed deal inevitably will lead to a dramatic reduction in 
domestic airline competition 
danforth is the senior republican on the senate commerce 
committee which handles airline issues and has been a leading 
critic of consolidation in the airline industry twa has a major 
hub of operation at the st louis airport 
american airlines earlier this week proposed buying all of twas 
routes from the united states to london and twas takeoff and 
landing rights at chicagos ohare international airport it also 
would acquire twas gates at the chicago airport 
gina talamona a spokeswoman for the justice department said 
the agencys antitrust division would look at the transaction 
proposed by the airlines she said the department would respond to 
danforths request but it routinely reviews major acquisition 
agreements involving airlines 
the route sales must be approved by the transportation 
department but danforth said the justice department has the power 
under antitrust laws to investigate and remedy market practices 
and structures that deny lowpriced competitive air service to the 
traveling public

the highest bishop of president bushs church 
just just back from baghdad thursday implored bush not to resort 
to war to force iraq out of kuwait 
presiding episcopal bishop edmond l browning said i really 
believe in the deepest part of my conviction that god does not 
desire this kind of destruction 
i dont think it would serve anybodys interests to say 
nothing about our national interests browning told reporters 
outside the white house after meeting with bush 
browning and 17 other us religious leaders met with iraqi 
religious figures in hopes of promoting a peaceful solution to the 
crisis they also stopped in cyprus and jordan 
browning said he told bush my belief from everything i heard 
on the trip and it confirmed my own conviction that war is not 
an option to solve the problems of either kuwait and iraq or any of 
the other middle eastern situation 
browning leader of the united states 25 million 
episcopalians said he told the president he believes this is a 
moment when theres the possibility for some real blessedness to 
happen to solve many problems in the middle east 
i said that i thought he could give that kind of moral 
leadership at this time in history he said 
bush asked browning how can we morally not do anything 
about iraqs takeover of kuwait according to the bishops account 
and he said the president said it is not appropriate to try to 
link the problems of the middle east together 
saddam hussein has attempted to link a kuwait solution to 
resolving the palestinian question and the white house has 
resisted such a linkage 
the bishop carried a copy of an amnesty international report on 
atrocities in kuwait that bush had given him 
bush told a congressional delegation earlier thursday that he 
had crossed a rubicon in his own mind in terms of being willing 
and able to use force and defend the principles involved white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
browning said bush did not use that metaphor in their meeting 
i hope that he hasnt crossed that line and i was trying to 
be as persuasive as i could calling upon his leadership to find 
another solution said the bishop

the united states on thursday joined in 
supporting a unanimous security council resolution that deplored 
israels deportation of palestinians and called for un monitoring 
of their safety 
it marked the first time the council moved to actively involve 
itself and the secretarygeneral in protecting palestinians in the 
israelioccupied territories seized in the 1967 middle east war 
arab diplomats called it a major step forward in achieving 
international protection of palestinins 
at the same time washington achieved a diplomatic victory over 
arab and nonaligned states in the council by preventing any 
reference to a middle east peace conference in the resolution the 
us demand had held up the vote for weeks 
instead the issue was included in a separate nonbinding 
statement by this months council president yemen which was 
approved by the council 
thursdays 150 vote was the third time in two months that the 
united states declined to exercise its veto and shield its israeli 
ally 
its vote was seen as a move to preserve the usled 
multinational coalition arrayed against iraqs saddam hussein a 
us veto on an issue considered vital to arabs could have 
undermined their confidence in the us persian gulf mission 
diplomats said 
the resolution asks un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to become involved in assuring the safety of palestinians 
in the territories and to monitor and observe the situation 
on an urgent basis 
it asks that un personnel and resources already in the region 
be used to help protect palestinians and that the security council 
be kept informed 
israel rejected any such deployment of un personnel and change 
of mandate of un organizations in the region to deal with 
palestinians its ambassador yoram aridor told the council we 
will not accommodate any discriminatory procedure or treatment 
the united states joined in opposing any change in the role of 
un organizations in the region 
it was not clear whether the councils call for monitoring could 
or would be carried out in view of israels oppostion 
diplomats said un personnel for any such observation team 
probably would be drawn from the un truce supervision 
organizaiton which has 291 military observers in the region or 
the un relief and works agency for palestinians in the middle 
east unrwa with a staff of 2300 staff provides social services 
for about 700000 palestinians 
israel rejects un involvement in what it calls its internal 
affairs in the territories 
plo observer m nasser alkidwa termed the resolution an 
important and substantive contribution to provide protection to the 
palestinian people under israeli occupation and contribute to 
resolution of the arabisraeli conflict 
american jewish groups denounced the us vote thursday the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith said washington fell into 
saddam husseins linkage trip it said the resolution still 
inflicts significant undeserved damage on israel 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said the resolution did not 
indicate a change in us policy on the middle east he said the 
us vote is intended to demonstrate our deep concern about 
the situation in the occupied territories 
but he also said the council ought to be willing to say to 
the palestinians that any use of violence to achieve their ends is 
plain wrong we lament the continued violence particularly in 
israel where innocent people have been the victims of numerous 
stabbings 
aridor complained bitterly in his speech that the council rushed 
to condemn israels decison to expel four moslem extremists 
believed linked to the recent murders of three jews but the 
blood of jews is not even worthy of a mention 
alkidwa of the palestine liberation organization said in an 
angry rebuttal that only israel was killing unarmed palestinians in 
the uprising against israel domination 
in thursdays separate statement the council said an 
international peace conference should facilitate a lasting 
resolution of the arabisraeli conflict but it said there was no 
agreement on when a conference shoud be held 
the united states sought to ensure the resolution did not link 
resolving the arabisraeli conflict with settlement of the gulf 
crisis 
to meet the us demand the presidential statement said the 
arabiraeli conflict was a separate issue and had to be addressed 
independently on its own merits 
unlike the resolution the presidential statement has no legal 
force 
in the resolution the security council deplores the decision 
by the government of israel the occupying power to resume 
deportation of palestinian civilians in the occupied territories 
israel has announced plans to deport four palestinians it claims 
have terrorist links 
security council efforts to address the palestinian problem 
began after the israeli police killed at least 17 palestinians at 
the alaksa mosque on the temple mount in jerusalem on oct 8 
the resolution urges israel to abide by the fourth geneva 
convention of 1949 regulating treatment of civilians in occupied 
lands israel says the convention does not apply 
the resolution asks perez de cuellar and the red cross to 
consider convening a meeting of the 164 signatories of the 
convention to consider what measures might be taken under the 
convention to help palestinians

a flamboyant mayor forced from office 
six years ago by a felony conviction can resume his old job after 
winning a recent election the state supreme court ruled thursday 
the court struck down two challenges to the eligiblity of 
vincent a buddy cianci jr to hold office 
cianci was forced to resign six years ago a city charter 
prohibited felons sentenced to prison time from holding office 
ciancis 10year reign as mayor was marred by public corruption 
and ended shortly after his 1984 conviction of felony assault on a 
man he thought was having an affair with his estranged wife 
he ran for mayor in the nov 6 election and won by 317 votes 
those challenging ciancis eligiblity to hold office argued that 
a 1986 state constitutional amendment prohibited felons from 
running for office until three years after finishing their 
sentences ciancis fiveyear suspended sentence ended in april 
1989 
the high court said the constitutional amendment did not apply 
to convictions that occurred before its adoption

a small group of replacement workers 
manned the countrys international phone lines thursday a day 
after riot police persuaded longdistance operators to end a 
strike 
wednesdays strike by operators loyal to the leftist sandinista 
front put the country out of touch with the outside world for five 
hours 
the strikers were acting to support about 400 telephone 
employees in three provinces south of the capital who stopped work 
two weeks ago to demand 40 percent salary increases 
ernesto robleto deputy minister of the state telecommunications 
company telcor said international lines were back under control 
thursday but only a handful of nonsandinista operators were 
working 
usually about 30 operators connect callers with mexico and 
central america while another 30 work calls to the rest of the 
world 
on thursday however a total of 15 replacement operators 
handled all calls directdial customers account for only about 5 
percent of calls 
the nonsandinista replacements were brought in after riot 
police were able to convince strikers to end their occupation of 
company telephone offices 
with so few operators international telephone lines to the 
outside world were jammed thursday and callers faced long waits 
especially to reach mexico and central america 
police units were stationed at the two main telcor buildings and 
access was restricted 
there are 4400 telecommunications workers nationwide 
nicaragua has been wracked by successive waves of labor unrest 
since president violeta chamorro won february elections ousting 
the sandinista government of president daniel ortega 
the sandinistas now in the opposition remain in control of 
much of the countrys workforce as well as its administration most 
telecommunications workers are holdovers from the leftist 
sandinista government 
sandinistaallied workers held national strikes in may and june 
that forced mrs chamorro to drastically modify her plans for 
cutting government spending 
the telephone workers now want a 40 percent pay raise reversal 
of the dismissals of 30 workers and a resumption of pay for the 
employees in the three southern provinces who started the strike 
robleto the telcor deputy minister said he decided to call 
riot police wednesday night when sandinista workers took over the 
rooms where international operators work 
about 18 riot police talked the strikers into leaving the 
occupied rooms where they had holed up for five hours 
the police told us that if we didnt leave the good way 
theyd make us leave the bad way said carlos olivares who has 
worked for three years as an international operator 
because most of our comrades are women we decided to leave 
peacefully we didnt want them to get hurt olivares said

the university of western ontario is letting 
professor philippe rushton return to the classroom saying it no 
longer fears his controversial ideas on race and intelligence will 
prompt violent protests 
since the beginning of this academic year rushton has been 
forced to tape his 90minute lectures on theories of personality 
students enrolled in the course are obliged to pick up the tapes 
view them and telephone the professor with any questions 
rushton created an uproar last year by announcing that his 
research showed whites are more intelligent than blacks orientals 
are more intelligent than whites and the reasons are genetic and 
evolutionary 
university officials said last fall that forcing rushton to tape 
his lectures was necessary to prevent possible disturbances on 
campus there had been a demonstration by about 300 students last 
spring 
rushton claimed the university was infringing on his academic 
freedom and disrupting the teacherstudent relationship 
im very happy to report that i have won the battle not to 
have to instruct by videotape rushton said wednesday in a 
telephone interview from his office at the university in london 
ontario 
im absolutely delighted he added im looking forward to 
it after the sterility of teaching by tape it will be a great joy 
to actually see fleshandblood students 
beginning with the new term beginning next month he will teach 
two courses introduction to personality and the psychology of 
prosocial and antisocial behavior 
this was simply the decision we had in mind all along said 
tom collins vice president for academics at the university 
things seemed relatively peaceful the first term said 
collins the protesting students seemed to understand and 
recognize that people have rights to teach and be taught and we 
are putting him back in the classroom in the belief that those who 
wish to protest will respect the rights of others 
rushton 46 has been at western ontario for 13 years he 
created an uproar in january 1989 when he described his theories 
during a 20minute talk to the american association for the 
advancement of science in san francisco 
describing his theories he says i conclude that on 50 or 60 
different measures orientals and blacks are at opposite ends of a 
continuum with whites or caucasoids falling consistently 
somewhere in the middle these measures include intelligence 
sexual behavior brain size lawabidingness social organization 
skills personality and temperament and speed of physical 
maturation 
rushton claims there is a virtual selfimposed taboo on the 
scientific study of race differences from a genetic perspective

thousands of jews many of whom were murdered in nazi death camps 
today after one year of life in liberty we as the 
representatives of slovakia feel the moral obligation to publicly 
declare to our fellow jewish citizens our remorse for this crime

carried by the state ctk news agency 
czechoslovakia was split in two during world war ii a german 
protectorate of bohemia and moravia was set up on the occupied 
czech territories

the president of a union local representing 
atlantic city casino workers on thursday denied federal charges 
that it is mobcontrolled 
it was the first public response from william roy silbert 
president of local 54 of the hotel employees and restaurant 
employees international union to a civil lawsuit filed by the 
justice department 
the antiracketeering lawsuit seeks control of the local which 
represents 22000 hotel bar and restaurant workers in atlantic 
city casinos and in other southern new jersey cities 
the lawsuit also seeks to restrict the unions international 
president from involvement in the locals affairs the removal of 
silbert and five other officials and the forfeiture of profits it 
says were obtained illegally 
the announced civil rico suit comes as a shock silbert 
said at a news conference referring to the racketeer influenced 
corrupt organizations statute 
my first reaction is one of outrage and any allegations 
that individuals others than local 54 members have influence on our 
activities are totally false he said 
the government knows that neither local 54 nor any of its 
officers have any mob ties or hidden agendas said silbert 
president since 1984 they know that we will not permit 
unionbusting to succeed 
the lawsuit alleges that the local has been controlled from 
prison by convicted mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo now 
serving a 70year federal prison term in marion ill for 
racketeering scarfo also has been sentenced to life for murder 
this is all fantasy union lawyer bernard katz said 
us attorney general richard thornburgh said the governments 
case was based on evidence gathered in more than two years of 
investigating including information from mob informants 
the government alleges scarfo handpicked silbert for the local 
unions presidency silbert succeeded francis gerace who was 
forced to step down by the casino control commission because of 
alleged mob connections 
thornburgh said a courtappointed trustee should run the local 
because mob members through their brutal and often deadly acts of 
violence and intimidation have destroyed the integrity of the union 
and its leadership 
the complaint also contended the mob helped keep control of the 
local by the 1973 killing of joseph mcgreal president of local 170 
in camden nj and the 1980 slaying of john mccullough who led 
the roofers union in philadelphia 
silbert in a threepage statement he read aloud said the 
accusations bewilder him 
none of us involved in local 54 activities have done anything 
wrong silbert said on the contrary we serve the cause of 
collective bargaining and membership representation in the finest 
manner perhaps that is why we are singled out for this vexing 
governmentinstituted litigation

the movement for multiparty democracy will pose the first major 
threat to the founder of the nation president kenneth kaunda and 
his ruling united national independence party since independence

amended the constitution on monday to legalize opposition parties 
previously he said multiparty elections for the presidency and the 
135member legislature now a rubberstamp body would be held 
before october 1991 
wina said the new party favors the promotion of private 
enterprise protection of human rights and guarantees for the 
accountability of elected representativee

wrecked the economy private enterprise has been discouraged civil 
rights have been violated and corrupt and inept politicians and

the military government on thursday took a 
step back from promises to install a multiparty democracy 
announcing that no political parties would be formed for at least 
another year 
the statement came the same day us ambassador harmon kirby 
said washington was more than doubling its aid to this west african 
nation to support its development and efforts to install 
multipartyism and respect for human rights 
kirby met thursday with togos leader gen gnassingbe eyadema 
the ambassador told reporters afterward that the us congress had 
decided to increase development aid to togo from a proposed 4 
million to 9 million for 199091 
in its announcement thursday togos ministry of interior and of 
security said the formation of political organizations was banned 
until the adoption of a new constitution scheduled for the end of 
1991 
the ban appeared aimed at inhibiting numerous political 
movements that have sprung up under the guise of social 
organizations since eyadema promised oct 30 to install a 
multiparty state it was not clear how they would be affected 
eyadema was forced to make the october announcement after togo 
was hit by the strikes and prodemocracy protests and riots that 
have swept west africa the past year 
in the worst violence police opened fire on rioters in lome on 
oct 5 killing three and wounding 34 by the governments count 
since promising democracy eyadema has tried to give the 
impression of moving toward more political freedom his critics 
remain unconvinced joking that eyadema wants a multiparty 
democracy without any political opposition 
his government has set up a commission to rewrite the 
constitution to allow political pluralism but no opposition 
leaders are among the 109 commission members eyadema has dismissed 
opposition demands that he step down or hold a national conference 
on democracy 
the general has ruled togo as a oneparty state since he seized 
power in a 1967 coup

rebel and government leaders began talks 
thursday aimed at formally ending liberias yearlong civil war but 
absent was a chief rebel commander 
charles taylor chief of the largest rebel group sent an aide 
to the talks and breakaway rebel leader prince johnson stormed out 
of the meeting saying he would not take part in any talks unless 
taylor also attended 
representing taylor at the talks was his aide tom woewiyu 
brig hezekiah bowen who commands the remnants of slain 
president samuel does army attended the talks sponsored by the 
economic community of west african states 
conference sources said johnson met with the leader of liberias 
interim government professor amos sawyer after he left the 
meeting and they expected he would be persuaded to return to the 
talks 
taylor has called sawyer a west african puppet and has rejected 
his offer to participate in his caretaker government which was 
chosen by liberian exiles and includes members of rebel factions 
taylor has previously insisted he must lead any interim government 
sawyers administration is installed in the liberian capital but 
a compromise on its composition is a major aim of the negotiations 
taylors forces control most of the country outside the capital 
of monrovia and his agreement is essential for a lasting peace 
johnson and bowen control most of monrovia 
gambian foreign minister omar sey opened thursdays meeting by 
urging the rivals to seize the momentum gained in bamako to avoid 
the recurrence of the scourge of violence and usher in a durable 
peace 
all three sides signed a ceasefire agreement in bamako capital 
of mali on nov 28 
under a west african peace plan neither sawyer the interim 
president nor his deputy would contest elections proposed next 
year to ensure voting is fair 
sey said delegates at the meeting will discuss how a fivenation 
west african intervention force sent to monrovia could police the 
ceasefire 
they will also negotiate the composition of an electoral 
commission and the rules for elections that will be overseen by the 
west african community and international observers he said 
more than 12000 civilians were killed and twothirds of the 
nations 23 million people were displaced by the liberian civil 
war which began last december when taylors forces invaded from 
neighboring ivory coast 
taylors forces invaded to overthrow doe whom they acused of 
human rights violations and nepotism but the fighting quickly 
degenerated into tribalbased killings

the bombers to full flying status as soon as possible 
the action marks the fifth time in less than two years that the 
bomber fleet has been grounded 
gen john t chain jr sac commanderinchief ordered the 
planes grounded after a b1b engine failed wednesday while flying 
near dyess air force base texas 
on oct 4 an engine on a b1b based at mcconnell air force 
base kan failed while the bomber flew over southeastern 
colorado 
in both cases the bombers landed safely and no one was injured 
b1bs have four engines sac said it suspected fan blades at the 
front of the engines caused the failures 
the grounding means that b1bs cannot be flown except for in 
case of war the bombers will remain on nuclear alert at us air 
bases ready for launch if needed 
the planes are permanently based at ellsworth air force base 
sd grand forks air force base nd dyess and mcconnell

with gen charles c mcdonald commander of the air forces 
logistics command in ohio logistics command is working with the 
engines manufacturer general electric to solve the problem sac 
said 
previous groundings occurred in march 1989 for fuel tank 
problems in april 1989 for escape hatch problems after a crash at

a white teaneck police officer whose 
fatal shooting of a black teenager set off rioting and charges of 
racism pleaded innocent thursday to reckless manslaughter 
officer gary spath 29 bowed his head in prayer before his 
arraignment in the april 10 shooting death of 16yearold phillip 
pannell the slain teenagers mother thelma pannell sobbed 
superior court judge charles degisi set bail at 50000 and 
released spath on his own recognizance the officer was suspended 
with pay after the shooting 
pannells death caused community leaders to reexamine race 
relations in teaneck a new york city suburb that had prided itself 
on tolerance since voluntarily desegregating its schools in the 
early 1960s 
spath an eightyear veteran of the teaneck police force and a 
partner responded april 10 to a report of a youth brandishing a gun 
near a schoolyard 
police said pannell was reaching into his pocket for a gun when 
spath shot him after a brief foot chase witnesses say the youths 
hands were raised above his head as if in surrender and an autopsy 
by a pathologist hired by pannells family supported that 
contention 
a candlelight vigil in honor of pannell the next night turned 
violent as mobs of angry teenagers overturned police cars smashed 
windows and looted stores 
if convicted spath faces up to 10 years in prison 
a grand jury in july refused to indict spath state attorney 
general robert del tufo immediately empaneled a second grand jury 
saying the county medical examiner botched the autopsy and tainted 
the first proceedings

the last statue of josef stalin to stand 
in a european capital was pulled down in pouring rain at the stroke 
of midnight thursday symbolizing the demise of stalinism 
throughout europe 
a crane hoisted the bronze statue of the soviet dictator onto a 
truck covered by a green cloth and lying on its back the monument 
was driven off to an undisclosed final destination 
the statues exit coincided with nexjime hoxhas losing her last 
important political post an official announcement said the 
68yearold widow of enver hoxha communist albanias stalinist 
founder retired because due to her age from chairmanship of the 
communistled democratic front 
the two events seemed meant to convey that albanias communist 
party is serious about abandoning its 46year legacy of harsh 
authoritarian rule 
the few people who witnessed the statues fall were happy to see 
it go although restrained by long repression from openly 
expressing their joy 
they were reluctant to talk to reporters and refused to give 
their names 
it was a moment which had to come said one worker 
asked if he thought this would be followed by demolition of the 
memorials to hoxha throughout albania another said no no 
stalin was a foreigner 
albania still has the last city in europe named for stalin who 
served as a model for hoxha after the albanian took power in 1944 
and imposed iron rule until his death in 1985 
stalins statue had gazed down on tirana since before stalin 
died in 1953 it occupied a spot on central square until it was 
moved in 1968 and its place taken by skanderbeg albanias 
15thcentury national hero 
a statue of vladimir i lenin founder of the soviet state 
still stands across from the vacant plinth where stalin stood 
in tiranas socalled student city the ramshackle room that now 
serves as headquarters for albanias first opposition party is 
reminiscent of the makeshift operations that bred revolution across 
eastern europe last year 
but the new democrats here face a much tougher struggle to 
overturn communist rule 
those who buzz around the new democratic party of albanias 
dilapidated headquarters seem undaunted 
a primitive duplicating machine clanks out copies of the partys 
program while a harried girl produces another document on an 
ancient typewriter three crudely made wooden chairs are available 
for visitors 
a slogan on a nearby wall reads freedom and democracy we 
need them now 
party founders dash in and out under the gaze of curiosity 
seekers many of whom still cant quite believe this change has 
come to albania 
gramoz pashko a tirana university economist who helped found 
the new party said their curiosity highlights the problems faced 
by the democrats 
these people were educated under a dictator he said 
theres this paternalistic psychology that you go to someone you 
know and knock on his door and your problem then gets solved or 
not 
albanians with grievances against the communists already have 
started flocking to the headquarters expecting help pashko said 
in the 10 days since protests over the slumlike student dorms 
in student city swelled into demands for democracy albanias 
nascent opposition has encountered numerous obstacles 
the biggest is the communist party one month ago albanias 
president and party leader ramiz alia contended there was no need 
for political pluralism in albania now he says a decision to 
permit other parties is irreversible 
nevertheless pashko said local communist officials still 
hinder party activists traveling to provincial cities to spread 
word of the new party 
the opposition also faces entrenched support for the communists 
in the media although the communist daily zeri i popullit or 
peoples voice reported the new partys registration thursday it 
gave no information about its program or leaders 
the democrats want their own daily to be called democratic 
renewal 
that probably will not be enough to counter communist efforts to 
maintain power 
the communists are playing tough cracking down on riots in four 
cities last week with a huge show of army and police force and 
handing out sentences of up to 20 years to those arrested 
the communists also seem likely to revamp themselves along 
reformist lines to confront the challenge from the new opposition 
mrs hoxhas loss of her last political position indicates alia 
is moving strongly against oldtime conservatives 
the communists are to hold a key meeting next wednesday when 
they are likely to announce a government reshuffle promised when 
the students first pushed for reform 
the communist partys election program also will be published at 
that time and democratic party spokesman genc pollo says he 
expects it to move the ruling party toward a more democratic path 
the opposition faces the threat of further violence when riots 
erupted in shkodra elbasan durres and kavaje pashko and other 
party leaders joined the communists in condemning the hooligans 
they contended were responsible 
the condemnation aroused suspicions that the new party is not a 
genuinely independent opposition 
party leaders insist this is a misunderstanding they plan an 
official protest over the trials of rioters who they say are being 
detained without adequate legal defense and are at times beaten

1978 qualls said 
ramos was arrested nov 18 and charged with 28 misdemeanor

prosecutors vowed to retry aissa waynes former husband thomas 
gionis and a jan 24 hearing was scheduled to consider the 
possibility of a new trial 
gionis 37 would not comment his lawyer john barnett 
maintained his clients innocence 
gionis faced a prison term of up to eight years 
he was charged with eight felonies including conspiracy and 
assault with a deadly weapon stemming from the oct 3 1988 
attack on miss wayne and her thenboyfriend roger luby 
miss wayne would not immediately comment on the mistrial 
the couple were attacked in the garage of lubys newport beach 
home miss wayne 34 and luby 54 were knocked to the ground and 
injured 
deputy district attorney christopher j evans said the attack 
was an attempt to intimidate miss wayne and prevent her from 
testifying in a child custody hearing involving their daughter 
anastasia now 4 
evans said gionis hired a private investigator who in turn 
hired two men to commit the assault the prosecutor relied heavily 
on telephone records showing gionis and private investigator o dan 
gal were in constant contact leading up to the attack 
juror diane brown who voted to acquit gionis said there was no 
actual proof that it was gionis on the telephone with gal 
just because he was in control of the home telephone and the 
car phone doesnt mean he was answering the phones brown said 
noting others had access to the telephones 
authorities were expected to reach a plea bargain arrangement 
with gal for his role in the case 
one of the attackers jerrel hintergardt 39 was convicted of 
assault and sentenced to eight years in prison 
jeffrey bouey 37 pleaded guilty to participating in the attack 
and he testified against gionis in a pleabargain deal with 
prosecutors he has yet to be sentenced

columbias astronauts said thursday 
they returned home with a rich harvest of scientific 
information gathered during their astronomy mission despite 
several technical problems 
the shuttle flights troubles that repeatedly delayed their 
stargazing efforts were widely publicized but the seven crew 
members said they believe they were successful in studying some of 
the hottest spots in the universe 
the astronomy results will be the proof of this mission 
columbia commander vance brand said at a news conference at the 
johnson space center it will take a few months for those results 
to come out but were hoping for very good results 
the 150 million astro observatory examined 135 celestial 
objects such as quasars stars and galaxies that emit xrays and 
ultraviolet waves that cannot penetrate the earths atmosphere 
that number was a little more than half the number scientists had 
hoped to achieve 
precious viewing time was lost during the recent nineday 
mission with the failures of two computer terminals and problems 
with an instrument pointing system a line that dumps wastewater 
overboard clogged but it didnt interfere with the observatorys 
work 
the problems often forced the four astronomers aboard the 
shuttle to manually guide the three ultraviolet telescopes toward 
celestial targets with a joystick and some guidance from ground 
controllers the xray telescope was unaffected because it had its 
own guiding system and was controlled by ground commands 
the manual process was cumbersome at first but the astronauts 
said they adapted fairly quickly 
we went up there to do astronomy and we could tell from what 
wed seen that we had reaped an immense harvest of data about 
ultraviolet astronomy said astronaut samuel durrance a payload 
specialist 
i think the final results will more than prove the benefits of 
this flight durrance said 
columbia landed dec 10 the same day the national aeronautics 
and space administration released results of a toplevel review of 
the program 
the review recommended shuttle flights be confined to those that 
require human involvement and that the proposed space station be 
redesigned completely 
the astronauts said their flight with its technical troubles 
was one that demonstrated the need to have astronauts in space when 
things go awry 
the other thing i think people will remember about this flight 
is how man was used to solve some pesky problems and continue 
on brand said

negligence by the city and former new york 
yankee infielder andre robertson were responsible for a 1983 car 
crash that left a ballerina unable to walk a jury decided 
thursday 
jurors were to return friday to determine monetary damages for 
shenikwa dawn nowlin who was left paralyzed from the waist down by 
the accident 
her lawsuit blamed the aug 19 1983 crash that broke her back 
on an improperly placed sign warning of a curve on manhattans west 
side highway she contended the sign was in the middle of the curve 
and therefore too late to warn drivers 
the jury agreed 
the panel found the city 67 percent liable and deemed robertson 
33 percent liable because he exceeded the 40 mph speed limit 
entering the curve nowlin was a passenger in a car driven by 
robertson 
nowlin 31 who uses a wheelchair and practices law in dallas 
said she was happy with the jurys findings 
by the age of 14 nowlin was dancing with the dance theater of 
harlem the youngest member of the corps 
she is seeking 20 million in damages 
all of a sudden i heard andre scream nowlin said of the 
accident he pushed on the brakes real hard and the car crashed 
to the left then it jerked to the right we hit the wall on the 
other side and my back just snapped 
robertson 33 left the texas rangers farm club and baseball in 
december 1989 he now works in a steam generating plant in orange

honduras which has served as a 
shelter for thousands of refugees the last decade has closed its 
doors to people fleeing other central american countries the 
government said thursday 
this is the new policy adopted by the honduran government 
because our economic situation wont permit it foreign minister 
mario carias said in an interview 
an estimated 150000 people from other central american 
countries had sought refuge in honduras the last 10 years but only 
1500 remain another offensive on the war in neighboring el 
salvador could send more refugees to the country 
if el salvadors civil war flares up again honduras cannot 
absorb new refugees of that nationality carias said 
carias said honduras has stopped accepting refugees because it 
is facing the worst economic crisis in its history 
international monetary agencies have said honduras is the 
poorest nation in central america 
it has a 600 million deficit and annual inflation is 40 
percent 
in the 1980s 80000 nicaraguans 60000 salvadorans and 1000 
guatemalans fled to honduras to avoid armed conflicts and social 
turmoil in their countries 
during the same period 13000 usbacked nicaraguan rebels had 
base camps in honduras 
the remaining refugees 1500 nicaraguans are slated to return 
home this month 
carias suggested that salvadorans displaced by the war be cared 
for in their own country 
with the permission of the salvadoran government the united 
nations should establish camps for the displaced within el 
salvador not in honduras to protect the civilian population he 
said

a parent may consent on behalf of a 
child to donate bone marrow to a sibling but only when it would be 
in the childs best interest the illinois supreme court said 
thursday 
justices made the ruling to explain their decision sept 28 to 
uphold a judges order refusing to force a leukemia victims young 
halfsiblings to be tested as potentially lifesaving bonemarrow 
donors 
the leukemia victim 13yearold jeanpierre bosze died nov 19 
at his home in the chicago suburb of hoffman estates after a 
twoyear illness 
in dealing with that case the high court cited three factors 
that must be weighed in future cases to determine when a parent or 
guardian can approve a childs being a transplant donor 
the parent or guardian must be informed of the risks and 
benefits inherent in the donation 
emotional support must be available to the child from his 
caretakers 
a close relationship must exist between the donor and 
recipient 
the evidence clearly shows that there is no physical benefit 
to a donor child wrote justice harold calvo for the courts 
majority if there is any benefit to a child who donates bone 
marrow to a sibling it will be a psychological benefit 
calvo said the psychological benefit is grounded firmly in the 
fact that the donor and recipient know each other as family 
jeanpierres father tamas bosze had petitioned for a court 
ruling to force nancy curran his former girlfriend and the mother 
of jeanpierres twin halfsiblings to have the 3yearolds 
tested as possible donors 
attorneys for the father and a courtappointed guardian for 
jeanpierre had urged the justices to order the testing of the 
twins on the legal theory that if the twins were adults they would 
agree to it 
however the high court refused to apply the legal doctrine of 
substituted judgment no dissents were filed 
because each twin is only 3 years of age neither has yet had 
the opportunity to develop actual specific express intent or 
any form of intent with regard to serving as a bone marrow 
donor calvo said 
edward jordan an attorney for the father said he was 
disappointed the court rejected his arguments but optimistic about 
cases to come 
we have established a framework that can save lives in the 
future he said 
charles fleck the courtappointed guardian for the twins 
applauded the justices for taking a common sense approach 
they didnt want to get into a brave new world situation 
where people start taking minors to save the life of mother teresa 
or the president or somebody else he said they focused on the 
best interests of the minor

federal premier ante markovic says 
slovenia has the right to hold a referendum on possible secession 
from yugoslavia and on thursday the constitutional court in 
belgrade backed his position 
the national parliament and federal presidency oppose the 
western republics plans to hold a plebsicite this sunday 
but the court rejected a parliamentary request for a temporary 
injunction forbidding the referendum to be held 
markovic said in an interview late wednesday it is the view of 
his federal government that it is the right of each republican 
parliament to decide on a referendum seeking the opinion of 
its citizens 
the citizens have the right to express their opinions 
and to reply to the questions posed 
he cautioned however it was a different question whether 
such a vote has legal consequences 
most of the 19 million slovenes were expected to vote for 
complete independence from yugoslavia now a federation of six 
republics and two provinces 
after slovenian deputies walked out wednesday parliament 
unanimously agreed the planned plebiscite was tantamount to 
secession from the federation 
it referred to an anticonstitutional act striving to impose 
on other yugoslav republics a solution irrespective of their 
rights and interests 
but the constitutional court rejected its request for an 
injunction the state news agency tanjug reported saying 
the plebiscite as a form of expression of the will of the 
people cannot be prevented and the constitutional court cannot 
base its decisions on suppositions about what the outcome will 
be 
this week yugoslavias collective presidency told markovics 
government to take indispensable but unspecified steps to 
preserve yugoslav unity 
markovic refused to say what his governments reaction would be 
to a referendum calling for slovenian independence 
slovenia ousted communists from power in free elections this 
year and is dissatisfied with the pace of democratic reforms in the 
rest of the country 
after the communists renamed socialists won overwhelmingly in 
the first free elections in the largest state of serbia on dec 9 
slovenian leaders intensified preparations for the referendum 
leaders of slovenia and neighboring croatia which also voted 
communists out of power have stressed they prefer to leave 
yugoslavia unless this balkan country of roughly 241 million 
people is turned into a loose confederation 
the serbs insist yugoslavia must remain a federation amid 
threats from the armed forces to intervene should national unity be 
threatened 
markovic insists it matters little what yugoslavia will be 
called as long as his radical reforms designed to introduce market 
economy are implemented 
he has won world praise for cutting back inflation boosting 
state reserves and making the dinar the national currency 
convertible 
under the constitution a republic can secede only if the other 
republics agree

organizers of a black economic boycott said 
thursday they would consider calling off the action if miami area 
politicians issue nelson mandela proclamations of welcome and keys 
to their cities 
boycott leader ht smith called on mayor xavier suarez miami 
beach mayor alex daoud and dade county commissioners to issue the 
keys and proclamations saying that would constitute the apology 
blacks demanded when they began the boycott five months ago 
nelson mandela is the living personification of self respect 
and human dignity smith said to disrespect him is to 
disrespect freedomseeking people everywhere who truly believe in 
civil and human rights for all 
at a press conference in miamis impoverished liberty city 
neighborhood smith said boycott organizers would deliver the keys 
and proclamations to mandela in south africa if the politicians 
prepared them 
an apology will not end the boycott smith said however 
once the foundation has been laid we can begin to work together to 
build a community where all people will be welcome 
smith criticized suarez recent statement that he regretted the 
way city officials handled the june visit of the antiapartheid 
leader saying it wasnt enough to end the boycott 
while we acknowledge that his statement is a sign of progress 
neither the content nor the context of mayor suarez statement 
indicate that it is an apology smith said 
suarez was in washington on thursday night and could not be 
reached for comment daoud said he would be very pleased to 
give mandela a proclamation of welcome and a key to his city 
we are very pleased to welcome mr mandela but not his 
friends daoud said they are enemies of the united states 
instead of the enthusiastic welcomes and ceremonies mandela 
received elsewhere on his us tour he got an official snub and 
criticism from suarez daoud and others because he refused to 
repudiate the african national congress staunch supporters fidel 
castro yasser arafat and moammar ghadhafi

earlier this week that eleven groups canceled their gatherings 
some planned as far in the future as 1993 costing the city nearly

with a mixture of gratitude and 
indignation panama on thursday observed the anniversary of last 
years us military invasion that ousted gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
that action itself cannot lead us to proclaim a national 
holiday because it was an invasion and no panamanian likes to see 
his country invaded with the consequences of deaths and 
injuries said foreign minister julio linares 
neither can we say it is a day of national mourning because it 
liberated us from dictatorship 
the government dubbed the date a day of national reflection 
while the families of panamanians killed in the invasion set a 
grand black march of protest for the evening 
hundreds of families left homeless by the invasion demonstrated 
for government housing at a rally that began wednesday night and 
lasted into early thursday 
families of victims killed in the invasion held a ceremony 
thursday honoring the dead at the side of a common grave where 123 
are buried 
one feels impotent in the face of the us presence in panama 
and the unconditional surrender of our leaders who to this day 
havent even been able to define what happened to panama 
victims family committee vice president arturo rodriguez said 
but the streets of panama city were mostly filled with christmas 
shoppers on anniversary morning and a scheduled picket of the us 
embassy did not materialize 
newspapers reflected the ambivalence that is the invasions 
legacy 
panama is a country with a future that is more promising every 
day and that is the principal difference between the country today 
and the country of one year ago the newspaper la prensa said 
but the daily la estrella warned against continued us military 
presence in the country 
our territorial integrity continues to be seriously damaged 
and at times disastrously compromised even by the federal 
government it said 
joint uspanamanian military patrols were scheduled to end 
this month and have not the us army was called out at president 
guillermo endaras request to put down a minor police revolt dec 
5 
about 10000 us soldiers are stationed in panama under the 
panama canal treaty providing security for the waterway about 
14000 other us troops participated in the invasion last year 
but all those soldiers were withdrawn 
there are varying estimates for the number of people who died in 
the invasion the panamanian human rights committee released recent 
figures showing that 403 people died or disappeared earlier it 
had put the number at 385 the us army southern command says 345 
died in the dec 20 invasion 
of the 1243 families left homeless by the invasion 596 whose 
dwellings were wrecked by bombs in the chorillo neighborhood where 
noriegas headquarters stood are still at a refugee shelter 
awaiting housing 
the country has been it by high unemployment and economic 
stagnation 
endara who came to the presidency following noriegas 
overthrow urged invasion victims to take courage 
we will preserve our democracy we will improve it every 
day he said on the eve of the anniversary

mikhail s gorbachev shocked by his foreign 
ministers resignation denied thursday his presidency was slipping 
toward dictatorship and condemned eduard shevardnadze for quitting 
in a time of crisis 
in an emotional speech to parliament shevardnadze accused 
hardliners of undermining economic and political reforms that he 
and gorbachev had worked on since 1985 putting the nation on the 
road to dictatorship the nearly 2000 legislators sat in stunned 
silence 
reformers have gone and hidden in the bushes he told the 
parliament his voice trembling dictatorship is coming 
in a speech later a somber gorbachev denied soviet democracy 
was threatened and accused shevardnadze of abandoning the nation in 
a time of ethnic conflict separatist movements in the 15 republics 
and food shortages 
gorbachev has sought authority to bypass parliament and use 
presidential decrees to deal with some of the nations crises many 
conservative soviet officials have urged gorbachev to take on even 
more sweeping powers 
the loss of shevardnadze one of the soviet unions two 
politicians with international stature was bound to hurt gorbachev 
as he faces domestic conflict and critical foreign policy issues 
such as the persian gulf crisis 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii paid 
tribute to shevardnadze and said im going to miss him but he 
said the resignation did not indicate a change in soviet foreign 
policy 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin also said soviet 
foreign policy was not likely to change as a result of the 
resignation 
i must say that our policy has a solid basis connected 
with the name of mikhail gorbachev and the minister of foreign 
affairs thinks that this policy will be continued churkin said 
in his speech gorbachev also expressed some personal betrayal 
noting he had planned to nominate the 62yearold diplomat for the 
vice presidency a post to be created under government 
reorganization 
for me shevardnadzes announcement came as a surprise that 
more than anything else to tell the truth hurts me he said 
standing under a giant portrait of lenin the whitehaired 
shevardnadze waved his finger at legislators and said he continued 
to support gorbachev but believed reactionaries were gaining 
power 
in a poignant conclusion to what he called the briefest and 
most difficult speech of my life he said i am resigning let 
be it my personal contribution protest if you will against 
dictatorship 
shevardnadze has won international praise since being appointed 
in 1985 by gorbachev who won this years nobel peace prize for 
foreign policy successes 
under shevardnadzes stewardship the soviet union pulled its 
troops out of afghanistan neotiated cuts in nuclear arsenals 
allowed east european countries to oust communist regimes and ended 
antagonistic relations with cold war foes 
but he has been heavily criticized in recent weeks by lawmakers 
especially a group of colonels in the legislature opposed to 
soviet involvement in the gulf 
it was unclear what impact the resignation would have on plans 
for a moscow feb 1113 arms control summit between gorbachev and 
president bush 
in bonn germany foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
thursday night he was confident of final soviet approval of the 
treaty guaranteeing german sovereignty despite shevardnadzes 
resignation the two men worked closely in the momentous year 
leading up to german unification last oct 3 and genscher said 
i find this resignation painful 
in his speech shevardnadze stopped short of criticizing 
gorbachev saying no one knows what kind of dictatorship there 
will be what kind of dictator will come and what order things 
will take 
i express my great gratitude to mikhail sergeyevich 
gorbachev he said i am his friend i think as he does i have 
always supported and will until my last day support the ideas of 
perestroika the idea of renewal the ideas of democratization 
but several lawmakers said they believed the courtly diplomat 
was protesting the swift growth of the presidents personal power 
i think mr gorbachev should take mr shevardnadzes statement 
as a real signal that he is going too far to the right said 
sergei stankevich deputy mayor of moscow and a member of the 
congress 
hardliners have urged gorbachev to declare a state of emergency 
in moldavia azerbaijan and shevardnadzes native georgia 
gorbachev has asked the congress to amend the constitution to 
strengthen his power 
but gorbachev assured the congress on thursday that there is 
no dictatorship here we are not talking about that but about 
strong power and we should not confuse them 
the president spoke slowly and calmly 
i dont want either to simplify the situation or overdramatize 
it he said the main thing is not to fall into panic or even 
worse hysteria 
gorbachev said he had spoken to shevardnadze twice by telephone 
after his resignation and persuaded him to remain as foreign 
minister until a replacement could be found 
with gorbachevs backing the congress voted 154052 with 111 
abstentions to ask shevardnadze to remain in his post 
but churkin the foreign ministry spokesman told reporters the 
resignation was irreversible 
gorbachev acknowledged errors and miscalculations have 
marred perestroika his program of political and economic reforms 
and brought hardships to the soviet people 
im not evading responsibility but i believe responsibility 
above all must consist in bringing this course to its logical 
conclusion so that it will produce positive results for our 
society he said 
for that reason such a step by comrade shevardnadze which 
he took without consulting the president i personally condemn 
the hardline soyuz faction in parliament demanded this 
month that shevardnadze be rebuked for soviet policy over iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
earlier the faction had demanded removal of vadim bakatin as 
interior minister for failing to crack down on republic 
independence movements days later bakatin was replaced 
in his speech shevardnadze cited the influence of hardline 
lawmakers with colonels stripes he said they have been able 
to remove the interior minister and now its time to settle scores 
with the foreign minister 
alksnis said shevardnadzes rsignation was a step in the 
right direction 
a commentator for the state news agency tass speculated 
shevardnadze could be replaced by yevgeny primakov a top gorbachev 
aide who most recently was sent to iraq in a diplomatic offensive 
to end the gulf crisis

a train slammed into a packed tour bus 
stalled on a rail crossing in southern taiwan on thursday killing 
25 people and injuring 35 authorities said 
police lowered the death toll saying earlier official reports 
of 42 dead and 14 injured were erroneous they attributed the 
mistake to chaos at the crash site 
railway police in kaohsiung about 230 miles south of taipei 
said the bus exploded in flames when it was struck by the 
taipeibound train about 630 pm 
police said there were 53 people aboard the bus they were 
mostly members of a farmers association in pingtung about 10 miles 
east of kaohsiung they were returning home from a meeting 
police said all the 25 dead were from the bus and they were 
still trying to identify several badly burned bodies most of the 
35 injured were hospitalized with serious burns and bone fractures 
police said 
the damaged train was left stuck on the tracks 
the train driver wang chinlang who suffered only scratches on 
the leg told state radio broadcasting corporation of china that 
the train was traveling at 74 mph when he saw the rear of the bus 
i tried to stop the train but it was too late we were lucky 
the train did not derail after the collision he said 
wang fengtang a passenger on the bus said she managed to jump 
out of the bus and escape the explosion 
police said an initial investigation showed the bus apparently 
had passed the railway crossing in suburban kaohsiung and turned 
into an alley but backed onto the tracks when the driver found the 
alley too narrow 
in the previous worst bus accident 41 people were killed when a 
bus plunged into a river bank in central taiwan in 1986

riyadh saudi arabia the pentagon warned saddam hussein today 
that us air power will be ready to attack iraq by jan 1 even 
if all ground forces are not ready for war by that unimposed 
deadline for him to withdraw from kuwait 
the statement came from a top aide to defense secretary dick 
cheney the morning after a senior us commander here raised 
eyebrows by saying american ground troops might not be ready to 
fight iraq until a month or more past the united nations deadline 
and that he would urge president bush not to order any attack until 
the full us deployment was ready for war 
cheney spokesman pete williams said cheney was not 
displeased by lt gen calvin ah wallers candid assessment 
still todays statement by williams and other comments by 
senior military officers here appeared clearly designed to give the 
deadline more teeth to counter any interpretation of wallers 
remarks as possibly undermining bushs demand that saddam meet the 
deadline or risk attack

when japan oustripped the united states as the 
world leader in foreign economic aid last year the west still 
found plenty to criticize 
japans interests were largely regional its loans and grants 
mainly commercial and its overall program lacked a strategic plan 
analysts say however that the japanese way may suit the new 
era or at least put japan a step ahead of its chief critic the 
united states 
the passing of the cold war signals the end of the strategic 
foreign aid washington traditionally provided to noncommunist 
developing nations 
both japan and the united states now say they will begin to make 
democratic progress a condition of foreign assistance 
freemarket democracies are springing up everywhere however 
and analysts say japanesestyle economic criteria for aid market 
stability and potential return on investment probably will take 
precedence over the ideological 
some us congressmen already are calling for a review of 
american aid urging washington to weigh the needs of recipient 
countries against the pressure to help american business 
also the regional focus that has led japan to direct most of 
its aid to asia to help build a trade bloc may become the norm 
the european community is preoccupied with bolstering the former 
communist nations of eastern europe as it prepares for unification 
as a huge trade bloc in 1992 the united states has forged closer 
regional ties with canada and mexico 
the whole basis for aid rationale at least from the american 
perspective is gone said robert m orr jr author of the 
emergence of japans foreign aid power 
fuchen lo an aid expert at united nations university in tokyo 
said the us will have to change its strategy more than japan 
will 
economies in latin america and the middle east where about half 
the american aid goes remain troubled while japanese aid has been 
largely successful in asia 
aid to asean has turned out to be japans best investment in 
the last 30 years lo said 
in the beginning japan got raw materials from members of the 
association of southeast asian nations which is made up of brunei 
indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand 
since the more valuable yen began driving up export costs japan 
has transferred industry and technology as part of aid to asean 
countries much to its profit and theirs 
with nationalist pride growing stronger in the world japans 
nonmoralistic approach to aid is proving popular 
we are happy because the japanese carry out aid by request 
without preconditions said bunyaraks ninsananda director of 
planning for thailands office of the national economic and social 
development board 
we know what is best for our country he said at a recent 
aid conference we dont feel like having a big brother coming 
along and telling us what to do 
under the direction of four different government agencies japan 
distributed 9 billion of foreign economic aid in 1989 surpassing 
the 77 billion provided by the united states 
we have no overall political strategy because of all the 
competition between bureaus involved in giving aid so japan has 
had to depend on economic criteria a government official in 
charge of development programs said on condition of anonymity 
quite by accident that has worked out well 
the official said he did not expect much change although there 
is a growing percentage of purely humanitarian aid not tied to such 
commercial interests as japanese construction companies seeking to 
build overseas 
even humanitarian aid sometimes produces strange results orr 
said a huge luxury hotel was built in dhaka with japanese loans to 
bangladesh one of the worlds poorest countries 
when japan does take a moral position a combination of 
bureaucratic infighting and financial pressure can subvert it 
commercial and financial pressures probably played a part in the 
decision last july to resume a loan program to china that was 
frozen after the army assault on prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijing in june 1989 
in march 1989 japan broke ranks with the west and resumed aid 
to burma which had cracked down on student protesters the year 
before 
the foreign ministry wanted the aid suspended but two other 
ministries finance and international trade and industry thought 
the suspension might cause financial chaos and force burma to 
default on more than 60 million in loans 
one reason japan may put more emphasis on democratic development 
in countries receiving aid is that major donor nations in the 
postcold war era need an excuse to turn away the legions of 
petitioners 
japan often said we really dont care about a regime we 
care about stability orr wrote they would give money to 
countries the us wouldnt touch with a tenfoot pole 
but today countries that lag behind in democracy and market 
progress like bulgaria and romania are going to get short shrift 
from japan

egypt was an ancient religious 
land under the stranglehold of neros rome when the first strains 
of christianity came quietly and swiftly across the sinai desert 
from judea 
how did the new religion arrive who were the first christians 
what were the early teachings and how did the message spread and 
change legends and stories are far more plentiful than facts 
german archaeologist peter grossmann who specializes in early 
christian sites of the near east is trying to unlock the 
mysteries his expeditions often take him into the sinai and to the 
oasis of firan 
for five seasons grossmann has dug in the ruinrich hillsides 
above firan where pagans who drifted there 1700 years ago became 
christian converts 
most archaeologists prefer to bypass christian relics in egypt 
for more lucrative digs for relics of the pharaohs 
british archaeologist michael jones who is based in cairo says 
grossmanns work is important because everything we believe as 
western christians everything we know about early christianity 
began in places like this and yet we know so little 
old testament scholars know the oasis as paran where hagar and 
her son ishmael found refuge after they were banished by abraham 
and as the vale of elim a welcome stopover for the children of 
israel during the exodus 
at firan a haven of date palms and wells in the stark sinai a 
crumbling mudbrick cathedral dominates the ruins of an ancient 
settlement 
grossmann supervising diggers who extracted a toppled column 
took a break to climb toward the crumbling walls of the ancient 
basilica the mountains overlooking the oasis contain yet more 
ruins including hermitages and monasteries 
although the pagansturnedchristians left evidence of their 
years at firan much of it was destroyed by bedouin raiders or 
washed away by frequent flash floods 
egyptian christians date their church to the first century when 
mark the apostle brought the new religion to alexandria few 
records exist because many of the earliest converts were poor with 
little more than their faith to pass down 
third century roman emperors persecuted egypts christians 
church records were destroyed but the religion was kept alive from 
wilderness caves by hermits and monks preaching the virtues of 
sacrifice to flocks of believers 
early hermits who sought to communicate with god in egypts 
deserts by practicing a life of selfdenial called the desert 
fathers lived on mount serbal which rises above the oasis and on 
mount sinai a few miles away 
both mountains were reputed to be the site where god gave moses 
the ten commandments but by the fourth century most christians 
believed mount sinai was the one 
grossmanns history of firan begins in the first century when 
pagans wandered into the oasis and ends with islams conquest of 
christian egypt seven centuries later 
firans first converts to christianity were the nabateans 
mysterious bedouin tradesmen and shepherds who roamed the desert 
with their flocks 
the nabateans left more than 1000 archaeological sites some 
were masterpieces like the nabatean capital petra in southern 
jordan where part of the movie indiana jones and the last 
crusade was filmed some were simple like remains left by sinai 
nabateans who barely eked out an existence 
grossman thinks the nabateans originally came to the 
inhospitable sinai seeking work in the turquoise mines and were 
attracted to firan by its water and food 
they built a pagan temple and on surrounding rocky hillsides 
hundreds and hundreds of tombs 
when a burial was prepared it would take three days or so for 
everybody to get together grossman said the oasis was a nice 
place the family might remain a week or two 
drawings the restless nabateans scribbled on boulders and 
elsewhere while awaiting funerals produced a record of their 
transition from paganism to christianity early drawings depicted 
camels and riders later nabateans drew crosses 
the archaeologist said he does not know why the nabateans became 
christians but once they settled into oasis life he said they 
quickly found a way to improve their lot by making money from 
other christians 
a popular way for early christians to prove their faith was to 
trek from the churches of old cairo through sinai up mount sinai 
and back to cairo luxuriant firan became a way station on the 
arduous pilgrimages 
one pilgrim was emperor constantines mother helena who stopped 
at the oasis in 337 
firan later had its own bishop and basilica but its prominence 
was shortlived a religious dispute robbed it of outside financial 
help and pilgrimage caravans dwindled because of bedouin raiders 
just as mount serbal lost its popularity contest with mount 
sinai so firan lost its fame and importance to a fortress built at 
the base of mount sinai the monastery of st catherine 
the greek orthodox monastery of st catherine is now one of 
grossmanns sponsors along with the german archaeological 
institute in cairo

in one corner children playing the part of 
unskilled laborers shuck clay oysters from real shells upstairs 
others working as printers make the labels that decorate cardboard 
cans for the seafood 
meanwhile in the front office a child wearing the owners top 
hat sits with his visored clerk and hands out the days wages 
its all part of a new handson museum exhibit at the baltimore 
museum of industry where the hard life of an oyster shucker and the 
impact of the canning industry on baltimore are brought to life 
the cannery exhibit which opened in midoctober allows 
children to participate in every step of the canning business as 
practiced in the late 1800s 
it gives them the background it gives them the history it 
tells them how important the canning industry was to the city in 
the 1880s said jeanne franklin spokeswoman for the museum 
the children apply for jobs in the mock cannery are put to work 
and paid in tokens each child plays a character such as sandy 
platt the collegeeducated 71yearold cannery owner who lives in 
a tony neighborhood 
another child plays the role of albert harrison 11 an 
illiterate black shucker who works in the cannery with his father 
what about a work permit a fifthgrade student asked during 
a recent tour 
most children do not have any idea a lot of children did not 
go to school in the 1800s that they worked from the age of 12 
franklin said this gives them an idea of the difference between 
skilled and unskilled labor 
there are about 30 roles available but the most used at one 
time is 24 the characters taken from the 1880 census include an 
illiterate immigrant irish widow who works filling cans a 
17yearold polish printers apprentice who can read and write the 
head of the canmakers union and others 
after they are done with the 90minute session the children 
visit the general store to see what their labor was worth in the 
1880s and answer a computer questionnaire 
about 350 children participated in the first two months school 
groups provide the players on weekdays but the exhibit is open to 
all comers on weekends 
the cannery idea came from another exhibit in which children put 
together cardboard cutouts of automobiles on a mock assembly line 
said sheila garred the museums education director 
it gives them an idea that baltimore has gone through a lot of 
changes that people used to do things here that they dont do 
anymore said garred 
it also gives them the idea that the work people do determines 
what the city is like she said its harder to see now because 
a lot of people commute to work and children dont see what effect 
that work has on the city they live in they dont live right next 
to the plant their father works in 
the exhibit financed by a 185000 grant from the national 
endowment for the humanities is housed in a cannery building from 
1865 
baltimore was an early center of the canning industry boasting 
100 canneries in 1880 canning ranked second only to the garment 
industry in baltimore in the number of workers and the value of the 
product 
about 90 percent of the cannery workers were men at their peak 
canneries employed more than 8000 shuckers primarily unskilled 
blacks ten percent of the citys black males were employed as 
piecework shuckers in 1880 
the most highly skilled workers were the canmakers who learned 
their trade as apprentices most were white and of german descent 
machines replaced all the canmakers by 1910 and by 1960 all of 
the canneries had moved to rural areas baltimore where cans are 
still manufactured produced and shipped more empty cans than any 
other city in the country until the 1950s 
franklin said that in addition to teaching children about the 
citys past the exhibit teaches a more current lesson 
it gets them thinking about career paths and their future 
she said it also shows them how machines changed the way people 
work and how machines still change the way we work

if ghosts do walk in the dim sanctuary of the 
renovated ed sullivan theater on broadway they must be pleased by 
the theaters newest tenant highdefinition video 
the theater home to vaudeville musical comedy radio and tv 
studios has its newest proprietor in david niles a pioneer in 
highdefinition television whos also known by the nickname captain 
video 
a slender softspoken man with a scholars slouch and a 
hippies graying mane tied back in a sedate queue the captain 
stands in a control room off the stage where sullivans variety 
show introduced the beatles to american tv 
our whole generation our whole present culture is really a 
product of what came off that stage niles said 
the captain a loving restorer and conservator of the beautiful 
old theater is also a prophet of the next mass communications 
medium 
he is determined that by late march or early april the old 
theater will be the first highdefinition video environment in 
the united states 
the visitor walks up to the 450seat balcony where a wide wide 
screen floats in the darkness above the theater floor where niles 
has installed working hdtv production studios 
the lights go out and up on that screen we have a 12foot by 
42foot continuous seamless highdefinition image which is 
pretty awesome he said 
indeed it is 
the 1125line image flashes out of four hdtv projectors made 
by the barco company of belgium and onto a customized high 
reflectance screen made by the stewart filmscreen co a us 
company 
the stereo sound system eighttrack digital and synchronous 
plays through usmade klipsch loudspeakers powered by usmade 
mcintosh amplifiers 
he shows an excerpt of his short feature on macys thanksgiving 
day parade the colors are bright and real the picture is sharp 
and dense with individual faces recognizable in crowds 
then he plays couple of music videos he produced including one 
from mtvs unplugged series featuring the rock band ratt 
playing acoustic instruments instead of thrashing heavymetal 
guitars 
the gorgeous imagery and fullthroated soundtrack have a force 
and presence that are aweinspiring only people who have 
experienced it can understand that its not just better tv its a 
whole new way of seeing and hearing 
niles is determined to show that hdtv is not some futuristic 
concept it is reality in the here and now 
one of the sullivans first highdefinition shows will be in 
alternative media a twoweek limited engagement of the opera 
wr and peace with a cast of 200 
heres an opera that took place in seattle about four or five 
months ago that was captured in highdefinition he said well 
be able with the highest quality of image and sound possible to 
present it again in this environment 
niles said his first regular show for the space has the working 
title the new york sensation and is almost like a themepark 
ride showing highdefinition vistas street scenes and other 
images of the city 
he will charge an asyetunestablished price of admission 
since taking the theaters lease in january 1989 hes renovated 
the building and installed the highdefinition video production 
studio 
we just took the time and did it intelligently he said 
pointing up at the dark ribbed gothic revival dome above of what 
once was one of broadways most sumptuous entertainment palaces 
i painted that part of the ceiling 
its altogether fitting that the theater become the first us 
showcase for highdefinition video it opened as hammersteins 
theater in 1927 and saw a succession of flops including cary 
grants first us theatrical appearance 
showbiz entrepreneur billy rose and gangster lucky luciano 
converted it into a naughty cabaret 
then in 1935 cbs established its first big radio studio in the 
theater it saw orson welles war of the worlds broadcast the 
original amateur hour and countless other shows 
then as studio 50 the networks first big tv studio it saw ed 
sullivans weekly variety show jackie gleasons first 
honeymooners episodes and many other other tv shows until cbs 
entertainment productions moved to los angeles 
the last program to originate in the theater was the sitcom 
kate and allie 
now its niles turn 
the values that were portrayed and the ideas that were 
communicated and the things that were introduced all of the 
other stuff came off that little piece of geography just a couple 
of square feet he said 
so many people had their careers made on this stage so much 
energy was used here as this place evolved its in the walls he 
said 
i dont believe in ghosts but its a good feeling 
 
elsewhere in television 
canadian funny humor dept hbo at midnight tonight brings back

one of the more terrible punishments that can be 
inflicted by economic events is uncertainty and during this 
holiday season it is present in lumps like coal in a christmas 
stocking 
fundamental changes are under way and about all that can be 
said about them is that they will deeply affect the way people 
live for better or worse 
business is reassessing its employment practices and chances 
are that more people will lose their jobs interest rates are 
falling which will benefit many but undermine the plans of those 
who live off interest payments 
some of the banks are in trouble many insurers also are likely 
to face difficult decisions about writing off assets lots of small 
businesses are likely to fail over the next few months bigger ones 
might have to cut dividends 
perhaps the only people who claim to like uncertainty are those 
who believe they can benefit from it to them change is 
opportunity but even they doubt because experience shows that 
many will reach for the brass ring and miss it 
grim as the current changes may seem however no american 
should forget the bigger picture give yourself a christmas gift 
and think about it 
economic downturns are natural and inevitable no powers 
invented by humankind have ever been able to keep economies from 
ups and downs and probably that is a good thing 
the american economy has always recovered from recessions and 
come back bigger and stronger and usually healthier than before 
thats not theory but fact 
downturns correct imbalances not all of them but they do tend 
to set many things straight that should have been corrected 
earlier 
workers for example become more dedicated businesses more 
productive waste is reduced solid values are reaffirmed 
there is a tendency during upturns to throw away the old 
guidelines and believe that humankind has entered a new era of 
affluence old disciplines are trampled their believers are 
scorned 
when the downturn comes the old anchors of behavior generally 
healthier and more productive ones are reinstated for a while 
anyway 
downturns and the corrections they force upon us are the 
foundations of economic ascents the pain that recessions bring 
generally is not wasted but remains as a constructive lesson to be 
remembered when times improve 
nobody can say how long these bad times will last that is 
simply an uncertainty that people must live with but recessions 
lasting more than a year have become rarer in part because we know 
what actions to take against them 
those actions already are under way the federal reserve which 
has been unusually cautious about allowing funds to flow into the 
economy has now eased the pressure interest rates are falling 
inflation is down 
there will be immediate relief for some financial institutions 
businesses and people home mortgage rates especially variable 
rates but also new fixedrate loans already are less expensive 
they will become more so 
banks with help from regulators will be getting their affairs 
in order they will be writing off nonperforming loans they will 
be making deals with their hardpressed business customers that 
will help those customers survive 
viewed from a certain perspective a rosy one perhaps the 
process of recovery is already beginning although it might take a 
long while to produce much evidence old business and old notions 
are being cleared from the books 
those who say they know when the economy will improve again are 
probably talking nonsense at this point but judging from the past 
there is evidence to support the notion that when the gloom is 
deepest the worst may be over

a familiar but exhilarating sight billowing 
thousands of brightly colored helium balloons soar into the air 
get caught by the wind disappear into tiny points against the sky 
and kill thousands of helpless animals 
that anyway is what many of the nations children believe and 
its giving the balloon industry a severe gas attack 
jackie simms 11 says her fifthgrade classmates in kent ohio 
cant understand why people launch balloons just for enjoyment 
they know that it does kill the animals and it does litter the 
ground too she said 
americas balloon sellers say they are in a battle for kids 
hearts and minds and theyre losing 
the children dont want anyone to buy balloons anymore said 
philip levin president of balloon city usa a national wholesaler 
in harrisburg pa 
the schoolchildren are the ones that go to the state 
legislators and say we should ban balloons levin said crying 
children say were killing millions of animals 
the balloon industry disputes any suggestion that animals on 
land or at sea have been harmed by eating stray helium balloons 
this office has yet to have evidence that a balloon has been 
the primary cause of death in any case said mark brown director 
of communications for the national association of balloon artists 
in jacksonville fla 
these misinformation reports are turning into an attack on our 
industry brown said children say oh no i cant take that 
balloon it might kill a whale 
florida connecticut and tennessee have enacted laws banning or 
restricting balloon launches under pressure from schoolchildren 
several cities have passed similar ordinances or have declared 
balloon launches a form of littering 
the association says the ruckus is costing balloon sellers 6 
million a year many customers have canceled orders for earthbound 
balloons as well even though the controversy directly relates 
only to the release of lighterthanair models 
the dispute traces back to 1985 when a dead whale washed up in 
new jersey robert schoelkopf of the marine mammal stranding center 
in brigantine nj found a mylar plastic balloon in the whales 
stomach that kind of balloon is not used in launches which are 
done exclusively with balloons made of latex a kind of rubber 
although there are no documentations of animals dying directly 
from ingestion of balloons we think it has been a contributing 
factor schoelkopf said 
in 1987 science teachers susan and peter hibbard in toms river 
nj founded the balloon alert project after finding a white latex 
balloon inside a dead leatherback sea turtle 
we never said it caused the death of the turtle but it was in 
the turtle where it did not belong mrs hibbard said 
asked about the industry assertion that there has been no proof 
any animal was ever killed by a balloon she said they cant 
prove that the balloons havent killed any animals as far as the 
litter problem we can prove it 
linda maraniss regional director of the center for marine 
conservation in austin texas says annual beach cleanup drives 
have collected tens of thousands of balloons nationwide 
in florida we found a balloon from a ford dealership in 
georgia she said you can read abels they do drift 
the balloon industry says most helium balloons climb about five 
miles high where they burst into tiny pieces of latex brown said 
latex is a natural biodegradable material that decays at about the 
same rate as oak leaves 
then you have to ask yourself how long it takes an oak leaf to 
degrade ms maraniss replied 
at bromfield school in kent jackie simms and the other students 
in the fifthgrade class taught by patricia moore are doing 
experiments to see how fast balloons degrade 
we have oak leaves and balloons on trays outside mrs moore 
said weve made a chart of research for and against balloon 
launches 
the class wrote letters trying to get city officials in nearby 
ravenna to call off a balloon launch dec 7 but failed they got a 
letter from the mayor and a visit from local balloon dealer kurt 
mclaughlin who tried to change their minds 
most of it made sense but he couldnt answer some of the 
things we said 10yearold lisa bowe reported 
i like balloons i just dont like them floating away into the 
air she said many animals will eat them and die 
theres no question this has hurt sales said mclaughlin 
president of roaring silence balloons and cookies in kent we 
know we have lost 50000 in income that we can show proof of 
because balloon launches are no longer an acceptable activity 
he spoke nostalgically of the mid1980s when it seemed no 
celebration was complete without helium balloons ascending into the 
sky 
it will be a while before our industry gets back to where it 
was mclaughlin said

iraq and much of the rest of the world stand 
at the brink of war threatening the most damaging confrontation 
since world war ii with unmeasurable reverberations 
to most people it looks like a historical clash 
to francis fukuyama it looks like a footnote 
fukuyama became momentarily famous in washington a year ago by 
audaciously suggesting in a learned essay that history had ended 
finis the west had won and that was that 
in fukuyamas world view the iraqi adventure is the stuff of 
headlines but not great history not what he means as history 
thats the rub he readily concedes that history by his 
definition is not the random chronicle of events that passes for 
history as the term is ordinarily used 
he has in mind history the way it was treated by georg wilhelm 
friedrich hegel a german philosopher at the end of the 18th and 
start of the 19th centuries whose ideas influenced both hitler and 
stalin 
history in the hegelian sense is the clash of ideas over how 
mankind should order its affairs history says fukuyama has ended 
with the decline of communism because the major societies have 
stopped struggling over rival ideologies and reached a consensus 
about the ultimate system for governing themselves 
the winner democracy and capitalism 
thus the persian gulf conflict is a pinprick ideology is not at 
stake 
if fascism a defeated ideology once in competition with 
communism and democracy were to take root in the soviet union 
said fukuyama that would be historic 
in an interview fukuyama said it was wrong for persian gulf 
developments to get bigger headlines than the reunification of 
germany which he described as the event of the decade 
iraq is basically a country ruled by a tribe all relatives of 
saddam hussein like a mafia family resembling the politics of 
16thcentury italy he said 
and saudi arabia is a bureaucratic monarchy resembling the 
european state of five or six centuries ago 
i didnt say the world is going to be free of conflict 
fukuyama said 
but third world struggles simply are not over the principles 
that govern mankind 
fukuyama says he was misunderstood a year ago and if detractors 
would read more carefully they would find they are not even talking 
about the same thing 
fukuyamas essay which appeared in a small conservative 
quarterly the national interest concluded with a statement that 
perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of 
history will serve to get history started once again 
diplomats discussed his theory in plush places magazines in 
europe and asia translated his article and quoted him newspapers 
featured him in long essays his theory reached the status of a 
doctrine 
fukuyama who has spent most of his adult life on college 
campuses had worked for the state department for only a year 
his idea made its first appearance as the topic of a lecture 
delivered in chicago in 1988 it caught attention as a heavily 
footnoted 16page essay a year later the national interest ran 
learned rebuttals and comment in subsequent issues fukuyama got 
the last word with an eightpage goodnatured but firm reply 
the chicagoborn yale cornell and harvardeducated fukuyama 
now works for the rand corporation a private think tank during an 
earlier stint with rand in california he met his wife laura they 
have two young children 
he hopes to return to government but is busy these days turning 
endism into a book he avoids public appearances and works in 
an unmarked office strewn with books and papers struggling to 
meet a publishers deadline 
he dismisses speculation that his essay was intended to 
articulate a we won doctrine for the bush administration 
i am a relatively junior official with little impact on 
policy he said i am constantly amazed at the parochialism of 
the political class in washington 
fukuyama said his ideas were aimed at a professional audience 
and it surprised him when they were translated into 13 or 14 
different languages and set off little debates in places where you 
wouldnt expect it to happen portugal indonesia south korea 
lithuania the soviet union 
apparently people sensed that very great things were happening 
in the world he said 
he emphasized that what i have said is simply that liberal as 
opposed to authoritarian ideas won not any particular liberal 
country called the united states has won it does seem to me that 
we americans really have a lot of great problems economic 
primarily relative to other democracies 
of course there are countries at lower levels of development 
such as iraq but they are basically irrelevant to the grand 
historical process fukuyama said 
unlike nazi germany or the soviet union before mikhail 
gorbachev they dont challenge democracy as the ultimate standard 
for mankind 
but he noted that the soviet union offers fascism perhaps its 
best chance of revival writers in some russian journals speak a 
language unheard in europe for many years and are uncomfortably 
close to the soviet mainstream 
fukuyama made his debut as a congressional witness at a recent 
senate foreign relations committee hearing 
he told the senators it was an ironic accident of fate that we 
should be faced with a geopolitical crisis just as the cold war is 
ending allowing people to mistakenly feel that kind of world will 
be continuing

of course it helps but you dont have to be a 
ford or a rockefeller to establish a foundation 
or rich 
or old money 
you can do it as a comfortable but notquiteweathy middleclass 
member of one of the countrys racial and ethnic minorities 
foundations that hand out money have been established by scores 
of melting pot americans like joe shoong a chinese immigrant 
merchant or mary carmen saucedo a hispanic retired school 
administrator or lonnie porter a black janitor who died at age 93 
and left his 100000 lifes savings to set up an endowment that 
supports students at the united theological seminary in dayton 
ohio 
increasingly reports the council on foundations a resource 
house for 1200 grantmaking organizations members of racial and 
ethnic minorities are creating foundations to help their own kind 
or society in general 
it requires money but not a fortune the council says 2000 
can make you a fullfledged philanthropist a regular rockefeller 
with a fund bearing your family name and perpetuating your good 
intentions into eternity 
the classic case is le ly hayslip 
once a south vietnamese peasant she married an american came 
to this country opened a restaurant succeeded in business was 
widowed went back to vietnam was appalled at the poverty there 
and returned to california she sold her restaurant and two of the 
three houses she owned and with the proceeds established the 
east meets west foundation 
it earmarks earnings to help people in mrs hayslips native 
land recover from the wounds of war providing medical equipment 
and supplies to hospitals and village clinics one program enables 
americans to support vietnamese families whose fathers and sons 
were severely disabled in the war 
sensing that the benevolent traditions of americas black 
hispanic asianamerican and american indian communities are an 
untold story the council on foundations assigned karen lynn a 
member of its staff to investigate 
ms lynn came to the council from five years at united way of 
chicago after a twoyear study she has written a report that 
concludes 
looking beyond the perception of minorities as the recipients 
of charity you will find these communities have always been 
benevolent american indians asians blacks and hispanics have a 
strong tradition of selflessness dating back many centuries 
giving not receiving marks the histories of these minority 
groups 
she cites the american indian tradition of disbursing the 
personal property of a deceased member of the tribe among all his 
survivors 
from that history it was not a great leap to 1977 when dagmar 
thorpe a member of the sac and fox tribe named his foundation the 
seventh generation fund honoring the great law of the iroquois 
people of the longhouse we must consider the impact of our 
decisions on the seventh generation the fund seeks to advance 
the selfsufficiency of north american tribes 
all told the country has more than 30000 foundations with 
assets of over 122 billion in 1988 they gave away 74 billion 
the 5 billion ford foundation is the largest it disbursed 213 
million in 1988 
foundations must file forms with the irs but these require no 
ethnic identification so fixing the exact number of 
minoritycreated foundations is difficult 
ms lynn estimates that there may be 500 or more family 
foundations established by minorities some like those founded by 
entertainers bill cosby and oprah winfrey are wellfunded and well 
known others are virtually unknown 
robert lee a california educator thought he had located all 
the chineseamerican foundations when he reported to a 1989 
conference on minority foundations that he had found 14 of them 
lee kept searching and this year he published a list of 140 
the most famous of them is the milton shoong foundation which 
has 65 million in assets and gives away half a million a year to 
such causes as boys town of italy two buddhist temples three 
christian churches the alameda county calif sheriffs air 
squadron and the special olympics it was founded in the 1930s by 
milton shoongs father joe an immigrant who opened a dry goods 
store in vallejo calif in 1903 that grew into a western chain of 
national dollar stores 
some minority foundations have assets of as little as 25000 
what makes a charity a foundation is the way it is set up with a 
pool of money that is invested the earnings given away but the 
endowment remaining and generating more income for the founder 
there are substantial tax benefits 
having a foundation removes a lot of pressure said ms 
lynn it allows people to feel that they can give to charity in a 
methodical logical way without being inundated by requests 
charitable solicitors are told to submit a written request four 
times a year or so a foundations board of directors often 
family members can review requests and parcel out funds in an 
orderly way by channeling funds into selected directions donors 
can feel their giftgiving is having real impact 
if establishing a foundation still seems too bold families can 
take a lesser step establishing a fund within a community 
foundation such as those that exist in many american cities the 
fund essentially a foundation within a foundation will carry 
their name and fulfill their purposes 
each foundation sets its own rules but often a few thousand 
dollars sometimes paid in annual installments is enough to create 
a family fund 
in texas for example with an initial 2000 mary carmen and 
alfredo saucedo of el paso she was an assistant school principal 
he runs a hardware business created a saucedo fund as part of the 
el paso community foundation now about 20 other hispanic families 
in el paso have followed suit 
generally hispanic foundations help hispanics and african 
americans foundations steer their dollars to black causes but 
increasingly minority foundations are making gifts across racial 
and ethnic lines 
the council noting that white people will constitute a minority 
of americans sometime in the 21st century welcomes that trend as 
a sure sign of maturation and increasing diversity

bennett bidwell is one of the last 
of a breed the executives who rose through the ranks of the 
automotive business when carmaking was the king of industry and 
now hes retiring from chrysler corp 
bidwell came of age when the big three didnt worry about 
imports and no one had heard of a catalytic converter 
during 37 years of selling and renting cars bidwell eventually 
took charge of chryslers car and truckmaking operations as 
chairman of chrysler motors along the way he developed a 
reputation as one of the industrys most colorful and outspoken 
and sometimes profane executives 
at the end of the month bidwell 63 bids farewell to the 
industry that has fallen a long way since it was as he says 
king of the world 
he becomes the fourth highlevel executive to leave chrysler 
during the past year the most notable was former vice chairman 
gerald greenwald who quit to lead an unsuccessful effort by three 
unions to buy united airlines 
bidwell leaves a compnay that is under enormous pressure 
earlier this month california billionaire kirk kerkorian disclosed 
that he bought 98 percent of chryslers stock triggering a 
toughening of the corporations poison pill antitakeover defense 
even though some analysts think chrysler will lose money in 1990 
as some of its top vehicles suffer slipping sales bidwell said he 
sees chrysler moving purposefully into the 21st century 
but peering over his glasses and leaning slightly forward he 
said it may not emerge as the same chrysler that was rescued from 
near bankruptcy in the early 1980s 
at some point in time i believe that chrysler will strengthen 
its international alliances with somebody as part of the 
competition for the growth thats going to occur in markets outside 
of north america he said 
bidwell with his matteroffact tone and nononsense attitude 
apparently has been a good fit with chrysler chairman lee iacocca 
also known to speak his mind 
iacocca brought bidwell to chrysler in june 1983 as executive 
vice president for sales marketing and public affairs for the two 
years before that bidwell had been president and chief operating 
officer of the hertz corp 
it was a job he didnt particularly like 
i tell you what was really boring bidwell said that was 
trying to rent cars rather than sell them it was a good rental 
company a leadership company and all that 
but there was no pizazz he said so he went back into the 
business of making and selling cars 
bidwells introduction to the automotive industry came in 1953 
when he moved from a natural gas company to ford motor cos 
district sales office in boston it was a big cultural change one 
he said he doesnt regret 
when youre an economist with a natural gas company its kind 
of hard to strike up a conversation he said 
conversation is something bidwell never has shunned his direct 
manner is appreciated by some criticized by others lately hes 
had a particular passion for confronting the press 
after lambasting the media for 11 pages in a speech last 
january bidwell in true characteristic form asked rhetorically 
are we dealing with congenital sickos here or is it true that 
good news just wont sell papers 
journalists had tshirts made up commemorating the remark and 
sent a couple to bidwell again in true bidwell form he showed up 
about a month later at an iacocca news conference on 1989 
earnings wearing the tshirt 
but bidwell isnt all bluster he rose through fords marketing 
operations until 1968 when he was named a vice president for ford 
motor credit co 
he later served as general manager for fords lincoln mercury 
division its ford division sales vice president and vice 
president of fords north american car and truck group 
after the hertz hiatus bidwell returned to selling cars when 
iacocca convinced him to come to chrysler he rose to become 
chairman of chrysler motors on nov 10 1988 
bidwell who plans to keep in touch with chrysler but will not 
sit on its board after he retires will be doing some 
nonautomotive consulting work with a new york company he wouldnt 
identify 
and hell be playing some golf one of his passions 
the game plan is to be about 55 percent active he said

near the eve of terry andersons sixth silent 
christmas in captivity his lot and that of five other americans 
held hostage in lebanon is shrouded still with no message of 
holiday hope for freedom 
the latest word from the administration is as so often before 
that there is no new information on prospects for their release 
and that the government is doing everything it can to get them out 
that is a familiar message and a jarring one to the families of 
the lebanon hostages who have just seen hundreds of american 
hostages freed on orders of saddam hussein and flown home from iraq 
and kuwait 
today thanks to president bushs firm policy the nightmare 
has ended for saddams american hostages vice president dan 
quayle said of their release 
the families of the lebanon hostages say the government has not 
done enough to end their nightmare peggy say andersons sister 
said she has begged the government for action she said the iraqi 
release shows what can be accomplished with the full attention of 
national leadership thomas cicippio of norristown pa whose 
brother joseph has been held since 1987 said the hostages must 
pray for bushs help 
but as the administration points out a government even an 
enemy government like iraqs is a structure against which policy 
or pressure can be applied and there is none in the case of the 
hostages in lebanon while their captors all are linked with the 
proiranian group called hezbollah or party of god they are held 
by different factions the one clear demand made for the release of 
anderson and thomas sutherland who also was kidnapped in 1985 was 
for the release of 15 shiite moslems imprisoned as terrorists by 
kuwait that was made moot when iraq invaded kuwait the prisoners 
who were held there are believed to have been sent to iran and two 
who are lebanese reportedly have returned to their homeland 
other shiite groups have linked the hostages fate to other 
grievances including prisoners held in southern lebanon by forces 
aligned with israel and the imprisonment of one of their clerics 
sheik abdul karim obeid israeli forces seized him in a lebanese 
village in july 1989 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press is the longest held of the 13 western hostages in lebanon 
he was kidnapped on march 16 1985 by a group called islamic 
jihad the last direct message from anderson was in a videotape 
released by his captors in october 1988 other hostages freed since 
that time have told of seeing him in captivity 
two american hostages robert polhill and frank reid were 
released by their lebanese captors in april 
when the plight of the hostages still held in lebanon was raised 
as the administration welcomed the release of americans from iraq 
secretary of defense dick cheney said that while there was no 
lessening of concern their situation has been murky from the 
outset 
we havent had the kind of central focus in terms of our 
ability to be able to deal with a specific government as weve had 
in the case of iraq where you clearly have an identifiable 
individual identifiable government that was pursuing that 
policy cheney said 
he said he had nothing new to offer on their prospects for 
freedom i know they weigh heavily on the presidents mind and 
we continue to do everything we can to pursue their release 
cheney said 
the white house said bush raised the question of the lebanon 
hostages when he met with syrian president hafez assad in geneva on 
nov 23 asking for help in gaining their release that was only a 
footnote to a threehour conference at which bush sought to 
strengthen arab support for his effort to force iraqi withdrawal 
from kuwait in the confrontation that threatens war this winter 
syria has about 40000 troops in lebanon under an arab league 
mandate and has tightened its grip as the major power broker 
there the syrian government has said repeatedly that it wants all 
western hostages freed but the captors are aligned with iran the 
hostages are believed to have been taken from beirut to eastern 
lebanon 
their captivity is overshadowed by the confrontation in the 
persian gulf and let us also add a prayer for those americans 
for many years held hostage against their will in the middle 
east bush said as he lit the national christmas tree 
 
editors note walter r mears vice president and columnist 
for the associated press has reported on washington and national 
politics for more than 25 years

jeff cederholm gazes at the mess of newly 
placed logs and branches in rainswollen porter creek the way an 
artist might study his work 
the state fisheries scientist sees the promise of new life in 
the placid pools and riffles where only rapids roared until workers 
placed the debris in the stream this fall 
years of streamside logging instream wood salvaging and 
clearing have cost porter creek nearly all its woody debris which 
is vital to healthy fish habitat cederholm says the story was 
repeated hundreds of times in streams throughout the northwest 
before recent regulations to protect instream wood and streamside 
timber and through them the summer rearing and feeding and winter 
refuge of young fish not ready for migration to sea 
the importance of wood in streams is wellestablished now and 
theres been a lot of work in the northwest to return large organic 
debris to streams but theres been very little thorough evaluation 
of the good or bad that can happen as a result of wood placement 
thats what we want to find out here says cederholm the 
department of natural resources lone fisheries scientist 
i really want to know the answer to this question i get the 
question all the time how come we cant dump logs in the 
creek cederholm says my basic answer is that i want to 
enhance streams as much as anybody the streams are devoid of wood 
from past practices but im not going to jump until i know for 
sure what im doing and what works and what doesnt work 
cederholm pointed through dripping alders at a naked stretch of 
the stream about 25 miles west of olympia some people think 
that looks nice but streams need to be messy to be productive 
habitat for the coho salmon steelhead and cutthroat they need to 
have lots of logs and sidechannel pools a riffle here little 
slow areas there another pool here a big jam down there 
cederholm a big exuberant man with a contagious love of fish 
has joined with weyerhaeuser co fish scientist bob bilby to 
conduct a 400000 scientific experiment along a 1500 meter 
stretch of the creek the findings could lead to restoration of 
woody debris in scores of northwest streams 
the experiment began in 1988 with annual inventories of fish 
populations and computer mapping of stream shape flow and other 
features 
the top 500 meters of the stretch were left as found for 
comparison the next 500 meters were studied by hydrologists and 
about 70 highquality trees were brought from an adjacent hillside 
and placed in the stream the final third dubbed loggers 
choice contains 50 alder trees simply felled into the stream 
the scientists cabled all logs to stumps or boulders to ensure 
against downstream jams and flooding 
a goal is to develop wood placement standards to improve habitat 
at the lowest cost that way cederholm says loggers could perform 
the work themselves while they have equipment and workers on site 
cederholm says the experiment is focusing primarily on the value 
of the debris as winter habitat for the three anadromous species 
fish that migrate from fresh water to the ocean and back 
cederholm and bilby will conduct annual population counts of 
smolting cutthroat steelhead and coho salmon before they go to 
sea they hope to learn within three years if the newly created 
pools protected more of the anadromous fish from being flushed out 
by winter storms and if the pools and riffles improved summer 
feeding habitat 
another major issue is the woods potential value to summer 
cutthroat which prefer deep woodchoked pools for feeding 
the valley through which the creek flows was logged by the 
railroad in the 1930s and streamside douglas fir and cedar were 
taken meaning the streams future wood supply was lost the 
scientist says that was followed by cedar salvagers who cleared 
the creek of other wood in order to float the valuable bolts 
downstream cederholm says 
cederholm pauses along the bank to stare at another jungle of 
logs and branches beautiful he says i just love a messy 
stream

scientists aboard 
this research vessel are bouncing loud noises off the ocean floor 
and recording the echoes in a search for clues to changes in the 
level of the worlds seas 
every six seconds a halfdozen air guns fire into the water 
sending a deep thud penetrating up to 20 kilometers into the 
ocean floor and bouncing back to the ships electronic ears 
we set off an explosion at the surface and we simply listen 
for the echoes said greg mountain a columbia university 
researcher 
this is the first step in a project designed to determine 
whether the oceans are rising rapidly eventually to swamp the 
worlds coastal cities or merely fluctuating as they have for 
millions of years 
scientists believe sea levels changed gradually for most of the 
last 80 million years said ken miller a rutgers university 
researcher old maps of the ocean floor made for oil exploration 
indicate measurable shifts about once every million years 
but in the last 18000 years sea levels have risen worldwide by 
an average 360 feet much valuable beach space has been lost in the 
last few decades 
sea level is rising right now miller said as the 
greenhouse effect kicks in from manmade fossil fuels sea level 
will continue to rise we need to understand the rates of change 
greenhouse effect refers to the theory that pollution in the 
atmosphere is causing the planet to grow warmer 
miller believes large polar ice sheets began melting 40 million 
years ago a process that appears to have been accelerated by mans 
burning of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution in the 18th 
century 
to determine how quickly sea level is changing scientists plan 
to drill holes into the ocean floor and examine buried layers of 
soil from the past 40 million years 
the researchers on the 239foot maurice ewing spent most of 
november gathering information for maps to help them decide where 
to drill theyre looking for layers of sediment that contain clues 
to climate changes 
dating these surfaces tells all about the rise and fall our 
purpose here is to create a data set that will allow us to come 
back in a few years and drill said mountain researchers 
anticipate drilling to begin in 1993 or 1994 after the maps and the 
data on some 700 reels of tape each 3600 feet long are analyzed 
and cataloged 
mountain said researchers are looking for patterns that indicate 
the presence of ancient and now buried shorelines sandy layers 
tend to indicate areas that were close to shore while muddy layers 
tend to signify offshore areas 
the ship supplied by columbia university had a crew of seven 
scientists and nine technical support staff for this project they 
began their mapping about 80 miles east of island beach state park 
and finished in delaware bay 
crew members monitor the rows of computer screens inside and 
maintain the air guns outside around the clock 
when the air guns fire the echo is picked up along a 15 
kilometerlong series of hydrophones underwater recording devices 
encased in an oilfilled hose stretching out behind the vessel the 
instruments distinguish 120 channels or bands of sound frequency 
which are recorded on paper in black lines that look like an 
elongated fingerprint 
the ship also uses water guns to send a higherfrequency noise

the tourist may be the unlikely last hope in the 
preservation of the endangered bengal tiger rwanda mountain 
gorilla and the amazon rain forest 
the only person who is interested in preservation of the 
wildlife and the national parks is the quality visitor said 
kailash sankhala president and founder of tiger trust of india 
hes the only friend the national park has left 
sankhala joined nearly 400 people from 28 countries in miami 
recently for the second annual international symposium on 
ecotourism 
many of the tour operators developers government officials and 
environmentalists there pointed to the tiger trust as a perfect 
example of how tourists developers and preservationists can 
peacefully coexist 
this is really a gettogether of people whose living depends 
on natural resources said jon kusler cochairman of the 
symposium held by the sierra club and the money being brought 
in through tourism is a very powerful resource for protection 
sankhala was a government forester for 35 years before becoming 
interested in saving the tiger in india in 1972 there were only 
1827 tigers left today there are 4300 tigers on 18 reserves in 
india paid for in great part with tourist dollars 
richard ryel founder of international expeditions inc was 
tired of lab research as a biologist and obsessed with butterfly 
collecting in the amazon rain forest 
eleven years ago he organized a few tours to the amazon that 
stressed local culture and custom today he is the largest 
environmentally sensitive tour operator in the world according 
to kusler offering 30 destinations costing 1500 to 5000 
theyre not the average trip ryel said we try to 
establish a greater awareness of a culture and its people to 
preserve it for the future and we offer the local inhabitants a 
reason to save their natural resources for the long term instead 
of destroying it for the shortterm benefit 
he said his tourists want to be educated and feel as if they are 
contributing to the preservation of the people and places they 
visit 
they come home as if theyve had a religious experience 
ryel said 
bill weber said thats how his visitors feel when they climb the 
virunga mountains in rwanda central africa to see the sociable 
gorillas made famous by dian fossey 
weber assistant director of conservation for the wildlife 
conservation international a division of the new york zoological 
society said environmentalists persuaded the rwanda government to 
abandon plans to reduce the size of the volcano national park for 
cattle grazing they told the government it could make more money 
by taking guided hiking tours into the park to see the gorillas 
weber said 5000 to 6000 visitors climb the mountains each 
year paying 200 each to see the gorillas the population was down 
to about 275 in the early 1970s today there are 400 to 450 
gorillas 
closer to home stanley selengut is a naturalist and resort 
developer who has won acclaim for his maho bay campground on st 
john in the united states virgin islands 
he believes developers and conservationists have no choice but 
to learn to live together 
it always seems the most fragile and precious lands are where 
the oceans meet the land said selengut it used to be you 
could damage one place and move on to another but our global 
concerns dont allow that anymore 
his maho bay guests stay in tentcottages share communal 
restrooms recycle what they dont use and are invited to workshops 
and wildlife tours 
ecotourism really is cheaper selengut said because you 
dont promote excess

it can be hard enough for an asthmatic to walk 
in cold dry air without gasping or wheezing and it can be 
tougher still to exercise but doctors say asthmatics can stay 
active outdoors in winter if they take precautions 
the trick is to control the allergic reaction in the airway that 
sets off the attack said michael a kaliner chief of allergic 
diseases at the national institute of allergies and infectious 
diseases in bethesda md 
although experts dont know exactly how the reaction works they 
know that exercise and cold dry air are separate causes 
if you exercise outside in warm weather you can have trouble 
and if you dont exercise in cold weather you can still have 
trouble said dr henry j fishman an asthma specialist in 
washington and an assistant clinical professor at georgetown 
university hospital and george washington university medical 
center 
combining both problems just makes things tougher said fishman 
jogging in the cold is one of the hardest things an asthmatic can 
do 
exercise in some ways takes care of itself an asthma attack 
generally wont take place during exercise but will instead wait 
until three to five minutes after the workout ends said kaliner 
its usually not denial its usually people who are very 
committed to health and want to exercise fishman said however 
some victims may not realize they have asthma and may consider 
their breathing difficulty to be simply part of their usual pattern 
after exercise he said 
asthmatic exercisers may however benefit from a phenomenon 
known as the refractory period that can make the next workout 
easier said dr oded baror an asthma researcher at mcmaster 
university in ontario 
when you exercise and rest the second time you do not have 
an attack he said the period in which you are at least 
partially protected is the refractory period 
the period generally is 45 minutes to an hour but the intensity 
varies from individual to individual and its cause is not known 
said baror 
because vigorous exercise makes a person breathe hard 
exercising in the cold can make an asthmatic suck in more cold dry 
air than he would ordinarily said baror to cut down on the 
problem keep the air you breathe as warm and humid as possible he 
said 
for mild exercise such as walking you can simply breathe 
through your nose he said this can let cold dry air mix before 
it can set off an allergic reaction with air that your body has 
already warmed and humidified he said 
for more vigorous exercise baror recommends putting a scarf 
over the mouth and nose the space between the scarf and the face 
holds warm and humid exhaled air to be mixed with colder air he 
said a surgical mask may do the same thing 
medication can also make it easier to exercise in the cold 
kaliner said some preparations can prevent the mast cells in the 
airways from releasing the histamines that trigger the asthma he 
said others keep the airway open even though the histamines are 
released he said 
asthmatics can avoid the problem by working out indoors 
swimming is considered one of the best exercises for asthmatics

deer carcasses hunters bring to state 
check stations are being searched for the ticks that can carry lyme 
disease in a multistate effort to find clues to the spread of the 
disease in the northeast 
we examine the face ears and down one side of the neck of the 
deer said john edman an entomology professor at the university 
of massachusetts 
ticks have been found consistently on deer shot near the 
connecticut border he said but this fall for the first time 
they have been found on significant numbers of deer shot in the 
central part of the connecticut valley to the north he said 
its an epidemic that has crept up on us said durland fish 
of the medical entomology lab at new york medical college and it 
is crucial that we know where the ticks are found you cant get 
the disease unless you are bitten by a tick 
nationwide there were about 14000 cases of lyme disease 
reported last year the bacterial infection can cause an 
arthritislike inflammation of the joints and damage to the nervous 
system if not treated 
usually the first sign is a red circular rash around the tick 
bite often accompanied by fever fatigue and other flulike 
symptoms

homeowner john scott feels about 400 a month richer these days 
thanks to a recent drop in interest rates and the likelihood of 
further declines following the federal reserves move to ease 
credit 
the 41yearold real estate broker said he recently refinanced 
the mortgage on his fourbedroom contemporary replacing a 12 
percent fixed rate with an 8 percent adjustable rate and lowering 
monthly expenses to 1400 from 1800 
ill probably refinance again some time in the next two years 
because i think rates will continue to drop said scott of 
hilton head sc 
that scenario though troubles people like judy schub a 
lobbyist for the american association of retired persons for the 
elderly person who depends on income from savings as interest 
rates decline their incomes decline she said 
nonetheless many economists say interest rates could ease 
through early next year as the fed attempts to make credit more 
available to help inject new life into the nations sagging 
economy it gave a clear signal on tuesday when it cut its 
discount rate to 6 percent from 7 percent and on wednesday when 
it injected more funds into the banking system thereby pushing 
down the federal funds rate 
the discount rate is the feds fee on loans to member banks 
while the fed fund rate is what banks charge each other in 
overnight lending 
although neither rate directly effects consumer borrowing some 
experts predict banks lower borrowing costs could trickle down to 
average americans and businesses 
the reduction in interest rates will change the attitude of 
consumers and make them feel more positive said donald w 
grigley a senior vice president for connecticut national bank 
where demand for certain loans such as auto and personal loans 
has dropped off recently 
yet lenders like grigley and other businessmen arent so sure 
that lower rates will necessarily motivate consumers to go on a 
buying spree any time soon 
theres enough uncertainty about the economy and the middle 
east crisis to cause people to sit back said willard gourley 
vice chairman of barclaysamericanmortgage corp in charlotte nc 
some people also are predicting rates will go lower theyre 
trying to find a bottom so they dont want to jump in at the 
moment 
for those who have such as scott the hilton head real estate 
broker lower rates have made family finances more bearable 
especially in light of recently rising inflation scott who 
refinanced about 1 months ago said he obtained his original 
mortgage about 18 months ago at a time when rates happened to shoot 
up 
mortgage rates have remained fairly stable throughout most of 
1990 staying in the 10 to 105 percent range for fixedrate 
conventional loans in recent weeks theyve fallen well into 
singledigit territory 
according to hsh associates a butler njbased mortgage 
research firm rates on 30year mortgages averged 9 percent last 
week a threeyear low the company said some rates had fallen even 
as low as 8 percent 
angelo mozilo president of countrywide funding corp in 
pasadena calif one of the nations largest mortgage lending 
companies says the downward tend could prompt more people to 
refinance their home mortgages that would include homeowners with 
adjustable rate mortages that might want to lock in a low fixed 
rate as well as those with high fixed rates mozilo said 
he said he already has seen that happen he said loans for 
refinancing at his firm today make up about 30 percent of business 
up from nearly zero at the start of this year 
while mortgage rates have fallen in recent weeks not all 
consumer loans have followed suit and they may not based on past 
history said robert k heady publisher of bank rate monitor in 
north palm beach fla 
he said that auto loans are actually higher averaging 1226 
percent in december vs 1223 percent in november and 1211 
percent at the start of the year personal loans are also up 
rising to 1734 percent on average from 1730 percent in november 
and 1719 percent in january heady said 
but at the same time he said savings rates on things like 
certificates of deposits have fallen average rates on sixmonth 
cds for instance dropped to 748 percent in december from 757 
percent the previous month and 789 percent in januaury 
the consumer is getting shafted said heady theres no 
doubt about it hes earning less on his savings but hes 
forking out more to make personal loans 
heady and schub the aarp lobbyist say that elderly americans 
are one sector of the population likely to feel the effects of this 
type of discrepancy 
few are in the market for new homes so they wont be taking 
advantage of the lower mortgage rates but many will continue 
buying on credit they say 
whats worse a significant number lives on a fixed income and 
depend on the interest on cds or bonds

with a population of about 170000 
syracuse is considered a typical american city so it should come 
as no surprise that retailers here are having a typical 
recessionyear christmas 
some storeowners are reporting bangup business while others say 
sales are down some retailers are taking a chance by setting up 
shop just as consumers are cutting back 
the retail business in syracuse is much like that of many other 
american cities 
parts of the downtown once a shopping hub resemble a ghost 
town because consumers have taken most of their business to 
suburban malls on salina street a former sibleys department 
store sits empty the atrium a new office building is advertising 
space 
downtown shops were having a slow season going into the last 10 
days of the season a crucial time for all retailers across the 
nation 
at a paul harris store part of a chain of clothing stores 
business has been ok but not as good as last year said store 
manager stefanie kahn 
sales were picking up as christmas approached but it was taking 
longer than usual to sell some merchandise she said prices were 
marked down but the reductions were part of a companywide sale 
down the street bud elliott manager of alberts jewelry store 
said business has been down a little bit but not all that bad 
i cant be alarmed too much said elliott noting that 
alberts in business for 47 years has a cadre of regular 
customers 
i think it is going to be all right he said 
department stores in syracuse like many department stores 
elsewhere were hurting going into the final days of the season 
so the retailers cut prices to lure customers 
at addis amp deys signs advertised 20 percent or 25 percent off 
many items even christmas merchandise and womens and childrens 
party clothing once exempt from preholiday markdowns were on 
sale 
the strategy worked salespeople reported the downtown store 
which had been quiet in the days after thanksgiving was mobbed at 
lunchtime once the sale began 
some syracuse retailers have escaped the recession one is 
ralin which sells appliances housewares sporting goods luggage 
and jewelry in a small crowded building in a commercial area but 
off the beaten track 
ralin has been busy this past friday for example a security 
guard directed traffic outside while inside customers were taking 
three and four small appliances apiece to the cash register 
rich robin merchandise manager in the home appliance section 
said the store had a slight lull after the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait but business picked up soon afterward 
the major appliance department has hired extra sales help said 
president jerry heller 
heller said the secret of ralins success is longevity the 
store has been in business for 40 years and has sold major 
appliances for 15 and its low prices he invited customers to 
compare his prices with those of competitors whose newspaper ads 
he posted on a wall 
it has also been a good christmas at carousel center a 15 
million squarefoot mall that rests like a palace of light and 
glass near lake onondaga 
pyramid cos which built the mall tried to make it different 
from the standard malls in suburban syracuse so it brought in 
acres of italian marble for the floors and miles of decorative 
brass stripping an 80yearold refurbished carousel sits inside 
the center 
but perhaps more significantly pyramid sought out stores that 
have never been in syracuse including such upscale names as 
williamssonoma and lord amp taylor one of pyramids own bonwit 
teller stores is at the mall 
carousel center sounds like a big gamble in these recessionary 
times 
but bruce keenan a partner in the real estate developer was 
confident that syracuse although largely a middleamerican city 
can support a tonier mall 
for one thing pyramid placed a similar mall in buffalo ny a 
working class city several years ago and it has been thriving 
keenan said 
carousel center is the first mall inside the city limits but 
its appeal extends beyond syracuse and its immediate suburbs 
keenan said the mall has been drawing customers willing to travel 
30 miles or more 
but what happens after the novelty has faded 
keenan was not worried stores that have leased space in 
carousel center are doing longterm planning rather than 
shortterm he said 
by the time christmas is over pyramid expects the mall which 
opened oct 15 to have drawn 3 million shoppers this past 
weekend the mall was very busy even late at night but so were 
the malls in syracuse suburbs

britains retailers are facing the worst christmas 
selling season in 10 years as an economic downturn and 14 percent 
interest rates cause britons to pinch their pence 
the slump worsened by unusually cold weather is driving an 
unprecedented number of shops to open illegally on sundays 
inciting debate about britains trading laws and prompting prime 
minister john major to call for reform 
even the big chains have joined hundreds perhaps thousands of 
independent shops as outlaws and more shopkeepers might be 
panicked into opening up this coming sunday 
the lawbreakers who risk fines of up to 1000 pounds about 
1930 and court injunctions shutting them down say they are 
meeting customer demand 
the main shop workers union usdaw and the keep sunday special 
pressure group say they are ruining sundays and preventing 
employees from spending the day with families they also accuse the 
outlaw retailers of stealing sales and jobs from midweek business 
and from the lawabiding majority 
major told the house of commons tuesday that the two sides 
should reach an agreement that could be the basis for reform 
he described the 1950s shops act which bars english and welsh 
stores from opening on sundays as bizarre he noted that scottish 
shops are allowed to trade on sundays 
like storeowners in the recessiontainted united states many 
merchants also are slashing prices before the traditional january 
sales period because theyre finding it the only way they can 
generate business 
at the same time retailers have reported a pickup in sales in 
recent days and are hoping for a lastminute surge 
december retail sales are expected to fall from a year ago the 
first decline since britains 198081 recession said roy 
maconochie an analyst with the london investment firm james capel 
and co 
the combination of heavy markdowns and belowtarget sales 
coinciding with rising costs do not bode well for profits 
maconochie said 
he recently downgraded his profit forecasts for many of 
britains top retailing companies whose shares then took a 
battering on londons stock exchange 
the economic slowdown and high interest rates mean more britons 
are losing jobs and struggling to pay their adjustable rate 
mortgage payments inflation running at 97 percent doesnt help 
consumer confidence is at a low at the moment generally 
said james may directorgeneral of the retail consortium a trade 
group which says it represents 90 percent of the british retail 
industry 
an unusual snowstorm on the weekend of dec 7 and continuing 
bitterly cold weather also has hurt sales the experts said 
among the stores that have stayed open sunday is hamleys 
britains biggest and oldest toy store management said the move 
was justified by the 30000 people who passed through the doors of 
the regent street shop that day 
the store was undeterred by an 800pound 1544 fine imposed 
last week for trading on sunday in october 1989 it said it might 
open again this sunday 
being not the best of economic years were running a little 
high on our inventory said chief executive duncan chadwick it 
gives us an opportunity to liquidate that

the departing leader of the new york stock 
exchange said wednesday he expects the downturn in the nations 
financial markets to last another six to 18 months 
but john j phelan jr who steps down dec 31 after six years 
as nyse chairman called the threeyear industry slump just another 
business cycle and predicted the markets would be roaring again 
by the mid1990s 
in an interview in his wall street office phelan also said the 
big board was on course for a plan to institute limited afterhours 
trading for the first time in its 198yearhistory 
he further said the oftendiscussed possibility of a merger with 
the smaller american stock exchange likely will be raised again in 
the future 
phelan 59 said he will serve on several corporate boards head 
an executive education group and continue as chairman of an 
international stock exchange association a birder phelan also 
said he plans to raise money for the audubon society 
william h donaldson a wall street veteran and cofounder of 
the brokerage donaldson lufkin amp jenrette inc takes over for 
phelan during a bear market that shows little signs of quickly 
reversing 
weve got problems to get over phelan said we had 
excesses in the 80s the entire country overleveraged itself from 
each individual right up through the majority of corporations its 
going to take us awhile to digest that 
but i think we will do that without a major catastrophe 
he said i think by the middle of this decade youre going to 
have a roaring market again well all be worried about capacity 
and volume again 
after hitting an alltime high of 299975 in july the dow 
jones industrial average tumbled 21 percent by october before 
regaining some lost ground in the last two months 
average daily trading volume for 1990 through november was 1569 
million shares nyse figures show a 58 percent drop from last 
year and 169 percent lower than 1987 
those declines coupled with a deepening recession on wall 
street reflected by thousands of layoffs and acrosstheboard 
business declines at major investment firms are expected to be 
exaggerated by the nations economic woes 
asked when the market might turn around phelan said six to 18 
months 
phelan leaves behind a legacy as a candid and forceful leader of 
the nations no 1 stock exchange he is best known for safely 
guiding the nyse through the 508point stock market crash in 
october 1987 
phelan also presided over the greatest expansion and 
technological explosion in nyse history despite the recent 
selloff volume today is 72 percent higher than in 1984 and more 
than eight times higher than when he arrived as a vice chairman in 
1975 
phelans major piece of unfinished business is a fivepart plan 
for continuous roundtheclock trading announced earlier this year 
the first step in the plan is for limited trading sessions 
shortly after the market close now expected to begin in january 
phelan said the proposal is awaiting approval by the securities and 
exchange commission 
phelan said the initial sessions would go on despite the recent 
low volume as a prelude toward more extensive trading but phelan 
said fullscale 24hour trading is a long way off 
he was skeptical of this whole theory of a couch potato 
sitting there at 2 oclock in the morning dying to make a trade in 
something most people dont like to trade when the home market is 
closed its going to take a long time to change that 
but he added i think theres a good chance somewhere out 
there that in certain securities there may be a continuing demand 
and we ought to have something out there in case the demand 
comes 
on other matters phelan said restrictions on computerized 
program trading instituted this year had helped prevent volatile 
movements in the market blamed for heightening investor anxiety 
now he said everybodys invited to the party but nobodys 
allowed to get drunk and disorderly 
clearly the investing public whether its the institutions or 
the individual plus everybody who regulates the market felt 
more comfortable when there was no volatility he said 
phelan also said one of the nyses biggest weaknesses has been 
its inability to market socalled derivative products such as stock 
and bond options 
he said the strength of the rival american stock exchange may 
lead to a renewal of talks about a merger i think it is 
something that will come up again he said

citicorps severe restructuring is one of the 
most vivid demonstrations yet of how oncemighty us banks have 
faltered in a weakening economy 
predictions are at least as grim for 1991 leading to 
expectations of more bloodletting 
analysts generally applauded plan by the nations largest 
banking company announced tuesday to cut its dividend by 44 
percent lay off 8000 workers and set aside 340 million for 
commercial loan losses 
but the amount of money set aside for problem loans was a lot 
less than what many people on street were looking for said 
richard goleniewski banking analyst for goldman sachs and co 
analysts estimates of the banks problem loans range as high as 
2 billion 
raphael soifer banking analyst for brown brothers harriman amp 
co said he assumes citicorps loan loss reserves are adequate for 
now because the bank just underwent a government examination 
results of the us comptroller of the currency probe werent 
released because of confidentiality rules 
but it does raise a question about the future deterioration of 
the real estate portfolio soifer said 
fay wong a vicepresident at fitch investors service predicted 
a bumpy year for citicorp as it further pads its problem loan 
account 
citicorp is not alone with problem loans about 30 percent of 
bank lending involves real estate and the number of problem loans 
is expected to rise sharply as property values drop and building 
vacancies increase 
citicorps real estate problems are especially thorny because 
the banks portfolio has large holdings in the northeast among the 
hardesthit areas in a recession now enveloping much of the 
country 
the bank has 132 billion loans outstanding according to 
reports making it that largest commercial real estate lender in 
the country 
further many large banks played a significant role in the 
leveraged buyout trend in the 1980s which saddled many companies 
with risky debt by some industry reckonings highly leveraged 
loans account for 10 percent of the loan portfolio for the nations 
seven largest banks 
like others brown brothers analyst soifer predicts citicorp 
will set aside more cash to cover bank loans in the next year 
its hard to say how much because we dont know how bad the 
economy will get here he said 
the proposed dividend cut to be presented to citicorps 
directors next month surprised some in the banking community 
chairman john reed stated recently a cut in dividends is an 
inefficient way to raise capital 
they dont have a lot of choice here said goleniewski of 
goldman sachs 
banks have limited access to capital markets because theyre 
greatly restricted in securities trading selling assets such as 
real estate holdings and subsidiary businesses are among the key 
alternatives to raising cash 
reeds action boosted investor confidence said ms wong of 
fitch investors the credit rating agency reaffirmed citicorps 
senior debt rating at aaminus late tuesday 
ms wong said citicorps restructuring showed managers had the 
will to make painful adjustments in the face of bad financial 
news 
its an event that the analyst community has been 
anticipating i think there is relief that citicorp has come out 
with it prior to the fourth quarter announcement ms wong said 
but a dividend cut places citicorp in a very difficult position 
said soifer such a cut gives citicorp just 260 million hardly 
enough to cover the amount of its problem loans believed to be at 
least 2 billion he also said a cut in dividends might complicate 
future attempts to raise cash through the stock market 
the banking company said it would sell some assets to raise 
cash but did not elaborate few analysts are willing to speculate 
what might be sold 
such a sale is in line with economists expectations of an 
overall consolidation in the industry bank of new england already 
has sold nearly 4 billion in assets in the face of the slumping 
economy 
timing of any sales will be crucial because of plummeting land 
values nationwide the resolution trust corporation the agency 
charged with selling off assets of failed savings and loans is 
generally viewed as depressing market prices as it tries to unload 
property

one of the nations largest banks cut its prime 
lending rate by a steep 05 percentage point to 95 percent today 
two days after the federal reserve lowered one if its key lending 
rates in an effort to prevent the recession from deepening 
first national bank of chicago the 13th largest us banking 
company said it would lower its prime rate from 10 percent 
effective immediately 
earlier in the month a handful of regional banks took a more 
cautious step by easing their prime rates to 975 percent but 
analysts said larger institutions were waiting for a cue from the 
fed before following suit 
the recent decline in the prime rate which serves as a guide 
for bank lending charges for a host of business and consumer loans 
marks the first cut in the rate in nearly a year 
it is a longoverdue adjustment said william sullivan 
director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc 
the fact that this is the first major national money center bank 
to go might trigger others to follow soon 
sullivan noted that the 05 percentage point cut was a bit 
steeper than had been expected but he said it indicated that banks 
are finally taking the message that the fed wants rates lower 
on tuesday the fed cut the discount rate the interest it 
charges on loans to member banks to 65 percent from 7 percent 
the first decline in the rate since august 1986 but in addition 
the fed has also been gradually cutting the federal funds rate 
the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans 
the fed funds rate has been eased twice this month alone it was 
trimmed a quarter of a percentage point on dec 7 and since has 
fallen to 7 percent 
todays prime rate cut is clearly in response to the feds 
recent actions which included not only a drop in the funds rate 
but a downward adjustment in the discount rate sullivan said 
james annable first chicagos chief economist said that by 
easing the fed funds rate the nations central bank is telling 
the market that we are taking this recession seriously and once 
that rate moved lower it was time to pass it on to our 
customers 
annable said consumers should see declines next month on loans 
that are tied to the prime rate like home equity lines of credit 
major banks have hesitated to move ahead of the fed because they 
are concerned about their own profit margins 
the last industrywide cut in the prime rate occurred on jan 8 
when the rate when from 105 percent to 10 percent

donald trumps taj mahal casino 
resort has two weeks to submit its financial forecasts through 1995 
as well as supporting documents for its restructuring of 675 
million in bonds 
in an unrelated matter the state casino control commission also 
ruled wednesday against trump plaza hotel and casino in admitting 
potentially damaging evidence in a discrimination case against the 
gambling hall 
the commission said in its ongoing hearings on the financial 
stability of the 8monthold taj mahal that the casino must 
present its monthly forecasts for 1991 and quarterly predictions 
for the years 199295 
the taj mahal must also submit fully executed documents to the 
commission that show how it plans to implement agreements with its 
lenders commission chairman steve perskie said 
trump attorney nicholas ribis said he anticipated the financial 
forecasts and the documents would be ready by dec 28 adding that 
the taj mahal has successfully scrambled throughout this month to 
meet the commissions deadlines 
the tough ones are behind us ribis said 
the commissions hearings are looking at the stability of the 
taj ahal which renegotiated its 675 million in debt one day 
after failing to make a 473 million payment due nov 15 
the casino intends to file a prepackaged bankruptcy under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and leave bankruptcy 
protection by spring the taj mahals restructuring would give 
bondholders half ownership in the taj mahal in exchange for 
accepting a smaller interest rate 12 percent instead of 14 
percent 
perskie said he anticipates conducting the next hearing on the 
taj mahal sometime in january after the commission can study all 
the data the commission has the power to take away a license if it 
finds the casino operator is financially unstable 
the commission also voted unanimously wednesday to allow more 
evidence concerning charges that trump plaza discriminated against 
its black and female employees the charges say robert libuttis 
racist demands prompted the casino to move the employees he has 
denied he is a racist 
libutti a muchcoveted high roller from saddle river who 
wagered as much as 10000 on a roll of the dice allegedly used 
epithets on at least 59 occasions between may 1986 and may 1988 to 
get white male dealers on his craps game 
perskie said administrative law judge lillard law erred in his 
aug 17 ruling by not allowing consideration of evidence gathered 
against the casino after may 1988 
the state division of gaming enforcement an arm of the state 
attorney generals office said the evidence would show trump 
plazas reasons for moving employees were a pretext for its 
discrimination 
if such evidence is relevant in proving whether or not the 
alleged violations occurred it should have been admitted 
perskie said 
the gaming division has proposed fines of between 590000 and 
975000 either of which would be the largest fine in the 12year 
history of legalized gambling here the casino contends the 
division failed to prove one specific instance where the casino 
discriminated against an employee

aetna life amp casualty co has announced 
plans to withdraw from personal insurance in oklahoma washington 
and arkansas because of financial losses and too little business 
the company said wednesday that nearly 27000 policies will be 
dropped 
aetna has cut its number of personal auto policies nationally by 
nearly 16 percent since the end of 1989 from 21 million to 18 
million at the end of november 1990 
aetna spokesman john hawkins said withdrawals from more states 
are likely as the company continues to review its business 
the moves are part of aetnas decision to put capital behind 
business it expects to be profitable over time and to withdraw from 
states or lines of business that do not produce adequate returns on 
investment 
earlier this year aetna announced withdrawal from auto 
insurance in south carolina and from auto and homeowners lines in 
new mexico idaho nevada and arizona 
in addition the insurer is no longer selling new personal auto 
policies in pennsylvania or rhode island and is suing 
massachusetts over rules that make it expensive to withdraw from 
auto insurance there 
aetna has lost money in personal lines in oklahoma washington 
and arkansas hawkins said no figures were available he said 
the company has only a small part of the market in the three 
states in oklahoma for instance where aetna has 4872 auto and 
homeowners policies the company is the 26th largest vendor of 
personal insurance hawkins said 
in arkansas with 3956 auto and homeowners policies in force 
aetna is the 18th largest player in auto insurance and in 
washington aetna is ranked 15th in auto insurance with about 
10000 auto policies the company has 8000 homeowners polices in 
washington 
aetna will stop selling new personal policies in oklahoma on 
friday in washington by the end of the year and in arkansas in 
february hawkins said

the accounting industrys rulemaking board has 
proposed that businesses supply more uptodate financial 
information to investors a move that could prove costly to 
companies battered by a soft economy 
the financial accounting standards board agreed late tuesday to 
propose requiring companies to disclose in footnotes in their 
financial statements the market value of many assets that are now 
merely shown at their original cost 
the new york times said the proposal would apply to nearly all 
categories of financial instruments including stocks bonds 
options and in the case of financial institutions customer 
deposits and loans 
the proposed marketbased accounting rule could prove costly to 
companies suffering in todays softening economy earlier this 
month fasb approved a farreaching change in the way businesses 
report healthcare costs for retired workers a move that has the 
potential to slash millions of dollars from comapnies financial 
earnings 
but the traditional approach scornfully dubbed 
onceuponatime accounting by critics may have little 
relation to actual worth in a slumping economy it has been faulted 
for contributing to the crisis facing financial institutions by 
letting them avoid revising loan portfolios to reflect falling 
values 
the proposal on market values is open to public comment for four 
months before it can be made final

don r dixon one of the first savings and loan 
owners to be accused of fraud in the industrys nationwide debacle 
was convicted today of using depositor money to finance a 
highflying life 
a jury of eight men and four women deliberated two weeks before 
convicting dixon on 23 counts of a 38count indictment that accused 
him of using thousands of dollars from vernon savings association 
to finance extravagances that included california beachhouse 
parties 
dixon 52 owned vernon from 1981 to 1986 when it grew 10fold 
the thrifts failure in 1987 cost taxpayers 13 billion and was 
one of the first costly collapses of the savings and loan crisis 
dixon had been indicted earlier this year for misapplication of 
funds making false statements and other crimes if convicted on 
all charges he could have been sentenced to 190 years in jail and 
fined as much as 95 million 
he watched impassively while the verdict was read and embraced 
his tearful wife after the hearing concluded us district judge 
joe fish set sentencing for feb 19 
testimony lasted more than five weeks with about two dozen 
witnesses including dixon 
some former vernon employees testified dixon directed them to 
reimburse themselves with the thrifts money for political 
contributions others said he ordered them to hire prostitutes for 
parties at a beach house near san diego 
witnesses also said dixon crafted a scheme to divert loan 
advances to pay rent on the house and doctored records to hide 
vernons ownership of the house from thrift regulators 
dixon also tried to curry favor from former texas savings and 
loan department commissioner linton bowman by taking him on trips 
to kansas and california and arranging for women to sleep with him 
witnesses said 
dixon testified that knew of no illegal activity at the thrift 
during the time he owned it he blamed employees for the wrongdoing 
he said he learned about during the trial 
the house at solana beach calif was a hotel and office for 
vernon as it expanded into the southern california real estate 
market he said the parties were a tiny part of 10 million that 
the thrift spent on marketing and public relations while he was 
owner dixon said 
he said that in hindsight hiring women to attend the parties was 
inappropriate but not illegal 
the thrifts asset base grew more than tenfold under dixons 
ownership one year vernon made a 50 million profit but in 1986 
more than 90 percent of vernons loans were not being repaid 
vernons net worth had sunk to a negative 71686 million when 
regulators took it over 
the failure in 1987 helped galvanize the attention of the public 
and lawmakers to the troubles in the savings and loan industry 
regulators found vernon owned 17th century castle doors and 
expensive art objects including a baccarat eagle and a 
silverstudded saddle the thrift also owned a yacht in washington 
used by some members of congress for parties 
seven other vernon officials including former chairman woody 
lemons a consultant and two borrowers have been convicted or 
pleaded guilty to various crimes in connection with the thrift 
lemons in april was sentenced to 30 years in prison for 
misapplication of funds conspiracy and bank fraud it was the 
stiffest penalty handed a figure in the savings and loan crisis 
but prosecutors and investigators for months have painted dixon 
as the main culprit behind the crimes dixon also is the lead 
defendant in a 540 million federal fraud lawsuit filed in 1987

the shortterm outlook for the world economy has 
worsened markedly in recent months the organization of economic 
development and cooperation said in a major report thursday 
the organization of 24 major industrial democracies said in a 
twiceyearly report that the rise in oil prices has boosted 
inflation and curtailed output 
it said eastern european countries face special difficulties as 
they try to convert to market economies and it gave a gloomy 
assessment of the soviet unions economic health 
among the oecds own members the united states was repeatedly 
singled out as a cause of particular economic concern 
differences have become more accentuated between the buoyancy 
of activity in some countries notably japan and western germany 
and its weakness in a number of other countries including the 
united states the report said 
inflation remains under control in western germany and japan 
but is relatively high in the united states the report said it 
noted that the dollars weakness was contributing to inflationary 
pressures in the us economy 
the report said developments in the worlds financial markets 
have been disquieting 
equity prices have plunged and marketdetermined interest 
rates have risen in many countries only in part because of the 
gulf situation it said fragility persists in some sectors of 
us financial markets where banks are limiting credits to certain 
classes of borrowers and questions have risen about banks balance 
sheets in japan 
these developments together with the effects of higher oil 
prices have led to a less favorable view of the shortterm 
economic outlook than before the summer inflation is likely to be 
higher and output weaker 
the oecd projected that economic activity among its members 
could expand by 2 percent in 1991 picking up to 25 percent in 
1992 
it said unemployment would increase from 625 percent of the 
labor force in the first half of 1990 to almost 7 percent in 1992 
consumer price inflation was likely to be 6 percent annually in the 
first half of 1991 but could drop to under 45 percent by late 
1992 
the projections were based on an oil price of 27 per barrel and 
noted that if prices rose further the task of policy in 
containing inflation and supporting confidence would be harder 
the report also said 
government deficits in the united states and germany will be 
greater than expected the oecd estimated that the us deficit 
would be about 250 billion in fiscal 1991 and could increase the 
following year 
the recent us budgetcutting agreement will substantially 
strengthen control over public expenditure the report said 
nonetheless the federal government deficit is likely to remain 
large for several years 
global problems such as rising interest rates and higher oil 
prices will complicate the tasks of eastern european countries as 
they switch to market economies 
although reforms have begun output declined in 1990 in all 
these countries and is likely at best to stabilize in 1991 while 
inflation remains a widespread problem 
in the soviet union specific reform measures have not yet 
been agreed to let alone implemented the report added soviet 
output is falling inflation is accelerating and the trade 
balance could deteriorate 
the oecd said its members could help eastern europe by ensuring 
that their own markets were open 
more liberal trade policies would contribute to a more stable 
as well as more prosperous world the report said 
the member nations of the oecd are australia austria belgium 
britain canada denmark finland france germany greece 
iceland ireland italy japan luxembourg the netherlands new 
zealand norway portugal spain sweden switzerland turkey and 
the united states

the takeover of the troubled public service 
co of new hampshire cleared another regulatory hurdle today as 
federal securities authorities gave their blessing to the 
reorganization plan 
connecticutbased northeast utilities wants to acquire the new 
hampshire utility which is the majority owner of the seabrook 
nuclear power plant 
the securities and exchange commission approved two alternative 
plans for berlin connbased northeast utilities to acquire psnh 
the largest electric utility in new hampshire 
the acquisition is part of psnhs plan to emerge from bankruptcy 
law proceedings it sought court protection from its creditors in 
january 1988 so it could develop a plan of reorganization 
under one plan psnh would be come a whollyowned subsidiary of 
northeast through northeasts acquisition of a new issue of psnh 
common stock the new subsidiary would own and operate all of 
psnhs assets except seabrook which would be owned by another new 
northeast subsidiary called north atlantic 
but that deal would have to be approved by dec 31 to take 
effect 
more likely is a twostep plan in which northeast would provide 
money for psnh to function on its own until the connecticut holding 
company could actually take over psnh and form it into a 
subsidiary 
although the sec approved both plans the deal is still subject 
to approval by federal energy and nuclear power regulators as well 
as several state agencies 
the sec regulates public utility holding companies like 
northeast utilities that maintain interstate facilities there 
are about nine such electrical utilities 
the psnh reorganization is being held up by appeals of the state 
public utilities commissions approval of northeasts 23 billion 
takeover plan 
in addition the new hampshire electric cooperative has filed a 
200 million claim against public service the claim says the coop 
was defrauded in 1981 on cost and schedule projections for the 
seabrook nuclear power plant on which it based its decision to buy 
22 percent of the plant

china rebuked hong kongs leading bank thursday 
for plans to reorganize under a british holding company which has 
been viewed as a sign of eroding confidence in the colony that 
reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
the hongkong and shanghai banking corp which in some ways acts 
like hong kongs central bank because it issues more than half the 
local currency announced the reorganization monday 
the change reflected similar moves taken by hundreds of other 
hong kong companies fearing what may happen to the capitalist 
enclave in the transition to chinese sovereignty 
but the banks move was considered particularly significant 
because it is one of hong kongs most influential businesses 
we believe that as an important financial and commercial 
institution the hongkong and shanghai banking corp should see to 
it that any new measure it takes will help promote rather than 
undermine the stability and prosperity of hong kong foreign 
ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said 
the chinese government has all along worked to maintain the 
stability and prosperity of hong kong for the benefit of hong kong 
residents and the benefit of both china and the united kingdom 
li said 
william purves chairman of the bank said the decision to 
reorganize reflected the banks global reach and did not signal 
abandonment of the territory where it has flourished for 125 years 
under an agreement with britain the chinese have promised to 
preserve hong kongs way of life for at least 50 years beyond 1997 
but faith in that pledge was shaken by the june 1989 military 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in china confidence also 
has eroded because of bickering between china and britain over the 
exact terms of the takeover agreement

grain and soybean futures prices fell thursday on 
the chicago board of trade amid fears that soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadzes resignation could lead to a halt in soviet 
purchases of us grain 
the decline in prices reflected a worstcase scenario in which 
soviet president gorbachev also would quit and the soviet militia 
would be called upon to quell civil unrest said william 
biedermann research director for allendale inc a commodities 
brokerage in crystal lake ill 
traders also feared that if gorbachev were to resign or be 
forced out by conservatives the united states would withdraw a 1 
billion line of food export credit it extended to the soviets last 
week 
a military crackdown would not bode well for future credit 
offers said analyst don roose of us commodities inc in des 
moines iowa 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 260 a bushel corn was

prudentialbache securities inc will report a 
1990 loss of about 250 million more than double what analysts had 
expected and a further sign of the malaise gripping wall street 
its parent said thursday 
the prudential insurance co of america also said it had 
injected 200 million in new capital into the struggling investment 
firm which has abandoned or reduced several key businesses in a 
major restructuring 
the equity infusion is the latest move by a big corporate parent 
this year to contain losses at firms pummeled by a collapse in 
merger activity and the junk bond market 
the securities industry has cut more than 50000 jobs nationwide 
since the 1987 stock market crash this year layoffs have been 
concentrated in highpaying jobs such as investment banking 
the anticipated 250 million loss at prudentialbache exceeds 
analysts forecasts of 75 million to 100 million including 1990 
prudentialbache has been unprofitable in three of the last four 
years the firm lost 51 million in 1989 
prudential an insurance and financial services company in a 
statement attributed the loss at its securities subsidiary to 
drastic cuts in four core areas intended to reduce exposure to 
unprofitable businesses 
prudentialbache in recent months laid off twothirds of its 
investment bankers or 120 professionals closed its risk arbitrage 
trading operation sold its canadian arm and reduced its limited 
partnership activities 
prudentialbache chairman george l ball said in a memo to 
employees that the firm had spent 370 million on costs associated 
with the reductions including severance payments he said the 
lower total loss indicates very healthy core profitability in our 
other activities 
in addition to the 200 million equity infusion the parent 
company said it was acquiring all of prudentialbaches merchant 
banking assets and that the business in the future would be managed 
by the parent 
spokesmen for the companies declined to say how much the 
merchant banking assets totaled the firm said it had a capital 
base of 16 billion and that the infusion was not made to meet 
federal regulatory requirements 
merchant banking is one of the areas hardest hit during the wall 
street slowdown it involves investing a firms own capital into 
merger deals often with risky junk bonds many of those 
transactions have soured because of the markets decline and the 
shaky status of many takeovers 
prudential insurance bought bache group inc in 1984 for 385 
million and has invested more than 1 billion into the securities 
firm which failed in an attempt to become an investment banking 
power and is returning to its retail brokerage roots 
prudential spokesman joe vecchione said the capital injection 
was a sign of support for the investment firm he said the company 
and ball have the full support of the prudential 
were longterm investors vecchione said were willing to 
weather downturns in the business 
prudentialbache which has 17000 employees down from 19000 a 
year ago said it would focus on its individual investor and mutual 
fund activities which made money in 1990 
in his memo to employees ball said the firm would highlight 
the burgeoning financial needs of affluent individual investors 
in the united states and abroad 
as part of its costcutting efforts prudentialbache this week 
confirmed it is negotiating with shearson lehman brothers inc to 
merge data processing operations for securities transactions firms 
expanded those operations in the 1980s but now have excess capacity 
because of a decline in the retail business since 1987 
perrin long an industry analyst with lipper analytical 
securities corp said the 200 million capital injection would 
improve prudentialbaches balance sheet and help broker 
recruitment because it was a sign of stability 
other companies have been forced to help bail out securities 
subsidiaries this year american express co injected more than 1 
billion and took full control of shearson and cs holdings pumped 
more than 700 million into cs first boston inc and assumed the 
bulk of the firms outstanding bridge loans from problematic 
merchant banking deals

acquisition of the bankrupt new hampshire 
utility that controls the seabrook nuclear plant was approved by 
federal stock regulators thursday eliminating one more roadblock 
to the power companys reorganization plan 
northeast utilities wants to acquire public service co of new 
hampshire which holds the largest stake 356 percent in the 
controversial seabrook plant 
the securities and exchange commission approved two methods for 
the acquisition of psnh the largest electrical utility in new 
hampshire by berlin connbased northeast utilities 
the acquisition is the key part of psnhs plan to emerge from 
bankruptcy reorganization which it entered in january 1988 to seek 
protection from creditors 
the citizens of new hampshire will be well benefitted from 
having a wellrun viable economically sound wellmanaged public 
utility company in place of a bankrupt one that cannot plan or look 
forward to future developments said marianne k smythe head of 
the secs division of investment management 
the sec regulates public utility holding companies like 
northeast utilities that maintain interstate facilities there 
are nine such electrical utilities around the country 
in a separate action the sec decided to submit for public 
comment proposed rules changes that would cut some of the red tape 
involved in offering foreign securities for sale in this country 
the sec gave its blessing to two possible ways for northeast 
utilities to acquire psnh 
under the first method psnh would become a wholly owned 
subsidiary of northeast through northeasts acquisition of a new 
issue of psnh common stock that new subsidiary to be called new 
psnh would own and operate all of psnhs assets except seabrook 
which are valued at 162 billion the seabrook assets worth an 
estimated 700 million would be owned by still another new 
northeast subsidiary called north atlantic 
that deal would have to be approved by the federal energy 
regulatory commission the nuclear regulatory commission state 
regulators and the courts by dec 31 
more likely is the second twostep plan in which northeast 
would provide money for psnh to function on its own until the 
connecticut holding company could actually merge psnh into a newly 
created subsidiary to be called northeast utilities acquisition 
corp 
the acquisition of psnh would be financed by cash and various 
new securities including common and preferred stock bonds and 
notes 
while approved by the sec this plan is still subject to 
clearance by federal energy and nuclear power regulators as well as 
several state agencies 
northeast owns connecticut light and power co western 
massachusetts electric co and holyoke water power co 
meanwhile thursday an administrative law judge found the 
proposed psnhnortheast merger would be in the public interest and 
recommended approval by the ferc subject to certain conditions 
the ferc isnt expected to take up the matter until early next 
year however 
the psnh reorganization plan is being held up by an appeal to 
the new hampshire supreme court of a decision by that states 
public utilities commission to approve northeasts 23 billion 
takeover plan another roadblock is a 200 million claim filed 
against public service by the new hampshire electric cooperative 
the claim alleges the coop was defrauded on cost and schedule 
projections for the seabrook plant on which it based its decision 
to buy 22 percent of the plant

the dollar finished broadly higher thursday as 
traders sought a safe haven in the wake of the uncertainties 
created by the resignation of soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
gold prices rose in europe but retreated slightly in us 
trading on the new york commodity exchange gold bullion for 
current delivery settled at 38590 a troy ounce off 10 cents from 
wednesday later republic national bank quoted a late bid for gold 
of 38335 an ounce down 55 cents 
the dollar gained ground in european trading and continued its 
climb when dealings shifted to domestic markets 
though traders were buying dollars much of the days activity 
centered on selling the german mark on the theory that germany is 
more widely exposed to the economic and political climate in the 
soviet union than other nations 
germany has large loans outstanding to the soviet union and 
because of german monetary union there was great expectation that 
they would find a huge export market within the soviet union 
said michael malpede a senior analyst at refco group ltd in 
chicago 
john mccarthy chief dealer at amsterdam rotterdam bank in new 
york characterized trading as a flight out of germany rather 
than a flight to quality he predicted that we will have to see 
more disintegration in the soviet union before there is any real 
permanent effect on dollar trading 
still shevardnadzes resignation was dramatic enough to 
distract attention from the deepening us recession and declining 
interest rates lower interest rates generally are bearish for the 
dollar because they erode the value of fixedincome securities 
the move brings the market focus to the economic fundamentals 
of europe and takes some of the focus off the economic concerns in 
the us malpede said 
trading was active but typically thin ahead of the christmas 
holiday which accentuated the dollars advance 
in tokyo the dollar rose to a closing 13458 japanese yen from 
13327 yen on wednesday later in london it rose further to 13475 
yen in new york the dollar closed at 13585 yen up from 13405 
yen on wednesday 
in london the british pound fell to 19080 from 19316 late 
wednesday in new york it cost 18930 to buy one pound less 
expensive than wednesdays 19310 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
wednesdays rates included 15125 german marks up from 14783 
12995 swiss francs up from 12675 51425 french francs up from

lawyers for convicted junk bond financier 
michael milken have notified a federal court they intend to appeal 
his 10year prison sentence 
the legal notice of appeal was filed wednesday in federal court 
in manhattan it does not state the basis for an appeal to the 2nd 
us circuit court of appeals which must be made later 
milken 44 was sentenced last month by us district judge 
kimba wood for his guilty plea to six felony counts related to 
illegal securities trading 
in addition to his 10year term he was sentenced to three 
years probation and agreed to pay 600 million in penalties 
milken is to report to federal custody in march 
milken the former head of junk bonds at drexel burnham lambert 
inc admitted to conspiracy securities fraud violating federal 
securities guidelines mail fraud and helping to file a false tax 
return 
a spokesman for milken declined to comment of the notice of 
appeal 
criminal defendants normally do not have the right to appeal the 
length of a sentence but when a judge considers allegations of 
unadmitted crimes as wood did after a twoweek hearing in the 
milken case a defendant can try to argue that the hearing was 
unfair

business optimism is down sharply said dun amp bradstreets 
chief economist joseph w duncan softness in the domestic 
economy coupled with the uncertainty on the international scene 
due to events in the middle east has pushed expectations to their 
lowest levels in eight years 
despite oilprice inflation caused by the middle east crisis 
duncan said most businesses do not see opportunities to increase 
their own prices so profit expectations have dipped to very low 
levels 
the survey showed sales optimism fell in every major industry 
group particularly in retailing which has been weathering a rough 
christmas selling season historically its most critical time of 
year

oil prices showed little change thursday in 
lifeless trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
were a sea of tranquility out here said bob baker an 
analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
home heating oil contracts showed the most strength as traders 
responded to a forecast that frigid arctic weather might spread 
across much of the country but neither forecasts of weather nor 
forecasts of war were enough to lift the market out of its 
prechristmas doldrums 
heating oil rose 104 cents to 7888 cents a gallon on contracts 
for delivery in january heating oil for delivery in most later 
months showed modest losses 
crude oil which has been frozen into a narrow range of prices 
lately eased back with little fanfare though many traders are 
starting to view war in the persian gulf as more likely than peace 
contracts for delivery of light sweet crude in february fell 54 
cents to 2639 per barrel as traders kept watching for news that 
might indicate whether the united states and iraq would be able to 
agree on dates for discussing the middle east crisis 
crude for delivery in later months was also lower 
unleaded gasoline dropped for all delivery months with january 
contracts down 74 cent at 6668 cents a gallon 
traders had looked early in the session for heating oil to 
rally when it failed to move up very much they started selling 
off at the end of the day bringing down other prices 
the market was being bid up by the heating oil and when there 
was no followthrough it just turned around and collapsed at the 
close said brian tagler an oil broker with shearson lehman 
brothers inc with this holiday volume being so low they cant 
seem to get any momentum 
the days volume was some of the lightest on the mercantile 
exchange since before iraq invaded kuwait the market begins a 
fourday holiday weekend beginning saturday and many futures 
players have gotten out to avoid the risk that the oil crisis could 
unexpectedly change and hand them big losses 
natural gas prices which have been in a long decline amid the 
warm weather that persisited through much of the fall bounced back 
somewhat natural gas for february delivery was up 23 cents at 
1920 per 1000 cubic feet

the nations spending on health care climbed 
to a record of more than 604 billion last year federal officials 
said thursday 
the growth rate accelerated in 1989 just as it has done every 
year since 1986 and the amount spent added up to roughly 2400 
for every man woman and child in the country 
the ability of society to meet other needs is affected by the 
growing share of economic resources claimed by health 
expenditures said gail wilensky chief of the health care 
financing administration in releasing the new data 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said the 
growth in health costs is alarming it cuts some people off from 
medical care and puts a heavy financial burden on people who are 
using the system 
sullivan is leading a domestic policy council review of the 
nations health care system he has said he will present his 
recommendations after he evaluates two reports that are due out 
next year 
the secretary has rejected governmentfinanced national health 
insurance as a solution and said he favors continuation of a 
publicprivate system 
health spending in 1989 accounted for 116 percent of gross 
national product the total of all goods and services prdocued and 
was 111 percent higher than it was in 1988 the gross national 
product rose 67 percent over the same period 
the share of gnp was also a record as recently as 1985 the 
share was 105 percent 
federal spending on health programs in 1989 amounted to 147 
percent of the total federal budget of about 11 trillion up from 
141 percent of the previous years budget 
of the total spent on health care last year 33 percent was paid 
by private insurance 21 percent came from the pockets of 
consumers 17 percent was paid by medicare and 10 percent was paid 
by federalstate medicaid programs 
other government programs put in 15 percent and other private 
sources 4 percent according to the financing administrations 
figures 
the agency plans to publish a more detailed account of health 
spending next month 
it gave this breakdown of where each dollar went 
39 cents to hospitals 
19 cents to physicians 
8 cents to nursing homes 
22 cents was spent on dental and other professional services 
home health care drugs and vision products 
the remaining 12 cents paid for administration research and 
construction 
nearly 50 billion was spent on nursing home care of that 44 
percent of that was by paid directly by patients the great bulk of 
it 41 percent of the total out of social security income 
medicaid and medicare paid 51 percent of the bill and private 
insurance paid 1 percent 
overall percapita health spending would amount to 2360 based 
on an estimated 1989 population given by the health care financing 
administration of 256 million people however the census bureau 
has estimated that 1989 population was 248 million which would 
mean spending of 2435 per person the financing administration 
did not explain why it used a different population estimate

a former texas thrift owner dubbed the highest 
of the high fliers among the savings and loan crooks by attorney 
general dick thornburgh was convicted thursday of taking hundreds 
of thousands of dollars from depositors and spending it on himself 
an eightwoman fourman jury said don r dixon of dallas was 
guilty of illegally spending money from his vernon savings 
association on a california beach house and prostitutes the jury 
cleared him of charges he made illegal campaign contributions 
dixon 52 was the 11th person and eighth vernon officer to be 
convicted of criminal wrongdoing that contributed to the thrifts 
1987 failure which cost taxpayers 13 billion and was one of the 
first costly collapses of the savings and loan crisis 
ive felt better but i have no comment dixon said as he 
left the courthouse 
us district judge a joe fish set dixons sentencing for feb 
19 
convicted on 23 of 38 counts dixon faces a maximum sentence of 
115 years in jail and a 575 million fine said marvin collins 
us attorney for the northern district of texas prosecutors will 
seek a lengthy sentence he said 
dixons attorney billy ravkind said he had not decided whether 
to appeal 
don dixon was the highest of the high fliers among the savings 
and loan crooks thornburgh said in washington his excessive 
lifestyle and illegal management practices stood as a symbol of the 
wrongdoing in our national thrift industry 
clearly this is a major conviction not just for our district 
but nationwide collins said we have now convicted persons all 
the way from the bottom of the ladder to the top of the ladder at 
vernon 
woody lemons who was vernons chief executive officer was 
sentenced in april to 30 years in prison the stiffest penalty yet 
handed any figure in the savings and loan crisis 
dixon lemons and other vernon executives are also defendants in 
a 540 million federal fraud lawsuit that was filed in 1987 
dixon owned vernon from 1981 to 1986 it grew 10fold under his 
leadership with brokered deposits and speculative real estate deals 
and made a 50 million profit one year when dixon sold vernon in 
1986 more than 90 percent of its loans were not being repaid 
vernons net worth had sunk to a negative 71686 million when 
regulators took it over the next year 
testimony in the trial lasted more than five weeks with about 
two dozen witnesses including dixon the jury deliberated for 10 
days 
i think the verdict showed the jury was being very careful and 
selective collins said they were considering the evidence in 
all of the counts individually 
we believe it sends a message to the sampl community in the 
state of texas that their own citizens will hold them 
responsible said robert hauberg an assistant us attorney who 
prosecuted dixon 
jurors apparently disbelieved some former vernon employees who 
testified dixon directed them to reimburse themselves with the 
thrifts money for making political contributions dixon testified 
that he told the employees to check with attorneys before 
reimbursing themselves 
other former employees of dixons said he ordered the hiring of 
prostitutes for parties at a beach house near san diego they said 
dixon crafted a scheme to divert loan advances to pay rent on the 
house and doctored records to hide vernons ownership of the house 
from thrift regulators 
the house at solana beach calif was a hotel and office for 
vernon as it expanded into the southern california real estate 
market dixon testified he said that in hindsight hiring women to 
attend the parties was inappropriate but not illegal 
regulators found vernon owned 17th century castle doors and 
expensive art objects including a baccarat eagle and a 
silverstudded saddle the thrift also owned a yacht in washington 
used by some members of congress for parties

on the new york cotton exchange as the faint prospects for a

the second time this week

gold retreated crude oil futures fell grains and soybeans 
retreated and livestock and meat futures were mostly lower 
frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 5 cents to 995 
cents higher in new york with the contract for delivery in january 
up 995 cents at 120 a pound 
it was the highest settlement of a nearterm orange juice

although the cold air mass still needs to be watched and watched 
closely said ken clark expert senior forecaster with 
accuweather inc a private meteorological firm in state college 
penn

its going to get cold enough to cause problems in florida he 
said 
speculators dominated thursdays buying said celeste georkakis 
orange juice analyst with cargill investor services inc in new 
york 
many who had earlier bet on falling prices hurried to offset 
those positions by buying contracts she said thus reducing their 
exposure to a freeze during the fourday christmas trading break 
that begins saturday 
even if no freeze occurs this weekend the market likely will 
remain volatile until midjanuary when the florida orange harvest 
is over georkakis said

a committee formed by investor carl icahn 
demanded that usx corp supply a list of shareholders who could be 
canvassed about selling usxs energy operations documents 
disclosed thursday 
a cochairman of the committee wrote pittsburghbased usx on 
wednesday demanding the list to communicate with other stockholders 
on issues such as separating usxs steel and energy businesses 
dividend policy and corporate governance 
the letter written by john pound director of the corporate 
voting research project at harvard universitys kennedy school of 
government was disclosed in a filing icahn made with the 
securities and exchange commission 
last month icahn wrote usx chairman charles corry saying he was 
forming the committee and would seek a shareholders list to begin 
canvassing usx shareholders about its proposals 
those proposals include the possible sale of all or part of its 
energy operations and eliminating the shareholder rights plan or 
poison pill defense against possible takeovers 
the committee consists largely of law government and business 
professors at harvard and stanford universities and the university 
of chicago 
icahns fivepage letter to corry said the committee members 
would seek election to the usx board at the 1991 annual meeting 
unless it adopts a meaningful restructuring plan and corporate 
governance changes 
one member of the committee paul f quirk resigned tuesday to 
avoid the appearance of a conflict with his post as executive 
director of the massachusetts pension reserves investment 
management board 
icahn a takeover strategist who runs trans world airlines has 
been a thorn in the side of usx management for years but he has 
been laying low since last may when his proposal to spin off most 
of the usx steel business in the form of a shareholder dividend was 
rejected by other stockholders

a judge refused thursday to delay a japanese 
companys 66 billion buyout of entertainment giant mca inc and 
an attorney for the arizona company seeking to block the merger 
said he would appeal 
govideo inc a scottsdalebased distributor of a patented 
dualdeck vcr filed an antitrust action dec 6 claiming the mca 
buyout by matsushita electric industrial co violates us laws 
designed to encourage competition 
judge robert broomfield of us district court in phoenix denied 
govideos motion for a temporary restraining order saying he was 
simply not persuaded that the proposed merger is 
anticompetitive 
broomfield also said govideo failed to prove its claim that it 
would suffer irreparable damage were the restraining order not 
issued 
joseph alioto govideos san francisco lawyer said an appeal 
would be filed friday in the 9th circuit court of appeals in san 
francisco he said the court would be asked to stall the merger 
pending a final ruling 
if we do not prevail there we will file an appeal with the 
us supreme court alioto said and if we do not succeed in 
staying the merger we will proceed with the case and seek 
divestiture we will ask a judge to unscramble the egg that is 
about to be scrambled 
arguments during thursdays hearing on the temporary restraining 
order centered on whether the merger would cause irreparable damage 
to govideo and whether the company had to prove that it would 
suffer immediate losses 
alioto said he had to show only that there is a threat of 
significant damage 
the antitrust law is designed to block noncompetitive mergers 
before the damage actually is done he said 
dan schulman another govideo attorney said the mca buyout 
would hurt govideo and other electronics manufacturers by 
lessening competition 
the market will be altered so that anyone who goes into that 
market will be at a disadvantage anyone in that market will be at 
a disadvantage he said it will be more difficult for govideo 
to compete it will be more difficult for govideo to produce 
hardware for that market 
alioto said the mca deal coupled with sony corps recent 
purchase of columbia pictures is part of what he called a 
conspiracy by japanese manufacturers to gain control of the 
yettoemerge highdefinition television industry 
by controlling both the manufacture of the hardware and the 
making of the movies the japanese would be able to dictate which 
format is adopted in the united states for highdefinition 
television and eventually to dominate that market he argued 
these guys are looking at the future 20 years down the 
road he said 
but matsushitas lawyers said govideo had failed to prove that 
a temporary restraining order was warranted they argued that there 
has to be a showing of immediate irreparable damage 
under the antitrust language you have to show you have to 
demonstrate that you are going to get hurt and that you are going 
to get hurt fast said ira m millstein a new york lawyer for 
the defendants 
attorney michael biowitz representing mca said he believed not 
only that govideo failed to make a case for a temporary 
restraining order but that the antitrust case against the 
matsushitamca merger was weak as well 
these companies dont compete with each other in any market in 
the world he said

a federal appeals court ruled thursday that 
eastern airlines before rehiring replacement pilots in training 
must rehire pilots who went out on strike last year 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld a district court 
ruling that eastern may not hire new pilots who at the time the 
striking pilots agreed to return to work had not completed 
training and become certified by the federal aviation 
administration 
the ruling would displace about 200 of easterns 1900 pilots 
who were in training when the air line pilots association ended 
its strike in november 1989 also under the ruling no new trainees 
would be hired until all former strikers who wanted to return had 
been allowed to do so 
the union said as many as 800 pilots are seeking to get their 
jobs back 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the miamibased company 
had not yet reviewed the ruling but planned to appeal 
alpa went on strike on march 4 1989 in a show of sympathy with 
striking eastern machinists eastern then began hiring and training 
new pilots 
in august 1989 many eastern pilots offered to return to work 
but eastern said no pilot positions were available to former 
strikers easterns response was the same when the remaining pilots 
ended the strike three months later 
eastern placed the former strikers on an inactive recall list 
for future positions and filed suit against alpa declaring that 
new hire pilots in training are permanent replacements who may 
not be deprived of active employments by strikers 
alpa argued that pilot trainees are not permanent replacements 
under the federal railway labor act until they fully complete 
training and operate their required regular flights 
the atlantabased appeals court agreed in thursdays ruling 
saying the newly hired pilots are not permanent employees because 
they were not qualified to perform the work easterns pilots 
ordinarily discharged 
first the former strikers unlike the trainees have actually 
flown regular revenue flights for eastern the threejudge panel 
wrote second the returning pilots are only required to complete 
requalification training substantially less than the time 
required to train and qualify the new hire pilots 
joel gay office manager for the alpas eastern local in 
atlanta said the union was pleased with the ruling we had been 
anticipating it all along so were not surprised were just 
happy 
gay estimated the number of former strikers wanting to return to 
work at between 250 and 800 
ms ceremsak said eastern was not sure how many alpa members 
jobs were at issue

a share and a profit of 145million or 178 a share for the 
first nine months of this year the company made 74 million in the

rate increases 
administrative law judge robert e hollenshead recommended that 
the michigan public service commission let consumers impose 134 
billion in rate increases over 10 years 
if the commission adopts the recommendation which matches one 
by its staff the 450 million will go toward making up the 
difference between the amount requested and the amount granted 
knopick said 
consumers power spent 41 billion on the midland plant before 
construction was halted amid financing and legal problems in 1984

rupert murdoch said thursday he was pleased with progress on 
crucial debtrescheduling proposals but the international media 
groups stock value plunged 
murdoch issued a statement in reply to a query from the 
australian stock exchange after news corps share price plunged 
almost 23 percent to its lowest level this year the stock fell to 
420 austrialian dollars or 323 and later recovered to finish 
off 109 australian dollars or 84 cents at 435 australian 
dollars or 335 
in new york thursday the stock fell 87 cents to 750 
murdoch said he knew of no reason for the share slump and 
insisted a majority of bankers and other lenders had already 
indicated they agreed to news corps terms for a refinancing of 
688 billion in debt that comes due within the next three years 
analysts attributed much of thursdays share price fall to 
concern about a highly critical tv documentary to be shown on 
britains channel four thursday which concentrates on news corps 
financial position and its low tax payments 
the company is very peased with the progress of its 
negotiations for the rescheduling of the major part of the news

short and longterm debt close to default levels it described the 
groups financial position as extremely fragile and said its 
debts totaled 1066 billion 
the downgrade followed a similar move last month by usbased 
moodys investors service inc 
news corp executives have recently held meetings with bankers 
in australia the united states and europe murdoch plans to reduce
