the social democratic party gained a 
firm victory in schleswigholstein state sunday ending 38 years of 
rule by the conservative christian democrats 
the special election was called after a dirtytricks scandal 
rocked the state government last year 
bjoern engholm leader of the states social democrats and his 
supporters had failed to win a majority in elections last september 
but on sunday projections said the social democrats won 54 
percent of the vote assuring the party of 46 of the 74 seats in 
the legislature and that engholm would be governor 
the christian democrats were projected to receive about 33 
percent a loss of eight percent from september 
engholm was the target of a smear campaign last year involving 
allegations of improper sexual conduct the campaign was blamed on 
thengov uwe barschel who was found dead in a geneva hotel in 
october authorities ruled his death an apparent suicide 
projected results also showed the free democratic party which 
was allied with the christian democrats in the states coalition 
government had failed to receive the necessary five percent of the 
vote to stay in the legislature and lost its four seats 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said sunday night that the 
social democrats victory would not negatively affect his 
conseravative coalition in the federal government with the free 
democrats 
he attributed the social democrats victory to the barschel 
affair 
we went into the election from an unusually difficult 
position kohl said 
last september neither party could win enough seats to form a 
majority and elect a new governor 
barschel remained in office but then resigned when one of his 
aides disclosed details about the smear campaign against engholm in 
late september 
the christian democrats had entered heiko hoffmann the states 
justice minister to run against engholm in sundays balloting

build a better cage for an egg to crash in and 
the world may not beat a path to your door but it wont scramble 
your eggs either 
and it could help your physics grade at south terrebonne high 
school says physics teacher paul johnson whose 75 students at 
fridays egg drop competition used principles of mass inertia 
acceleration and toothpicks 
the idea build toothpick frames to cradle an egg during a 
20foot free fall distribute the shock of a crashlanding and keep 
the egg from breaking 
more than six dozen eggs didnt make the grade including 
johnsons which splattered when its shapeless case hit the ground 
and smashed into ah toothpicks 
i got the design from my friend in new york johnson said 
it worked for him but i changed it up a little i guess i should 
have stuck with the original design 
sixteenyearold junior casey portiers egg made it through its 
first drop into the center of a spherical array of interconnected 
triangles 
everyone was dropping theirs and it was flipping over and 
breaking he said i used symmetry so the weight was 
distributed evenly 
laurie ledet 17 a senior was less systematic her project 
looked like a bent soda can with a crown on top nonetheless it 
worked 
on caseys second drop the ball began to roll it bounced off 
the pavement and the egg began to ooze lauries egg survived a 
second drop with a cracked shell but the egg stayed inside 
well said johnson it looks like its going to be easy to 
distribute the awards

a month before he killed himself vincent van 
gogh painted a portrait in blue of his innkeepers young daughter 
the girl adeline ravoux 13 was on the terrace of the cafe in 
auvers a village outside paris when the artist returned from the 
fields his hands pressed to the bullet wound in his stomach two 
days later july 29 1890 van gogh died he was 37 years old 
on wednesday portrait of adeline ravoux will offered for 
sale at an auction of impressionist and modern paintings 
christies the auction house estimates that it will fetch more 
than 15 million 
experts say interest in the portrait is keen in part because of 
the story behind it 
the adolescent girl who posed for the painting said in an essay 
published in 1956 that she considered it somewhat of a 
disappointment at first but in her later years adeline ravoux 
carrie said she finally came to appreciate its insight into her 
character 
mrs carrie described van gogh who lived at her fathers inn 
during the last 2 months of his life as a disciplined artist and 
a soft and calm man who always smoked a pipe and enjoyed 
playing with her little sister 
she also recalled the last two days of the artists life during 
which he slowly succumbed to the fatal bullet 
a doctor came to dress the wound police officers arrived to 
investigate the suicide and the artists brother theo arrived 
running from the train station his face distorted by grief 
she wrote 
the portrait being auctioned wednesday is one of three versions 
van gogh painted when last offered for sale in 1980 at sothebys 
it brought 198 million from an anonymous buyer 
last year three of van goghs paintings fetched record 
multimillion dollar prices that shocked the art world the artist 
sold almost nothing during his lifetime 
in march 1987 van goghs sunflowers sold for 399 million 
at christies in london to a japanese firm yasuda fire amp marine 
insurance co three months later the trinquetaille bridge went 
for 202 million also at christies in london it was bought by 
an unidentified collector living in switzerland 
then in november history was made when van goghs irises 
a richlycolored composition of purple flowers and green leaves set 
off by a single white iris sold at sothebys in new york for 
539 million to an anonymous buyer it was the highest price paid 
at auction for any painting 
john rewald the author of postimpressionism from van gogh 
to gauguin has said of irises if a museum could have one 
painting by van gogh thats what it should get 
michael findlay christies senior vice president said he 
didnt think portrait of adeline ravoux would bring anywhere 
near the price paid for irises 
the special appeal of the portrait aside from the painting 
itself is its link to van goghs last days said findlay 
in the painting adeline dressed in blue sits in profile on a 
chair her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon her gaze is 
serene her posture correct and her hands folded demurely in front 
of her 
he observed her very deeply and when he came to paint her he 
painted both the grace and stiff awkwardness of an adolescent 
girl findlay said he used brief flashing strokes and 
astonishing color the background is almost an electric blue 
a night blue he said 
mrs carrie who died in 1965 at age 88 had written i admit 
that i was only moderately satisfied with my portrait it was 
somewhat of a disappointment for i did not find it was true to 
life but she also told an interviewer monsieur vincent 
divined not the young girl i was but the woman i was to become 
van gogh gave the first of his three versions of the portrait to 
the ravoux family more lifelike and detailed than the version up 
for auction it is now in a private collection in switzerland a 
third version that shows only the face and whose colors are less 
brilliant is owned by the cleveland museum of art

soap opera actors say their characters have 
started speaking see dick run johnny carson is actually tired 
of time off and bruce willis has taken up gardening as a 
scriptwriters strike enters week nine 
talks are suspended between the writers guild of america and the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers following the 
wgas walkout march 7 over residuals and creative control 
and theres no relief in sight with producer stephen cannell 
whos also a member of the guild saying things could drag on until 
january 
the writers guild is a very militant union academy 
awardwinning writer dan taradash said friday we believe in what 
we believe 
taradash a former guild president and former president of the 
motion picture academy of arts and sciences said the strike forced 
him to stop work on a nearly completed script about polish labor 
leader lech walesa 
a sequel to the movie annie also reportedly has been 
orphaned by the strike annie ii planned for a christmas 
release couldnt get final touches made on its script 
cbs which had hoped for a comeback in the fall after an 
unprecedented thirdplace finish this season announced april 28 
that it would push back the start of the new season from early 
septeber to late october at the earliest 
producers claim the strike has cost the industry more than 15 
million in lost jobs and production time with about 1400 clerical 
workers cast and crew members laid off 
the union struck when producers wanted to reformulate residual 
payments for hourlong television shows sold into syndication 
producers claim the shows are not selling well writers also want 
an increase of residuals from foreign markets and more control 
over changes in their scripts 
after nine weeks of reruns carson returns wednesday writing 
his own monologue and otherwise adlibbing his onehour nbc show 
carsons contract allowing him generous time off has been the 
subject of tonight show joking from time to time but the 
strikeforced vacation became no laughing matter carson said with 
longtime workers in his production company facing layoffs 
through a spokesman carson said that he was frustrated with 
efforts to reach an independent contract with the guild that would 
permit his scriptwriters to return 
talks with carson and at least 80 other independent producers 
are continuing scriptwriters voted april 14 not to grant 
independent contracts until it had a number of them in hand to 
avoid the divisiveness of only a few members returning to work 
arthur sellers a member of the guild negotiating committee 
said friday that it was possible the membership may decide to 
move ahead and sign independent contracts this month 
meanwhile the daytime soap operas have continued production 
scab scripts aint fun said actress norma connolly who 
plays aunt ruby on general hospital they make our days long 
and hard theyre illiterate she said wednesday as she walked a 
picket line with the guild 
you have to continue said jerry balme one of the shows 
producers you owe it to the audience and to the network he 
said adding we miss the writers we want them back 
the writing is getting to look like see dick run said 
actress peggy mccary of days of our lives 
labormanagement relations can be unusual in hollywood striking 
scriptwriter robert goethals said he is surviving on tuna fish 
sandwiches and loans from friends who also happen to be producers 
producer cannell also a member of the writers guild honors the 
strike and stays away from his typewriter 
since i was a writer first im not going to scab during the 
strike cannell said but he feels a conflict 
i dont think its going to settle on the writers guild terms 
no matter what they think i think it could go on to january if the 
wrong set of philosophies get used if they keep saying the 
companies are getting fat 
like many other producers cannell has cut paychecks in half as 
a means of keeping on staff cannell productions turns out such 
television series as hunter the ateam hardcastle amp 
mccormick and the rockford files 
meanwhile moonlighting star bruce willis has taken up 
gardening his abctv series shut down early because of a lack of 
scripts 
though hes not at work willis still has his problems 
im having a lot of trouble with snails willis said 
recently as he surveyed a tiny bed of marigolds and snapdragons

some kids call it the grocerystore 
school and some parents call it a godsend its a babysitting 
service at the supermarket that lets parents in peace and leaves 
more room in the cart for groceries 
its definitely helpful especially when a mother has only two 
hands and two children and is trying to grocery shop said 
35yearold karen redfearn who drives 17 miles from herrin to shop 
at the country fair store in carbondale 
its terrific she said 
located at the front of the country fair store the babysitting 
center has a color tv a video cassette recorder a 55gallon 
aquarium two bulletin boards five bean bags five plastic trucks 
and cars and stuffed animals 
but if junior still gets bored theres a 60piece set of wooden 
building blocks a xylophone an etchasketch a toy telephone and 
a toy cash register safety scissors glue and paint brushes 
crayons markers and paper complete the picture 
the 18by16foot area is a separate room from the store it has 
brown carpeted floors and its walls are decorated with drawings by 
the children 
big windows allow parents to check in on their youngsters while 
they shop 
my biggest problem is trying to get the kids to leave on 
time said sandy overstreet 23 coordinator of the carbondale 
center they like to go to grocerystore school some of the 
kids call it that 
the childcare center opened in october and entertained its 
6000th youngster this past week 
ive had a lot of positive comments from mothers from 
customers said store manager thomas j schmutz ive had a lot 
of older mothers tell me we shouldve done this 20 years ago 
the kids enjoy themselves more so than they enjoy grocery 
shopping said 32yearold connie hirsh shortly after picking up 
her yearold daughter at the center 
a minimum 25 purchase at the store entitles parents to up to 
two hours of free child care after two hours theres a 5anhour 
charge 
to ensure safety the same person who checks a child in must 
check him out and parents must remain on the store premises while 
the child is at the center 
children from age six months to six years are accepted 
the idea came from pete bradham of mount vernon owner of the 
five country fairs in the southern illinois area all but one offer

the people who moved onto the george ranch 
late in 1985 made friends easily nobody in this rural area where a 
mans background is his own business questioned their claim to have 
bought the ranch with an inheritance 
but the federal government alleges that the atoka county ranch 
north of stringtown was a cover for laundering more than 1 million 
in proceeds from international drug trafficking by claiming the 
money came from cattle sales 
federal authorities also allege the isolated 2889acre 
property since renamed the junior ranch was bought as a refuge 
for jose contreras subias a mexican national wanted for 
questioning in the torture slaying of a us drug enforcement 
administration agent the killings of nine venezuelan national 
guardsmen and the slaying of a mexican federal police officer 
contreras was arrested april 1 in salt lake city and is jailed 
in los angeles 
although federal officials now say they had been investigating 
the southeast oklahoma ranch for two years the lid started coming 
off when two texans stumbled onto a nearby marijuanagrowing 
operation in august they accused the owner of that ranch of 
abduction and details started emerging at the subsequent trial 
if he doesnt bother you then why bother him just because 
they came in with a lot of money said troy gammon atoka county 
clerk 
when the mexicans bought the ranch it was viewed as a logical 
investment of their money 
they told us they inherited it we believed them and we 
welcomed them to the community said atoka city manager martha 
yates we are still in shock 
residents knew contreras as joe or jose guillen people 
interviewed last week said he was a model citizen who made friends 
easily because of his gentel ways 
they were planting feed not dope said a businessman who 
would talk to a reporter only if his name were not used they 
came here to make it their home 
contreras drove a hard bargain and wrote checks for purchases 
rather than paying cash the businessman said most bigticket 
items were financed 
does that sound like they were laundering money he asked 
but residents reported to be closely associated with contreras 
now deny knowing him well people who attended parties at the ranch 
threaten lawsuits if their names are mentioned in connection with 
contreras 
contreras 42 originally was arrested in 1985 in costa rica 
with mexican drug king rafael caro quintero quintero is awaiting 
trial in the 1985 slaying of us dea agent enrique camarena 
contreras was sent to jail in tijuana mexico to stand trial 
for the slaying of a mexican federal agent but he escaped in 
october 1985 after bribing his jailers according to documents 
filed by dea agents 
two months before his escape a group of mexicans negotiated to 
buy the atoka county ranch from rancher eh george at a price of 
900000 plus 99000 for the cattle and hay according to an fbi 
affidavit 
the 500000 down payment originated as cashiers checks in 
tijuana on oct 22 1985 six days before contreras escape ten 
days after his escape a checking account was opened at the atoka 
state bank for jose guillen 
from november 1985 through september 1987 more than 14 
million was deposited in the atoka state bank account according to 
a federal affidavit neither the bank nor its officers has been 
accused of wrongdoing more money went into a bank in durant 
contreras alleged operation began to come unraveled in august 
when two texans rode their threewheelers onto the bar20 ranch 
they said they were shot at abducted and held in chains before 
they escaped 
police raided the ranch and discovered more than 6700 marijuana 
plants ranch owner elbert lucien johnson and two codefendants 
were convicted of running one of the states largest marijuana 
farms 
at the trial testimony brought up small details linking the two 
ranches and the people associated with them among other things 
authorities allege johnson provided the introductions for the 
mexicans to buy the george ranch 
weve been aware that they were there for a long time us 
attorney roger hilfiger said of the junior ranch he said johnsons 
arrest let the cat out of the bag 
the day after contreras arrest federal authorities raided the 
junior ranch and another property near plano texas and seized 
documents they are still studying they also filed notice of 
intention to seize the ranch and other property as the proceeds of 
illegal drug transactions 
no criminal charges have been filed related to the operation of 
the junior ranch but a federal grand jury convenes may 31 in 
muskogee

a ballot proposal to authorize horse racing and 
parimutuel betting was approved saturday in dallas county and by 
a narrow margin in lubbock county where church leaders opposed it 
they were the only two texas counties voting on the issue 
saturday other counties voted in november when residents 
statewide approved a proposal to let counties determine whether to 
allow wagering on horses 
with 98 percent of the precincts reporting the vote in dallas 
county was 40793 or 56 percent for parimutuel betting and 
31626 or 44 percent against 
the final tally in lubbock county was 18939 or 52 percent for 
parimutuel betting and 17541 or 48 percent against 
throughout the state voters were also electing mayors city 
councilmen and school trustees 
the voting stirred limited interest in dallas county where 
elections administrator bruce sherbet said he expected only about 
10 percent of the registered voters to turn out 
but lubbock city secretary ranette boyd said her telephone was 
kept busy with calls from people wanting to know where they could 
vote she predicted a lubbock county turnout almost twice that of 
the last general election 
parimutuel betting was the most volatile issue on the ballot in 
the county since a narrow vote almost 20 years ago to legalize 
mixeddrink sales 
proponents of horse race betting tout it as a 
multimilliondollar economic boon opponents say it will lead to 
crime and compulsive gambling 
citizens against parimutuel gambling campaigned against the 
proposition largely through a mailing to 100 local churches said 
gene glaeser minister of broadway church of christ in lubbock 
in the austin mayoral race incumbent mayor frank cooksey came 
in second to former city councilman lee cooke but six other 
candidates split enough votes to force a runoff

and lodged under a pier in san francisco bay on saturday officials 
said 
mary jane schramm a spokeswoman with the california marine 
mammal center in sausalito said it wasnt immediately known if the 
whale was dead when it washed under pier 70 or if it died after 
getting under the structure 
the whale had deep slash marks on its head and some of them 
involved the animals blow hole which allows it to inhale and 
exhale said schramm 
schramm feared the marks could have been caused by a ships 
propeller but she did not rule out the possibility they were made 
by a veterinarian who examined the dead whale after it was found 
he could not be reached for comment 
whales often hug the california coastline while migrating 
between arctic waters and the warmer baja california waters from 
january through may schramm said 
authorities were relieved to learn that the dead whale was not 
the juvenile whale that was spotted several times in recent weeks

everyone was so busy marching and judging 
and eating strawberries that hardly anyone noticed the homemade 
shortcake had taken a big splat and had to be replaced with the 
storebought variety 
beauty queens and high school bands marched through this town of 
2000 and judges tasted every variety of strawberry recipe as north 
carolinians celebrated their 56th strawberry festival 
the weekend fair billed as the states oldest agricultural 
festival drew hundreds of entries and thousands of spectators 
i dont think anybody has noticed that the cakes were 
storebought said jack yates 
he was supposed to deliver 15 large sheet cakes baked by the 
women of his fraternal society based in another town a few miles 
away but the cakes fell out of the back of the pickup 
yates said he and a fellow lodge member heard something when 
a large truck passed them we got out went around and looked 
and sure enough all the cake was in little pieces all over the 
highway 
they beat it to a local supermarket and bought up as much pound 
cake as they could find enough to make the approximately 1500 
servings needed

it was with some trepidation that pat 
bagley cartoonist for the salt lake tribune opened the package 
from retiring salt lake city police chief e l bud willoughby 
after all bagley had lampooned the chief more than once about 
the day in 1980 when willoughby popped a trash can over his head 
and gingerly carried a what looked like a bomb out of a bank the 
bomb turned out to be a bundle of highway flares 
the moment was captured on film and published in the newspaper 
and there are those who believe to this day that willoughby 
secretly wished he could have crawled underneath that can and 
stayed there until the cameras were gone 
so it wasnt surprising that bagley took cover beneath his own 
trash can and cautiously peeled away the tape on the cardboard box 
the precautions were unnecessary so were bagleys concerns that 
maybe willoughby didnt like him so well 
the box contained one of willoughbys prized possessions the 
official salt lake city bomb squad helmet given him by 
thoughtful patrolmen after the bank incident 
its a gunmetal gray trash can resplendent with official salt 
lake city police patches visor and a peephole

the president of the american psychiatric 
association is accused in a probate dispute of exploiting a woman 
who gave him 80000 a year in trusts and willed 5 million to a 
psychiatric institute she founded during a decade of psychoanalysis 
with him 
the legal battle is between dr george pollock one of chicagos 
leading psychoanalysts and francis l lederer ii only child of 
anne p lederer who died in 1984 at age 78 
pollock denies any wrongdoing 
mrs lederer left most of her estimated 5 million estate to a 
nonprofit institute she established four years earlier to promote 
psychiatric research and music none of the money has been paid 
however because her son is contesting her will in cook county 
probate court a trial is scheduled to begin july 5 
lederer accused pollock of improperly using his influence while 
treating his mother for depression to urge her to create the 
institute and wrongfully inducing her to bequeath her fortune 
to it according to court documents 
pollock who was attending the annual meeting of the association 
in montreal referred calls for comment to his attorney robert 
tepper of chicago tepper said he had advised pollock not to 
discuss the case 
but pollock denied the allegations in an affidavit dec 4 1986 
i never made false representations to her for the purpose and 
with the intent of improperly controlling dominating and 
misleading her and unduly influencing and wrongfully inducing her 
to execute her last will pollock said 
tepper said he saw no support or substantiation for claims 
that mrs lederer was incompetent or unduly influenced 
but anyone can file a lawsuit and these days it has become a 
recognized means of social expression he added 
dr larry strasburger a harvard medical school psychiatrist who 
reviewed pollocks conduct in mrs lederers case at the request of 
her sons attorneys contended in a deposition that there were 
grounds for a malpractice suit he was paid 200 an hour as an 
expert witness 
strasburger said he reviewed mrs lederers prescription records 
and found she was taking enough medication to become 
psychologically and physically addicted 
pollock who will step down as president when the associations 
annual meeting ends thursday also is director of the chicago 
institute for psychoanalysis and a northwestern university medical 
school professor 
pollock conducted up to five sessions a week with mrs lederer 
from 1969 to 1980 when he transferred her case to two other 
psychiatrists saying he needed more time for other professional 
duties court documents show 
pollock continued prescribing medication for her until 1983 and 
records show he told the succeeding psychiatrists in a letter 
incidentally i do hope that you are charging her a full fee 
for your housecalls and visits she can well afford it 
during the years mrs lederer was a patient of pollock 
she established a trust fund that has paid pollock 50000 a 
year since 1976 and will continue paying him through 1993 she 
established a second trust that has paid pollocks family 30000 a 
year since 1978 court records arent clear when the second trust 
expires 
from 1969 until her death mrs lederer donated 601330 to the 
chicago institute for psychoanalysis of that money 60233 went 
to a depression research fund controlled by pollock 
in 1980 she created the anne p lederer research institute 
pollock worked for a short time as a paid consultant to the 
institute but said in his affidavit that there is no secret 
agreement for him to participate in its future operations he 
also denied receiving any benefit from mrs lederers will 
mrs lederer dismissed her longtime attorneys when they 
expressed reservations about her institute and hired chicago lawyer 
leonard schanfield a friend of pollock 
in 1982 she amended her will to leave 200000 to her son 
several thousand dollars to two grandchildren and the rest of her 
money estimated at 5 million to the lederer research 
institute she also named pollock schanfield and continental 
illinois national bank amp trust co as coexecutors of her estate 
tepper said mrs lederers son was worth about 2 million before 
her death and that when she died he inherited about 6 million from 
a trust established by her father ej pollock vice president and 
comptroller of sears roebuck amp co in the 1930s the two pollock 
families are not related 
mrs lederer referred to her sons wealth to explain in her last 
will why she was leaving most of her money to my foundation 
schanfield said mrs lederer told him that he was one of four 
lawyers referred to her by pollock to review her estate planning 
and help her establish the research institute 
dr pollock played no role whatsoever in establishing that 
institute schanfield said friday in a telephone interview 
mrs lederer set it up 
in their briefs attorneys for mrs lederers son kevin 
murnighan and phil doran suggest she was dependent on pollock 
the attorneys contended that after mrs lederers husband a 
doctor died in 1973 dr pollock took the place of her husband 
and he constantly advised her on all facets of life from where she 
was going to live to what she was going to eat to what medical 
treatment to get to what raises to give the housekeeper 
tepper said mrs lederer and pollock were friends and that the 
psychiatrist accepted her financial gifts because there was no 
reason not to accept them a point of ethical debate 
but strasburger wrote his acceptance of large gifts to his 
family his institution and himself occurred in a pattern of 
conduct evidencing gross disregard for psychoanalytic principle and 
psychiatric propriety 
dr robert weinstock a psychiatrist and associate professor at 
the university of california at los angeles medical school said he 
knew of no specific guidelines on ethics that prohibit 
psychiatrists from accepting gifts or donations from patients 
i can say that it would be unusual while somebody is in 
treatment to accept large gifts he said in a telephone 
interview its not standard to do that 
the american psychiatric associations principles of medical 
ethics do not contain a specific provision against accepting money 
or other gifts from patients beyond professional fees 
but the principles do say a psychiatrist should not use the 
unique position of power afforded him by the psychotherapeutic 
situation to influence the patient in any way not directly relevant 
to the treatment goals

a boston effort to relieve runway congestion 
by increasing landing fees for small planes is evolving into a 
national debate over the role of major airports 
what was a local dispute involving logan international airport 
has spilled over to congress the department of transportation and 
the federal aviation administration 
this is just the first foot over the line said rep 
sherwood boehlert rny who has introduced legislation designed 
to block logan from implementing the plan there are airports all 
over the country sort of foaming at the mouth just waiting to 
follow suit 
but rep edward j markey dmass said that deteriorating 
air traffic gridlock justifies logans goal of encouraging small 
aircraft to use other airfields in the area saying its a 
balancing of equities 
logan faces a problem common to many airports air traffic and 
delays are growing but expansion is unrealistic because of 
neighborhood opposition a lack of available land and enormous 
construction costs 
so the massachusetts port authority or massport the state 
agency that operates logan has announced a plan it says will 
permit more efficient use of the airport by 23 million passengers 
annually 
as of july 1 landing fees for private planes and commuter 
airlines will be increased from the current minimum of 25 to an 
average of close to 100 the costs for large airliners now 
hundreds of dollars will drop by varying amounts 
massport has concluded that the test of efficiency at logan is 
not the number of airplanes landed per hour but the number of 
people handled per hour with a minimum of delay the agencys 
executive director david w davis said when the plan was approved 
march 16 in other words a 747 with 400 people on board deserves 
a higher priority than a cessna with two people on board 
the commuter airline corporate aircraft and private plane 
industries say the logan plan is unfair because they have as much 
right to use the governmentsupported airport as airlines do and 
the higher fees will hurt their businesses they say 
we price our service at what we think the market will stand 
said john fredericksen executive vice president of the regional 
airline association which represents the nations commuter 
carriers if we thought that extra money was out there wed 
charge it 
officials of the small plane industry fear that logans plan may 
be only the beginning of restrictions across the country 
although air traffic grows every year the last major us 
metropolitan airport dallasfort worth international was 
completed in 1974 no new airports are under construction although 
two cities denver and austin are moving toward building new 
ones and about a dozen others hope to add runways at existing 
airfields 
since new airports take at least four years to build and cost 
15 billion to 2 billion existing fields are moving to make 
better use of what they have modern air traffic equipment will 
allow more frequent takeoffs and landings but it is expensive and 
in many cases needs further development 
as delays grow more airfields are considering shunting some of 
their small plane traffic elsewhere by raising fees particularly 
during busy morning and evening hours 
the port authority of new york and new jersey which operates 
john f kennedy laguardia and newark airports is expected in 
september to impose slight rush hour increases in takeoff fees for 
small planes 
massport spokesman tom champion declined to name airports that 
have contacted his agency but conceded there are a lot of people 
watching us with great interest 
said fredericksen of the regional airline group our concern 
is that airports will try to limit traffic rather than expand 
capacity 
boehlerts bill and an identical senate version cosponsored by 
seven northeastern lawmakers face uncertain futures the 1988 
congressional schedule is a short one and committee chairmen say 
they have not decided whether to even hold hearings for the 
legislation 
but rep bob carr dmich a private plane pilot said he will 
try attaching an amendment to a spending bill this month that would 
kill the logan plan and discourage other airports from adopting 
similar restrictions 
this is a national airspace system and here we have one 
airport trying to make policy he said 
opponents of the logan program have opened other fronts small 
plane industry groups have filed federal lawsuits in boston and 
also have asked the faa and transportation department to step in on 
their behalf 
supporters of logans efforts say however that similar plans 
are inevitable 
its the wave of the future said rep charles schumer 
dny as the skies get more crowded rational pricing policies 
will be imposed at other airports and logan is blazing the trail

the senate is expected to open debate on the 
new ussoviet missile treaty this week provided the white house 
and the kremlin can resolve lastminute questions over verification 
provisions and the use of futuristic technology 
were still conferring with the senate and hope to come to a 
resolution by tuesday evening an administration official said 
we have discussed this with the soviets and we feel confident 
it can be resolved said the official who asked not to be 
identified 
while only a handful of senators are on record as opposed to the 
treaty it is an open question whether there is time to ratify it 
before president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev open 
their moscow summit meeting on may 29 
senate majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia 
resisting appeals from reagan has said he will not be driven by 
the approaching summit or by any other outside factor 
last month byrd set wednesday as a tentative date for the 
opening of debate on the intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf 
treaty if the outstanding issues can be resolved 
on monday and tuesday the senate will consider legislation 
authorizing 2995 billion in spending for the pentagon the bill 
also calls for increased spending on nonnuclear weapons in the 
north atlantic treaty organization to help reduce soviet 
superiority in such arms 
three senate committees intelligence armed services and 
foreign relations will spend monday and tuesday looking for ways 
to resolve the four outstanding issues 
futuristic weapons byrd wants a legally binding written 
commitment from the kremlin setting out the extent to which the new 
treaty covers mediumrange weapons using laser rays particle beam 
generators or other technology still on the drawing boards 
futuristic weapons verification byrd wants a senate 
intelligence committee report on the ability of us intelligence 
agencies to verify a ban on futuristic weapons 
verification byrd wants the soviets to make clear they will 
live up to treaty terms that require intrusive onsite inspection 
to detect cheating some soviet officials have been quoted as 
saying certain practices would not be allowed on soviet soil byrd 
told reporters recently he wants to make sure the soviets are not 
backing away from treaty requirements 
intelligence byrd wants a reagan administration commitment 
that it will significantly increase longrange spending for us 
intelligence efforts to monitor soviet compliance with treaties 
including obtaining more effective spy satellites 
reagan and gorbachev signed the inf treaty in a white house 
ceremony last dec 8 
since then the pact has been subjected to intense scrutiny by 
the foreign relations committee which has primary jurisdiction 
over treaties as well as by the armed services and intelligence 
panels each focusing on their areas of expertise 
if it goes into effect the pact would require the elimination 
of us and soviet groundlaunched missiles with ranges between 300 
and 3400 miles 
a leading sticking point in the controversy over whether or not 
futuristic weapons are included in the mediumrange weapon ban is 
the fact the treaty contains no definition of exactly what 
constitutes a weapon delivery vehicle 
us negotiators testified that they and their soviet 
counterparts made no attempt to define terms that had a generally 
understood meaning and that the word weapon fell into that list 
maynard glitman the chief us negotiator testified that while 
the subject of futuristic weapons was never specifically raised in 
the negotiations the term weapon delivery vehicle covers any 
mediumrange missile however armed if it is able to destroy a 
target 
an initial soviet attempt last month to resolve the issue went 
awry in confusion over differences in two translations of a letter 
from soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze to secretary of 
state george p shultz 
during the defense bill debate amendments are likely to both 
increase spending for nato and also call for us allies in the 
16nation alliance to pay more of natos costs 
also expected are proposals providing advice to reagan from both 
conservative republicans and liberal democrats about the arms 
control policies he should follow in the last six months of his 
administration 
the house is expected to give final approval wednesday to its 
pentagon bill similar action by the senate will send the separate 
measures to a housesenate conference committee to reconcile the 
differences

without textbooks this fall because of a worsening paper shortage

the rising cost of making paper hoarding by speculators who resell 
it for profit and a stateordered cut in imports

in the past there have been tensions between relief 
organizations and the government which bans contacts with rebels 
they took up arms against the government of this east africa 
nation in 1983 demanding more autonomy and economic reforms since 
then fierce fighting has forced hundreds of thousands of 
southerners to flee to towns and cities where they depend on 
relief food 
government officials who banned the four relief groups said they 
were no longer needed but other sources said the government acted 
mainly because the groups had contacted rebels to arrange for 
transport of food supplies to civilians caught in the cross fire 
the rebels who control more than 90 percent of the southern 
countryside have been attacking relief convoys they claim the 
government uses them to transport military troops and supplies

a turk who was acquitted of conspiracy 
in the shooting of pope john paul ii has been detained in france 
it was reported sunday 
the istanbul daily hurriyet quoted sabahattin cakmakoglu 
general director of the security department of the interior 
ministry as saying french authorities notified them friday of the 
detention of oral celik 
cakmakoglu told hurriyet he did not have any other details 
other turkish dailies quoted unidentified interior minister 
officials as saying they too were notified friday night about 
celiks detention 
celik is wanted in turkey on charges of complicity in the 1979 
murder of abdi ipekci a liberal newspaper editor in istanbul and 
of murder in the killing of a teacher nevzat yildirim three 
months later in malatya 
cakmakoglu said turkey had reiterated to france its request for 
celiks extradition 
in march 1986 a court in rome found celik three bulgarians and 
two turks innocent of charges of conspiring to kill the pope on may 
13 1981 in st peters square 
another turk mehmet ali agca was convicted of trying to kill 
john paul and was sentenced to life in prison celik had been 
described as agcas right arm and best friend 
the prosecutor had asked for a life sentence for celik who was 
at large and tried in absentia on charges of firing at the pope 
with agca celik was acquitted for lack of evidence 
under italian law acquittal for lack of evidence does not 
amount to a complete finding of innocence it means that the court 
believes there is a possibility of guilt but that it did not hear 
enough evidence to support a conviction 
turkish officials were not immediately available to comment on 
the reports of his detention in paris the foreign ministry said 
it had no comment on the reports

city officials have installed 
about 450 concrete trash cans downtown in a bid to limit damage and 
injuries from frequent bomb attacks 
the bins have been designed to cause the least possible damage 
in the event of an explosion a city official told the sunday 
times newspaper 
they are as near bombproof as its humanly possible to make 
them he said of the thick concrete bins 
two years ago the city removed 1300 metal trash cans and 2500 
polemounted bins and replaced them with mesh baskets in hopes that 
making the contents of bins more visible would deter bombers 
new bins have been placed in the middle of city blocks instead 
of on corners to make it more difficult for someone to 
surreptitiously plant bombs 
there have been more than 70 bombings in south africa since the 
government imposed a nationwide emergency in 1986 and many have 
been in the johannesburg area 
police have blamed virtually all of the attacks on the outlawed 
african national congress the main black group fighting to 
overthrow the government

moslem guerrillas on sunday claimed 
they killed 300 afghan army troops and captured 120 as they overran 
another communist government post in eastern afghanistan 
a statement by the sevenmember alliance of guerrilla parties 
said it got news of the victory in a radio report late saturday 
at the same time afghanistans radio kabul was reporting it had 
inflicted heavy losses on guerrillas at the same place 
capturing scores of rockets mortars machine guns mines and 
ammunition 
the radio monitored in islamabad did say when that fighting 
took place 
both reports placed the battle at chamkani nine miles west of 
the pakistan border in paktia province 
the guerrillas said they attacked retreating afghan forces and 
destroyed 12 tanks and 18 armored personnel carriers 
the fleeing enemy forces could not take away their dead 
bodies the statement said on the mujahedeen side 30 were 
martyred and 80 others were injured 
it said that on sunday soviet and afghan forces were still 
bombing and shelling the areas of chamkani and jaji it said 
guerrillas were sniping at the retreating forces on the highway 
leading west to logar province 
if the guerrilla report was accurate it would add to the list 
of at least six sovietafghan positions overrun in two weeks 
soviet forces reportedly have been pulling back from bases in 
eastern afghanistan in preparation for their total withdrawal 
scheduled to begin may 15 soviet forces intervened in afghanistan 
in december 1979 to back the afghan government in its war with the 
guerrillas 
afghan security forces wellequipped but reportedly sagging in 
morale have had little success in facing the usarmed guerrillas 
alone 
the insurgents based in peshawar pakistan claim hundreds of 
afghan army fighters have deserted to the guerrillas since moscow 
announced its intention early this year to end its military 
involvement in afghanistan 
two weeks ago the guerrillas announced a major offensive aimed 
at pushing toward kabul the afghan capital 
on april 22 the guerrillas captured a major sovietafghan 
garrison at barikot just a few steps from the pakistan frontier 
it opened a key new supply route for insurgents operating east 
north and west of kabul

prime minister margaret thatcher says some of her 
male colleagues resent a woman running the country 
yes it is rather patronizing the best compliment they can 
give a woman is that she thinks like a man i say she does not she 
thinks like a woman mrs thatcher said in an interview with the 
sunday times 
mrs thatcher 62 last week marked nine years in power the 
longest of any prime minister this century 
she is one of only 41 women in the 630member house of commons 
she agreed with interviewer brtian walden that some of the men 
there are puzzled because she doesnt fit their image of women as 
dithery and weak 
the house is still very much maledominated and there is 
something about them a sort of little woman thing it would be 
all right if i had gone into what they would regard as one of the 
traditional professions all right if i had followed florence 
nightingale all right you know if i had gone into teaching 
she said 
florence nightingale is regarded as the founder of modern 
nursing for her lifesaving work among soldiers during britains 
crimean war with russia in 1854 
mrs thatchers conservative party has won all three general 
elections it contested under her leadership and she said she hopes 
to lead it into the next election in 1991 and maybe the one after 
that 
she said she wont step down until she believes her party has 
enough younger people committed to her policies 
mrs thatcher rejected suggestions she is authoritarian and 
ruthless in her effort to turn britain round and restore the 
british sense of enterprise and initiative 
the view i take is that a prime minister has a task of 
leadership if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall 
prepare himself to the battle all right so i give a certain 
sound she said 
mrs thatcher greatly admired her father a grocer and alderman 
in a small town but she said there were people who disliked her 
success because they despised her origins 
some of them are snobs she said they can never forgive 
me for coming from a very ordinary background it does not bother 
me at all i cannot stand snobbery of any kind

the murder rape and robbery rate in the 
united states was several times higher than in europe in the early 
1980s at a time when overall us crimes rates were declining a 
newly issued government study said sunday 
in 1984 the united states had 79 homicides 357 rapes and 
2054 robberies per 100000 people concluded the study by the 
bureau of justice statistics 
the european nations the same year had an average of 15 
homicides 54 rapes and 491 robberies per 100000 people 1984 is 
the latest year for which comparative figures were available 
rates for other crimes also were higher in the united states 
however the difference in property crime rates was not as great 
in 1984 the us burglary rate was 20 percent higher than in 
europe us rates for auto theft and larceny were about double the 
average in europe 
from 1980 to 1984 the rate for crimes reported to police in the 
united states fell for each offense studied except for rape the 
declines ranged from 12 percent for auto theft to 24 percent for 
burglary 
meanwhile the average crime rates for europe and for canada 
australia and new zealand collectively increased for all crimes 
except murder in the early 1980s 
the us rates for violent crime in 1984 also were higher than 
those in canada australia and new zealand but the differences 
were smaller than those with europe and data from the 
international police organization shows a burglary rate for canada 
australia and new zealand that is about 40 percent higher than the 
us rate 
the study examined homicide rape robbery larceny burglary 
and auto theft because those are the crimes most likely to be 
understood and defined in the same general way from country to 
country

danes on tuesday will be faced with 
the tricky choice between their nato allies and their longstanding 
opposition to nuclear weapons in one of the countrys most 
important elections since world war ii 
the sudden storm over denmarks role in the 16nation alliance 
came as a surprise to many voters usually more worried about 
unemployment and national debt than military issues a ban on 
nuclear weapons in peacetime has already been in effect for three 
decades 
the showdown began april 14 when the opposition led by the 
social democrats pushed through a parliamentary resolution 
requiring the government to notify visiting warships of the nuclear 
arms ban 
the united states and britain never confirm or deny the presence 
of nuclear weapons on their ships 
the allies reacted sharply saying the move jeopardized 
denmarks participation in the north atlantic treaty organization 
a meeting of natos nuclear planning group was rescheduled from 
denmark to belgium britain called off several royal navy port 
visits 
prime minister poul schlueter a nato supporter called a 
general election asking voters to take a stand on the issue 
has the danes national pride deteriorated so much that we 
will bow to pressure from abroad the leftleaning newspaper 
information asked in a frontpage editorial 
the question is the central one in the current debate and in 
that sense the election is the most important since the second 
world war 
it didnt help matters when reagan administration spokesman 
marlin fitzwater joked to reporters that danish means breakfast 
to me 
national radio played the englishlanguage tape on the air an 
unusual step and the liberal politiken newspaper printed the 
sarcastic headline reagan staff demonstrates its knowledge of 
denmark fitzwater later apologized 
the confrontation comes at a politically unstable time for this 
country of 51 million the last general election in september left 
schlueters fourparty coalition holding just 70 of the folketings 
179 votes but with enough support to command a majority on 
economic matters 
tuesdays vote is not a direct referendum on nato but a vote 
for representatives in the folketing what happens afterward 
depends on how many votes are split among the social democrats the 
biggest single party schlueters centerright coalition and a 
handful of smaller parties 
polls indicate that while most danes agree with the traditional 
antinuclear position many have contradictory feelings about nato 
one survey said 82 percent of those asked favored a nuclearfree 
zone in scandinavia and 46 percent said they would support the 
idea even if it meant denmarks expulsion from nato 
but a recent poll by the observa organization showed that 66 
percent of danes favor staying in nato and just 16 percent oppose 
membership the most lopsided margin in years 
another published survey showed that 46 percent of danes 
believed it was reasonable to ask nato ships to guarantee they 
carry no nuclear arms 36 percent did not and 18 percent were 
undecided 
denmarks lowlying peninsula and islands command the approaches 
to the baltic sea and nato strategists envision it as a key supply 
point in case of a soviet invasion 
the natodanish clash follows years of contention over denmarks 
declining defense spending which now amounts to 21 percent of its 
gross national product among the lowest in the alliance 
but in random interviews with window shoppers along stroeget a 
pedestrian street in the heart of copenhagen voters seemed more 
worried about domestic matters than global politics 
its not just a question about nuclear weapons but about the 
way the government runs society said susane nielsen a 
conservative voter who works in a health insurance office we 
have to face these economic problems 
unemployment is running at 97 percent with a national debt 
worth more than 43 billion the national bank has warned that 
denmarks currency could run into trouble unless costs are kept 
under control 
joergen thy editor and writer for a computer magazine said he 
planned to vote against the government because i dont think they 
have achieved much 
the nuclear question 
thats a joke thats not the issue something went wrong in 
the corridors he said 
the nonuclear notification letter the cause of the fuss has 
yet to be written its likely the note would simply restate 
national policy without requiring a response from the ships 
commanders 
defense setbacks are nothing new for the danish government the 
april 14 resolution was its 23rd loss in parliament since 1982 on a 
defense question it passed by 75 to 58 with 46 lawmakers absent 
but the timing of the resolution as the united states and 
soviet union discuss further cutbacks in nuclear weapons probably 
touched a nerve on the american side speculated nikolaj petersen 
a professor of political science at aarhus university 
when the usa reacts vigorously it could therefore be 
linked to the fact that denmark has contested an important american 
negotiating position he wrote in det fri aktuelt newspaper

a group of federal regulators working on ways 
to prevent another stock market crash appears certain to clash with 
activist members of congress who want to do more than the 
antiregulation reagan administration 
the group appointed in midmarch is chaired by treasury under 
secretary george d gould and includes the heads of the federal 
reserve board securities and exchange commission and commodity 
futures trading commission 
according to two sources familiar with its deliberations the 
focus of groups recommendations is likely to be improved 
communication and cooperation among both exchanges and regulatory 
agencies rather than jurisdictional changes requiring new 
legislation 
if that is the case it will not satisfy either sen william 
proxmire dwis chairman of the senate banking committee or rep 
edward j markey dmass chairman of the finance subcommittee of 
the house energy and commerce committee 
however one of the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity cautioned that the gould groups positions were still 
fluid and could change before it reports to president reagan the 
week of may 16 
and pressure on the group to recommend more than it apparently 
had intended increased on two fronts last week 
an earlier white house panel headed by wall street investment 
banker nicholas f brady issued a statement warning that 
regulatory turf fights should not be permitted to sidetrack market 
reform which it said will inevitably require legislation 
and according to one of the sources sec chairman david s 
ruder has made it clear he will stake out an independent position 
if the gould groups final report does not go far enough 
ruder has urged that his own agency which regulates the stock 
markets be given additional authority over stock index futures 
which currently fall under the jurisdiction of the commodities 
futures trading commission 
at the very least he wants tiebreaking authority to 
resolve disputes during emergencies such as the record oct 19 
decline of 508 points in the dow jones average 
both cftc chairwoman wendy l gramm and federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan are opposing jurisdictional changes 
proxmire has introduced a bill that would create a threemember 
committee to coordinate regulation it would consist of the 
chairmen of the sec cftc and the federal reserve the fed chairman 
would head the committee but disputes would be resolved by 
majority vote 
markeys staff is still working on legislation and is unlikely 
to be finished before the gould group reports to the president 
according to an aide who asked not to be identified by name 
however markey has said the sec not the cftc should regulate 
stock index futures 
the administration working group appears likely to recommend 
only one of the changes sought by legislators and the brady panel 
brief coordinated circuit breakers to break the momentum of a 
soaring or plunging market one of the sources said 
agreement on margin levels the amount of money required to 
make an investment in either the stock or futures markets was 
still within the realm of possibility but less likely because 
of strong disagreement between ruder and gramm the source said 
futures margins are higher than they were before the oct 19 
stock market crash but ruder has said further increases are 
needed gramm reflecting the views of the industry her agency 
regulates has resisted 
the federal reserve sets stock and stock option margins while 
the individual futures exchanges set their own margins according 
to the source treasury department officials also believe ideally 
that stock and option exchanges ought to set their own margins 
however the brady panel in its statement last week said 
marginsetting was too important to leave to the exchanges it said 
the fed is the logical agency to set all equity margins to ensure 
their harmony with one another 
according to markeys aide the massachusetts congressman sides 
with the brady panel on that issue and is considering including in 
any legislation a direction that stocks and futures margins be not 
just harmonious but equivalent 
that would be controversial gramm and executives of the chicago 
futures exchanges argue that stock and futures margins serve 
different purposes and need not be the same 
other tentative provisions of markeys bill would give the sec 
power to impose trading halts and take other action during market 
emergencies 
the legislation also is likely to prohibit crossmarket 
frontrunning some brokerage firms have been accused of profiting 
in either the stock or futures market by trading for their own 
accounts in front of a major trade by a big client like a mutual or 
pension fund in the other market 
the gould group from the start faced criticism from proxmire and 
markey that it was little more than a delaying tactic by the 
administration anxious to avoid any additional regulation of the 
markets 
they believe congress must get moving this spring before its 
members become preoccupied with the summer political conventions 
and their own reelection campaigns in the fall 
however the participation of brady on the side of proxmire and 
markey has made the debate more complicated than a dispute between 
democrats and republicans 
brady a former republican senator from new jersey is a close 
adviser to vice president george bush and is considered a leading 
candidate for treasury secretary should bush win the presidential 
election in november 
republican staffers are assisting democratic aides in drafting 
house legislation although it is unclear what parts republicans 
will ultimately support according to the markey aide 
in the senate bradys backing helped proxmire obtain more 
republican cosponsors than democratic five republicans and three 
democrats have signed on

the government sunday defended its ouster of a 
us diplomat and offered to back up charges that he meddled in 
local politics 
washington agreed with deep regret to a request from 
singapore saturday to withdraw e mason hank hendrickson a 
political attache 
the government also asked that hendrickson be reprimanded along 
with two unidentified senior state department officials who it said 
sanctioned his activities 
us embassy spokesman richard gong denied allegations made by 
the home affairs ministry that hendrickson interfered in 
singapores politics 
in meeting members of the political opposition which appears 
to be the basis of the singapore governments protest mr 
hendrickson was doing what american diplomats are expected to do in 
any country namely to keep in touch with a broad spectrum of 
individuals in order to report accurately developments in the 
country in question gong said 
in a statement sunday singapore said it would not 
capriciously or arbitrarily expel diplomats from singapore 
especially when the diplomat in question represents a friendly 
nation 
the assertion that hendrickson has not in any way acted 
improperly can only be a diplomatic fig leaf which the government 
is content to allow the united states to wear the statement said 
singapore contends that hendrickson met with opposition 
activists and urged them to contest upcoming elections 
prime minister lee kuan yews peoples action party is heavily 
favored to retain control of this island republic of 26 million 
people in elections that must be held by december 1989 
the party holds all but one of the 79 seats in parliament and 
there is no viable opposition capable of dislodging it 
hendrickson was trying to manipulate and instigate 
singaporeans in order to bring about a particular political 
outcome the government said 
his explusion was an unprecedented jolt to normally warm 
relations between the two countries lee long ago established close 
personal and political ties with washington and recently returned 
from private talks with president reagan and secretary of state 
george shultz 
the united states is the largest buyer of singapores exports 
and one of the biggest investors in this former british colony that 
gained full independence in 1965 
the diplomatic tiff is the latest in a chain of events that 
began with the arrests last year of 22 singaporeans accused of 
belonging to a clandestine communist network they were seized 
under the internal security act which allows for indefinate 
detention without trial 
all but one were freed by dec 26 most of them with 
restrictions on their movements 
among them was a lawyer patrick seong who allegedly was urged 
by hendrickson to fight the government 
seong was arrested again on april 19 along with eight of the 22 
former detainees that was less than 24 hours after the eight 
proclaimed their innocence and said they had been abused and 
coerced into making incriminating statements late last year 
on april 28 the home affairs ministry said the eight had sworn 
fresh declarations withdrawing their allegations and reconfirming 
their original guilt they are still behind bars and officials said 
an investigation continues 
besides seong 34 hendrickson was linked by the government to 
lawyer patrick seow 59 seow was arrested friday hours after he 
appeared in court seeking the release of two of those arrested 
april 19 
seow a former solictorgeneral and one time president of the 
law society is being held without charge under the internal 
security act for purposes of investigation into foreign 
interferences in singapores internal affairs 
trade and industry minister lee hsien loong said two distinct 
phases of the socalled political movement had become clear one 
was a marxist conspiracy involving the original 22 the other was 
separate action by foreign elements who made use of the detainees 
to meddle in domestic politics he said

might cause trouble and destabilize the government 
i know that some people were upset that he was not allowed to 
return mrs aquino said in her weekly radio program ask the 
president 
but i think the great majority are concerned that first of 
all we preserve whatever gains we have attained during the past 
two years she said and it is very necessary to preserve the 
stability that we have attained for the good of the entire 
country 
mrs aquino indicated she might allow a visit by any of marcos 
three children but she said the family must make a formal request 
to give the government time to prepare for security 
the president said no requests had been made 
officials have said the ban on marcos who lives in hawaii 
applied to all members of his immediate family immigration 
officials said they would be arrested if they entered the 
philippines 
there have been news reports that marcos son ferdinand jr 
planned to sneak into the country to represent his father at the 
funeral which hasnt been scheduled the former presidents other 
relatives denied the reports 
about 4000 marchers blew whistles shot off firecrackers and 
chanted marcos marcos along a sixmile route from a downtown 
park to a suburban roman catholic church where the body of josefa 
edralinmarcos lay in state 
mrs edralinmarcos died in a hospital wednesday at the age of 
95 just before she died marcos mother sent mrs aquino a 
deathbed wish that her son be allowed to return so she could see 
him one last time 
marcos fled to hawaii with his wife and three children during 
the february 1986 people power revolution that ended his 
20year rule and swept mrs aquino to the presidency 
he said in a statement wednesday that he will exhaust all 
possibilities to attend the funeral marcos younger brother 
pacifico and sister fortuna marcosbarba said they have not set 
a burial date because they hope mrs aquino will change her mind 
at the head of the march was an empty makeshift coffin draped 
with a philippine flag and a sign saying ninoy has died cory 
has risen marcos will come again 
ninoy was the nickname of mrs aquinos husband former sen 
benigno aquino jr who was assassinated aug 21 1983 as he 
stepped off a plane after returning to the philippines from three 
years voluntary exile in the united states the assassination 
triggered waves of protest that contributed to marcos downfall

an unusual latenight tornado slammed into a 
mobile home without warning killing a woman and her baby and

scattered damage in eastern nebraska 
twoinch hailstones broke windows in omaha and wind up to 60 mph 
pushed over trees and damaged other mobile homes 
the tornado touched down with no warning ripping the roof off a 
farmhouse and causing extensive damage to another house as well as 
the mobile home shortly before 11 pm saturday said sarpy county 
chief deputy lee polikov

steve byrd a meteorologist for the national weather service in 
omaha said sunday that the tornado touched down only for a few 
minutes he confirmed the funnel was not detected by radar 
it was the same thunderstorm that we followed with 1inch hail 
in the lincoln area but as far as showing a tornado that wasnt 
apparent through our radar detector he said we started 
detecting it in western douglas county but that was after it had 
touched down it apparently touched down and then went right back 
up 
small tornadoes that touch down only briefly are much more 
difficult to detect than large ones byrd said 
twoyearold lynn true was dead at the scene polikov said her 
mother joan true 29 died of head injuries early sunday at 
university of nebraska medical center in omaha said hospital 
spokesman tom oconnor 
dennis true 31 underwent surgery and was reported in critical 
but stable condition at midlands hospital in papillion

were reported trees were knocked down and dozens of small power 
outages were reported along with hail as large as 2 inches in 
diameter 
byrd said the hail broke windows at his office in north omaha 
weve got hailstones out here that are as big as hens eggs 
they are bigger than golf balls he said 
six to eight mobile homes in omaha were damaged including one 
that flipped on its side said larry hamilton sr assistant chief 
of the millard volunteer fire department 
wahoo fremont blair and columbus were hit by wind as strong as

president corazon aquinos son has 
been called to active military service and has been urged by his 
mother to accept the 30day draft to trim his waistline manila 
newspapers report 
the papers published sunday quoted benigno aquino iii as 
saying he received the notice last year but could not comply 
because of injuries sustained when mutinous troops attacked the 
presidential palace during the aug 28 coup attempt 
at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded in the 
attempt the most serious of half a dozen bids to topple mrs 
aquino since she came to power in february 1986 
the 28yearold aquino who works in an insurance firm said he 
received a second notice recently but was reluctant to accept 
because he feared the rigidity of military training the papers 
said so he sought advice from his mother who urged him to undergo 
military training if only to trim his waistline 
you have no wife and no children yet your belly is so big it 
makes you look like a father aquino quoted his mother as saying 
he said he has been assigned to a philippine air force unit with 
the rank of master sergeant but did not say when he will begin 
training

the army has serious problems in two of 
its frontline units because of continuing problems with weak bolts 
in some vehicles rep john dingell dmich said sunday 
the problem may be even more extensive than that because the two 
units received their bolts from the same depots that supply other 
army units both here and overseas said dingell chairman of the 
house energy and commerce committee 
dingell also heads the investigations subcommittee which held 
widely publicized hearings last august revealing problems of bolts 
and fasteners that werent as strong as expected 
the result is that wheel assemblies on some army vehicles such 
as trucks and the allpurpose humv may come lose according 
to testimony that will be presented monday to the investigations 
subcommittee during a followup hearing 
a subcommittee staff report said the problem fasteners were 
still found in large numbers in vehicles of the 7th infantry 
division at fort ord calif and the 9th regiment at fort carson 
colo 
tansill johnson a spokeswoman for the army material command 
which oversees the depots that supply the bolts admitted the 
service is still having problems 
were very concerned about this ms johnson said we have 
been remiss in not educating soldiers at the lowest level about 
using the right grade of bolts 
but she noted that in a series of tests weve found that many 
of the bolts are still effective even though they are substandard 
compared to contract specifications 
the subcommittee staff report noted that the vehicles of the 
units we visited contained a number of fasteners from foreign 
manufacturers whose bolts had previously been found substandard in 
numerous laboratory tests 
the combat units were experiencing severe fastener problems on 
their vehicles to the extent that the combat readiness of some 
units was affected it said 
because the fasteners were not as strong as they should have 
been some of them came lose in front wheel assemblies of the 
humv the investigators found this caused tire wear fastener 
failure and if not corrected loss of steering 
in a check of the 9th regiment half of the 102 humvs checked 
had loose fasteners and seven had been lost from service because 
the problem was so severe the subcommittee investigators found 
one officer got so frustrated with trying to get the right 
fasteners that he bought replacement bolts from the civilian 
economy with money from his own pocket in order to get the units 
vehicles ready by a stroke of luck he obtained domestic bolts at 
the local hardware store the report said 
part of the problem is that bolts are stored in a variety of 
bins and the containers arent always clearly marked according to 
ms johnson 
the subcommittee investigators agreed reporting that army 
maintenance personnel admitted that over 50 percent of their bins 
contained fasteners of unknown quality and complained that they 
were not receiving sufficient information to purge the suspect 
fasteners

a familiar jesse jackson line they take the early bus 
took on a new meaning for reporters traveling with the jackson 
presidential campaign in california last week 
jackson regularly makes the statement when referring to the 
working poor as a way to illustrate that many poor people are 
hardworking but still cant make a decent living 
on friday the press bus broke down en route from a jackson 
rally in san pedro to another in santa monica jacksons limousine 
motorcyle escort and the rest of the motorcade disappeared up the 
harbor freeway while the bus limped to the shoulder disabled by a 
transmission problem it was established later 
the staff called for another bus as the reporters fumed about 
being stranded an argument ensued among the driver secret service 
agent and a camera crew that wanted to get out and film the stalled 
bus 
the camera crew stayed inside the new bus arrived after about 
10 minutes and fought its way through freeway traffic to santa 
monica 
jackson meanwhile had arrived and saw another reporter who had 
been riding in a separate press van while her colleagues languished 
on the roadside 
when he asked how she got there so soon the reporter told 
jackson i took the early bus

jesse jackson has been getting a lot of mileage out of 
belittling george bush lately he has not had to look far for 
ammunition 
a recent favorite he quotes an april 30 new york times story in 
which bush was asked about reports that he has sought the 
resignation of embattled attorney gen edwin meese 
bush was quoted as replying i deny i have ever given my 
opinion to anybody 
the line gets a big laugh when jackson repeats it as he did in 
atlanta several thousand unionists attending a machinists 
convention last week 
as far as bush being in the drivers seat jackson came across 
another news story describing a bush photo opportunity for the 
press 
bush decided to drive a jeep as jackson tells it to improve 
his image of toughness so it would look like he was going to 
take america someplace 
at this point in the story jackson pauses for effect 
bush he says got in on the riders side

jesse jackson often talks about crossing lines of race sex and 
religion to find common ground among disparate groups 
but he had his work cut out for him in parma ohio a 
predominantly white bluecollar suburb of cleveland where racist 
attitudes were voiced openly by some 
an elderly woman said she could not support the black minister 
because id rather have our man in there one of ours you know 
what i mean when the reporter asked what she meant she replied 
id rather have a white person 
one elderly man told a reporter he did not think jackson would 
get much support around here because people dont want a black 
president it will turn the country around 
a union representative told another reporter that black people 
dont want to work very hard 
the comments were made in impromptu interviews with people 
attending a rowdy popcornandbeer fund raiser for for rep mary 
rose okar dohio last week 
the sea of white faces jackson found when he entered the union 
hall was not unusual for him around the country many whites 
attend his rallies and he has an active bluecollar following 
but this was not his crowd there was a constant din as he spoke 
and many having heard okar earlier walked out or lined up at the 
beer counter in the back during jacksons speech

for michael dukakis and george bush picking a 
vice presidential nominee is a key step in putting together the 
pieces of the electoral college puzzle as strategists try to fit 
the person to the political geography 
should dukakis pick a southern senator as his running mate to 
help the democrats win in the region this fall 
it just doesnt work when we go with two northerners on the 
ticket says democratic pollster peter hart 
should bush name california gov george deukmejian to the no 2 
spot on the gop ticket to grab the biggest states votes on nov 8 
the democrats must beat us in california to have a chance 
said republican consultant vincent breglio 
the pieces of the electoral college puzzle are states each 
offering a prize of electoral votes toward the goal of 270 the 
majority needed to win the white house 
the choice of a running mate always a tough decision is 
complicated in 1988 because ronald reagan has helped redraw the 
political contours of the country 
the once solidly democratic south is now viewed as one of 
bushs two strongholds along with the mountain states of the west 
with reagan not on the ticket california will be very 
competitive with a prize of 47 electoral votes 
the farm states of the midwest long gop bastions are ripe 
for democratic appeals after years of reagan agriculture policies 
that have left the region feeling battered 
the big industrial states of new york pennsylvania ohio 
michigan and the like are shaping up as very close battles 
dukakis the oddson favorite for the democratic presidential 
nomination must put his piece of the puzzle down first when the 
democratic national convention meets in atlanta in july then bush 
can look over the full opposition ticket before making a decision 
at the gop convention in new orleans in august 
historically vice presidential candidates arent the most 
important factor in an election win but they do count 
i think it gets you the state where the running mate is from 
but not much more said elaine kamarck a democratic activist and 
political scientist citing various studies 
nobody is going to carry a region as a vice presidential 
nominee argues robert beckel who managed walter mondales 1984 
campaign 
but that much wider impact is the keystone of the argument from 
those who are pushing a southerner for dukakiss running mate 
democrats making this argument say that the only times the party 
has won the white house since 1952 was with a southerner on board 
and a good showing in the region which sports 182 electoral votes 
dukakis needs a southern senator as a running mate not 
another governor said arkansas gov bill clinton on friday in 
saying he should not be the running mate 
sen sam nunn of georgia is the prime candidate under this 
scenario since he is a conservative democrat and chairman of the 
senate armed services committee but others mentioned as well are 
former presidential hopeful sen albert gore jr of tennessee sen 
dale bumpers of arkansas sen bob graham of florida and sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas 
is sam nunn going to bring us the rest of the south asked 
democratic pollster mark mellman hes not very well known 
outside of georgia of course he will make an appeal but he 
will be overshadowed by the top of the ticket 
a nonsoutherner who could have appeal in the south is sen john 
glenn of ohio whose military background exastronaut status and 
moderate views would have appeal in the region and perhaps as 
importantly glenn is popular in his home state with its 23 
electoral votes 
while the south is important almost everyone agrees that the 
west coast is critical 
california is the key said democratic consultant john 
russonello 
california is not a republican anchor its very much up for 
grabs said gop pollster richard wirthlin 
the states 47 electoral votes are the biggest prize in the 
general election almost onefifth of the majority needed 
deukmejian the states popular governor and a bush backer has 
always been high on the lists of possible gop nominees but there 
is a major drawback if deukmejian won the vice presidency he 
would have to turn the governors chair over to a democrat 
it is impossible said gop consultant lance tarrance 
because of his sincere and intense interest in running the state 
of california 
but the gop choice will also be shaped by the democratic moves 
a southern choice by the democrats would open up the 
opportunity to do some cherrypicking in the midwest explains 
wirthlin former pennsylvania gov dick thornburgh and illinois 
gov jim thompson are two names mentioned 
in contrast a midwestern choice by the opposition might send 
the gop rushing to deukmejian 
but then there is rep jack kemp of new york the former gop 
presidential hopeful with strong california ties and a message of 
economic optimism that tarrance said would be appealing in the 
midwest 
former tennessee gov lamar alexander is the most often 
mentioned southerner among the republicans if bush decided to 
shore up his base there sen alan simpson of wyoming gets 
mentioned as a possible western candidate 
a completely different approach for the republicans would be to 
choose a woman for the no 2 spot as the democrats did with 
geraldine ferraro in 1984 
while choosing former transportation secretary elizabeth dole 
sen nancy kassebaum of kansas or former united nations ambassador 
jeane kirkpatrick would have impact in their home states the 
larger goal would be to narrow the gender gap of negative 
womens opinions that has hurt the gop since 1980

the animosity between saudi arabia and 
iran that has led to their recent diplomatic split is rooted in a 
centuriesold schism in the moslem world between the sunni and 
shiite sects 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 1979 islamic revolution in iran 
which is predominantly shiite dragged the religious feud into the 
20th century sparking new fears among the conservative 
sunnidominated persian gulf states and other arab countries 
the revolutions triumph in toppling the prowestern shah 
mohammed reza pahlavi also fueled islamic fervor among 
fundamentalist sunnis 
that along with the vigorous shiite challenge has ignited 
violence from socialist syria to monarchist morocco in the last 
decade 
the islamic resurgence has brought a religious intensity not 
witnessed since the middle ages and has perplexed and alarmed the 
west 
while the saudis cited terrorism and threats for breaking 
relations with tehran on april 27 they mainly were seeking to head 
off iranianinspired violence in the holy city of mecca in this 
years annual haj or pilgrimage 
more than 400 pilgrims 275 of them iranians were killed in 
rioting in mecca last year that shocked the moslem world iran 
vowed revenge and khomeini called for the overthrow of saudi 
arabias royal family 
the saudis want to avoid a repetition of the violence this year 
by getting moslem countries to scale down the number of pilgrims 
they send iran asked to trim its contingent of the usual 150000 
by about onethird refuses 
instead iran has revived calls for an islamic crusade against 
saudi arabia and stripping the royal family of custodianship of 
islams holiest shrines in mecca prophet mohammeds birthplace 
and in medina where he is buried 
the guardianship of these holy sites is one of the underpinnings 
of the saudi monarchy that gives it political legitimacy in the 
eyes of most moslems 
the deepening hostility between iran and saudi arabia has been 
exacerbated by the 7yearold iraniraq war in which the saudis 
have supported arab iraq against persian iran 
the arabs and persians separated by language and culture have 
been religious rivals since the death of mohammed the founder of 
islam in 632 ad 
the sunnis who make up more than 90 percent of the worlds 850 
million moslems revere mohammed as second only to god and view abu 
bakr the prophets fatherinlaw and the man who became islams 
first caliph as his rightful successor 
the mystical shiites consider mohammeds cousin and soninlaw 
ali the fourth caliph and 11 of his descendants to be the true 
heirs of the faith they revere all 12 as imams or saints and 
believe the 12th imam mehdi will return like a messiah to bring 
justice to the world 
ali was assassinated in 661 amid a power struggle by two 
factions over who would lead the moslem world following mohammeds 
death 
alis death confirmed the sunni umayyad dynasty in power as the 
caliphs or successors of the prophet alis descendants remained 
in perpetual revolt claiming to be the true caliphate and refusing 
to accept orthodox teachings espoused by the sunnis 
alis son hussein led one rebellion and was massacred with his 
handful of outnumbered followers in the battle of karbala in what 
is now iraq in 680 
ever since the minority shiites were considered heretics only 
in iran where for political motives a 16th century shah embraced 
shiitism as the established creed did the downtrodden sect 
flourish 
every year when they mark the death of hussein militant 
shiites flagellate themselves with chains and swords in a 
passionate celebration of the martyr acts which sunnis regard as 
demeaning 
for khomeini and his followers their revolution was the dawn of 
a new age of islamic fundamentalism as a powerful force in the 
world the time of reckoning after 1300 years of subjugation 
the revival stems in part from moslems rebelling against the 
western influence that colonialism brought and oil wealth 
intensified in the last two decades transforming what were feudal 
societies and eroding cultural values in this vacuum 
fundamentalism has taken root 
khomeinis belief that iran is the beacon for a fundamentalist 
revival that will sweep the world and his drive to export the 
revolution has caused mayhem among the monarchies of the persian 
gulf who believe themselves vulnerable 
the iraniraq war has only heightened the passions 
tiny kuwait which is closest to the war zone and under constant 
threat from iran has cracked down hard on its shiite militants 
after a chain of terrorist attacks including the april 5 hijacking 
of a kuwaiti jetliner by shiite extremists on sunday the 
newspaper alanbaa called for the government to deport shiite 
moslems who show allegiance to iran 
shiites comprise about onefourth of kuwaits 19 million 
population in bahrain where sunnis rule the shiites form about 
70 percent of the population 
seven years ago bahraini authorities foiled what apparently was 
a shiite plot aimed at assassinating the ruler sheik isa bin 
sulman alkhalifa 
fundamentalism inspired by khomeinis revolution has reared up 
further afield 
tunisia broke off relations with tehran last year alleging iran 
was seeking to foster an islamic rebellion 
fundamentalists assassinated president anwar sadat of egypt in 
1980 and remain politically active there 
syrian president hafez assad crushed a rebellion by the 
fundamentalist moslem brotherhood in the city of hama in 1982 
slaughtering as many as 30000 people and razing much of the city 
saudi arabias decision to sever relations with tehran has 
increased the polarization between irans shiite zealots and the 
arabs that the iraniraq war has brought 
but the saudis also were throwing down the gauntlet to their 
shiite rivals only a few weeks before the haj is due to start and 
that could have dangerous consequences in their feud

a polish official responding to reagan 
administration criticism of a crackdown on labor unrest denied 
sunday that strikers were beaten and said a government that fired 
its air traffic controllers should know the difference between a 
legal and an illegal strike 
lt col wieslaw gornicki polish government political adviser 
denied news reports and us government allegations of violence 
against striking workers at a krakow steel mill and accused the 
news media of exaggerating and inflaming conditions in poland 
the strike was crushed but nobody was beaten gornicki said 
in an interview from warsaw on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley 
if it all were true what your news media is reporting we 
would have a general strike a nationwide strike of 10 days or 
perhaps three months gornicki said at least five strikes have

soviet police on sunday tried to interrupt 
meetings of scores of dissidents seeking to challenge the supremacy 
of the communist party and detained 20 people as they left one of 
the gatherings dissidents said 
editors of 30 nonofficial journals hoping to break the 
government monopoly on publishing also met in moscow to formalize 
their cooperation by establishing the independent publications club 
on saturday 148 people attended an initial meeting to form an 
alternative political party called the democratic union on sunday 
they broke into groups to discuss the partys political platform 
and socioeconomic and organizational questions 
yevgeniya debryanskaya who hosted the meeting about the groups 
political platform said police arrived at her north moscow 
apartment in about 30 cars sunday evening and tried to enter 
about 50 people were jammed in ms debryanskayas living room 
thrashing out the groups political goals 
ms debryanskaya said the group refused to let officers in but 
20 people were detained as they left she said in a telephone 
interview that she did not know what happened to them but noted 
that authorities often hold people for several hours and then 
release them 
smaller groups discussed the partys organization and 
socioeconomic policies at two other moscow apartments 
igor tsarkov leader of the organizational meeting said a 
moscow city official accompanied by police arrived at the meeting 
and asked that the group of 15 disband 
police asked to check their documents but the participants 
refused and police eventually left tsarkov said 
valentin eliseyedko head of the group on socioeconomic 
problems said police also visited that meeting and checked 
documents but otherwise did not interfere 
ms debryanskaya said in an interview earlier sunday that a 
committee of 15 people had drafted political principles calling for 
multiparty parliamentary democracy 
a new constitution replacing the current document that makes 
the communist party the leading and guiding force of soviet 
society 
independent trade unions and 
withdrawal of soviet soldiers from eastern european countries 
and from the western ukraine and the baltic states which ms 
debryanskaya said the group considers to be under soviet occupation 
the meetings of the democratic union and the independent 
publishers group were were notable for the number of people they 
drew to moscow authorities have not broken up previous efforts to 
hold dissident conferences but they have closed conference 
facilities and prevented some people from traveling to them 
many dissident groups and independent publications have sprung 
up since hundreds of political prisoners were freed in 1987 
authorities in the past have crushed efforts to form an 
opposition to the communist party and despite his reform effort 
mikhail s gorbachev has given no indication the party will 
tolerate any opposition 
ms debryanskaya said gorbachev will allow the group to exist if 
he is serious about reforms arguments and disagreements are 
normal in society she said 
but any such group also faces enormous difficulties in a vast 
country where the government controls printing facilities and 
authorities can detain or intimidate dissidents and disrupt mail 
and telephone calls 
on saturday dissident sources said police surrounded the 
apartment building across the street from the government offices of 
the russian republic where the first meeting was held but did not 
break it up 
ms debryanskaya said her group will make a formal declaration 
seeking official recognition of the democratic union and transmit 
it to moscow city authorities 
she has been active in a group supporting greater trust between 
east and west and a second group calling itself democracy and 
humanism 
former political prisoners sergei grigoryants and lev timofeyev 
and other publishers of independent journals from moscow 
leningrad riga lvov pskov and kuybyshev decided at their weekend 
gatherings to form a library to preserve and help disseminate their 
publications 
thirty publications emphasizing such topics as political 
commentary religion and womens issues were represented 
participants said a similar meeting was held in leningrad last 
fall and the group agreed to hold another large conference in 
moscow in october 
some of the publications have sought official approval but none 
has been given 
participants in the editors gathering said police checked 
documents of people who arrived at the south moscow apartment on 
saturday but no police or plainclothes officers were visible

the weekend seizure of a 25 million yacht after 
less than onetenth of an ounce of marijuana was found on board is 
a headlinegrabbing scare tactic that violates common sense a 
civil libertarian said sunday 
but the us coast guards seizure of boats like the 133foot 
ark royal was meant to make an impact 
this new policy should be taken as fair warning to anyone who 
is using or transporting any detectable amount of drugs on our 
waterways transportation secretary jim burnley said when he 
announced the zero tolerance policy here two weeks ago 
but mary coombs a member of the miami chapter of the american 
civil liberties union said the policy sets a dangerous precedent 
to take somebodys property from them for something they 
probably couldnt control is excessive she said sunday 
the ark royal registered in delaware and operated only by a 
crew of six employees was boarded saturday in international waters 
in the yucatan channel between mexico and cuba neither its 
registered owner michael j rogerson described by the coast guard 
as the president and chief shareholder of tomima corp nor any 
passengers were on board said coast guard lt john felker 
a boarding party from the cutter tampa noticed a tiny bit of 
marijuana residue in a trash can during a friendly document check 
the resulting search revealed a little marijuana tucked in the 
dresser of a stateroom coast guard spokesman luis diaz said 
at this point the person who owned the contraband has not come 
forward felker said the crew will probably be released 
uncharged when they arrive at the key west coast guard station 
expected during the night he said the yacht was to be impounded 
we have been focusing all of our efforts in recent years on 
just the big smugglers but drugs are a twoway street diaz 
said this is the time were making the users pay it really has 
to hurt to see a luxury yacht taken away for what basically amounts 
to one joint 
asked if it didnt seem harsh to take away the boat under those 
circumstances felker said zero tolerance means exactly that 
without regards to the size of the vessel or of value of the 
vessel 
a usflagged vessel is us territory anywhere in the world 
we have authority to enforce us laws over that vessel anywhere in 
the world except in the territorial seas of a foreign state even 
then we may be granted authority by that foreign state felker 
said 
the reagan administration is stretching the law with its seizure 
policy said ms coombs 
congress may have passed a law that permits confiscation of 
property used in drug trafficking but thats not the same as 
saying congress had in mind that they would have a zero tolerance 
policy she said 
it violates a sense of proportionality ms coombs said 
its putting people at enormous risk with no very effective way 
of protecting themselves and as a civil libertarian i am troubled 
by that kind of policy 
my guess is the coast guard is going to fight pretty hard on 
this one she said its going to have enormous symbolic 
value 
the previously mostexpensive vessel confiscated under the 
program was a 300000 yacht seized off lake worth said diaz 
efforts to reach rogerson for comment sunday were unsuccessful 
there was no listing under that name in delaware or miami there 
was a person with that name in philadelphia but he had an unlisted 
number efforts to find a listing for a tomima corp were also 
unsuccessful

protesters denouncing the roman catholic churchs 
hypocrisy of honoring women on mothers day while denying them 
the priesthood staged a peaceful vigil sunday outside holy name 
cathedral 
a smaller group of demonstrators some carrying pictures of pope 
john paul ii gathered to reinforce church teachings that women 
cannot be priests 
about 40 members and supporters of a group called chicago 
catholic women stood outside the cathedral home pulpit of cardinal 
joseph bernardin holding signs including one which said we want 
a church for our daughters 
the demonstrators who included a handful of men passed out 
fliers urging parishioners to boycott regular services and to 
attend an alternate service later at a north side womens center 
theres something to tradition said gerry gorman 35 who 
was carrying her 10monthold son gabriel theres also 
something to ending an unjust system 
another demonstrator was debra graves 32 of woodridge who 
said she has a masters degree in divinity from harvard and would 
likely go into the priesthood if allowed 
im ready she said my church is not 
hundreds of parishioners and visitors attended the morning 
mothers day mass inside holy name while the demonstrators stood 
outside 
nanci mayhoefer 43 of chicago was among about 10 demonstrators 
against ordination of women 
tradition is a very strong part of our church mrs 
mayhoefer said in performing part of the church service the 
priest takes the place of christ and a woman cant play that 
role she said 
ms gorman of chicago said the vigil was planned because the 
issue of women and the church is tearing the church apart and 
was not given serious consideration by bishops who attended last 
falls synod on the laity at the vatican 
her groups flier said the church shows hypocrisy on 
mothers day 
this is the day on which the institutional church honors its 
women it said by our absence we hope to demonstrate our 
frustration with such tokenism 
marie knoll a spokeswoman for the archdiocese of chicago 
issued a statement on the issue before sundays protest 
the recent pastoral letter by the us bishops responding to 
the concerns of women clearly acknowledges that more needs to be 
done to recognize and incorporate the insights and talents of women 
as partners in the church she said 
irene mccartin 42 a parishioner from olympia fields seemed to 
agree with the archdiocese view 
for some families its really one time to get together she 
said of mothers day the demonstration she said takes away 
from it 
but another parishioner barbara malewicki 46 of lansing was 
not offended i think theres merit in what they have to say and 
it should be talked about not dismissed she said

kristen knouse doesnt think theres 
anything special about a blind person riding a horse in a national 
college equestrian competition but she had to fight for a chance 
to prove that 
the blind rutgers university student has been riding horses 
using her sense of hearing to guide her since she was 10 years old 
its easy i can hear the horses feet echo off the rail 
miss knouse 19 said in a telephone interview sunday from her 
hotel room in laurinburg site of sundays 15th intercollegiate 
national championship horse show 
later in the day she placed fourth out of 12 riders in the 
walktrot equitation class 
a day earlier the freshman persuaded organizers to reverse 
their earlier decision and let her compete 
although she qualified for the competition by winning a regional 
collegiate contest last month in horsham pa organizers last week 
disqualified her from the national show saying a blind rider could 
be dangerous to other riders 
the ruling surprised miss knouse who has competed for two 
semesters on the rutgers equestrian team 
you see ive never been kept out of anything before not 
even when i was a kid she said 
she competes in a type of riding called hunt seat in which 
riders in traditional englishstyle attire demonstrate various 
gaits as they go around the show ring and are judged on their form 
she said shes tried her hand at jumping but only in practice 
sessions 
the disqualification also surprised her parents and teammates on 
the rutgers equestrian squad who accompanied her to north carolina 
on friday to protest the ruling 
the north carolina branch of american civil liberties union also 
came to her aid calling the disqualification discriminatory 
an attorney for the intercollegiate horse show association said 
the initial decision to disqualify miss knouse was based primarily 
on insurance concerns and the safety of other riders 
discrimination is not at issue said attorney john maccrate 
about 260 riders from colleges around the united states competed 
saturday and sunday in the event at st andrews presbyterian 
college 
miss knouse from medford nj said she usually competes with 
spotters people posted around the horse show ring to warn her 
of corners and obstacles 
show officials ruled thursday that the spotters violated 
competition rules while miss knouses riding without them might 
endanger other riders 
but on saturday after putting miss knouse and her mount through 
paces in a private corral at the horse show farm the show 
officials relented 
they decided to let a friend of miss krouse run alongside her 
while she rode in the show ring in the walktrot class but without 
any verbal communication between horsewoman and helper 
she certainly is comfortable on a horse it went very very 
smoothly yesterday said shelby french who owns the farm where 
the show was held and coaches the equestrian team at st andrews 
miss knouse who has been blind since birth said she mounted 
her first horse at age 10 at a riding academy near her home she 
quickly adjusted to the different gaits while her sense of hearing 
and the riding instructor helped her guide the animal 
later she practiced on the family horse rhannon riding at 
home in a large circle at the end of a long rope held by her father 
i know rhannons gaits really well she said but ive 
ridden strange horses so many times 
william simpson an attorney for the aclu in north carolina 
said he was glad show officials finally recognized miss knouses 
rights 
at first like most people they just didnt see how she could 
do it simpson said but i think a fair evaluation with a 
sensitivity to her efforts to overcome her blindness was all she 
ever asked for

donald t regan former white house chief of 
staff on sunday portrayed president reagan as a hesitant and 
unassertive chief executive controlled by a scheming 
imageconscious first lady who depended heavily upon an 
astrologers stargazing predictions 
regan offered a sometimes bitter account of his stormy days at 
the white house in a memoir for the record from wall street to 
washington published by harcourt brace jovanovich and scheduled 
to go on sale in bookstores on monday 
virtually ever major move and decision the reagans made during 
my time as white house chief of staff was cleared in advance with a 
woman in san francisco who drew up horoscopes to make certain that 
the planets were in a favorable alignments for the enterprise 
regan wrote 
he did not identify the woman saying nancy reagan referred to 
her only as friend but time magazine which carried excerpts 
of the book in its new issue said she is nob hill socialite 
joan quigley sixtyish a vassar graduate who has written three 
books on astrology 
ms quigley a wealthy republican whose specialty is politics 
is a frequent guest on the merv griffin show she has been 
practicing astrology since the 1960s and has written several books 
on the subject 
reached by the san francisco chronicle last week on vacation in 
paris she acknowledged she has known the reagans for years but 
refused to comment on whether they had ever been her clients 
i never say who my clients are never it is very 
confidential she said 
asked if it would be wrong to say she was the reagans 
astrologer she said i wont comment on that i cant comment 
the reagans had no comment sunday afternoon when they alighted 
from the helicopter that brought them from camp david md where 
they had spent the weekend reagan pointed to his ear indicating 
he could not hear questions shouted at him by reporters mrs 
reagan appeared cool and unsmiling but said nothing 
on friday however reagan expressed irritation about regans 
book the latest in a series of kiss and tell books about 
reagans presidency hes chosen to attack my wife and i dont 
look kindly upon that at all reagan said 
for a time regan says he was kept in the dark about mrs 
reagans secret closely held by a handful of aides since reagans 
days as the governor of california 
but after repeated clashes with the first lady over schedules 
longtime reagan aide michael deaver told the chief of staff about 
the woman and advised regan to humor the first lady he said 
at one point i kept a colorcoded calendar on my desk 
numerals highlighted in green ink for good days red for bad 
days yellow for iffy days as an aid to remembering when it was 
propitious to move the president of the united states from one 
place to another or schedule him to speak in public or commence 
negotiations with a foreign power regan wrote 
mrs reagan liked to chat with the woman every saturday from 
camp david he said the advice from the soothsayer coupled with a 
concern by nancy reagan for the presidents health that regan 
described as excessive caused particular problems when the 
irancontra scandal broke and prostate surgery required a time of 
recuperation the former chief of staff recalled 
regan described mrs reagan as presiding over a shadowy 
distaff presidency and using adroit guerrilla actions to 
achieve goals in a genuine belief that she was the best judge of 
her husbands interests 
mrs reagan regarded herself as the presidents alter ego not 
only in the conjugal but also in the political and official 
dimensions as if the office that had been bestowed upon her 
husband by the people somehow fell into the category of worldly 
goods covered by the marriage vows he wrote 
the presidents view of the situation was never discussed 
he said the fact that he permitted it to exist and that he 
never reversed any of the situations created by his wifes 
intervention was regarded as sufficient evidence that he was 
willing to tolerate the state of affairs 
regan pressed the first lady to allow the president to speak out 
on the irancontra affair telling her we need a press 
conference public appearances speeches 
a full month after the presidents release from the hospital 
his schedule was still a dead letter because mrs reagans friend 
had not provided a list of auspicious days the whole month 
appeared inauspicious for the president regan wrote 
after consulting with her friend the first lady provided 
some possible dates regan wrote but her advice was not always 
heeded regan wrote that mrs reagan appeared to want to delay the 
presidents july 1985 surgery for suspected cancer of the colon 
because of her astrological concerns but the president overruled 
any delay 
regan quoted the president saying why wait do the test and 
go ahead with the operation 
but mrs reagans influence hardly stopped at such lesser 
matters as scheduling trips or speeches regan said in his 
account she was the one who decreed that vice president george 
bush and national security adviser robert mcfarlane be barred from 
reagans hospital bed for days following his cancer surgery 
and the presidents longtime friendship with cia director 
william j casey did not prevent the first lady from pressing for 
his ouster even as he lay recuperating from brain cancer surgery 
at christmastime 1986 regan contended in one of his many 
descriptions of their telephone conversations 
mrs reagan who had already shown signs of irritability now 
became angry youre more interested in protecting bill casey 
than in protecting ronnie she cried hes got to go he cant do 
his job hes an embarrassment to ronnie he should be out 
regan quoted the first lady as insisting 
and reagan asserted the first lady not only chose the speech 
writer for such vital addresses as the state of the union but also 
heavily edited them 
i dont give a damn about the righttolifers he quotes 
mrs reagan as saying when she demanded that passages referring to 
abortion be deleted 
regan contended he was ousted by an effort organized at the 
hands of mrs reagan and several of her close associates and he 
barely has a kind word for the first lady in the 379page book 
regan portrayed reagan as a president who laid down no rules 
and articulated no mission at the same time he told of 
instances in which reagan held lengthy discussions with aides on 
complicated legislation bills or administration efforts to push 
budget cuts through capitol hill 
but mrs reagan emerged in the book as regans foremost target 
he paints her as an easily irritated constant telephone 
presence who constantly meddled in administration affairs

the israeli supreme court on sunday temporarily 
blocked the deportation of an arabamerican advocate of civil 
disobedience and gave the government three days to explain its 
expulsion order 
in the occupied gaza strip protests erupted over army orders 
that 300000 palestinians obtain new identity cards 
an israeli cabinet member called for legislation limiting the 
defense ministers powers to order military actions the move came 
after last weeks israeli incursion into lebanon in which three 
israeli soldiers died 
supreme court justice shoshana netanyahu delayed for three days 
the deportation order against mubarak awad who filed his appeal 
sunday he was to have been deported at midnight 
ms netanyahu ordered the government to explain its order and 
also scheduled a hearing monday on a request that awad be released 
from jail court spokesman shmaryahu cohen said 
awad has been on a hunger strike since his arrest thursday in a 
statement he said he was defending the right of all 
jerusalemites to continue to live peacefully in their homeland 
regardless of their opinions 
for prime minister yitzhak shamir to say that i a 
christian will be forever prevented from returning to my city of 
jerusalem to pray in my holy places is totally unacceptable he 
said 
awads wife nancy nye read the statement to reporters 
israel radio said secretary of state george p shultz sent 
shamir a personal message protesting the deportation order against 
awad a proponent of nonviolent resistance to israels 21year 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the us state department had no immediate comment on the 
report and a spokesman for shamir said the prime minister had not 
received shultzs message 
the israeli government has accused awad 44 of inciting 
violence during the 5monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories by un count 184 palestinians and two 
israelis have been killed since the violence began dec 8 
on friday after issuing the deportation order the government 
alleged awad helped prepare leaflets urging youths to throw 
firebombs and stones 
jonathan kuttab a lawyer for awad said the appeal was based 
primarily on the inherent right of jerusalemites palestinian 
arabs to continue to reside in arab east jerusalem 
the jerusalemborn awad left for the united states in 1968 and 
returned in 1985 to found the palestinian center for the study of 
nonviolence 
the government refused to renew his israeliissued residence 
permit last august in november the government also rejected his 
plea for the renewal of a tourist visa 
israel radio said the palestine liberation organization has 
pressured awad not to appeal the deportation because such a move 
would imply acceptance of israeli rule 
when asked about the report kuttab said only that the existence 
of differing opinions in the palestinian community was well known 
demonstrations broke out in at least six towns and refugee camps 
in the gaza strip against military orders that residents apply for 
new id cards 
the military has seized cards to force residents to pay back 
taxes utility bills and other government fees nonpayment of 
taxes and other fees is a major tactic in the uprising 
palestinians in the occupied territories are required to carry 
the cards at all times they are frequently stopped by soldiers and 
asked to show them and are subject to arrest if caught without a 
card 
in the beach refugee camp police fired tear gas and rubber 
bullets to disperse protesters at least 23 people were treated at 
the camps un clinic and nearby al shifa hospital for injuries 
and the effects of tear gas doctors said 
a military source denied the new rules were designed to force 
people to pay the outstanding bills 
its time to replace the id cards because there are many old 
ones torn ones without pictures you cannot see exactly whats 
written on them said the source who spoke on condtion of 
anonymity 
the source said cards would only be renewed in gaza not in the 
west bank he did not elaborate 
scattered palestinian protests were reported in the west bank 
arab reporters said police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to 
disperse about 200 arabs in ramallah no injuries were reported 
during sundays regular cabinet meeting energy minister moshe 
shahal of the labor party proposed draft legislation aimed at 
limiting the defense ministers powers to decide on military 
operations without consulting the 24member cabinet 
cabinet members have complained that defense minister yitzhak 
rabin also a labor member did not inform them of the scope of the 
armys lebanon action last week 
rabin and several other cabinet members defended the action 
saying it stayed within the framework of defending israels 
northern border

banks prepared to allow customers to make limited withdrawals from 
their accounts monday for the first time in more than nine weeks 
a government order shut down banks on march 3 following a run on 
savings by panicky depositors and the imposition of us economic 
sanctions in an effort to force gen manuel antonio noriega to 
resign as commander of the defense forces 
the sanctions including the freezing of an estimated 50 
million of government funds in us accounts helped produce a 
severe cash shortage in panama which uses the us dollar as its 
currency 
after rejecting earlier government orders to resume operations 
with restrictions some financial institutions agreed to reopen on 
april 18 to accept deposits a week later the government allowed 
them to expand transactions but cash withdrawals were still barred 
meanwhile the government refused to allow panamanian lawyer 
rogelio cruz to reenter the country he had recently arranged bail 
for some members of the opposition national civic crusade 
cruz wife marcela de cruz said her husband was put on a plane 
leaving panama when he tried to return saturday from costa rica 
she said cruz was taken to a security office and told absolutely 
nothing before he was expelled 
some civic crusade leaders have been hiding for weeks after 
security forces raided their offices and homes 
several opposition leaders have been refused reentry or 
expelled during the 11monthlong political crisis and then allowed 
to return later 
panamanians unable to cash their paychecks have conducted 
business on a barter or cashonly basis since the closing of the 
banks public employees have received government checks in small 
denominations which they can use to buy groceries or pay utility 
bills 
supermarkets that take the checks use them to pay utility bills 
and taxes 
bankers and government officials agreed after a series of 
negotiations to resume limited withdrawals beginning monday 
some bankers said the compromise was little more than an attempt 
to produce the image of business as usual since the cash crisis has 
not eased 
the banks will be open but they will not be open said juan 
ramon felliu president of the industrialists union of panama 
rules issued by the governments national banking commission 
limit the amount panamanians will be able to withdraw from checking 
accounts to 25 percent of the balance on march 3 with a maximum of 
10000 money deposited after april 18 is to be free of 
restrictions 
withdrawals from savings accounts are to be limited to 50 
beginning a month after the reopening withdrawals of interest are 
unrestricted 
all withdrawals are subject to the availability of cash at the 
individual bank 
the governments caja de ahorro bank announced it would not cash 
checks for the time being the national bank of panama which 
normally honors government checks also said it would not pay out 
cash 
the panamana banking association which represents 93 of the 117 
banks most of them foreign previously insisted its members would 
not resume full services unless the government could assure an 
adequate supply of us dollars to back normal customer and 
commercial transactions 
some bankers said they would abide by the agreement but insisted 
that conditions still did not exist for fullservice operations 
if that is their thinking they are part of the aggression 
against panama noriega said on friday 
two federal grand juries in florida indicted the general in 
february on drug trafficking charges noriega has denied the 
charges and said they are politically motivated 
panamas crisis worsened after noriega who controls the 
civilian government had the legislature depose president eric 
arturo delvalle on feb 26 the day after delvalle tried to fire 
the general as commander of the 15000member defense forces 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as president and 
imposed the sanctions

a man accused in 16 deaths including the 
christmastime slaughter of 14 relatives will go to trial first for 
the two killings outside his family 
r gene simmons 47 a retired air force master sergeant is 
charged with two counts of capital murder in the dec 28 shooting 
spree in russellville in which six people were shot by a gunman 
wielding two 22 caliber pistols two of the victims died 
in his trial which begins monday simmons could be sentenced to 
die or to life in prison without parole if convicted of either 
count of capital murder he also will be tried on five counts of 
attempted capital murder and one of kidnapping 
the defense will ask circuit judge john patterson to dismiss the 
attempted capital murder counts on grounds that under arkansas 
law they are superseded by the capital murder counts according to 
defense attorney john harris 
following the shooting spree 14 members of simmons family were 
found slaughtered charges from the slaying of the family are to be 
tried later 
the 16 deaths made it one of the worst mass slayings in american 
history 
the case was moved to ozark after the defense argued that there 
had been so much pretrial publicity that it would be difficult to 
get an unprejudiced jury in russellville 47 miles west of here 
harris declined to say whether simmons would testify 
the attorney said sunday that he had no plans at this time 
to raise insanity as a defense tests on simmons found no evidence 
of a problem such as a brain tumor that could have affected his 
behavior 
after his arrest simmons was was found by doctors to be legally 
sane and thus able to stand trial 
moments before he surrendered dec 28 police said the gunman 
told his hostage ive gotten everybody who wanted to hurt me 
ive come to do what i wanted to do its all over now 
simmons will be on trial for the deaths of kathy c kendrick 
24 who police say once spurned simmons romantic advances and of 
james d chaffin 33 who police say was a chance victim 
miss kendrick was shot in the head at a russellville law office 
where she was a legal secretary chaffin was slain at an oil 
company where the gunman wounded the oil company owner 
to be tried later are two capital murder charges one accusing 
simmons of killing seven relatives the other accusing him of 
killing seven other relatives there are two groups of seven 
because authorities believe the killings took place at different 
times 
after simmons was arrested sheriffs deputies found the bodies 
of five relatives including two of his children and their spouses 
four of the victims had been shot and the other victim simmons 
11yearold granddaughter had been strangled they apparently died 
after they arrived for a christmas season family gathering police 
said 
the next day police dug into a shallow kerosenesoaked grave 
and found seven bodies including those of simmons other children 
and his wife becky she had told family members in a letter i am 
a prisoner here and the kids too 
police said that some of these victims had been shot others 
strangled apparently before christmas gift packages were 
unopened beneath the christmas tree 
police also found the bodies of two infant boys in garbage sacks 
in the trunks of abandoned cars on simmons property they were 
strangled 
the gun that killed miss kendrick and chaffin had been used to 
kill some of simmons relatives state ballistics experts said

scientists from battelle memorial 
institute are developing a robot that will test clothing for the 
army by crawling panting and even sweating 
the lifesized robot nicknamed manny is being made by battelle 
scientists in richland wash so the army can see how protective 
clothing worn by troops reacts to harsh conditions such as heat 
cold high humidity smoke fire and chemical attack development 
costs have been about 2 million 
gregory koller spokesman for the columbusbased institute said 
manny is scheduled for delivery to the armys dugway proving ground 
in utah this fall 
david w bennett the battelle engineer who developed the robot 
said manny has 40 articulated joints that allow movement and stress 
testing of the clothing the robot can walk bend over squat drop 
to all fours and crawl 
robot testing gives more precise information on body and 
clothing stress than is possible with humans bennett said 
mannys trials will be limited to the laboratory at dugway 
because the robot is connected by an electronic cord to a computer 
the robots artificial skin will be sensitive to changes in 
temperature or exposure to chemicals during exertion breath will 
be simulated by expansion and contraction of the chest and the 
exhalation of moist air 
perspiration is simulated by the release of water from small 
tubes on the robots body 
the robot has to breathe and perspire to simulate the buildup of 
moisture between the clothing and the skin 
since manny exudes pure water he has no body odor said 
bennett actually he smells pretty good so far he said

regan said he told vice president george bush about mrs 
reagans dependence on astrological advice while they were 
discussing the presidents schedule just after the tower commission 
report was issued in february 1987 
he says bush listened with surprise and consternation on 
his face and exclaimed good god i had no idea 
regan portrayed reagan as a reluctant decisionmaker 
he listened encouraged deferred he wrote but it was a 
rare meeting in which he made a decision or issued orders 
never did he issue a direct order although i at least 
sometimes devoutly wished that he would regan added he 
listened acquiesced played his role and waited for the next act 
to be written 
in the four years that i served as secretary of the treasury 
i never saw president reagan alone and never discussed economic 
philosophy alone and never discussed economic philosophy or fiscal 
and monetary policy with him man to man 
from first day to last at treasury i was flying by the seat 
of my pants the president never told me what he believed or what 
he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics i had to figure 
these things out like any other american by studying his speeches 
and reading the newspapers 
while critical of the presidents handsoff style regan also 
commented that such a laidback presidency created an atmosphere 
of confidence and political dynamism 
regan stressed that in the presidents mind there was never a 
swap of arms for hostages at the time the united states was sending 
weapons to tehran 
regan recalled that mcfarlane first mentioned establishing ties 
with iran during a fateful july 18 1985 meeting with reagan 
following his colon cancer surgery the former chief of staff 
contended that contrary to mcfarlanes testimony before the tower 
commission there was no mention of an armsforhostages deal 
in fact regan called the meeting routine in memory and 
contended he might not even have remembered it if i hadnt had 
such a difficult time persuading his reagans wife to let it take 
place 
there is nothing in my notes or memory to suggest that the 
idea of swapping arms for hostages was mentioned by either man on 
this occasion i am sure that any mention of such a scheme 
would have made me prick up my ears regan wrote 
the former chief of staff said he believes the presidents 
contention that he knew nothing of the diversion of funds to the 
contra rebels until told about it by attorney general edwin meese 
iii on nov 25 1986 
the president is a ruddy man with bright red cheeks he 
blanched when he heard meeses words the color drained from his 
face leaving his skin pasty white nobody who saw the 
presidents reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment that 
he knew about the diversion of funds before meese told him about 
it he was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had 
happened 
regan blamed reagans former aides for the debacle that befell 
the president and ultimately engulfed himself 
much of what happened was hidden from the president and 
incidentally from me by mcfarlane and his successor as national 
security adviser adm john poindexter and by the remarkable 
young marine who was a virtual stranger to both of us lt col 
oliver l north regan wrote 
as to the responsibility for the chaos that descended on the 
white house that appears to have been written in the stars he 
wrote 
he said that he urged the president to counteract the effects of 
the irancontra affair by undertaking an active speaking schedule 
outside washington but was balked by astrological advice to the 
first lady that harm would come to reagan if he went out of the 
white house 
by humoring her we had given her control he said of mrs 
reagan 
he says reagan was first told the details of the proposed arms 
sales to iran by mcfarlane during the november 1985 geneva summit 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
although he listened intently to mcfarlanes words the 
president asked few questions he wrote he looked straight at 
mcfarlane occasionally glancing at secretary of state george 
shultz or me as if to study our reactions he says shultz 
commented very sparingly during the 20minute meeting and the 
president ended by once again saying yes by not saying no 
the former chief of staff indicated the meeting was typical of 
reagans style 
regan related a stormy conversation between himself and the 
president on the day he found himself suddenly replaced by howard 
h baker jr as chief of staff reagan failed to persuade him to 
stay on and work with baker during the transition 
as regan described it he said im sorry mr president but 
i wont be in any more this is my last day ive been your 
secretary of the treasury for four years and your chief of staff 
for two you dont trust me enough even to tell me who my successor 
is and make a smooth transfer i deserved better treatment than 
this im through im very disappointed 
despite their difficult parting he wrote my admiration for 
reagan as president remains very great 
my judgment of him as a man in light of my final experience 
as his chief of staff underwent a certain change but this is 
irrelevant he said any man who had seen as much of the world 
as i had seen when i came to washington knew better than to put his 
trust in princes

rival shiite moslem militias ended a 
16hour truce sunday fighting each other with tanks mortars and 
truckmounted rocket launchers in battles that killed seven people 
and wounded 25 police said 
the toll from three days of fighting rose to 89 dead and 242 
wounded following the breakdown of an iranian and syrianbrokered 
ceasefire 
police said hostilities broke out in south beiruts densely 
populated districts of ghobeiri bir elabed and hay madi and 
quickly spread to five adjacent neighborhoods 
the fighting has included gunbattles inside a hospital where a 
doctor said militiamen forced surgeons to operate on dead comrades 
to bring them back to life 
justice minister nabih berris prosyrian amal militia and the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god accused each other of 
breaking the ceasefire 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for extremist factions 
holding many of the 18 kidnapped foreigners in lebanon some of 
whom are reportedly held in the embattled slums it was not known 
if the fighting had any effect on the captives 
the fighting was touched off friday by a predawn ambush in 
which four amal militiamen were killed amal blamed hezbollah 
the thud of explosions and bursts of gunfire resounded across 
the city sunday both sides mounted grenadethrowing assaults on 
each others positions 
several apartment buildings were ablaze but fire engines could 
not enter the area because of the fighting 
both sides went on a kidnapping spree abducting at least 20 
civilians suspected of sympathizing with either side police had 
said more than 100 other civilians have been abducted since the 
outbreak of the slums war 
an amal communique charged hezbollah gunmen were sniping at 
residential neighborhoods from rooftops of apartment buildings in 
the sprawling shiyah district and warned that this would spread 
the fighting 
shiyah abuts beiruts green line which has sliced the capital 
into moslem and christian sectors since the 1975 outbreak of 
lebanons civil war 
as the guns roared syria dispatched its military intelligence 
chief in lebanon brig gen ghazi kenaan to west beirut on an 
apparent mission to reinstate the ceasefire 
kenaan went into conference with berri at his sandbagged 
residence in west beiruts barbour neighborhood about five miles 
from the fighting 
staterun radio beirut said kenaan also met acting prime 
minister salim hoss a sunni moslem and shiite parliament speaker 
hussein husseini 
a coalition of the nations senior sunni and shiite religious 
leaders called on syria to send troops into the slums 
syria deployed 7500 troops in west beirut on feb 22 1987 to 
curb the reign of feuding militias the slums are outside the 
jurisdiction of that contingent 
the shortlived lull which began about midnight saturday 
allowed red cross and civil defense rescuers to evacuate scores of 
trapped victims hospitals issued urgent appeals for blood 
donations 
an iranian mission headed by deputy foreign minister hussein 
sheikholeslam also was trying to negotiate a new truce radio 
beirut said 
during the lull sunday morning the slums estimated 250000 
inhabitants of the slums began venturing from their basements and 
bomb shelters where they had been trapped for more than 50 hours 
what have i done to deserve all this asked ali shabshoul 
34 a grocer whose shop in bir elabed was reduced to a pile of 
rubble by shellfire his wife and two children stood crying beside 
him 
nabil alameh while taking stock of the damage to his perfume 
shop in an amalcontrolled neighborhood in ghobeiri asked who 
is going to compensate me 
when told that allah god would he retorted icily allah 
or his party an apparent reference to hezbollah 
many residents hurriedly packed up beds mattresses and clothes 
and drove away from the slums others installed new doors on 
damaged shops and houses 
a doctor at alsahel hospital which has received more than 100 
casualties from both sides said hezbollah and amal had clashed 
inside the building 
we have been forced many times to flee and abandon victims 
because of frequent gunfights in the emergency ward said the 
doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
she said doctors also had been forced at by frenzied gunmen to 
operate on dead comrades telling us at gunpoint to bring them 
back to life 
police said hezbollah appears to have made substantial 
territorial gains in the fighting around the ghobeiri district that 
is home to the partys mentor sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
but each side held its ground elsewhere 
during the lull in the fighting berri issued a statement 
accusing hezbollah of turning the slums into a a nest of terror 
where kidnapped foreigners are held hostage 
you are a war criminal retorted hezbollah in a statement 
released in west beirut and addressed to berri only spies of the 
great satan the united states call us terrorists 
in a fourday confrontation last month amal crushed hezbollah 
throughout south lebanon police said 62 people were killed and 150 
wounded

the reagan administration is putting together 
a 10 billion international aid program for the philippines after 
asking congress for a decrease in direct us assistance to the 
financially troubled ally 
the fiveyear plan originally proposed by two democratic and 
two republican members of congress would gather new money and 
benefits for the philippines from other nations including japan 
australia and european countries 
officials have not indicated what the us share would be 
the proposal patterned after the 1947 marshall plan to rescue 
western europe after world war ii is being put together while us 
negotiators in manila face demands for big increases in payments 
for the use of key air force and navy bases in the philippines 
philippine foreign minister raul manglapus has said us 
rent for the bases should be increased from the current 180 
million a year to as much as 12 billion annually and should be in 
addition to any other aid both congressional and administration 
officials have said that kind of money likely would not be 
available 
congress last year appropriated 347 million for the government 
of president corazon aquino the reagan administration has asked 
that that be cut to 257 million in the next fiscal year budget 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
saturday the administration is moving toward announcement of the 
international aid plan 
the administration also plans to send a highlevel special 
emissary to the philippines to dramatize its concern for conditions 
in the country the washington post reported on sunday 
the newspaper said a congressional delegation might accompany 
the official who would deliver a pledge of toplevel support and 
consult with aquino on details of the program 
the original proposal by sens alan cranston dcalif and 
richard lugar rind and reps stephen solarz dny and jack 
kemp rny called for at least 1 billion a year in new 
international aid to aquinos government and proposed that a 
prominent american be appointed by the president to lead the 
effort the post report said such an appointment was likely 
the philippines economy has been showing signs of increased 
health since a popular uprising in february 1986 ended two decades 
of authoritarian rule by ferdinand e marcos and installed mrs 
aquino but the government has had to use much of its income to 
meet interest payments on its 26 billion foreign debt 
the post citing unidentified sources said the aid plan would 
include debt relief in the form of reduced payments or debtequity 
swaps trade preferences to encourage philippine exports and 
private investments from international financial institutions and 
businesses in addition to direct aid

in nine of the past 10 presidential 
elections the candidate who avoided discussing problems and 
offered an optimistic outlook was the winner according to 
researchers 
they say those results are being borne out this year because 
of the pack of presidential hopefuls who began the race democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis and apparent republican nominee george 
bush offered the rosiest messages 
in analyzing nomination acceptance speeches of the two 
majorparty candidates since 1948 martin seligman and harold 
zullow psychologists at the university of pennsylvania found the 
candidate who avoided dwelling on national and personal problems 
and characterized troubles with an optimistic outlook ended up in 
the white house except in 1968 
that year hubert humphrey whose message rated slightly more 
upbeat than richard nixons came from behind in the polls to a 
narrow defeat on election day zullow said 
the danger is it tells a political candidate that if you shape 
statements to what they want to hear youll win an 
unscrupulous candidate can move further away from what he really 
means seligman said 
the correlation between the candidates ratings in the analysis 
and their actual margins of victory or defeat came almost as close 
as is possible in social science seligman said 
the researchers applied their theory to the 13 major candidates 
running at the beginning of the year for the democratic and 
republican nominations by analyzing texts of their speeches as 
published in the new york times in january and february 
the results of the study are due for publication in the american 
psychologist a psychology journal later this year 
the researchers counted the number of references to bad events 
or problems then had people who were unaware of the source of the 
sentences rate them for pessimism and optimism 
on the democratic side dukakis came in as the optimism winner 
followed by rep richard gephardt and jesse jackson bush was the 
winner for the republicans with former delaware gov pete du pont 
and sen bob dole behind him 
key to the high ratings for bush and dukakis zullow said was 
the low number of references to bad events but also a major factor 
in the equation was their tendency to view the problems 
optimistically citing forces outside the country or painting them 
as temporary troubles that would be overcome by a vote in their 
favor he said 
while jacksons campaign has been punctuated by a theme of hope 
his speeches frequently have focused on the problems of american 
society and politics zullow said 
dukakis tends to shy away more from discussing the countrys 
problems he said 
for instance a passage from a jackson speech about defense has 
him firmly blaming the reagan administration but using strong 
language in describing perceived troubles zullow said 
jackson said reagan put out the deal that we are weak 
militarily thats not true were the strongest military in the 
world 
but he adds our boys got killed in lebanonour boys are 
vulnerable in the persian gulf going up and down that river every 
day being looked at down the gun barrel of american made guns sold 
to the ayatollah illegally weve got a strong military and a weak 
commander in chief 
jackson loses points in the analysis by rekindling the trauma of 
the 241 marines and sailors killed by a car bomb in beirut and the 
current threat to the navy in the persian gulf 
bush like dukakis scored higher than the other party 
candidates by not dwelling on a problem and quickly looking to an 
optimistic future 
modern american voters seem to have a stable preference for 
candidates who are more hopeful zullow said

a 3year campaign that has succeeded in getting 
northeastern university to award an honorary degree to jailed south 
african nationalist leader nelson mandela has raised objections 
from some faculty and students 
northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring 
mandela on may 13 ending a long effort by students seeking to 
change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who 
could not be present at the ceremony 
the degree is to be accepted by south african archbishop desmond 
tutu who is scheduled to be in boston for a benefit dinner 
law students last september began a campaign of demonstrations 
and vigils on the campus they hung a banner from the second floor 
of the law library that said honor nelson mandela 
before he was imprisoned said thirdyear law student sarah 
ottinger nelson mandela was an attorney and an activist who 
worked against apartheid thats the message we wanted conveyed to 
students 
south africas whiteminority government says it will free 
mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking 
political power for blacks in the country 
some faculty members and students including many blacks have 
criticized the administrations plan for the event saying no 
effort was made to include them 
i dont even know what office is sponsoring it said keith 
motley dean and director of the africanamerican institute a 
student group we got a memo from the administration saying they 
need six ushers but thats it 
youd think at least wed be clued in to whats going on 
this started out as something noble something weve tried to 
have done for three years said ottinger we are very very 
sorry it happened this way it wasnt meant to turn out like this 
the trustees decided in january that mandela should get the 
honorary degree students set up a committee to contact mandelas 
family to get their approval 
university spokesman paul jones said letters were sent to 
mandelas wife winnie and his two daughters zenani a student at 
boston university and makaziwe a student at the university of 
massachusetts at boston 
however northeastern still has not received approval from the 
mandela family the boston globe reported

the best of the worst the tops of the 
lowest the most awful assaults on the art of writing were honored 
sunday in the annual bulwerlytton fiction contest 
the top prize the creme de la dreck went to rachel 
sheeley 20 a journalism student at franklin college in indiana 
id hate to say that bad writing comes naturally but my 
creative juices were flowing that day sheeley said in a 
telephone interview sunday you have to get into a bad frame of 
mind 
she said she is a wouldbe novelist but im a pretty bad 
procrastinator so for now i want to go into newspaper writing and 
have a deadline to write for 
whether a boon or bane for her career the prize came from san 
jose state university professor scott rice founder and grand 
panjandrum of the literary disgrace he calls the baltimore 
orioles of literature 
despite the humor that surrounds its awarding rice stresses 
that the competition is not a jokewriting contest it really 
takes a very good writer to deliberately write bad 
the contest trashes the battered memory of 19th century english 
writer edward george earle bulwerlytton his turgid style is 
captured in the opening line to one of his novels later enshrined 
by snoopy the erudite pooch in the comic strip peanuts it was a 
dark and stormy night 
rice notes that bulwerlytton also is remembered for such 
ringing cliches as the pen is mightier than the sword and the 
great unwashed 
this years noribbon panel of undistinguished judges examined 
more than 11000 entries searching for the most miserable least 
readable and rottenest lead sentence to the crummiest novel 
imaginable 
this awful thing submitted by miss sheeley brought her to the 
top or the bottom of the heap 
like an expensive sports car finetuned and wellbuilt 
portia was sleek shapely and gorgeous her red jumpsuit moulding 
her body which was as warm as the seatcovers in july her hair as 
dark as new tires her eyes flashing like bright hubcaps and her 
lips dewy as the beads of fresh rain on the hood she was a woman 
driven fueled by a single accelerant and she needed a man a 
man who wouldnt shift from his views a man to steer her along the 
right road a man like alf romeo 
rice said the contest is a gentle reminder to the world of 
letters that it is ok to lighten up forget the grammar books for a 
minute and have some fun to approach the language recreationally 
as well as practically 
for her effort sheeley wins a word processor 
awards were also made in selected categories 
brian w holmes of san jose calif won in puns once a month 
when the moon is full reverend jim bleaker and his lovely wife 
teddi invite members of the church to the parsonage for an evening 
of hymn singing followed by cookies tea and a frenzied orgy on 
the lawn outside making sure of course to take all the usual 
precautions for safe sects 
joan mazulelwicz of liverpool ny won for purple prose the 
silent snow fell relentlessly unceasingly mercilessly from the 
sordid sullied surreality of the sky as if some enormous ethereal 
diner were shaking grated parmesan on the great soggy meatball 
that was earth 
michael stratford miles city mont won for science fiction 
shirley doubted that her alien escort composed as he was of 
vegetable matter seaweed and a thick coating of swampy muck 
would be a suitable date for the intergalactic kegger but he 
turned out to be a real fungi 
r b nelson nottinghamshire england won for detective novel 
with the radio squawking that a 4711 was in progress at 37th and 
127th murphy knocked car 495 into 3rd and headed up 5th at 70 
little reckoning as he thumbed his 38 that this would be the day

pope john paul ii visited uruguays 
impoverished gaucho country sunday and voiced strong support 
for labor unions but he warned against groups claiming to have all 
the answers to workers problems 
the pope told a crowd of about 50000 that he feels close in 
word and heart to those involved in union activities an apparent 
reference to the labor unrest in his native poland on saturday 
during his flight from rome to uruguay john paul expressed 
approval of the polish strikes 
cowboys on horseback wearing flatcrowned black hats and 
blankets draped over their shoulders lined the route to the popes 
prayer service in a redcanopied altar erected in a large park 
those who with zeal and sacrifice seek to better the 
conditions of workers deserve unconditioned support said john 
paul 
he said no ideology can claim to have a monopoly on solutions 
to social problems the church he said cannot allow any 
ideology or political group to snatch from it the flag of justice 
this was a frequent theme on john pauls eight earlier visits to 
latin america especially in places where marxists challenge the 
established economic order 
although the pope didnt mention poland in his melo remarks 
vatican officials said he was following the situation there 
closely an aide said john paul had been informed that his words of 
support saturday were received with indescribable joy by 
striking workers in polands gdansk shipyard according to reports 
reaching rome 
as john paul flew the 250 miles to melo from montevideo his 
uruguayan air force jet passed over herds of grazing cattle but 
despite the cattle industry melo is one of uruguays poorest 
areas the town of 39000 people near the brazilian border has been 
hit hard by unemployment 
referring to the distribution of wealth john paul said those 
who own land and other property have an obligation to put their 
wealth to the benefit of the entire community 
private property includes a social mortgage he said 
john paul frequently cited the churchs social teaching 
including an encyclical he wrote in 1981 on the problems of work 
the pope had cited that document as giving justification to the 
strikes taking place in poland 
the pope visited melo on the second day of a 12day four 
country south american visit 
at sunset the pope led a mass in a soccer stadium filled with 
20000 people in florida 68 miles north of montevideo he ordained 
12 uruguayan priests and one argentine during the threehour 
ceremony 
there was a brief incident when the pope left a cleared path to 
touch hands with members of the crowd as he entered the stadium 
security personnel surrounding the pope who was seriously wounded 
in a may 1981 assassination attempt in rome edged several people 
out of the way until he returned to the path 
the pope reminded the crowd including many teenagers of 
uruguays christian origins and then told the newly ordained 
priests your task is enormous youll be in the center of the 
dialogue between god and mankind about salvation 
several people were allowed on the stage to present the pope 
with gifts including a tapestry and a fawn that the pontiff petted 
on the head 
our people as you know well need more priests the pope 
said uruguay is considered the least religious country in south 
america its president is a selfproclaimed agnostic divorce has 
been legal since 1907 and church and state have been separated for 
61 years 
in montevideo a polishjewish survivor of a nazi concentration 
camp in world war ii said sunday that the pope embraced him with 
great emotion upon meeting him and hearing his story 
chil rajman 75 now an uruguayan citizen said that during a 
brief meeting saturday night between the pope and members of this 
countrys small jewish community he mentioned that he had been in 
the germanrun death camp in treblinka poland 
the pope grasped my hand with great emotion and said to me 
you were in treblinka and you survived rajman said 
pedro sclofsky the president of uruguays central jewish 
committee said that during the meeting at montevideos catholic 
university the pope asked how many jews there are here and if we 
practice our faith freely 
uruguay with about 50000 jews among its 3 million inhabitants 
guarantees the freedom of all religions although most uruguayans 
are nominally catholic the country rigorously separates church and 
government in all areas 
the popes itinerary included two days in uruguay before flying 
monday to bolivia for five days and then visiting peru and paraguay 
john paul returns to rome on may 18 his 68th birthday this is 
his 37th foreign trip since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago

joan quigley a san francisco heiress who has 
authored books on astrology said sunday she is the friend who 
advised first lady nancy reagan on matters such as safe times for 
the president to travel 
i cant deny that she has consulted me ms quigley said in 
a telephone interview from her nob hill home i am very 
uncomfortable however with the situation because normally i never 
discuss the identity of my clients and i never discuss their 
affairs 
i am a serious scientific astrologer and i am really not one 
of these clowns and i really dont like this circus atmosphere 
said ms quigley who has been practicing astrology since 1960 and 
has written three books on the subject 
ms quigleys revelation followed reports on the book for the 
record from wall street to washington in which donald t regan 
writes that virtually every major move and decision the reagans 
made during my time as white house chief of staff was cleared in 
advance with a woman in san francisco who drew up horoscopes to 
make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the 
enterprise 
regan confessed that he never learned the identity of the woman 
whom he said mrs reagan referred to only as my friend in san 
francisco 
time magazine which published excerpts from the book first 
identified the woman 
ms quigley who frequently appears on the merv griffin 
television show said she was first introduced to mrs reagan by 
griffin 
i really didnt get actively involved until the first 
campaign for president by reagan she told the associated press 
she said she did astrological work for the campaign but declined 
to give details 
after the assassination attempt mrs reagan asked me if she 
could consult me because she was worried about the presidents 
safety as well she might be ms quigley said 
she said mrs reagan telephoned her at various times 
sometimes on saturday afternoons from camp david the presidential 
retreat in maryland as regan reported 
i certainly never controlled the presidents actions she 
said mrs reagan would want to know if something was a safe time 
and i certainly advised her on that 
ms quigley said her advice is based on the exact time and place 
of a persons birth 
in a separate interview with time she said an astrologer 
just picks the best possible time to do something that someone else 
has already planned to do it is like being in the ocean you 
should go with the waves not against them

democratic presidential contender jesse 
jackson delivered a fresh attack on george bush sunday saying the 
vice president has started to panic 
last week bush referred to jackson as a hustler from 
chicago jackson has been excoriating the apparent republican 
nominee ever since 
now as we get closer the opposition hears our footprints and 
begins to panic jackson said vice president bush has begun to 
panic and has begun to call me names hes panicking with 
indecision hes panicking with selective memory 
why would anyone resort to namecalling jackson said a 
combination of constipation of the brain deafness of ideas and 
diarrhea of the mouth 
bush made the hustler remark on friday as he campaigned in 
lincoln neb his campaign staff said there was nothing 
derogatory intended in the remark spokesman stephen hart later 
said it was meant as a comment on how hard jackson has worked 
jackson was not mollified 
hes trapped in an unholy triangle between the ayatollah 
noriega and meese he said of bush referring to iranian leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega and attorney general edwin meese iii 
jacksons comments came as he was here delivering a graduation 
address for his alma mater north carolina aampt state university 
jackson graduated from the college in 1964 
campaigning later sunday in west virginia which holds its 
primary on tuesday jackson reacted strongly to reports that bush 
had been briefed three years ago about drug trafficking by noriega 
the reason mr bush has not led the charge to fight drugs is 
because he knew of the administrations dealings with the drug 
dealers jackson told reporters at huntingtons tristate 
airport we must be leaders in an aggressive drive to stop drugs 
in our country 
everett ellis briggs us ambassador to honduras on sunday 
denied a report in sundays new york times that said that while he 
was ambassador to panama he had briefed bush in 1985 on evidence of 
drug trafficking by noriega 
i could not have briefed the vice president on noriegas drug 
running drug smuggling or money laundering activities because we 
simply did not have evidence of those activities at that time 
briggs said at a news conference in tegucigalpa honduras 
neither bush nor democratic frontrunner michael dukakis had any 
campaign appearances on sunday 
can i compete with dukakis and bush jackson said thats 
harvard and yale they have the prestige they have the power 
structure they have the press they have the pundits and yet i 
must not surrender ive always battled the odds and won im a 
survivor 
a number of his family members were in the audience including 
his wife jacqueline and his two sons jesse jr and jonathan both 
of whom were awarded degrees during the ceremony 
jackson reflected on his years at north carolina aampt and on the 
years since his graduation recalling his activism as a participant 
in civil rights sitins to demand desegregation of public 
facilities in greensboro 
he urged the 900 graduating students in the greensboro coliseum 
not to allow difficult circumstances to stifle their dreams 
as i get closer to the white house there are no more 
impossible dreams he said 
jackson said his showing has been strong despite being 
outfunded by his democratic rival 
ive come from further back with fewer resources running 
strong and dont feel no ways tired he said 
now just dont say run jesse run i run that you might run 
if i run for president surely you can run for governor if i run 
for president surely you can run for senator 
jackson sounding a familiar theme said many young blacks might 
see him campaigning on television and suspect that he cannot 
understand their difficulties 
i was born in the slum but the slum was not born in me he 
said invoking his early years jacksons mother was an unmarried 
teenager when she gave birth to him 
born in threeroom house parents who didnt have health 
insurance i understand bathroom on the back porch slop jar by 
the bed i understand 
had to hang out clothes on nails i understand wallpaper used 
for windbreaker not for decoration i understand had stand by an 
open stove to get heat i really do understand 
against those odds i never earned the right to do less 
than my best and you do not have the right than to do less than 
your best he told the students

to a second sevenyear term in a resounding victory over 
conservative premier jacques chirac 
the socialist president pledged to fight the anguish difficulty 
and uncertainty facing many french people 
you have chosen to accord me your confidence said 
mitterrand 71 
there is too much anguish too much difficulty and too much 
uncertainty for too many in our society for us to forget that our 
first duty is national solidarity he said because the life of 
humanity depends on it i will act passionately in your name for 
the development of poor nations for disarmament and peace 
chirac conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed 
mitterrand supporters drove along the main champselysees avenue 
cheering and honking horns 
in a democracy the public is the master and i bow before its 
choice the premier said i wish good luck to france and good 
luck to the french 
vote counting was suspended early monday with 981 percent of 
the ballots tabulated mitterrand had 5391 percent and chirac 
4609 percent the turnout was 845 percent less than the 859 
percent in the 1981 presidential election more than 38 million 
people were eligle to vote 
chirac was expected to submit the resignation of his government 
in the coming days his centerright coalition continues to control 
the national assembly but mitterrand has said the new premier he 
will name will try to work with the present parliament failing 
that he will be forced to dissolve the assembly and call new 
elections 
the staterun antenne 2 tv network projected mitterrand would 
receive 539 percent of the vote the most since georges pompidou 
won 582 percent in the 1969 runoff 
in the first round of elections on april 24 mitterrand won 341 
percent of the vote to lead a field of nine candidates chirac was 
second with 199 percent 
jeanmarie le pen leader of the extreme right national front 
who won an astonishing 144 percent of the vote in the first round 
said in a bitter statement that the traditional right was the 
stupidest right in the world 
he blamed chirac for scorning the national front and said that 
was responsible for mitterrands victory 
today france is back in the dead end it could have escaped 
he said 
former president valery giscard destaing a centrist who 
supported chirac said mitterrands reelection was a defeat for 
the governments centerright policies 
the president is going to name a new government giscard 
said we will judge it by its acts one should not decide in 
advance to vote against it i will vote for the laws that i find 
good and i will vote against the laws that i find bad 
the campaign ended on a dramatic note with the chirac 
government winning the release of french hostages in lebanon and 
new caledonia 
election day was not without its problems in central paris a 
group of masked men wielding steel bars charged into a rightwing 
rally celebrating joan of arc day seven people were injured five 
seriously no group claimed responsibility 
in the tiny alpine village of st eusebeenchampsaur the local 
pta called for a boycott of the election to protest the planned 
closure of the village school next fall the school has only 12 
pupils but the pta says there have been a large number of births 
in the past three years that will increase future classes 
two weeks ago only 16 of the villages 135 registered voters 
cast their ballots in the first round 
the election marked the first time in the 30year history of the 
fifth republic that an incumbent chief executive and his premier 
faced one another for the presidency 
political debate throughout the long campaign focused largely on 
generalities with few concrete proposals made by either candidate 
during the last week of the campaign three french hostages were 
released in lebanon and french gendarmes freed a group of hostages 
taken by separatists in new caledonia 
although chirac said saturday the incidents were not timed to 
coincide with the election the events became an important element 
in the last hours of the campaign 
mitterrand has said he contributed to the release of the 
hostages there is no distinction between the government and me 
in such a sensitive matter he said 
mitterrand who has moved markedly toward the center of the 
political spectrum since he came to power in a socialist landslide 
seven years ago issued a long letter to all the french 
as opposed to 1981 when he campaigned on 110 specific 
proposals his 1988 platform was vague built around a rallying 
of the french people for a united france and social justice 
most of his ideas are aimed at getting france ready for 1992 
when the european economic community drops all remaining trade 
barriers and creates a true common market 
among his few specific proposals mitterrand said he will stop 
the cycle of nationalization and privatization of french companies 
reestablish the wealth tax abolished by the right when it came to 
power in the national assembly in 1986 and create a minumum 
guaranteed income his top priority will emphasize training and 
research as the key to fighting frances 104 percent unemployment 
chiracs platform titled the decade of renewal had three 
basic themes family business and training he pledged to continue 
the policies begun in 1986 when the conservatives and centrists 
ousted the socialists from the national assembly 
the premiers platform which also focuses on modernizing the 
french economy before 1992 is short on figures but calls for 
continuing to reduce taxes on business and individuals a 
threeyear budget deficit reduction program further 
denationalizations and an end to new immigration 
mitterrands current term ends at midnight may 20

reports that many of atlantas banks restrict 
home loans in black neighborhoods have generated strong protests 
from political leaders despite bankers denials 
in a series of reports last week the atlanta journal and the 
atlanta constitution said a study showed that white neighborhoods 
received five times as much money in home loans in 1986 as black 
neighborhoods with the same income level the newspapers suggested 
that race helped determine lending patterns an illegal practice 
known as redlining 
i want to hear from some of our banking friends and people at 
the savings and loans said atlanta city council president marvin 
arrington who is black 
last week the city council formed a committee of bankers 
politicians and citizens to investigate lending practices and make 
recommendations in 20 days 
state banking commissioner jack dunn said georgia needs a law 
requiring banks to reinvest deposits in their communities 
the fulton county commission unanimously approved a law 
prohibiting discrimination in the sale rental or finance of 
housing 
i feel that the banks really do owe not only affirmative 
action in regard to this but an apology to the city as a whole 
whether theyve known about it or not said commission chairman 
michael lomax who is black and i think they owe us an apology 
for some of the characterizations theyve made of the black 
community 
the newspapers said federal statistics showed that loans to 
atlantas middleincome black neighborhoods averaged 33927 per 
singlefamily home in 1986 compared with 243282 in 
middleincome white neighborhoods 
the newspapers also said banks closed branches or restricted 
business hours and gave lower property assessments in mostly black 
neighborhoods they said the banking practices hindered economic 
development in the citys mostly black south side 
officials of several financial institutions that attended a 
special city council meeting last week denied that anything other 
than economics determines their lending they did not dispute the 
newspapers figures though and offered few suggestions for 
boosting loans in black areas 
its called the first rule of banking said james wallace 
vice president of fulton federal savings and loan dont lend 
money if you wont get it back 
much of the housing in predominately black areas is 
substandard requiring rehabilitation to qualify for mortgage 
lending said trust company bank spokesman willis johnson as a 
result this cannot be handled through conventional mortgage 
lending channels 
ed wood executive vice president of citizens trust bank a 
blackowned institution disagreed 
i have difficulty believing that most of the housing in black 
neighborhoods is substandard he said that is where the black 
community of atlanta really got its name nationally people who 
come from outside are amazed black folks got these kinds of 
houses here 
citizens trust which lends mostly to blacks had a lower 
default rate on real estate loans than the six largest banks in 
atlanta and the lowest of any bank its size in the nation in 1986 
according to the federal financial institutions examination 
council a government agency that reports for bank examiners 
some people suggested blacks should withdraw deposits from banks 
that wont do business with them 
if lending policies and practices do not change substantially 
to meet the concerns and demands of the black consumer market then 
withdrawing funds from the recalcitrant banks and banks with poor 
policies would be a logical step to take said earl shinhoster 
southeastern regional director of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people

a tentative deal in which striking 
shipworkers would get more pay but not press for reinstatement of 
solidarity took shape in talks revived at the urging of the 
countrys interior minister strike leaders said 
czeslaw kiszczak who also is a ranking communist party 
politburo member twice telephoned a lawyer acting as a mediator to 
revive the talks after they broke down late in the afternoon 
strike committee members said 
the conversations between kiszczak and lawyer wladyslaw 
silanowicki a former member of the outlawed solidarity trade 
union who has since agreed to serve on polish leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelskis consultative citizens council led to the resumption 
sunday night they said 
the talks resumed at 9 pm 3 pm edt three hours after 
solidarity leader lech walesa and about 1000 other workers defied 
a management ultimatum to leave the shipyard or face prosecution 
as a result of the talks the strike committee wrote a letter to 
management in which it agreed to end the strike and postpone its 
longterm goal of reinstating solidarity under the following 
conditions 
guarantee of safe passage from the shipyard for strikers and 
the people who have assisted them 
promises of no disciplinary action against strikers including 
fines dismissals or prosecutions and formation of a joint 
committee from members of the strike committee and the shipyard 
workers council to oversee implementation of the agreement 
a wage increase of 38 on the average monthly wage of the last 
three months about 105 
according to strike committee chairman alojzy szablewski and 
other committee members an agreement was near 
the remaining sticking points were the creation of the joint 
committee objected to by management and whether the rank and file 
strikers were willing to give up demands for solidarity they said 
it was not known whether the two sides planned to push for an 
agreement through the night or try again monday 
the number of strikers was only about half the 8001000 
reported inside the yard friday according to western reporters 
there sunday 
although a settlement appeared within reach strikers inside 
said they still feared a police action against the strike 
thousands of worshipers packed a church in this baltic port city 
in a show of support for the strikers 
in krakow polands roman catholic primate cardinal jozef glemp 
spoke out for the right of all people to participate in societys 
decisions 
all was quiet at the shipyard late sunday after the deadline in 
the management ultimum passed at 6 pm noon edt 
piotr konopka an aide to walesa said the negotiations sunday 
afternoon lasted only one hour and managements hard line stood in 
sharp contrast to talks saturday that the union considered a big 
step forward 
the prosecutor and manager listed an ultimatum saying all who 
leave before six are safe and will not be prosecuted konopka 
said speaking to reporters at st brygidas church near the 
shipyard 
the lenin shipyard strike began monday and came during a period 
of labor upheaval that has been the worst in poland since the 1981 
military crackdown 
the strikers have also demanded higher pay anmesty for the 
workers occupying the shipyard and the reinstatement of union 
activists fired by the plant 
riot police blockaded the shipyard on thursday and have not 
allowed any food in since friday 
a predawn raid by riot police crushed a 10day strike by 
steelworkers in nowa huta in southern poland on thursday and some 
shipyard workers said they feared a similar action 
glemp said in his sermon that the church can point out the 
road toward specific solutions but it is necessary to remember 
that every man has the right to participate in decisions 
concernings the society in which he lives 
his sermon followed a statement saturday by polishborn pope 
john paul ii that strikes can be justified and poland lacked true 
democracy 
about 5000 strike supporters crammed inside st brygidas 
church to pray for those in the lenin shipyard the 1980 birthplace 
of solidarity about 2000 more flooded the streets nearby and 
thousands of police stood guard around the church 
disgrace disgrace the crowd chanted when the rev henryk 
jankowski walesas friend and adviser delivered his sermon 
why should we support the striking workers jankowski asked 
the crowd rhetorically because they are fighting for our rights 
the shipyard is the symbol of all of poland 
his speech was interrupted with chants of lech walesa lech 
walesa and there is no freedom without solidarity 
on saturday night walesa told the strikers that if a raid came 
ill be the last to leave the shipyard 
the shipyard strike was the latest of five strikes in poland 
in each case workers have pressed for higher wages to 
counteract inflation which reached 42 percent in the first three 
months of 1988 
the government has said the strikes could derail polands 
attempts to reform its ailing economy by raising prices reducing 
goverment subsidies introducing competition and encouraging 
private and managerial enterprise 
one of jaruzelskis closest advisers lt col wieslaw gornicki 
said sunday that the strikes were a normal outgrowth of making 
our economy more efficient 
this always and everywhere brings about some tribulations 
he said interviewed from poland on abcs this week with david 
brinkley

rodrigo borja won sundays presidential 
election in the runoff race between two leftists to succeed 
proamerican president leon febres cordero 
thank you ecuador thank you borja said on television in 
the capital we will have a government by the people and for the 
people 
thousands of borjas supporters in quito his highland 
stronghold swarmed into the streets to celebrate and caravans of 
cars with their horns blaring packed the citys avenues 
borjas rival abdala bucaram conceded defeat in an address 
over national television from his power base in guayaquil 
there are no excuses dr rodrigo borja is the president of 
ecuador bucaram said 
with the count nearly complete borja had 1584483 of the valid 
votes and bucaram 1344200 
political analysts had said the election was too close to call 
public opinion polls showed 25 percent of the countrys 47 million 
eligible voters still undecided in the final weeks of the campaign 
election oficials had estimated the voter turnout would be about 80 
percent 
borja and bucaram had conducted a bitter campaign marked by 
exchanges of insults in their race to replace febres cordero a 
conservative who has promoted freemarket policies and befriended 
the united states 
febres cordero voted in guayaquil and discounted persistent 
rumors of a military coup if bucaram is elected coups are out of 
fashion he said 
bucaram has charged that the right spread the rumors to try to 
prevent him from winning 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the election pitted borja a 52yearold law professor and 
leader of the democratic left party against bucaram a 
toughtalking 36yearold populist who vowed to punish the 
oligarchy 
sirens and church bells echoed sunday through the streets of 
this city 9300 feet high in the andes signaling opening of polls 
voters included colorfully dressed highland indians from the 
outskirts of the capital indians make up 35 percent of ecuadors 
population of 10 million 
campaign violence intensified in the final weeks before the 
election leaving three people dead and more than a dozen wounded 
newspapers and roman catholic church leaders blamed the clashes on 
the vitriolic rhetoric of the candidates 
bucaram leader of the roldosista party called his adversary a 
drunkard a drug addict and an atheist a potentially damaging 
accusation in this heavily catholic nation he also used coarse 
street language to question borjas manliness 
borja an urbane usually reserved politician from quito 
responded with insults of his own calling bucaram a fascist 
ignoramus 
borja and bucaram qualified for the runoff by leading a field of 
10 candidates in the first round of voting jan 31 borja won 20 
percent of the vote and bucaram took 15 
febres cordero of the social christian party came in third a 
sign of his governments low popularity 
borja who lost a close runoff to the president in 1984 and was 
making his third bid for the presidency pledged to reverse the 
governments freemarket economic policies and seek close ties to 
the nonaligned movement 
bucaram is political boss of the huge slums that sprawl over the 
outskirts of guayaquil the countrys largest city and its major 
port 
his opponents accused him of making demagogic appeals to the 
poor including promises to give free shoes to all poor children 
and nearly double the monthly minimum wage to 55 
his followers affectionally call him the crazy one because 
of his fiery speaking style during the campaign he recorded a 
song titled thats why they call me crazy 
this small nation returned to democracy in 1979 after nine years 
of civilian and military dictatorships 
febres cordero whose fouryear term ends in august has had a 
stormy relationship with leftist and populist parties that 
controlled congress he also put down a rebellion by an air force 
commander halfway through his presidency 
his successor faces the most serious national economic crisis 
since ecuador began exporting oil in the early 1970s 
the economy shrank in 1987 by 35 percent and inflation is 
expected to climb to at least 50 percent this year the highest 
level since 1983 
febres corderos supporters blame the problems on a sharp drop 
in the price of oil ecuadors main source of income and economic 
damage from a devastating earthquake in march 1987

plane landed at a us air base on sunday after panamanian security 
agents harassed his own security detail waiting for him at a 
commercial airport a us embassy official said 
davis was returning with family members from contadora island 
off the pacific coast of panama when the plane landed at paitilla 
airport in the capital said embassy spokesman terrence kneebone 
as the small jet landed davis saw several panamanian security 
agents armed with rifles harassing the ambassadors security 
detail kneebone said 
davis then decided to have the plane take off and land instead 
at howard air base five miles to the northwest in the canal zone 
one of the panamanian security agents at paitilla airport was 
demanding to know who was on the plane with davis said kneebone 
the us security officials were in contact with the plane by 
radio as it came in to land the kneebone said and spoke with 
davis once on the ground it was then decided in the face of 
fairly hostile actions on the part of the panamanian agents to 
fly the plane elsewhere he added 
the plane then radioed for and received takeoff clearance from 
the airport tower before flying on to howard 
the ambassador never got out of his plane he said 
davis daughter and other family members were aboard the 
aircraft

off the official said

officials

a new minnesota law that will ban plastic 
foam packaging made with ozonedamaging chlorofluorocarbons isnt 
creating much of a stir in the packaging industry but the laws 
backers say its symbolic impact is substantial 
by enacting restrictions against foam packaging produced with 
the compound known as cfcs the state has created a vehicle for 
possible future restrictions on other products made with cfcs 
lawmakers and industry watchers say 
it will send a very strong message to industries who use cfcs 
that they have to clean up their act said sen greg dahl who 
helped shepherd the law through the legislature 
cfcproduced foam containers used for packaging fast food and 
other products may not be sold or made in the state beginning in 
1990 
the plastic foam packaging industry isnt worried partly 
because it does not have a manufacturing presence in minnesota 
furthermore manufacturers already have agreed to use a substitute 
chemical compound that is less damaging to the ozone layer than are 
cfcs 
i dont foresee it as a problem for anyone in the industry 
said jim lammers a spokesman for dart container corp of mason 
mich the nations leading producer of foam cups and containers 
but even though the minnesota law is regarded as a marshmallow 
its chief authors and environmental experts say it its symbolic 
effect and future implications are important 
its like the seat belt law with no fine said rep steve 
trimble who along with dahl herded the bill through the 
legislature its a warning to people 
the cfc packaging ban breezed through the minnesota legislature 
this year and was signed by gov rudy perpich trimble said maine 
was the only other state with a similar law 
gaseous cfcs are used to expand polystyrene beads into the foamy 
plastic containers that some fastfood chains are using to package 
hamburgers egg cartons cups and cafeteria trays also commonly 
use the product lammers said 
the chemical compound escapes to the atmosphere during 
production slowly rising 15 to 25 miles to deplete the ozone layer 
that protects the earth from the suns cancercausing ultraviolet 
rays some cfcs are trapped in the foam products and released later 
the foodservice amp packaging institute stated last month that the 
industry would be operating with a lessdamaging substitute 
chemical by 1989 
the substitute known as hcfc22 was approved last december by 
the us food and drug administration and three major 
environmental groups support its use until a completely safe 
substitute is found hcfc22 still has some potential for damaging 
the ozone layer but the environmental protection agency estimates 
it is only about 5 percent as powerful as cfcs 
cfc use in making food packaging foams account for only 15 
percent to 2 percent of the united states total cfc use 
but dean abrahamson a professor of public affairs at the 
humphrey institute said the minnesota law would have an impact 
because its an indication of the states concern 
he said the cfc law on the books could be strengthened later to 
cover other sources of cfcs which also are used in refrigeration 
units and construction materials 
next year im sure well come back and look at this issue some 
more trimble said 
dahl said he would like to pass legislation next year requiring 
warning labels on other products that contain or are manufactured 
with cfcs 
under the new law state and local governments will be banned 
beginning january 1 from purchasing manufacturing selling or 
distributing packaging known to be cfcprocessed the ban will be 
extended to cover all citizens beginning jan 1 1990 violators 
could be fined up to 500 
the law passed by the 1988 legislature also appropriates 25000 
to the minnesota pollution control agency to study ways to 
eliminate other cfc sources in the state

the action has been unusually lively of late for 
the 900000plus investors who own shares of general motors corp 
in the stock market debacle last fall gm shares lost some 47 
percent of their value plummeting from a high of 94 to a low of 
50 in the few months since then they have recovered more than 
half that loss rallying past 75 
of course many stocks have experienced wide swings in the past 
year but the behavior of gm has been noteworthy for several 
reasons 
given its standing as the nations second most widely owned 
stock outranked only by american telephone amp telegraph the ups 
and downs of gms price have had a farreaching impact on the 
finances and emotions of the investing public 
whats more gm has long been regarded as a quintessential blue 
chip a relatively stable investment supported by a generous 
dividend yield 66 percent as of late last week 
through the mid1980s it lived up to that billing from early 
1983 through early 1987 gm swung back and forth in a range roughly 
between 60 and 85 
it was only when the long bull market reached its climax last 
year that the stock jumped to a new high and subsequently toppled 
to a fiveyear low 
certainly some of that increased volatility can be attributed 
to the flighty environment for stocks in general gm holds a 
prominent place in the market indexes used by professionals in 
computerprogram trading 
but as any casual reader of the business news would readily 
conclude there has been more to the story than that 
as a giant enterprise plagued by mounting competition from both 
foreign automakers and its domestic counterparts the company has 
come under increased criticism in recent years about its management 
decisions and ways of doing business 
the negative reviews perhaps reached a crescendo in 
midfebruary when fortune magazine described 1988 as the 
makeorbreak year for the worlds biggest company and carried a 
cover story in which erstwhile board member ross perot described 
how i would turn around gm 
at the same time however many wall street analysts who follow 
the auto industry were taking a different view that the company 
was beginning to sort out its problems cut its costs and improve 
its earnings prospects 
chuck brady an analyst at the investment firm of oppenheimer amp 
co declares the turnaround at gm continues 
on the product side momentum has shifted gms products both 
cars and trucks are selling better than last year 
internal audits show that quality is up significantly and by 
most accounts style in design is improving too we continue to 
believe gm represents an excellent investment opportunity 
not all the companys followers on the street are quite so 
sanguine said kathleen heaney of nikko securities international in 
a recent report 
the major problem as we see it is not the companys 
shortterm potential of profitability but whether gm is capable of 
building and selling cars that will be competitive with the next 
generation of japanese and european vehicles 
the company is still extremely vulnerable to negative news 
and hence our reluctance to jump on the gm bandwagon 
wherever it is headed in the future the recent strength in the 
price of the stock is heartening to followers of the gm 
bellwether as an indicator of the overall market outlook 
robert stovall president of the moneymanagement firm 
stovalltwentyfirst advisers says this indicator has been bullish 
since gm shares went four months without matching or going below 
their oct 19 low of 50 
stovall concedes the patterns in gms stock chart arent an 
infallible guide to the market outlook the bellwether got 
caught in the midst of the flock in the crash last fall 
nevertheless he says it is now heralding a summer rally

mike halstead mopped his face with a 
towel as he walked away from an exhausting session that had nothing 
to do with making cars at the local mazda motor corp plant 
halstead headed for the shower while other mazda employees 
continued grunting through repetitions on weight machines pedaled 
away on manual exercise bikes and worked on balance and agility on 
a simulated crosscountry ski unit in one corner of the flat rock 
plants fitness center 
job one the first mazda car made at flat rock rolled off 
the assembly line in september in november the company opened the 
1 million fitness center in a 90000squarefoot section of one of 
the plant buildings 
fitness programs once the reserve of management are moving 
from the front office to the plant floor at many companies said 
thomas merry midwest region vice president for fitness systems 
thats where we see the direction of this thing going 
its been an administrative headquarters whitecollar kind of 
phenomenon said merry whose los angelesbased company designs 
sets up and operates fitness programs now he said we do see 
more plant sites getting involved 
reasons range from simple economics an unhealthy worker costs 
more to keep on the job to companies desire to be involved with 
employees as a way of keeping them involved in their work 
at flat rock the matter was never in question said don r 
kricho personnel safety and health director 
japanese corporations routinely provide extras for improving the 
health and lifestyle of their employees single workers may even 
live in company dormitories there 
it was always pretty much taken for granted that we were going 
to do something in terms of a fitness center kricho said in 
japan its something they do 
a study conducted last year on the staywell program control data 
corp of minneapolis implemented for its employees linked higher 
health insurance claims with various risk factors including lack 
of exercise smoking excess weight and high cholesterol 
for example sedentary employees have 30 percent more hospital 
days than those who get adequate exercise and employees who smoke a 
pack or more of cigarettes a day have 18 percent higher medical 
claims costs than nonsmokers 
there are some very solid practical business reasons for 
wanting to do this mazdas kricho said fit happy workers 
produce more they are less likely to be absent they are less 
likely to be injured 
before and after work at flat rock as early as 530 am and as 
late as 9 pm the sounds of weight machines dribbling 
basketballs and squeaking sneakers footfalls on the onefifth mile 
track volleys on the tennis courts golf balls driven into a net 
pingpong games and players shouts echo under the high plant 
ceiling 
some nights i call over here and its so loud you cant even 
talk on the phone said cynthia t nemon plant medical services 
coordinator and fitness center director 
domestic companies get the message general motors corp and 
ford motor co plants offer a scattering of exercise rooms and 
aerobics classes chrysler corp is surveying some assembly plant 
workers to see if they want aerobics classes 
kellogg co in battle creek mich offers a healthy 
lifestyle program for employees that includes newsletters and 
reimbursement for participation in fitness activities said dick 
lovell company communications manager 
kellogg opened a fitness center at its corporate headquarters in 
1986 and followed in january with a center at its battle creek 
cereal plant where the exercise bikes rowing machines 
weightlifting equipment jogging track and aerobics room are in 
such demand among the 3200 employees that hours have been extended 
to midnight lovell said 
at flat rock mazdas center is part of an involvement with 
employees similar to that in its japanese plants 
the number of japanese employees at flat rock 600 of the 
plants 3500 eventually will fall to about 100 but the company 
wants us employees to be instilled with japanesestyle team 
spirit 
we were not so much interested in building a recreation center 
for employees its great if they want to use it for that but we 
wanted to emphasize the team concept kricho said we were 
interested in building a facility that would cater to team 
activity 
team activity caught on immediately nemon said intensely 
involved employees formed committees for baseball volleyball 
weight training running martial arts aerobics and golf 
all the committees have established classes and leagues she 
said the employees themselves completely run those activities 
they have 20 different teams in the basketball league 
i worked at jeep before they never had anything like this 
said halstead just out of training as an assembly worker at mazda 
he compared the center favorably with outside programs 
explaining that he and his wife had spent 400 at the y which 
didnt have a place to run 
i cant wait till they get that heavy bag up he said 
kricho said he envisions annual physicals for employees with 
prescriptions for good health habits quitting smoking weight 
control cholesterol reduction and hypertension control 
center activities already go far beyond traditional gymnasium 
fare nemon said including a diet support group and available 
literature on subjects ranging from smoking to personal 
relationships 
kricho said japanese companies view corporate responsibility as 
going beyond a paycheck 
and he said if we are responsible for human beings 
spiritual and mental well being and everything else a fitness 
center becomes a very central ingredient a focal point

these are heady days for light beer 
while overall growth in the beer business has flattened out 
light beer sales remain effervescent they have nearly doubled in 
the past seven years and now account for more than 24 percent of 
the overall beer market 
the major brewers are encouraging the growth by spending nearly 
220 million a year on advertising light beers about a third of 
their total ad budgets according to leading national advertisers 
which tracks such spending 
in the latest indication of the importance brewers attach to the 
segment miller brewing co recently began testing a light version 
of its genuine draft beer which has been on the market for about 
two years 
industry executives and analysts say the nations weight and 
healthconsciousness continues to propel the segments growth 
you can drink the same amount of beer and take in less 
calories what more can one ask out of life said emanuel 
goldman who follows the beer industry for montgomery securities in 
san francisco 
the light beers typically have a third fewer calories than the 
140150 calories in regular beers and slightly less alcohol 
beverage industry analysts say another important ingredient in 
the success of light beers has been the ability of brewers to make 
and market a drink that traditional beer drinkers arent ashamed to 
order 
in the 1960s industry watchers said light beers had been 
pitched mainly as diet drinks for women 
michael bellas president of the research firm beverage 
marketing corp in new york said the country wasnt ready for a 
lowcalorie approach then 
pitching the drink to women may also have alienated some men 
which is something brewers normally try to avoid since men 
reportedly consume about 80 percent of all the beer sold 
robert s weinberg a brewing industry consultant and professor 
of marketing at the john m olin school of business at washington 
university in st louis said another flaw in the light beers of 
the 1960s was taste 
they were horrible and usually died a fast death they didnt 
taste like beer and were poorly marketed he said 
milwaukeebased miller began to turn that around in 1973 when it 
started testing a new light beer under the lite name it bought from 
another brewer 
everything you always wanted in a beer and less was the 
original theme the brewer used former athletes and celebrities to 
sell its beer an approach that it continues to use 15 years later 
the approach infuriated critics who said it encouraged young 
people to drink but it helped miller convince customers that it 
was acceptable for tough guys to drink light beer 
others brewers were skeptical about lites chances and stayed 
out of that end of the market for a few years 
it was the only significant consumer packaged good industry 
where a company could bring out imaginative new products and not 
have competitors follow suit immediately weinberg said 
by the time others woke up miller had a grip on the market that 
it has been slow to yield 
we will never enjoy that kind of competitive advantage 
again admitted miller spokesman bob bertini 
beverage marketing said 451 million barrels of light beer were 
sold last year up 71 percent from the previous year while sales 
of all kinds of beer slipped 02 percent to 1872 million barrels 
there are about 70 light brands 
sales of miller lite were flat at about 193 million barrels 
but it is the secondbest selling beer overall budweiser is no 1 
at about 50 million barrels and holds a 2to1 lead in share of 
the light beer segment 
its main competition comes from bud light from anheuserbusch 
inc of st louis which sold an estimated 86 million barrels last 
year and from coors light from adolph coors co of golden colo 
which sold 79 million barrels 
beverage marketing estimates lite held 428 percent of the light 
segment in 1987 compared with 191 percent for bud light and 175 
percent for coors light 
bud light has grown at a furious pace since its introduction in 
1982 scoring well in consumer surveys with ads that show quirky 
responses to customers who ask for a light without specifying 
the brand and with commercials featuring party animal spuds 
mackenzie 
coors light introduced in 1977 has been advertised as the 
silver bullet that wont slow you down and the right beer 
now last year its sales surpassed those of coors premium beer 
for the first time 
other leading light beers include michelob light at 58 percent 
of the market and natural light at 51 percent from anheuserbusch 
stroh brewery co of detroit has captured about 62 percent of 
the market with two brands old milwaukee light and stroh light 
light beer accounted for 241 percent of overall beer sales in 
1987 up from 131 percent in 1980 can its share growth continue 
weinberg said the increasing incidence of brewers attaching 
their regular brands names to light beers show brewers are taking 
the segment seriously even if they are doing so partly just to get 
more shelf space 
others say as the median age of the population moves higher 
even more people will find themselves worrying about their weight 
thirty percent of the market doesnt seem to be 
unattainable said eric shepard executive editor of the industry 
newsletter beer marketers insights but can it get to 40 percent 
i just dont know
