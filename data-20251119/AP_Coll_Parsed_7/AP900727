a study of the bodys energyproducing 
genes has led a researcher to identify the molecular defect causing 
a form of epilepsy 
its the first epilepsy thats ever been worked out at the 
molecular level said douglas wallace of emory university in 
atlanta he spoke thursday at a geneticists meeting at the jackson 
laboratory in bar harbor 
in a separate study wallace reported that nearly all american 
indians are descendants of a single small band of pioneers who 
walked across the bering strait from asia 15000 to 30000 years 
ago 
the form of epilepsy wallace studied is called myoclonic 
epilepsy and raggedred fiber disease the discovery that it is 
related to a genetic defect in the bodys energyproducing 
machines called mitochondria underscores the importance of these 
little fireplaces in the body wallace said 
he was able to show that this disease which can produce severe 
handicapping muscle spasms is an inherited illness its origin 
until now has been completely unknown wallace said 
although the discovery will not lead immediately to a new 
treatment it is an important step toward that goal he said 
preliminary success has been obtained in treating other 
mitochondrial diseases he said 
in his study of american indians wallace showed that the 
descendants of the pioneers who crossed the bering strait make up 
95 percent of american indians including the mayans incas and 
many others current and former groups across the americas 
the exceptions are the eskimos and aleuts of the arctic rim the 
navajos apaches and a few others who arrived later said wallace 
it was clearly a small migration wallace said he based his 
findings on studies of the genes related to the bodys energy 
production extracted from blood samples from members of three 
different indian groups 
the research on american indians showed that the vast majority 
of american indians descended from four women in that original 
migrating group 
thats a striking finding said michael silverstein an 
anthropologist at the university of chicago who studies american 
indian languages 
if the finding is confirmed silverstein said it significantly 
extends the conclusions about indian origins that can be made using 
language studies 
in march anthropologists met in boulder colo to debate a 
suggestion by joseph greenberg of stanford university that most 
american indian languages derived from one ancestral language 
other researchers have identified as many as 200 linguistic 
groups said greenberg that would suggest there had been many 
separate migrations or that the migrations occurred so long ago 
that the original language had had time to split into many 
different forms 
wallace also is one of the leading authorities on mitochondrial 
genes which are separate from the bodys other genes and are 
passed on to children only by mothers not by fathers 
wallace has linked them to several unusual inherited diseases 
he has also suggested that the accumulation of defects in these 
genes during aging could be a cause of the bodys normal 
degeneration although that hypothesis remains to be examined he 
said 
as we age our mitochondrial activity is declining he said 
organs that depend heavily on energy such as the brain and the 
heart are among the organs that begin to fail in old age he said

a federal probe of mayor david dinkins sale of 
stock to his son has ended without any charges being filed the 
government announced thursday 
the stock transfer was brought to light last year during 
democrat dinkins campaign against former manhattan us attorney 
rudolph giuliani 
dinkins sold 588 shares of stock in inner city cable 
broadcasting co to his son david jr in october 1985 for 
58000 three years earlier he had listed its value at over 1 
million on a financial disclosure form 
us attorney andrew maloney in brooklyn investigated the 
transfer of the stock apparently to see whether it was authentic 
and whether the proper amount of taxes was paid on it 
maloney said the investigation has been completed without the 
filing of criminal charges 
dinkins said of maloneys finding his conclusion speaks for 
itself 
maloney said the results of the investigation have been sent to 
the city department of investigations at the departments request 
the department is probing whether dinkins properly filed city 
financial disclosure forms on the stock transfer also being 
investigated is whether he violated any conflict of interest laws 
by voting as manhattan borough president in 1987 in favor of a 
zoning change for inner city and in june 1989 concerning a transfer 
of a cable franchise to a related company 
of the city probe dinkins said i look forward to a speedy 
resolution of the similar inquiry being conducted by the department 
of investigation 
he added in a written statement until that time i will have 
no further comment

the state labor commissioner created a board of 
inquiry thursday to investigate the tense contract negotiations at 
the daily news 
the action by labor commissioner thomas f hartnett followed the 
certification by the chairman of the state board of mediation 
hezekiah brown that a panel was necessary to interpret the 
situation at the tabloid newspaper 
a board of inquiry under state labor law has the power to 
compel both sides in a labor dispute to state their positions 
while the state cannot force the settlement of a labor dispute the 
board can make recommendations or can be a vehicle for a 
coolingoff period 
we strongly feel that this step is an unnecessary intrusion by 
the government into a private sector matter said john t sloan 
the news vice president for human resources the news is owned by 
the tribune co of chicago 
this is the first time since the labor commissioner was 
empowered to create such panels in 1941 that this step has been 
taken without a strike under way 
hartnett said the board of inquiry may be the only way to head 
off a strike 
the 10 unions at the news under the umbrella of the allied 
printing trades council requested the board because they said they 
werent getting a fair shake in the negotiations over contracts 
that expired march 30 
central to the offers the news has made have been changes in 
work rules that management says are necessary to make the paper 
profitable and enable it to invest in new plants and equipment 
the unions have said the news is bent on provoking a strike and 
wants to shut down the paper or sell it at the expense of the 
workers charges the paper denies 
sloan said the news would have to review its options including 
a possible court challenge to the board

designer claude montana of the lanvin fashion house 
won the coveted golden thimble prize thursday to wrap up five days 
of haute couture winter collection shows 
montana won the prize the french capitals top fashion award 
with 24 votes cast by a jury of journalists second place went to 
the balmain house with nine votes 
it made a sweet revenge for montana whose first couture show 
for lanvin last winter was widely deemed a flop but this time he 
was highly praised for a stronglystructured luxury collection 
shows at the opposite end of the spectrum by hubert de givenchy 
and per spook preceded the vote givenchy showed his talents as a 
master of opulent sophistication while spook took a lighthearted 
more casual approach 
givenchy presented a big collection dedicated to the people 
behind the scenes especially to his head couture assistant 
gilberte thomassin she has been with givenchy since he left 
balenciaga and founded his house about 30 years ago 
the craftsmanship of true couture was evident in a collection of 
beautifully constructed suits dresses and evening wear 
the silhouette was firmly givenchy with wide shoulders over 
slim hips and skirts at wearable length just above the knee 
new details included rounded collars cut away to reveal little 
ascotlike ties on superb silk blouses 
as usual givenchy loved the look of suede in shades like royal 
blue and brown this time he added fillips of python trim a 
favorite with yves saintlaurent as well 
woodchuck trim or white mink sleeves on a dressy black suit 
added surprisingly elegant touches to handsome day wear 
skirt suits in chine or flecked tweed were also big but 
givenchy also threw in straight slim trousers and a few belted day 
dresses in fall shades of autumnleaf yellow or red spruce green 
and brick plus a dash of powder blue raspberry or plum 
he didnt stint on his evening wear featuring asymmetrical 
shimmering lame cocktail dresses with lowered hems at the back to 
fabulous ball gowns 
here is where one can see the skill of backroom artisans not 
only in seamless sewing but in dazzling decor the iridescent 
failles endless patterns of pearls jet beads sparkling mirror 
sequins and other embroidery 
norwegianborn per spook went back to his roots for inspiration 
he laid on a lively winter carnival full of norwegian jacquard 
knits mixed up in duffel coats minis leggings and boots and 
even topping them with stocking caps right out of santas workshop 
a few quilted jackets and crepe de chine gowns were amusingly 
printed with lighthearted spook fashion sketches 
while spook didnt invest in many elaborate evening clothes he 
did show one of the prettiest bridal gowns in town a charming 
fullskirted taffeta confection sprigged with pink forgetmenots 
worn by his newlyarrived russian model masha suvorova 
late wednesday valentino put on a show of elaborate ensembles 
that got to be so pretty they nearly became too much of a good 
thing like an overdose of chocolates 
valentino said he was inspired by artisans work like prismatic 
crystal or the inlays of a fancy l8thcentury cabinetmaker 
the results were often stunning tours de force as in the 
kaleidoscopic satin short evening gown in shades of sapphire 
emerald and peacock blue 
he showed a breathtaking long gown with a multicolored mosaic 
top over a maypoleribbon basque waist flaring into a luminous 
cloud of chiffon in deep turquoise green and siena

the american dental association charged that a 
government report of a patient apparently contracting aids from her 
dentist was premature and could cause undue public alarm 
the centers for disease control reported thursday that a young 
woman who went to have two molars pulled came away infected with 
the virus the first time this is known to have happened in dental 
surgery 
the cdc said that while the possibility of another source of 
infection could not be ruled out all evidence was consistent with 
the patient being infected by her dentist 
we think it is not a totally conclusive case of 
transmission countered dr enid neidle director of scientific 
affairs for the chicagobased ada we are not happy at any report 
that could raise fears on the part of the public that the dental 
office is a place of danger and infection 
the dentist had been diagnosed with aids three months earlier 
and was wearing protective gloves and a mask as recommended the 
cdc said 
we dont know exactly what happened during that procedure 
said harold jaffe deputy director for science in the cdcs aids 
program we have to assume there was some kind of an accident 
that exposed the patient to the dentists blood 
there was no indication of such an accident however the 
patient didnt remember the dentist being cut the dentist didnt 
recall any accidents such as sticking himself with the anesthetic 
needle and the procedure should have been uncomplicated the 
cdc said 
a long investigation found no risk factors for aids in the 
womans past such as intravenous drug abuse or numerous sex 
partners she said she had two sex partners prior to her diagnosis 
both tested negative for the aids virus 
furthermore molecular tests on the dentist and patient led 
investigators to believe their viruses were closely related the 
cdc said 
the case has prompted the government to review its 
recommendations for aids prevention in medical settings 
we will be looking at the guidelines to see if they need to be 
modified to decrease the chance this might happen again jaffe 
said 
paul sathrum program director for the national association of 
people with aids said he feared the report would prompt a new 
round of aids hysteria 
any little thing like this always brings it back to the 
surface he said 
the report came only two days after the cdc published a study in 
the journal of the american medical association that said 
physicians with aids were unlikely to spread the disease to 
patients during surgery 
that study based on a survey of 2160 patients of a tennessee 
doctor with aids found none of the patients whom dr harold 
dennison operated on between 1982 and his 1989 death were believed 
to have contracted the disease during surgery 
an accompanying editorial by dr frank rhame of the university 
of minnesota recommended aidsinfected physicians be allowed to 
perform all kinds of operations except oral and pelvic surgery in 
those types of surgery doctors often cant see the spot where they 
are wielding sharp instruments with which they could cut themselves 
cdc officials thursday stressed there is no reason to believe 
the virus was transmitted just because a dentist with aids came 
close to a patient 
and were certainly not suggesting to people they should be 
afraid to go to their doctors and dentists jaffe said 
the cdc as is its policy did not identify the dentist or the 
patient it did not say when the infection occurred 
two years after her trip to the dentist the woman was diagnosed 
with a rare pneumonia that strikes some aids patients she then 
tested positive for the aids virus 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome damages the bodys immune 
system it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood and from pregnant 
women to their offspring

president fidel castro told a huge rally thursday 
night that president bush has a sick obsession with trying to 
topple his communist government 
neither asleep nor awake can bush forget about cuba castro 
told hundreds of thousands of people massed in revolutionary plaza 
to mark the 37th anniversary of the birth of his movement that took 
power in 1959 
smiling he invited americans to send boats to pick up cubans 
wishing to leave the country his comment came after dozens of 
cubans sought asylum in foreign embassies in recent weeks 
if the yankees decide that they want to receive these poor 
persecuted citizens let them send the boats and the visas he 
said with sarcastic intonation 
it was not clear whether castro was suggesting a renewal of the 
mariel boatlift under that operation 125000 cubans went to 
florida during a fivemonth period in 1980 
despite deepening economic problems and growing international 
isolation castro was on the offensive for most of his twohour 
45minute speech cuban flags adorned buildings and citizens were 
urged by state media to attend the event and the anniversary is a 
national holiday 
castro escalated a dispute with spain he renounced a 25 
million economic cooperation program that spanish authorities 
suspended last week in a conflict with cuba over 18 asylumseekers 
at the spanish embassy in this capital 
the cuban president invited spain and the european community to 
open an office in havana to process applications for cubans who 
wish to emigrate embassies he said should not be used as 
travel agencies 
spain has refused to expel the cubans cuba says they should not 
have been given refuge because they are not being sought by cuban 
authorities the incident has produced harsh public exchanges 
between the two countries 
the cuban president blamed the embassy crisis here on the united 
states according to official news agency reports monitored in 
mexico city dozens of cubans have sought asylum in various foreign 
missions recently 
castro said no cuban who enters an embassy by force will be be 
granted permission to leave the country the official cuban news 
agency prensa latina reported thursday 
in charging bush with having a sick obsession about cuba 
castro cited what he said were a number of hostile acts by the 
united states against cuba 
he said the campaign included the initiation of voice of america 
television broadcasts to cuba and threatening military manuevers 
castro also criticized bush for asserting at the houston summit 
this month that the united states would withhold aid to the soviet 
union until kremlin economic and military aid to cuba is cut off 
citing the recent testimony of a cuban dissident castro accused 
the united states of instigating the wave of embassy breakins by 
asylumseekers on july 9 
the allegations were first aired a week ago and drew a flat 
denial from the us diplomatic mission here 
an official statement issued tuesday said no us official 
has ever encouraged or ever talked about cubans taking asylum in 
foreign embassies 
late thursday in washington the state department had no 
official reaction to castros remarks saying there likely would be 
a response friday after the speech is analyzed 
castro said the united states was also to blame for the 
situation at the embassies because it has not fulfilled a 1984 
agreement designed to facilitate cuban emigration to the united 
states us officials here said that 10000 visa applications from 
cubans had been processed since early 1988 it denied cuban charges 
that the united states has not fulfilled the agreement 
castro offered a daybyday account of the asylum issue some 
observers have speculated that hordes of cubans might seek shelter 
in embassies possibly destabilizing the regime which took power 
in 1959 
but the situation in the embassies appears to have stabilized in 
recent days there are 18 cubans being sheltered in the spanish 
embassy and four at the italian ambassadors residence 
three cubans who entered the swiss embassy last weekend departed 
voluntarily on wednesday 
castro normally makes his july 26 address in a provincial 
capital but decided this year to speak in havana the event marks 
the day in 1953 when castro led an attack on a military barracks in 
eastern cuba 
earlier thursday the state department in washington issued this 
statement on the anniversary 
tragically the revolutions promises with castros assumption 
of power in 1959 were betrayed there is little or no freedom of 
expression in cuba 
the regime has just announced that it will no longer permit 
the international committee of the red cross to visit cuban 
prisoners three decades after the revolution the cuban people are 
paying a high price for castros devotion to the discredited

the justice department is recommending that 
the northrop corp which has pleaded guilty to fraud charges be 
barred by the air force from building weapons for the nations 
military agency documents say 
in a series of memorandums from march to june of this year the 
department sharply criticized the maker of the b2 bomber and parts 
for the mx nuclear missile for failing to conduct critical tests on 
nuclear weapons systems 
if any case cries out for debarment this is the case said 
a march 13 memo from the us attorneys office in los angeles to 
o kevin vincent in the air forces general counsel office at the 
pentagon 
if ever the american people deserve to be protected from the 
type of reckless and potentially lifethreatening conduct this is 
it the memo said 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations today planned to question pentagon acquisition czar 
john betti justice department witnesses and a former northrop 
auditor as part of its broader examination of the company 
northrop pleaded guilty in february to 34 fraud charges and 
agreed to pay 17 million in fines the largest criminal fine ever 
imposed on a defense contractor 
in a copy of testimony obtained by the associated press on 
thursday a justice department official said northrop pressured the 
navy and air force to change contract specifications in a way that 
seriously damaged a fraud investigation of the company 
the deputy assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal 
division mark m richard was expected to detail the departments 
inquiry of northrop that led to the companys guilty plea 
in other documents the government reacted angrily to the 
manufacturers actions following its february plea 
in an april 2 memo us attorney robert brosio and assistant 
us attorney william f fahey noted little if any remorse or 
willingness by northrop to admit that it has had any serious 
problems with its management or critical weapons systems 
on april 26 the government wrote that northrop appears to 
warrant debarment because it fails to recognize or admit its fault 
it is being investigated for the same type of serious misconduct in 
other production divisions and there is no reason to believe this 
illegal conduct will not continue in the future 
the hearing comes one week after the chairman of the house 
panel rep john dingell dmich released portions of a justice 
department memorandum that said the agency was unable to pursue a 
fraud claim against northrop because the government had known the 
company submitted false information 
the memo said northrop which is located in california 
submitted inaccurate cost and scheduling data to the air force on 
the program to build the stealth aircraft 
richard in his justice department testimony said successful 
attempts by northrop to modify contract requirements during the 
investigation which northrop knew were the subject of our 
investigation were highly damaging to our ability to prosecute 
northrops efforts continued after it was indicted richard 
said 
the inquiry into practices at northrop began in early 1987 when 
a test technician working on nuclear airlaunched cruise missiles 
and the marine corps harrier av8b jet project told the air force 
that northrop was cheating on critical tests according to the 
testimony 
after accumulating documents and other evidence the air force 
brought the case to the us attorney in los angeles the 
subsequent inquiry by the justice department found that hundreds 
of guidance units for the cruise missile had improper testing and 
that northrop had generated hundreds of false reports 
similarly on the much smaller harrier jet program dozens of 
units had been improperly tested and the results covered up by 
northrop employees 
the us attorney obtained the first indictment in april 1989 
part of the charges against the company centered on evidence that 
northrop knew since at least 1983 that it was using the wrong fluid 
in the cruise missiles gyroscopes 
northrop confirmed these conclusions in 1982 1983 and 1987 
but never once disclosed the findings to the air force or to 
boeing the prime contractor the justice department said in its 
testimony 
in 1988 northrop sought waivers on an air force and navy 
requirement that the equipment be able to function at minus65 
degrees fahrenheit the company managed to persuade the navy to 
change its contract to minus40 degrees by threatening to hold up 
delivery on parts for the av8b 
the navy agreed to this change without demanding any 
consideration and without notifying our investigators the 
department said 
a northrop spokesman in los angeles tony cantafio said of the 
departments temperature accusations they dismissed the charges 
inside the courtroom and now theyre trying to put us on trial 
outside the courtroom

attorneys for a retired general and a cialinked 
air company sought to undermine the credibility of a contra supply 
plane crewman who has sued them over the 1986 crash that helped 
unravel the irancontra affair 
eugene hasenfus who kicked bales out of planes in the 
clandestine contra supply effort testified thursday in a federal 
lawsuit he filed along with the family of copilot wallace sawyer 
jr who was killed in the sandinista rocket attack on the contra 
supply plane in nicaragua 
hasenfus alleges that richard secord a retired air force major 
general and miamibased southern air transport misled the crew and 
failed to supply adequate safety equipment 
hasenfus 49 also claimed he was abandoned after the oct 5 
1986 crash which he survived only to be captured and tried 
subsequently by nicaraguas former sandinista government 
under questioning from secords attorney thomas spencer 
hasenfus admitted he had received some money after the crash 
6000 in a brown bag given to his wife by a man who said this 
is from the boys 
hasenfus testified he had joined the contra supply effort out of 
patriotism thinking he was working for southern air on behalf of 
the us government fighting communism in central america 
hasenfus was sentenced to 30 years in prison by the sandinistas 
but they released him after three months in a humanitarian gesture 
southern air attorney robert beckman emphasized that hasenfus 
was an independent contractor not an employee and that either he 
or the company could have terminated the arrangement at any time 
i stopped the day i was shot down hasenfus responded i 
dont believe i terminated myself 
beckman forced hasenfus to show that his pay drafts tax returns 
and even unemployment compensation claim all reflected the name of 
corporate air services not southern air hasenfus has called 
corporate air services a front for southern air 
beckman also sought to show hasenfus had violated a secrecy 
agreement he signed by selling his story to cbs for 10000 
hasenfus said all secrecy was already blown by congress when he 
sold his story which has not yet been made public 
hasenfus attorneys say they are still calculating damages 
including expenses caused by the crash and lost income along with 
emotional distress on wednesday they submitted preliminary figures 
showing actual damages of about 24 million for sawyers family 
and about 1 million for hasenfus 
hasenfus now a construction worker in marinette wis and a 
veteran of ciaowned air america flights during the vietnam war 
said he joined the contra supply operation in july 1986 
the shooting down of his c123 and the revelation the following 
month of us arms sales to iran led to the irancontra affair in 
which a network of private and public figures were revealed to have 
transferred cash from the arms sales and other sources to illegally 
aid the contras 
secord pleaded guilty nov 8 1989 to lying to congressional 
investigators when he said he wasnt aware of any money that went 
to norths benefit from the maze of companies he used in the 
irancontra affair secord was sentenced to two years probation

in the shadow of a mausoleum that until 
recently housed the body of communist bulgarias founder 
prodemocracy protesters have erected a tent city to press for a 
quicker break with the stalinist past 
while the mausoleum still stands the embalmed body of georgi 
dimitrov was whisked away one night for cremation and burial in a 
cemetery 
the soldiers who served as honor guards outside the former 
shrine have been replaced by the mushrooming tent city of 
antigovernment protesters a gathering unthinkable even a year ago 
at least 270 people are living in more than 100 tents they 
range from young to old but most are under 40 
for residents of the selfproclaimed city of truth 
democracy has not made nearly enough inroads in the small balkan 
country now deeply polarized by the victory of the socialist party 
the former communists in junes free elections 
the elections followed the ouster last november of hardline 
leader todor zhivkov 
while many bulgarians have fled the sweltering metropolis for 
the black sea coast or the cool mountains tent city residents seem 
determined to spend the summer camped out in sofia they have 
pledged to leave only when those they see as perpetrators of 
communist sins are brought to account 
the protesters get water from a faucet in a yard nearby and 
carry buckets back to the tents food is brought by relatives or 
friends or purchased by the campers in nearby shops 
visitors from rural bulgaria gaze in wonder at the encampment 
around the oncehallowed mausoleum and the nearby socialist party 
headquarters for them it is hard to believe that icons revered 
for 45 years could fall at least so fast 
a symbolic pile of trash is the ultimate insult to the old 
system hundreds of old communist publications speeches and rule 
books are strewn around an old car plastered with defaced portraits 
of stalin lenin and other former official heroes 
bolstered by their success in securing the resignation of 
president petar mladenov earlier this month the campers showed 
little concern on monday when the government told local authorities 
to halt ethnic and political unrest 
whats to fear asked evgeni genchev a 32yearold sofia 
doctor i dont think anything really dangerous can happen to us 
but i think something really dangerous can happen to them you know 
what happened in romania 
he was referring to western criticism and a halt in aid after 
romania cracked down on antigovernment protesters in june 
bulgarias leaders really need western economic help we dont 
want this help to be given to this kind of government they are 
lying all the time genchev said 
discontent with bulgarias government and with political 
opposition groups is simmering 
sofia residents daily deplore the parliamentary stalemate and 
procedural haggling that so far have blocked the election of anyone 
to replace mladenov as president he resigned july 6 over a 
controversy about using force against antigovernment protests 
a new government cannot be formed until a president is chosen 
and bulgarians and western diplomats fear lawmakers are courting 
danger by failing to agree on leaders to fight a worsening economic 
crisis 
bulgaria has stopped paying capital and interest on its foreign 
debt of nearly 11 billion any exportable item is being sent 
abroad resulting in growing food shortages prices are expected to 
rise soon in an attempt to fill state coffers 
on tuesday hundreds of jeering demonstrators and dozens of 
honking cars blocked traffic outside the socialist party 
headquarters in support of a trade union threat to stage a general 
strike if the economic crisis is not tackled soon 
bulgarian nationalists meanwhile have shut down services in 
areas of the country heavily populated by members of the 1 
millionmember ethnic turkish minority 
the nationalists are angry that ethnic turks who suffered a 
brutal assimilation campaign under former communist leader zhivkov 
were allowed to win representation in parliament where their 
movement is the thirdstrongest faction 
the city of truth provides citizens not only with 
instruction in the relatively new art of peaceful protest but with 
comic relief 
one day this week two people donned masks of zhivkov and 
current socialist party leader alexander lilov and clowned around 
embracing mocking lilovs renunciation of zhivkovs 35year rule 
a sign on a nearby tent taunted british publisher robert 
maxwell who recently has purchased a soccer team a large share in 
a printing house and other concerns in bulgaria 
mr maxwell are you going to buy us the sign said

an apologetic rep barney frank reprimanded 
by the house says his worst ethics offense was unintentional and 
stemmed from his desire to conceal my homosexuality during his 
relationship with a male prostitute 
the house voted 40818 to reprimand frank on thursday rejecting 
conservative republican efforts to censure or expel him 
but the ethics committee report mentions no link between franks 
thenunknown homosexuality and a misleading memo he wrote in 1986 
to help prostitute stephen l gobie who then was on probation for 
sex and drug convictions 
and rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the ethics 
committee said that franks concern over revealing his sexual 
preference does not however justify his making misleading 
statements 
frank paid gobie 80 for sex in 1985 then hired him as a 
personal assistant with his own money gobies allegations touched 
off the ethics investigation last september 
the house after three hours of sometimes heated floor debate 
accepted the ethics committees recommendation that frank be 
reprimanded the mildest punishment available the charges 
centered on the memo and on 33 parking tickets some of them 
accumulated by gobie that frank had fixed 
by wide margins the house rejected republican proposals to 
censure or expel the fiveterm liberal democrat from massachusetts 
frank 50 said he hopes he can put the ethics controversy 
behind him and looks forward to wading back into legislative issues 
next week 
this is a part of my life frank told reporters its a 
part of which i am not particularly proud 
speaking slowly but with little visible emotion from the well of 
the house frank told his colleagues that he accepted the committee 
report and took full responsibility for his actions 
i am here to apologize to my colleagues to this institution 
to those around me frank said 
frank watched much of the debate flanked by fellow members of 
the massachusetts congressional delegation many colleagues 
approached him to shake hands or pat him on the shoulder but few 
rose to defend him during the debate 
frank said the april 16 1986 memo was obviously the more 
serious of the two offenses cited by the ethics committee he said 
he wrote it for gobie after the prostitute asked for franks help 
in blocking extension of gobies probation on drug and sex 
convictions 
i did in that memorandum misrepresent the facts because it 
was necessary to conceal my homosexuality he said 
it was a year later in june 1987 that frank first stated 
publicly that he is gay 
under his congressional letterhead frank wrote a onepage 
document saying he met gobie through mutual friends and asserting 
that gobie was obeying the law the committee said both those 
statements were false 
frank passed the memo on to a friend identified only as a 
virginia attorney unknown to frank the attorney sent the memo to 
a prosecutor overseeing gobies probation 
it was just a sloppy thing frank said at a news conference 
later thursday a reprimand was the appropriate punishment frank 
said because of the unintentional nature of the transgression 
but dixon said the fact does remain that the congressman 
prepared a document with statements that he knew to be misleading 
these acknowledged misleading statements could be perceived as an 
attempt to apply political influence affecting the administration 
of mr gobies probation 
yes the committee took into consideration franks explanation 
that in large part these misleading statements were derived from 
his desire to maintain confidentiality of his private activities 
dixon continued 
the session opened with conservative republican rep william 
dannemeyer of california proposing that frank be expelled 
dannemeyer challenged the ethics committees conclusion that frank 
was unaware gobie was running a prostitution ring out of the 
congressmans capitol hill apartment 
but dixon rose and called dannemeyers statements garbage 
and the house voted down the expulsion proposal 39038 
house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia then proposed censure a 
punishment that would have stripped frank of a judiciary 
subcommittee chairmanship but ethics committee members of both 
parties said censure was excessive and urged the house not to 
politicize the debate the house rejected the censure proposal

if texas were a country it would rank ahead 
of such industrial nations as britain france and italy as a source 
of carbon dioxide emissions an environmental group says 
the natural resources defense council reported thursday that 
several states are among the worlds top producers of the gases 
blamed for the greenhouse effect said to be warming the entire 
planet 
this means state governments can make a major contribution to 
fighting global warming it said 
the 10 states with the highest emissions account for half the 
total carbon dioxide put into the air in the united states the 
nrdc study said those states together would rank third in the 
world as a source of carbon dioxide 
texas alone would rank seventh behind the united states the 
soviet union china japan west germany and india 
a buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is one of the 
chief reasons scientists expect global temperatures to increase in 
coming decades with possibly disastrous consequences 
the nrdc a public interest environmental organization said its 
study the statehouse effect state policies to cool the 
greenhouse was timed to influence the annual meeting of the 
national governors association next week in mobile ala ideas for 
fighting global warming are on the agenda 
daniel a lashof senior project scientist at the council 
recalled at a news conference that president bush promised during 
his 1988 campaign to counter the greenhouse effect with a white 
house effect 
so far all weve gotten is the whitewash effect lashof 
said but he said state governments can step in to take the lead 
environmentalists say the bush administration is blocking 
international efforts to force cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide 
and other gases blamed for global warming while calling for 
further study 
other industrial countries such as west germany canada 
britain and france have pledged to stabilize or reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions and have pressured the united states to take 
similar actions 
the principal finding of our report is that states are big 
players when it comes to global warming lashof said 
the study recommends that state governments promote energy 
efficiency with tough building codes and appliance standards call 
a moratorium on investing in new coalfired power plants encourage 
utilities to invest in energy efficiency reduce harvesting of 
state forests and plant more trees 
the good news is that states can do a heck of a lot in 
reducing their carbon dioxide emissions said robert watson an 
expert on energy efficiency at the nrdc 
energysaving policies he said generally are cheaper than 
building new power plants and create more jobs within the state 
the study based on 1988 figures put texas at the top of the 
statebystate list in carbon dioxide emissions with 553 million 
metric tons well ahead of californias 310 million metric tons 
texas put out more carbon dioxide than britain italy or canada 
while california ranked ahead of france and mexico 
the rest of the top 10 emitting states were pennsylvania ohio 
indiana illinois louisiana new york michigan and florida 
watson said california new york and florida although they rank 
in the top 10 because of their large populations were leaders in 
promoting energy efficiency and scored well on per capita emissions 
texas is a hopeless cause watson said theres something 
of a frontier mentality people are very resistant to adopting 
energy standards because they dont like to be told what to do 
they dont want to do it theyre not going to do it even though 
its probably costing their citizens billions of dollars and 
thousands of jobs 
texas was eighthhighest in per capita carbon dioxide emissions 
as well as highest in total emissions per capita emissions were 
highest in wyoming but watson said the result could be misleading 
wyoming has a very small population and it has a coal 
production industry and some coalfired power plants whose 
electricity is probably consumed out of state wyoming is something 
of an anomaly he said it may also be inefficient but its 
hard to tell 
for its study the nrdc analyzed national carbon dioxide data 
from the oak ridge tenn national laboratory and calculated 
statebystate figures based on energy consumption data from the 
us department of energy emissions from power production for 
electricity consumed in other states are included in the exporting 
states figures rather than that of the importing state

a bill with strong support from groups often 
in disagreement would negate the impact of a supreme court decision 
that sponsors say undermines religious freedom 
the bill would restore a requirement that only a compelling 
state interest could be used to deny a religious practice rather 
than simply the fact that the practice violates another law 
on thursday rep stephen j solarz dny introduced 
legislation that would prohibit government from taking any action 
that impedes religious freedom unless it could be justified for the 
protection of society 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel 
plans to introduce similar legislation next week said spokesman 
ken drexler 
supporters of the bill say the supreme court in a decision 
april 17 put the first amendments guarantee of religious freedom 
in last place by saying any general law takes precedence

employment benefits to two drug counselors who were fired for using 
peyote a hallucinogenic drug derived from cactus plants in an 
american indian religious ceremony 
writing for the majority justice antonin scalia said an 
individuals religious beliefs do not excuse him from compliance 
with an otherwise valid law 
with the stroke of a pen the supreme court virtually removed 
religious freedom our first freedom from the bill of rights 
solarz said in announcing the bill 
the house bill has 32 cosponsors who run the political gamut

researchers have been unable to definitively link 
fallout from atomic explosions in nevada during the 1950s to the 
higher than normal leukemia rate in neighboring utah although a 
new study does suggest a link 
weapons tests in nevada by the old us atomic energy commission 
may have caused the higher cancer rate in the neighboring state 
but the evidence is weak according to a study conducted by 
university of utah researchers to be published in next weeks 
journal of the american medical association 
the excess of acute leukemias in southwestern utah is probably 
not due to chance and may be attributable to fallout radiation 
however the estimated number of cases attributable to fallout in 
this region is small and these cases are indistinguishable from 
other factors the study said 
if a direct relationship could have been established between 
fallout and leukemias there would also have been a substantial 
number of cases attributable to fallout in the rest of the state 
because of its much larger population the study said but no 
such increased risk was found outside southwest utah it said 
there was an excess of acute leukemia cases but it was not 
statistically significant concluded dr joseph l lyon one of 
the researchers with the university of utahs department of family 
and preventative medicine 
the us house last month approved a bill creating a 100 
million trust fund to compensate those living downwind from the 
nevada test site for alleged radiation injuries up to 1300 
alleged fallout victims could collect up to 50000 each under the 
legislation now being considered by the senate 
more than 100 atomic bombs were set off above ground in nevada 
between 1951 and 1958 researchers said fallout from those blasts 
spread across southwestern utah in one county the average 
resident was exposed to nearly 30 times as much radiation as 
occurred naturally researchers found 
but because leukemia leaves no traces as to its source it was 
impossible to determine whether individual deaths were caused by 
exposure to fallout lyon said thursday 
you cant say this leukemia was caused by smoking this one 
was caused by radiation theres nothing in the disease that says 
what it was caused by you cant sort out the random cases from 
those involving fallout lyon said 
researchers analyzed more than 6500 deaths in utah between 1952 
and 1981 for the 68 million federally funded study they 
confined their analysis to members of the mormon church because 
church records could be used to determine who had died and moved 
into or out of the area during the testing period 
earlier studies indicated the states leukemia rate was 145 
times higher than that across the country and 245 times higher 
for children but those studies didnt directly link that higher 
rate to radiation fallout lyon said 
the study did show an apparently significant link between 
fallout and leukemia among those who were younger than 20 when they 
were exposed to the radiation 
in washington county where the highest radiation levels were 
recorded there were 17 leukemia deaths five were among people 
younger than 20 when exposed making them nearly eight times more 
likely to die from acute leukemia than others their age 
but researchers said that study sample was too small to be 
significant

the battle over senate election campaign 
funding is headed for a showdown next week with republicans 
refusing to guarantee a vote and democrats threatening to delay the 
august recess 
a lastditch approach to reach an accord fizzled thursday as 
democrats rejected a republican proposal to put a ceiling only on 
large outofstate contributions that go directly to a campaign 
republicans retained their option to deny majority democrats a 
final vote on the bill itself but disavowed any intent to mount a 
filibuster against it as they did successfully two years ago 
i think we ought to start the bill first and lets have some 
amendments said gop leader bob dole of kansas telling reporters 
he was unwilling for now to enter into an agreement with democrats 
specifying when a vote on final passage would occur 
democratic leader george mitchell of maine threatened to delay 
the beginning of senates scheduled summer recess beyond aug 3 or 
aug 10 if the campaign finance measure is not disposed of by then 
any delays whatever the intention of the delays will serve 
only to delay the onset of the august recess mitchell said we 
are simply going to take this bill up and complete action on it 
in a letter to mitchell on wednesday dole offered for the first 
time to accept the concept of a flexible ceiling on how much a 
candidate can raise from wealthy outofstate contributors 
the republican proposal would cut in half from 1000 to 500 
how much an individual can give each to the primary and general 
election campaigns of a candidate living in another state and place 
an unspecified ceiling on how much candidates could raise in 
contributions of above 250 from out of state 
it seems to us that weve come quite a distance dole said 
calling the proposal a dealmaker issue 
democrats however said the offer is rife with so many 
loopholes that campaign spending would continue to skyrocket 
without an absolute ceiling on the total amount of money a 
candidate can raise from all sources 
it exempts any and all money raised in the state and most 
money raised out of state mitchell said it is the classic 
example of the exception swallowing the rule 
the democratic bill would limit spending on senate races to 
about 2 million for both the primary and general elections in 
small states to and to 11 million in large states like california 
and new york 
sen david boren dokla said the gop proposal would encourage 
the further development of directmail campaigns run by special 
interest organizations 
millions of dollars could be raised this way especially by 
incumbents boren said the proposal wont stop by the money 
chase but encourage special interest politics thats the last 
thing we should be doing

president fidel castro says the united states is 
stepping up efforts to bring down his communist government as part 
of a sick obsession president bush has about the island nation 
when bush goes to eat breakfast he finds cuba in his coffee 
in his water in his bread castro said thursday night in a 
speech on the 37th anniversary of the beginning of his 
revolutionary movement that came to power in 1959 
hundreds of thousands of cubans massed on revolutionary plaza to 
hear castro whose government faces serious economic problems and 
growing isolation following the fall of communism in eastern europe 
cubas foreign relations have become even more tense in recent 
weeks because of dozens of asylumseekers who have sought refuge in 
foreign embassies in havana 
a smiling castro invited americans to send boats to cuba to pick 
up those wishing to leave but it was not clear whether he was 
suggesting a renewal of the mariel boatlift under that operation 
125000 cubans went to florida during a fivemonth period in 1980 
if the yankees decide and they want to receive these poor 
persecuted citizens let them send the boats and the visas he 
said sarcastically 
castro was on the offensive during most of his twohour 
45minute speech and he appeared intent on rallying patriotic 
sentiment against spain and the united states the foreign powers 
that once dominated cuba 
the anniversary of castros revolution is a national holiday 
and state media urged citizens to attend the rally 
castro accused spain of collaborating with us imperialist 
aims and he announced the cancellation of a 25 million spanish 
economic aid program spain suspended the program last week after 
cuba took a hard line on cubans who entered the spanish embassy 
seeking political asylum 
with the united states now on friendly terms with the soviet 
union cubas chief benefactor castro said bush has become 
increasingly aggressive toward the caribbean island nation of about 
105 million people off florida 
he cited the start of a voice of america television broadcast to 
cuba last march as well as subsequent us military maneuvers near 
the cuban coast 
in addition he noted that bush has linked us aid to the 
soviet union to a suspension of soviet economic and military aid to 
cuba 
see how the sick obsession of bush goes castro asked 
neither asleep nor awakes does he forget about cuba he 
said it is a shame for the world 
cubans have sought refuge in foreign embassies since july 9 and 
castro said the united states has encouraged the actions he cited 
the testimony of a cuban dissident who said recently the alleged 
us activities began last march 
the us diplomatic mission has denied the claims 
the state department in washington had no official reaction to 
castros remarks late thursday saying there likely would be a 
response today after the speech is analyzed 
castro also said the united states was indirectly encouraging 
disaffected cubans to seek asylum by refusing to live up to the 
terms of a 1984 immigration agreement between the countries 
us officials also have denied that charge and said that 10000 
visa applications have been processed since early 1988 
the spanish embassy holds the most asylymseekers 18 spain has 
said they will not be expelled 
there are four cubans at the italian ambassadors residence 
three cubans who entered the swiss embassy last weekend departed 
voluntarily on wednesday 
castro reiterated thursday night that his government will never 
let the asylumseekers leave the country 
he said if a cuban wants to emigrate he should go through 
normal procedures rather than try to use foreign embassies as a 
travel agency 
castro invited spain and the european community to open offices 
to allow disgruntled cubans to apply for emigration visas and he 
invited americans to send boats to pick up cubans who want to leave 
touching on economic issues castro said that oil deliveries 
from the soviet union were 50 percent below what had been 
contracted for but he said the soviet government was doing 
everything possible to fulfill its obligations 
castro has warned his countrymen that harsh austerity measures 
will have to be imposed if the soviets stop sending 13 million tons 
of oil a year to cuba 
compared with the anniversary a year ago the mood today is far 
more uncertain many cubans say they cant recall when food 
supplies have been more meager 
for all his problems castros rule still is without serious 
challenge he continues to have a strong base of support and 
representatives of the small dissident community are either in 
prison or silent

some mail that now gets delivered the next day 
will take a day longer starting this weekend 
postmaster general anthony frank announced thursday he will go 
ahead with selective cutbacks in overnight delivery service 
originally announced last january despite opposition from the 
independent postal rate commission 
the commission in an opinion issued thursday said it opposed 
the reductions nationally although cutbacks in delivery goals 
might be justified locally in some areas 
the commission criticized the postal service for failing to 
estimate how it might save or customers might lose with the change 
it also said the market research on which the service based its 
decision accurately measured what customers want 
a national list of the changes was not issued by the postal 
service officials said information on cutbacks was being made 
public locally in the areas to be affected 
we have concluded that commission opposition does not 
warrant delaying our scheduled saturday implementation of changes 
in overnight delivery areas postmaster general anthony m frank 
said 
while the postal service is required to seek the opinion of the 
rate commission when it wants to make such delivery changes it is 
not legally bound to abide by that opinion 
frank announced last january that the post office planned to 
tighten up the areas scheduled for regular overnight delivery to 
provide what it hopes will be more consistent service nationwide 
the program called for concentrating resources in the busier 
regions 
local mail is not affected by the changes which officials said 
will affect areas where there is only a small volume of mail moving 
between communities but where current standards call for overnight 
service 
currently 555 percent of all first class mail is designated for 
overnight delivery frank said that the new standard will reduce 
that to 507 percent 
i consider these changes to be minimal in light of the many 
changes in transportation networks increases in mail volume and 
shifts in population that have occurred since the standards were 
last examined more than a decade ago said frank 
nonetheless the plan drew opposition from the beginning 
particularly in light of the fact it was first reported at about 
the same time the post office announced that it would seek to raise 
rates next year 
implementation of the changes was pushed back from february to 
june and then to the end of july

congress is moving toward a vote to limit 
cable television rates and give a boost to competitors such as 
satellite broadcasters 
the house energy and commerce committee on thursday approved a 
cable regulation bill on a voice vote and sent it on to the house 
a similar bill is pending in the senate 
the federal communications commission meanwhile recommended in 
a report to congress against reregulating cable rates or services 
the industry was deregulated in 1984 but said steps should be 
taken to encourage competition 
the bill approved by the house committee would require the fcc 
to set a price cap on a lowcost basic tier of channels that 
would include overtheair broadcasters and public educational and 
government channels 
the fcc also would be empowered to go after bad actor cable 
systems and roll back their charges to customers for cableowned 
services such as mtv cnn and espn if it found the prices to be 
unreasonable pay channels such as disney hbo and showtime would 
not be affected 
since 1984 the number of cable subscribers has soared as have 
complaints about high prices and shoddy service lawmakers have 
said they wanted to assure the health of the cable industry as 
well as its competitors while cracking down on cable renegades 
some cable operators have betrayed the trust placed in them by 
the congress in 1984 said rep edward markey dmass one of 
the house bills principal sponsors this measure would rein in 
these sorts of renegades he said 
the congressional watchdog agency the general accounting 
office has reported that from 1987 through 1989 rates for the 
lowestpriced cable service increased by 43 percent from an 
average 1114 to 1595 per subscriber while the average number 
of basic channels increased from 24 to 31 
rep billy tauzin dla noted that the house bill does not 
roll back cable rates and does not undo some of the damage 
done cable operators still will be allowed to raise rates 
moderately he said 
he and other committee members said increased competition 
particularly from satellite broadcasters and perhaps telephone 
companies was the best way to assure that cable operators would 
not abuse customers 
the house bill also would prohibit cable programmers that are 
owned by cable systems from unreasonably refusing to deal with 
competitors backyard dish owners also would get guaranteed access 
to cable programs 
the bill also would 
allow exclusive contracts between cable programmers and 
distributors as long as such agreements do not significantly 
impede competition 
require cable systems to carry public and commercial stations 
mainly on their existing channel assignments 
require the fcc to establish minimum service standards 
require the fcc to study whether to limit the number of cable 
systems one company may own or limit cable operator ownership of 
programming 
quick passage is predicted in both chambers but administration 
officials have recommended that president bush veto such a measure 
james mooney president of the national cable television 
association said the house bill went way too far in handing out 
regulatory benefits to competitors we dont support it

a house armed services subcommittee is 
proposing a cut in the nations armed forces of 129000 troops 
with the army and air force taking the deepest reductions in the 
fiscal 1991 military budget 
the panel on military personnel and compensation on thursday 
approved a cut in the army of 68500 and the air force of 37000 
the reductions would slash 50000 soldiers from the current active 
duty forces in europe a congressional decision based on the 
lessening soviet threat 
reductions for the navy would total 20000 while the marine 
corps would lose about 4000 spots 
consistent with the house budget resolution approved on may 1 
the armed services committee is drawing up a military budget of 
283 billion 24 billion less than president bush had sought in 
january 
the action by the subcommittee was the first of several steps 
taken by various armed services panels leading up to the full 
committees crafting of a 1991 defense bill on tuesday 
the total troop reduction from the nearly 21 million troops is 
slightly higher than the 100000 approved by the senate armed 
services committee in its version of the defense bill and nearly 
four times the total of 38000 in the presidents proposed budget 
in other developments the subcommittee on military 
installations agreed to prohibit spending any defense funds on 
moving the 401st tactical wing from torrejon de ardoz spain to 
crotone italy or any other location overseas subcommittee 
chairwoman patricia schroeder dcolo said 
defense money could be used however to move the 72 f16 jet 
fighters from torrejon de ardoz to any site in the united states 
the panel also agreed to delay closing military bases while 
requiring defense secretary dick cheney to come up with an 
acceptable proposal to congress likely a commission on how 
installations can be shut down 
democrats had criticized cheneys proposed list in january as 
partisan in its selections 
the panel on seapower and strategic and critical materials 
agreed to bushs request for five ddg51 navy destroyers at a cost 
of 36 billion and his proposal of 12 billion for the 18th 
trident missilelaunching submarine 
but the panel agreed to only one of the two ssn21 seawolf 
attack submarines president bush had sought in the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 
the seapower subcommittee was forced to cut 3 billion from the 
presidents original request of 161 billion 
on the contentious issue of strategic home porting of naval 
vessels the subcommittee failed to approve a measure that would 
have directed navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii to close the 
home port in staten island ny and impose a moratorium on 
construction at five other home ports 
the subcommittee expressed concern about acting on the issue 
before cheney completes his review of military installations 
worldwide 
among those facilities are planned home ports in everett wash 
ingleside texas pascagoula miss mobile ala and pensacola 
fla 
the panel left a final decision on the home porting issue to the 
full armed services committee 
behind closed doors the panel agreed to one of the ssn21 
seawolf attack submarines the navy had planned to buy two of the 
nuclear boats in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 at a total cost 
of 23 billion 
the panels action came two days after the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress recommended that 
congress slow down the 44 billion submarine program because 15 of 
the costly vessels will be under contract before critical testing 
on the lead ship has been completed 
the first submarine designed by the newport news shipbuilding 
co of virginia and the electric boat division of general 
dynamics in connecticut is estimated at 19 billion 
the navy expects the cost of subsequent submarines to decline 
averaging around 1 billion

congress is close to making major changes in 
the way government and industry deal with oil spills since 
negotiators agreed on a bill creating a 1 billion federal oil 
spill cleanup fund 
a house and senate conference committee approved legislation 
thursday that would significantly increase oil shippers liability 
for spills create the cleanup fund and require that most tankers 
have double hulls within 20 years 
the package must still go back to the house and senate but 
supporters predicted final approval before the august congressional 
recess 
president bush is expected to sign the measure 
approval of the compromise bill came 16 months after the exxon 
valdez tanker ran aground in alaskas prince william sound and 
spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil along the states 
coastline it was the nations worst oil spill and prompted demands 
for tougher federal requirements on oil shippers and better 
preparation for responding to spills 
under the bill shippers would be liable for up to 1200 per 
gross ton of the tanker instead of the current ceiling of 150 per 
gross ton 
as an example a tanker the size of the exxon valdez under the 
new requirements would be liable to up to 115 million with 
unlimited liability if gross negligence is found to be involved 
under current law such a tanker would face only 15 million in 
legal liability 
exxon already has spent an estimated 2 billion in cleanup 
efforts as a result of the march 24 1989 spill 
other major provisions in the compromise legislation include 
creation of a 1 billion oil spill response and cleanup fund 
with the money coming from a 5centabarrel fee on both domestic 
and imported oil the fee can be used for immediate cleanup 
requirements as well as compensating for damages beyond what 
shippers are required to pay under the liability provision 
a requirement that all new tankers have double hulls and that 
most of the existing tankers be retrofitted with double hulls or 
taken out of service over the next 20 years a small number of 
tankers will be given until 2015 to have double hulls 
the coast guard has estimated that if the exxon valdez had been 
double hulled much of the 11 million gallons of oil that spilled 
into prince william sound might have been contained 
formation of regional response teams within the coast guard to 
deal with oil spills and a national response center where computers 
will hold lists of personnel and equipment that can be called upon 
after a major spill 
the legislation also calls for increased research on oil 
pollution control and requires the government to check driving 
records for alcoholrelated offenses before issuing licenses to 
operate an oil tanker 
in a stark reminder of the exxon valdez catastrophe alaskas 
congressional delegation had included in the bill a provision 
barring any tanker involved in an oil spill of more than 1 million 
gallons anywhere in the world from ever entering prince william 
sound 
the house and senate approved separate oil spill bills last 
november but progress on reconciling the measures stalled over a 
number of issues there were disagreements over whether to require 
doublehull tankers and whether the bill should be linked to an 
international treaty limiting oil spill liability it was decided 
in june not to make such a link 
with the most controversial issues resolved going into 
thursdays final meeting of the conference committee there 
remained only minor changes to be made in the legislation before it 
was approved by a voice vote 
injecting some lastminute drama rep walter jones dnc was 
successful in tacking on a moratorium on offshore oil drilling 
along the midatlantic states until further environmental studies 
can be made 
the amendment is aimed at plans by mobil corp and several 
other oil companies to drill for natural gas on leases off cape 
hatteras nc it prohibits any drilling until after oct 1 1991 
so the new environmental studies can be conducted 
rep ron marlenee rmont who opposed the amendment said he 
expects the provision to be challenged when the compromise bill 
comes up for approval in the house congressional sources said 
however they doubt the issue will derail the legislation

it took three refueling stops for secretary of 
state james a baker iii to get to indonesia on his 30yearold 
us air force jet but as slowly as he treks through four nations 
in asia he is only an electronic holler away from his command post 
at home 
bakers plane has parallel telephone and printed message 
systems both equipped with scramblers for confidential 
conversations and sensitive exchanges they nearly always work 
a couple of weeks ago while stretching his legs at the airport 
in shannon ireland while the jet was refueled baker was taken 
aback by reporters whose editors had just told them of the deal 
west german chancellor helmut kohl had struck in moscow clearing 
the way for german unification 
the terms reached with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
surpassed anything baker expected to see accomplished when he got 
to paris for sixnation talks in germany terrific terrific 
baker told reporters recovering quickly 
the fact of the matter deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger said wednesday baker should have had a headsup the 
guy at the airport who had the information missed connections with 
baker because baker was taking a walk 
eagleburger who takes over as acting secretary of state when 
baker is abroad or on vacation is only a telephone call or an 
electronic message away from the jet or from the headquarters baker 
establishes when he reaches his destination 
it works eagleburger said in an interview i suppose if 
they are off at a dinner in paris and something develops it is 
going to take longer to get in touch but it works the 
communications on the plane are fantastic 
most of the material washington sends to baker is dull routine 
reports are transmitted to be scanned by assistants traveling with 
him as well as wire service reports and press clippings 
he doesnt leave the state department behind said another 
us official there is a sort of constant back and forth and 
yet there is a tendency not to overburden him 
one reason baker can breathe easy is his comfortable 
relationship with eagleburger their backgrounds are as different 
as houston bakers hometown and stevens point wis which 
eagleburger left for college the army and then a career in the 
foreign service with time out for four lucrative years as a 
washington consultant 
at the start eagleburger had bakers permission to join any 
meeting he wished an offer eagleburger accepted more often at the 
beginning 
on this baker has been superb eagleburger said i think 
ive got a pretty good sense of where he is going to come out on an 
issue if i am in doubt i try to get a hold of him and find out 
this doesnt happen too often 
for a national security council meeting wednesday at the white 
house he substituted for baker without consulting him on the issue 
at hand eagleburger would not disclose the topic president bush 
took up that day with his closest advisers 
eagleburger prepared by holding his own sessions first at the 
state department 
this is a case by and large you represent the department 
unless you know the secretary disagrees with what the departments 
view would be he said in this case i assure you he would not 
disagree 
and then there is the crisis situation 
last december as bush baker and brent scowcroft the 
presidents national security assistant flew together on air force 
one to malta for a summit meeting with gorbachev army rebels 
mounted a coup in the philippines the future looked bleak for 
usbacked president corazon aquino 
she prevailed after two us jet fighter planes from clark air 
base provided air support for government troops buzzed rebel 
positions and otherwise made sure the dissidents knew on which side 
washington stood 
during the crisis eagleburger was in the state departments 
operations center the guarded communications hub vice president 
dan quayle and robert gates the former cia official who is 
scowcrofts deputy were at the white house 
we had a hookup and then the vice president was on the 
telephone with baker thats an example of where we were able to 
make decisions based on where the powers were namely on the 
airplane eagleburger said we didnt have to wing it from 
here the communications were fine 
pausing for a moment eagleburger continued that was a 
decision to use american military forces these are not the kinds 
of decisions you make on your own without the president

junk bond financier michael milken and 
convicted stock speculator ivan boesky will be granted immunity 
from additional prosecution to get them to testify before congress 
that decision by the house energy and commerce committee on 
thursday means that nothing the two most famous figures in the wall 
street scandals of the 1980s tell to congress could be used against 
them in court 
no date has been set for their appearance before the panels 
investigations subcommittee but the committee agreed to delay 
milkens testimony until after he is sentenced for securities 
fraud now scheduled for oct 1 
the committee voted 421 to grant immunity a twothirds 
majority was needed the lone dissent came from rep joe barton 
rtexas spokesman craig murphy said the congressman does not 
believe in giving immunity to convicted felons 
boesky has agreed to extensive subcommittee staff interviews 
before his actual testimony milken has not agreed to such 
interviews said rep john dingell dmich chairman of both the 
committee and subcommittee 
milken former head of drexel burnham lambert incs highrisk 
highyield bond department pleaded guilty to six felony charges in 
april and agreed to pay 600 million to settle the biggest 
financial fraud case against an individual he faces up to 28 years 
in prison at sentencing in new york 
boesky once a leading speculator in the stocks of companies 
that were potential takeover targets pleaded guilty to one count 
of conspiracy to violate securities laws and was released april 4 
after serving about twothirds of a threeyear prison sentence 
the committees vote ended a tug of war between the justice 
department which does not want milken to testify before he is 
sentenced and dingell the powerful committee chairman 
previously dingell wanted to hear from milken before the end of 
the current congressional session expected sometime in early 
october 
justice department sources who asked not to be identified said 
prosecutors were concerned milken could withdraw his guilty plea 
after being immunized making it difficult if not impossible 
for any prosecution to continue 
dingell said the us attorneys office asked the subcommittee 
to withhold taking milkens testimony until after the sentencing 
and congressional sources said dingell agreed to the delay 
in a memo to committee members circulated before the vote 
dingell noted that the recent reversal of some of the charges 
against irancontra figure oliver north raised concerns about 
immunized testimony 
a federal appeals court in washington ruled that congressional 
testimony like that given by north in the summer of 1987 could 
unfairly prejudice a defendants trial 
a spokesman for milken said of course we will testify when 
they ask him to testify 
milken was linked to a large insider trading network headed by 
boesky 
dingell wants to know about some 500 limited partnerships set 
up by milken and the drexel junk bond department that bought 
significant stakes in hot junk bond issues underwritten by drexel 
before they were made available to the public 
critics say the activity drove up the price of those issues at 
the expense of drexel customers but the transactions legality has 
never been resolved 
milken was called to testify before the investigations 
subcommittee in 1988 but invoked his fifth amendment right against 
possible selfincrimination 
a subpoena also was authorized at that time for boesky but never 
acted upon pending the outcome of the milken probe

ethiopia no longer proclaims itself communist 
and is planning a future of perestroika private enterprise 
political competition and reconciliation its foreign minister says 
the onetime staunchest soviet ally in africa is also on a road 
to stronger ties with the united states minister tesfaye dinka 
said after meetings the past two days with deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger other state department officials and 
members of congress 
thursdays talk with eagleburger was described by tesfaye as 
an important milestone toward improving us relations long 
mired in disagreement over human rights abuses in ethiopia it was 
perhaps the highestlevel usethiopian meeting in a decade 
there was no public declaration however about normalization 
which would include restoring diplomatic representation to the 
level of ambassador 
the minister said he thanked eagleburger for us relief food 
shipments sent over the years to his starvationplagued country and 
assured him that the governments of ethiopia and israel were in 
complete understanding about continuing emigration of ethiopian 
jews to israel 
eagleburger urged that an estimated 15000 remaining ethiopian 
jews be free to leave and voiced concern about reports that the 
flow had been interrupted said a us official who insisted on 
anonymity 
tesfaye said he and eagleburger discussed current efforts for 
settlement of the 29year eritrean rebellion and the need for the 
international community to get insurgents controlling massawa port 
in northern ethiopia to open it to relief food shipments 
political competition i think will be on the agenda of peace 
talks with the eritrean movement and i think its something that 
will come about tesfaye told reporters details are uncertain 
but the constitution will be revised if necessary he added 
president mengistu haile mariams ethiopian government is 
undertaking economic and political changes that will bring a 
marketoriented economy with greater incentives and encouragement 
for domestic and foreign investors tesfaye said

drug enforcement officials and strained relations between the 
united states and mexico 
authorities had described matta as one of the worlds most 
active cocaine dealers last year assistant us attorney gary 
allen feess placed him on the level of the top 10 colombian drug 
traffickers 
mattas lawyer martin stolar called the verdicts a terrible 
miscarriage of justice and said he will appeal 
matta cannot conceive of being convicted for a crime he had 
nothing to do with stolar said he questions the ability of 
us courts to fairly and adequately protect a honduran citizen 
accused in this country 
matta could receive life in prison at sentencing sept 25 
he already is serving a life sentence in the united states for 
running a cocaine syndicate that generated 73 million in just nine 
months in 1981 he was convicted by a federal jury here in 
september after his arrest in honduras 
camarena was a 31yearold dea agent working in mexico when he 
was kidnapped cartel leaders were angered because the agents 
undercover work led to the seizure of 10000 tons of marijuana in 
1984 prosecutors said 
testimony at both us trials showed camarena was tortured and 
interrogated by drug lords before being slain with his pilot 
alfredo zavala avelar 
after camarenas battered body was discovered a month later 
mexican authorities blamed rafael caro quintero a cartel leader 
but dea agents were skeptical that the reckless illiterate 
rafa had acted alone us authorities sought the brains of the 
cartel including members of mexicos power elite and matta also 
known as el negro 
the dea has vowed to capture every person involved in his 
slaying 
twentytwo people have been charged in the united states and 
more than 20 convicted in mexico among those serving prison terms 
in mexico are caro and another drug kingpin ernesto fonseco 
carrillo 
antiamerican riots broke out in honduras in 1988 after us 
authorities arrested matta and flew him to the united states five 
people died and the us embassy annex was torched 
honduras has no extradition treaty with the united states which 
added to the anger of citizens who knew matta as the employer of up 
to 5000 people at his cattle ranches dairy farms and cigar 
factories 
disputes between mexico and the united states over the case have 
erupted several times mexico said this month it would seek the 
extradition of a dea agent and a mexican informant who allegedly 
plotted the kidnapping of a guadalajara doctor accused in 
camarenas murder 
mattas codefendants are ruben zuno arce a guadalajara 
businessman and brotherinlaw of former mexican president luis 
echeverria juan jose bernabe ramirez a former mexican homicide 
officer and javier vasquez velasco a bodyguard accused of 
murdering two us tourists apparently mistaken for us drug 
agents

two cosmonauts have repaired a balky hatch that 
bedeviled them and dangerously prolonged a previous spacewalk 
earlier this month according to soviet news reports 
anatoly solovyov and alexander balandin also removed and stowed 
handrails during the threehour 31minute spacewalk thursday 
they had affixed the handrails to the outside of the spacecraft 
during a july 17 excursion to repair torn thermal insulation on the 
outside of their soyuz tm9 capsule the tass news agency said 
tass said ground controllers indicated that human error at the 
start of the previous spacewalk caused the hatch problem the 
cosmonauts had opened the hatch before the airlock was completely 
depressurized and it swung outward with such force that a key 
joint was damaged 
solovyev and balandin began their spacewalk thursday by again 
trying to close the hatch which was less than an inch ajar tass 
said 
they made little progress however and ground controllers told 
them to relax and work on stowing the ladderlike handrails which 
were left behind july 17 when solovyev and balandin had to rush 
back inside the spacecraft because their oxygen was running low 
the handrails could have posed a problem when the capsule 
separated from the mir space station for the cosmonauts return 
voyage home 
tass said ground controllers studied a televised picture of the 
hatch and officials at the soviet mission control center in 
kaliningrad outside moscow recommended how to repair the joint 
tass said the cosmonauts then were able to close the hatch 
completely 
they pressurized the airlock and removed their space suits tass 
said 
the evening television newscast vremya reported that ground 
controllers would be monitoring the pressure in the airlock to make 
sure the outside hatch had sealed properly 
the balky hatch was the latest in a series of problems to 
trouble the cosmonauts sixmonth mission 
tass focused on its accomplishments completing 506 of 520 
scientific experiments photographing 84 million square miles of 
the earths surface and growing 23 crystals in the weightless 
environment of space the report said each crystal was worth 1 
million 
the cosmonauts who have been in space since feb 11 are 
scheduled to return home on aug 9 a replacement crew is to be 
launched aug 1

the united states is considering 
direct contacts with cambodias communist government in addition to 
vietnam to try to end the war in cambodia secretary of state james 
a baker said today 
baker said the withdrawal last year of vietnamese troops backing 
the cambodian government gives us cause to see whether hanoi is 
now prepared to support a process of political reconciliation 
that would lead to free elections 
we are also considering contacts with the phnom penh regime 
he added 
the moves would fit in both with efforts to reduce eastwest 
tensions and with continuing us support for the noncommunist 
cambodian rebels baker said in a speech to the association of 
southeast asian nations or asean 
he spoke on the first day of a threeday meeting of the group 
which comprises thailand singapore malaysia the philippines 
brunei and indonesia the foreign ministers of australia canada 
the european community japan new zealand are also attending the 
session 
asean foreign ministers criticized bakers announcement last 
week that the united states would not recognize the united nations 
delegate from the threepart cambodian resistance because it 
includes the communist khmer rouge 
during khmer rouge rule of cambodia from 197578 hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians died from starvation or executions while 
the government enforced a radical program to collectivize 
agriculture 
vietnam invaded in 1978 and toppled the khmer rouge led by pol 
pot but the rebels have staged a string of recent battlefield 
victories and are the strongest antigovernment force 
baker arrived in jakarta thursday on the first leg of a 
fournation asian tour he assured asean that their goals and those 
of the united states were not contradictory 
our common approach to cambodia has for a decade focused 
on three goals a verified withdrawal of vietnamese troops the 
prevention of the return to power of the khmer rouge and genuine 
selfdetermination for the cambodian people through free 
elections he said 
the guerrilla resistance was formed under asean sponsorship in 
1982 with us support the khmer rouge is by far its most powerful 
component 
continued support for the coalition at the un is only 
providing the khmer rouge diplomatic cover for its military 
maneuvers baker said 
baker also noted that washington is expanding its military ties 
with singapore which offered expanded use of its facilities to 
us warships and planes last year baker is due to visit singapore 
on sunday on the next stop of his trip which also includes 
mongolia and talks with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in siberia 
on the issue of refugees arriving from indochina baker said the 
united states had met its commitments and that its critics were 
indulging in fingerpointing 
asean warned tuesday that it reserved the right to turn away 
boat people the warning was aimed at pressuring washington to end 
its opposition to the compulsory return of boat people who are 
found to be fleeing for economic reasons rather than because of 
political persecution 
more than 130000 boat people are held in camps in the region 
refusal by the united states and vietnam to accept mandatory 
repatriation led to postponement of an international conference on 
the problem in geneva earlier this month

up from 7500 percent 
currency dealers said the weakness of the tokyo stock market and 
the japanese government bonds slip were the main factors for the 
dollars gain this week 
besides the dollar usually is bought here as a safe haven in 
times of international tension said toshiyuki nishiguchi an 
analyst with daiwa securities he referred to the dollars gain and 
decline in share prices in tokyo in the wake of tension in the 
middle east between iraq and kuwait

japanese government bonds were other factors nishiguchi said

today is more concerned about the declining share prices than any 
other factors

interest rates on the bond market kagawa said 
the benchmark government bond has lost 084 points from 8614 
last friday when the yield stood at 7385 percent 
japans discount rate and long term prime rate are one of the 
lowest among industrialized countries and the country has been 
under pressure from its trading partners to raise the rates 
higher interest rates tend to make a countrys stock market less 
attractive to investors

a new group that is not even taking 
part in sundays legislative elections a buddhist association 
is rapidly becoming a potent force in mongolia 
as of early july the union of true believers had registered 
79000 members making it second in size only to the ruling 
communist party which claims 98000 
new members are joining hourly said the unions chairman 
bayantsagaan who like most mongolians uses only one name 
its like a river after a heavy rain he said in an 
interview this week at the unions headquarters in a traditional 
nomads tent or ger outside gandan temple in ulan bator 
when the communists took power in mongolia in 1921 they ended 
the buddhist monasteries centuriesold role in politics in the 
1930s the communists shut down more than 700 monasteries and 
forced the monks to find secular work religious worship was banned 
and later tightly restricted 
gandan was reopened in 1944 and until april it was the 
countrys sole place of buddhist worship 
but bayantsagaan and others say most mongolians continued to 
pray in private when the democratic revolution sweeping eastern 
europe inspired mongolians to demonstrate last winter and spring 
for an end to authoritarianism buddhist monks and lay believers 
tentatively ventured into the fray 
they held a protest of their own to demand monasteries be 
reopened and sent a letter to the legislature calling for an end to 
government control of religion 
they formed the union of true believers in march and it 
established a political wing the mongolian buddhist party 
the party has yet to register with the government and so is 
ineligible to put candidates forward in mongolias first 
multiparty legislative elections being held sunday 
but when the next elections are held the buddhists could win 
said bayarsuren the party chairman claiming strength in the 
somons the lowest administrative units in rural mongolia 
in some somons the entire population has joined the 
movement he said somons usually have about 2000 residents 
there are no figures for the percentage of mongolias 2 million 
people who still adhere to buddhism but both men maintained that 
it is a majority they said young people are as interested in 
religion as their elders 
should the party win a future election bayarsuren said it 
would restore complete freedom of worship and reestablish 
traditional links between buddhism and government religion 
government and people will be one he said 
even without joining in this years election the buddhists have 
made a more rapid comeback than was anticipated in march when the 
communists pledged to allow political and religious freedoms 
at that time the chief monk of gandan temple gaandan said two 
more temples would be reopened shortly but other restorations would 
proceed slowly and there would be no effort by the buddhists to 
take political power 
since then however bayarsuren said about 30 temples have been 
reopened using public donations

a british colonial court today convicted five 
prodemocracy activists of using a megaphone and collecting money 
without a permit in a case that has been called a show trial to 
suppress political activism 
critics said the verdict was another example of britain 
kowtowing to communist china which takes control of the colony in 
1997 when britains 99year lease runs out 
magistrate betty kwan told a packed courtroom that using 
megaphones during political demonstrations was not necessary or 
justified and fined the five the equivalent of about 20 each 
the defendants four men and one woman said they would appeal 
if they lose they said they would refuse the fine and risk prison 
we are fully prepared for the consequences said yeung sum 
a professor at hong kong university and one of the defendants 
he accused the british colonial government of trying to 
silence those who express their political opinions in a peaceful 
and orderly manner 
yeung lawyer albert ho labor union leader lau chinshek 
teacher lee wingtat and christian worker wong pikwan the woman 
in the group are central committee members of the united democrats 
of hong kong a political party that was formed in april to promote 
democracy in hong kong 
they along with political activist tsang kimshing were 
prosecuted under a 1933 law forbidding the use of bullhorns the 
law is rarely invoked and widely ignored by teachers and tour 
guides who use bullhorns daily 
tsang who is not a leader of the united democrats party was 
acquitted 
the group held a peaceful sitin at the star ferry terminal in 
february and called for greater protection of human rights in hong 
kong they collected donations and gave speeches through a 
megaphone 
police charged the group in late may two weeks before the 
anniversary of the bloody crackdown on a movement for democracy in 
china on june 4 about 100000 people took to the streets in hong 
kong that day to commemorate the crackdown 
several us congressmen and petra kelly leader of west 
germanys green party have expressed concern about the case 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization said it would adopt the defendants as prisoners of 
conscience if they are imprisoned 
fridays case marks the third time in the last 10 months that 
the hong kong government has prosecuted political activists 
many people in hong kong worry that once china takes control of 
the territory it will break its promise to maintain hong kongs 
freewheeling economic and social system for 50 years 
many also have begun to doubt britains commitment to supporting 
hong kong up to 1997 
over the past few months the colonial government has barred 
prominent chinese dissidents from entering hong kong censored 
films critical of china and turned away the goddess of democracy 
radio ship which wanted to beam prodemocracy messages to mainland 
china 
hong kong government officials have publicly denied that the 
government is trying to suppress political activism 
but in a confidential letter written to chinese authorities late 
last year british colonial official william ehrman stressed that 
britain would not allow hong kong to be used as a base for 
subversive activities

the capitol hill sex scandal that prompted 
congressional colleagues to reprimand rep barney frank isnt 
likely to hurt him at home constituents said 
frank who faces no serious republican challenge in his 
reelection bid drew the reprimand thursday in a 408108 vote that 
imposed the lightest punishment possible for his dealings with a 
homosexual prostitute 
im pleased he was just reprimanded even though i have some 
concerns about the whole thing said kathi sadow of brookline 
hes an extremely good congressman who showed extremely bad 
judgment and well vote for him again 
but george fattell of brighton said house representatives were 
too lenient 
i think he should have been censured fattell said 
the house rejected republican proposals to censure or expel the 
fiveterm liberal democrat who apologized for the indiscretions he 
said arose because he wanted to conceal his homosexuality 
frank was accused of using his influence on behalf of male 
prostitute stephen l gobie whom he paid 80 for sex in 1985 and 
then hired as a personal assistant gobie whose allegations 
sparked the scandal allegedly operated a prostitution service from 
the home he shared with frank 
some of franks constituents said they had mixed feelings about 
him 
im torn said nicole tufo 21 i think what he did was 
wrong but i guess i feel bad for him 
newton city clerk edward g english said he still supports 
frank citing a letter the congressman wrote him in 1981 
congratulating him for a decade of public service 
at a time when so many negative things are being said about 
people in public life it is important to remind people especially 
young people that public service can be a noble cause the 
letter read 
i think he still believes in those principles english said 
im sad for barney said newton mayor thomas mann im sad 
for everybody thats gone through so much i wonder how well others 
would have taken this 
hilda dorgin of brookline echoed the sentiments of many people 
interviewed i think hes tremendous 
i dont agree with what he did but i think hes an excellent 
politician dorgin said 
ina gibson of roxbury said franks sexual preference should not 
cloud evaluations of his achievements 
barney frank has been a very good politician she said i 
think hes done a good job his personal life is his own business 
as far as im concerned

every day since an earthquake ravaged 
this mountain resort july 16 photographer washington canilao goes 
to burnham park hoping someone will ask him for souvernir pictures 
few do 
business is slow said canilao 39 a park photographer 
since 1966 the only people asking us for photographs are people 
who want pictures of their damaged homes we are hoping some 
tourists would start promenading the park again 
but officials fear it may take years for the citys tourism 
industry to recover 
the devastating earthquake killed nearly 400 people in this 
city where thousands of filipinos spend their summers to escape 
the countrys torrid tropical heat 
nationwide more than 1600 people died and about 1000 others 
are missing more than 90000 people are homeless 
for baguios 300000 residents the return to normalcy has been 
slow 
there have been scattered incidents of looting and muggings of 
pedestrians at night along baguios session road the main 
thoroughfare 
grocery and department stores are open only for a few hours a 
day the main market is closed but vendors are scattered along many 
sidestreets 
thousands have left the city to live with relatives in the 
lowlands until aftershocks cease and conditions improve 
many residents also have remained outdoors staying in tents or 
their cars for fear of the potential danger of aftershocks 
baguio nearly a mile above sea level is a city designed for 
fun and relaxation after seizing the islands in 1898 the 
americans searched for a mountain refuge from the sweltering 
tropical heat 
they chose a site 130 miles north of manila where the cool 
nights and sweet pine air reminded then of americas catskills and 
poconos 
daniel hudson burnham who pioneered development of the 
skyscraper in chicago and new york designed the city whose major 
park bears his name 
the american presence remains us officials estimate about 
1500 american civilians live in baguio the city includes the us 
air forces camp john hay a rest and recreation area for the 
40000 american service members defense department civilians and 
military dependents stationed in the philippines 
but the quake heavily damaged eight hotels including the luxury 
hyatt terraces 
the job of restoring baguio is difficult said city engineer 
valentin julian it will take 10 to 15 years to rebuild baguio 
and that depends on the availability of funds 
julian said about half the buildings and homes in the city 
reported major damage and another 40 percent suffered cracks and 
minor damage about 15 percent of the buildings reporting major 
damage will have to be condemned 
johnvic trinos a baguio resident said the main problem facing 
the city is the lack of electricity 
restore electricity and business will follow suit trinos 
said power has been restored in areas near the city hall 
hospitals and water stations but the rest of the city remained 
without electricity 
mayor jaime bugnosen said he is optimistic that the city will 
recover in a few years 
i would not accept baguio is dead or dying bugnosen said 
we are all still alive here

science minister yuval neeman said today that 
israel has chemical weapons and would use them if attacked by iraq 
the remarks were the most farreaching by an israeli leader on 
the issue in the past israeli officials have always refused 
comment on whether israel has chemical weapons though the country 
was widely believed to have the arms 
neemans statement intensified the war of words that was started 
when iraqi president saddam hussein said he would destroy half of 
israel with chemical weapons if attacked 
in my opinion we have an excellent response and that is to 
threaten hussein with the same merchandise said neeman who also 
is head of israels space program 
neeman a member of the ultrarightist tehiya party said any 
advanced nation has the capability to prepare chemical weapons 
and if there is an enemy like this it is possible to prepare 
a suitable response he said on israel radio i have no doubt 
that also today we can respond to a threat like this 
defense ministry spokesman dan weinreich refused comment 
the 65yearold neeman has a long involvement with israels 
military and scientific establishments he has served both as 
deputy director of army intelligence and scientific director of 
israels atomic energy program 
eliyahu ben elissar head of parliaments defense and foreign 
affairs committee said israel would retaliate harshly if attacked 
by iraq 
iraq after the first use of a missile wont be the same iraq 
any more hussein will lose control in a split second the radio 
quoted ben elissar as saying in a speech thursday night in tel 
aviv the report did not elaborate 
neeman and ben elissar came under sharp criticism from elazar 
granot head of the socialist mapam party who said their words 
were as irresponsible as those of radical arab leaders 
the two have joined the crazy club of libyan leader moammar 
ghadafi and saddam hussein the time has come that the prime 
minister call them to order so that it becomes clear that not all 
government leaders have lost their minds granot was quoted as 
saying by the radio 
israel has been accusing the iraqi leader of heightening 
tensions in the middle east since april when he first issued the 
threat to use chemical weapons against israel if it attacked his 
own country with atomic bombs 
at the same time israeli officials have been threatening iraq 
with harsh retaliation last week maj gen avihu binnun 
commander of israels air force said israel would inflict severe 
damage on iraq if it attacked the jewish state

a usfunded project to 
study tigers in the wild has been canceled by a state official in 
southern india experts say the move threatens indias attempts to 
save its share of the worlds biggest cat 
the minister of forests for karnataka also is trying to transfer 
an internationally recognized forest service officer involved in 
the research 
minister basappa basavalingappa said he wants a friend to 
replace forest service officer km chinnappa who was awarded a 
medal for wildlife conservation in 1989 by the new york zoological 
society 
observers in bangalore the state capital say political motives 
were behind the ministers decision 
basavalingappa said he stopped the indous tiger project 
funded by a 90000 grant from the us fish and wildlife service 
because it interferes with nature 
if nature wants tigers to die out who are we to save them 
he said in an interview have you ever heard a tiger complain 
an increasing number of rural indians oppose the countrys 
system of national parks they accuse the government of depriving 
them of grazing land a growing number of deaths from encounters 
with lions tigers and elephants has fueled this anger last year 
at least 150 people were killed by wild animals 
ironically the goal of the canceled project was to alleviate 
this tension 
the project sought to answer such questions as how much land 
tigers need how much prey they eat and how they mate according to 
its director ku karanth who heads the indian center for 
wildlife studies in mysore also in karnataka 
armed with this knowledge forest officers could better manage 
tigers moving the cats from an overpopulated reserve to a less 
crowded one or in extreme cases culling tigers he said 
karanth said he had hoped his research could be used by indias 
project tiger a string of 18 tiger reserves established in 1973 
although they have gotten high marks for protecting tigers the 
reserves have been criticized for their failure to adequately 
manage the tiger population 
karanth said he would fight the ministers order in court but 
was not optimistic about winning 
melvin sunquist a tiger expert and professor of wildlife 
ecology at the university of florida said the ministers actions 
could set indias efforts to save its royal bengal tiger back 
decades 
its sad what politicians can do to wildlife sunquist said 
in a telephone interview from florida this was a key project 
sunquist who spent a decade studying tigers in southern nepal 
helped start the indian project 
royal bengals account for more than half the worlds estimated 
5000 tigers only the massive siberian tiger which can weigh 800 
pounds and stretch for 10 feet is bigger 
the government claims there are 4200 tigers in the country but 
wildlife experts say this figure is at least 25 percent too high 
tiger census takers in india count paw prints not considered a 
reliable technique 
basavalingappa canceled the project at nagarahole national 
forest a stunning mixture of teak forests bamboo groves swamps 
and gorges on july 12 
the minister also ordered forest officer chinnappa known for 
protecting the park from poachers transferred to a desk job 
chinnappa who has run nagarahole for the past 20 years said he 
will fight the transfer in court 
basavalingappa began attacking the research project in may 
following the deaths of five tigers within three months in the 
park at the time researchers in the park had just begun capturing 
tigers and putting radio collars around their necks to monitor 
their movements 
basavalingappa blamed the collars for the deaths but reports by 
the state ministry of forests and the central governments ministry 
of environment and forests concluded the deaths were unrelated to 
the project indeed only one of the five tigers had been collared

brent mydland keyboard player singer and 
songwriter since 1979 for the psychedelic rock band the grateful 
dead was found dead in his home he was 37 
friends discovered mydlands body thursday in the bedroom of his 
home in lafayette a suburb 25 miles east of san francisco said 
sgt richard terry of the contra costa county coroners office 
it was not clear when or how mydland died but there was no sign 
of foul play terry said an autopsy was scheduled for today 
mydland had returned tuesday from a three week national tour 
with the band terry said 
we lost a brother and we are very devastated grateful dead 
spokesman dennis mcnally said 
surviving band members met thursday night to talk to grieve 
and to figure out what to do next mcnally said tickets already 
have been sold for grateful dead shows in august and september in 
california ohio pennsylvania and new york city and in october in 
sweden west germany france and england 
the grateful dead formed in 1965 and were at the forefront of 
the psychedelic counterculture movement in san francisco among 
their better known songs are truckin casey jones and 
touch of grey 
known for their diverse live sets and spontaneous jams the 
grateful dead today retain a strong following of fans known as 
deadheads many fans follow the band from show to show and 
trade tapes of concerts which the band lets them record 
mydland joined the band in april 1979 replacing keyboardist 
keith godchaux who died a year later in an auto accident godchaux 
had replaced keyboardist ron pig pen mckernan who died of 
cirrhosis of the liver at age 27 in 1973 
mydland was born in germany to american parents stationed there 
with the military and grew up in the san francisco area 
as a teenager he played with small local rock n roll bands 
he worked with the group batdorf and rodney in the early 1970s 
then joined the los angelesbased rock band silver 
he joined the grateful dead after a stint with rhythm guitarist 
and vocalist bob weirs side band bobby and the midnites 
at first mydland had played in the shadow of the other more 
famous band members including lead guitarist and vocalist jerry 
garcia but he developed a greater presence in recent years 
writing more songs and helping the bands harmonies with what 
mcnally called his rough bluesy textured voice 
john barlow who had collaborated with mydland on most of his 
songs said brent could pick his way through anything 
immediately which meant he had the special requirement it was 
going to take to walk into the dead overnight 
he was musically central to the band but he was so good at 
what he did that he was able to become fundamental to everything 
that the band was doing musically without it being immediately 
apparent to the audience barlow said 
tunes mydland wrote include far from me and the 
environmental ballad we can run but we cant hide used 
recently in an audubon society video 
most recently mydland frequently performed his i will take 
you home a lullaby written for his two young daughters 
he is survived by his wife lisa his daughters and his parents 
who live in the sacramento area

police said they will try to dig up the 
bodies of as many as 41 victims of a drug cult that practiced human 
sacrifice in a remote mountain region of northern mexico for five 
years 
juan granados martinez the federal judicial police chief in 
nayarit state said thursday his force and police in durango state 
planned to begin digging today in a border area 
police on tuesday arrested 14 members of the alleged cult the 
nine men and five youths were charged with homicide arms 
possession criminal association and drugrelated offenses 
nayarit district attorneys investigator jose fernando armas 
hernandez said thursday authorities learned that at least 41 men 
women and children may have been slain by group members in macabre 
rituals practiced since 1983 
police said cult members believed human sacrifice would protect 
their illegal drugrelated activities 
armas said police found a leather quiver with 41 arrows 
apparently dipped in blood that alleged cult member esteban 
mendoza cervantes claimed represented the spirits of each of the 
sacrificed humans 
cervantes 19 was allegedly the chief aide of olayo soto soto 
accused of being the head sorcerer of the devilworshipping 
cult 
soto denied the accusations thursday in an interview at police 
headquarters in tepic the capital of nayarit 
those are rumors and lies of the authorities soto told the 
associated press 
the group was arrested while cultivating marijuana plantations 
in the horse hill region on the border of nayarit and durango 
states about 450 miles northwest of mexico city police said 
cult members sacrificed their victims before an altar consisting 
of a 16inchhigh clay monkey in offerings to a deity called el 
amigo the friend police said 
granados said the group claimed to be practicing a version of 
palo mayombe a religion that originated in the congo and sometimes 
uses human skulls in its rituals 
he said the occult rites were practiced in caves on remote 
hillsides where police discovered apparent cult material including 
a statuette of the virgin mary with her face replaced by a skull 
police said they also found a footlong dagger a 32caliber 
hunting rifle and 38caliber pistol 
the dagger may have been used by soto who allegedly stabbed the 
victims in the back of the neck to kill them armas said 
in addition to soto and cervantes police idendified those in 
custody as jorge mendoza cumplido geronimo rodriguez flores 
arturo mendoza medina prudencio cervantes soto maclovio soto

economic activity last year was significantly 
weaker than previously thought because the government badly 
overestimated the strength in personal incomes the commerce 
department said today 
the department said the broadest measure of economic health 
the gross national product grew just 25 percent in 1989 instead 
of the 3 percent previously estimated 
that put economic growth at its slowest pace since a drop of 25 
percent in the recession year of 1982 
the government also put out new estimates for growth in 1988 and 
1987 it said the gnp grew 45 percent in 1988 just slightly above 
the 44 percent previously estimated it put growth in 1987 at 34 
percent down from a 37 percent previous estimate 
but it was the 1989 change that was likely to raise eyebrows 
the government blamed its mistake on overestimating by 579 
billion the amount americans earned in wages and salaries 
the initial estimate is based on a partial sample of businesses 
while the revision takes into account more complete data gathered 
from the countrys roughly 6 million businesses 
the more complete data is used when the government makes its 
onceayear revisions to gnp data every july 
while the full details of the commerce department revisions were 
made public only today the information was made available earlier 
to economists at the office and management and budget 
the big drop in incomes which also would affect taxes was a 
major factor behind the administrations dramatic increase in the 
budget deficit it boosted the 1991 deficit to 169 billion up 
from an estimate of 1005 billion made last january

government troops have killed civilians 
and dumped their bodies in the sea as rebels advanced on the city 
center where president samuel doe remained barricaded in his 
mansion witnesses and diplomats said 
the rebels could be seen thursday trying to battle their way 
over a bridge into the heart of monrovia the capital of this west 
african nation 
the rebels who began their offensive in december accuse the 
government of corruption and human rights abuses but their 
insurgency has become a tribal war between supporters of doe and 
backers of the rebels 
at least 375000 liberians have fled the fighting into 
neighboring guinea ivory coast and sierra leone the office of the 
un high commissioner for refugees said today in geneva 
the european community today gave more than 330000 for medical 
aid to help about 30000 of the refugees in the ivory coast 
in monrovia soldiers of does krahn tribe killed at least two 
dozen civilians who were taken from their houses from a hospital 
ward and from lodgings near the beleaguered citys one remaining 
airstrip said witnesses and diplomats who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the suspects some of whom were shot while tied back to back 
with their hands bound behind them were gio or mano tribesmen 
suspected of supporting the rebels they said 
some victims were taken overnight to a beach near the citys 
exclusive mamba point district where they were summarily shot or 
slashed to death with machetes the witnesses said 
their bodies and the rotting remains of previous victims were 
dumped into the sea nearby the bodies could be seen bobbing in the 
surf 
the ambassadors of the five european economic community nations 
represented in liberia france britain italy germany and spain 
expressed horror and disgust at the tribal killings of innocent 
civilians being carried out by both sides in the present conflict 
their statement said there was ample evidence that government 
soldiers are continuing to murder gios and manos more than 100 of 
whom were yesterday taken from centers in monrovia while the 
national patriotic front are murdering krahn and mandingos 
if liberia as a nation is to retain the respect of the rest of 
the world these killings must cease forthwith the statement said 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
doe still had not asked the united states for help in leaving his 
country 
the spokesman said insurgent troops believed to be those of 
rebel leader charles taylor moved into the city thursday morning 
after heavy fighting northeast of the capital on wednesday night 
other rebel forces presumably those of rival rebel leader 
prince johnson moved into the city thursday morning amid 
smallarms fire boucher said 
johnson is believed to have split with taylor sometime in the 
past three months and some diplomats say his army is now stronger 
than taylors national patriotic front despite his first name 
johnson is not known to have any aristocratic background 
discipline among the estimated 1500 remaining troops loyal to 
doe has broken down and a western diplomat said many were drugged 
but some diplomats had also dismissed does troops more than a 
month ago predicting they would flee as soon as rebels got 
anywhere near the city 
some government units have continued to fight blocking taylors 
main rebel force in the citys eastern suburbs earlier this week 
a rival faction led by johnson surprised government troops and 
fought its way into the downtown area briefly before being turned 
back 
more than 8000 refugees were camped without food or water in a 
us compound near the american embassy and many reacted with 
terror when security guards passed word that soldiers intended to 
enter to check identities and search for rebels 
a group of about two dozen soldiers blocked the path of three 
foreign reporters covering the conflict and seized their car 
without explanation some ordered the reporters to leave the city 
center 
it is not safe there is nobody in control here one soldier

east germanys secondbiggest political party 
withdrew its threat to resign from the government today averting a 
political crisis over the process of german unification 
the leftleaning social democrats threatened tuesday to leave 
the coalition government of prime minister lothar de maiziere today 
unless a dispute over united german elections was reached 
the liberal party resigned tuesday over the dispute with 
compromise now in sight on the political feud the liberals planned 
to meet to reconsider their decision 
meanwhile social democrat party chief wolfgang thierse said his 
party would remain in de maizieres government even though a key 
difference remained over how german elections should be held 
the social democrats and the conservative christian demcrats of 
de maiziere the biggest party in east germany agree that the two 
german nations will vote as a single electorate for a united 
parliament on dec 2 
under that plan east germany would dissolve itself dec 1 
the christian democrats and several smaller political parties 
had demanded that east germany remain a nation at the time of 
balloting so that two elections could be held that would give 
smaller parties a better chance of winning seats in parliament 
de maiziere and the christian democrats backed down from that 
demand in recent days 
however disagreement still exists over what percentage of the 
vote a party must get to be represented in parliament 
under west german law parties need 5 percent of the vote to be 
represented in parliament no minimum is required in east germany 
the social democrats want the 5 percent limit while the 
christian democrats and several smaller parties sought to lower it 
de maiziere has said special accomodations should be made to 
ensure that smaller east german parties have a chance to be 
represented in a big new allgerman parliament 
the social democrats in both east and west germany believe the 
lower limit would hurt them by allowing smaller leftist groups to 
get in parliament and splinter the leftleaning vote 
under one proposed compromise smaller parties could run on the 
ballots of larger parties that would allow allied parties to share 
ballot space 
that could hurt the east german communists who countrys no 3 
party because they have no allies 
under another idea the 5 percent limit would be mandated for 
each nation rather than germany as a whole 
that means an east german party would only have to win 5 percent 
of the vote in what is now east germany rather than 5 percent of 
the total vote 
another idea would allow any party with 5 percent of the vote in 
each of the 11 individual states in west germany and five in east 
germany to win representation 
the complicated argument that centered essentially on whether 
east germany should dissolve one day before or immediately after 
elections was basically political manuevering by parties seeking 
the most favorable election conditions 
there was much speculation that west german chancellor helmut 
kohl who longs to be leader of a unified germany was prodding de 
maiziere into insisting on separate elections to boost the west 
german leaders chances

nearly 10 million americans now suffer from 
asthma and the death rate from it has increased more than 30 
percent in seven years according to a new report from federal 
health researchers 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
between 1980 and 1987 the death rate from asthma in the united 
states rose from 13 per 100000 population to 17 the number of 
actual asthma deaths rose from 2891 in 1980 to 4360 in 1987 the 
latest year for which statistical analysis is available 
the increase in asthma fatalities comes as more and more 
americans suffer from the chronic disease characterized by 
difficulty in breathing an estimated 96 million people in the 
united states were affected by asthma in 1987 or about 4 percent 
of the population compared with 68 million in 1980 the cdc said 
in its weekly report 
the death rate for asthma was consistently higher for blacks 
than for whites the cdc said for blacks the asthma fatality rate 
increased 44 percent from 1980 to 1987 from 25 per 100000 to 
36 while the white fatality rate increased 36 percent from 11 
to 15 
death rates were higher for older people with the highest rate 
of asthma death 79 per 100000 in 1987 for people 65 and older 
a number of factors may contribute to the increases in asthma 
deaths and cases the cdc said they include exposure to infections 
and other triggers for bronchial constriction healthcare 
factors and air quality 
the agency called on health care workers to promote timely and 
aggressive medical treatment for asthma

a roadside bomb blast triggered by a 
beam of light injured a senior west german official today and the 
red army faction terrorist group claimed responsibility 
hans neusel the state secretary of the interior ministry 
escaped with only minor injuries though his car was wrecked 
neusel whose ministry is in charge of law enforcement was 
taken to the hospital but released a short time later and returned 
to the scene of the bombing a highway on the outskirts of bonn 
he later told reporters he was happy to be alive 
todays bombing was the first red army faction attack since 
eight longsought fugitives reputed to be top members of the 
group were captured in east germany in recent weeks 
the red army faction has been responsible for a series of 
killings and bomb attacks in west germany in the last two decades 
the eight reputed members of the group captured in east germany 
had been living there under assumed names some for as long as 10 
years some say they had been granted sanctuary by east germanys 
former communist government 
west german officials had believed the roundup had put a serious 
dent in the groups ability to carry out attacks 
todays explosion demolished neusels silver bmw sedan 
shattering the windows ripping apart the interior smashing its 
doors and tearing open the hood and the trunk lid the blast blew a 
large hole in the highway and damaged the guardrail 
officials said neusel probably escaped serious injury because he 
was driving and the bomb went off on the cars passenger side he 
suffered only minor cuts 
the interior ministry said the 62yearold official had no 
security detail and his automobile was not equipped with any 
protective equipment such as armor plating or bulletproof glass 
west german television said neusels driver was on vacation 
police said a letter claiming responsibility in the name of the 
red army faction was found near the site of the attack and that it 
appeared to be genuine 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office said the letter carried the red army faction symbol a red 
star superimposed by a machine gun it said the attack was carried 
out by the jose manuel sevillano commando foerster said 
sevillano was a convicted member of the spanish terrorist group 
grapo who died in may after a sixmonth hunger strike 
foerster said the bomb was triggered by the car crossing a light 
beam he said the devise used today was the same as the one used in 
a bomb attack that killed siemens manager karl heinz beckurts in 
july 1986 near munich 
the attack also resembled the november killing of deutsche bank 
chief alfred herrhausen whose car was blown up by a bomb planted 
by the red army faction near frankfurt he said 
the most recent previous terrorist attack on a government 
official came in september 1988 when shots were fired at hans 
tietmeyer a state secretary in the finance ministry authorities 
said tietmeyer apparently had been the target of a kidnapping 
attempt 
neusel later spoke with reporters about the attack telling 
them you can understand that i am especially happy to be able to 
be with you today 
speaking in a calm unemotional voice described the impact of 
the bomb blast saying naturally the sensation of shock was 
there 
he said he believed the bombers must have had an observation 
post near the site of the attack but told authorities earlier he 
saw no attackers 
neusel called on the red army faction to cease its long campaign 
of terror 
i appeal emphatically for you to give this up he said 
even if you were successful how would that have changed the fact 
that we are a free democracy

nelson mandela today denied 
government claims that anc members had plotted to overthrow 
president fw de klerk but said he would meet again with de klerk 
to discuss the allegations 
south africas police chief said today he expected more arrests 
of anc and communist activists for stockpiling weapons if talks 
fail on powersharing 
de klerk met for more than two hours with mandela on thursday 
night apparently seeking to persuade him that communists within 
the african national congress have been plotting a coup 
news reports said de klerk presented police evidence of a such a 
conspiracy to mandela but that the anc deputy president wasnt 
convinced by it 
there is no plot as far as were concerned mandela said 
during an appearance today at a nursery school in the township of 
soweto he said he would meet with de klerk again wednesday to 
discuss the government accusations 
anc spokesman pallo jordan told a news conference that during 
the meeting with mandela de klerk had expressed the governments 
preference for the exclusion of communist party leader joe slovo 
from aug 6 negotiations between the anc and the governments 
cabinet 
jordan said the ancs national executive committee would discuss 
de klerks request at its meetings saturday through monday he said 
mandela had no power to remove someone from the ancs delegation 
but he can make suggestions 
the anc is allied to the south african communist party with 
many senior communists including slovo holding top anc posts 
the newspaper business day today reported that police had seized 
records of a communist meeting at which slovo allegedly said the 
party would not be bound by any ceasefire between the anc and the 
government 
another senior anc official mac maharaj is among 40 anc 
members who have been detained in recent weeks by police under the 
internal security act the act allows police to hold detainees 
indefinitely in solitary confinement without access to lawyers 
and to interrogate suspects until they provide satisfactory 
answers 
the countrys police chief gen johan van der merwe said the 
detentions had yielded considerable evidence of a conspirarcy in 
an interview with the staterun south african broadcasting corp 
van der merwe said more arrests were likely but gave no details 
a police statement said the militants had been arrested recently 
because of information about an alleged conspiracy by the 
communist party and the ancs military wing to overthrow the 
government by force if negotiations with the government failed 
the leader of the opposition proapartheid conservative party 
andries treurnicht demanded the government end talks with the anc 
in a statement today treurnicht said the anc had no interest in a 
political settlement but was determined to seize power 
the talks aug 6 are aimed at removing barriers to fullscale 
negotiations on ending whiteminority rule the anc is insisting 
the government release all political prisoners and other 
conditions while the government wants the anc to agree to a 
ceasefire 
mandela says the anc would accept a ceasefire when its 
conditions for talks are met the ancs guerrilla campaign is 
virtually at a standstill but the anc sees a ceasefire as a 
bargaining chip to force concessions 
communist party spokesman jeremy cronin told reporters thursday 
that the arrests were part of a government effort to derail a rally 
sunday marking the partys emergence as a legal political group 
after years being banned

two consumer groups want the government to ban 
use of allterrain vehicles by children and say people who bought 
them for anyone under 16 should get their money back 
the groups said thursday an agreement between the consumer 
product safety commission and atv manufacturers has failed to 
adequately reduce the risk to consumers 
since the core problems is that children lack the 
developmental skills and maturity needed to operate any atv safely 
children must be kept off these vehicles said the consumer 
federation of america and the us public interest research group 
in a petition to be submitted to the commission 
in 1988 five atv manufacturers honda kawasaki suzuki 
yamaha and polaris agreed to ban sales of threewheel atvs in the 
united states for 10 years the consumer groups want a permanent 
ban on threewheelers 
the manufacturers also agreed to restrict sales of adultsize 
fourwheelers with engines 90 cubic centimeters or greater for use 
by people over 16 
our nationwide survey of atv dealers and a separate cpsc 
survey both found that atv dealers are willing to sell adultsize 
atvs to children added lucinda sikes an attorney with public 
interest research group 
surveys last year by that group and the commission found that 
more than half of atv dealers were ignoring the sales restrictions 
and adultsized vehicles could be obtained for young children 
however the agency said earlier this month that three of the 
manufacturers had further agreed to conduct routine dealer 
inspections and discipline dealers including termination of 
franchises to ensure compliance with the earlier decree

north and south korea failed to agree 
today on conditions to permit five north koreans to cross the 
border and the event was canceled for the second time in two days 
south korean authorities said the five had left the border 
village of panmunjom and they did not expect them to return the 
dispute increased the hostility between the nations just as they 
were planning an unprecedented meeting of prime ministers to ease 
tensions 
today was the 37th anniversary of the truce that ended fighting 
in the 195053 korean war which started when communist north korea 
invaded the south 
us troops have been stationed in south korea to deter further 
communist aggression and many radicals consider their presence an 
obstacle to reunifying the peninsula it was divided in 1945 
outside the main us military installation near central seoul 
13 radical students yelling withdraw us troops were arrested 
today after they staged a protest 
in another rally at a city park 200 radical students and 
dissidents chanted yankee go home they demanded the withdrawal 
of the 43000 american soldiers in south korea and nuclear weapons 
they claim are kept in korea 
south korean officials said it was probably a coincidence the 
five north koreans tried to cross the border again on the armistice 
anniversary the five were invited to seoul to participate in a 
twoday meeting aimed at planning a joint northsouth unification 
rally 
it would have been the first civilian crossing approved by both 
nations since 1985 both governments must approve such crossings 
because the border is heavily guarded and inaccessible to average 
citizens 
the dispute involved the northerners accomodations during their 
planned visit south koreas government demanded they stay in a 
seoul hotel citing security the civilians wanted to stay with 
south korean dissidents 
north korea charged the south with trying to block plans for the 
joint rally the south charged the north with purposely creating a 
controversy over the arrangements 
the crossing originally was planned thursday and was expected to 
coincide with the signing of a historic agreement to have the prime 
ministers of north and south korea meet for the first time in an 
effort to improve relations 
those talks are scheduled sept 47 in seoul but comments by 
the north indicated they could be canceled because of the border 
controversy 
north koreas chief delegate at the signing paik nam jun 
warned thursday that if the two nations experienced difficulty 
in setting up the joint unification rally relations of the south 
and north would further deteriorate he said it would have an 
irreparably bad impact on the holding of the highlevel talks 
north korea said today your insincere attitude has set a bad 
precedent in relations of the north and south and will create 
regrettable consequences

burmas military rulers today announced 
more delays in turning over power to the prodemocracy party that 
won elections two months ago and a diplomat said troops were 
deployed in the capital 
the government warned it would take action against any attempt 
to adopt any interim constitution and government 
a western diplomat said large numbers of soldiers were 
patrolling rangoon the capital in what he said was obviously an 
attempt to prevent any reaction to the governments announcement 
the diplomat reached by telephone from thailand called todays 
moves the clearest indication yet that the army intends to keep its 
grip on power despite its election loss to the opposition national 
league for democracy 
in effect it is an attempt to negate or destroy or deprive the 
election of all meaning said the diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the may 27 parliamentary elections were burmas first free vote 
in 30 years and the opposition won overwhelmingly but the 
miltitary rulers have refused to set a timetable for turning over 
power and have refused to free the national league for democracys 
top leader from house arrest 
earlier the military authorities had said that the only barrier 
to transferring power was the drafting of the constitution by the 
parliament 
today though the government said it would convene a national 
conference to set up guidelines for the newly elected parliament to 
draft the new constitution then hold a national vote on the draft 
constitution 
only when the people approve the constitution by the 
referendum the military government will adopt the same as the 
national constitution said government spokesman kyaw sann 
he did not say how long these steps were expected to take 
in the past two weeks there have been small antigovernment 
demonstrations in rangoon and the central city of mandalay the 
western diplomat said 
a demonstration in the capital on monday one of the largest 
such rallies in recent months drew about 150 youths he said 
some protesters were reported to have been arrested 
the governments announcement came one day before the opening of 
a conference at which the league was to consider the drafting of a 
new constitution and the transition to democratic rule 
the party seeks an early transfer of power and the release of 
its leader aung san suu kyi who has been under house arrest for 
more than a year authorities accused her of subversion but have 
not filed formal charges 
the diplomat said the government announcement appeared 
deliberately timed to preempt the national leagues conference 
certainly this is going to increase the pressure on the 
league to respond in some fashion he said 
the current military government came to power in 1988 when 
soldiers killed thousands of people demonstrating for democracy

the senate voted today to prevent banks from 
loaning money to the soviet union at a lower rate than to farmers 
unless the funds are used to buy us agricultural products 
the amendment to the 1990 farm bill was approved 6432 as the 
first item of business as the senate began its seventh day of 
debate on the bill that will set agriculture policy for the next 
five years 
the provision offered by sen jesse helms rnc pertains to 
banks savings associations credit unions or any entity that has 
deposits insured by the federal government 
helms during debate thursday on the amendment said lending 
institutions should not be loaning money to the soviets at lower 
rates than to us farmers 
senate leaders say they are moving right along towards final 
passage of the bill despite dozens of unresolved issues 
the last time congress rewrote the nations basic farm law in 
1985 the senate spent a month trying to arrive at final passage 
republican leader bob dole of kansas said 
weve only had 45 hours of debate and were not even up to 
100 amendments yet he said early today 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine called off 
debate thursday when it became clear at midnight that the senators 
were still far from a vote on whether strict economic sanctions 
should be placed against iraq 
he read off a long list of amendments on issues ranging from 
paperwork reduction to loans to the soviet union that still had not 
been resolved senators then began mentioning others they planned 
to offer 
sen howell heflin dala said he had an amendment 
to what does it pertain asked mitchell 
farming heflin said causing titters through the chamber 
were all in a good mood now mitchell said smiling 
himself but then he began to scold 
the senates lengthy hours are a consequence of action by 
senators but sometimes you wouldnt know it by whats happening 
here said the majority leader the likelihood of another late 
night tomorrow and saturday is increasing with each amendment 
earlier in the evening when a debate over cargo preference had 
droned on for more than two hours agriculture committee chairman 
patrick leahy dvt bemoaned the snag 
i would like to spend some of the nonsleeping hours someplace 
besides this wonderful chamber said leahy who has been managing 
debate on the bill for the democrats i have counted the stars on 
the ceiling the panels the lights and the number of members of 
the press 
thursday was the third consecutive day in which debate lasted 
late into the night 
an amendment to the bill offered by sen thomas daschle dsd 
was passed earlier in the day that would preserve the crop 
insurance program 
the amendment provides for the program to be funded through the 
commodity credit corp if money earmarked specifically for crop 
insurance is phased out as directed by a vote of the house 
the bush administration which wants the insurance program 
abolished estimated that it would cost 601 million in 1991 if 
continued at its present level the administration eliminated it 
from its budget request 
daschle said his cropinsurance provision respons to the 
troubling situation that has developed over in the house 
the house stripped funds from the program last week over the 
objections of its agriculture committee which has been studying 
ways to improve the program and increase participation 
common complaints by farmers about crop insurance include that 
premiums are too expensive and that payments can be inadequate when 
disaster strikes only about 40 percent of the eligible farmers 
participate in the program 
whats killed the cropinsurance program has been total 
mismanagement of the program said sen thomas harkin diowa 
ive never seen a program so mismanaged from washington dc in 
my life 
sen christopher bond rmo tried unsuccessfully to phase out 
the crop insurance over three years though several changes he 
suggested for the program were adopted along with the daschle 
proposal 
the farm bill estimated to cost 54 billion over five years 
establishes pricesupport programs for commodities and sets policy 
for nutrition programs agricultural exports soil and water 
conservation agricultural research and extension work food 
inspection and other responsibilities of the agriculture department 
in other action the senate 
increased the payment limit to wool and mohair producers from 
the 50000 in the original bill to 250000 the house on a voice 
vote wednesday approved an amendment that sets payments per 
producer at 200000 in 1991 167000 in 1992 133000 in the 
1993 and 100000 in 1994 
approved an amendment to give special attention to improving 
conditions for minority farmers who through the years have become a 
smaller and smaller part of the agriculture industry

an american rabbi today accused police of 
trying to suffocate him and of punching an associate after their 
arrest in a protest against president kurt waldheim 
rabbi avi weiss and the associate jacob davidson shouted 
shame for meeting nazi waldheim as visiting presidents richard 
von weizsaecker of west germany and vaclav havel of czechoslovakia 
shook hands with waldheim wednesday 
although private the visits were interpreted by some as a 
gesture of support for waldheim who has been boycotted by most 
heads of state for covering up his past as an intelligence officer 
in the german army during world war ii 
after their shouts weiss and davidson were quickly subdued by 
security agents and dragged into a small room a third american 
jewish activist involved in the protest was not arrested 
they forced me to lie prostrate face down then they took the 
jacket and pulled it over my face so i could hardly breathe for 
many seconds weiss said in a telephone interview 
he said he yelled and then was allowed to get up again he said 
the situation was all the more precarious for him because he had 
previously undergone heart bypass surgery davidson was also forced 
to lie on the floor and punched in his chest weiss said 
this is unseemly absolutely outrageous he said 
the police did not immediately respond to the rabbis claims

one day after halting its verbal attacks on 
kuwait over oil production and disputed border lines the iraqi 
government renewed its demands today calling on kuwait to 
recognize baghdads legitimate rights 
the official iraqi news agency carried a statement from an 
unidentified spokesman saying kuwait must send representatives to 
baghdad to resolve the issues that divide them there was no 
immediate response from kuwait 
ina said a meeting scheduled in saudi arabia in the next few 
days between izzat ibrahim vice chairman of the iraqi 
revolutionary command council and sheik saad alabdullah alsabah 
of kuwait is only a preliminary step 
the news agency said it will be a protocol meeting and will be 
followed by a meeting between them in baghdad to resume the 
negotiations 
it is necessary that the prime minister of kuwait know that 
whoever comes to the meeting with us should be prepared to remove 
the harm and aggression suffered by iraq and respond to iraqs 
legitimate rights the spokesman said 
in washington today the senate voted today to impose harsh 
economic sanctions on iraq including an end to the 12 billion in 
loan guarantees baghdad now receives to buy us farm and 
commercial products 
the vote on an amendment to the 1990 farm bill was the latest 
sign of congressional worry over iraqs increasingly threatening 
stance in the volatile middle east 
before the 8016 vote lawmakers cited concern about iraqi human 
rights violations but farmstate interests indicated they might 
try to water down the sanctions before the bills final passage 
on thursday iraq scaled back a weeklong intimidation campaign 
against kuwait after gaining concessions at an opec meeting to end 
violations of production quotas set by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 
the threats started just before the opec meeting that began 
thursday in geneva to set prices and production levels for the rest 
of the year 
the opec ministers met today to complete the details of a new 
accord designed to restrain oil production and lift crude prices 
above 20 a barrel the current target price is 18 but slipped 4 
to 5 due to a world oil glut 
it was not immediately clear if the renewed iraqi pressure on 
kuwait was linked to the opec bargaining 
diplomatic sources based in the persian gulf said iraq had 
agreed to pull some of the estimated 30000 troops it reportedly 
deployed back from the countries disputed border starting at dawn 
thursday 
travelers returning from the border area said there were fewer 
weapons on display and that convoys of troops were headed north 
kuwait had insisted that iraq withdraw forces massed at the 
100mile border and stop the propaganda campaign before kuwait 
would sit down for negotiations this weekend the diplomatic 
sources said 
iraqi newspaper officials said they received instructions from 
the ministry of information on wednesday night to halt attacks on 
kuwait as part of an agreement to defuse the crisis 
although the spokesman quoted today did not say what he meant by 
iraqs legitimate rights the nations demands are well known 
president hussein saddam claims kuwait and the united arab 
emirates deprived his nation of 14 billion in revenue by 
depressing the international price of crude oil he also wants 
kuwait to compensate iraq for 24 billion worth of oil he claims 
was stolen since 1980 from an oil field along the countries 
disputed border the disputed rumaila oil field extends two miles 
into kuwait but iraq claims it owns the entire field 
with an estimated 70 billion in debts from the iraniraq war 
saddam faces increasing grumbling at home over economic conditions 
iraq is dependent on oil revenues to pay its debuts and fund 
reconstruction

a mother collapsed on the witness stand 
and had to be carried from the courtroom today after testifying in 
defense of her son who is charged with fatally plunging a toddler 
headfirst into a toilet 
mary coes collapse came after she had completed direct 
questioning in thomas coes firstdegree murder and aggravated 
child abuse trial in the death of his 2yearold stepson bradley 
mcgee 
but as crossexamination was to begin she asked for paramedics 
to be standing by because she was not feeling well 
she soon collapsed and the proceedings were stopped paramedics 
treated her at the lee county justice center before she was carried 
out on a stretcher her condition was not immediately known 
at the time the judge was listening to her testimony with the 
jurors out of the room 
coe 23 is charged with murder and aggravated child abuse in 
the death of bradley one year ago this week prosecutors are 
seeking the death penalty 
coe has admitted dunking the boy headfirst into the toilet 
saying it was punishment for soiling his pants the toddler died 
the next day of head injures 
defense attorneys argue that he should be convicted of a lesser 
crime because it was a onetime form of punishment and there was 
never any intent to harm the child 
bradleys death came two months after social workers recommended 
to a judge that he be returned from foster care to his mother 
sheryl coe and stepfather the death lead to a change in state 
policy toward foster care and charges against several child welfare 
workers most of whom were acquitted 
mrs coe 21 pleaded no contest to seconddegree murder and 
aggravated child abuse and is serving a 30year term

rescuers alerted by cries of help 
us today pulled two survivors from the rubble of a hotel 11 days 
after it collapsed in an earthquake that killed more than 1600 
people 
rescuers and spectators cheered as luisa mallorca was pulled 
from the wreckage of the hyatt hotel at about 950 pm 850 am 
edt arnel calabia was recovered about an hour later 
foreign rescue teams gave up the search for survivors last week 
but filipino miners and other volunteers had vowed to search until 
all the missing were accounted for 
doctors said calabia a hotel security guard and ms mallorca 
a cleaning woman were in surprisingly good condition 
in a radio interview calabia said he ms mallorca and another 
man dived under tables when the quake struck and then the 
ceiling fell in 
we recovered consciousness later and we called out to each 
other calabia said he said the third person died about four 
days ago 
i was okay where i was but i realized just a while ago that 
there was a concrete slab above my forehead he said just a 
few more inches and i would have been dead too 
the two were being treated at baguia general hospital doctors 
said they suffered cuts and bruises and severe dehydration 
calabia said his hand was injured and that a nurse warned that 
three of his fingers may have to be amputated ms mallorca 
complained of chest pains 
both are employees of the staterun philippine amusement and 
gaming corp which operated a casino in the luxury hotel they 
were found in rubble of the second floor of the 12story building 
workers returned to the site to search for others who might 
still be alive 
miners said they heard cries of help us help us late 
today after boring for five hours rescuers said they reached the 
hotel elevator shaft and found ms mallorca pinned beneath a beam 
calabia was found in the same general area lying next to four 
bodies 
last week foreign rescue teams abandoned the search for 
survivors of the massive quake which struck july 16 and measured 
77 on the richter scale baguio about 130 miles north of manila 
was one of the cities hit hardest 
officials believe there are more than 20 people still 
unaccounted for in the hyatt one of eight hotels that collapsed 
during the quake 
in october a california longshoreman was pulled from beneath 
tons of wreckage of an oakland freeway that had collapsed four days 
earlier in an earthquake buck helm had suffered injuries to 
virtually every organ in his body when his compact car was crushed 
under interstate 880 he died 28 days after his rescue which came 
after workers had given up hope of finding any more survivors 
according to the latest figures the philippines earthquake left 
at least 1653 people dead 1000 missing and presumed dead 3000 
seriously injured and 110000 homeless it was the strongest to 
strike the philippines in 14 years nearly 400 people were killed 
in baguio 
the air force chief today ordered gunships and rocketfiring 
planes to escort helicopters carrying relief supplies to villages 
stricken by the quake the order follows guerrilla attacks on two 
helicopters 
the military said the guerrilla fire wednesday over the town of 
kayapa represented a violation of the rebels unilateral ceasefire 
in areas hit by the july 16 earthquake 
we will go on with our mission despite gunfire from the npa 
maj gen gerardo protacio said referring to the communist new 
peoples army guerrillas 
an air force spokesman col avelino abiol said he was aboard

the senate voted today to slap harsh economic 
sanctions on iraq including an end to the 12 billion in loan 
guarantees baghdad now receives to buy us farm and commercial 
products 
the 8016 vote came on an amendment to the 1990 farm bill 
offered by sen alfonse damato rny it was the latest sign of 
congressional worry over iraqs increasingly threatening stance in 
the volatile middle east 
senators underscored the action a short time later by killing 
5738 an attempt by farmstate colleagues to water down the 
sanctions and avoid the loss of a 1 billion market for wheat rice 
and other commodities 
in the house which was considering its own version of the farm 
bill action was expected today on a similar amendment to eliminate 
us agricultural credit guarantees to iraq 
at the same time government sources said the bush 
administration was seriously considering a range of options for 
action against iraq which could signal us displeasure without 
totally alienating president saddam hussein 
options under consideration included putting iraq back on the 
us list of terrorist nations which would end commodity loan 
guarantees and exportimport bank credits for purchase of american 
industrial goods and more limited tightening of restrictions on 
us exports 
this is a freight train coming down the track from congress 
said one senior administration official speaking only on condition 
of anonymity there is plenty of impetus the question becomes 
do we want to be active or let capitol hill do it to us 
the house foreign affairs committee scheduled action for next 
week on a bill drafted by rep howard berman dcalif that would 
impose a similar list of sanctions on iraq still other sanctions 
were contained in an export administration act pending on the 
senate calendar 
the state department has described iraqs human rights record as 
abysmal concerns also have mounted over the countrys 
development of chemical and nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver 
them hussein also has made direct threats against israel in recent 
months and early this week massed troops on the border with kuwait 
damato had offered his sanctions legislation as an amendment to 
another bill in may but had withdrawn it in order to hold hearings 
on the proposal the administration testified against the bill at 
hearings on june 15 but damato picked up support from colleagues 
including sen nancy kassebaum rkan who backed it even though 
it might hurt sales of kansas wheat 
the amendment would revoke credit guarantees of up to 1 billion 
a year that iraq now uses to buy rice wheat timber cattle and a 
200 million line of credit for commercial goods through the 
exportimport bank it also would bar sales of weapons 
hightechnology goods and items that could have a military use 
it is time we stop talking and take action against iraq 
damato said we should not give to the iraqis the kind of 
treatment you reserve for friends for allies 
sen richard lugar rind a senior member of the foreign 
relations committee said the sanctions would badly undercut any 
possibility we have of influencing iraqi behavior they will more 
likely respond angrily and defiantly and he said it would cut 
into important farm exports 
but kassebaum said serious human rights violations by iraq make 
those considerations less important 
i cant believe any farmer in this nation would want to send 
his products under subsidized sales to a country that has used 
chemical weapons and a country that has tortured and executed its 
children in order to force their families into compliance with the 
government she said

the defense rested its case today in marion 
barrys cocaine and perjury trial after the mayor decided not to 
take the witness stand 
i have advised mr barry that no matter how we restrict his 
testimony he would still be subject to crossexamination r 
kenneth mundy one of barrys lawyers told the court 
this is a matter we have considered extensively and it is 
his informed decision that he will not take the stand said mundy 
the trial on 14 criminal charges is in its sixth week of 
testimony and the prosecution plans to conclude today or monday by 
calling several rebuttal witnesses 
final arguments and instructions to the jury will follow tuesday 
or wednesday 
barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession three 
counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy 
mundy ended his case by grilling the fbi agent whose sting 
operation videotaped the mayor smoking crack cocaine 
agent ronald stern should have stopped the jan 18 sting against 
barry before he smoked the crack said mundy 
what would you suggest i say to rasheeda stern retorted 
the stings off throw away the drugs 
stern was referring to exmodel rasheeda moore a former barry 
girlfriend who persuaded barry to come to her hotel room an 
undercover agent posing as moores friend supplied the crack while 
stern monitored the sting from the next room 
stern repeatedly insisted that it was barry not moore who 
brought up the subject of drugs and asked for them 
on thursday mundy said the fbi had targeted andrew young 
julian bond and other black leaders for undercover sting operations 
stern in effect moves around the country as the head of an 
assault force of fbi agents mundy said out of the presence of 
the jury 
there is absolutely no truth to the allegation responded 
assistant us attorney judith retchin 
stern is not part of a roving band retchin told the judge 
in the barry trial before the jury was called into the courtroom 
this morning 
mundy had asserted that prior to coming here to organize and 
orchestrate the sting against mr barry mr stern had been in 
atlanta trying to set up a sting of julian bond andrew young and 
two other black politicians and public figures in atlanta 
we stand on the representations we made mundy told the 
court today after retchins comments 
he said the information is based on five different sources 
mundy said they include two attorneys for witnesses in the barry 
case one of whom provided an affidavit on the matter 
another is a person to whom stern in an unguarded moment 
mentioned his activities said mundy 
in addition mundy said today we received a letter making 
certain representations 
on thursday mundy said some of the information also came from a 
former fbi informant from a congressional office and from a figure 
convicted in the hud scandal 
barrys lawyers were prohibited from questioning stern in front 
of the jury about the allegation us district court judge thomas 
penfield jackson ruled that the defense would be prohibited from 
presenting evidence that barry was a target of selective 
prosecution 
mundy said he wanted to put the information on the record in 
case the court of appeals would inquire as to what other things 
we would have gone into had we been permitted retchin said she 
also wanted to make the record clear in case of a possible appeal

a court has overturned the murder conviction of a 
44yearold man 18 years after he was first found guilty and sent 
to prison to be executed he was immediately freed 
the nagoya high court in a ruling announced friday found norio 
shimogami guilty of the less serious charge of attempted armed 
robbery resulting in injuries and sentenced him to eight years in 
prison 
but since shimogami had already served 18 years on the murder 
charge he was released after his recent retrial said court 
officials in nagoya in central japan 
shimogami was arrested in june 1972 on charges of murdering a 
taxi driver 
courts had previously found him guilty and sentenced him to die 
on a murder charge based on a confession made by his alleged 
accomplice who has served an eightyear prison term 
but a threejudge panel in the retrial said the confession by 
the alleged accomplice was insufficient proof of shimogamis guilt 
prosecutors said they would decide in two weeks whether to ask for 
yet another retrial 
the supreme court ordered the retrial by the high court in june 
last year

gov buddy roemer announced today that 
he has vetoed what would have been the nations toughest state 
abortion law a measure thrown together in the final days of a 
tumultuous session of the louisiana legislature 
i vetoed this bill because it does not meet even the minimum 
standards set forth by me long ago roemer said reading from a 
statement 
roemer has long insisted that any antiabortion bill must 
contain exceptions for rape and incest the rape exception in the 
bill he vetoed wasnt strong enough he said 
a leading abortion opponent immediately said he would seek a 
special session to override the governor 
roemer said he had supported much of the bill but that rape is 
treated unevenly and unsatisfactorily 
the bill would have had doctors who perform abortions face 
sentences of up to 10 years at hard labor and fines of up to 
100000 it was designed pave the way for a court case to 
challenge the 1973 supreme court decision that legalized abortion 
nancy myers spokeswoman for national right to life committee 
said roemer betrayed the prolife majority that elected him gov 
roemer has abandoned thousand of unborn children 
she accused him of using phony excuses to hide the fact that 
he doesnt care at all for unborn children 
but joy gilmore president of the state chapter of the national 
organization for women called roemers decision rational and 
reasonable and said it sends a clear and distinctive message 
that the power of the prochoice majority cannot be denied 
lawmakers put the bill together july 8 the day before the 
session ended by amending antiabortion language onto an unrelated 
antiflagburning bill they did so after failing by three votes to 
override roemers veto of an even tougher antiabortion bill passed 
earlier in the session 
roemer said he had vetoed the first bill because it lacked 
exceptions for rape or incest 
even before announcing his veto of the second bill today roemer 
had complained that the new measure would require rape victims in 
order to gain permission for an abortion to report the crime and 
seek medical treatment to prevent conception within seven days of 
the rape 
the bills opponents also noted it doesnt allow abortions of 
pregnancies resulting from simple rape defined in louisiana 
law as sexual intercourse when a woman is incapable of resisting 
for instance if she is intoxicated 
roemer repeated today that he considers himself an abortion 
opponent adding abortion on demand and as a substitute for 
birth control must be in the name of the unborn sharply 
controlled but he said most citizens he talked to around the 
state agreed with him that some commonsense decent exceptions 
should be made 
shortly after the veto was announced rep woody jenkins 
dbaton rouge a key abortion opponent said he would ask the 
legislature to come back into session next month and would first 
seek once again to override the original bill 
jenkins noted that under louisianas constitution if the 
lawmakers approve a veto session all bills vetoed by the governor 
are automatically eligible for consideration 
under the law a veto session is held 40 days after the end of 
the regular session if a majority of both houses agrees 
for a veto to be nullified more than twothirds of each house 
must approve the override the measure that was vetoed today 
unlike the measure that roemer vetoed earlier was passed in both 
legislative chambers with more than the twothirds majorities 
nevertheless override opponents have history on their side in 
one respect no louisiana governors veto has been overridden this 
century

a former vice president today claimed 
kenyas government is corrupt and he demanded the resignation of 
its leaders the dissolution of parliament and multiparty elections 
the scathing criticism of president daniel arap moi comes as the 
government is cracking down on opposition activists in the wake of 
a series of antigovernment protests 
in an open letter 81yearold ajuma oginga odinga denounced 
mois government as unpopular authoritarian and bent on acts of 
suppression and arrogant insensitivity to public opinion and 
demands 
he called parliament a creature of rigged elections that is 
no better than an orchestra of blind and deaf cheerleaders 
odingas letter which was made available to news organizations 
follows six months of increasingly heated debate over political 
pluralism in this east africa nation 
kenya has been a oneparty state by law since 1982 but in 
reality has had only one party since 1969 when the last opposition 
party led by odinga was banned 
riots in early july left at least 28 dead and at least six of 
the governments most prominent critics have been detained 
including odingas son 
raila odinga a businessman twice before detained for a total of 
six years was picked up along with five others days before a 
banned promultiparty rally on july 7 when authorities acted to 
prevent the rally riots occurred in nairobi and four other major 
towns and rural areas 
among the six detained without charge were three lawyers who 
were released wednesday after being held for 20 days but one of 
them the editor of a law review was immediately arrested again 
and charged with sedition 
still being held without charge are former cabinet ministers 
charles rubia and kenneth matiba plus raila odinga matiba and 
rubia had proposed the july 7 rally 
in his letter odinga condemned the detention without trial of 
many kenyan citizens and the spate of harassment and killing of 
innocent kenyans in the wake of their legitimate demands for 
democracy justice and equality 
if detention without trial is not right in south africa it 
cannot have a basis in a free and supposedly democratic republic 
like kenya odinga wrote 
odinga as have other critics accused mois government of 
amending the constitution to eliminate the independence of the 
judiciary the attorney general and the office of the 
auditorgeneral which is supposed to serve as a watchdog against 
corruption 
the former vice president also suggested the government may be 
trying to suppress a scotland yard report of an investigation of 
the killing last february of foreign minister robert ouko 
the mysterious death also touched off an outbreak of violence in 
nairobi and elsewhere with some accusing the government of 
involvement in the slaying 
moi other kenyan leaders and their supporters argue that more 
than one political party could lead to conflict among the nations 
approximately 40 tribes 
odinga who is in frail health was vice president under kenyas 
first and only other president jomo kenyatta he broke with 
kenyatta in 1966 and formed an opposition party 
in 1969 kenyatta was heckled and authorities later claimed 
stoned at a political rally in western kenya the homeland of 
odingas luo tribe the presidents bodyguards opened fire and 12 
people were killed 
the next day kenyatta had odinga arrested and his party banned 
the former vice president served two years in detention before 
being freed in 1971

presidentelect alberto fujimori takes office 
saturday inheriting a nation that is bankrupt blackedout and 
ravaged by drought and war how he will cope remains a mystery 
fujimoris team of advisers has been wracked by dissension and 
defections only days before the inauguration fujimori was 
scrambling to put together both a government and a plan with which 
to govern 
fujimoris good intention of selecting the best from each 
party may end in disaster because the best may not want to join a 
government without welldefined aims the magazine caretas said 
fujimoris government will face immense problems 
inflation tops 3000 percent a year four of five people lack 
steady work the central bank has no dollars and has sold almost 
all its gold bread is rationed provincial gas stations are dry 
guerrilla violence is at an alltime high maoist shining path 
rebels control much of perus andean mountains and amazonian 
jungle the procuban tupac amaru revolutionary movement recently 
staged a spectacular breakout from limas maximumsecurity prison 
the worst drought to hit peru this century has devastated crops 
and drastically cut limas water supply hydroelectric plants run 
at half capacity the daily blackouts have paralyzed industry 
a usbacked plan to fight the trade in coca leaves the raw 
material of cocaine threatens to deprive peru of its top export 
the country earns 1 billion a year from the coca trade which 
directly employs about 200000 people in this country of 2 million 
to reverse this economic collapse fujimori has proposed drastic 
measures he says they will include a major devaluation of perus 
inti the end of price subsidies privatization of many state 
companies and emergency taxes on the rich 
soon after his june 10 landslide victory over novelist mario 
vargas llosa fujimori traveled to the united states and japan 
seeking economic aid 
in new york he met with the heads of the international monetary 
fund and the world bank outgoing president alan garcia cut ties 
with these organizations four years ago fujimori hopes to receive 
loans in return for implementing an imfapproved austerity plan 
but fujimoris plan has met with strong domestic opposition 
this is due largely to fujimoris own condemnation of such a 
shock program during his campaign against vargas llosa 
within fujimoris change 90 party one camp favors a drastic 
economic shock and another favors a more gradual approach many 
believe this conflict has resulted in chaos 
the partys organizational structure has disintegrated 
economist daniel schydlowsky said a professor at boston 
university schydlowsky resigned last week along with two other top 
fujimori advisers 
theres no time to put together a program and no team to do 
so schydlowsky told the lima daily la republica 
when fujimori finally named 11 of his 14 ministers last week 
none belonged to change 90 most were independents with a 
sprinkling of people from perus strong left and rightwing 
parties 
what awaits us is an intermediate zigzagging path said 
manuel dornellas a political commentator after fujimori named 
his cabinet it will be neither shock nor gradualism 
an unprecedented three ministries defense interior and 
fisheries went to military officers most analysts view this as a 
sign of fujimoris weakness 
fujimoris opponents showed little inclination to help the 
presidentelect form what he had wanted to be a concensus 
cabinet 
the centerright popular action party forced juan carlos hurtado 
miller to resign his membership when he became fujimoris prime 
minister and economy minister the marxist united left coalition 
attacked member gloria helfer for becoming education minister 
with the support of neither the left nor right fujimori will 
have a hard time imposing his plan change 90 holds fewer 
congressional seats than either vargas llosas democratic front 
coalition or garcias aprista party 
peru has a strong presidency and fujimori will be able to 
govern partly by decree but many of his plans will require 
congressional support which means he will have to form some sort 
of alliance 
but fernando belaunde terry twice perus president and de facto 
leader of the centerright congressional faction says his group 
was elected to the opposition 
and on the left garcia has made clear he will stick to his 
populist positions rather than help a fujimori government impose 
austerity measures 
one may have grave problems managing the economy but this 
doesnt mean one should yield to the right or to imperialism what 
is important is to stand firm with the poor garcia said i am 
sure these adjustments will not take place

with two rollsroyces and a net worth put at 
370 million joseph hardy sr has some trappings of nobility 
but it wasnt until thursday that the western pennsylvania 
businessman could say he was a lord of the manor 
thats when hardy and his wife purchased a title at a london 
auction for 187000 
now hardy is lord of the manor of henleyinarden in 
warwickshire the title doesnt qualify the founder of 84 lumber 
co to a seat in the house of lords but that doesnt bother his 
wife dottie 
its an interesting path to go down that we hadnt traveled 
she told the pittsburgh postgazette by telephone from london we 
thought we might want to try learning a new way of life a 
little bit about the history of england 
hardy who also owns a resort gains certain rights with his 
lordship including the authority to preside at henley court leet 
an annual gathering each november with the macebearer aletaster 
and butterweigher 
the title which dates to the 11th century allows hardy to use 
the manors coat of arms on his letterhead 
i think its very weird to tell you the truth mrs hardy 
said we came over for a holiday we just happened to be here 
when they held the auction

a aries rocket carrying 
an electronics payload to be tested for the star wars program went 
off course and was destroyed 31 seconds after it lifted off 
authorities said today 
this will not set back the star wars program said maj 
bill oconnell of the strategic defense initiative organization in 
washington dc 
he estimated the loss at about 20 million 
debbie bingham a spokeswoman at white sands missile range said 
the singlestate rocket was launched about 1150 pm wednesday 
from white sands but a problem quickly developed that forced the 
flight to be aborted 
it was veering off course she said everything stayed 
within the boundaries of the range 
investigators will try to determine the cause of the problem 
bingham said 
the payload sponsored by the defense nuclear agency and the 
sdio consisted of electronic components that were to undergo 
testing in space officials said the components had undergone 
testing on the ground oconnell said 
the rocket had been scheduled to lift off a week ago but 
oconnell said weather and other problems delayed the suborbital 
flight until wednesday 
the star wars program known formally as the strategic defense 
initiative is a research effort to develop lasers and other exotic 
weapons that could automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired 
at the united states

the united states flying 
nuclear arms command post is no longer in the air 24 hours a day 
the strategic air command said today 
in a budgetcutting move that recognizes thawing superpower 
relations sac scaled back flights for the operation known as 
looking glass this week of the mission that had flown 
continuously since 1961 officials said 
sac said it modified the looking glass mission by putting the 
airplanes on ground alert and flying them randomly a few times each 
week 
the last of the 24houraday flights ended at 228 pm cdt 
tuesday said lt col george peck a sac spokesman 
in this time of budget crunch it was the right thing to do 
peck said 
it makes good sense to put it on an alert status instead of 
constantly in the air where the world situation is such that 
keeping continuously airborne is perhaps not as critical as in the 
past he said 
looking glass had flown continuously since feb 2 1961 
sac expects the change to save about 18 million in the 1991 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 peck said about 23 million should 
be saved the following year he said most of the savings will come 
from reduced fuel and maintenance costs he said 
the mission is dubbed looking glass because it mirrors the 
capability of sacs underground command center it would perform 
the command and control functions if something happened to the sac 
headquarters at offutt air force base near omaha 
the roles and responsibilities of the looking glass have not 
changed only the alert posture a sac statement said 
sac maintains the capability to launch the looking glass into 
a continuous airborne alert posture within minutes should strategic 
or tactical warning warrant 
looking glass flights include a crew of 31 three who operate 
the plane and 28 who work in the airborne command center including 
an air force general peck said 
now the crew will in a building nearby when the looking glass 
flight is not in the air he said 
recent changes in eastern europe were not directly responsible 
for the decision to modify the roundtheclock flights but world 
events contributed to the decision peck said 
improved us intelligence capabilities and the resulting 
increased warning time of any attack also were factors in the 
decision to change looking glass he said

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said 
friday that irans cooperation with its wartime enemy iraq had 
helped boost oil prices tehran radio reported 
in geneva the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
including iran and iraq agreed friday to increase the benchmark 
price of crude oil from 18 to 21 per barrel 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted rafsanjani as joining 
iraq in criticizing fellow persian gulf states for violating opec 
production quotas 
two or three countries in the persian gulf have committed a 
great treason due to their dependence on the west rafsanjani 
said 
speaking at prayers in tehran rafsanjani did not name the 
countries but added they have inflicted an atrocity on the arab 
world 
his remarks supported a vehement attack by iraqi president 
saddam hussein last week on kuwait and the united arab emirates 
saddam blasted the two gulf states for violating opec production 
quotas 
he claimed the violations had cost iraq 14 billion in lost 
revenues this year when overproduction by the two fellow arab 
countries helped push oil prices below 14 per barrel 
since the august 1988 ceasefire in their eightyear war iran 
and iraq have been trying to rebuild their countries inflicting 
heavy strains on their economies they have been strong advocates 
of an oil price hike 
indicating a future improvement in his countrys no war no 
peace situation with baghdad rafsanjani said recently we and 
the iraqis have started talking to each other writing letters to 
one another and moving in the same direction and look at what 
great change has occurred 
the price of oil has already risen from a low of 14 a barrel 
and in the future will increase even more he added 
rafsanjani said the collapse in prices was tantamont to giving 
oil away to the advanced and industrial countries 
if this oil was in the possession of the colonialist and 
industrially advanced countries they would surely be selling the 
same oil to us at a rate of 100 or 200 per barrel he said 
rafsanjani said low prices only benefited world arrogance 
an iranian label for the united states 
we really hope that the islamic countries particularly our 
neighbors would be more sincere and islamic in this matter and 
would not be willing to commit treachery against the islamic 
nation he said 
that echoed saddams statement that kuwait was working in 
conjunction with the united states to wreck iraqs economy 
efforts between the two countries to sign a formal treaty to end 
the war have been stalemated since the ceasefire 
saddam has proposed a summit with rafsanjani a proposal the 
iranians have not rejected but have said should be preceded by a 
meeting at a lower level 
the iraqi and iranian foreign ministers met in geneva earlier 
this month under un auspices

the bush administration on friday sharply 
rejected fidel castros sarcastic call for us ships to come and 
pick up cubans unhappy with his rule officials expressed worry 
about a possible wave of refugees if cubans take castro seriously 
the state department also said it had officially protested to 
cuba for its accusing the united states of inciting dozens of 
cubans to seek asylum in foreign embassies in havana in recent days 
castro in a lengthy speech thursday night marking the 37th 
anniversary of his revolution spoke of a cuban dissident who had 
said the united states started encouraging the asylum seekers last 
march 
us officials are still haunted by the wave of asylum seekers 
who flooded the peruvian embassy in havana 1980 sparking the 
mariel boatlift in which 125000 cubans fled to the united states 
we have officially protested to the cuban government the 
baseless and irresponsible accusation that the united states 
government is in any way responsible for the crisis or encouraged 
those who are seeking asylum in foreign embassies in havana the 
state department said 
castro beset by severe economic problems and isolated by 
oncecommunist allies in eastern europe accused president bush of 
being obsessed with toppling cubas government and ridding cuba of 
its revolutionary ideology 
in a sarcastic tone castro dared the yankees if they want 
to receive these poor persecuted citizens let them send the boats 
and the visas 
but the state department said it rejects castros attempts to 
export his internal problems to the united states by encouraging 
cubans to leave cubas problems must be resolved at home through 
democratic process and freedom of speech 
officials said they were concerned that many cubans disaffected 
by rising prices shortages and unemployment might take castro up 
on his suggestion that they can leave for the united states 
cubans who wish to leave should do so in accordance with 
established immigration procedures the state department said 
under a 1984 agreement for orderly emigration cubans wishing to 
leave for the united states can go to the us diplomatic mission 
in havana and apply for visas in 1989 for example 10046 cubans 
were allowed to come here as immigrants according to the 
immigration and naturalization service 
the agreement was designed to prevent a recurrence of the 1980 
boatlift in which thousands of criminals and mental patients were 
added to the boats chartered by cubanamericans to pick up their 
relatives and friends at the cuban port of mariel 
hailed at first as an embarrassment for castro and a victory for 
the capitalist way the fivemonth operation became a nightmare 
after the boats landed in the united states placing a stigma on 
the majority of legitimate refugees who wanted to start a new life 
here 
today most experts agree that fewer than 10 percent of the 
125000 marielitos were criminals about 2600 are still in 
federal custody 173 were returned to cuba and an estimated 4000 
are in various state and local prisons

the first nun killed in 21 
years of sectarian violence was buried friday following a message 
from pope john paul ii condemning the grievous injustice and 
futility of terrorism 
political leaders of ireland and northern ireland joined with 
family and friends who packed a small country church along the 
irish border for the requiem mass for sister catherine dunne 37 
she was killed tuesday by an irish republican army bomb 
the mourners included representatives of the royal ulster 
constabulary which lost three men in the same attack william 
hanson 37 joshua cyril willis 35 and david sterritt 34 
the ira has said the killing of the nun was unintentional her 
car had been near the policemens car when the bomb exploded 
a prayer was said for social worker cathy mccann 25 who was in 
the car with sister catherine and is recovering from injuries 
suffered in the explosion 
dean francis mclarnon a roman catholic diocesan administrator 
in armagh read a message from the vatican saying that the pope was 
deeply shocked and saddened by the deaths 
john paul implores gods peace on northern ireland and 
appeals to the men and women who espouse violence to recognize the 
grievous injustice and futility of terrorism the message said 
several hundred people crowded into the old stone church filling 
the aisles and standing along the walls in the gallery and dozens 
more stood outside under umbrellas among them were sister 
catherines parents john and peggy brothers sean and liam and 
sister ann 
girls from st josephs training school where sister catherine 
was deputy director lined the pathway through the church grounds 
many weeping 
following the mass sister catherines coffin was carried 
through the fields to the convent of her st louis religious order 
a mile away for burial 
in his homily mclarnon referred to negotiations now under way 
in northern ireland to bring the main political parties together to 
seek a political settlement 
lets today pray that all who are in a position of influence 
may refrain from strident posturing and may earnestly seek for 
accomodation for agreement for reconciliation 
if this last atrocity can touch minds and hearts it will 
perhaps become a turning point he said 
among those at the funeral were seamus mallon deputy leader of 
the social democratic and labor party the main roman catholic 
party in northern ireland also attending was ken maginnis deputy 
leader of the official unionists the main protestant party 
weve had many other tragedies of the same sort maginnis 
said after the service and for a short while there appeared to 
be hope i dont think we worked hard enough at it the community 
im talking about not exclusively politicians i think people have 
to work a great deal harder 
sister catherine is the 35th victim of political and sectarian 
violence this year in northern ireland on friday less than 15 
miles from her grave police were investigating death no 36 a man 
shot to death at newtonhamilton 
the victim was identified as paddy flood 30 of londonderry 
the ira said he was killed because he was an informer 
police refused to comment on the claim 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to topple british rule in 
northern ireland and join the protestantdominated province with 
the republic of ireland under a leftist administration

president bush today said he 
believes there is broad support for his supreme court nominee 
david souter and predicted the new hampshire jurist would come 
through the senate confirmation process with flying colors 
at the same time bush denied that he had agreed as a 
precondition to the nomination not to ask souter any delicate 
questions on how he might rule on sensitive subjects even though 
the president has said he did not ask souter for his views on 
abortion or other controversial social issues 
sen warren rudman rnh said earlier in the day that souter 
had sought assurances from the white house that he wouldnt be 
asked how he would rule on specific issues before he agreed to be 
screened as a high court candidate 
souter hitchhiked a ride on air force one with the president to 
pease air force base nh the president then went on by 
helicopter to kennebunkport his oceanside vacation home where he 
was to spend the weekend 
souter at one point came back to the press section of air force 
one and joked with reporters i dont want to ruin my reputation 
i have two words to say hi and goodbye 
bush speaking with reporters on the plane said he thought 
reaction to his fivedayold nomination was very favorable so 
far 
its hard to tell about the senate a lot have not expressed 
their views but nationally im very pleased there seems to be 
welldeserved support for judge souter so well see 
asked if he anticipated any problems winning senate approval of 
his nomination bush said i dont really think so ive been 
very pleased with the initial response and then the second wave is 
very positive because the more people who know him speak up there 
seems to be broad support 
bush conceded that souter was not very well known but he said 
thats not why i selected him hell be plenty well known when he 
gets testifying and gets through this process which i think hell 
do with flying colors 
bush said he had not seen an interview on abctv thursday night 
in which supreme court justice thurgood marshall suggested he had 
been manipulated by white house chief of staff john sununu in 
selecting souter 
however indicating he was aware of the marshall comments bush 
said i have great respect for the supreme court i have no 
comment at all on it none i have a very high regard for the 
separation of powers and for the supreme court i think people can 
get along without a comment from me on this interview 
bush was asked about comments by rudman suggesting that souter 
had been reluctant to come to washington if it meant he had to face 
probing questions from the white house on his views on possible 
decisions 
asked if he had made a deal in advance not to ask souter such 
questions bush said no nothing on my side on that 
rudman who was also on air force one told reporters that 
souter had told him he would be uncomfortable facing difficult 
questions on possible court decisions from the president or others 
in the administration 
rudman said he intervened and called sununu and that the chief 
of staff said that it was not our policy to grill the candidate 
on possible court rulings 
rudman said he conveyed sununus assurances to souter who then 
agreed to come to washington and meet with the president 
souter brushed aside reporters questions today and said his 
confirmation hearings would be the appropriate place for me to 
respond 
whether the white house asked souter for his views on specific 
issues in particular the thorny abortion question had been the 
subject of intense scrutiny since bush announced the nomination 
monday 
on sunday night after the white house invited souter to 
washington for an interview souter talked with rudman his 
longtime friend by telephone a short time later souter placed a 
second call to rudman who gave this account of it today 
we hung up and not five minutes later david called back and 
said ive been thinking about this and i want to find out i have 
no reason to believe anyone is going to ask me specific questions 
about how i would rule but i dont want to be put in that 
position 
there are major issues pending before the court and if they 
want to discuss things with specificity its better for me not 
to go 
souter finished up an initial round of meetings with judiciary 
committee members today and reporters asked him if he set a 
precondition that the white house not ask him about roe v wade 
the landmark decision legalizing abortion 
i think with respect that that is certainly a question that 
im going to be asked when the time for the confirmation hearing 
comes and i think that would be the appropriate place for me to 
respond souter said 
pressed again he said im going to leave any response on 
that publicly for the confirmation hearings 
in announcing souters nomination on monday bush said it 
would have been inappropriate to ask him his views on specific 
issues and he did not do so

supreme court justice thurgood marshall says 
he is mystified by president bushs choice to succeed retired 
justice william j brennan a man marshall says cannot be 
replaced 
in a rare public interview marshall also suggested the 
appointment of david h souter to the high court may have been a 
political move dictated by conservative white house chief of staff 
john sununu 
asked today if he was offended by marshalls remarks souter 
responded i wouldnt care to say 
in an interview broadcast thursday on abcs primetime live 
marshall also said he would vote against bush if he came up for 
election but felt constrained not to say too much bad about the 
president 
its said that if you cant say something good about a dead 
person dont say it marshall said of bush well i consider 
him dead 
bush said today he had not seen the interview however 
indicating he was aware of marshalls comments bush said i have 
great respect for the supreme court i have no comment at all on 
it nonei have a very high regard for the separation of powers 
and for the supreme court i think people can get along without a 
comment from me on this interview 
marshall 82 a staunch liberal ally of brennan on the high 
court has been outspoken in the past about another republican 
president ronald reagan 
in a televised interview in 1987 marshall said reagans civil 
rights record ranks at the bottom among us presidents 
in the interview conducted wednesday in marshalls office in the 
supreme court building the justice said he expects to be voting in 
the minority a lot more because of brennans departure 
theres nobody here that can persuade the way brennan can 
persuade marshall said brennan will sit down and talk to you 
and show you where youre wrong well theres nobody with that 
power on the court today i say that brennan cannot be replaced 
if youre wrong hell in the most gentle language let you 
down theres not a vicious bone in his body hes a real 
bills a gentleman marshall said 
he said the souter appointment might be the work of sununu who 
as governor of new hampshire put souter on that states supreme 
court 
marshall said when souters appointment was announced on 
television he turned to his wife and said have i ever heard of 
this man 
he said he then called brennans home to find out whether he 
knew souter marshall said brennans wife answered the phone and 
said brennan never heard of him either 
asked by interviewer sam donaldson why he thought bush picked 
souter marshall replied i dont have the slightest idea never 
heard of him i just dont understand what he bush is doing 
this last appointment is the epitome of what hes been doing i 
think somebodys calling his shots 
souter asked by a reporter whether he had heard of marshall 
said i certainly have heard i trust there is no one in the 
united states who has not heard of justice marshall 
asked about his feelings toward bush marshall said if he 
came up for election id vote against him 
asked if he believes bush is running for reelection the 
justice said i dont think hes ever stopped 
he added that he is not discouraged by brennans retirement 
its not going to slow me down at all he said i asked 
each one of my law clerks that i hired for this year do you 
mind writing dissenting opinions 
brennan announced his retirement july 20 and bush picked souter 
to replace him three days later before then souter was largely 
unknown outside of new hampshire 
marshall also repeated what he has said many times before that 
he was appointed to a life term on the court and means to serve it 
but he said i have a deal with my wife that when i begin to 
show any signs of senility shell tell me and she will 
marshall also said one of the differences between him and 
brennan is that he tells jokes he doesnt tell dirty ones like i 
tell

oer the ramparts rained criticism of roseanne 
barrs screeching offkey rendition of the national anthem at a 
baseball game but the comedian defended her conduct even if her 
wailing solo struck out 
geez gimme a break i was just trying to sing a song the 
caustic star of the abc sitcom roseanne told los angelesarea 
television station kcal in a telephone interview broadcast thursday 
night 
barr conceded she was no beverly sills referring to the 
famed opera singer she said she has a naturally shrill singing 
voice 
i apologize that people were so appalled she said 
but she added if this is the worst thing they ever heard 
theyve had it really easy barr said if she ever sang the anthem 
again shed want to do it for a hipper crowd 
president bush flying to kennebunkport maine for the weekend 
said today that barrs rendition was disgraceful thats the way 
i feel about it and i think a lot of san diego fans said the same 
thing 
fans at jack murphy stadium where the san diego padres were 
playing a doubleheader with the cincinnati reds booed barr after 
the shrieking performance wednesday 
after screaming the final notes she grabbed her crotch and spit 
on the field 
barr told kcal the crotchgrabbing gesture and spitting were 
meant to parody mannerisms common among some baseball players not 
to show disrepect for the anthem or booing fans 
the comedy actress had been invited to sing the starspangled 
banner by her boss tom werner the cocreator and executive 
producer of roseanne earlier this year werner led a 15member 
investment group that bought the padres for 75 million he is now 
chairman and managing partner of the team 
padres headquarters were deluged by 1200 calls thursday mostly 
complaints the team issued an apology and said in the statement 
that they recognize their obligation to ensure the national 
anthem is sung with respect and dignity 
national league president william d white said we have 
discussed it with the padres and are in agreement with their 
apology we are satisfied that they will take all necessary steps 
to assure it will not happen again 
on thursday night before their game against the houston astros 
the padres played a taped version of the national anthem performed 
by the marine corps the crowd gave it a rousing ovation 
barrs caterwauling rendition was the subject of much of johnny 
carsons tonight show monologue thursday night 
francis scott key must be spinning like a lathe he quipped 
referring to the anthems composer the closest sound i heard was 
when i got my cat neutered 
others leveled more serious criticism 
it was to me like burning of the flag said robert merrill 
70 who has been singing the national anthem in new yorks yankee 
stadium for 18 years 
padres pitcher eric show said its an insult there are 
people who died for that song 
about 30000 people attended the doubleheader promoted as 
working womens night 
i was embarrassed for the women who showed up said 
spectator jannette davis of san diego this was supposed to be a 
night of saluting those who worked hard and she made us all feel 
like crap 
it wasnt the first time barr achieved notoriety at a baseball 
game in the stands during a world series game in oakland last 
fall she bared her bottom revealing a tattoo declaring tom 
her husband tom arnold 
on thursday arnold urged critics to lighten up 
they knew what kind of singer she is shes just an average 
singer shes not an opera singer arnold told the associated 
press by telephone from their malibu home she did the best she 
could 
barr wouldnt come to the telephone but was troubled by the 
criticism he said 
shes very sorry arnold said shes very upset that 
people think she meant disrespect

bakhtiar escaped injury and still lives in paris where the 
attack occurred but a policeman and a bystander were killed and 
three people were wounded including a policeman who remains 
paralyzed 
both defense and prosecution said at the trial that naccache and 
his team were acting on orders from senior iranian officials 
the justice ministry announced the releases in a twosentence 
communique which said the five have benefited from an act of 
clemency after having spent 10 years in prison they have been 
issued an order of expulsion from french territory which was 
carried out today 
naccache was one of three prisoners whose freedom was demanded 
by a group calling itself the committee for solidarity with arab 
and middle east prisoners which claimed responsibility for 
bombings in 198586 that killed 13 people and injured more than 250 
in paris 
ten people involved in that bombing campaign received prison 
sentences of varying lengths at a trial earlier this year 
naccache and highranking iranian officials contended that his 
release was part of a 1988 deal that won freedom for all french 
hostages then held in lebanon 
jacques chirac frances prime minister at the time denied that 
naccaches freedom was part of the package which included 
resolutions of bilateral financial disputes 
renewed appeals for naccaches freedom came in april after the 
release in beirut of frenchwoman jacqueline valente her belgian 
boyfriend fernand houtekins and their daughter sophieliberte 
they were freed april 10 by members of the fatahrevolutionary 
council a radical palestinian group led by abu nidal the group is 
backed by libya 
naccache born in 1951 was an architect in beirut and 
reportedly was a friend of ahmad khomenei son of iranian 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomenei 
those freed along with him were mehdi nejad tabrizzi and mohamed 
jawat jeneb both iranians fauozi mohamed el satari a 
palestinian and salaheddine el kaara a lebanese

military force will be used to restore peace in 
armenia and other republics if armed groups disobey a new 
government order to surrender their weapons soviet interior 
minister vadim a bakatin warned friday 
president mikhail s gorbachev issued a decree wednesday giving 
illegally armed militants 15 days to turn in their weapons or risk 
having them confiscated by local police officials of the republics 
or interior ministry troops 
if we do not take such measures we will not be able to 
control such processes as those under way at present for example 
in armenia bakatin told a news conference 
if any guerrillas do not comply with the decree we have been 
entrusted to use force bakatin said we hope that reason will 
prevail 
he estimated from 10000 to 20000 armenians were involved in 
illegally armed groups but said others put the figure at 40000 
and as high as 100000 
gorbachevs decree encompassed all groups which threatened 
peoples lives seized arms assaulted soldiers or police or 
attacked military and civilian facilities 
the decree was gorbachevs latest attempt to reassert central 
authority over an increasing fractious country on friday the 
byelorussian republic declared that its law takes precedent over 
soviet law following similar stands by russia the ukraine and the 
baltic republics 
besides armenia bakatin said illegally armed groups also 
operate in moldavia georgia azerbaijan latvia lithuania and 
estonia 
bakatin said interior ministry troops would be sent to republics 
requesting them and army troops could go in if a state of 
emergency were declared 
he said many local officials are swept up in the same 
nationalism as their neighbors and are powerless to stop ethnic 
fighting 
if we call a spade a spade the conflicts mean pure sheer 
nationalism he said 
local authorities are unfortunately local authorities nothing 
more they do not differ in any respect from the people who 
surround them and who have contracted the same disease which is 
nationalism 
in conflicts between ethnic groups we simply have to rely on 
our units of the ministry of the interior bakatin said 
ethnic violence has killed more than 200 people along the border 
between western kirghizia and uzbekistan in central asia in recent 
weeks 
interior ministry soldiers already patrol the border between 
azerbaijan and armenia at least 200 more have been killed and 
many thousands have been forced to flee their homes in violence 
between armenians and azerbaijanis in the past two years 
in armenia troops have seized 6000 firearms including 1500 
automatic weapons bakatin said 
he acknowledged there could be problems implementing gorbachevs 
decree if moscow does not have the full cooperation of the 
republics the armenian parliament has set up a commission to study 
the order and the interfax news agency said many lawmakers sharply 
opposed it 
interfax reported some lawmakers wanted to form an independent 
armenian army during the 15 days or that the decree be first 
approved by the republics parliament 
if we cooperate with the republics there will be no 
problems bakatin said but if our actions contradict one 
another then serious difficulties and collisions would occur and 
these collisions would be of a political character 
the decree comes at a time when gorbachev is trying to negotiate 
a treaty with all 15 soviet republics to transfer some powers from 
the central government to local authorities who want more autonomy 
from moscow 
but gorbachevs press spokesman arkady maslennikov said there 
was no connection between the two events 
this is a clear call on those republics to restore law and 
order he said in a number of locations certain criminal 
groups are being set up illegal groups operating under separatist 
slogans and that is in conflict with the stable development of 
the country 
bakatin said the soviet unions crime rate has eased to 146 
percent this year from 20 percent last year crimes involving 
firearms increased however from 4688 in 1985 to 5400 last year 
and 3433 in the first six months of this year 
drug abuse is also on the upswing with 220000 known drug 
abusers he said

wells theater blamed the problem on excessive air travel during 
his years of performing all over the world

sometimes people talk nonsense so it lets me hear what i want to 
hear marceau said

east germanys government averted collapse 
friday after its secondbiggest faction agreed to remain in the 
coalition that will dissolve the country in december 
the social democrats had threatened to resign from the coalition 
government of prime minister lothar de maiziere unless a dispute 
over united german elections was reached 
they agreed to remain in the government after de maiziere 
appeared to back away from a demand that east germany remain a 
separate country until after united german elections are held on 
dec 2 
under that plan the german states would hold separate elections 
for the same parliament and then formally unify 
the social democrats had demanded that east germany dissolve 
itself dec 1 and merge with west germany so a single allgerman 
election could be held the following day 
the seemingly trivial dispute over whether east germany should 
dissolve dec 1 or dec 2 and whether the two germanys should 
vote as one country or two could help determine which political 
factions get seats in parliament 
de maiziere and other christian democratic leaders had said 
earlier that single elections could be held after unification takes 
place the social democrats on friday trumpeted their success on 
the issue 
but de maiziere appeared to qualify that again in an interview 
to be published saturday in the west german newspaper die welt 
de maiziere said unification could be formally voted on by east 
germanys 400member parliament before elections but actually take 
place afterward 
in the interview released in advance of publication de 
maiziere also said single german elections are not possible 
his comments were yet another twist in the political wrangling 
that has consumed parties in both german states for the past week 
and a half 
the complicated argument represents maneuvering by parties 
seeking the most favorable election conditions 
the small liberal party allied with the leftleaning social 
democrats on the issue resigned from de maizieres sevenparty 
governing coalition tuesday over the dispute 
but the decision by the social democrats to remain in de 
maizieres coalition averted a crisis that threatened to seriously 
complicate the process of unification 
because the social democrats remained de maizieres government 
still controls the twothirds parliament majority needed to unify 
with west germany 
a christian democrat deputy party chief horst korbella said 
the social democrats decision to remain the government has made 
a breakthrough possible 
de maizieres conservative christian democrats had advocated 
separate elections so smaller east german parties could have a 
better chance of winning seats in a unified parliament 
de maiziere has said special accommodations should be made to 
ensure that smaller east german parties have a voice in a big new 
allgerman parliament 
but a lower limit on representation also would help the 
archconservative german social union a key political ally of de 
maizieres christian democrats 
the social democrats believe the lower election representation 
limit would hurt them by allowing smaller leftist groups to get in 
parliament and splinter their constituency 
de maiziere is still pressing to lower the minimum percentage of 
votes a party needs to get in parliament 
under west german law parties need 5 percent of the total 
german vote to be represented in parliament no minimum is required 
in east germany 
the social democrats are seeking to retain the 5 percent limit 
which is called for in the west german constitution that will be 
the law of a united german land 
the sides have been discussing compromises including requiring 
that parties get only 5 percent in their respective nations or 5 
percent in each of the 16 total states of both nations

thawing superpower relations 
and a tight budget have clipped the wings of the nations flying 
nuclear command which is no longer in the air around the clock 
officials said friday 
the looking glass mission which had flown continuously for 
29 years was scaled back tuesday in a budgetcutting move that 
recognizes improved superpower relations the strategic air command 
announced friday 
the missions ec135 aircraft are on ground alert and will be 
flown randomly a few times a week 
in this time of budget crunch it was the right thing to do 
said lt col george peck a sac spokesman 
the world situation is such that keeping continuously airborne 
is perhaps not as critical as in the past 
sac expects the change to save about 18 million in the 1991 
fiscal year and about 23 million the following year said peck 
most of the savings will come from reduced fuel and maintenance 
the mission is dubbed looking glass because it mirrors the 
capability of sacs underground command center it would perform 
the command and control functions if something happened to the sac 
headquarters at offutt air force base near omaha 
sac maintains the capability to launch the looking glass into 
a continuous airborne alert posture within minutes should strategic 
or tactical warning warrant the command said in a statement 
flights include a crew of 31 three who operate the plane and 28 
who work in the airborne command center including an air force 
general peck said the planes fly a changing flight pattern over 
the continental united states 
the number of crews wont be cut he said 
improved us intelligence capabilities and the resulting 
increased warning time of any attack also contributed to the 
cutback he said

the government rewrote a slice of economic 
history on friday reporting that the total economy grew at a 
slower pace last year than previously thought 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
nations broadest measure of economic health grew by 25 percent 
in 1989 instead of the 3 percent growth rate estimated earlier 
that put growth at its slowest pace since the recession year of 
1982 when the gnp actually shrank by 25 percent 
government statisticians blamed the error on mistakes made in 
estimating wages and salaries which were overstated by 579 
billion for 1989 
the correction changed not only the governments economic 
estimates but also its forecast for tax revenues over the next 
several years the office of management and budget was forced to 
slash its estimate for tax revenues by 1955 billion over the next 
five years 
the drop in expected tax revenues along with the weaker economic 
growth were two major factors forcing president bush to reverse his 
stand on taxes as part of negotiations with congress to come up 
with an acceptable deficit reduction plan 
while the commerce departments initial assessment of wages is 
based on a partial sample of businesses the july update takes into 
account more complete data gathered from the countrys roughly 6 
million businesses 
the annual economic revisions also made somewhat smaller changes 
for growth in 1988 and 1987 gnp growth for 1988 was put at 45 
percent up slightly from an earlier 44 percent estimate growth 
for 1987 was revised down to 34 percent from 37 percent 
the department also revised its estimates for quarterly economic 
growth over the past three years for 1989 gnp growth rates were 
revised down for every quarter with the biggest change occurring in 
the fourth quarter which saw growth drop from 11 percent to a 
barely noticeable 03 percent

to fidel castro the spectacle of cubans fleeing 
his revolution is less a problem than an opportunity to score 
points against capitalist foes 
as is his custom castro went on the offensive thursday night 
daring the united states spain and other proponents of human 
rights to take in all cubans who are fed up with his revolution 
the only cubans exempted from this offer he said are the 40 or 
so who have barged into foreign embassies over the past 18 days to 
ask for political asylum 
it is inconsistent for western governments he said to offer 
refuge to unhappy cubans at their embassies on the one hand while 
not welcoming cubans who wish to emigrate through more conventional 
procedures 
in washington the bush administration sharply rejected castros 
sarcastic call for us ships to come and pick up cubans unhappy 
with his rule 
one of the darkest moments of castros 31year rule occurred 10 
years ago when 125000 cubans fled to florida aboard ships with 
little more than the shirts on their backs the exodus began when 
cubans by the thousands began seeking asylum at the peruvian 
embassy 
there was a sense of deja vu this month when cubans eager to 
leave began arriving at the czech embassy others sought refuge at 
embassies elsewhere in the capital 
could this be castros waterloo after all the communist regime 
in east germany began to unravel last year after hungary allowed 
east germans to escape to the west through its country within 
months democratic movements were sweeping communist governments 
from power throughout eastern europe 
castro easily survived the exodus a decade ago but now he is 
faced with political and ideological isolation and an economy worse 
off in many ways than it was in 1980 
when encountering difficulty castro is not one to pout he 
demonstrated that trait thursday night when he spoke to hundreds of 
thousands of his countrymen on the 37th anniversary of the start of 
his revolutionary movement 
he was especially tough on spain whose embassy has sheltered 18 
uninvited asylumseekers over the past week four others are at the 
italian ambassadors residence 
his voice rising in indignation castro chastized spain for 
sheltering cubans who were not targets of law enforcement 
authorities 
the spaniards he said are even giving refuge to a cuban who 
fought his way in with a machete 
he expressed outrage with spains decision last week to suspend 
a 25 million aid program for cuba he said the move puts spain in 
the same league as cubas no 1 enemy the united states 
for arrogance for pride who knows why they the spaniards 
have made themselves accomplices in the imperialist aggression 
against cuba he said 
castro did not spare president bush either suggesting that bush 
is obsessed with bringing down communism in cuba 
he cited the recent testimony of a cuban dissident who said 
that as far back as march the us diplomatic mission had been 
encouraging cubans to seek asylum at foreign embassies 
beyond that he said the united states has not fulfilled the 
1984 bilateral agreement on immigration thus indirectly forcing 
cubans who want to escape to utilize drastic means 
he also said bush was lobbying the soviet union to suspend aid 
to cuba and had threatened the island with military exercises in 
nearby waters 
when bush goes to eat breakfast he finds cuba in his coffee 
in the water in the bread castro said neither asleep nor 
awake does he forget about cuba it is a sick obsession and a shame 
for the world 
the us diplomatic mission here says the united states has 
lived up to the 1984 immigration agreement and never incited cubans 
to seek refuge at foreign embassies 
the spanish government said friday it had no interest in further 
conflict with cuba and did not encourage aslyumseekers 
accusatory or highflown phrases dont help very much to 
produce the dialogue needed to resolve the problem said the 
foreign ministry undersecretary inocencio arias

a department of health and human services 
advisory panel friday recommended removing social security from the 
calculation of deficit reduction targets to focus public attention 
on the ballooning deficit 
the advisory council on social security also recommended 
continuing the payroll tax rate at the current level to build 
reserves as a cushion for the retirement of 75 million baby 
boomers which will begin around 2010 
the council said in its interim report that maintaining a strong 
social security system depends on having a healthy growing economy 
and that large deficits in the federal budget weaken the economy 
the council believes that the growing social security reserves 
should not routinely be used simply to offset large operating 
deficits in the rest of the federal budget the panel said 
the panels report said the financial soundness of the social 
security trust funds is not affected by whether the trust funds are 
included or excluded in calculating deficit reduction targets 
but taking social security out of the grammrudmanhollings 
calculations will help federal policymakers and the american 
people focus on the fundamental importance of reducing the deficit 
and moving toward a surplus in the overall federal budget the 
council said 
the council also opposed changing the social security programs 
financing to a payasyougo system in which payroll taxes 
would be set at a rate sufficient to raise enough revenues to cover 
current expenses and maintain a contingency reserve 
under the current system social security taxes raise more than 
is needed for current payments to build up reserves for use in 
future years 
these trillions of dollars in baby boomers future retirement 
benefits stirred heated debate earlier this year when sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny proposed cutting the social security 
payroll tax 
under moynihans plan the tax would begin going up again in the 
year 2015 he said that would give the country 25 years of lower 
taxes to help the economy grow and allow it to afford the higher 
taxes later 
the white house opposed the idea and the plan is stalled in 
congress 
the council also recommended continuing the current policy of 
investing social security trust fund reserves in interestbearing 
treasury securities guaranteed by the government 
about 39 million americans receive social security benefits 
most of them retired workers 
the payroll tax rate paid by workers and employers is 62 
percent each on earnings up to 51300 selfemployed workers pay 
both the employer and employee share of the tax

israel could respond with its own chemical 
weapons if iraq attacked it with such arms science minister yuval 
neeman said friday in an escalation of middle east war rhetoric 
defense ministry spokesman danny naveh refused to comment on 
neemans remarks the most farreaching by an israeli leader on the 
subject israel is widely believed to have chemical weapons but 
officials have never admitted it 
neemans warning was the latest volley in a war of words started 
by iraqi president saddam hussein who in april threatened to burn 
half of israel if israel attacked iraq 
in june 1981 israel bombed an iraqi nuclear reactor near 
baghdad claiming it was being used to develop nuclear weapons 
iraq denied this 
last week saddam threatened hostilities with neighboring kuwait 
and the united arab emirates if they did not cut oil production 
in the past week israeli officials have sharpened their 
rhetoric in response to saddam with defense minister moshe arens 
saying iraqs threats have increased the likelihood of war 
some israeli newspaper editorials and analysts said arens and 
others apparently were trying to rally us support at a time when 
the us congress is debating wideranging cuts in military 
spending that could affect israel 
neeman a member of the ultrarightist tehiya party said in an 
interview with israel radio friday that israel was ready to counter 
iraqi threats 
in my opinion we have an excellent response and that is to 
threaten saddam hussein with the same merchandise said neeman 
who also is head of israels space program 
neeman said any advanced nation has the capability to 
manufacture chemical weapons and if there is an enemy like this 
it is possible to prepare a suitable response he said 
reached by telephone after the radio broadcast neeman did not 
deny he meant israel had chemical weapons when asked directly if 
the country possessed such arms he replied thata a question 
for the minister of defense 
prime minister yitzhak shamir apparently was displeased by 
neemans remarks a source in shamirs office said the prime 
minister would meet with neeman to discuss the radio interview 
neeman 65 has served in the past both as deputy director of 
army intelligence and scientific director of israels atomic energy 
program 
another threat against iraq came from eliyahu ben elissar head 
of parliaments defense and foreign affairs committee who said in 
a speech thursday night that israel would retaliate harshly if 
attacked by iraq 
editorials in two leftleaning papers alhamishmar and davar 
said arens remarks on iraq increasing the likelihood of war were 
mostly aimed at gaining more money for israels defense 
military analyst aharon levran said that talk of war was 
exaggerated and aimed in part at securing continued us funding 
for the arrow antimissile system that israel is developing 
levran a retired brigidier general argued that with egypt and 
syria unlikely to attack israel iraq would have a hard time waging 
war because it doesnt share a border with the jewish state 
at worst there might be an exchange of air blows but i dont 
see a continued and intensive war erupting because of the 
distance

have been pulled from a popular swimming hole which police also 
found to be a popular repository for cardunking 
most of the cars were dumped by owners who then falsely reported 
the vehicles stolen to collect insurance money officers said 
thursday 
others primarily the very new ones were dumped when people got 
behind in payments and wanted to collect on the insurance police 
said 
cardunking a form of insurance fraud is to blame for most 
of the cars being submerged in the cool green pond that is 
surrounded by sunflowers and tall grass authorities said 
all of the vehicles had been reported stolen in plano 
arlington dallas and sherman but none showed evidence of auto 
theft when wreckers dragged them from the pond according to plano 
detective gregg gibbs 
anna is located between dallas and sherman in north texas 
we were finding that they were unstripped with keys in the 
ignition and boards and bricks holding the accelerators down 
gibbs said 
it is estimated that 46 percent of all auto thefts reported in 
the united states are actually insurance fraud he said 
collin county sheriffs investigator jim broyles said officers 
became suspicious when swimmers reported seeing oil slicks on the 
water 
broyles and other divers then went into the water and discovered 
the underwater parking lot many of the cars were piled on top of 
other cars broyles said 
it was like swimming through a wrecking yard broyles said 
charley evans division manager of the national auto theft 
bureau in dallas said cardunking scams are common nationwide 
many ponds across the country are probably filled with cars he 
said 
but evans said he has never heard of so many cars being found in 
one place before

upset to comment to the press before his departure 
kozlovs hijacking of a flight from riga latvia on june 19 was 
one of five such incidents in june and early july during that 
time three soviet flights were commandeered to sweden and two to 
finland 
soviet authorities have requested that all the hijackers be 
extradited 
one hijacker remains in custody in finland sweden extradited 
one hijacker and still holds two others 
swedish lawyers ukrainian deputies and others have appealed to 
the swedish authorities to sentence the youths in sweden they say

could face up to 15 years in prison under atrocious conditions 
but swedens supreme court ruled earlier this week there were no 
legal obstacles to the extraditions

federal aids experts said friday they likely will 
never know for sure whether a dentist transmitted aids to a 
patient but were obligated to warn the public about the 
possibility 
a report thursday from the us centers for disease control that 
a young woman apparently was infected by her dentist while having 
two molars pulled made headlines across the country and drew 
criticism from the american dental association dental association 
officials said the agency may have jumped to conclusions 
dr harold jaffe deputy director for science at the cdcs 
hivaids program said friday theres no way researchers will ever 
prove that the woman was infected during the dental procedure 
although all available evidence points to that conclusion 
we dont really expect we will get more information jaffe 
said 
the cdcs weekly report which carried details of the case 
routinely informs physicians and public health officials about 
noteworthy developments in infectious disease it is not unusual 
for the report to note as this weeks report did that the 
source of a specific illness cannot be proven with 100 percent 
certainty 
but dr enid neidle director of scientific affairs for the 
chicagobased ada said the association thought it was not a 
conclusive case of transmission 
we are not happy at any report that could raise fears on the 
part of the public that the dental office is a place of danger and 
infection neidle said 
responding to the adas criticism jaffe said i dont think 
wed be serving the public interest to not publish this case 
the agency said a lengthy investigation of the womans case 
found no other risk factors for aids such as intravenous drug 
abuse or numerous sexual encounters two men she had dated each 
tested negative for hiv the aids virus and dnavirus testing 
showed a likely match between her strain of hiv and the dentists 
but researchers are not exactly sure how the woman actually 
became infected 
jaffe said not much more will ever be known about the case the 
womans trip to the dentist occurred more than two years ago 
records in the case are somewhat sketchy and theres a limited 
amount to be gleaned from questioning the doctor he said 
everyones frustration here revolves around the lack of 
information about the specific exposure he said 
the dentist was wearing a mask and gloves while pulling the 
womans teeth as recommended the case has prompted the cdc to 
review its guidelines for transmission of aids in medical settings 
the guidelines say that to prevent the spread of diseases such 
as aids and hepatitis bodily fluids from any patient must be 
considered potentially infectious health care workers are urged to 
wear appropriate protection whenever skin or mucousmembrane 
exposure to bodily fluids is likely including gloves face masks 
protective goggles and surgical gowns 
federal experts will meet aug 13 with representatives from the 
dentral association other medical societies workers groups and 
other interested parties to discuss the case 
we have no doubt that if the cdc decides that some aspects of 
the precautionary procedures should be changed and there is a 
consensus the ada will obviously take under very serious 
consideration the recommendations that emerge neidle said 
but its difficult to imagine how one could get more elaborate 
than the current precautions are 
since the cdc report was made public many dentists have called 
the dental association for more information about the federal 
report said phil weintraub the organizations manager of media 
relations 
theyre very concerned about how the public is going to take 
this information he said

fortytwo men convicted in a bloody coup 
attempt were executed by firing squad friday night immediately 
after appeals of their death sentences were rejected the 
government announced 
the echoes of rifle fire were heard outside kirikiri prison 
where the condemned men were held many prominent nigerians and 
international organizations including amnesty international had 
urged president gen ibrahim babangida to spare their lives 
they were charged with attacking dodon barracks the military 
headquarters and residence of babangida on april 22 in an attempt 
to overthrow him babangida barely escaped with his life and his 
house was badly damaged 
the coup leaders who took over national radio headquarters for 
several hours said they wanted to end the domination of the 
country by moslem northerners 
the men were convicted following a military tribunal this month 
that was closed to the public and they were sentenced to death 
the armed forces ruling council rejected appeals of the death 
sentences and the executions were carried out the radio reported 
the council ordered retrials for 31 other people convicted by a 
military tribunal 
the council met thursday and friday making its ruling late 
friday afternoon there was little doubt the coup ringleaders 
including maj gideon orkar would be shot wooden stakes had been 
set up at the prison where the men were held 
hundreds of people including some civilians were arrested 
after the coup attempt the government said the civilian financer 
of the coup millionaire businessman chief great ovedje ogboru and 
some officers believed involved in it had escaped 
adm augustus aikhomu the no 2 man in the military government 
read a statement on television and radio friday evening saying 764 
people had been acquitted of all charges 
no casualty figures were ever released from the attempted 
overthrow but army spokesman col fred chijuka said it was the 
bloodiest attempt ever against the government 
dozens of people died in coups in 1966 which triggered ethnic 
violence that ultimately sparked the biafran war the 19671970 war 
was an effort by easterners to secede from the federation the 
easterners mostly christian or followers of traditional african 
religions alleged moslem northerners dominated the nation 
the rebels after capturing the national radio station in april 
made a similar claim they also said babangidas execution of lt 
gen mamman vatsa in 1986 for allegedly plotting a coup was a 
reason for seeking his overthrow 
ethnic tensions were fanned in january when babangida removed 
lt gen domkat bali from his post as defense minister effectively 
demoting the most important nonnortherner in the government 
though bali said he remained loyal to the president there were 
widespread protests of his reassignment and the general retired 
the government sought to portray the coup attempt as a bid by 
greedy soldiers to gain wealth it said coup backers offered 1428 
to enlisted men and 7142 for officers 
fighting began at 2 am with an attack on dodan barracks 
babangida fled and directed a counterattack fighting continued for 
10 hours and was only quelled after senior commanders in other 
regions of the country went on the radio to announce their support 
for babangida

a 2yearold agreement regulating allterrain 
vehicles fails to protect children from death and serious injury 
said congressmen state legislators and consumer advocates on 
friday 
atvs are kidkillers plain and simple said charles j 
chvala a wisconsin state senator urging further federal action to 
ban atv use by children under 16 
even adult riders face risks due to the lack of adequate safety 
standards for the stability of the offroad vehicles witnesses 
told the senate governmental affairs committee 
your age doesnt mean youre going to be safe said rep 
bill sarpalius describing how he suffered a broken back when an 
atv he was riding rolled over the texas democrat called for an 
outright ban on sales of atvs in the united states 
government figures show about 300 people are killed annually in 
atvrelated incidents and 50000 people are injured the government 
estimates there will be 200 such deaths and 39000 injuries in 1992 
but industry representatives argued that a 1988 consent decree 
signed with the consumer product safety commission provides for an 
unprecedented 8 million consumer information program and has 
resulted in a reduction of injuries 
the agreement between the cpsc and five manufacturers of atvs in 
the united states honda yamaha suzuki polaris and kawasaki 
banned sales of new threewheel atvs restricted marketing of 
larger fourwheelers to adults and required age restriction 
labeling on vehicles and notices in dealerships 
it is virtually impossible for a consumer to visit an atv 
dealership and not be made aware of appropriate age recommendations 
and safe use information said howard p willens an attorney 
representing atv makers 
cpsc chairwoman jacqueline jonessmith defended the accord 
saying it struck a balance between allowing consumers the freedom 
to purchase adultsized atvs while at the same time providing 
consumers with protection against the risks associated with atvs 
however recent government and consumer studies have shown 
dealers routinely violate the agreement 
i do not mean to belittle the efforts of the cpsc said sen 
joseph lieberman dconn a member of governmental affairs panel 
nevertheless the number of deaths and injuries from atvs remains 
unacceptably high and children under 16 still account for nearly 
40 percent of those hurt or killed 
anne graham a commissioner who has opposed most cpsc decisions 
regarding atvs said the government must do more to get children 
off adultsized atvs including considering a ban 
these machines are not bought by children said willens 
arguing that federal or state action to ban the atvs would be 
improper 
willens insisted that a subsequent letter of agreement with the 
cpsc regarding monitoring and dealer discipline would ensure 
greater compliance 
two consumer groups the consumer federation of america and us 
public interest research group said it had submitted a petition to 
the cpsc that would close gaps in the current accord 
the organizations recommended the agency institute a permanent 
ban on threewheel atvs a ban on atv sales to children a 
mandatory requirement for atv lateral stability and a refund 
program to consumers for atvs purchased for children 
willens said manufacturers would resist any refund program

nelson mandela insisted friday 
there was no communist plot within the african national congress to 
seize power but the national police chief said arrests of anc 
guerrillas probably would continue 
police gen johan van der merwe said the detention of a number 
of senior anc and south african communist party militants in recent 
days had turned up considerable evidence of a conspiracy in an 
interview with the staterun south african broadcasting corp van 
der merwe said more arrests were likely but gave no details 
president fw de klerk met with mandela for more than two hours 
thursday night news reports said de klerk showed him police 
evidence of an alleged plan by communist members of the anc to 
stage a revolt if negotiations with the government break down 
there is no plot as far as were concerned mandela said 
friday morning 
the ancs national executive committee which includes several 
leaders of the south african communist party is to meet over the 
next three days to discuss the government allegations and mandela 
said he and de klerk would meet again aug 1 
anc spokesman pallo jordan said de klerk told mandela the 
government would prefer that communist party leader joe slovo not 
be part of the anc delegation in talks with the government on aug 
6 
the talks are aimed at removing barriers to fullscale 
negotiations on ending whiteminority rule the anc is insisting 
among other things that the government release all political 
prisoners and lift the remaining state of emergency the government 
wants the anc to agree to a ceasefire 
the anc has been allied with the south african communist party 
for more than four decades slovo is a member of the ancs 
executive committee and a former chief of the anc military wing 
de klerks office said the president had invited mandela to the 
meeting in pretoria because it appears the anc does not 
appreciate the seriousness of the facts which were brought to light 
by the south african police investigations of the past few days 
a police statement said about 40 militants had been arrested 
recently because of information about an alleged conspiracy by 
the communist party and the ancs military wing to overthrow the 
government by force if negotiations with the government failed 
several newspapers reported that de klerk had shown mandela a 
police dossier allegedly based on seized records of a communist 
party meeting the police reportedly said slovo announced that the 
party would not be bound by any ceasefire between the anc and the 
government the reports said slovo made the remark two weeks after 
signing an agreement in may with the government and the anc to work 
to end violence 
south african newspapers quoting unidentified government 
sources have said the ancs top leadership and the commanders of 
the anc military wing did not know about the alleged plot

radioactive gas was released from a nuclear 
reactor early friday shortly after the unit at a power plant was 
shut down philadelphia electric co announced 
the 10minute release from unit 3 was well below limits for the 
plant and didnt endanger the public or workers at the peach 
bottom plant near the pennsylvaniamaryland line about 40 miles 
west of philadelphia officials said 
philadelphia electric declared an unusual event at the plant 
the lowest of four classifications of nuclear power plant 
emergencies 
unit 3 had been working at full power when it was shut down at 
403 am because of low suction in the units steam condenser 
philadelphia electric said 
during the shutdown the operators declared an unusual event at 
538 am because of a momentary increase in radiation levels in an 
internal gas filtering system the unusual event ended at 6 am 
the utility said no radiation was released up to then 
the gas release happened after the shutdown as plant operators 
were trying to restore suction in the steam condenser philadelphia 
electric said 
the release consisted primarily of inert gases such as xenon and 
krypton which dont react with other chemicals said nuclear 
regulatory commission spokesman karl abraham such gases are 
normally dispersed in the atmosphere abraham said 
the radioactivity from such a release is usually too low to 
measure he said 
unit 3 will remain shut down while workers do maintenance said 
utility spokesman neil mcdermott 
theyve been waiting for an opportunity to work on some 
systems and this is it mcdermott said none of the work is 
safetyrelated 
while the 1055megawatt reactor is shut down its twin unit 2 
is expected to continue working at 100 percent output mcdermott 
said 
the middle of summer is a time of peak demand for electricity in 
the philadelphia area mcdermott said the loss of unit 3 would 
obviously make conditions a little tighter depending on the 
weather 
abraham said nrc resident inspectors at the plant would pursue a 
routine followup on the shutdown and gas release while 
philadelphia electric carries out its own investigation 
in addition to the nrc the utility said it reported the release 
to pennsylvania maryland and york county officials

a military judge on friday convicted a us 
navy lieutenant of raping a woman officer in her stateroom aboard 
an ammunitions ship 
naval officials in spain said they could not recall a previous 
instance of a navy officer being tried or convicted for raping a 
female officer on board ship 
lt jg robin e brown of rawlins wyo remained 
expressionless as military judge us navy capt thomas a lawrence 
announced the verdict 
lawrence scheduled sentencing for saturday in the court at the 
usspanish naval station in rota in southernmost spain 
the case stemmed from an incident april 4 on the uss suribachi 
while in port in cartagena spain 
in his closing argument friday prosecutor marine capt walter 
g sharp said the evidence showed brown had entered the woman 
officers stateroom gotten into her bed and began having 
intercourse with her while she was asleep when the woman awakened 
she pushed brown away and told him to leave the room 
under the law sharp said a sleeping woman cannot give consent 
to sexual intercourse 
he pointed to the results of a medical exam of the woman just 
after the incident which showed the presence of semen 
the case has drawn attention because as the number of women in 
the navy has increased in recent years so have complaints of 
sexual harassment and discrimination 
the us military adopted an allvolunteer force in 1972 and 
since then the number of women in the navy has grown from 9000 to 
64000 
the navy said shipboard rapes are extremely rare 
the 350member crew of the suribachi includes 34 women five of 
whom are officers there are about 25 male officers serving on the 
ship according to navy spokesman lt paul weishaupt 
the defense attorney marine capt jh drescher suggested the 
woman had mistaken brown for another officer aboard the ship for 
whom she acknowledged romantic feelings he stressed the woman 
referred to brown by the other mans name as soon as she woke up

gov buddy roemer on friday vetoed what 
would have been the nations toughest state abortion law he said 
the maledominated legislature that fashioned it was insensitive to 
the rights of rape victims 
the decision by roemer who describes himself as prolife 
drew outrage from abortion opponents 
hes betrayed the prolife majority that elected him said 
nancy myers spokeswoman for the national right to life committee 
in washington 
rep woody jenkins the bills sponsor said he would ask the 
legislature to return for a special august session to hand the 
governor an override if that happened it would be the first 
override this century in louisiana 
the bill had been thrown together in the tumultous final days of 
the session which ended july 9 
during the session roemer vetoed an even tougher bill that 
would have made an exception only to save the life of the mother 
an override of that veto failed by only three votes 
in march idaho gov cecil andrus vetoed a similar bill which 
would have banned abortion except when the mothers life was 
threatened in most cases of rape or in cases of incest when the 
victim was under 18 years old 
the bill vetoed friday was passed in both legislative chambers 
with more than the twothirds majorities necessary for an override 
because the session is over however lawmakers would have to call 
themselves back for a special session by mail 
the bill would have prohibited abortions except to save the life 
of the mother and in cases of aggravated rape and incest reported 
to police and a physician no more than a week after they occurred 
had the bill become law doctors who perform abortions could be 
sentenced to 10 years in prison and 100000 fines the bill was 
designed to challenge the us supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion 
i consider myself prolife abortion on demand and as a 
substitute for birth control must be in the name of the unborn 
sharply controlled roemer told reporters 
but rape is treated unevenly and unfairly in the bill and 
its sevenday reporting period is totally unworkable and uncaring 
and unrealistic he said 
the bill allowed abortions in cases of aggravated rape in which 
the victim had been threatened with death or injury from a weapon 
it did not protect victims of simple rape defined as sexual 
intercourse when a woman is incapable of resisting such as when 
she is drunk unconscious or afraid of the rapist 
one of the things that ive tried to become sensitive to is 
the voice of women on this issue roemer said it might serve 
us well legislators and governors who tend to be predominantly 
male to take time to listen to the viewpoint of women 
only three of the 144 state legislators are women 
one of the most burdensome things about the bill that i vetoed 
today is that it did not listen at all roemer said its like 
simple rape was nonexistent it was like if a woman was mentally 
retarded she had no right and was fair game how insensitive can 
you be 
abortion rights advocates said they were heartened 
roemers response to this challenge restores the nations 
confidence in our states leadership and sends a clear and 
distinctive message that the power of the prochoice majority 
cannot be denied said joy gilmore president of the state 
chapter of the national organization for women 
but abortion foe myers said governor roemer has abandoned 
thousands of unborn children hes using phony excuses to hide 
the fact that he doesnt care at all for unborn children

canada said friday that its indian affairs 
department bought a parcel of land from a french businessman in the 
hopes of ending a 17dayold armed confrontation between quebec 
police and mohawks 
the standoff in oka 18 miles west of montreal began after 
police rushed a barricade set up by the mohawks to stop the 
expansion of the local golf course on land they claim is ancestral 
an officer was killed in the gun battle that followed no 
announcement has been made fixing responsibility in the death 
indian affairs minister tom siddon said in a statement that the 
ottawa government will buy 60 residential lots about 30 acres 
just outside oka for nearly 12 million us from maxime 
rousseau of poitiers france 
he said the government also hopes to buy the rest of the 
disputed parcel of land a total of 54 acres 
were negotiating to complete the purchase of the balance from 
the village of oka siddon said

municipal officials too often slam the door on 
companies that could provide headtohead competition for cable tv 
operators a federal regulator said friday 
federal communications commission chairman alfred sikes rejected 
the notion that like utility monopolies communities are best 
served by exclusive cable tv franchises 
competition he said will drive down both costs and prices 
but he said a new fcc study of the cable tv marketplace shows 
that cable operators face headtohead competition in only a 
handful of communities 
the result sikes told a news conference is high prices and 
poor service 
headtohead competition places an exceptionally high premium 
on cutting costs and putting the customer first sikes said 
competitive markets and competitive markets alone will in the 
final analysis forces prices toward true costs 
rather than reregulate cable prices which congress is preparing 
to do after lifting most local rate regulation in 1984 sikes said 
laws are needed to ease the way for multiplecable franchises and 
more competition from technologies such as satellite broadcasters 
and microwave cable systems 
on thursday sikes and his fellow commissioners voted 50 to 
forward a report to congress urging legislation that limits 
municipal authority to erect barriers or sustain entry barriers and 
which prohibits an unreasonable refusal to grant a second cable 
franchise 
most cable systems in the country are de facto monopolies local 
franchising authorities generally prefer to deal with one cable 
company while cable operators say it is too risky financially to 
put two cables into neighborhoods 
sikes said sidebyside cable systems could be economically 
feasible he said about 87 percent of the nations tv viewers could 
subscribe to cable but only about 60 percent do that sikes said 
shows there are many new profit centers potentially available to 
multichannel video providers millions of people in america are 
waiting for the right package of service at the right price 
the procompetitive rather than regulatory tone of the fcc 
report is in line with recent statements that bush administration 
officials have made regarding cable legislation pending in congress 
sen joseph lieberman dconn said friday that by failing to 
endorse regulation of cable television rates the fcc does nothing 
to protect consumers now from cable monopolists 
lieberman along with rep christopher shays rconn has 
introduced a bill to return rate regulation of most cable 
programming to state and local authorities lieberman said it will 
be years before a truly competitive cable market emerges 
sikes who has been quoted as saying his job is to regulate 
denied that he had been told by congress or the white house to 
back off on cable 
the house and senate bills would require the fcc to regulate 
basic cable prices or delegate such authority to municipal 
officials

the best way to teach the nations 
preschoolers is simple according to a group of school principals 
let them do what interests them and give them a stimulating 
classroom to explore 
formal academic environments for 3 and 4yearolds can stunt 
childrens interest in education the national association of 
elementary school principals said friday 
instead association officials say teachers should let kids 
learn by playing freely explore the classroom and do handson 
activities 
the associations report early childhood education and the 
elementary school principal has recommendations and a checklist 
of 28 standards that teachers schools and parents can apply to 
change the structured teacherdirected learning process to a 
flexible stimulating one 
a daily classroom routine should provide a balance of 
teacherdirected and childinitiated activities active and quiet 
activities independent and guided activities and large group 
small group and individual group activities the report says 
among the associations recommendations are that school programs 
should give children a strong sense of selfesteem social and 
communication skills and a curiosity for learning 
children should be assessed and measured by observation not 
tested for success or failure no letter grades should be used 
the book recommends 
the report which echoes a number of other studies was released 
one day before the national governors association was to offer its 
strategies for states to reach six national education goals that 
make improvements in early childhood education a priority 
these kids are not just younger versions of our first 
graders said samuel sava executive director of the principals 
association they do not learn in the same ways that older 
children learn and their education programs should not be 
patterned after traditional elementary grade programs 
the number of 3 and 4yearold children attending some kind of 
preschool program has increased by 29 percent since 1965 according 
to the us department of education 
the reason association official said is that the american 
family has changed 
in most homes both parents work or the family is headed by a 
single working parent these families rely on preschool programs to 
care for their children 
another reason for the rise in the younger school population is 
the pressure for achievement association officials said parents 
think that if children start school earlier the youngsters will be 
better prepared for later academic success 
association officials said traditional academic learning should 
begin no earlier than the third grade 
the national association of elementary school principals 
established in 1921 is a professional organization serving more 
than 26000 elementary and middle school principals in the united 
states canada and overseas

an unsuccessful eastman kodak bid to make the 
hubble space telescope mirrors called for a second company to 
double check the grinding and polishing a provision not offered by 
low bidder perkinelmer the firm that produced the flawed hubble 
mirror 
the kodak bid submitted to nasa for manufacture of the hubble 
mirrors called for kodak to make one primary mirror within its 
plant and for itek optical systems to make an identical primary 
mirror at another plant 
nasa made the bid proposal documents available in response to a 
freedom of information petition 
in its proposal kodak said that the two mirrors and the 
different testing systems of the two companies could be used to 
verify the prescription one of the two primary mirrors would then 
be used in the hubble space telescope 
nasa officials however awarded the contract to perkinelmer 
the danbury conn firm now known as hughes danbury optical 
systems did its own mirror grinding and polishing and used its own 
personnel and equipment to check the mirror prescriptions 
perkinelmers winning bid was 6428 million kodaks proposal 
was for 9979 million through overruns the perkinelmer contract 
climbed to an eventual total of 451 million 
the hubble space telescope which was launched in april has 
been found to have a focusing flaw in either the primary or 
secondary mirror this error nasa officials have said means the 
15 billion telescope is now able to capture images that are only 
about half as clear as those planned 
dick wollensak a vice president of itek which is now a 
subsidiary of litton industries said that the losing kodakitek 
bid called for a socalled endtoend test that would have 
detected any flaw in the mirrors before the telescope was launched 
we werent going to build those things and then not test them 
after they were assembled he said in a telephone interview 
between kodak and itek there were facilities to test the 
assembled optical system without a major modification 
nasa officials have said that the perkinelmer optical assembly 
was not tested after it was put together because it would have 
required a test facility that may have cost more than 100 million 
as a result the telescope was launched into space without ever 
being optically tested as an assembled unit the focusing error was 
not discovered until the telescope was in orbit 
wollensak said that the perkinelmer design did not allow for 
the primary mirror to be tested after it was placed into the 
assembled telescope he said that the instrument was designed to 
work in zero gravity and that the gravity of earth caused the glass 
to sag slightly which would have changed the focus 
kodak and itek however said wollensak had developed a way to 
prevent the sag and thus test the mirrors as an assembled unit 
wollensak said he believes cost was a major factor in nasa 
selecting perkinelmer to make the hubble optics 
nasa had developed their own version of what it should cost 
and that was lower than the itekkodak bid said wollensak 
they felt that the perkinelmer bid was low but they thought 
that the difference between the nasa expectation and the 
perkinelmer bid would cover the overrun 
as it turned out the final cost was seven times more than the 
perkinelmer bid wollensak said that the kodakitek bid would have 
avoided many of the problems that led to the perkinelmer overruns 
a nasa committee investigating the flawed hubble telescope plans 
to return to perkinelmers plant in danbury on aug 15 for two 
more days of testimony and a review of documents and equipment 
related to the flawed optics 
the committee met for two days this week in danbury and an 
engineer who was there said it may take weeks to find the precise 
mistake that caused the flawed focus 
the engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
investigation is like looking for a bookkeeping error it will go 
on and on 
nasa hopes to be able to have an optical prescription for the 
error before the exact cause is found however once it can be 
described mathematically engineers can make lenses for a 
replacement hubble camera that will correct the fuzzy focus for 
that camera 
nasa plans to send a space shuttle to the orbiting telescope in 
june 1993 and spacewalking astronauts will replace the old camera 
with one that has the corrective lenses other instruments will be 
replaced in later years

the senate has given final parliamentary 
approval to legislation allowing the transfer of governmentowned 
industries to private investors that accounts for 80 percent of 
polish industries 
the senate voted 607 with two abstentions thursday to approve 
the law as passed by the sejm or lower house of parliament on 
july 13 
the senate offered no amendments to the legislation it adopted 
a resolution calling for quick work by the solidarityled 
government to prepare regulations for implementing it 
although privatization is considered crucial to the effort to 
create a capitalist system from the centralized socialist economy 
controversy over how the heavily monopolized and often outmoded 
stateowned industries should be put into private hands delayed 
passage of the legislation for months 
none of the 7600 stateowned industries will be considered 
offlimits to privatization it is expected that only about a dozen 
of the major factories will be privatized the first year although 
the sale or lease of small stateowned shops restaurants and 
services are progressing more quickly 
all citizens are to be given bonds that can be exchanged for 
company stocks allowing even the estimated 65 percent of polish 
families with no savings to participate 
there is widespread concern that economically depressed poland 
will be bought out by westerners seeking less expensive 
properties in central europe this is directed most strongly at 
neighboring germany 
in a reflection of this concern the sejm voted friday to bar 
the sale of governmentowned real estate to nonpoles the vote was 
224136 with seven abstentions 
the law does not apply to privately owned land which currently 
can be sold to foreigners with the permission of the interior 
ministry 
the threat to poland that could result from wholesale land 
purchases by foreigners has stirred concern private land now sells 
for 15 per square yard in the warsaw area 
the envisioned economic might of a united germany has coupled 
with vivid memories of its 1939 military invasion to focus distrust 
on germans 
it wouldnt be a problem if they the foreign property 
purchasers were americans said one parliament member friday 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
sejm deputy anna dynowska told the official pap news agency that 
the law still does not solve the problem because privately owned 
land can be purchased by foreigners 
so we may face the situation where foreigners will be buying 
land from poles who bought it earlier from the state she said

for months louisianas legislature had 
been grabbing the headlines on abortion and record labeling but 
this week it was gov buddy roemers turn 
roemer made headlines of his own wednesday and again friday by 
undoing what the legislature did regarding record labeling and 
abortion 
on wednesday he vetoed a bill that would have required the 
recording industry to put warning labels on records deemed to 
promote deviant sex drug abuse violence suicide or ritualism 
it also would have sent retailers to jail if they sold the 
labeled recordings to minors 
roemer said that as a parent he really wanted to sign the bill 
after reading lyrics of some of the trashy music 
but he vetoed the measure because he believed it threatened 
first amendment rights 
on friday he vetoed an abortion bill that was hastily thrown 
together on july 8 the measure would have sent doctors who perform 
abortions to jail for up to 10 years 
although it contained rape and incest exceptions that roemer 
said he wanted the governor said friday that the rape exception 
was too narrowly drawn to truly protect a rape victims right to 
abortion 
the dust wont settle for some time a move is afoot among some 
conservative lawmakers to call a rare veto session in 
midaugust and attempt to override the roemer vetos 
susan howell a pollster and political science professor at the 
university of new orleans said such a session is unlikely because 
lawmakers wont want to go through the politically divisive debates 
again 
but howell added you dont make much money betting on 
the louisiana legislature

tv marti the governmentsponsored television 
station making test broadcasts to cuba is reaching a small 
audience outside havana despite jamming by the castro government 
president bush told congress friday 
a feasibility study conducted by the voice of america and 
submitted to congressional leaders by the president reached no 
conclusions as to the future of the operation 
the president is expected to make a determination this summer as 
to whether tv marti should be made permanent 
the voa said a clear signal of excellent quality reaches 
havana from the transmitter at cudjoe key fla and does so 
without interference to foreign or domestic channels 
the report said there is widespread interest among cubans in 
seeing the broadcasts despite the jamming and the fact that they 
are carried during early morning hours to avoid interfering with 
cuban daytime broadcasting on the same channel 
tv marti provides news and entertainment programs 
although there is no effective way to overcome cuban jamming 
there are areas where jamming does not interfere with the tv marti 
signal the voa said 
the report estimated that possibly 50000 to 70000 individuals 
could occasionally view tv marti 
the population of cuba is 1024 million 
a survey commissioned by the us information agency of cuban 
immigrants and visitors arriving in miami found that 28 percent of 
households in the primary target area for tv marti should be able 
to receive the broadcasts at least occasionally this would be 
about 273000 households 
president fidel castro of cuba has called tv marti a gross 
instrument of subversion and jammed it signal from the day 
programming began

a roadside bomb activated by a beam of 
light blasted the luxury sedan of a senior government 
terrorismfighter friday but he escaped serious injury a leftist 
terrorist group claimed responsibility 
the attack on hans neusel no 2 at the interior ministry in 
charge of counterterrorism marked a comeback by the red army 
faction after last months roundup in east germany of eight 
suspected members of the terrorist gang 
the government friday evening offered a 30000 reward for 
information leading to apprehension of the attackers 
federal investigators said a red mazda 323 may have been used in 
the attack with terrorists perhaps posing as construction workers 
or landscapers to plant the bomb 
the explosion smashed in the right side of neusels bmw blew 
out windows ripped apart upholstery and sprung open its trunk and 
hood it blew a crater in the road near an autobahn exit in bonn 
and twisted an iron guardrail 
neusel 62 walked away with a few cuts on his right hand and 
arm he pushed the car off the highway to keep it from blocking 
traffic 
his injuries could have been far worse had he been a passenger 
rather than driving officials said west german television said 
neusels chauffeur was on vacation and he was alone in the car 
the red army faction claimed responsibility in a note left near 
the scene 
also discovered at the site was a sophisticated lightbeam 
device similar to one used in the gangs killing in november of 
deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen whose car was blown up near 
frankfurt 
the terrorist gang has been responsible for killings and bomb 
attacks in west germany in the last two decades 
about three hours after the morning attack neusel strode into a 
news conference and said he was happy to be alive 
speaking in a calm voice neusel described the impact of the 
bomb blast saying naturally the sensation of shock was there 
neusel also said the note claiming responsibility indicated a 
connection between the red army faction and a spanish terror group 
called grapo 
the letter carried the red army faction symbol a red star 
superimposed by a machine gun the letter said the attack was 
carried out by the jose manuel sevillano commando 
according to the federal prosecutors office sevillano was a 
convicted member of grapo who died in may after a sixmonth hunger 
strike 
the interior ministry said neusel had no security detail and 
his automobile was not equipped with armor plating or bulletproof 
glass 
fridays bombing was the first red army faction attack since 
eight longsought fugitives were captured in east germany in recent 
weeks 
the eight had been living there under assumed names some say 
they had been granted sanctuary by east germanys former communist 
government 
also friday law officials announced that one of the eight has 
been released for lack of evidence 
ekkehard von seckendorffgudent a 50yearold doctor was 
picked up june 14 as a suspect in a 1984 bank robbery in the west 
german city of wuerzburg 
the west german prosecutors office said he was released by east 
german authorities after witnesses were unable to identify him as a 
participant in the robbery 
the prosecutors office said it did not immediately appear the 
attack on neusel was in reprisal for the roundup since the 
assassination attempt was likely mapped out before the suspects 
were nabbed 
neusel called on the red army faction to cease its campaign of 
violence 
i appeal emphatically for you to give this up he said 
even if you were successful how would that have changed the fact 
that we are a free democracy

comedian roseanne barr admitted 
friday that it was a mistake for her to screech the national anthem 
to an audience of booing baseball fans but she refused to 
apologize and denied being rude 
the star of the toprated abctv comedy roseanne said she 
nearly left the field in midsong wednesday as san diego baseball 
fans at jack murphy stadium bombarded her with boos 
im sorry i didnt sing so good what else do i have to say 
she said i figured everybody knew i wasnt the worlds greatest 
singer 
barr said she realized how horrible the reaction was within 
three or four notes of beginning the starspangled banner 
between games of a doubleheader 
then everybody started booing me and i went into this panic 
thing she told a raucous news conference at the beverly hilton 
hotel which included the police ejection of a photographer it 
took all the guts ive got in my life to finish singing 
more than 2000 phone calls about her unmelodious performance 
had come into the padres switchboard by midday friday and 
president bush joined the chorus of boos 
barr said she had the best of intentions although she refused 
to apologize she used the word sorry several times 
im not going to apologize for doing it she said because 
i feel like it was the wrong choice for all of us to make but not 
anybody anticipated that it would be this negative 
she capped her solo by grabbing her crotch and spitting 
actions she described as a parody of a baseball player not a 
response to the boos 
i probably should have waited a while before i scratched 
myself and spit she said but i wanted to get out of there 
the news conference became as chaotic as her television show 
when her husband ordered police to eject a tabloid photographer 
i want the cameras off right now bellowed barrs husband 
tom arnold as three policemen arrived 
photographer kip rano of american photo syndicate was led from 
the meeting room of the beverly hilton hotel after police warned 
him he would be handcuffed and arrested if he refused to leave 
the incident carried live by local television stations and cnn 
delayed the news conference for more than 20 minutes 
in a hollywood twist rano was escorted out by police officer 
paul kramer the same motorcycle patrolman who arrested and was 
slapped by zsa zsa gabor last year 
barr said she had rano expelled because im not going to talk 
to the tabloids im suing them 
she said she planned to file a libel lawsuit against the 
national enquirer next week 
rano said his firm sells photos to everyone including 
tabloid newspapers he called the expulsion a publicity stunt by 
arnold and barr 
barr the padres and tom werner roseannes executive 
producer and the owner of the padres thought it was going to be 
fun to have the portly comic sing the national anthem on a night 
at the stadium honoring working women about 30000 fans attended 
i did it for free on my day off she said i took my kids 
down there why would i have taken my kids down there if i didnt 
think it would be fun 
bush joined the ringing chorus of boos friday for barrs 
rendition of the anthem 
it was disgraceful bush said 
thats the way i feel about it and i think a lot of san diego 
fans said the same thing bush said while flying to 
kennebunkport maine for the weekend 
told of bushs comment barr replied im sorry i didnt sing 
so good id like to hear him sing it 
barr said she never would have performed if there had been any 
objections 
if there had been even 50 calls that came in that said dont 
do it i wouldnt have but there wasnt even one 
none of us meant it viciously tom werner the padres and 
me she said we all made a mistake

the defense rested in marion barrys drug and 
perjury trial friday keeping barry off the stand rather than give 
prosecutors a chance to question him before the jury 
prosecutors immediately began their rebuttal case attacking the 
accuracy of the testimony of four witnesses who had appeared at the 
trial on barrys behalf 
i have advised mr barry that no matter how we restrict his 
testimony he would still be subject to crossexamination r 
kenneth mundy one of barrys attorneys told the judge 
mundy said he had told barry he could have expected to face 
all the questions prosecutors wanted to ask about the numerous 
allegations of drug use 
prosecutors said they expected to complete their rebuttal case 
on monday mundy said he wants to recall two witnesses following 
the governments rebuttal us district court judge thomas 
penfield jackson said closing arguments would be next tuesday or 
wednesday 
barry told reporters later he wanted to avoid the theatrics his 
tesimony would have produced it would have been good perry mason 
drama la law drama but im not about perry mason drama he 
said 
my spirits are high my defense is on course 
the prosecution tried to strike back quickly friday introducing 
a city form indicating a defense witness had been absent from work 
at a time he has testified he had accepted a document figuring 
prominently in one of the charges against barry 
cliff roberson an assistant to longtime barry aide anita bonds 
has testified he took a job application from admitted cocaine 
dealer lydia reid pearson shortly after 10 am on sept 7 1988 
pearson has testified she handed the application and crack 
cocaine to barry that morning 
the form indicates that roberson was absent for two hours that 
day the typewritten original portion says he was missing from 430 
pm until 630 pm but that time is scratched out and the hours 
830 am to 1030 am are handwritten above it 
the form signed by bonds included a handwritten note 
indicating that roberson had been laying a gravestone for my 
fathers grave that morning 
former bonds assistant darcelle walker testified that she typed 
the form and also said she recognized bonds signature she 
identified the handwriting in the margin as robersons but said 
under crossexamination she didnt know who had written in the 
changes on the form 
the charge involved is the most specific of the drug possession 
charges with regard to date and time of the 10 the mayor faces 
he is also charged with conspiracy and with three felony counts of 
perjury 
as assistant us attorney judith retchin introduced the form on 
friday barry huddled briefly with bonds at the defense table and 
then turned away with a scowl on his face 
bonds who had been managing barrys reelection campaign 
volunteered her services to the mayors legal defense after he 
dropped his plans for a fourth term 
the defense plans to bring roberson back to the witness stand 
next week if the judge will allow it said mundy 
after the trial the mayor said he believed roberson had been at 
work when pearson left the application adding i know i didnt 
take it 
as part of its rebuttal case the prosecution also called 
delois mise who testified that she saw barry bodyguard police 
officer james stays snort cocaine at a 1985 party stays had 
testified for the defense that he never saw barry use drugs on a 
march 1988 trip to the virgin islands stays denied that he himself 
had used drugs at the 1985 party mundy said he wants to recall 
stays next week 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
department planned an internal investigation of stays as soon as 
the trial is over 
terry lee brenay the skipper of a sailboat in the virgin 
islands he contradicted the testimony of a virgin islands couple 
who said they didnt have any indication of drug use during a june 
1986 boat ride with barry brenay said he and the couple smelled 
marijuana smoke aboard the vessel the couple albert and carmen 
benjamin expressed alarm over the smell said brenay 
mundy concluded his sevenday defense of the mayor by closely 
questioning the fbi agent in charge of the sting operation in which 
barry was arrested after being videotaped smoking crack cocaine 
agent ronald stern should have stopped the jan 18 operation 
before barry actually smoked the drug mundy argued 
what would you suggest i say to rasheeda stern retorted 
the stings off throw away the drugs 
stern was referring to exmodel rasheeda moore a former barry 
girlfriend who had persuaded the mayor to come to her hotel room 
an undercover agent posing as moores friend supplied the crack 
while stern monitored the operation from an adjoining room 
stern repeatedly said that it was barry not moore who brought 
up the subject of drugs and asked for them 
before stern took the stand for additional questioning and 
before the jury was called into the courtroom prosecutor retchin 
heatedly denied an assertion by mundy that stern had been part of 
an assault force targeting black elected officials for drug 
arrests

the opposition said during his announcement i am sorry the 
guards didnt give me a pistol 
bta said the minister quit the chamber after an opposition 
deputy alluded to alleged strongarm tactics by police against 
demonstrators an apparent reference to a government warning to 
local authorities to halt spreading ethnic and political unrest 
the deputy suggested members of parliament speak to the 
demonstrators outside after it emerged that the opposition was 
split over whether zhivkovs speech should be broadcast live no 
date has been set for zhivkovs appearance 
zhivkov 78 was ousted last nov 10 in a politburo coup none 
of the old guard communist leaders in eastern europe has as yet 
spoken out publicly about the past possible revelations about 
zhivkovs harsh 35year rule have helped to make his expected 
speech a highly emotional and controversial issue here 
zhivkov has been under house arrest and in custody in a military 
hospital he is under investigation for alleged abuses of power and 
misappropriation of state property he has also been accused of 
fomenting ethnic unrest with his assimilation campaign against the 
ethnic turkish minority 
zhivkov asked to be allowed to speak before parliament to tell 
the bulgarian people the truth about his rule parliament debated 
on friday the conditions for allowing such an address 
a parliamentary commission proposed that zhivkovs speech should 
be taped before being broadcast to allow possible deletion of state 
secrets bta said 
it said that minutes after this proposal was broadcast on radio 
thousands of angry bulgarians converged on the parliament building 
shouting zhivkov before the people the crowd later dwindled 
to hundreds bta reported 
the deputies agreed to postpone further debate until monday 
observers say leaders of the socialist party formerly the 
communist party are concerned that zhivkov could say something 
that would hurt them politically by implicating them in unpopular 
decisions of the previous hardline government 
the socialists won 211 of the 400 seats in parliament in last 
months free elections the main opposition alliance union of 
democratic forces won 144 
hundreds of people have camped outside socialist party 
headquarters demanding that zhivkov and others be brought to 
account 
protesters and striking students last month forced petar 
mladenov to resign as president over a call he made last december 
for tanks to be used against antigovernment demonstrators 
parliament has failed in four rounds of voting to elect a new 
president the new government cannot be formed until the president 
has been elected 
bta meanwhile reported friday that rationing of sugar soap and 
some other basics was introduced in several bulgarian cities 
because of acute shortages

members of a druggrowing cult suspected of 
making human sacrifices testified friday that police had beaten 
them and forced them to sign false admissions of murder 
authorities have descended on a rural western town to search for 
up to 41 bodies of cult victims but they were delayed by bad 
weather friday 
police have quoted cult members as saying they made sacrifices 
to the devil whom they believed was embodied in a 16inch 
earthenware statue of a monkey they reportedly called the statue 
el amigo or the friend 
however district judge cuevas zavala played down the cult 
charge friday there is nothing to it said the judge hearing 
the case in tepic the nayarit state capital about 450 miles 
northwest of mexico city he did not elaborate 
some of the 14 suspects arrested in the case testified at their 
arraignment friday that police had beaten them into signing 
accusations of murder against olayo soto soto the 65yearold 
alleged leader of the cult 
other suspects handcuffed in pairs made the same claims in 
interviews with reporters outside the courthouse 
the purported cult leader pointed to a dark spot under his eye 
and to other parts of his body and said he was beaten into 
confessing to killing three alleged victims 
soto soto who was wearing traditional white garb of an indian 
medicine man said he was a good catholic 
another suspect epifanio soto said he grew only apples 
peaches and prickly pears we are peaceful peasant workers he 
said 
he said the group had a temple in a cave there we had saints 
the saint jesus christ and the virgin of guadelupe mexicos 
patron saint he said 
of the monkey idol he said the authorities must have 
mistaken the virgin of guadelupe for it 
the accused appeared friday on the drug charges which district 
judge jose cuevas zavala said could take 10 months to prosecute 
confessions made without an attorney present are admissible in 
mexico although the accused are permitted to recant them in court 
later they almost invariably do so 
because there is no bail under mexican law for people accused of 
crimes that carry a sentence of five years or more the suspects 
likely will remain in jail the whole time their case is prosecuted 
authorities say the victims were killed and buried by the 
marijuanagrowers in a remote area along the line separating 
nayarit and durango states over a sevenyear period 
the human sacrifices were made in the belief they would protect 
the drug crop from police authorities said 
nine men and five youths have been held by police in tepic since 
tuesday they are charged with homicide arms possession criminal 
association and drug offenses 
alejandro maldonado loyo who represents the federal prosecutor 
in tepic said friday all 14 had confessed to marijuana charges he 
said the homicide charges would be handled by state officials in 
durango because the bodies reportedly were buried on that side of 
the line 
he said the marijuana patches were small their sacrifices 
didnt bring them many results did they he said 
the nayarit district attorneys investigator jose fernand armas 
hernandez said thursday tht police found a leather quiver with 41 
arrows apparently dipped in blood 
one suspect claimed the arrows represented the spirits of each 
of the sacrificed humans the investigator said 
authorities said the occult rites were practiced in caves on 
remote hillsides where police discovered apparent cult material 
including a statuette of the virgin mary with her face replaced by 
a skull 
federal police said the group claimed to be practicing a version 
f palo mayombe a religion that originated in the congo and 
sometimes uses human skulls 
the group is reminiscent of another drug cult broken in april 
1989 when police found 15 bodies buried on a ranch near the city 
of matamoros across the usmexico border from brownsville texas 
four members of that group are on trial in mexico city and 
matamoros alleged group leader adolfo de jesus constanzo and his 
bodyguard died of gunshot wounds as police closed in on them in a 
mexico city apartment in may 1989

the pentagons chief procurement official said 
friday he would not prohibit northrop corp from building weapons 
for the military despite the justice departments belief that the 
company should be barred 
im not anticipating any debarment procedure john betti 
undersecretary of defense for acquisitions told reporters during a 
break in a sixhour hearing by a house energy and commerce panel on 
charges of fraud and mismanagement at northrop 
justice department officials described how northrop falsified 
reports on the airlaunched cruise missile and conducted improper 
tests on the harrier av8b jet 
the companys action led to its guilty plea in february on 34 
charges of fraud and a fine of 17 million the largest criminal 
fine ever imposed on a defense contractor 
the last witness before the panel a former northrop employee 
who has filed a false claims lawsuit against the company charged 
that the air force adjusted the budget targets on the b2 bomber 
when it realized the program was financially out of control 
we paid northrop 26 billion to build a new type of paper 
airplane that carried this nations debts to new heights 
jeanfrancois truong who worked as one of eight financial 
comptrollers for the 14000man b2 work force in pico rivera 
calif and blew the whistle on northrop told the panel 
northrop is still the target of federal grand jury criminal 
investigations and justice department officials were reticent 
about discussing specifics 
pressed however about whether the justice department stood by 
the contention spelled out in a series of memoranda from march to 
june that northrop should be barred from weapons contracts agency 
officials did not retreat 
are they still your beliefs today the department officials 
were asked 
they havent changed said william f fahey assistant us 
attorney for the central district of california 
another justice department official mark m richard deputy 
assistant attorney general for the criminal division detailed for 
the subcommittee on oversight and investigations how northrop 
pressured the navy and air force to change contract specifications 
seriously damaging a fraud inquiry 
under questioning richard said there are civil proceedings 
under way in connection with evidence of false testing by northrop 
on parts for the mx nuclear missile 
the legal action involving the b2 stealth bomber the costliest 
weapon the military is building at nearly 860 million a copy 
relates to problems with northrops cost system 
asked to name a single northrop weapons program in which the 
government has no evidence of criminal activity richard said he 
was unable to answer that question and would have to check the 
departments records 
pressed however as to whether the justice department would 
contract with a company like northrop richard said i would hope 
not 
lawmakers reacted angrily to the details provided to the 
committee about northrops operation especially in light of the 
fact that the company has received more than 35 billion in 
pentagon contracts 
northrop appears to have been engaged in a continuing criminal 
enterprise for a long time said rep john dingell dmich and 
the subcommittees chairman 
truong accused northrop of maintaining two separate financial 
books with actual charges included in an operating set and another 
set prepared by the financial department for the air force 
the former employee who said he resigned because of fraud and 
abuse recommended that the government bar or prosecute the company 
to stop northrop from cheating the taxpayers of this country 
in addition to manufacturing the b2 bomber northrop is bidding 
for the right to build the air forces advanced tactical fighter 
dingell also expressed frustration at the refusal of thomas v 
jones chairman of the board of northrop to testify before the 
panel even though the subcommittee had issued a subpoena 
mr jones was invited to testify today but refused on the 
grounds that one of his several attorneys is in africa dingell 
said 
the subpoena has been in existence since last year but the 
committee decided not to enforce it this time because it expected 
jones to refuse to answer on the grounds he was testifying without 
his counsel 
dingell told his staff shortly after the hearing he wants to 
enforce the subpoena against jones at another hearing in september 
otherwise the panel would vote on whether to hold the northrop 
official for contempt of congress 
but much of the anger among lawmakers was directed at betti who 
said that defense department officials overseeing management at 
northrop have assured me that all monitoring systems necessary to 
protect the interests of the taxpayers and national security are 
currently in place and working well at northrop 
i have serious doubts about whether youre the man for the job 
that you hold said rep john bryant dtexas as he questioned 
why the pentagon still does business with northrop when the 
chairman of the board jones has been convicted of felonious 
offenses

president bush gave david souter a 
ride back to new england on air force one friday saying he was 
pleased with the nations reaction to the littleknown supreme 
court nominee and predicting senate confirmation with flying 
colors 
addressing the closest thing to a controversy so far bush 
denied that he had agreed before meeting souter last monday not to 
ask him delicate questions about his views on controversial issues 
such as abortion 
two senators have quoted souter as saying he had requested that 
such questions not be asked and bush has said he didnt ask them 
but bush when asked whether he had made such a deal in advance 
of interviewing his prospective high court choice said no 
nothing on my side on that 
meanwhile sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the 
senate judiciary committee announced the panel will open hearings 
on souters nomination on sept 13 
souter after a hectic week in washington readying for the 
confirmation hearings flew with bush aboard the presidential 
aircraft to pease air force base in new hampshire then went his 
own way while bush and his wife barbara flew to kennebunkport by 
helicopter to their oceanside summer home 
the laconic souter briefly appeared in the press cabin aboard 
air force one but quickly retreated after quipping i dont want 
to ruin my reputation i have two words to say hi and 
goodbye 
on the ground when reporters asked the 50yearold federal 
appeals judge how it felt to be back in new hampshire he replied 
it feels damn good he then drove off with a friend tom rath 
and raths twin children to visit his mother at a retirement 
community in concord 
rath said souter hopes to visit friends do his laundry get 
some rest and try to disappear while digging into a pile of 
reading in preparation for his confirmation hearings 
earlier friday in washington souter continued his 
getacquainted meetings with senators fending off reporters 
questions on specific issues primarily abortion rights 
i think with respect that that is certainly a question that 
im going to be asked when the time for the confirmation hearing 
comes and i think that would be the appropriate place for me to 
respond he said 
souter also met with vice president dan quayle who later said 
the senate should avoid rancorous partisanship and resist 
arguments of special interest groups that might oppose the nominee 
quayle said some groups have taken the position that if we 
dont know in advance that judge souter is for us on our single 
issue we oppose him he named no groups 
bush answering questions during the flight north declined to 
retort to sharp criticisms leveled at him and souter by supreme 
court justice thurgood marshall in a television interview on abctv 
thursday 
marshall said he had never heard of souter and said white house 
chief of staff john sununu appeared to be calling the shots on 
the selection of bush marshall said its said that if you 
cant say something good about a dead person dont say it well i 
consider him dead 
bush said my response is that i have great respect for the 
supreme court and i have no comment on it none i have a very 
high regard for separation of powers and for the supreme court 
in boston attorney general dick thornburgh told a news 
confernece he was saddened by marhsalls remarks 
i believe it is the first time any sitting supreme court 
justice has ever in our history criticized an appointment and 
indeed criticized the president who made the appointment 
thornburgh said 
i dont believe that is a constructive attitude to have on the 
eve of consideration by the senate of the nomination of a man 
possessed by extraordinary qualitites of intellect integrity and 
character 
thornburgh denied that bush sought a nominee with unknown views 
of abortion like souters the question of aqny nominees views 
on abortion was not considered he said 
back in washington senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
was less reticent calling marshall a very partisan liberal 
democrat and suggesting political views will also be reflected 
in his judicial opinions 
bush who nominated souter monday just three days after the 
retirement of the courts foremost liberal william j brennan jr 
called reaction to souter very favorable so far 
its hard to tell about the senate because a lot have not 
expressed their views but nationally im very pleased said 
bush there seems to be welldeserved support for judge souter 
bush acknowledged souter is not the most well known figure in 
the country but thats not why i selected him 
hell be plenty well known when he gets testifying and gets 
through this process which i think hell do with flying colors 
said the president 
some critics have suggested bush did choose souter in part 
because he has not written widely on controversial issues 
as for souters job interview bush has said he purposely 
avoided asking questions on sensitive issues because he thought 
that was appropriate 
sen warren rudman rnh considered a main souter sponsor in 
the selection process also flew to new hampshire on the plane he 
said the judge had not set preconditions for the white house 
interview but had expressed concern about questions he would be 
asked 
rudman quoted souter as telling him last weekend im aware 
there are a lot of issues of great concern to many people in public 
life you know im a sitting judge on the 1st circuit and i just 
would be very embarrassed to be asked questions because i could not 
answer them i would not want to put the president or anybody else 
in that position 
rudman said he relayed souters concerns to white house sununu 
who assured him it was not our policy to grill jurists on how 
they would rule on specific issues

a house armed services subcommittee pared more 
than 5 billion from the pentagons budget on friday by continuing 
a hiring freeze for civilians and slashing maintenance funds for 
overseas bases congressional sources said friday 
the panel on readiness cut force structure support costs by 59 
billion from president bushs original proposal of 793 billion to 
meet levels set under a house budget resolution approved on may 1 
the action came in advance of tuesdays session of the full 
house armed services committee which is expected to craft a 1991 
military budget of 283 billion 24 billion less than president 
bush sought in january 
the lawmakers approved a 109 billion reduction in pay for the 
pentagons civilian work force which currently numbers around 1 
million people 
they also approved continuing the hiring freeze that was 
introduced earlier this year by defense secretary dick cheney as 
a means of reducing the civilian work force said the 
congressional source who spoke on condition of not being 
identified by name 
this would mean 60000 to 65000 fewer jobs for the civilians 
who work for the military during the next fiscal year which begins

the panel also slashed 914 million in funding from accounts for 
maintaining property overseas a move made in line with anticipated 
base closures abroad due to the lessening soviet threat the source

in line with base closures the panel also approved a 324 million 
reduction in their pay and benefits 
among other things the lawmakers made 920 million in 
acrosstheboard cuts in the militarys operation and maintenance

a mistrial was declared friday in raymond 
buckeys second trial on charges he molested children at the 
mcmartin preschool and prosecutors said they wouldnt try him a 
third time 
the prosecutors decision following a jury deadlock on eight sex 
counts ended the longest costliest criminal case in us history 
it is clear to me that the jury will not reach a verdict in 
this case on any of the counts superior court judge stanley 
weisberg said in declaring the mistrial 
votes on seven of the eight counts leaned toward acquittal and 
deputy district attorney joseph martinez said buckey would not be 
tried again 
the community has had enough we gave it our best shot 
martinez said these kids cannot be mcmartin kids for the rest of 
their lives its been a horrible experience 
buckey said he would not be happy until weisberg makes a final 
ruling at a hearing wednesday on whether to abide by the 
prosecution motion to dismiss 
no one has won in the mcmartin case one or two buckey 
said i was innocent coming in and im still innocent because i 
wasnt found guilty 
the lack of resolution was another bizarre development in the 
mcmartin case which has consumed seven years of court time and 
cost los angeles county more than 135 million 
during a news conference district attorney ira reiner conceded 
there were fundamental problems with the evidence in this case 
that go back six or seven years 
but he said he did not regret going through with the second 
trial 
the parents felt it was important there would be a 
resolution he said i think its clear now there cannot be 
defense attorney danny davis said the ordeal would never be over 
for the parents 
its a horrible predicament to consider it didnt happen 
and they bought into a circus he said 
even one of the most outspoken parents who had demanded the 
retrial said she had tired of the battle 
i really wasnt surprised jackie mcgauley said of the 
mistrial people are real divided on this issue i feel such 
relief that its over id like to get on with the work of seeing 
that the justice system is changed to accommodate children 
asked what he would do with the rest of his life buckey said 
im just going to go on ive learned to endure a lot of things 
in seven years i would like to be just left alone 
ill have to get a job now he added with a smile 
buckeys father charles said he was disappointed his son was 
not acquitted 
ive lost faith in the district attorneys office he said 
every one of these people has lied and been very deceitful 
divided on all counts the jurors were unanimous on one thing 
that the case should not be tried again 
there are too many questions too many gaping holes and its 
too much time to spend said juror michael carapella a 
25yearold musician 
jury foreman richard dunham told the judge that an extra week of 
deliberation which came after the panel reported earlier 
deadlocks only resulted in splitting jurors further 
early friday they retracted two unanimous verdicts they 
submitted in sealed envelopes reporting they were deadlocked on 
those counts as well 
dunham said the panelists had divided their votes differently on 
the eight counts with the splits ranging from 66 to 111 
the jurors took the same route an earlier jury took last 
january choosing not to decide because they could not agree 
whether buckey was guilty or innocent of molesting three young 
girls as long as 10 years ago at his familys manhattan beach 
preschool 
a number of jurors said they felt the crucial pieces of evidence 
dividing them were the videotapes made by childrens institute 
international in which therapists interviewed toddlers about 
whether they were molested 
the cii tapes were in my mind very bad said dunham we 
did not put a lot of credibility in them most of us felt the 
techniques of the interviews were very leading 
another juror complained there was insufficient corroborating 
evidence from witnesses other than the parents to back up the 
childrens stories 
all the evidence i saw in the process to me hes not 
guilty said juror sylvia scrigna 30 a bank employee 
the second abbreviated buckey trial had the feeling of a 
postscript following the first so closely 
before the first trial an 18month preliminary hearing for 
seven original defendants strained the court system and spurred 
calls for reform charges against five defendants all teachers 
were dismissed 
the first trial was a dramatic tableau of passionate advocacy by 
prosecution and defense attorneys determined to prove their points 
it drew capacity audiences of former mcmartin parents as well as 
supporters of the defendants 
a parade of 124 witnesses testified at the first trial in the 
second trial which lasted just three months 46 witnesses 
testified 
a new duo of prosecutors seemed only mildly familiar with the 
facts of the case and less obsessed with winning conviction at all 
costs there were reports they had tried to plea bargain with 
buckey to avoid the second trial a claim they denied 
the witnesses were older and fewer in the first trial of buckey 
and his 63yearold mother peggy mcmartin buckey nine children 
testified the second time three adolescent girls took the stand 
to tell of the time when they were toddlers often they answered 
lawyers questions i dont remember 
buckey who spent five years in jail awaiting resolution of his 
case before he was released on bail denied at both trials he ever 
molested any child 
the mcmartin saga began in august 1983 when a mother called 
manhattan beach police to complain that her child had been molested

opec ministers agreed friday to halt 
overproduction in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil and 
new york experts said us motorists may wind up paying five to 10 
cents more a gallon at the pumps this fall 
all 13 ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries signed an accord to notch up their target price 
immediately from 18 a barrel to 21 
opec president sadek boussena who is algerias oil minister 
said the agreement allows no cheating on production quotas for 
any reason whatsoever 
the cartel set a new production ceiling of 225 million barrels 
a day for the rest of the year 
opec is producing about 23 million to 232 million barrels of 
oil a day well over the ceiling of 221 million in effect in the 
first half of the year 
fridays agreement was struck a little more than a week after 
president saddam hussein of iraq threatened military action against 
overproducers 
chronic oilcheaters kuwait and the united arab emirates 
targets of saddams anger agreed to slash their output by 
hundreds of thousands of barrels a day under the new agreement 
iraqs oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi said in an 
interview his country had to put an end to the excess 
production in opec which depressed oil prices in the spring 
we just cannot let anybody do whatever they like they 
were harming the others he said 
if excess production is indeed curbed crude prices could climb 
several dollars higher by years end when demand for oil increases 
with colder weather in the united states and other consuming 
nations analysts said 
they said higher gasoline prices could follow 
paul mlotok head of energy research at the morgan stanley 
investment firm in new york predicted that with opec restraint 
crude prices could go up a couple of dollars a barrel in the 
octoberdecember period 
this could add about five cents to a gallon of gasoline at the 
pump by the end of the year he said 
nauman barakat first vice president in the energy department at 
shearson lehman hutton in new york said gasoline prices could go 
up even higher by about a dime a gallon 
gasoline prices are going to remain strong in the summer he 
said they will get even stronger going into the winter period 
because of the agreement 
every dollar decline or rise in the price of a barrel of oil 
amounts to a 2cent to 5cent change in gasoline prices 
crude prices were expected to hold steady in august and 
september because of the glut of oil on the market which sent 
prices tumbling in the spring 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec surged 
to 2046 a barrel in early january but skidded to 1364 last 
month 
it has since rebounded to about 1750 not far off the 18 
target which has been in effect since december 1986 
saudi arabias influential oil minister hisham nazer predicted 
crude prices would go beyond the 21 reference price by 
december 
nazer said the accord was designed to prevent deterioration of 
prices this agreement emanated from a very bad situation 
in raising its supply ceiling the cartel lifted the output 
quota of the united arab emirates by 400000 barrels a day to 15 
million barrels howevr the persian gulf producer has been pumping 
up to 2 million barrels a day 
the other dozen nations including kuwait will keep the same 
quotas kuwaits cap is 15 million barrels a day but it too had 
been producing well over that kuwaits oil minister rasheed salem 
alameeri called the deal excellent 
and the uaes mana saeed oteiba promised to toe the line 
it is a good agreement said ecuadors diego tamariz its 
about the best agreement we could get considering 
saddam claimed excess opec production cost financially strapped 
iraq about 14 billion in lost oil revenues in the last year 
while the ministers made no mention publicly of the iraqi 
threats analysts said saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the 
meeting 
they did accomplish a credible agreement said barakat i 
certainly think he saddam was the catalyst 
opec chief boussena said the accord was endorsed by the 
highest level of the members governments but he acknowledged 
opec has no penalties to enforce discipline 
instead the ministers intend to apply peer pressure by 
splitting into two panels to monitor each others production 
the uae for example will be grouped with iraq and saudi 
arabia 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the uae and 
venezuela

boris n yeltsin the reformist president of the 
russian federation agreed friday to negotiate treaties with the 
three baltic republics bypassing the soviet governments central 
authority baltic officials said 
in byelorussia bordering lithuania parliament declared its 
laws take precedence over soviet law and that byelorussia has the 
right to its own armed forces tass news agency said 
the developments came as setbacks to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs plans to glue together the countrys 15 republics in a 
new confederation 
byelorussia is considered to be among the least reformminded 
republics but it followed russia the ukraine and the baltic 
republics in declaring its sovereignty 
while the byelorussian supreme soviet was approving its 
declaration of sovereignty the presidents of lithuania latvia and 
estonia met in jurmala latvia with yeltsin a spokesman said 
negotiations between the three baltic states and russia must 
start immediately the estonian news service said in a report on 
a statement issued by the presidents 
after the talks treaties will be signed between each baltic 
state and russia on political legal economic scientific and 
technical and cultural aspects of mutual relations on relations 
between nationalities and citizenship 
the treaties should be ready in six to eight weeks it said 
latvian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
recognition of the baltic republics independence by the russian 
republic likely would be contained in the treaties but would not 
be made before the agreements are completed 
signing of formal agreements between russia and the 
independenceminded baltic republics would be a stiff blow by 
reformers to gorbachevs efforts to draft a new agreement binding 
the soviet republics together the baltic republics do not want to 
participate in negotiations on the new agreement because they have 
declared their intention to be independent countries 
a russianbaltic accord would signal a serious challenge by 
yeltsin to gorbachevs leadership it could lead to other direct 
agreements among republics that would exclude the soviet government 
and circumvent central authority 
latvias supreme council parliament quoted yeltsin as saying in 
a meeting with latvian officials on thursday that latvian 
independence definitely must be recognized in the first political 
section of our treaty 
a latvian delegation was expected to go to moscow on monday to 
begin talks with yeltsins russian government 
presidents anatoly gorbunov of latvia vytautas landsbergis of 
lithuania and arnold ruutel of estonia also met friday to discuss 
their approach to the negotiations on the new agreement binding the 
soviet republics but no statement emerged 
tass reporting on the declaration approved in the byelorussian 
capital minsk said it was decided that the republic has the 
right to its own military forces its interior forces its organs 
of state and public security under the control of the republics 
supreme soviet 
byelorussia establishes the superiority of the constitution 
and laws of the republic on its territory and its independence in 
external relations 
interfax an unofficial news service affiliated with radio 
moscow said a group of deputies of the byelorussian peoples front 
reform group walked out of the parliamentary session because they 
wanted to debate a declaration of full independence for the 
republic of 10 million people 
the news reports said the declaration was nearly unanimous but 
did not give figures 
in claiming a right to its own armed forces byelorussia 
appeared to be following its southern neighbor the ukraine which 
declared its sovereignty on july 16 
supporters of ukrainian sovereignty said their declaration was 
much stronger than the declaration passed in june by russia 
largest of the soviet republics and which includes moscow the seat 
of federal power 
but all those declarations are milder than the baltic republics 
efforts to become independent lithuania declared independence on 
march 11 and latvia and estonia both declared their intent to 
follow at the end of unspecified transition periods 
after moscow imposed an economic blockade lithuania agreed to 
suspend its declaration of independence for 100 days once talks on 
the matter begin with soviet officials moscow then lifted the 
blockade 
in another republic on the soviet unions western frontier the 
parliament of moldavia on thursday codified its june declaration of 
sovereignty on friday according to tass the lawmakers approved a 
decree stating that all power in the republic belongs to its people 
uzbekistan has also passed a decree seeking more independence 
from central authority and soviet georgia last month established a 
commission to work toward independence

cambodian prime minister hun sen said friday 
he is willing to negotiate with the united states about holding 
elections in his country 
he spoke as secretary of state james baker told the association 
of southeast asian nations that the united states is considering 
direct contacts with the cambodian government baker spoke to the 
organization known as asean on friday in jakarta indonesia 
hun sen in an interview from asia with national public radio 
also said he welcomes the us decision to hold direct talks with 
vietnam on resolving the civil war in his country but he warned 
against intervention in cambodias affairs 
the united states shifting longstanding policy announced last 
week that it would hold talks next month with the communist 
government of vietnam the patron of the hun sen government the 
united states also decided to withhold diplomatic recognition at 
the united nations from the threeparty coalition fighting to 
topple the cambodian government 
i welcome the negotiations between the usa and vietnam over 
cambodia hun sen said but i think they have to admit the fact 
that the issue of the domestic problem of cambodia must be resolved 
only by the people of cambodia he added 
hun sen has opposed a proposal for un forces to oversee the 
installation of a temporary cambodian government and to make sure 
that free elections are held 
but in the interview he said he was personally prepared to 
discuss with the united states government and others to negotiate 
about these issues of general elections in cambodia 
hun sen rejected any role for the khmer rouge in an interim 
government saying it would only open the door for the murderous 
faction to gain a foothold in a permanent government 
the khmer rouge is estimated to have killed over one million 
cambodians when it ruled the country in the 1970s before being 
ousted by a vietnamese invasion in 1979 
any temporary role for the khmer rouge would be a chaos and 
that would also destroy the result of the final political 
solution he said

an aries rocket carrying 
a 20 million star wars experiment was destroyed shortly after 
liftoff because the rockets guidance system failed authorities 
said friday 
this will not significantly affect the program said lt 
col alan r freitag of the strategic defense initiative 
organization in washington its a very unfortunate loss 
certainly but not an insurmountable calamity 
the spear 2 experiment cost 20 million and the launch itself 
cost 1 million he said but the payload was designed to be 
recoverable so it will be difficult to calculate the loss 
the singlestage rocket was launched from white sands missile 
range at 1151 pm wednesday he said 
approximately 35 seconds into the mission flight safety 
determined that the missile was off course freitag said and the 
range missile flight safety officer decided to abort the launch by 
cutting off the rockets boost 
all pieces of the booster and the spear 2 experiment package 
fell within the boundaries of white sands missile range he said 
the payload was to have flown in a suborbital 13minute flight 
reaching an altitude of 124 miles freitag said 
maj bill oconnell of the star wars office in washington said 
the rocket had been scheduled to lift off a week ago but weather 
and other problems delayed the flight until wednesday 
spear 2 which stands for space power experiment aboard rocket 
was designed to provide scientific measurements of highvoltage 
conductors exposed to a space environment he said 
the experiment had undergone testing at the national aeronautics 
and space administrations plum brook space power facility at 
sandusky ohio he said 
the ground tests simulated experimental conditions in space 
freitag said 
but you can only have a certain degree of confidence that 
youve created the space environment on the ground he said 
the launch would have validated information already obtained at 
plum brook 
officials are considering the necessity of repeating the 
experiment in light of costs and the scientific data already 
obtained through ground testing he said 
the senate last month trimmed 1 billion from president bushs 
47 billion budget request for sdi a research effort to develop 
lasers and other exotic weapons that could shoot down nuclear 
missiles fired at the united states

the food and drug administration said friday 
it wants calban 3000 diet tablets and capsules taken off the 
market because they can cause throat obstructions and their 
weightloss claims are unproven 
the agency advised consumers to stop using calban whose main 
ingredient is guar gum a complex sugar that swells with water and 
creates a sense of fullness when eaten 
the fda sent a letter to calbans distributor health care 
products inc of lutz fla saying the agency would take legal 
action against the company if it does not stop distribution of the 
product 
the agency called calban a health hazard based on reports 
of 17 cases in which people experienced throat obstruction after 
eating calban 3000 ten were hospitalized and one died as an 
indirect result of the obstruction when a blood clot reached the 
lungs during surgery the fda said 
last week florida stopped state sales of the product because it 
had reports of 50 cases involving injuries the fda said it has 
asked to review those cases 
company officials could not be reached for comment the 
telephone number for the company which also does business as 
anderson pharmacals of tampa fla reached a recording that said 
the line had been disconnected 
calban is distributed nationally the fda said 
the fda said guar gum has not been demonstrated to be an 
effective weightloss ingredient the agency has been moving to ban 
the substance for this use 
use of guar gum is permitted in small amounts in foods such as 
cheese salad dressings and ice creams the fda said it poses no 
health problem when used that way 
health care products is currently under a temporary restraining 
order issued by a federal court in tampa that prohibits the company 
from selling calban 3000 by telephone or mail said jeff drucker 
an attorney in the consumer protection division of the postal 
service 
he said the order stems from a postal service action several 
years ago in which the agency alleged the company falsely 
advertised that calban was an effective weightloss product

president bush has decided against 
intervening in the planned acquisition by a japanese corporation of 
an american firm semigas systems inc that makes equipment used 
in manufacturing semiconductors the white house announced friday 
the decision follows an administration investigation of whether 
the sale of company to nippon sanso kk posed a threat to us 
security interests and drew an immediate angry response from 
executives of sematech the federally financed research consortium 
that links several important us semiconductor companies 
the parent company of semigas hercules inc of wilmington 
del in april announced its intention to sell the subidiary to 
nippon sanso for 23 million 
semigas designs assembles and installs gas systems used in 
making computer chips which must be manufactured in superclean 
environments 
weve worked with a leading american firm to develop leading 
technology and then to have that technology fall into the hands of 
a foreign competitor doesnt sit very well with us said miller 
bonner a spokesman for sematech in austin texas 
bonner said sematech also feared the sale would give the 
japanese company confidential information held by the 14 american 
computer company partners that make up the consortium 
white house deputy press secretary alixe glen said bush based 
his decision on the results of an investigation by the committee on 
foreign investment in the united states chaired by treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady 
that panel investigated national security concerns relating to 
the possible acquisition ms glen said 
the investigation was carried out under the exonflorio 
provision of the defense production act which allows the president 
to prohibit or suspend foreign acquisitions of us businesses that 
threaten national security 
if the deal goes through sematech will not allow semigas 
employees on the premises and the consortium will use every legal 
means to protect our intellectual property 
we sort of feel like were in an economic war right now he 
said 
bonner said sematech tried to block the proposed sale saying it 
would breach national security or run afoul of antitrust laws 
why would we want to develop leading world class technology 
only to sell it to a foreign competitor its very ironic that we 
get half of our funding from the department of defense and then we 
get a ruling like this he said 
the company receives about 100 million a year from the defense 
department

leukemia patient allison atlas whose 
unsuccessful quest for a perfectly matched bonemarrow donor drew 
50000 wouldbe contributors underwent tests friday for a possible 
transplant from her mother 
miss atlas 20 was admitted to the transplant floor of the fred 
hutchinson cancer research center on thursday center spokeswoman 
susan edmonds said friday 
the first step in such a transplant a week of chemotherapy and 
radiation to destroy the diseased marrow will not begin until a 
date has been set which might happen later friday edmonds said 
there have been no procedures done just some testing to 
determine miss atlas condition edmonds said 
simon atlas a cousin of miss atlas father said friday in new 
york that the chemotherapy and radiation could begin monday with 
the transplant performed early the following week 
relatives are uneasy he said but miss atlas seems to be 
pretty cool 
i spoke to her the night before shes anxious to get it done 
she wants to get on with her life atlas said she really feels 
confident its going to work its just remarkable how positive her 
attitude is 
the bethesda md woman was a student at new york university 
until she became ill last year she said last week she had decided 
to undergo a transplant of her mothers marrow while she is strong 
enough for the procedure 
arline atlass marrow matches four out of six antigens or cell 
identifiers in her daughters marrow 
with miss atlass type of leukemia doctors say there is a 60 
percent survival rate with a transplant if theres a sixantigen 
match the survival rate is even lower without a perfect match 
but without a transplant the disease is 100 percent fatal 
miss atlas is in an extremely sterile environment said edmonds 
as is the case with all bone marrow patients 
wellwishers can send cards balloons and little animals 
but she cannot receive flowers or plants said simon atlas her 
room is divided by a clear plastic curtain so she and her family 
are separated but can see each other and talk he said 
bloodproducing marrow is a key element in the bodys immune 
system and transplant recipients are extremely vulnerable to 
infection immediately after the procedure before the new marrow 
begins functioning 
a campaign launched last fall by miss atlas family and a 
support group friends of allison prompted 50000 people in the 
united states and israel to take blood tests to determine if they 
were perfect donors it also raised 3 million for processing the 
samples 
ten patients found perfectly matched donors as a result of the 
flood of new listings with the national marrow donor program but 
miss atlas was not among them 
mrs atlas had been a fallback all along simon atlas said 
earlier this week shes not a perfect match obviously or we 
would have used her at the outset 
if a perfect match is found up to the moment of transplant we 
would use it he said 
marrow from mrs atlas will be given to her daughter in a 
transfusion a procedure that takes two to three hours two to 
three weeks after the transplant doctors watch for an increase in 
white blood cells a sign that the transplant has taken 
in leukemia a form of cancer white blood cells multiply 
uncontrollably bone marrow produces blood and doctors can combat 
the cancer by replacing the diseased marrow with healthy tissue

football league cards featuring raised pictures of the players with 
braille information on the back 
the cards hold particular significance for plunkett who retired 
from the los angeles raiders in 1987

peninsula society for the blind and family service of 
midpeninsula the plunketts are active in both agencies 
the manufacturer hipro marketing plans a full 280card set of 
current players to be sold for 120 and packs of six cards for 
249 said laurie pearlstein a publicist for the collection

limited quite the collectors item 
some of the cards will be distributed to visually impaired 
children she said 
john bosworth vice president of hipro marketing said his 
company decided to try the braille cards after discovering the 
process it used to emboss the pictures could be used for braille 
type 
we jumped at the chance to make sports cards more accessible 
to the blind said bosworth we are very excited at the 
prospect of expanding production into an entire series of braille 
cards

avianca airlines announced friday it was willing 
to pay 75000 each to survivors or relatives of victims of the 
crash of flight 52 without requiring them to relinquish their 
rights to further claims 
seventythree people died and 85 were injured in the jan 25 
crash of the boeing 707 on long island during an approach to 
kennedy airport after a flight from colombia 
attorneys for the victims hailed the offer as unprecedented and 
generous 
they were smart and did what was morally correct said marc 
s moller who represents 45 of the crash victims 
this is a great humanitarian gesture said lawyer robert a 
solomon who filed a 100 million lawsuit against avianca on behalf 
of a man and his young son 
the proposal was made by an attorney for avianca george 
tompkins during a hearing before us district judge thomas c 
platt on civil lawsuits filed against the airline in the tragedy 
so far about 100 civil lawsuits have been filed against avianca 
in the crash so the offer would cost the airline at least 75 
million 
under the terms of the warsaw convention governing international 
aviation aircrash victims awards are generally limited to 
75000 unless willful misconduct by the airline is proven 
moller said that in the past airlines had paid out settlement 
money only after they had been ordered to do so by a court 
following the resolutions of often lengthy lawsuits 
moller said he would proceed with the civil lawsuits against the 
airline 
under the avianca proposal the airline also would continue to 
pay survivors medical expenses at least until the end of the year 
subtracted from the lump sum would be payments already made to 
the families 2500 to each survivor plus a 1500 monthly 
livingexpense allotment paid for the last several months 
generally solomon said payments are offered only as 
settlements in which the plaintiff agrees to drop any future legal 
action 
my client will be very pleased with this offer because they 
need the money said kenneth p nolan whose firm represents 
about two dozen families of crash victims 
he called the avianca offer generous and fair but said 
he believed many of his clients would eventually receive much more 
compensation its a good first step he said 
in addition to the action against avianca at least 12 
passengers injured in the crash have sued the federal aviation 
administration maintaining that air traffic controllers failed to 
insure a safe flight for the jetliner 
the plane crashed on a wooded hillside near cove neck ny 
about 20 miles east of new york city after running out of fuel 
under the terms of the avianca offer the us government would 
have to acknowledge that in making the payments the airline does 
not abandon its right to sue the federal government to recoup the 
payments

fuzz busters designed to help drivers spot police cars on the 
highway 
under crossexamination rodriguez said that by september 1986 
before the crash he was told the equipment had improved

the former prosecutor who first filed 
molestation charges in the mcmartin preschool case blamed district 
attorney ira reiner for fridays mistrial but reiner said the case 
was in trouble long before he took over 
there was nothing wrong with that case when it was filed 
said robert philibosian who lost his post to reiner in a 
hardfought 1984 contest reiner has to answer for that case 
philibosian called the outcome a political disaster for 
reiner whose future was already clouded by his recent primary 
election loss for state attorney general 
superior court judge stanley weisberg declared a mistrial in 
raymond buckeys molestation retrial after a jury said it was 
hopelessly deadlocked on eight sex counts involving children at the 
preschool 
the mcmartin case consumed seven years of court time and cost 
los angeles county more than 135 million making it the longest 
most expensive criminal court case in us history 
reiner decided to put an end to the case following the mistrial 
we are not going to retry this case for a third time reiner 
said nothing would be served by putting the children the 
parents and the public through this for a third time 
but reiner said he did not regret going through with the second 
trial 
it was important to see if this case was tried with dispatch 
if there would be another result he said the parents felt it 
was important there would be a resolution i think its clear now 
there cannot be 
reiner conceded however there were fundamental problems with 
the evidence in this case but contended those problems predated 
his tenure as district attorney 
he singled out the use of private therapists rather than police 
officers to interview the children who claimed they were molested 
these people were acting in good faith he said but he 
added they were not trained in criminal law and did not know that 
its necessary when you question children not to say anything 
that was leading or suggestive to the child 
the case originally featured seven defendants but reiner 
dropped charges against five defendants in 1986 for lack of 
evidence 
reiner and others criticized philibosian contending he pursued 
the mcmartin case as vigorously as he did to help himself 
politically philibosian has denied the allegation

the stepfather charged with fatally 
plunging a 2yearold headfirst into a toilet testified friday that 
he never meant to kill the child and only dangled him in the toilet 
to teach him a lesson 
murder is the wrong word to use because it wasnt 
intentional said thomas coe 23 his death was not planned 
it was an instantaneous thought 
coes testimony in his firstdegree murder and aggravated child 
abuse trial came a year from the day he dunked stepson bradley 
mcgee into the commode as punishment for soiling his pants 
i turned him upside down put his head in the commode and 
lifted him back out coe said i grabbed both feet with my 
right hand and flushed the commode holding him above the water 
bradley died of massive head injuries the next day 
earlier friday coes mother collapsed on the witness stand and 
was taken out in a stretcher after testifying that her sons wife 
sheryl mcgee coe hated bradley and was to blame for the childs 
misfortune 
mary rae coe anders testified that on one occasion she had to 
rush over to the couples trailer when her son called to say mrs 
coe had violently shaken the boy 
when mrs anders arrived she said she found coe cuddling 
bradley and his wife screaming i didnt mean to do it i didnt 
mean to do it 
after mrs anders collapse she was treated for chest pains at 
a hospital and released 
the jury was not present during mrs anders testimony and 
prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed to have it read to the 
jury without mention of the frantic courtroom scene 
coe has confessed to the dunking but his attorneys contend he 
should be convicted of a lesser offense because it was merely an 
isolated punishment in potty training and there was no malicious 
intent 
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty arguing bradleys 
death was the culmination of weeks of coes torturous abuse 
bradleys death came only two weeks after he was ordered 
returned from foster care to his mother and stepfather 
mrs coe 21 has testified that during those two months her 
husband often forced the child to pick up feces with his mouth and 
that coe ground his fist and cayenne pepper into the boys genitals 
she admitted to sometimes aiding in abuse and beating the 
toddler with pillows just before he died she pleaded no contest to 
seconddegree murder and aggravated child abuse and is serving a 
30year sentence 
medical experts have testified that bradleys body was found to 
be covered with more than 50 bruises many inflicted up to two 
weeks before his death 
youve seen the pictures of your son since the day he was 
killed prosecutor john aguero shouted pointing to hospital 
photos of bradley how hard did you have to hit him to cause 
those bruises 
i dont know the amount of force it took coe answered 
you hit him hard didnt you mr coe the prosecutor said 
i dont know coe replied 
final arguments were scheduled for monday the case was moved 
from polk county where the death occurred to fort myers because 
of intense publicity

prosecutors on friday dropped all charges against 
a student accused of publishing a computer program stolen from a 
ninestate 911 emergency network in an underground electronic 
newsletter attorneys said 
craig neidorf of chesterfield mo a member of a computer 
hacker network known as the legion of doom was assigned to a 
threeyear pretrial diversion program similar to probation said 
assistant us attorney william cook 
neidorf faced 10 counts of wire fraud receiving stolen goods 
and interstate transportation of stolen goods cook said had he 
been convicted he could have faced up to 31 years in prison and 
122000 in fines 
the 20yearold prelaw student at the university of missouri 
was indicted in february in the theft a year before of the 
atlantabased bellsouth corp computer program that controlled 911 
emergency calls to police fire ambulance and emergency services 
the program handled 911 calls in alabama mississippi georgia 
tennessee kentucky louisiana north and south carolina and 
florida 
much of the computer program that prosecutors originally 
believed was stolen was actually public property which prompted 
prosecutors to drop the charges cook said 
the case was heard in us district court in chicago because the 
newsletter was published on a computer bulletin board in lockport 
ill prosecutors said 
prosecutors said legion of doom members used their computers to 
tap into the 911 system and copy the program they then published 
the information in phrack an underground electronic newsletter 
neidorf had published since he was 16 for computer freaks and 
hackers he said 
emergency telephone service was not interrupted during or 
because of the breakin although the hackers threatened the 
networks operation when they breached its security codes cook 
said 
he was just doing this to put it into his newsletter to say 
see what i got cook said it was just for ego gratification 
an ego trip 
neidorfs attorney sheldon zenner said hes happy prosecutors 
dropped the case 
we are just grateful that the us attorneys office took the 
evidence into consideration zenner said 
when the indictments were handed down acting us attorney ira 
raphaelson called the breakin intentional and threatening 
these were not teenagers playing games raphaelson said 
they are thieves theyre reckless and theyre dangerous 
an estimated 3 billion to 5 billion is lost each year to 
computer fraud raphaelson said 
another man indicted in the february 1989 breakin robert 
riggs 20 of decatur ga pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud 
and transferring stolen goods across interstate lines cook said 
the neidorf decision will not have any effect on riggs case he 
said 
riggs is to be sentenced in us district court in georgia on 
sept 14 he faces up to 15 years in prison and 500000 in fines 
cook said

the charges came in a barebones twopage complaint and the 
state attorney generals office refused to say what new evidence it 
might have 
prosecutors claim that knapp now 44 set the nov 16 1973 fire 
that killed linda louise and iona marie knapp ages 2 and 3 while 
they slept in the family house trailer in suburban mesa 
knapps attorneys claim the fire was started either by knapps 
thenwife linda or by the children themselves 
knapp was sentenced to death in january 1975 but was freed in 
1987 by maricopa county superior court judge stephen gerst who 
ruled that new defense evidence left it unclear what or who started 
the fire 
the new charges come weeks before an election for attorney 
general and knapps attorney mark wallace said the timing seemed 
curious 
the facts speak themselves he said i think you should 
draw your own conclusions 
a spokesman for the prosecutors office cathy czagany said 
prosecutors would not discuss their evidence for fear of violating 
courtimposed rules on what lawyers may say before trial 
knapp has been living with relatives in texas and pennsylvania 
since being released he was arrested on the new charges wednesday 
night in carnegie pa and is being held without bond pending 
extradition 
knapp then a taxi driver admitted his guilt shortly after the 
fire but retracted his statement he has since maintained that he 
gave the statement because of pain from recurring migraine 
headaches 
the states expert had claimed the fire was so fast and fierce 
that it must have been fed by flammable material but knapps 
lawyers said their expert believed the trailers carpet could have 
been set alight by children playing with matches and still produced 
the same burn pattern that the states expert claimed was proof of 
an accelerant

washington ap equals sixteen months after the exxon valdez 
disaster house and senate negotiators approved legislation 
thursday raising liability limits for oil shippers and creating a 
1 billion federal fund to clean up spills immediately 
the legislation now goes to the two chambers for final approval 
supporters said they hoped it would be ready for president bushs 
signature before congress august recess 
the bill also requires the phasing out of most singlehulled oil 
tankers over the next 20 years and the creation of regional coast 
guard strike teams to improve responses to serious tanker accidents 
the tougher requirements were the direct result of the nations 
worst oil spill on march 24 1989 when the exxon valdez ran 
aground in alaskas prince william sound the spill tarnished 
hundreds of miles of shoreline shores and devastated marine life 
exxon already has spent an estimated 2 billion in cleanup 
efforts 
the legislation agreed to thursday by a housesenate conference 
committee significantly broadens liability for shippers involved in 
an oil spill raising the liability ceilings from 150 to 1200 
per gross ton 
as a result the largest supertankers would face maximum 
liabilities under federal law of more than 240 million if gross 
negligence is involved in a spill liability would be unlimited 
under the legislation 
the house and the senate had approved separate versions of the 
bill in november progress stalled for months as negotiators tried 
to resolve differences especially over the doublehull issue and 
whether to limit industry liability in line with a proposed 
international treaty 
over the last two months the conferees resolved the treaty 
issue and settled on requiring doublehull tankers for virtually 
all of the tanker fleet by the year 2010 a few tankers would be 
given an additional five years to comply 
the coast guard has estimated that if the exxon valdez had been 
double hulled much of the 11 million gallons of oil that spilled 
into prince william sound might have been contained 
with the most controversial issues resolved going into 
thursdays final meeting of the conference committee there 
remained only minor changes to be made in the bill before it was 
approved by a voice vote 
rep walter jones dnc injected some lastminute drama into 
the proceedings however when he introduced minutes before a final 
vote an amendment aimed at blocking for a time anyway plans by 
mobil corp to drill for natural gas 40 miles off the coast of 
cape hatteras nc 
the measure was attacked by oil state congressmen but won 
approval among jones house colleagues it was not opposed by the 
senate and was written into the bill jones amendment calls for no 
drilling until oct 1 1991 so a scientific panel could further 
examine the environmental impact 
this is a pure and simple moratorium declared rep ron 
marlenee rmont he said the provision would be challenged when 
the legislation goes back for final consideration in the house 
congressional sources said its doubtful that it would derail the 
bill 
the cornerstone of the legislation remains the 1 billion 
federal fund to pay for oil spill cleanups and reimburse injured 
parties for damages the oil industry since last january has been 
paying 5 cents per barrel of oil into the fund 
while the higher liability requirements and the federal fund 
vastly increases the money that would be available after a spill 
the amounts still are far below what the exxon valdez spill is 
expected to cost 2 billion for the company alone with the job 
still unfinished 
other provisions 
creation of a national oil spill response unit under the coast 
guard where computers will hold lists of personnel and equipment 
that can be called upon worldwide in response to a spill 
expanded research into developing new technology for oil 
pollution control with 225 million allocated for three pilot 
research programs in california new york and along the gulf coast 
a requirement that the federal government check driving records 
for alcoholrelated offenses before allowing anyone to operate a 
tanker the captain of the exxon valdez had a history of 
alcoholrelated driving offenses and was accused of drinking before 
the alaska spill 
at the request of alaskas congressional delegation the bill 
would bar any tanker involved in an oil spill of more than 1 
million gallons from ever entering prince william sound 
alaska gov steve cowper praised the agreement saying 
congress is on the eve of charting a new course of environmental 
protection for the country congress should pass it as soon as 
possible to head off another disaster like the exxon valdez

the irish government protested thursday 
to britain over british marines boarding and searching of prime 
minister charles haugheys private yacht this week the marines 
were based in northern ireland 
haughey was not on the 40foot yacht celtic mist when the 
boarding occurred sunday but his three sons were 
the incident took place in carlingford lough waterway separating 
county down in the british province of northern ireland and county 
louth in the republic of ireland the boundary between northern 
ireland and the irish republic which lays formal constitutional 
claim to northern ireland and its territorial waters runs down the 
middle of the waterway but belfast and dublin dispute its exact 
location 
news reports quoted the skipper businessman brian stafford and 
a haughey son as saying the yacht was in irish republic waters on 
the south side of the waterway at the time 
british army headquarters in northern ireland said in a 
statement thursday the yacht was in northern ireland waters 
irish news reports said haughey was not exactly pleased over 
the incident 
the irish coastal patrol vessel orla carrying a 76mm gun and 
machine guns arrived in carlingford lough on tuesday ostensibly 
on fishery protection duties british news reports claimed dublin 
sent the vessel to show the flag 
the irish department of foreign affairs formally protested 
thursday to the british governments northern ireland office in 
belfast over the incident 
reports conflicted as to what happened when the royal marine 
patrol boarded the yacht some irish news reports said the marines 
abused stafford and others aboard even when told who the owner was 
and there was an exchange of insults 
the british army statement said stafford made no objection to 
the marines request to board and signed customary boarding forms 
it said the search was part of routine operations to deter irish 
republican army guerrillas from smuggling weapons by sea into 
northern ireland and that the yacht was not brought to a halt 
during the search 
it said the marines insulted no one and that they thanked and 
saluted stafford before leaving on their own vessel 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting british rule in 
northern ireland it wants to unite the protestantdominated 
province with the 95 percent catholic republic of ireland under 
socialist rule 
haughey was back aboard the yacht on thursday the vessel is 
cruising off county donegal in the northwest of the republic of 
ireland on the other side of the island of ireland from 
carlingford lough

a former playboy model was sentenced thursday 
to 10 months in prison for evading taxes on 686000 that an aging 
millionaire paid her during a fiveyear sexual relationship with 
the model and her sister 
lynnette harris 35 was convicted of tax evasion in may by a 
federal jury that did not accept her claims the money represented 
taxfree gifts 
ms harris and her identical blond sister leigh ann conley 
received a total of 11 million through june 1987 from david 
kritzik of suburban shorewood who died last summer at age 89 
ms conley was convicted in june of four misdemeanor counts of 
failing to file tax returns on her share of kritziks generosity 
she was to be sentenced aug 29 
judge thomas curran sentenced ms harris to 10 months in prison 
plus two months in a halfway house and fined her 12500 harris 
said afterward she intends to appeal 
i got involved in this relationship and it has turned out to 
be a nightmare to say the least she said 
us attorney mel johnson argued ms harris did not accept 
responsibility for the crimes during the trial 
this is not a situation where ms harris had a momentary lapse 
of judgement it is something she did over a period of four tax 
years johnson said 
curran accepted a recommendation from defense attorney dennis 
coffey and allowed her a sentence reduction usually reserved for 
defendants who plead guilty ms harris had faced up to 12 years in 
prison 
i am convinced that unlike most tax cases the defendant did 
not start out with tax evasion in mind curran said she didnt 
devise some sophisticated scheme to evade taxes 
ms harris and ms conley appeared nude in playboy magazine and 
in two films i the jury and sorceress before becoming two 
of the five young women the government said befriended kritzik 
kritzik founded general merchandise co in the 1930s the 
company became one of the largest mail order companies in the 
world kritzik also founded the treasure island discount store 
chain as a division of general merchandise 
he sold the firm to jc penney co in 1962 for 11 million

roger welsch loves stories 
he writes them on bar napkins he tells them with great skill 
he remembers them even if he forgets almost everything else 
i cant remember your name he said recently with some 
embarrassment but if you told me a story right now i would 
remember the story 
welschs stories which deal with the humor and wisdom found in 
smalltown america are featured on sunday morning the cbs 
program hosted by charles kuralt his twoyear contract was 
recently renewed and viewers are assured of at least eight of 
welschs postcards from nebraska each year 
before cbs he taught folklore and literature not your typical 
buttoneddown academician he sported a long ponytail with a 
feather tied in it eventually he left his tenured position at the 
university of nebraskalincoln for life in this village of 380 
people 
that decision came slowly and with some fear welsch said hed 
worked for tenure all his life he was married and had a daughter 
but he had purchased 60 acres and he wanted his child antonia 
to grow up in the country he also needed the open spaces and 
quieter lifestyle 
i loved the people and the river and the land said welsch 
53 it was time to move 
welsch moved to dannebrog from lincoln in 1987 when he took a 
leave of absence he resigned his teaching position the next year 
he hoped to earn a living speaking at banquets writing for 
magazines and a weekly column for 13 nebraska newspapers but the 
ends werent meeting 
i told my wife linda ive got bad news and ive got worse 
news welsch recalled the bad news is were not making it 
the worse news is im not going back 
about two months later fortune and charles kuralt stepped in 
welsch had done several pieces over the years for kuralts show 
the avuncular newsman was sitting in the audience one night as 
welsch spoke at a west point chamber of commerce banquet 
he came very quietly in the back of the room and asked if 
welsch would like to join the show 
the program gave welsch the financial security he needed 
it also made him a tv star and made this central nebraska town 
on the edge of the semiarid sandhills famous around the country 
many in this town with one main street one bar a restaurant a 
drivein and two gas stations enjoy the newfound fame others 
dont 
hes just a big blowhard said charles fox 75 whose wife 
lucile runs an antique store in town 
fox said some people who travel to dannebrog are disappointed 
there isnt more to see fox also said he was described in one of 
welschs articles as the surliest and cheapest guy in howard 
county 
welsch for the record denies he had fox in mind when he wrote 
the piece 
several in town said welschs penchant for overalls and folksy 
humor might make dannebrog appear like a town of rubes 
on rogers program you guys look like hicks carol 
schroeders sister told her 
well we are ms schroeder said 
its made us able to laugh at ourselves she said 
welsch said he feels nothing but respect for his neighbors he 
plans to air smalltown opinions on major political issues such as 
protecting the american flag from desecration with a constitutional 
amendment 
a friend eric said that if you tried to burn a flag on the 
main street of dannebrog the first thing theyd do is call the fire 
department what they see is not the symbol they see a fire 
welsch said 
many in town are thankful for welschs influence he helped the 
dannebrog area booster club make contacts that led to state 
financial aid as the town worked to establish itself as the 
danish capital of nebraska said shirley johnson a member of 
the club 
on a nationwide tour for his new book its not the end of the 
earth but you can see it from here welsch talked about the town 
at every stop and passed out brochures mrs johnson said 
the other day three ladies were traveling from washington 
state to washington dc and they planned their trip by way of 
dannebrog because theyd seen him on tv said mayor gene hartman 
who runs the dan dee drivein and restaurant 
hartman doesnt think welschs tales hurt nebraskas image 
if you take this as roger has meant it to be a fun thing 
then its a fun thing to do hartman said 
 
elsewhere in television 
you bite up my life at last tv with bite but not until sept 
24 thats when the syndicated dracula the series will 
premiere in 115 cities in addition to being the usual pain in the 
neck this new dracula is a european billionaire seeking global 
domination his dark secret is discovered by two teenaged american 
lads geordie johnson plays dracula it is not known if hell tell

crime has tripled muggers walk 
free anger grows in tandem with fear and horacio santos who 
chased down and killed two thieves because he couldnt take any 
more has become the symbol of it all 
the santos case jarred many of the 10 million people in buenos 
aires who felt safe in their city until the last few years 
historians sociologists judges police government officials 
newspaper vendors and nearly everyone else express opinions about 
the case at cocktail parties in letters to editors on street 
corners and radio talk shows 
one saturday morning in june santos a 42yearold engineer 
heard glass breaking outside and recognized the sound of his car 
alarm he rushed to a window and saw two men laughing walk off to 
their own car with his tape deck 
santos home had been burglarized twice and thieves had broken 
into his car 14 times overwhelmed by anger he gave chase 
when santos caught up to the thieves on the road he shot one in 
the head and the other in the throat two bullets two men dead 
he was arrested on homicide charges and confined in a hospital 
for psychiatric tests his wife norma said i cant believe 
what happened horacio cant either this is a nightmare 
on thursday judge luis cevasco ruled that santos was 
nonindictable because he acted while in a state of emotional 
distress 
the men santos killed were not career criminals one was a 
31yearold bus driver and the other 29 worked in a butcher shop 
both had wives and children 
as argentinas economic recession has shrunk real wages and 
increased unemployment more people have turned to crime 
did horacio santos do the right thing 
i would have done the same may god forgive me said 
bernardo neustadt argentinas most popular news commentator 
mariano grondona host of the television program key hour 
said about 99 percent of the calls to my program were in favor 
of santos reaction 
jorge luis passero chief of the federal police said santos 
cant be taken as an example for others because that would be 
going back to the law of the jungle 
robbery and assault have become commonplace in buenos aires 
crimes like rape and murder are relatively rare but some highly 
publicized cases of violence make people feel vulnerable 
on june 14 two days before the santos shooting a businessman 
who had identified a mugger in a police lineup was shot and killed 
after the alleged assailant was released 
two months ago men brandishing a machine gun tried to force 
investment broker esteban reynal off the main highway north of the 
city as he drove to his weekend home he accelerated and outran 
them 
earlier this year a judges home was bombed and gunmen shot up 
the car of another the second magistrate luis cevasco blamed 
parapolice groups that were trying to influence cases 
the worst thing is that its not just criminals but also the 
forces of security who commit crimes said reynal who recognized 
one of his assailants in the police station where he reported the 
shooting the provincial policeman was arrested 
this month three policemen who offered to free a jailed person 
in exchange for a computer were sentenced to jail a judge has been 
accused of trying to extort 500000 from a medical clinic in 
return for dropping charges the clinic claims he fabricated 
corruption is a serious problem among police officers who are 
paid the equivalent of only 100 a month and usually have second 
jobs 
according to official statistics the number of crimes in buenos 
aires province was 122000 last year compared with 47000 in 1985 
argentines are increasingly careful about what they wear where 
they go and how they get there 
months ago santos and his neighbors organized teams to watch 
homes and cars private security guards patrol wealthy communities 
residents in the zone of weekend homes and country clubs along 
the river plate are buying guard dogs electric gates and handguns 
and chipping in to provide the police with better cars and 
equipment 
buenos aires province has announced plans to transfer more 
officers to street duty and hire 2000 new ones 
police acknowledge crime is increasing but claim it isnt out 
of control most of the offenses are muggings and thefts from cars 
and homes street gangs and drug peddling like major violent 
crimes are uncommon 
chief passero said in an interview that the conviction rate is 
low because of reforms in the penal code made in 1984 when 
civilian democracy returned after nearly eight years of military 
dictatorship 
each 100 arrests result in only 26 convictions and half of 
those get off without jail terms he said 
passero said police should be allowed to hold more suspects 
until trial and judges should give harsher sentences 
the santos case brought fears into the open like bernard goetz 
did in new york city in december 1984 when he shot four youths he 
thought were going to rob him on a subway train 
the weekly news magazine somos ran a cover story called the 
santos case fear and rage gente published a photo of a santos 
bearded and smiling over the words assassin or vigilante 
noticias featured a bullet and the headline justice under fire

opponents of a capital gains tax cut generally 
defend their position by contending that the biggest beneficiaries 
would be the welltodo who can well afford to pay 
while that might or might not be true statistical wizardry can 
be used to support or deny the contention it has been a rather 
safe and popular position to take most people do not think of 
themselves as welloff 
now however the debate could move into an area where 
sensitivities are much more alive the elderly says the national 
center for policy analysis are hit hardest by capital gains taxes 
suddenly the number of direct participants in the debate has 
grown to say nothing of the level of their feelings many people 
aspire to being welloff but almost everyone on earth aspires to 
staying on it as long as possible 
the longer your stay the center points out the longer any 
capital investment you might have such as in stocks will be 
diluted by inflation yes the law treats inflationary gains as if 
they are real ones taxable ones 
it means that if in your old age you finally sell your stock 
investment youll be accorded no special treatment because value 
was lost to inflation no you will be taxed on that inflation 
when you can least afford it 
this is just one of the points made by the center a 
dallasbased research institute which describes itself as 
nonprofit and nonpartisan though some of its recent papers 
suggest that older folks are deserving of more respect 
the tax code discriminates against the elderly declares 
john goodman president he says that tax reform a la 1986 was 
great for most young people but that it contained hidden 
surprises for the elderly 
in that year the tax on longterm capital gains was raised to 
the same level as that of ordinary income thus eliminating what 
had been a capital gains tax advantage 
goodman points out that most income earned by the young is from 
wages and salaries but much of the income earned by the elderly is 
from capital investments it means he says that the elderly got a 
sudden tax increase 
it couldnt have come at a more unfortunate time for them he 
says often retired they could not raise their incomes to offset 
the bigger tax load nor could they obtain costofliving 
increases as did many working people 
some social security recipients says goodman are taxed at an 
effective rate of 42 percent compared with 28 percent for younger 
people he arrives at that number in this manner 
for every dollar of income earned beyond a certain point many 
elderly lose 50 cents of every 1 of social security it means 
taxpayers who receive an additional 1 of income may pay taxes not 
just on that 1 but on 150 instead 
the centers paper states that one in three taxpayers over the 
age of 65 years has a capital gain each year compared with only 9 
percent of the younger taxpayers so many social security 
recipients exceed the limitations 
it isnt just the elderly who are being hurt says goodman much 
of the incentive to save among younger people is gone he says 
who he asks wants to invest for years and years only to have 
it taxed away when they are older and least able to afford it

almost two years after the government sharply 
reined in economic reforms to curb inflation it again is touting 
the advantages of a capitalist mainstay shareholding 
recent reports indicate economic planners view stock ownership 
of companies as a way to relieve the growing government burden of 
keeping ailing state enterprises afloat 
chinas industrial companies will eventually shift toward the 
shareholding system in which the state will serve as the major 
shareholder zheng hongqing a top economist in the state 
commission for restructuring the economy told wednesdays china 
daily 
rather than meddling in management the government should be 
made a shareholder in state industrial firms zheng told the 
official newspaper 
zhengs comments echoed those of several liberal economists who 
recently reappeared in the chinese press after months of absence 
following a government crackdown on dissent last june the 
crackdown also criticized marketoriented reforms of chinas 
socialist economy 
following the suppression of prodemocracy protests in which 
hundreds of civilians died talk of establishing securities markets 
faded 
an economic austerity program that was reinforced following the 
crackdown succeeded in reducing inflation to its lowest level in 
five years but it also left many businesses short of cash and 
unable to buy raw materials forcing many into bankruptcy 
the government has found itself in a double bind as it seeks to 
keep growing numbers of debtridden state enterprises afloat while 
relying on shrinking tax revenues 
the central governments treasury has had a hard time to 
support an everexpanding budget and help to keep some industrial 
firms from going bankrupt the china daily report said 
a prominent liberal economist li yining said in a recent 
economic daily report that the only way for china to extract itself 
from its financial morass would be through establishing securities 
markets 
only through a securities market where ailing enterprises are 
sold to successful ones could enterprise groups be established in 
a real sense said li a beijing university professor 
li said stock markets could provide a ready source of investment 
funds through the sale of stocks and bonds while absorbing and 
putting to productive use the growing reservoir of personal savings 
in turn securities markets would generate profits both to the 
state and other shareholders he wrote in the economic daily 
we believe that the development of securities markets is not 
only a financial remedy but also a way to stabilize the economy 
from a longterm viewpoint wang poming vice president of the 
beijingbased stock exchange executive council recently told the 
china daily 
the reports have energized chinas fledgling stock markets 
especially in shanghai where stock prices jumped 7 percent tuesday 
and wednesday as investors flooded the market 
so far there has been little specific mention of what sort of 
trading would be allowed under a widescale stock ownership system 
chinas financial markets now are highly restrictive 
speculative dealing is not allowed and limited mostly to state 
bonds used to raise money for the national budget few companies 
are allowed to issue shares except to employees 
the largest bourse is in shanghai which had one of asias 
biggest stock markets before the 1949 communist takeover official 
sources say 12 million residents have invested in stocks and bonds 
worth 53078 million in its market which mainly deals in 
government bonds 
total trade volume for all chinas stock exchanges is expected 
to reach 148 billion this year up from 48832 million last 
year according to official reports

general electric co still faces a possible 
ban on defense contracts after paying 30 million in fines and 
civil settlements for overcharging the army for a battlefield 
computer system and other claims 
ge the nations secondlargest defense contractor with 6 
billion in government business was fined 10 million on monday in 
the case 
us district judge lowell reed jr also sentenced two employees 
of a ge subsidiary to prison for their roles in the scheme 
ge also announced it would pay 83 million to settle a civil 
suit stemming from the case and another 117 million in unrelated 
civil charges involving defense contracts 
the penalties may not be over however as the government mulls 
a ban on defense contracts 
before we can make that determination we would have to review 
the sentencing the settlement agreement plus matters that general 
electric would present for consideration said army spokesman 
maj pete keating 
in a statement issued by ge the company said it was pleased the 
government recognized the steps it had taken to thwart recurrence 
of fraud 
its time to close the book on this old case the company 
said 
assistant us attorney nicholas harbist said ge had developed 
selfpolicing and disclosure safeguards to prevent similar fraud in 
the future and declared their decade of deceit as government 
contractors has ended 
in 1985 the company pleaded guilty to illegally claiming cost 
overruns on minuteman missiles and paid a 104 million fine it 
was banned then for three three weeks overall and six months at 
the division where the violations occurred 
the 10 million fine was the secondlargest criminal fine in a 
defense contracting case the government said northrop corp 
agreed to pay a 17 million fine in february for falsifying records 
on parts for the cruise missile and harrier jet 
this is a sad commentary on the corporate character of general 
electric at the time of the fraud 198284 said us district 
judge lowell reed jr 
the case arose from a 246 million contract with the ge 
subsidiary management amp technical services co to make a computer 
system to monitor supplies in the field 
the company was convicted of not telling the defense department 
when it found subcontractors who would make parts at significant 
savings 
one employee gerald a leo 52 of king of prussia was 
sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined 15000 leo the former 
materials manager at the subsidiary was convicted of four counts 
of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive investigators 
james badolato 43 of springfield was convicted of one count 
of obstructing justice and one count of trying to deceive 
investigators he was sentenced to five months in prison and fined 
10000 
this was not a oneshot deal harbist told the judge this 
was a protracted and calculated effort to steal from the department 
of defense 
he said the men were in a corporate cocoon feeling 
insulated and not responsible 
the judge said both men have not accepted responsibility for 
their actions he said badolato had a corporate mentality that 
he felt shields him somehow from responsiblity 
they cannot make the claim that they are merely acting on 
behalf of the company the judge said 
leos wife mary sobbed as her husband was sentenced then 
called out he never did anything she left the courtroom at 
the judges suggestion 
badolato was convicted of misleading investigators and 
submitting false documents in a coverup 
estimates from both sides of how much money the government lost 
ranged from 25 million to 8 million 
the government and ge submitted a joint memorandum to the judge 
recommending the 10 million fine the judge said he 
independently concluded that a 10 million fine was adequate 
fair and in the best interest of the public 
the 83 million civil settlement certainly repays the 
government for what was lost plus the costs of the 
investigation said first assistant us attorney michael j 
rotko 
that settlement plus the 117 to settle unrelated civil 
actions was an important factor favoring the recommended 
sentence the joint memo said as part of the agreement ge 
waived its right to appeal the conviction 
the two men work at other ge divisions but have been barred from 
government contract work 
leos attorney seymour toll called his client a decent 
respected man who saw his 25year career in government 
contracting work obliterated he maintained leo was not aware of 
requirements to tell the government when savings were made in 
subcontracting 
badolatos attorney gregory miller argued that his client 
did not participate in or further the scheme and altered 
documents out of loyalty the judge told badolato your 
conduct was important to the scheme to defraud

after decades of business as usual the 
joint venture between chemical giant dupont and industry leader 
merck is the latest shakeup in an industry undergoing rapid change 
worldwide 
drug companies largely sat out the mergermad 1980s the 
industrys first major deal was in 1988 between two small danish 
firms novo and norodisk smithklinebeechman corp and marion 
merrell dow inc merged a short time later 
acquisitions became popular of late also ah robins was 
acquired by american home products corp hoffmannla roche 
acquired 60 percent of genentech and sterling drug co was bought 
by the film giant eastman kodak co 
there are other ways to work together without getting 
married said stuart levine of gruntal amp co who pointed to 
copromotion and codevelopment of products 
thats how merck and dupont got acquainted in october when 
merck obtained the rights to share in the development of a drug to 
reduce high blood pressure that dupont had originally patented 
that got the working relationship going said fred siemer 
an analyst who follows dupont for the chemical research inc 
the joint venture was planned with the longterm in mind 
according to p roy vagelos chief executive officer of merck the 
new companys research and development efforts are not expected to 
produce significant commercial results until the late 1990s 
like the merckdupont deal many of the recent mergers and 
acquisitions in the drug business have been driven at least partly 
by a desire to keep down research and development costs while 
gaining access to more markets 
wall street greeted the joint venture that was announced after 
the market closed wednesday dupont stock closed thursday at 40 
up 1 and merck closed at 89 up 
the dupont merck pharmaceuticals co will have a research and 
development staff of 1500 a sales staff of 600 and will spend 
230 million on research and development in its first year of 
existence 
dupont chipped in its entire pharmaceutical division while 
merck provides its research and development expertise marketing 
rights to several of its prescription medicines and cash and 
development funds 
analysts point to skyrocketing research and development costs 
when explaining all the activity in a field that had seen slow 
corporate change in the previous 30 years 
it takes a long time to invent your way into this business 
and its expensive siemer said 
the average cost of development of a drug from the time we 
set up a project to the time it comes out on the market is 230 
million vagelos said 
and levine pointed out that it once took from four to six years 
to develop a drug 
youre now looking at 12 or more years before bringing a drug 
to market he said 
it was duponts brisk rampd performance that attracted merck 
after dupont beat out merck and other firms in developing a new 
drug for high blood pressure company officials say 
and after spending all that time and money competition from 
generic drugs cut into sales once patents expire while pending 
patents provide a monopoly and a lock on profits 
generic competition comes on very rapidly once a patent 
expires said vagelos 
generics are often promoted by governments seeking to cut costs 
in health care programs medicare for example reimburses 
hospitals for the price of generic drugs unless a brand name drug 
is specifically prescribed 
after years of clinical studies and the fda process you might 
have only five years left on a 17year patent levine said 
long approval periods also pushed american firms to think 
globally since drugs are often approved overseas before they get 
approval in the united states according to jane belcher of duff amp 
phelps in chicago 
an international sales force becomes critical which is why 
delawarebased dupont pointed to mercks vast international sales 
staff as one reason for hooking up with its new jersey neighbor 
you need to need to introduce the new drug into all the 
major markets of the world simultaneously vagelos said 
the time of exclusivity is limited by patent and competition 
analysts expect more competitors to become allies or partners in 
this highly fragmented field no one player has more than 4 percent 
market share in this 100 billion industry 
but a bullish vagelos predicted that merck will grasp a 
doubledigit world market share by the decades end

allied stores corp has received federal 
bankruptcy court approval of a unique borrowing arrangement to help 
the retailer continue operations through its chapter 11 
reorganization 
lawyers for allied said thursday the arrangement is a first in 
chapter 11 cases because it allows the company to obtain loan funds 
by selling shortterm corporate bonds on the market probably 
incurring lower interest rates than by borrowing from banks 
allied estimates the arrangement could save the company 10 
million a year in interest company lawyer david s kurtz told us 
bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr 
the arrangement permits the company to borrow up to 630 
million which could be increased to 700 million if needed it is 
backed by the value of merchandise allied purchases with the 
borrowed funds and by a 105 million letter of credit from the 
french bank societe generale kurtz said 
we view this transaction as a major step forward in the 
reorganization and as a major achievement kurtz said 
kurtz said the arrangement also backed by chemical banking 
corp will last through may 1993 or if it occurs earlier the 
confirmation date of allieds financial reorganization plan which 
is yet to be filed the borrowing would permit allied to buy 
merchandise for its 126 stores in 17 states operated by its four 
merchandising divisions the bon inc jordan marsh stores corp 
sterns inc and maas inc 
the borrowing line replaces a 700 million credit line allied 
had obtained through citibank which was to expire july 31 kurtz 
said arrangements for the new credit would be concluded at a 
closing today in new york on monday allied will draw 386 million 
from the new borrowing line to pay off citibank kurtz said 
no creditors objected to the arrangement 
aug also approved a request by allied and its sister 
corporation federated department stores inc to allow federated 
to continue providing credit collection and related services to 
allied stores credit corp allieds credit arm 
federated and allied stores corp both owned by torontos 
campeau corp filed chapter 11 reorganization petitions jan 15 
they listed more than 7 billion in debt much of it acquired in 
campeaus leveraged deals to buy the two companies 
federated operates 129 stores in 19 states federated and allied

three commodities traders facing charges of fraud 
and racketeering that left a jury deadlocked in the original trial 
will be retried march 5 a federal judge says 
us district judge ann c williams ordered the retrial on 
thursday 
assistant us attorney mark pollack said the government would 
retool the indictments against floor broker robert mosky and 
independent traders danny scheck and david zatz all of whom traded 
swiss franc futures on the floor of the chicago mercantile exchange 
defense lawyers said they would seek to have the charges 
dismissed 
mosky and scheck were convicted july 9 of relatively minor 
charges of trading violations in the first trial stemming from an 
unprecedented undercover fbi probe of corruption at the merc and 
the chicago board of trade the worlds two biggest futures 
exchanges 
the jury acquitted zatz on two fraud charges but was unable to 
reach verdicts on scores of other counts including a racketeering 
conspiracy charge against mosky 
the outcome of the twomonth trial was widely perceived as a 
victory for the defense 
the government claims the three conspired to cheat customers 
while executing their orders in the mercs swiss franc futures 
trading pit 
williams said she would withhold sentencing of the three until 
after the retrial 
trials are scheduled in september for two other groups of 
commodities traders charged in connection with the same 
investigation

microsoft corp riding a red hot hit 
with its windows 30 software plans to invest millions of dollars 
on new products and services and add more than 2300 employees in 
the next year its executives say 
corporate officials also told financial analysts gathered at 
microsofts headquarters thursday that because of the spending it 
would be difficult to maintain the hectic pace of sales growth the 
company has enjoyed 
microsoft founder and chairman bill gates said the new version 
of windows is the center of the universe for us now the 
program which provides an easytouse framework for running 
spreadsheets word processors and other programs will be further 
improved this year and have more programs adapted to it he said 
gates also said microsoft was beginning a major move into office 
computer networks and hoped to capture a share of that market now 
dominated by novell inc of orem utah 
microsoft the worlds largest publisher of personal computer 
software reported wednesday its profits for the fiscal year ended 
june 30 grew 64 percent over the year before while revenues rose 
47 percent 
were extremely bullish on the markets we participate in from 
a longterm standpoint said microsoft president mike hallman 
but added that projects would require some heavy investments this 
year 
asked whether microsoft could sustain the 47 percent sales 
growth senior vice president and chief financial officer frank 
gaudette replied i think that would be on the very high end 
microsofts stock which closed up 2 at 7150 a share 
wednesday in overthecounter trading fell 275 a share to 6875 
thursday 
neither hallman nor gates would say how much investment would be 
required but steve ballmer senior vice president for systems 
software said his segment alone would spend 18 million and hire 
500 more people to work on its new network specialist program 
microsoft spent 180 million on research and development and 
317 million on sales and marketing in fiscal 1990 
microsoft plans to grow from its present 5635 employees to 
about 8000 over the next year hallman said the new workers would 
include 750 in research and development and 1250 in sales and 
marketing 
microsoft founded by the multibillionaire gates and prep school 
friend paul allen 15 years ago had just 1800 employees in 1987 
it reported fiscal 1990 profits of 2792 million or 234 a 
share on revenues of 118 billion both records net earnings for 
fiscal 1989 were 1705 million or 4152 a share on revenues of 
8035 million 
sales and profits were boosted by windows 30 a runaway success 
with 800000 copies shipped since its introduction in late may 
ballmer said the software replaces the technical word commands 
needed to manage programs and information in ibm personal computers 
with onscreen graphics 
it is absolutely red hot ballmer said 
microsoft shipped just 200000 copies of its advanced computer 
operating system os2 in all of fiscal 1990 ballmer said 
at one time os2 was seen as the replacement for msdos 
microsofts operating system that is the industry standard for 
ibmcompatible computers but with the huge success of windows 
microsoft now sees itself as having a family of operating 
systems with os2 an advanced form of windows gates said 
dos is not likely to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
ballmer said 
in the 1990s microsoft will evangelize for office and corporate 
networks linking large computers and desktop computer users to 
permit instant access to vast amounts of information ballmer said 
to do that microsoft will introduce a new version of its local 
area network manager software in august is setting up a specially 
trained group of resellers and is boosting its sales and support 
force he said it plans a major ad campaign and a series of 
seminars this fall and winter to launch the network specialist 
program he added 
the target is novell which has 65 percent or better of the 
existing office network market novell founded in 1983 and the 
maker of the netware operating system had sales of 2259 million 
in the six months ended april 28 
capturing market share from novell wont happen soon ballmer 
said we cannot overwhelm them we have to show cleverness he 
said 
gates said he didnt see the move as dramatic or dangerous but 
necessary since he believes networks will eventually dominate 
office computing 
a novell official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
move by microsoft had been expected for some time by educating 
more potential customers microsofts heavy promotion of office 
networks should benefit the industry as a whole novell included 
the official said

management committee and son of the tycoon said the purchase is 
part of the groups efforts to diversify its investments beyond 
hong kongs shores 
we look at this investment as a window into corporate america 
and into further investment opportunities he said 
local securities analysts expressed surprise at the investment 
li kashings extraordinarily successful investment career has been 
built largely on real estate not stocks and bonds but the move 
fits with a strategy he disclosed in a newspaper interview last 
november in which he expressed his desire to reduce his exposure in 
the colony where 90 percent of his assets were parked 
many in hong kong are increasingly afraid that communist china 
will break its promise to maintain hong kongs freewheeling 
economic and political system for 50 years after it takes control 
in 1997 
this really comes as a surprise said peter lui an analyst 
at county natwest securities asia ltd but if you believe us 
interest rates will fall its probably a very good investment 
numerous hong kongbased companies are moving assets abroad in 
an attempt to reduce their risk in the colony the huge trading 
house jardine matheson has moved its base to bermuda while other 
firms have purchased property in the united states canada and 
australia 
in 1987 lis business empire purchased a 43 percent stake in 
husky oil ltd canadas largest oil and gas company 
in the current deal cheung kong a realestate giant and 
hutchison one of the colonys major trading houses will each own 
20 percent of gordon america lp a company owned by lis family 
will hold 10 percent with the remainder held by gordon investment 
under the terms of the gordon investment transaction gordon 
america agreed to pay 3 billion for the junk bonds but with 90 
percent financing on a nonrecourse basis that means the 
partnership can drop the portfolio if its losses exceed 10 percent 
and the savings and loan would have to accept it back 
us regulators and legislators could possibly oppose the sale 
of the bonds to gordon however because the government could wind 
up holding columbias bonds if the market deteriorates again

the slump in junk bond prices may have signaled 
an end to the corporate raiding of the 1980s but has given birth 
to a new breed of raider for the 1990s the bondmailer 
these investors seek out companies that have trouble making 
junkbond payments which depresses the value of the bonds the 
investors buy up a large chunk of the companys debt usually at a 
steep discount from face value 
then they offer management a choice either buy back the 
securities or face an involuntary bankruptcy petition 
a successful bondmailer chooses companies with bonds so 
undervalued in the market theyll return a profit even in a chapter 
11 bankruptcy reorganization once in bankruptcy court the 
bondmailers securities can bring cash or more likely equity in 
the company 
well see more and more of this in the 90s said c richard 
lehmann president of bond investors association inc a nonprofit 
miamibased firm that tracks bond defaults many companies will 
change hands through bond defaults and the substitution of credit 
instruments with stock 
the collapse of the junk bond market has left many companies 
struggling to make interest payments many of these highrisk 
securities feature whats known as a reset to make bondholders 
feel safer about their investment under a reset clause the bond 
issuer promises to raise the interest rate on the bond to increase 
its market value to par or face value 
with bond prices so depressed heavily indebted companies are 
faced with placing huge sometimes debilitating interest rates on 
their bonds some have to default on the issues 
in the first six months of the year the bond investors 
association recorded 40 bond defaults worth more than 11 billion 
that makes good hunting for a bondmailer 
earlier this year sci television inc avoided an involuntary 
bankruptcy petition filed by bond investor sn phelps amp co of 
greenwich conn the agreement gave 39 percent of the company to 
phelps and the other bondholders bank lenders got a 5 percent 
stake 
george gillett who had been controlling investor saw his stake 
drop from 55 percent to 41 percent kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
which created sci through a debtfinanced takeover of storer 
communications in 1985 saw its interest drop from 45 percent to 15 
percent 
with the likelihood that bondholders will see their securities 
turn into stock through negotiations with management lehmann said 
chapter 11 filings could set off bidding wars 
the strategy is in some ways analogous to the greenmailers of 
the 1980s who bought large stakes of a companys stock then made 
nuisances of themselves by forcing restructurings or theatening 
takeovers until management gave them a profit for their stock 
not surprisingly the bondmailer label for the new form of 
raider is appearing to stick some have suggested the term 
vulture capitalist 
despite their pejorative nicknames these investors arent so bad 
in lehmanns eyes 
the trend were seeing is companies are squeezing bondholders 
by buying back bonds at a discount he said this keeps them 
honest besides even if a company capitulates to a bondmailers 
demands for a hefty profit on the debt the company is still 
retiring the bonds usually well below par 
by forcing a retirement of debt at a better price for 
bondholders the bondmailers are preempting what management 
itself should be doing lehmann said 
stanford phelps owner of phelps amp co has won widespread 
recognition in the popular press as a bondmailer by virtue of the 
current cover story in forbes magazine others however are hard at 
work also 
new yorkbased japonica partners for example is pressuring 
pittsbughbased appliance maker allegheny international 
if bond defaults and an undervalued junk bond market continue 
expect to see more of the bondmailers in the coming years

senior agriculture officials from the 
european community japan canada australia and the united states 
meet next week to discuss disputes over agriculture that are 
hampering international talks to liberalize world trade the ec 
commission said friday 
but ec sources stressed the meeting in dublin was not designed 
to end a deadlock in the global trade talks over government 
assistance to producers and exporters of farm goods 
this cannot substitute for the talks within the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade said one official the meeting is 
an occasion for certain major gatt players to exchange views 
that is extremely useful 
the threeday meeting which starts monday has been called by 
ec agriculture commissioner ray macsharry 
our agenda will deal with agricultural policies international 
agricultural trade rural development and eastern europe he said 
in a statement here 
in addition to macsharry others expected at the meeting are 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter japanese agriculture 
minister tomio yamamoto australian agriculture minister john 
kerins and canadian agriculture minister donald mazankowski 
through the gatt 105 nations are negotiating for more 
liberalized global trade the talks began in 1986 and are to end in 
december although it remains questionable if an overall accord can 
be reached by then 
the key disputes in the talks that cover 15 areas of trade touch 
notably on agriculture the united states and others want the ec to 
end its system of export credits and slash direct subsidies for 
farmers 
on thursday gatt directorgeneral arthur dunkel expressed his

the us economy continuing to skirt along 
the edges of a recession posted weak growth at an annual rate of 
just 12 percent from april through june the government reported 
today 
the commerce department said that the gross national product 
the countrys total output of goods and services was propped up 
entirely in the second quarter by a big buildup in business 
inventories 
other major components of the economy from consumer spending to 
business investment and housing construction suffered declines 
during the quarter 
the 12 percent gnp increase in the second quarter followed a 
revised 17 percent increase in the first quarter and a barely 
discernible 03 percent advance in the octoberdecember period last 
year 
this string of weak quarterly growth rates is raising concerns 
over whether the current economic expansion which has lasted a 
peacetime record of almost eight years is in danger of toppling 
into a recession 
todays report offered little comfort on that score given the 
fact that the only strength came in the restocking of store shelves 
and backlots 
in the face offalling consumer demand those higher inventories 
could force production cutbacks and job layoffs in the second half 
of the year one of the classic ways a recession begins 
in one encouraging sign inflation slowed markedly in the second 
quarter with a gnp price measure dropping to an annual rate of 
increase of 39 percent down from a 66 percent rate in the first 
three months of the year onehalf of the improvement came from a 
slowing in food prices 
the bush administration is counting on the federal reserve to 
come to the economys rescue by switching its attention from 
fighting inflation to worrying more about keeping the recovery 
alive by lowering interest rates 
commenting on todays report commerce undersecretary michael 
darby said that the significant easing of inflationary pressures 
bodes well for continued economic expansion he said the 
administration was still looking for a significant upturn in 
activity in the second half of the year led by a rebound in growt 
in both export sales and business investment 
however private economists were far less optimistic about the 
future contending that they saw little evidence of strength 
anywhere in the economy 
what the gnp is telling us is that we have an economy that has 
run out of steam said robert dederick chief economist of the 
northern trust co in chicago there is no dynanism left in the 
expansion the consumer is tired business is tired and government 
spending is being reduced as well 
in addition to reporting on weak economic growth in the just 
completed second quarter the government sharply revised down its 
estimates of past growth 
it reduced the growth estimate for every quarter in 1989 and 
trimmed growth for the entire year to an annual rate of 25 
percent down from an earlier forecast of 3 percent 
the revision meant that the us economy in 1989 grew at its 
slowest pace since an actual decline of 25 percent in the 
recession year of 1982 
the government blamed the big downward revisions on mistakes 
that overestimated wages and salaries in 1989 by 579 billion 
faced with the weaker growth in downward revisions in past 
growth estimates the bush administration was forced to lower its 
own economic projections for this year and dramatically boost its 
estimate of the federal budget deficit for 1991 
the need to trim the deficit to 64 billion from a projected 
169 billion was a major factor forcing president bushs recent 
reversal on tax increases 
the administration is now projecting the economy will grow at an 
annual rate of 2 percent this year but to meet even this lowered 
expectation will require growth in the second half to average 29 
percent a pace far higher than most private economists believe is 
possible 
this is not a lively economy this is a very dull 
slowgrowing economy said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co 
sinai is forecasting that growth in the second half of the year 
could dip to as low as 05 percent to 1 percent a sluggish pace 
that would increase the chances that some unexpected event could 
tip the country into its first recession since 198182 
for the second quarter there were few signs of strength the 
total gnp after adjusting for inflation was growing at an annual 
rate of 416 trillion a gain of 126 billion over the first 
quarter 
more than accounting for that increase was a 355 billion rise 
in business inventories almost half of that gain came from a rise 
in auto inventories as auto manufacturers boosted production in 
anticipation of a possible strike this fall 
with auto sales still sluggish and overall consumer spending 
actually dropping economists are concerned that the big buildup in 
inventories in the second quarter will serve as a drag on growth in 
coming months forcing production cutbacks 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity actually fell by 03 percent in the second 
quarter while business investment declined 61 percent 
housing construction which has been hurt by rising mortgage 
rates dropped by 135 percent 
even merchandise trade which had been the one bright light of 
the economy turned negative in the second quarter as exports of 
goods and services fell by 37 percent while imports continued 
climbing by 32 percent

bargain hunters are filling eastern airlines cheap 
seats despite the carriers indictment on charges of falsifying 
maintenance records passengers and ticketsellers say 
i just checked for the least expensive flights and this 
happened to be one of them said ana carter of atlanta who 
hadnt heard the news before boarding the plane thursday maybe 
thats why 
the miamibased airline and nine of its highlevel managers face 
a 60count indictment unprecedented in the airline industry for 
allegedly failing to do required maintenance and falsifying records 
to indicate the work was done 
the indictment unsealed wednesday followed a 10month 
investigation and covers the period from july 1985 through october 
1989 
neglected were such critical items as radar landing gear 
automatic pilot instruments and fuel systems said andrew j 
maloney a us attorney in new york where the indictment was 
returned he said none of the alleged violations caused accidents 
or injuries 
i read it in the paper this morning after i had boarded the 
plane said longtime eastern passenger charlene ellis of 
suitland md it made me slightly uncomfortable but she said 
she would continue to fly eastern 
people still like eastern because of the cheap fares said 
drew ray manager of the vacation department at englewood travel 
englewood nj 
most of them dont even pay attention to that news like the 
indictment anyway said marsha nabors of advance travel in the 
atlanta suburb of lilburn as long as they can get these cheap 
fares with no penalties theyll ride 
but not everybody seemed to feel that way 
i can promise you this until the problem is fixed i will 
make no more reservations on eastern airlines patricia middleton 
of washington said after arriving in miami 
eastern insists theres nothing to worry about 
there is no carrier out there who has received nearly the 
scrutiny we have in the past couple of years said spokeswoman 
karen ceremsak in miami thats why a passenger can feel 
reasonably comfortable about flying with us theres been no stone 
left unturned 
she said eastern took out fullpage advertisements in several 
major papers today to reassure customers 
the ad which ran in the washington post the wall street 
journal and usa today among other papers said today about 
60000 people will fly eastern they have a right to know they are 
flying a safe airline 
signed by eastern bankruptcy trustee martin r shugrue jr the 
ad says two years ago some eastern employees in new york 
falsified maintenance records to reflect work that had not been 
done today if eastern werent meeting the highest government 
standards of safety we would not be flying 
most agents said they had noticed no change in demand for 
eastern seats 
not one soul has said they wont fly eastern said gerard 
gonzalez owner of lets go travel inc in new york 
seats are so scarce the cheap seats to florida that theyll 
take anything said mark kazlauskas of travel network in 
brooklyn we do have one or two people say they wont fly 
eastern but thats because theyre union workers and they wont 
fly it 
eastern is struggling with a 16monthold strike by its 
machinists union that helped push the carrier into bankruptcy 
reorganization proceedings it is attempting to regain the 
fullfare business customers that airlines depend on

philip morris cos on friday ruled 
out any changes of its 38 billion tender offer for the parent 
company of jacobs suchard ag the huge chocolate and coffee group 
in a brief statement the new yorkbased tobacco food and 
brewing company responded to an analysis by a swiss bank bank 
vontobel of zurich which suggested that public shareholders should 
refuse the offer as being too low 
under a june agreement with suchard chief executive klaus j 
jacobs philip morris obtained control of jacobss private company 
colima holding ag which held 62 percent of the voting rights but 
only 28 percent of the capital of suchard 
to enable philip morris to acquire full ownership of the swiss 
company other shareholders have until sept 3 to accept the tender 
offer 
the offer is 8500 swiss francs or 6071 for each bearer 
share 1660 francs or 1185 for each registered share and 758 
francs or 541 per participation certificate 
philip morris said bank vontobels analysis was inaccurate and 
misleading and that it has no plans to alter either the price or 
the timing or any other elements of its tender offer for shares of 
jacobs suchard 
particularly misleading in the bank vontobel research report 
is the implication that philip morris might increase the tender 
price in order to obtain possible us tax benefits it added 
the bank had suggested that philip morris could lose large us 
tax benefits if it did not acquire 80 percent of suchards capital 
philip morris responded that regardless of any possible us 
tax benefits and whether or not it obtains 80 percent of the 
jacobs suchard shares philip morris has no intention of making any 
changes in the terms and conditions of the tender offer

opec oil ministers agreed today to raise the 
cartels prices and restrain production in hope of forcing up crude 
prices by several dollars in the next few months 
all 13 ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries signed the accord raising the target price to 21 a 
barrel from 18 because of an oil glut the actual price recently 
has been about 1625 per barrel 
the agreement set a new production ceiling of 225 million 
barrels a day a bit above the current cap but lower than the 
cartels actual output to reach the new target price opec will 
have to rein in production by about 700000 barrels a day 
word of the agreement sent oil prices higher in international 
trading in london north sea brent a widely used benchmark 
jumped 39 cents from thursday to 1965 a barrel for september 
delivery 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude rose 9 cents to 2039 per 42gallon 
barrel 
iranian oil minister gholam reza aqazadeh said the agreement 
would be valid through the end of the year asked whether he was 
confident the output levels would be adhered to he said at this 
time i am sure 100 percent 
the announcement capped the regular midyear opec meeting which 
began thursday and was overshadowed by a bitter dispute involving 
opec members iraq kuwait and the united arab emirates 
iraq blamed the other two countries for a drop in oil prices 
saying they had exceeded their output quotas kuwait and the uae 
deny the claims 
iraqi president saddam hussein threatened last week to use 
military force against cheaters and diplomats reported an iraqi 
military buildup at the kuwait border 
in reaching agreement the ministers persuaded iraqi minister 
issam abdul raheem alchalabi to back off his demand for a 25 a 
barrel target price others said 25 was too high 
the previous target price of 18 had been in effect since 
december 1986 the production limit was about 2209 million barrels 
a day based on individual quotas set for each member nation 
kuwait and the uae have been accused often of exceeding their 
output quotas and saddam claims his cashhungry nation has lost 
14 billion in oil revenue because of the resulting slide in prices 
aqazadeh said the new agreement was reached at the highest 
levels of the opec governments so he was confident the output 
levels it would be strictly followed 
the minimum reference price is 21 and the ceiling is 
22491 he said 
aqazadeh said ministers also agreed that in future they will 
increase their production ceiling and target price in tandem 
rather than keeping the price constant while varying quotas as they 
have for more than three years 
crude prices and gasoline prices at the pump would not 
automatically climb just because opec notched up its benchmark but 
if the cartel reined in production crude prices could rise 
each dollar increase per barrel raises gasoline prices at the 
pump by about 5 cents a gallon 
energy experts said consumers will also probably see a jump in 
prices of gasoline and heating oil but they said it was not likely 
to occur right away 
we have a crude oil surplus currently of 50 million barrels 
in the united states and its going to take at least a year 
to work off that excess said brian tagler an energy broker with 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec surged 
to 2046 a barrel in early january but skidded to 1364 last 
month it rebounded to 1625 last week 
an output cap of 225 million barrels a day would be 400000 
barrels more than the current ceiling but it would be under the 
cartels actual production estimated at 23 million barrels or more 
a day 
under the plan the uaes quota will rise from 11 million 
barrels a day to 15 million it now is producing about 2 million 
barrels a day analysts say 
the arrangement also would require kuwait to trim output by 
several hundred thousand barrels a day to bring it down to its 
quota of 15 million barrels 
other members quotas would remain the sameopec nations are 
algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq kuwait libya 
nigeria qatar saudi arabia the uae and venezuela 
the agreement does not end the dispute between iraq and kuwait 
iraq claims kuwait stole oil from a field that includes land both 
sides claim and it wants compensation representatives from the 
nations are to hold direct talks this weekend in an effort to 
resolve the dispute 
the talks are to be in saudi arabia this weekend 
in a rare show of solidarity with iraq iran today echoed the 
iraqi attack on states violating opec quotas iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani did not mention names he said his countrys 
cooperation with its war foe iraq had helped lift the price of 
oil

house majority leader richard gephardt 
declined today to criticize a bush administration budget proposal 
that includes higher taxes on wine and beer and a limit on federal 
deductions for state and local taxes 
i prefer not to comment on these proposals said gephardt 
dmo emerging from the latest budget meeting between president 
bush and congressional leaders everythings on the table 
the administration has not formally presented its proposal at 
the 11weekold budget talks saying it wants to exchange plans 
simultaneously with democrats but details of the package have 
begun to emerge 
the administration proposal would raise the 16cent tax on 
sixpacks of beer to 81 cents and the 3cent levy on the standard 
750 milliliter bottle of wine to 76 cents a gop bargainer said 
the proposal would limit wealthy americans ability to take 
deductions on their federal income tax returns for the state and 
local income taxes they pay and would cut medicare and other 
programs gop bargainers say 
overall it would save about 54 billion next year split evenly 
between new taxes and program trims said one negotiator 
gephardt said he didnt know if democrats will piece together a 
proposal of their own before congress summer recess which begins 
as early as next friday 
but with protests already emerging about elements of the 
administration proposal gephardt declined to attack the plan 
i expect that whatever we come out with well hear from a lot 
of our citizens wholl say i wish you hadnt done that 
gephardt told reporters 
an increase in the federal beer and wine tax would be the first 
since 1951 
democrats have all but concluded that the two sides will be 
unable to forge a budget compromise for fiscal 1991 until after 
congress monthlong summer recess which starts in early august 
democrats have yet to piece together their own deficitreduction 
proposal for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
whats taken this thing so long is the fact that there is no 
apparent crisis out there to drive the administration to drive 
congress to move more rapidly said no 3 house democrat william 
gray dpa 
the administration package would set a 10000 limit on the 
amount of state and local income taxes that a couple or individual 
may deduct when calculating their federal income tax the 
restriction would raise between 19 billion and 3 billion for the 
government next year 
sen bob packwood a gop budget negotiator from oregon said 
974 percent of the people affected by the proposed ceiling earn 
more than 100000 annually and 86 percent of them make more than 
200000 
if that isnt a tax on the wealthy i dont know what is 
packwood told reporters 
but iowa gov terry branstad a republican and chairman of the 
national governors association said the governors are very 
apprehensive about anything that would reduce the flexibility of 
states to be able to deal with their own situation in terms of 
revenue sources that are traditionally the states 
new york mayor david dinkins a democrat said he recently 
balanced the citys budget by raising local taxes adding one of 
the reasons we did so is because of the deductibility of those 
taxes 
the administration proposal reduces spending on benefit programs 
by 16 billion one official said the biggest chunk of that is the 
250 billion medicare program which would see payments to 
beneficiaries doctors and hospitals trimmed by 6 billion other 
cuts would be made in spending for agriculture veterans and 
federal workers 
the plan trims defense spending by about 7 billion at least 
3 billion less than democrats prefer and it cuts domestic and 
foreign aid programs by 4 billion 
some gop congressional negotiators said privately that they 
opposed the administration budget proposal which white house 
officials first shopped to house and senate republicans on 
wednesday others emphasized that the plan was meant only as a 
first offer to democrats 
were a highly flexible operation said white house budget 
director richard darman

aetna life amp casualty said friday that 
secondquarter profits were up 34 million over last year 
primarily because of significant improvements in group insurance 
the insurance company reported secondquarter net income of 204 
million or 182 per share compared to 170 million or 152 per 
share in 1989 
however aetna reported revenue of 48 billion in the quarter 
ending june 30 down from 5 billion in the 1989 period the 
revenue includes 32 billion in premiums down from 34 billion 
last year 
we had significantly better group insurance results said 
aetna chairman james t lynn group insurance earnings of 79 
million in the quarter were 24 million higher than last year 
however our commercial insurance and reinsurance results 
continue to reflect a soft pricing environment and our personal 
auto insurance business is still suffering from high loss costs and 
inadequate rates lynn said 
for the first six months of 1990 net income was 384 million or 
343 per share compared with 343 million or 304 per share for 
the same period last year 
revenue totaled 959 billion with premiums of 64 billion 
down slightly from the 1989 period when the company had 96 
billion in revenue and 65 billion in premiums

usx corp has agreed to pay 34 million in costs 
and penalties for the cleanup of wastewater that was illegally 
dumped from its gary ind steel mill federal officials said today 
the agreement stems from a 1988 lawsuit filed by the federal 
government alleging that usx exceeded discharge limits in the grand 
calumet river the suit also alleged the company had made other 
violations of the federal clean water act 
under the agreement the company will pay 16 million in 
penalties and an estimated 25 million in cleanup and 
wastemanagement measures officials of the us environmental 
protection agency and the us attorneys office said 
the company also agreed to pay 25 million on a study to 
determine the extent of sediment contamination in the grand 
calumet located in northern indiana another 5 million will be 
allocated to clean up whatever contamination is found 
dale s bryson water division director for epas region 5 said 
todays settlement was among the top 10 in fines for illegal 
wastewater dumping but usx will pay more than any other company 
for actual cleanup measures he said 
in the lawsuit the epa contended that usx formerly us steel 
illegally bypassed its blast furnace wastewater treatment system 
dumping polluted water directly into the grand calumet and lake 
michigan on several occasions 
in september 1989 epa recommended that the usxgary works plant 
be suspended from doing business with the federal government 
because of the violations the recommendation will be withdrawn 
once the decree has been entered in the us district court in 
hammond officials said

the us economy sputtered at an anemic annual 
growth rate of 12 percent from april through june with virtually 
every economic sector exhibiting weakness the government said 
friday 
the commerce department report on the gross national product 
the countrys total output of goods and services renewed 
recession fears among private economists the bush administration 
insisted that weakness in the first half of the year will be 
followed by a rebound in the last part of 1990 
the administration said a significant slowdown in inflation 
would give the federal reserve room to lower interest rates and 
thus spark a rebound in consumer and business activity 
inflation was the one bright spot in the gnp report a price 
index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 39 percent in the 
apriljune quarter down from a 66 percent spurt in the first 
three months of the year half of the inflation improvement was 
attributed to a drop in food costs 
but adding to the pessimism of private economists was a 
significant downward revision in previous gnp estimates which made 
the economys performance for the past year look even weaker than 
previously believed 
gnp growth in the first three months was revised down to a 17 
percent rate compared to 19 percent previously while growth from 
october through december was cut to a barely perceptible 03 
percent far below the 11 percent previous estimate 
the results of all the changes lowered gnp growth for 1989 from 
an original estimate of 3 percent down to 25 percent the weakest 
performance since an outright decline of 25 percent in the 
recession year of 1982 
the economy looks as close to a recession as it can get 
without actually being in one said allen sinai chief economist 
of the boston co we have a crummy economy and that presents big 
problems for policy makers 
president bush has already had to reverse his stand on taxes in 
an effort to cope with a federal budget deficit that is being 
swollen by lowerthanexpected economic growth and falling tax 
revenues 
last week the administration slashed its forecast of economic 
growth to 2 percent for this year but to reach even that 
scaleddown goal would require growth to accelerate to a 29 
percent rate in the last half of 1990 
most private economists called such a speedup improbable given 
the widespread weakness evident in the second quarter gnp report 
they said the best that could be hoped for was a continuation of 
sluggish growth with the worst outcome being a drop into an actual 
recession 
we have an economy that has run out of steam said robert 
dederick chief economist of the northern trust co of chicago 
it is being kept on a life support system by the federal reserve 
but there is always a risk that it will just fade away 
however commerce undersecretary michael darby presenting the 
administrations views on the gnp report sought to paint a less 
bleak picture he said part of the second quarter weakness was a 
result of warmer winter weather spurring construction activity and 
consumer spending in the first quarter which would normally have 
occurred in the spring 
the administration for months has been pressuring the fed to 
relent and ease interest rates more darby said that the drop in 
inflation pressures shown in the gnp report bodes well for 
continued economic expansion by providing more maneuvering room 
for the fed to lower interest rates 
the gnp rose by only 126 billion in the second quarter to an 
annual rate of 416 trillion 
that gain was more than accounted for by a 355 billion jump in 
business inventories much of that in the auto industry where 
production was boosted in anticipation of a possible strike during 
the third quarter 
richard rahn chief economist of the us chamber of commerce 
blamed the economic weakness on illfounded worries at the federal 
reserve abut inflation he called on the fed to lower interest 
rates and for congress and the administration to abandon any 
thoughts of imposing a 25 billion tax increase on such a weak 
economy 
the economy is now one step away from a fullblown 
recession he said the fed must reverse present tight money 
policies and lower interest rates time is running out

abbott laboratories and its ousted chairman 
robert a schoellhorn have reached an agreement on schoellhorns 
lawsuit against the company although officials have provided few 
details of the settlement 
schoellhorn 61 sued the north chicagobased drug manufacturer 
after the board voted to remove him as chief executive officer and 
chairman he contended abbott breached a contract to employ him as 
chairman until his retirement at age 65 
in a oneparagraph statement wednesday abbott said 
schoellhorns suit will be dismissed and he will retire from abbott 
on aug 31 
schoellhorns lawyer john mathias wouldnt comment on the 
settlement 
the settlement apparently rescinds abbotts firing of 
schoellhorn which took place in april after a state court lifted a 
temporary restraining order obtained by schoellhorn 
abbotts board had voted in december to remove him as chief 
executive and on march 9 to remove him as chairman 
schoellhorn filed suit the same day claiming the dismissal was 
contrary to company bylaws and pursuant to fraudulent board 
resolutions 
the company had charged in court documents that schoellhorn 
misappropriated corporate assets through private use of company 
airplanes and falsified expense reports 
the company also alleged he caused company employees to perform 
personal services for him and to buy personal items for him with 
company funds 
schoellhorn denied the charges

soybean futures prices fell sharply friday on the 
chicago board of trade amid profittaking that erased most of the 
previous sessions gains and sparked corresponding selloffs in the 
grain markets 
in the absence of bullish news the soybean market could not 
sustain the price levels reached thursday amid signs of strong 
soybean meal demand and prospective soviet buying analysts said 
instead traders returned their attention to the midwestern 
weather forecasts which continue to look good for soybean and corn 
crop development 
what the market is really saying is that weather conditions 
are ideal throughout the midwest said gerald zusel director of 
balfour maclaine corps floor operations at the board of trade 
although we had good soymeal demand yesterday in europe there 
was not enough on a continuing basis to keep the market at 
yesterdays levels he said 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in september at 298 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with september at 263 a bushel oats 
were 3 cents to 3 cents lower with september at 129 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 12 cents lower with august at 585 a

the house and senate voted friday to impose 
economic sanctions on iraq and government sources said the bush 
administration is considering its own milder moves against the 
baghdad government 
the senate which took the strongest action voted 8016 to cut 
off 12 billion in us loan guarantees that iraq now uses to buy 
american wheat rice lumber cattle and commercial goods such as 
tires and machinery 
acting on an amendment by sen alfonse damato rny senators 
also moved to bar sales to iraq of weapons sensitive technology 
and items which can be used for military purposes the amendment 
was made part of the 1990 farm bill 
the move and a watereddown sanctions package approved by the 
house were signs of growing congressional concern about iraqs 
human rights abuses intimidation of its neighbors harboring of 
terrorists and developing chemical and nuclear weapons programs 
there comes a time when we have to stand up and be counted 
said sen nancy kassebaum rkan who conceded that the sanctions 
could hurt kansas wheat farmers but she said human rights 
considerations including reports of government torture of 
children outweigh economics 
i cant believe any farmer in this nation would want to send 
his products under subsidized sales to a country that has used 
chemical weapons and a country that has tortured and executed its 
children she said 
state department spokesman richard boucher said the 
congressional action would not be helpful to us diplomatic 
efforts to moderate the behavior of the government of president 
saddam hussein 
but at the same time government sources said the bush 
administration was seriously considering its own options for action 
against iraq which could signal us displeasure without totally 
alienating the iraqi president 
options included putting iraq back on the us list of terrorist 
nations which would end commodity loan guarantees and 
exportimport bank credits for purchase of american industrial 
goods also possible would be a more limited move to tighten 
restrictions on us exports 
this is a freight train coming down the track from congress 
said one senior administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity there is plenty of impetus the question becomes do 
we want to be active or let capitol hill do it to us 
the house foreign affairs committee scheduled action for next 
week on a bill drafted by rep howard berman dcalif that would 
impose a similar list of sanctions on iraq still other sanctions 
were contained in an export administration act pending on the 
senate calendar 
in fridays voting sanctions advocates on both sides of the 
capitol primarily the israel lobby overpowered farmstate 
interests who were concerned about losing a substantial market for 
wheat rice and other commodities 
but agriculture forces in the house remembering the disastrous 
1980 us grain embargo against the soviet union were able to 
create a substantial loophole the sanctions can be waived if they 
are hurting farmers worse than the iraqis 
inclusion by both houses of sanctions means that some form of 
penalty against iraq is virtually certain to be in the final 
version of the farm bill that will emerge from housesenate 
negotiations later this year 
arguing for his amendment on the senate floor damato compared 
the iraqi president to adolf hitler and called him a mad dog 
and a butcher 
others were more moderate decrying iraqs human rights record 
and characterizing the vote as a move to assert us leadership in 
the world against terrorism and outlaw behavior 
when are we going to start exercising some moral leadership in 
this country asked sen william cohen rmaine i think the 
time has come right now to bow to domestic financial 
considerations he said would reduce us policy to one of 
appeasement

the national candy wholesalers association 
aiming to boost the annual candy consumption of americans from 197 
pounds per person to 20 pounds has a list of candy facts to 
soothe your guilty conscience and convince you that sweet treats 
may even be good for you 
association president william elfenbein of denver admits that 
some of the statements such as candy doesnt make you fat and 
candy is nutritious probably would make nutritionists 
shudder and he concedes that too much of anything can be bad 
you wouldnt want to eat just candy said elfenbein 53 who 
is in atlanta for the groups convention but for most people it 
could be the bright note in a very dull day 
connie crawley a registered dietician at the university of 
georgia agreed balance is the key 
sugar has no nutritional value at all except calories we 
dont promote sugar but we arent saying its the worst food and 
you should never eat it again she said 
for now the 7000 buyers and distributors attending the 
convention at the georgia world congress center arent counting 
calories as they wander through a trickortreaters paradise 
filled with mouthwatering wonders 
through saturday they can gorge themselves on new and old 
goodies in a sample room filled with every candy bar imaginable 
including favorites like zero almond joy milky way red hots and 
sweet tarts 
we give everybody a sack and let them go through the room 
some eat while they fill up their bags said shelley grossman 
estersohn communications director for the washingtonbased 
association 
estersohn said the group is hoping candy consumption will rise 
on its own to 20 pounds per person by the end of the year the list 
of candy facts was contained in a handout available to buyers 
and reporters attending the convention 
the convention which opened thursday includes an exhibition 
hall where browsers can take a look and a sample from more than 680

the bad news continued to mount for the 
nations two largest defense contractors friday as two large 
commercial bond rating firms downgraded the companies bond ratings 
it was the second time this year that ratings had been lowered 
for mcdonnell douglas corp and general dynamics corp both 
headquartered in st louis 
mcdonnell douglas the biggest defense contractor had its bond 
rating dropped two notches by moodys investment service from baa1 
to baa3 the lowest category of investment grade bonds 
its the third time in just over a year that mcdonnell douglas 
bond ratings have been reduced by moodys 
standard amp poors corp also reduced the companys subordinated 
debt rating from a to bbbplus and its unsubordinated debt from 
bbbplus to bbb its the second time standard amp poors has reduced the 
companys rating this year 
moodys bond analyst tassos philippakos said last weeks 
announcement by mcdonnell douglas to reduce its workforce by up to 
11 percent and cut other costs to save 700 million this year isnt 
enough to solve all of the companys problems 
we expect that to have some positive impact in the future but 
its going to take time and time is a luxury that management 
doesnt have right now he said 
the company is facing cost overruns and delays on several large 
defense projects along with record backlogs and inefficiencies in 
its commercial jetbuilding operation in long beach calif 
mcdonnell douglas spokeswoman barbara anderson said the rating 
downgrades were disappointing 
mcdonnell douglas does not feel its performance financial 
condition or future prospects warrant these measures she said 
meanwhile standard amp poors reduced general dynamics senior 
debt rating from aplus to a and its subordinated debt from a to a in 
january standard amp poors reduced the companys rating from aa to 
aplus 
bond analyst david sotnick said the companys 240 million loss 
in the second quarter and the dismal outlook for the defense 
industry prompted the recent downgrading 
moodys reduced general dynamics bonds last month

an agreement by opec oil ministers friday to 
restrain crude production had little effect on wholesale prices 
but some experts said motorists could feel pinched at the pumps by 
early 1991 if the cartel sticks with the pact 
prices of energy futures settled slightly lower after initially 
rising on news of the opec pact some traders blamed technical 
factors and profittaking from a recent price runup for the fall 
the accord signed friday by all 13 ministers of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries would raise the target price of 
the cartels crude to 21 a barrel from 18 the actual price has 
been as low as 1625 per barrel recently because of a worldwide 
oil glut 
to achieve its price increase the cartel set a new daily output 
ceiling of 225 million barrels a bit above the current cap but 
lower than its actual production in all opec will have to rein in 
production by about 700000 barrels a day 
theres a better chance than in the past of their adhering to 
this agreement said james r fiedler a vice president at 
edampf man international futures inc in new york 
for the first time we have the united arab emirates agreeing 
to a quota and we have an enforcer in iraq 
iraq last week threatened to use military force against cartel 
members exceeding their output quotas it said kuwait and the 
united arab emirates largely were responsible for the current glut 
oil traders had been predicting opec would take action to curb 
production and that anticipation helped sharply boost wholesale 
prices in recent weeks 
for instance since june 1 crude oil futures have risen about 
3 a barrel unleaded gasoline about 14 cents and home heating 
oil around 10 cents according to energy experts 
james steel an energy analyst with refco inc in new york said 
the general rule of thumb is that every dollar rise in a barrel of 
crude oil means a nickel rise at the pumps 
he said that if the opec agreement pushes crude up 350 to 4 a 
barrel as some expect will happen by december we could see an 
increase of between 15 cents and 20 cents in early 1991 
analysts said it will take that long for consumers to start 
seeing an increase on the retail level because of the oil glut 
in the united states supplies of unleaded gasoline are up 10 
percent from a year ago to 1672 million barrels from 15632 
million crude stocks are up 50 million from 1989 to 3387 million 
barrels from 3306 million 
western europe and japan face similar situations steel said 
in subdued trading friday on the new york mercantile exchange 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude settled down 26 cents to 2004 a 42gallon 
barrel the contract had lost 8 cents on thursday 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange 
unleaded gasoline for august delivery finished down 038 cent to 
6488 cents a gallon after rising more than 2 cents a gallon 
earlier in the session the contract settled up 222 cents on 
thursday 
traders said gasolines sharp rise earlier in the session was 
due mostly to internal market influences 
the august contract for wholesale heating oil which gained 056 
cent on thursday settled at 5697 cents a gallon off 035 cents 
in natural gas trading the september contract settled at 1439 
per 1000 cubic feet up from 1435 wednesday

shell oil co said friday its secondquarter 
earnings fell 63 percent from the same period a year ago which the 
company attributed in part to a 76 million writeoff for 
investments in offshore oil and gas properties 
secondquarter earnings totaled 161 million compared with 279 
million a year ago the houstonbased company does not have per 
share earnings because it is a wholly owned subsidiary of royal 
dutchshell groups 
shell said it took a writeoff on certain offshore california oil 
and gas properties because of delays in securing development 
permits 
the prolonged delays experienced in developing offshore 
california properties have been a source of deep concern to us 
recent events indicate that these problems are getting worse in 
spite of our nations increasing dependence on foreign oil 
supplies said shell president frank h richardson 
shell also wrote off the cost of an artifical island and 
exploration wells associated with an oil discovery in the beaufort 
sea off alaska that was determined to be noncommercial 
the combined writeoffs amounted to 76 million shell said 
the company said secondquarter earnings this year fell in all 
three major business divisions 
oil and gas exploration and production results declined mainly 
due to sharply lower crude oil prices and the asset writeoffs 
earnings in the oil products segment were adversely impacted by a 
heavy program of scheduled refinery maintenance and increased 
environmental expenditures richardson said 
chemical products earnings declined from last years record 
levels mainly due to lower margins he said 
earnings also were down for the first six months net income for 
the first half of the year was 363 million a 55 percent decline 
from 801 million for the same 1989 period 
revenues were 52 billion for the 1990 second quarter compared 
with 59 billion a year ago for the first six months they were 
109 billion compared with 11 billion in 1989

a taxpayer bailout of a troubled student loan 
guarantor would not cost more than 100 million a senior education 
department official said friday 
ted sanders under secretary of education said the department 
hoped to resolve the problems of the higher education assistance 
foundation or heaf without taxpayer money 
but 100 million would be the outside number he told the 
senate banking committee 
heaf a private nonprofit agency based in overland park kan 
is the guarantor of 88 billion in student loans or more than 17 
percent of the 51 billion student loans outstanding nationally it 
is the largest of 47 guaranty agencies which are either staterun 
agencies or private nonprofit groups 
it had said earlier that a high loan default rate particularly 
on loans to trade school students threatened to push it into 
insolvency and sought help from the federal government 
bankers warn that commercial lenders would flee the student loan 
market if heaf defaulted and lenders were forced to take losses on 
the guaranteed loans 
however sanders reassured nervous students and parents that 
loans would be available this fall and said the education 
department intended to act decisively to arrange for the orderly 
management of the heaf portfolio 
despite alarmist reports in the media this situation will not 
affect the ability of students to obtain loans of lenders to make 
those loans or of guarantors to insure those loans he said 
the program last year loaned more than 12 billion to 4 million 
students according to the general accounting office congress 
auditing agency 
meanwhile sallie mae the governmentsponsored student loan 
company said friday it is talking with the education department 
about rescuing heaf 
sallie mae the student loan marketing association is a 
federally chartered but shareholderowned secondary market company 
through several mechanisms it finances about 40 percent of all 
student loans dominating the industry 
in response to a report in fridays editions of the wall street 
journal that it had made a bid to take over heaf sallie mae 
confirmed the department of education has invited sallie mae to 
propose ways in which it could participate in a resolution of 
heafs financial difficulties 
it said among the options being explored on a preliminary 
basis is the possibility of sallie maes being designated as a 
guarantor of student loans 
although sallie maes charter permits it to enter that end of 
the business so far it has not bankers and the guarantor agencies 
are opposing the expansion 
the national council of higher education loan programs which 
represents the guaranty agencies told the committee it would be a 
potential conflict of interest for sallie mae as a loan holder to 
rule as a guarantor on its own claims for defaulted loans 
also the expansion would make sallie mae so dominant in the 
student loan field that the government would have to meet any 
demands for concessions that it made argued jean s frohlicher 
executive director of the council 
earlier an administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the education department also was considering a 
takeover offer from the united student aid funds the 
secondlargest guarantor agency headquartered in indianapolis 
officials have scrapped the idea of turning heaf over to a 
smaller agency the nebraska student loan program inc

soybean futures prices fell sharply friday on the chicago board 
of trade amid profittaking that erased most of the previous 
sessions gains and sparked selloffs in the corn oat and wheat 
markets 
on other commodity markets energy futures were mixed copper 
futures rose precious metals fell and livestock and meat futures 
were mixed 
soybean futures settled 3 cents to 11 cents lower with august 
down 8 cents at 584 
the august soybean contract had risen 8 cents and other soybean 
contracts rose as much as 12 cents on thursday 
there was little bullish news friday to help the soybean market 
sustain the price levels it reached thursday amid signs of strong 
soybean meal demand and prospective soviet buying analysts said 
instead traders returned their attention to the midwestern 
weather forecasts which continue to look good for soybean and corn 
crop development 
what the market is really saying is that weather conditions 
are ideal throughout the midwest said gerald zusel director of 
balfour maclaine corps floor operations at the board of trade 
although we had good soymeal demand yesterday in europe there 
was not enough on a continuing basis to keep the market at 
yestedays levels he said 
after fridays close the market received more bearish weather 
news the national weather service issued a new sixto10day 
forecast predicting belownormal temperatures and abovenormal 
rainfall in the midwest aug 2 through aug 6 
in grain trading wheat futures settled 2 cents to 3 cents 
lower with september at 298 a bushel corn was cent to 2 
cents lower with september at 262 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 
3 cents lower with september at 130 a bushel 
petroleum futures finished mixed with nearterm deliveries down 
moderately after opec oil ministers meeting in geneva agreed as 
expected on a higher target price and new output quotas for crude 
oil 
the new target price of 21 per barrel is 3 above the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries previous reference 
price 
the opec ministers also agreed to limit production to 225 
million barrels per day which is 400000 barrels above the old 
ceiling but below the cartels acutal estimated output of 23 
million barrels or more per day 
opec leaders hope the higher production ceiling will prevent 
cheating by cartel members whose overproduction has been blamed for 
weak crude oil prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents lower to 15 
cents higher with september at 2004 a barrel heating oil was 35 
cent lower to 08 cent higher with august at 5697 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 55 cent lower to 03 cent higher with august 
at 6488 cents a gallon 
copper futures climbed sharply on new yorks commodity exchange 
extending recent gains amid continuing concerns about supply 
availability and a strike that began thursday against perus 
stateowned mineroperu mining and refining company 
another supportive factor was a forecast from the us copper 
producer asarco inc that world copper consumption will 
significantly outstrip production this year said peter cardillo 
director of commodities research with jesup josephthal amp co in 
new york 
copper settled 13 cents to 3 cents higher with july at 1268 a 
pound 
gold futures retreated for the second straight day but closed 
above their lows cardillo said the august contracts bounce off 
36580 indicated the market could rally next week 
gold settled 170 to 220 lower with august at 368 a troy 
ounce silver was 18 cents to 23 cents lower with july at 4831

livestock and meat futures ened mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange ahead of the agriculture departments semiannual cattle 
inventory report which contained no surprises 
the usda estimated the nations calf and cattle herd as of july 
1 at 1089 million head which was near expectations and confirmed 
ideas that the herd is slowly expanding 
live cattle futures settled 22 cent lower to 30 cent higher 
with august at 7795 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent 
lower to 50 cent higher with august at 8912 cents a pound live

the dollar fell sharply friday as traders 
disheartened by a further weakening in the economy grew convinced 
that the federal reserve will be forced to push us interest rates 
lower 
gold prices slipped despite the weakened dollar 
the dollar was hit hard by a commerce department report that the 
gross national product grew at an annual rate of just 12 percent 
during the second quarter 
the gnp which measures the countrys total output of goods and 
services was supported solely by a big buildup in business 
inventories other major components of the economy including 
consumer spending business investment and housing construction 
suffered declines 
the poor showing followed a meager 17 percent increase in the 
first quarter and an even more paltry 03 percent advance in the 
final quarter of 1989 
the overwhelming majority of the market believes were in a 
recession its heard too many things to suggest otherwise said 
robert ryan chief foreign exchange dealer with bank of new york co 
the financial markets believe that with the economy continuing 
to slump the fed will have to let interest rates fall to help 
stimulate growth 
but such a move would come at the expense of the dollar 
currencies are supported by higher interest rates so a drop in 
us yields makes the dollar less competitive 
rates are currently higher in europe so anything on the 
continent is doing super ryan said 
that was evident friday as the british pound surged more than 2 
cents against the dollar sterling rose to 18375 in new york from 
late thursdays 18145 in london earlier the british pound rose 
to 18350 from 18133 
other dollar rates in new york compared with late thursdays 
prices included 16120 west german marks down from 16230 
13620 swiss francs down from 13773 53990 french francs down 
from 54360 118000 italian lire down from 118750 and 115195 
canadian dollars down from 115265 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late rates 
thursday included 16145 west german marks down from 16220 
13680 swiss francs down from 13780 54080 french francs down 
from 54355 18205 dutch guilders down from 18290 118200 
italian lire down from 118750 and 11521 canadian dollars up 
from 11513 
the dollar fell to 14910 japanese yen in new york from 15035 
late thursday in tokyo earlier the dollar rose 064 yen to a 
closing 15075 yen and it was quoted in london at 14970 yen 
gold often benefits from a decline in the dollar but technical 
factors carried the precious metal lower friday 
gold fell 150 on the commodity exchange in new york to 36780 
a troy ounce republic national bank of new york later quoted a bid 
of 36730 down 150 from thursday

a local car dealer is blasting as racist a 
regional cadillac television ad campaign that uses world war ii 
footage to depict the downfall of japanese auto competitors 
mark hennessy owner of hennessy cadillacjaguar in atlanta 
placed ads in fridays editions of the atlanta journalconstitution 
denouncing the ad campaign by the cadillac dealers of the south 
his ads called the campaign obscene racist and an admission by 
the company that cadillac is not marketable against japanese 
luxury cars on a feature for feature or value for dollar basis 
the ads use world war ii footage depicting a dogfight 
representing the competition between american and japanese cars 
with the slogan out of the land of the rising sun comes the land 
of rising prices it shows a japanese zero fighter plane crashing 
into the ocean as the announcer says compared to cadillacs our 
competitors are real zeros 
its a xenophobic fear of the japanese culture hennessy 
said friday in an interview 
hennessy whose dealership also sells the japanesemade lexus 
said he first complained about the ads during a special screening 
for dealers last month he said he told both cadillac zone managers 
and representatives of the ad agency babbit amp reiman that the ads 
would offend cadillac owners and scare away potential customers 
the ads give the idea that we as cadillac dealers arent 
selling our cars on the basis of value but that we have to just 
rely on emotion he said im selling due to the quality of the 
car and the quality of my employees and loyalty of my owner case 
he also said cadillac owners and potential customers have been 
calling his company to complain since the television ads first 
aired 
paul schmidt atlanta zone manager for cadillac did not return 
phone calls friday 
but joey reiman chairman of babbit amp reiman said his agencys 
campaign is being misinterpreted 
our job is to sell cadillacs for southeastern cadillac 
dealers this tv spot does just that he said our targets are 
veterans who cant understand why their children are not buying 
american cars 
the real zeros here are people who are taking this too 
seriously 
the ads are being run throughout the south on behalf of more 
than 193 southern cadillac dealers 
reiman said the campaign is not racist he said another ad in 
the campaign which has not been aired yet targets lincoln cars 
this ad features images of abraham lincoln and says take it from 
lincoln buy a cadillac 
its not just the japanese were after its all 
competition reiman said 
reiman also said hennessy may be upset about the ad because his 
dealership also sells japanese cars 
but hennessy said he designed his newspaper ad to apologize to 
any of our customers or prospective customers who may be offended 
by these ads 
im not on a soapbox im just trying to protect the business 
my family built over 26 years he said

usx corp will pay about 34 million in penalties 
and cleanup costs for dumping wastewater from its gary ind steel 
mill under an agreement announced friday by federal officials 
we believe this consent decree is a major victory for the 
muchabused grand calumet river said ralph r bauer deputy 
regional administrator for the us environmental protection 
agency we expect this decree to provide a framework for 
improvement and cleanup at the usx plant 
the outofcourt settlement resolves a 1988 lawsuit filed by the 
federal government alleging that the gary mill exceeded wastewater 
discharge limits in the river the lawsuit also alleged that the 
company violated the federal clean water act in other ways between 
1983 and 1988 
under the agreement announced by the epa and the us attorneys 
office for northern indiana the company will pay 16 million in 
civil penalties and an estimated 25 million to improve equipment 
and develop a comprehensive wastewater management plan 
the company has also agreed to pay 25 million on a study to 
determine the extent of sediment contamination in the grand calumet 
in northern indiana an additional 5 million will be allocated to 
clean up whatever contamination is found 
this is a consent decree said george kuebler a spokesman 
for usxs gary mill there are no admissions to any allegations 
the evidence that we are committed to the environment can be seen 
by agreeing to this decree which calls for spending beyond what is 
statutorily required 
dale s bryson of the regional epa office said the agreement 
ranks among the top 10 settlements ever received by the epa 
he said the 75 million the company will pay in total river 
cleanup costs is the highest amount ever negotiated specifically 
for that purpose 
bryson said the epa expects usx to complete the improvement 
efforts in two years 
the company could face additional penalties ranging from 750 
a day to 17500 a day for any missed deadlines bryson said 
in addition the epa must approve the companys cleanup and 
improvement plans and usx is obligated to pay the difference if 
costs exceed estimates made in the agreement he said 
in the lawsuit the epa contended that usx formerly us steel 
illegally bypassed its blast furnace wastewater treatment system 
dumping polluted water directly into the grand calumet and lake 
michigan on several occasions 
last september epa recommended that the usxgary works plant be 
suspended from doing business with the federal government because 
of the violations the agency will withdraw this recommendation 
once the decree has been entered in us district court in hammond 
officials said

rise dropped to 847 percent from 854 percent late thursday 
the spurt came after the commerce department said the gross 
national product the countrys total output of goods and services 
grew at an annual rate of just 12 percent from april through june 
economists said the report gave further impetus to a belief the 
economy is sliding into a recession 
additionally gnp secondquarter increase followed a revised 17 
percent increase in the first quarter and a barely discernible 03 
percent advance in the octoberdecember period last year 
slower growth increases the likelihood that inflation will be 
mild which increases the value of fixedincome investments such as 
treasury bonds 
kevin flanagan money market economist for dean witter reynolds 
inc said the rise in bond prices was restrained partly by an 
inflation measure in the gnp report that was higher than expected 
inflation erodes the value of bonds 
also some economists tempered their enthusiasm for the gnp 
number arguing it was weaker than it would be after government 
revisions in coming months 
mike casey an international economist with ramirez capital 
consultants inc said the gnp number was not bad enough to force 
the federal reserve to lower interest rates to spur the economy 
which would push bond prices higher 
trading activity was moderate 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments gained about point intermediate maturities rose 932 
point to 716 point and longterm issues were up as much as 1116 
point according to telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was 429 higher at 116431 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 777 percent as the

sixmonth bills dropped to 779 percent as the discount declined 5 
basis points to 741 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 779 
percent from thursdays auction as the discount tumbled 7 basis 
points to 727 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest banks charge each other on 
overnight loans was quoted at 8 percent unchanged from late 
thursday

eli lilly amp co maker the 
antidepressant drug prozac is among five defendants in lawsuits 
brought by the widows of three men slain in a bloody rampage last 
year at a printing company 
joseph wesbecker killed himself after fatally shooting eight 
coworkers at standard gravure corp on sept 14 twelve other 
shooting victims survived 
wesbecker was on longterm disability leave from his pressmans

drug and seek 50 million from the company 
the federal drug administration says prozac is the most widely 
prescribed antidepressant on the us market former users of the 
drug have said it drove them to violent tendencies including 
suicidal and homicidal thoughts 
last month a new york woman sued lilly for 150 million 
claiming she suffered severe side effects after taking the drug 
edward west spokesman for eli lilly said that of the 2 million 
users of prozac wesbeckers was the first report of violence he 
noted that wesbecker also had a history of psychiatric problems 
prior to using prozac 
it would not appear that prozac caused this behavior he 
said 
after the shootings a sixmember coroners jury concluded that 
excessive stress in the workplace and possibly the effects of 
psychiatric drugs were factors that contributed to the shooting 
also named as defendants were shea communications the owner of 
standard gravure hall security service inc which provided 
security guards to standard gravure the estate of joseph 
wesbecker and dr lee coleman the psychiarist who was treating 
wesbecker 
each suit seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages
