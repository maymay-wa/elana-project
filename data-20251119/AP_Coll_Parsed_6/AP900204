radiation safety experts checked a soviet 
cargo plane saturday after crew members reported canisters 
containing radioactive uranium hexafluoride might have broken open 
no leak was found officials said 
state safety officials and the portland fire bureaus hazardous 
materials team checked for radiation for more than two hours aboard 
the antonov 124 which landed at portland international airport 
shortly before 1 pm said doug roberts a spokesman for the port 
of portland 
the material was then turned over to the company that contracted 
to bring it into the united states roberts said 
ray paris a radiation safety officer with the oregon health 
division said the 11 soviet crew members became concerned when 
they spotted a milky white liquid collected on the floor under the 
nine canisters after the airplane landed 
paris said uranium hexafluoride is a white powder when mixed 
with water it gives off a vapor that can be fatal he said 
he said emergency crews checked the crew for respiratory 
problems then checked two customs agents crew members and the 
airplane for radioactivity 
all tests were negative paris said 
he said experts determined the liquid formed as condensation on 
the outside of the canisters and froze during the flight it melted 
as the airplane landed and dripped onto the floor mixing with dust 
or dirt to form the milky white substance paris said 
uranium hexaflouride is a chemical compound formed when uranium 
ore is treated with sulfuric acid to extract uranium oxide roberts 
said the material was bound for a processing center in washington 
state to be made into fuel for nuclear power plants

mayor sidney barthelemy won a second term in 
a primary election saturday over a white challenger after a 
campaign marked on both sides by accusations of racebaiting 
in complete but unofficial returns bathelemy had 79995 votes 
or 55 percent to 65047 or 44 percent for his fellow democrat 
donald mintz two other candidates split the remaining 1 percent 
barthelemy new orleans second black mayor smiled broadly as 
he took the podium for a victory statement but became more serious 
as he called for new orleans to join together after a divisive 
campaign 
we are in difficult times we have laid the foundations for 
the future but we cannot build a great city divided he said 
we all must work together 
barthelemy 47 did not announce victory until his 46yearold 
opponent an attorney who had never before run for office conceded 
defeat 
sidney to you congratulations and best wishes if permitted 
i look forward to working with you in the days ahead mintz told 
supporters at another hotel 
barthelemy avoided a runoff by winning more than half the vote 
ed renwick who was barthelemys pollster and wwltvs analyst 
said mintz needed 80 percent of the white vote and 20 percent of 
the black vote but got about 75 percent of the white vote and 15 
percent of the black 
turnout was predicted at 55 percent to 60 percent of new 
orleans 237000 registered voters more than 54 percent of whom 
are black 
recent polls showed barthelemy had erased mintzs early lead and 
was about a dozen percentage points ahead 
herman j buster bustamente a democrat and black 
businessman rudy e mills sr an independent also ran 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
greater than 
barthelemys easygoing conciliatory style contrasted with the 
hardhitting intensity of mintz who resigned as head of the citys 
dock board to make the race 
mintz and barthelemy denied the allegations of racebaiting and 
called them evidence that the other side was losing and desperate 
for an issue 
barthelemy who was louisianas first black state senator and 
city councilman at large since reconstruction accused mintz of 
being behind fliers depicting barthelemy as an uncle tom one shows 
him with a halfwhite face the other shows him robbing the grave 
of the late ernest dutch morial new orleans first black mayor 
mintz who is jewish and wears a lapel pin showing black and 
white hands interlinked vehemently denied the allegations 
boasting of a strong civil rights record including an urban league 
award to his law firm 
the mayor who said he wanted to bring people together has 
sought to divide them mintz said 
he said some of barthelemys radio advertisements catered to 
antiwhite racism and he accused the mayor of antisemitic 
campaigning because of a flier saying mintzs civil rights 
credentials apparently did not apply to blacks 
barthelemy called the antisemitism allegation ridiculous 
noting that he has appointed jews and received a bnai brith award 
despite the sharp disagreements the campaign drew relatively 
little attention as it competed with the christmas holidays a 
record freeze the sugar bowl and the super bowl 
there was never much interest in the issues the citys high 
crime rate unemployment which was above 10 percent for much of 
1988 before falling to 69 percent in december 1989 and the 
candidates experience and competence 
until late in december most of the interest was focused on 
morial who served from 1978 to 1986 and was widely expected to run 
until dec 14 when he announced that he would not 
from then until his death dec 23 interest centered on whether 
he would endorse either mintz a protege of his or barthelemy who 
often battled with him when barthelemy was a city councilman

the us invasion of panama has once 
more raised the issue of whether the united states will maintain a 
military presence beyond the year 2000 when the american bases 
must close 
president guillermo endara has abolished gen manuel antonio 
noriegas military leaving open the question about who would 
defend the panama canal endara has made no public statement about 
the issue of the bases 
the newspaper panama america newspaper recently suggested the 
uspanama treaties be renegotiated to allow american payments in 
exchange for keeping american military bases the 1977 treaties 
provide for the possibility of new agreements on defense of the 
waterway 
some panamanians believe the united states must continue to 
handle the canals security after the year 2000 
the spanishlanguage newspaper said the optimum benefit of 
leasing the bases would be the possibility of charging rent even 
before the year 2000 although panama collects no rent from the 
united states the us bases mean nearly 100 million a year for 
panamas economy in services purchased and other expenditures 
some panamanian military sources say the 58mile canal is 
indefensible because of the immense territory it covers and that 
the united states would need only a token security force 
some us military sources say the united states might maintain 
howard air base just outside of panama city and the rodman naval 
base 
the treaties did away with the old panama canal zone a 10mile 
stretch across the country along the canal that was us territory 
and stipulate that the canal will be turned over to panama on dec 
31 1999 when the last american soldier is to go home 
us bases have been in panama since the beginning of the 
century the united states now maintains 10 military installations 
in panama as part of the southern command with 12000 soldiers 
another 12000 were sent in during the invasion 
panamanians who approved the treaties in a plebiscite organized 
by former dictator omar torrijos do not dare ask for a revision of 
the treaties for fear of sounding antinationalist the topic was 
taboo before the us invasion dec 20 
the united states said it invaded and toppled noriega because 
his government had become a threat to us interests and the 
operation of the canal and to bring him to trial on us 
drugtrafficking charges 
noriega claimed the us government wanted to get rid of him 
because he opposed us plans to renege on the treaties and 
maintain its large military installations in panama 
the united states does not want to appear as if it is going back 
on its word it has said repeatedly that it intends to abide by the 
treaties 
i personally do not feel that the united states needs a large 
military presence in panama after the year 2000 said one us 
army officer who has been in panama for years 
a large military presence when the world situation is 
changing could be a political liability for the united states 
he said speaking on condition he not be idenfitied the united 
states would be criticized as an expansionist power 
maj gen marc cisneros commander of us army south the 
ground forces in charge of protecting the canal says the united 
states will meet its obligations to leave on schedule 
it is the intention of the united states to fully comply with 
the canal treaties cisneros said 
cisneros emphasized the new panamanian government if it 
maintains a democratic system will be able to run the canal as 
efficiently as we have 
when endara abolished noriegas military forces he established 
in the national police in their place 
last month as stipulated by the agreements a panamanian became 
adminstrator of the panama canal commission the us federal 
agency that adminsters the canal about 30 ships daily use the 
canal

armenian negotiators broke off informal peace 
talks with azerbaijanis and headed home sunday after accusing them 
of pressuring armenians to evacuate two villages in azerbaijan a 
participant said 
armenian leaders also instructed their negotiators in riga 
latvia that the armenian allnational movement had refused to 
ratify an agreement to seek a peaceful settlement of the conflict 
and exchange information on hostages 
the talks held without the participation of the soviet 
government began friday with mediators from the peoples fronts 
movements in the western republics of latvia estonia and 
lithuania direct talks followed on saturday 
everything went well until there was a pause in the talks 
then the leaders of the armenian allnational movement in yerevan 
told the negotiators to cut the talks said ints upmacis a 
latvian peoples front leader present during the meeting 
the armenians headed for yerevan early sunday upmacis said in a 
telephone interview 
the armenian political movement in yerevan accused the 
azerbaijan peoples front of pressing armenian residents to 
evacuate the villages of azad and kamo in the khanlar region of 
azerbaijan the official news agency tass reported 
the residents were told they were in danger of being attacked 
and the armenians claimed the army said it was unable to guarantee 
their safety upmacis said 
the armenian national movement board does not find it possible 
to continue joint consultations in riga a statement issued by 
the movements press center in yerevan said joint consultations 
and talks can be possible in the future only on condition of the 
termination of such actions 
when informed that the armenians were planning to leave the 
talks the azerbaijani negotiators agreed to try and verify the 
armenian claim but communist party officials and soviet army 
officials reached in the azerbaijani capital of baku said they had 
no information to support the charges 
the azerbaijani delegation said it was ready to resume talks 
with the armenians and departed for a meeting of representatives of 
prodemocracy groups in the lithuanian capital of vilnius upmacis 
said 
leaders of the azerbaijani peoples front in baku could not be 
immediately reached to comment on the armenian decision to break 
off the talks

republics for two years following armenias demand for annexation 
of nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian enclave located 
inside azerbaijan 
the latest round of violence began jan 13 resulting in the 
deaths of at least 214 people and the evacuation of thousands of 
ethnic armenians who lived in azerbaijan 
the soviet army marched into baku on jan 20 in response to the 
violence and the volatile developments prompted leaders of the 
three baltic fronts to propose peace talks out of concern that the 
conflict could jeopardize their own peaceful drive for democracy 
and independence in the baltics 
tass said extremist elements in the azerbaijani peoples front 
continued to disrupt efforts of the communist party the army and 
other bodies to stabilize the situation in baku 
during the weekend extremists using two armored personnel

police say christopher morris plotted 
with his parents to kill his exwife to collect 35000 in 
insurance when they found out the policy had lapsed authorities 
allege the parents killed him instead to collect a 70000 
policy 
theron and leila mary morris transplanted snowbirds from 
detroit with a poodle named pepe kept a welltended yard in their 
mobile home community they were regular churchgoers friendly 
quick to lend a hand with yardwork 
and theyre charged with murder accused of killing their 
42yearold son in a deadly doublecross 
police say the morrises schemed with their exconvict son to 
kill his former wife sharon and her 10yearold daughter for the 
insurance but they turned on their son after they learned that 
coverage had lapsed authorities say 
the morrises also were angry their son sold them bogus cocaine 
for 1000 that they had intended to resell investigators say 
the couple and martin rector their sons roommate and onetime 
prison buddy who is accused of being the triggerman then conned a 
drifter with drinking and blackout problems into confessing to the 
crime police say the drifter 40yearold john woods was 
released from jail after the three others confessed wednesday 
ive been doing homicide for 12 years said sheriffs lt 
tom carney its the strangest most coldblooded murder ive 
ever seen it seems they were upstanding citizens never had a 
brush with the law they look just like any other grandparents you 
would find any place in the country 
the morrises lawyer douglas lambeth says a different story 
will emerge in court that the morrises were afraid of rector and 
went along out of fear 
they talked to police lambeth acknowleged thats 
unfortunate for them but its not admissible in court i tell my 
clients that the fish would still be swimming in the ocean if they 
kept their mouths shut 
the alleged murder scheme stunned residents of the morrises 
mobile home community north of fort lauderdale 
they were good neighbors said john brennan a retired 
school administrator from binghamton ny he was a good church 
member when we returned in winter with all that yardwork he was 
the first one to come over and help you clean up 
theron morris 76 a retired chrysler corp engineer and his 
wife 62 who worked for united air lines for 23 years moved to 
florida four years ago 
their son was released from prison late last year after serving 
time on drug and assault charges neighbors said the morrises were 
trying to help him overcome a cocaine habit they housed him fed 
him bought him a car and found him a place to live but there was 
tension 
there was arguing yelling it was kind of like a family 
feud said michael kern 23 who lives across the street dorothy 
brennan another neighbor recalled theron morris ordering his son 
out of the house and telling him not to return 
police say chris morris and rector hatched a scheme to kill 
sharon morris and her daughter the two later recruited the elder 
morrises police say 
but when rector went to sharon morris house to kill her posing 
as a flower delivery man she wouldnt come to the door because 
rector was not in uniform said carney 
then police say the plotters discovered that a 35000 
insurance policy on sharon had lapsed so the target of the murder 
plot shifted to chris who was insured for 70000 
on the evening of jan 8 the younger morris went with rector to 
his parents home once there police say rector pulled out a 
38caliber revolver with a silencer and ordered morris to the 
floor morris father then bound him with duct tape and helped load 
him into the back seat of the car but chris morris broke free and 
was shot three times by rector 
they chased chris and told him they would take him to the 
hospital but instead they took him to the nearby town of coconut 
creek shot him three more times and left him in the car police 
said detectives said mrs morris followed in another car picked 
up her husband and rector and took them home 
chris body was found the next day the morrises told neighbors 
he was killed by drug dealers 
leila morris came over and put her arms around me and cried 
and cried recalled mrs brennan sharon morris attended her 
exhusbands funeral unaware she had once been a target 
the morrises housed and fed rector after chris death gave him 
an alibi for the night and said their son had gone out for beer and 
cigarettes but police immediately suspected rector and said that 
under questioning rector and the morrises implicated each other 
then ultimately confessed 
the insurance money has not been paid 
carney said what struck him most was the way the morrises 
described the events they indicated that they had a rough life 
with him the lieutenant said they figured they could get rid 
of the problem child and pick up 70000 
but neither of them showed any remorse any remorse about all 
of the details it was almost like they were talking about 
strangers

for the 7000 residents of this 
turnofthecentury paper mill town the outcome of a corporate 
battle they dont pretend to understand is in the hands of business 
executives they dont know 
georgiapacific corp has made a 38 billion bid for great 
northern nakoosa corp whose mill is the biggest employer in this 
remote northern town since the takeover battle began in october 
the paper giants have made promises and engaged in mudslinging to 
try to win the favor of mainers 
but the citizens of millinocket dont know who to root for 
do i believe either one of them no said fredericka 
boynton whose grandfather father husband and son worked in the 
mill i think theyre big corporations and playing that merger 
game and i dont think were going to win 
people in the area have been pulled by their heartstrings 
said money mcgibbon whose husband worked at the mill for 33 years 
theyre just being tugged from one end to the other and its not 
fair 
atlantabased georgiapacific has accused great northern of 
financially starving millinocket to the point where the aging mill 
may not have a future 
if it wins the fight georgiapacific says it will spend more 
than 1 million to determine whether it is feasible to make toilet 
paper paper towels and paper napkins in millinocket instead of 
paper used in books telephone directories and the like 
the mill built in 1900 employs about 900 people and 
georgiapacific says a tissuemaking operation could employ 215 
the company said it does not have enough information on the great 
northern mills and woodlands to make commitments about the 
remaining jobs 
great northern based in norwalk conn but incorporated in 
maine has claimed georgiapacific has a secret plan to sell the 
millinocket operations as well as a newsprint mill in nearby east 
millinocket and 21 million acres of maine woodlands 
georgiapacific denies the accusation 
great northern has promised 25 billion in improvements for 
maine georgiapacific calls that a pipe dream 
at a meeting last month georgiapacific executives tried to 
show their company would be a good corporate citizen but 
townspeople wondered how life would change in this company town 
where great northern once meant a secure job 
residents acknowledged that great northern has put more effort 
and money into building up its southern mills in recent years 
employment has been cut in millinocket 
before the problems started with great northern you could go 
to school here and have a job for life at good wages said 
retiree francis larkin who spent his life working for the mill 
the times when they helped us put in the foundations of our 
homes are gone said robert boynton mrs boyntons husband a 
retired great northern mechanical supervisor 
boynton said great northern still lends tools to those in need 
if you want a paint brush you can borrow a paint brush if i 
need a couple of jacks id go in and see the plant engineer he 
said ive never known them to refuse anybody theyll let you 
borrow anything 
retirees worry about their benefits if the mill changes 
ownership and a georgiapacific executive acknowledged at the 
meeting that he had no answers union leaders and rankandfile 
workers worry that jobs could be lost if the merger goes through 
this is all we have got is the great northern paper co and 
thats all we have known for years mrs mcgibbon said were a 
little bit leery of someone we dont know

solidarity leader lech walesa said sunday 
he probably will step down in april as leader of the union he 
founded as a shipyard electrician and ultimately led into the halls 
of government 
walesa 46 who has served as leader of the east blocs first 
independent trade union since its founding in 1980 made the 
statement during a speech before 1000 supporters after a mass in 
his home city of gdansk 
at one point during the rally at st brygidas church walesa 
was interrupted by heckling from a group of about 50 young radicals 
walesa has often spoken about his desire to retire from the 
burdens of the union some people around him suspect he is 
preparing to make a bid for polands presidency replacing gen 
wojciech jaruzelski if polands constitution is altered this year 
requiring new presidential elections 
i am publicly saying that i will not run for leadership at the 
regional congress scheduled this week in gdansk and most 
probably at the national congress either walesa said 
he had told a news conference thursday that he was tired of 
his activity and would like to rest for at least two years but he 
stressed then that if radicals threatened to take over solidarity 
he would stay in the job 
solidaritys national congress is to meet in april in gdansk 
the gathering will be only the second in solidaritys history the 
union managed to hold one congress in september and october 1981 
before it was suppressed in the martiallaw crackdown 
walesa led the union into a series of talks with the communist 
government that led to the union relegalization last year its 
participation in elections and then ultimately control of the 
government 
since it was legalized its membership has reached about 2 
million or only onefifth of its 1981 strength 
regional congresses have been held in various cities over the 
past two months to select delegates to the national congress 
after walesa made his comments about not running for union 
leadership some of the young radicals applauded and began 
chanting solidarity without walesa 
the radicals represented the confederation for an independent 
poland the federation of fighting youth and a selfstyled group of 
anarchists 
the protesters using a bullhorn accused walesa of limiting 
democracy one of the youths shouted if you continue like this 
you will end up like ceausescu a reference to nicolae ceausescu 
of romania who was overthrown in a violent revolt last year and 
executed 
asked by spectators about his opinion on the daylong takeover of 
gdansk province communist party headquarters last weekend by a 
similar group of radicals walesa said 
this is not the right way every government will use force in 
the face of anarchy and danger and must do so if there is a threat 
to the state or the city then i will get up myself with my belt 
and beat you 
you cannot play with poland you have to build it he said 
if we continue with such methods we will get no where because 
some general may explode and take advantage of the situation

in a rare public comment from his enforced 
seclusion author salman rushdie appealed to moslems on sunday to 
reconsider their opposition to the satanic verses saying he 
feels their pain but cannot retract his book 
in a 7000word essay which he said was the hardest piece of 
writing he had ever done rushdie said he never intended to 
blaspheme islam and regrets the racial tensions that followed the 
novels publication 
but rushdie also wrote in the independent on sunday that moslems 
who burned his books and staged violent demonstrations were partly 
responsible rushdie criticized the british government for not 
prosecuting a moslem leader who reportedly advocated his death 
rushdie a naturalized briton who was born into a moslem family 
in india has been in hiding under british police guard since feb 
14 1989 when iranian ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for 
rushdies death 
the decree was not lifted when khomeini died in june 
reaching out to the great mass of ordinary decent 
fairminded moslems rushdie said he recognized that many of them 
were shocked and pained by his book just as he was hurt by their 
rejection of it 
he asked them to renounce blood not to let moslem leaders 
make moslems seem less tolerant than they are 
perhaps a way forward might be found through the mutual 
recognition of that mutual pain he suggested 
his olive branch was rejected by liaqat hussain general 
secretary of the council of mosques in bradford northern england 
which has led the campaign to ban the satanic verses 
mr rushdie has suffered no pain it is moslems who have lost 
their lives and suffered injuries hussain said six people were 
killed in india and pakistan during demonstrations against the book 
i would not go into hiding for my beliefs he should be 
brave enough to face the world for his principles hussain added 
sundays essay was rushdies fullest defense of his book and 
account of his predicament since he went into hiding although he 
has given a handful of interviews and referred to his plight in 
book reviews 
saying he regretted that the book caused offense rushdie added 
would i have written it differently if i had known what would 
happen truthfully i dont know would i change any of the text 
now i would not its too late 
rushdie said the british government should have prosecuted kalim 
siddiqui who reportedly urged moslems meeting in manchester 
northern england to raise their hands if they agreed with 
khomeinis death sentence 
i find it upsetting that its seen to be all right for people 
to go around the country calling for my death rushdie wrote 
moslem leaders have repeatedly attacked prime minister margaret 
thatchers government for refusing to ban the book or prosecute 
rushdie 
the independent on sundays literary editor blake morrison 
reported that rushdie looked healthy and relaxed when they met 
at an undisclosed location in england on wednesday for a separate 
interview 
rushdie said that in hiding he missed most the ordinary things 
not being able to walk down a street not being able to browse in 
a bookshop not being able to go to a movie 
he said at times he could not work but now his writing is going 
well including a childrens book essays and the synopsis for a 
novel 
he said he watches a lot of television and has become an 
addict of american football broadcast in britain late at night

for the sixth consecutive year the republican 
administration in washington has proposed cutting off all subsidy 
for amtrak passenger rail service 
and congress for the sixth straight year is expected to refuse 
to go along 
president bush last week carried on a longstanding tradition 
established by his predecessor by proposing to cut the federal 
amtrak subsidy the move would leave amtrak about 28 percent shy of 
what it says it needs to operate for fiscal 1991 
legislators in the northeast accuse bush of ignoring the 
progress amtrak has made in reducing its dependence on federal 
money and of pursuing a policy that will lead to more crowded 
highways and airports 
its a terrible decision said rep bruce morrison dconn 
with the amount of money that is to be saved compared to the 
extraordinary public investment thats already gone into improving 
the rail infrastructure its really penny wise and pound 
foolish 
of amtraks 19 billion budget this year 600 million was 
supplied by the federal government in 1981 the federal government 
supplied about half of amtraks budget 
were talking about one b2 worth of expenditures morrison 
said 
new england is one of the heavy beneficiaries of the 
quasipublic rail line established in 1970 by congress to replace 
failing private lines 
in connecticut amtrak carries 12 million passengers per year 
and employs 727 state residents on a payroll of 25 million 
according to amtrak statistics some 422000 rhode island 
passengers use the system each year and amtrak employs 295 
residents on 10 million in payroll 
and in massachusetts where amtrak also is responsible for 
commuter service 14 million passengers use the amtrak system 
along with 14 million commuters per year amtrak employs 1710 
massachusetts residents and spends 55 million in payroll 
federal railroad administration spokeswoman claire austin said 
the administration opposes a subsidy but she said bush strongly 
supports rail transportation and she indicated there was no reason 
to believe the scenario played out in previous years would change 
weve always requested no subsidy and congress always makes an 
appropriation austin said 
unlike president reagan austin said bush supports federal 
spending for research into highspeed rail technology equipment 
and safety standards 
thats a different twist that you have not seen in the reagan 
administration according to austin 
rep christopher shays rconn predicted congress would again 
disagree with the president on the amtrak subsidy issue but shays 
said congress has the same goal we will wean amtrak from federal 
subsidies and well appropriate a little less 
according to amtrak a gradual reduction in federal subsidies 
could be accomplished without cutting into rail service 
weve said publicly and its mentioned in the presidents 
budget that amtrak has a goal of being selfsufficient for 
operational costs by the year 2000 said amtrak spokesman 
clifford black the rail line will still need at least 150 million 
per year for capital improvements black said 
for now morrison said amtrak depends on federal subsidies for 
survival and so does the regions transportation system 
in the northeast corridor the last thing we need to do is 
dump more cars and more air traffic into an already congested 
system morrison said

authorities arrested 70 members of the 
outlawed nepali congress party as it prepared to launch a campaign 
demanding that political organizations be legalized in nepal a 
party spokesman said sunday 
reports of harassment of other activists have been pouring in 
from local districts and in some places authorities have succeeded 
in stopping the partys activities spokesman daman dhunganahe said 
speaking at a news conference at party headquarters he said the 
arrests had been made in 10 of the countrys 75 districts but so 
far no action had been taken against party activists in katmandu 
the capital 
the leftist party banned 29 years ago decided recently to 
launch a nationwide campaign next week to demand restoration of a 
multiparty system 
the congress party was voted into power in 1959 but was 
overthrown 18 months later in a royal takeover 
the countrys westernstyle parliament was dissolved and nepal 
adopted its present panchayat policy which bans all political 
parties candidates elected to a national assembly must run as 
independents 
the assembly elects a prime minister from among its members and 
a council of ministers which advises the king a powerful figure 
in nepal who has the authority to declare a state of emergency or 
suspend the constitution 
denouncing the congress partys planned campaign prime minister 
marich man shrestha declared last month that the panchayat system 
is committed to ensure that all citizens enjoy equal civil rights 
in an unhindered fashion 
he said the party was trying to force its version of democracy 
on nepal when there already exists a working democracy in the 
country

the nations burgeoning pension system owns a 
huge chunk of corporate america but the benefits go to almost 
everyone but the retirees the funds are set up to serve 
typically described as a nest egg for millions of working 
americans pension funds also are being used to make a fast buck 
for stock brokers pay off corporate debt and even pressure some 
corporations into having social consciences 
the pension system buoyed by the bull market of the 1980s has 
grown into an economic force rising from just 7 billion in assets 
in 1950 to 2 trillion today about half that money is invested in 
stocks with pension funds holding 25 percent of total equity in 
the us economy 
the multibilliondollar investments make pension funds and 
those who manage them major players on wall street 
its not the retirees who are getting this money its the 
investment managers or traders or owners says karen ferguson 
director of the pension rights center a public interest group 
documents and about two dozen interviews indicate that the basic 
goal of the pension laws enacted by congress to protect and 
benefit the retirees has been eroded by the power pensions can 
broker on the stock market 
robert monks the head of the washingtonbased pension 
consulting firm institutional shareholder services joined other 
experts in saying investment managers are pushed by all sides to 
make a quick profit in fact there appears to be a growing move by 
pension funds to put equity managers on performancebased fees 
this encourages shortterm trades that garner commissions for 
brokers and the companies hope new assets for the funds 
the 1974 employee retirement income security act known as 
erisa says all investments must be made to benefit the pensioners 
but the windfall made with pension fund assets rarely reaches the 
retiree 
companies are allowed to skim off profits through a maneuver 
known as reversions and they are under no obligation to boost 
benefits when the funds prosper 
all the increased volatility on the stock market system with 
pension plans hasnt contributed to value for the beneficiaries 
monks said the people who are making money are the brokers 
consultants investment managers youre not making money for the 
people youre supposed to be 
texaco for example nabbed 3609 million in pension surpluses 
shortly after merging with getty oil co in 1984 occidental 
petroleum skimmed off 238 million from the pensions of its 
acquisition cities service 
most pension plans provide a monthly income after retirement 
based on a portion of wages earned during the later years of 
service in most cases the basic benefits are neither boosted when 
investments do well nor decreased when they do not 
some big businesses however do provide ad hoc 
costofliving increases at the discretion of management 
owensillinois inc of toledo ohio is one such company 
ronald c boller the companys vice president and director of 
benefit finance says it provides periodic benefit increases to its 
pensioners but the increases are not directly related to the stock 
market where 70 percent of owenillinois pension fund assets are 
invested 
and boller acknowledges that weve had a hell of a run in the 
markets where most of the money is invested 
formally technically the obligation of the company the 
pension promise exists whether the market goes up down or 
sideways he says 
ms ferguson is among those who say the full surpluses should be 
passed on to the retirees adding even at low inflation rates 
the value of a retirees benefit will be cut in half in a lifetime 
without a costofliving adjustment 
michael s gordon a washington pension lawyer and contributor 
to the erisa law argues that reversions amount to pension 
barbarism 
but proponents of reversions say the companies deserve the money 
as a reward for managing the investments well 
what happens when the market goes bad the employer is stuck 
with the liability said new york pension attorney jeffrey 
mamorsky 
that is only partially true if the employer is unable to pick 
up the pension tab it falls to the federal governments pension 
benefit guaranty corporation that agency has a 15 billion 
deficit and should it falter taxpayers ultimately could shoulder 
the responsibility 
some pension analysts also are concerned about a growing trend 
to use the financial clout of the funds on wall street to further 
social and political goals in their view such investment 
strategies however laudable the intent conflict with erisas 
mandate that the money be invested solely for the benefit of the 
pensioners 
this trend started about five years ago when many public funds 
those covering public employees called on their investment 
managers to get rid of stock in companies doing business in south 
africa pressure also has been placed on some companies to respond 
to environmental concerns 
the public pension funds in new york last year pushed exxon 
corp to put an environmentalist on its board after the valdez oil 
spill in alaska texaco last year also agreed to nominate a 
director from a list submitted by the california public employee 
retirement system 
gordon with a strict interpretation of the erisa law says 
woolyeyed social investment schemes should be avoided by 
private pension plans where the goal is to act on behalf of the 
retirees 
with public funds if they cant come through with the 
benefits then the state legislatures will do some kind of tax 
he said with private plans the employer is on the hook 
if his assets arent around to back it up then theres a crush 
on pbgc which already is in trouble

a teenage girl who was the first human 
recipient of a pioneering lung assist device remained in critical 
condition sunday at lds hospital 
the girl received the intravascular oxygenator an inchwide 
20inchlong bundle of plastic fibers that mimic the lungs task of 
supplying oxygen to the body during a twohour operation friday 
afternoon 
the hospital would report only the girls condition sunday a 
nursing supervisor who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
patients family insists that no further information about the girl 
be released the salt lake tribune reported that the girl is 16 
guidelines approved by the us food and drug administration in 
september limit the implants to seven days in people with acute 
respiratory failure who have little other chance of survival 
the ivox is designed to give damaged lungs a chance to rest and 
recover before it is removed its developer dr jd mortensen of 
salt lake city says while ivox cannot really be called an 
artificial lung it represents an important step toward eventual 
development of one 
implantation of the lung assist device involves insertion of the 
ivox via the neck or groin into the inferior vena cava the large 
vein that brings blood to the heart 
two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the ivox 
bundle consisting of 9001200 hollow porous fibers each about 
the diameter of a human hair and leave the body one delivers 
oxygen to theakkearold hoeflehner after edging atle 
skaardal of norway and franz heinzer of switzerland by 020 seconds 
the austrian with a faultless run completed the 3100meter 
distance in the winning time of 1 minute 4457 seconds 
hoeflehner who had won the second downhill race of his career 
in cortina in 1984 said sunday he avoided mistakes that relegated 
him to third place in a downhill on the same track saturday 
i concentrated on the bottom part which was the most 
difficult and i avoided the errors which had cost me victory 
yesterday hoeflehner said 
two consecutive downhills were raced here to make up for 
canceled events in chamonix and saalbach 
sundays victory the 10th of his career and following two wins 
in val disere last week strengthened hoeflehners lead in the 
world cup downhill standings and boosted his chances to win this 
years title 
the austrian has 131 points and with only two races left in 
this years competition holds a commanding lead over swiss 
allrounder pirmin zurbriggen second with 92 points 
zurbriggen who turned 27 sunday was sixth 
but he widened his world cup overall lead to 270 points 58 
ahead of norwegian ole kristian furuseth who did not start in the 
weekend races here 
helmut looked unbeatable today but i made a decisive mistake 
in the bottom part said zurbriggen shooting for a 
recordequaling fourth overall title before retiring in march 
he had placed fifth in saturdays race in which hometown 
favorite christian ghedina captured his first ever world cup 
victory ghedina was 15th sunday 
skaardal was satisified with his performance 
i fell short of a second victory but a second place is 
something good in a world cup race said skaardal who won his 
first ever downhill in kitzbuehel this year 
heinzer who was tied with skaardal in second place said he 
missed a big opportunity to win his first race since vail in 1988 
i made a few minor mistakes which still were decisive 
heinzer commented 
his teammate daniel mahrer second in saturdays race behind 
ghedina edged a late italian starter danilo sbardellotto for 
fourth place 
american aj witt who had skied to a fourthplace finish 
saturday was 36th in sundays race 255 seconds slower than the

the rev george stallings said sunday that his 
congregation in taking control of its own destiny by breaking 
ties with the roman catholic church would encourage the ordination 
of women and allow birth control and abortion 
stallings in defiance of church officials last summer formed 
the imani temple an independent africanamerican catholic 
congregation he announced his decision to break all ties with the 
vatican last week 
stallings said the departure from vatican authority would allow 
his congregation to set in place its own displine and laws which 
will govern our activites 
stallings after addressing his congregation of several hundred 
followers on sunday revealed some of those laws 
we will allow for the ordination of women and we will allow 
for divorced and remarried catholics to be in full communion 
without having to go through the tedious and potentially damaging 
annulment process he said in an interview we will also allow 
the use of birth control as well as allow women to decide whether 
or not to abort a life 
in addition he said the imani temple would permit optional 
celibacy which means our priests will be able to decide whether or 
not they want to marry 
stallings citing other occasions in which sects have broken 
away from the church expressed confidence that the lord would not 
abandon his church even if the vatican does in the form of 
excommunication 
just as god has been with other catholics in their declaration 
of independence from the catholic church he will be with us he 
told his congregation 
later he said excommunication in its truest sense means to 
be cut off from communion with god no church no pope no power 
can separate anyone from god because god will not allow that to 
happen 
he defended his churchs stance on birth control and abortion 
noting the bible has nothing to say about abortion or birth 
control the positions we are taking are not counterbiblical they 
are allowed within the expression of faith 
on the subject of ordaining women he said there is nothing 
in the bible that says women cant be ordained ministers we know 
from the scriptures that women are deaconesses if anything the 
scriptures advance the cause of women to the higher levels of 
ordination

the usually shy solitary raven turns out 
to be a gregarious bird in winter flocking to noisy feasts on 
carcasses that serve as traveling discos because they let male 
ravens strut their stuff a university of vermont zoologist says 
bernd heinrich who has donned a bear costume to try to get 
closer to the big black bashful birds gathered evidence for his 
book ravens in winter at his woodland cabin near mount blue 
state park in western maine 
after more than five years study and aided by a national 
science foundation grant heinrich wrote the first comprehensive 
study of interactions among the birds whose mysterious behavior has 
inspired centuries of folklore 
heinrichs work began when he observed about 15 ravens feasting 
noisily on a moose carcass near his cabin overlooking maines 
western mountains 
ravens are uncommon solitary creatures that usually fly alone 
or in pairs it seemed impossible to him that those birds and 
those he saw feeding at other carcasses in subsequent days each 
could have found the food individually 
he was forced to conclude that the ravens apparently were 
sharing their valuable winter food sources by recruiting complete 
strangers 
it was the most leftwing behavior i had ever heard of in a 
natural system the zoology professor wrote 
over the years heinrich hauled countless deer and moose 
carcasses donated by game wardens uphill to his retreat to be used 
as bait for his experiments 
his field work and studies of marked captive birds led him to 
theorize that vagrant birds mostly juveniles passing through an 
area yell to alert one another about newly discovered food 
that often is defended by a resident pair of adults 
because the vagrants continue to call others in to feed even 
after there are enough young birds present to overwhelm the adults 
heinrich says that the carcasses may also act as traveling 
discos where the birds can show off their bravery and ability to 
find food to potential mates 
heinrich believes that dominance is at the core of ravens 
social behavior in general he says the dominant birds tend to be 
males which are larger than females 
ravens are shy which is one reason there has been so little 
substantial research on them just the sight of an eyeball or the 
snap of a twig can send them soaring heinrich said 
that shyness once led heinrich to don a bear suit to see if he 
could get closer to his subjects he knew that the birds sometimes 
allow wolves or coyotes to feed next to them keeping a wary eye on 
their dinner guests but not flying away

journalist tony brown told a 
predominantly black audience that american blacks are crippled by a 
selfimposed psychological slavery that keeps them from 
achieving success 
brown said blacks are held captive by a myth if white america 
doesnt provide an opportunity for them they wont have one 
you are psychologically dependent on someone else brown 
told about 500 people at the annual fundraising dinner of the 
state chapters of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people on saturday night 
brown host of the black affairs television series tony 
browns journal said the civil rights movement has brought 
changes in laws that were needed to give blacks an equal footing 
but it takes more than legislation to reverse a 200yearold 
mindset of inferiority that plagues many in the black community 
brown said he urged blacks to take pride in their african identity 
and not wait for others to help them reach their economic and 
social goals 
if we want to be equal lets be equal he said we dont 
need anybody to give us freedom 
brown also writes a column that appears in 150 black newspapers 
publishes a quarterly magazine and produces documentary films

hundreds of thousands of cheering protesters 
filled the broad streets of the capital sunday to demand that the 
communists surrender their stranglehold on power perhaps the 
biggest protest in moscow since the bolshevik revolution 
the huge gathering came on the eve of a party central committee 
meeting during which president mikhail s gorbachev is expected to 
propose that other parties be allowed to compete for power a move 
likely to spur an intense struggle between hardliners and 
reformers 
the crowd waved huge whiteredandblue flags of 
prerevolutionary russia and held signs warning party officials to 
remember romania where a bloody revolt last year toppled the 
stalinist regime of nicolae ceausescu 
the masses stopped next to red square for gigantic rally that 
was meant to influence the pivotal communist party plenary meeting 
that opens monday 
this plenum is the partys last chance declared boris n 
yeltsin a populist communist leader who promised to place the 
crowds demands before the 251member central committee 
others harkening to the revolution that overthrew the czar in 
february 1917 before being swept away by lenin eight months later 
said a new revolution was under way 
long live the beginning of the peaceful nonviolent 
revolution of february 1990 historian yuri afanasiev told the 
cheering crowd 
some demonstrators at the head of the rally chanted politburo 
resign others whistled in derision when they passed the moscow 
city council headquarters on gorky street 
trucks blocked moscows garden ring road for the marchers who 
linked arms next to gorky park and completely filled eight lanes of 
traffic stretching back more than half a mile cordons of 
uniformed police blocked cars elsewhere turning the center of 
moscow into a virtual pedestrian mall 
in all the march and rally lasted for about five hours before 
participants began to disperse police observed the peaceful 
proceedings in the historic heart of the capital but there were no 
reports of any disturbances 
according to published reports party leader gorbachev will 
propose to the central committee that the party give up the 
guarantee of power that was written into the soviet constitution in 
1977 
the radio moscow news service interfax also said gorbachev was 
planning structural reforms that would reduce the size of the 
central committee and possibly eliminate the ruling politburo he 
also was expected to give tacit approval to the concept of private 
property 
the proposals are in the form of a draft platform to be placed 
before a congress theoretically the communist partys highest 
body that now is scheduled for this fall 
many moscow observers expected a concentrated effort from 
conservatives in the central committee to stop the reforms they 
believe have brought the soviet union to economic ruin and ethnic 
strife 
at least some in the crowd had doubts whether gorbachev is 
committed to radical reforms mikhail sergeyevich whom are you 
with one sign asked 
yeltsin and other reformers speaking to the crowd gathered in 
front of the moscow hotel from the back of a blue flatbed truck 
demanded that the party and government talk with them about the 
soviet unions future as communist leaders have been forced to do 
as changes have swept the former soviet satellites of eastern 
europe 
they also urged a day of similar rallies throughout the country 
on feb 25 yeltsin demanded that the party congress be held 
earlier in may or june 
the rally united reformers from the peoples front organizations 
of moscow and russia the association of moscow voters the 
memorial group dedicated to remembering the victims of stalin and 
other reformers 
it marked another step in a rapid solidification of the 
reformers movement they first came together two weeks ago to form 
a group calling itself the democratic platform 
we dont have any more time said nikolai i travkin a 
member of the congress of peoples deputies we dont have time 
for disagreements among ourselves 
reformers say they have been scared in recent weeks by the 
soviet military assault on baku the capital of the azerbaijan 
republic where a fierce nationalist movement has taken hold and 
threats of attacks on jews by russian nationalists 
we are for freedom but not the freedom of fascists were for 
freedom but not the freedom of murderers popular poet yevgeny 
yevtushenko declared 
democratic platform formally demanded removal of the communists 
constitutional guarantee on power and a virtual apology for decades 
of repression and mismanagement 
some of its leaders such as afanasiev say they are on the verge 
of declaring the party incapable of reform quitting it and 
forming a social democratic party 
small local parties are forming in the baltic republics where 
legislators already have acted to remove the communist partys 
monopoly on power but so far there is no nationwide opposition to 
communist authority 
gorbachev said in the baltic republic of lithuania last month 
that it would be no tragedy if a multiparty system evolved 
but he continues to insist that it is not a simple solution to all 
the countrys problems 
but reformminded economist gavriil popov also a deputy told 
the crowd that the communist party leadership was hindering reform 
we need a free society with a free economy a society of 
free people he said 
the soviet union ruled exclusively by the communists since a 
few months after the 1917 russian revolution is the last remaining 
warsaw pact nation to give the communists a guaranteed monopoly on 
power 
the twodaty central committee meeting is likely to be the last 
one before elections to governing councils in the 15 soviet 
republics and cities and towns most of which are scheduled to take 
place in the next month and a half 
top local party officials suffered embarrassing defeats in many 
cities in national elections in march and others could lose 
heavily in the local elections

albanias hardline communist party 
central committee plans to introduce some reforms as part of a 
cautious move away from total control of society albanias state 
ata news agency reported sunday 
the committee at a meeting jan 2223 reaffirmed its claim to 
power but agreed to give state enterprises more decisionmaking 
authority permit dual candidacies for some posts and tie wages 
more closely to production ata said 
such tentative moves toward democracy cannot be compared to the 
whirlwind of reforms that have swept communist parties from decades 
of rule in some east european countries and forced radical changes 
on others in the past few months 
but they are relatively major developments in the context of 
albania a closed society and the most conservative european 
communist nation for decades 
albania broke with the soviet union in 1961 over moscows policy 
of destalinization and with china in 1978 because of beijings 
perceived deviation from marxistleninist tenets 
the ata report added substance to reports of some shortages this 
winter saying the central committee session agreed that nothing 
can justify the shortage of vegetables milk and meat in every 
city 
the dispatch follows unconfirmed rumors in yugoslavia and greece 
of unrest in the albanian city of shkoder jan 11 and jan 14 with 
thousands of people reportedly trying to tear down a statue of 
josef stalin the late soviet dictator albanian officials denied 
the reports 
the central committee resolutions as reported by ata included 
opening up election to seats in parliament to more than one 
communistapproved candidate 
placing limits on the length of office for some party and 
government posts 
extending economic and financial planning from the center to 
the districts and from the districts to the enterprises 
cooperatives and institutions 
placing more emphasis on profitablity of state enterprises 
increasing the role of the collective garden small herds and 
plots in supplying the peasantry agricultural cooperatives 
can sell agricultural and livestock products at prices set by 
themselves different from the state 
the plenum condemned the counterrevolutionary process in 
the soviet bloc saying it resulted from the instigation and 
inteference of western reaction and of the soviet union 
at the same time it acknowledged popular support for the 
changes which it blamed on disillusionment with revisionist 
domination its bureaucracy and violence 
albanian leaders repeatedly have emphasized that the changes 
sweeping eastern europe will not affect their country stressing 
that albania has developed separately from the warsaw pact for the 
last 40 years

the americas cup the most valued prize in 
yachting sits in a most unusual trophy case these days a vault at 
the morgan guaranty trust co in new york city 
its there because of a legal fight that centers on 
sportsmanship fairness history and money 
new yorks highest court will decide in the coming weeks whether 
the 139yearold silver trophy goes to the san diego yacht club or 
to the mercury bay yacht club of new zealand 
mercury bay contends the san diego club and its skipper dennis 
conner cheated by using a catamaran in defeating the new 
zealanders 1988 challenge for the cup 
mercury bay contends that conner using the lighter and more 
maneuverable catamaran had an unfair advantage and violated the 
spirit of the centuryold rules that established the americas cup 
competition 
those rules say the new zealanders require holders of the cup 
to accept any challenge from any foreign country in a vessel 
similar to the one being used by the challenger 
mercury bay sailed in a 132foot fiberglass sloop and lost to 
conner in two consecutive races off san diego described by mercury 
bays lawyers as a gross mismatch 
a catamaran had never before been used in americas cup 
competition in court papers mercury bays lawyers quote malin 
burnham head ofthe syndicate that financed conners stars and 
stripes as saying a catamaran would turn this race into a 
farce 
the new zealanders want conners victory invalidated with the 
trophy awarded to them 
on the other side is the san diego yacht club and the americas 
cup organizing committee which plans to stage the next defense of 
the trophy 
they claim that conners catamaran was legal and that the new 
zealanders are going to court to get a prize they could not win in 
the water 
mercury bay also has the backing of the new york yacht club 
which had held the cup 132 years and 24 successful defenses until 
conner lost it to australia in 1983 conner sailing for san diego 
regained the cup in 1987 
the rules are contained in an 1887 document known as the deed 
of gift which set up the americas cup challenge system 
the deed established the new york court of appeals as the final 
arbiter of americas cup disputes this is the first time a dispute 
over the cup has reached the top court 
lower state courts were divided on the issue a trial court 
disqualified conner and gave the cup to new zealand but an appeals 
court reversed that decision and awarded the cup to san diego 
the case has also generated some ill will between the two sides 
peter debreceny spokesman for fay said the new zealanders are 
trying to prevent the americas cup from becoming commercialized 
he claimed conner and san diego wanted to hold on to the cup so 
they could hold a financially rewarding warmup for the 
americas cup off the coast of san diego in 1991 
officials for the americas cup organizing committee deny 
mercury bays accusation and say that they were willing to face all 
challengers 
at stake is more than a trophy the winner gets to host the next 
challenge tentatively scheduled for 1991 that could mean an 
economic boost for the host community americas cup matches bring 
spectators from around the world and considerable prestige for 
the owner of the winning yacht 
about two dozen countries including such yachting newcomers as 
yugoslavia and japan have asked to be among the challengers in 
1992 
i think once the legalities are over the cup will be stronger 
than ever said thomas mitchell chief spokesman for the 
organizing committee 
i think everyone is keen to see it sorted out so that 
sportsmanship in the end prevails in one form or another said 
debreceny 
a decision from the court of appeals could come by april until 
then the historic silver trophy 34 inches high and coveted by 
yachters worldwide will stay in its vault on fifth avenue

state radio broadcast a regular 
mass for the first time in four decades sunday and the official 
news agency said broadcasts of protestant jewish and other roman 
catholic services would follow 
in a separate dispatch the official ctk news agency announced 
officials from the new noncommunist government would meet kremlin 
officials in moscow wednesday for talks on withdrawing the 
estimated 75000 soviet troops from czechoslovakia 
the terse report did not specify the length of the second round 
of the sovietczechoslovak talks or who would be participating in 
them the first round in prague jan 1516 failed to provide 
tangible results 
archbishop frantisek vanak led worshipers through the mass in 
the church of st wenceslas in the northern city of olomouc 180 
miles east of prague 
the service was the first by czechoslovak radios department for 
religious programs which was formed after a popular revolution 
ousted the countrys hardline communist leadership and ushered in 
noncommunists who promised religious freedom 
this is a continuation of a beautiful tradition which was 
providing great help to those listeners who were not able to attend 
the services in a community of believers ctk said referring to 
the regular broadcasts before the 1948 communist takeover 
plans for other live broadcasts include services from other 
catholic churches protestant gatherings and from the jewish 
synagogue in prague ctk said 
at lany west of prague president vaclav havel met with the 
dalai lama and called on politicians around the world to respect

congressional investigators have unearthed 
additional information in the hud scandal and plan to resume 
hearings despite attorney general dick thornburghs request for a 
special prosecutor according to the chairman of the house panel 
however amid concerns about pursuing a separate investigation 
the committees chairman rep tom lantos dcalif announced 
sunday he was canceling an appearance at a hearing monday by one of 
the witnesses a former top hud official who has been cooperating 
with investigators 
lantos had said earlier that while he was pleased with 
thornburghs request for a prosecutor i disagree with him on the 
scope of the criminal investigation 
my subcommittee will continue to do its best to develop the 
issue lantos said in an interview friday 
we have unearthed additional information new information and 
this has prompted us to continue the hearings he said 
he declined to say what the new evidence involved 
thornburgh asked a federal court last week to appoint a special 
prosecutor to investigate former housing and urban development 
secretary samuel pierce and other former top hud officials 
thornburgh limited the request to the handling of one hud 
subsidy program however and ruled out a request by house 
judiciary committee members that the prosecutor look at potential 
perjury by pierce before the lantos panel last spring 
lantos committee which conducted more than 20 hearings last 
year into alleged fraud mismanagement and influencepeddling at 
hud during the reagan years was reopening its hearings monday 
lantos said his government operations subcommittee on employment 
and housing was scheduling more hearings too and that he has 
changed his mind since last fall when he told reporters it was time 
to wind down the congressional probe and turn the hud scandal over 
to the courts 
we clearly will do nothing that will interfere with the work 
of the independent counsel he said 
however the committee said sunday it was canceling the 
appearance of one of the scheduled witnesses former assistant 
housing secretary thomas demery 
jerris leonard demerys attorney said demery was prepared to 
testify but that he had been informed by the committee saturday 
afternoon that lantos wanted to cancel the appearance 
leonard said he was told lantos wanted to discuss with the 
independent counsel when he or she is appointed the question of 
whether or not mr demery should appear because he is at least a 
witness in the investigation of mr pierces activities 
demery could not be reached for comment sunday but on friday he 
said creation of the special prosecutor known under the law as an 
independent counsel had caused him to have second thoughts about 
agreeing to testify before the house panel 
i dont have a good handle on how to answer questions that are 
now going to be in the purview of the special prosecutor said 
demery who appeared voluntarily before the panel last year and has 
cooperated with investigators 
as a former top hud official demery acknowledged he could 
become an object of a special prosecutors investigation 
also scheduled to appear was carol crawford the former 
associate director of the office of management and budget who 
oversaw hud for the reagan white house and james hamernick former 
director of huds office of insured multifamily housing development 
hamernick was appearing under subpoena his attorney john 
mccahill informed the committee he would invoke a house rule 
allowing subpoenaed witnesses to ban cameras and microphones when 
he appears a step pierce and other witnesses took when invoking 
their constitutional rights to refuse to testify on grounds of 
selfincrimination 
demery was expected to face questioning about his dealings with 
pierce while at hud and pierces decisionmaking process 
congressional investigators continue to be interested in 
pierces assertion during his voluntary appearance last spring that 
he took no direct role in contract awards a point that was 
disputed in the subsequent testimony of other former hud officials 
congressional investigators want to question hamernick about his 
relationship with former pierce executive assistant lance wilson 
after leaving the department and becoming a housing specialist with 
the wall street firm of paine webber wilson filed expense accounts 
claiming he spent more than 1000 to entertain hamernick in a 
single month 
thornburgh called for an investigation of pierce and others in 
the awarding of grants under huds section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program which provided subsidies for developers to 
renovate housing for lowincome people 
additional witnesses including hud inspector general paul 
adams are set to appear before the panel tuesday in a hearing on 
alleged abuses at the passaic nj public housing authority

workers will remain in offices tabulating information and 
contacting folks by phone bitzer said 
he said a big hiring push will occur in march new workers will 
have about three days of training and will work daily with their 
supervisors to help resolve any problems during the count 
a census takers life can be anything but boring over the 
years the temporary workers have encountered births family fights 
and more than a few other unusual cases according to records kept 
by the bureau 
for example 
a census taker was helping jail inmates fill out forms when the 
guard was changed unable to convince the new shift that he didnt 
belong there the man stayed behind bars for several hours until 
the warden confirmed his identity 
a feeble voice from behind a closed door once asked a census 
employee to crawl in a window she did and found an 85yearold 
man lying helplessly on the floor he motioned her to the next 
room saying my census form is in there its all filled out 
she helped him into bed and called a doctor 
a worker once conducted an truly in depth interview with a 
man who was trying to set a world record for being buried alive 
a farmer told a census taker he just couldnt stop plowing to 
be interviewed so each time the tractor came around the farmer 
was shouted a question two hours later the form was completed but 
the census taker had a sunburn and a sore throat 
for tracking down the information the temporary census takers 
will earn 450 to 8 an hour and when on the road 24 cents a 
mile 
in past years many of the workers were housewives but that pool 
of workers has been declining in number and officials have 
increasingly had to turn elsewhere especially to retirees a law 
was enacted last year that keeps postal federal and military 
retirees from losing retirement benefits if they work as census 
takers for less than six months 
applicants can check on the availability of local census jobs 
through the 484 local census offices that have been opened and are 
listed under the us government in telephone directories or at 
state employment service offices

defense secretary richard cheney said sunday 
it makes no sense to cut major weapons programs despite 
political changes in communist countries because we have to deal 
with soviet military capabilities and not just intentions 
cheney defended president bushs proposed continued funding of 
the mx and midgetman missile programs as well as the level of 
proposed us troops cuts in europe 
congressional critics have said the two missile programs arent 
needed and more troops should be brought home 
intentions can change overnight and we have to deal with 
the soviets military capabilities and not just intentions 
cheney said on cbstvs face the nation program there is 
still enormous nuclear capability targeted against the united 
states and the soviets have provided no evidence they are prepared 
to change that cheney said 
cheney made his remarks on the eve of secretary of state james 
a baker iiis trip to moscow this week where he is scheduled to 
meet with soviet president mikhail gorbachev baker also is to meet 
with foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in hopes of laying the 
groundwork for a possible new arms reductions treaty president bush 
and gorbachev could sign this summer 
shevardnadze also is expected to respond more formally to bushs 
troop cut offer 
congressional leaders meanwhile suggested that deeper defense 
spending cuts are needed for the fiscal 1991 budget than the 
administration proposed last week and that the presidents rollback 
in the us military presence in europe does not go far enough 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
continued spending for the mx missile program wasteful and 
unnecessary 
i dont think theres any chance that the administrations 
proposal to fund both the mx and midgetman will be enacted 
said mitchell on nbctvs meet the press 
last week three former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff 
told a congressional hearing the administration should cancel plans 
to modernize its landbased nuclear missile force including the 
mx and midgetman if us soviet agreement is reached on a 
strategic weapons treaty 
the bush budget calls for 25 billion to place the us fleet 
of the 10warhead mxs on rail cars it also calls for a 202 
million for a new missile the truckbased singlewarhead 
midgetman 
it makes no sense for us unilaterally to cut those program 
when theres no military rationale for doing so argued cheney 
adding that the us response to developments in the soviet union 
and eastern europe should be limited to conventional weapons issues 
but cheney and white house chief of staff john sununu rejected 
deeper troop cuts than the presidents proposal bush proposed a 
cutting us combat forces in central europe from 255000 troops to 
195000 
mitchell said reductions to somewhere in the range of 
100000 should be pursued with the soviets house speaker tom 
foley dwash also predicted us troop strength would be 
something closer to 100000 than 195000 in a matter of a few 
years 
the game is always whatever the white house lays out they 
play call and raise on the hill sununu said 
foley and sununu made their remarks on abctvs this week with 
david brinkley 
on other matters 
cheney denied playing politics when assembling the list of 
us military bases marked for closing rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo said 90 percent of the bases listed for closing by the 
republican administration were in democratic districts but cheney 
said he was unaware of that when the list was compiled 
congressional leaders agree that the competition is intense 
for money from any socalled peace dividend 
noting the governments huge deficit foley said reduced defense 
spending may get us closer to paying our way and that there 
are many demands in social programs that also require funds 
for those who think the peace dividend will solve a lot of 
other problems theyve got to put it into perspective said sen 
pete domenici rnm noting the size of the federal deficit 
domenici the ranking republican on the senate budget committee 
also appeared on the brinkley program

at the british embassy here a day after rightwing graffiti was 
spraypainted on the building an embassy spokesman said

john sawyer a spokesman for the embassy said three shots were 
fired at the building about 230 pm no one was injured and the 
attackers fled in a vehicle he said

protection following the attack and it was considering seeking 
extra protection at its four other diplomatic offices in south

increasingly isolated in a christian 
enclave the rebel general michel aoun has become a cult figure 
hundreds of his loyalists have paid him homage daily at 
lebanons shellshattered presidential palace which he has turned 
into the home of the people 
children have smashed open their clay piggy banks at aouns feet 
while businessmen spill wads of banknotes from plastic bags to aid 
what many others see as a hopeless campaign to drive the powerful 
syrian army out of lebanon 
to the syrians and their allies aoun is someone whose lust for 
power not only blocks efforts to end lebanons 14yearold civil 
war but could unleash more bloodshed and destroy whats left of the 
country 
a clown a clever clown the druse moslem chieftain walid 
jumblatt called him 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem described him as 
nothing but a television show 
but aoun is a champion to the young people in the christian 
enclave ringed on three sides by hostile forces and by the 
mediterranean on the other 
an estimated half of the 1 million christians trapped inside the 
enclave support the general others like the rightwing 
phalangists and the lebanese forces militia oppose him 
since tuesday aoun has waged a savage offense in the christian 
enclave to crush the lebanese forces but so far has failed to do 
so at least 200 people have been killed and 900 wounded mostly 
civilians in the deadly fighting that has sent an estimated 
500000 people to basement bomb shelters 
before the most recent fighting young women at the ouragan 
night club in christian east beirut would flash vforvictory signs 
with their fingers as they danced and shout aoun aoun 
in other discos youngsters sang general general a paean 
of praise for aoun set to the tune of the little richard classic 
tutti frutti 
 
the arabiclanguage song ridicules rival christian and moslem 
leaders who endorsed an arab league peace plan in saudi arabia last 
october under which elias hrawi was elected president of lebanon on 
nov 24 
aoun whose 20000 soldiers control the enclave rejects the 
accord on grounds that it does not guarantee the withdrawal of the 
40000 syrian soldiers in lebanon 
they were deployed under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate aoun charges they betrayed that mandate by openly siding 
with the moslems and leftists 
all 45 foreign ambassadors accredited in lebanon have shunned 
aoun since hrawis election in november but the general pledges to 
continue the war of liberation he launched in march 1989 to 
drive out the syrians even though his forces are heavily 
outnumbered 
at least 929 people were killed and 2744 wounded before the 
guns were silenced by an arab league ceasefire sept 22 
hrawi who has officially removed aoun as lebanons army 
commander and interim prime minister wants the presidential palace 
so he can rule from the symbol of state authority aoun refuses to 
recognize hrawi as president or vacate the palace which is mostly 
in ruins 
some of aouns supporters look upon him with a religious fervor 
jesus christ is our savior in heaven and michel aoun is our 
jesus and our savior on earth a woman commented in a broadcast 
by aouns radio lebanon 
some maronite catholics even hold christenings and other church 
rituals in the palace courtyard strung with lights that spell out 
in arabic god bless our home 
the general has come up from his bunker two stories under the 
palace almost every day to deliver a political sermon to his 
followers 
his speeches delivered from behind an armored shield draped 
with the lebanese flag are often interrupted by shouts of syria 
get out and with our blood and souls we sacrifice ourselves to 
you o general 
when winter rains soak them supporters amend the chant with 
our flu we sacrifice ourselves to you 
aouns officers exhort the crowds to shout louder above the 
taped cheers blaring from loudspeakers while the tv cameras roll 
when it looked as if the syrians were going to attack baabda in 
october thousands of aouns young loyalists formed a human 
shield around the palace 
about 500 are still camping out in dozens of colored tents 
nestled among the trees around the palace 
with the winter weather the tents are mostly empty during the 
day but theyre crowded at weekends 
we stay up till dawn dancing said john who did not want 
his full name used because he often slips into west beirut the 
capitals moslem sector the best parties we have are the ones we 
hold here 
why shouldnt we party weve won the battle against the 
syrians he added seemingly oblivious to prospect of a possible 
military assault to dislodge aoun from the palace

lisa smith director of the washington airports task force said 
the names typically confuse visitors from the middle east and far 
east if theyre not enunciated clearly its hard to tell the

using aggressive tactics that included 
garnishing lottery winnings and putting liens on real estate banks 
and other lenders in three years doubled the money recovered from 
delinquent student loan borrowers a study showed sunday 
lenders in the guaranteed student loan program which has made 
higher education possible for more than 20 million americans since 
created by congress in 1965 introduced innovative procedures to 
forestall default and increase recoveries from 200 million in 
fiscal year 1986 to more than 400 million in fiscal year 1989 
the very magnitude of this program has created an urgent 
concern to prevent defaults and increase collections from borrowers 
who have run into trouble said pelavin associates a washington 
dc research firm that conducted three national studies on the gsl 
program for a consortium of guarantee agencies in colorado 
massachusetts tennessee texas and washington state 
government student loan programs have been harshly criticized in 
recent years because of spiralling huge default rates mainly among 
trade and vocational schools 
the gsl program which is administered by 56 guarantee agencies 
that protect private lenders against losses from loan defaults had 
516 billion in student loans entering repayment status in fiscal 
year 1988 
the federal government is the ultimate guarantor of the loans 
last year the education department announced it would try to 
collect more than 100000 defaulted student loans worth more than 
300 million these include loans that were made to borrowers who 
have never made a payment on their student loans and also loans to 
students who have not made a payment in the five years following 
their loan default 
according to the new studies eighteen guarantee agencies 
improved their recovery rates by more than 10 percent and 22 
agencies saw improvements between 5 percent and 10 percent 
half the agencies took problem borrowers to court while 20 
states got tough by withholding defaulters state income tax 
refunds eighteen states used outside collection agencies to 
supplement their own resources 
colorado garnished wages utah put liens on real estate texas 
and illinois did not renew professional licenses for doctors 
nurses lawyers and beauticians until their debts were resolved 
california garnished lottery winnings for a few defaulters lucky 
enough to win money 
a study on loan default reductions found that 48 out of 56 
guarantee agencies have reduced the percentage of loans in default 
since 1986 the federal government rewards low default rates by 
tying reimbursement allocations to an annual performance 
calculation known as the trigger rate twentynine of the 
guarantee agencies qualified for full reimbursement 
in other findings 
fourteen guarantee agencies used special procedures to 
disqualify troublesome proprietary schools during the past four 
years texas georgia and oklahoma limited the number of loans 
problem schools could process eleven states suspended proprietary 
schools and six states terminated schools permanently from the 
guaranteed loan program 
four actions were instituted against lenders lender violations 
included failure to follow administrative procedures inaccurate 
records and incorrect federal reporting

a political mentor to mayor tom bradley 
disputed allegations sunday that he used 336000 in federal 
poverty funds to renovate a dilapidated building he secretly owned 
the city council granted loans to bishop h hartford brookins 
who owned the building through a nonexistent corporation between 
1982 and 1985 in apparent violation of city bidding procedures and 
despite his refusal sometimes to provide financial information the 
los angeles times reported in sunday editions 
in addition a bradley aide repeatedly asked two city 
administrators to grant special help to the bishop city officials 
said 
in a telephone interview from virginia published sunday in the 
times brookins said the office complex initially was acquired by 
an arm of the african methodist episcopal church 
the property was in the name of the southern california 
conference ame church brookins said it does exist whether it 
is incorporated i dont know 
brookins said he will pay back the city any money he may owe 
but he insisted he has done nothing improper 
i know everything was done aboveboard and signed off by the 
city brookins said thats why im not shaking in my boots 
right now 
los angeles city council members said they will conduct an 
inquiry this week into city loans used to renovate the office 
complex to see if public funds were misused 
my basic question is whats going on how come we didnt know 
about it earlier councilman robert farrell said 
brookins former ame bishop in los angeles and now head of the 
church in virginia maryland and washington dc acknowledged 
that he now owns the office complex he said the african methodist 
episcopal church can have it back by paying him about 900000 that 
he owes on the property 
brookins received the loans through the citys community 
development department to renovate a rundown building complex for 
a jobs and education program 
later the city program was shifted to a dilapidated office next 
door while the refurbished building was leased for 10000 per 
month the complex was refinanced to net the bishop 250000 
bradley has refused to be interviewed about brookins but deputy 
mayor mark fabiani said that bradley is concerned about the 
allegations 
brookins headed bradleys first campaign for city council in 
1963 and has been chairman or cochairman of every bradley campaign 
since i mean literally if i may i almost handcarried bradley 
up his whole political career brookins said in a 1985 interview

el salvadoran president alfredo 
cristiani attracted dozens of protesters sunday when he went to 
harvard university apparently to watch his son play in a squash 
match officials said 
harvard spokesman peter costa said cristiani was in town for a 
private family visit 
costa said he was told cristianis son was a member of princeton 
universitys squash team which was playing harvard 
dozens of protesters opposed to el salvadoran military policies 
demonstrated outside the harvard gymnasium banging pots and pans 
earlier in the day protesters gathered outside the cambridge 
hotel where cristiani was staying 
the demonstrators brought letters from cambridge mayor alice 
wolf and from the cambridge belmont and arlington sister city 
projects 
the letters described how recent delegations that visited sister 
cities in el salvador reported continuing human rights abuses by 
the military 
in her letter wolf said children often have been the victims of 
military raids in cambridges sister city of san jose las flores 
our president george bush frequently justifies the military 
aid that our country sends your government on the grounds that you 
have at long last brought the armed forces of el salvador under 
democratic civilian control the letter said judging from 
their behavior towards san jose las flores this does not seem to

the police department has quotas limiting the 
number of drug arrests by individual officers to save overtime pay 
the daily news reported sunday 
the news said narcotics officers are ordered to stop making 
arrests for the rest of the month when they reach the unofficial 
35hour overtime limit which amounts to about three arrests 
police commissioner lee brown denied the report we do not 
stop making arrests at any point in time because of overtime 
brown said 
a guy can reach his 35 hours in the first week or two then 
sit around the rest of the month and do nothing the news quoted 
an unidentified narcotics officer as saying 
ive been told in a month when i had great felony arrests that 
i was going to be put on the telephone because im making too 
many arrests said another 
brown however said department policy merely supervises the 
distribution of the overtime it would not be correct if one 
officer received all the overtime and another officer did not 
receive any 
so its just a matter of management to insure that there is 
an equal work load

the white print shop owner whose 
property was searched by the fbi in its mail bomb investigation has 
belonged to the naacps local chapter for three years the 
chapters president said sunday 
but the attorney for brian joseph fleming 32 said that 
membership was not the reason his clients print shop and home were 
searched friday lawyer john knowles said the searches were 
probably related to flemings indictment on charges of conspiring 
to export weapons reportedly to northern ireland 
there have been no arrests in the investigation of december mail 
bombings that killed 11th us circuit court of appeals judge 
robert vance and savannah ga lawyer robert robinson 
two other bombs were intercepted at the jacksonville fla 
naacp office and the 11th circuit courthouse at atlanta the threat 
to the national association for the advancement of colored people 
aroused fears that all the bombings were racially motivated that 
concern was heightened by a letter from an obscure group claiming 
responsibility for them 
fleming who has come under the scrutiny of fbi agents probing 
the mail bombs has pleaded innocent to an unrelated federal 
conspiracy charge and remains free on 50000 bond 
knowles said sunday he didnt know of flemings naacp connection 
and refused to allow his client to be interviewed 
in enterprise zi fleming sr president of the coffee county 
naacp said the print shop owner paid the 10 annual dues and 
joined the local chapter in 1987 
i know him pretty well he appeared to me to be interested in 
our goals said fleming who is black 
bf garth another naacp member said he saw the print shop 
owner during meetings and doubted that fleming was trying to 
infiltrate the chapter 
he participated in discussions and acted like an ordinary 
member to me garth said 
on friday fleming and his wife georgia were fingerprinted 
during separate trips to the police station while the searches were 
under way 
the attention focused on fleming who has not been charged in 
the mail bomb case drew the spotlight away from robert wayne 
oferrell the salvage store operator whose 11th circuit appeal in 
an employment compensation case attracted the fbis attention

east germanys communist party on sunday 
changed its name and promised to hand over 600 million in assets 
to the government in an apparent attempt to improve its image ahead 
of coming elections 
also sunday west germanys foreign minister promised to seek 
immediate financial aid to stabilize east germanys economy while 
it adopts democratic reforms that could lead to reunification 
hansdietrich genscher who was born near halle in what is now 
east germany also told a political rally in east berlin that 
european neighbors have nothing to fear from a united germany 
in pursuit of unification bonn appears willing to swear off 
future claims to ethnic german regions that are now part of poland 
czechoslovakia and the soviet union 
leaders of east germanys disgraced communist party met and 
formally changed its name to the party of democratic socialism it 
previously had been known as the socialist unity party of germany 
the party also said it will hand over 600 million from its 
private reserves to government coffers because the countrys 
economic situation requires such support the government news 
agency adn reported 
adn said the money came from party dues and partyowned 
businesses such as printing operations it did not say what the 
partys total reserves are 
the moves were the latest attempt by the communists to shore up 
their image ahead of the march 18 elections the first free 
balloting in the nations 40year history was made possible by a 
prodemocracy revolution last year that ousted hardline communist 
party chief erich honecker on oct 18 
the communists who dominate the current interim government 
headed by premier hans modrow are widely blamed for the nations 
economic problems 
genscher noting the dire state of the east german economy said 
bonn will have to help its struggling neighbor provide health care 
and basic goods and services for its increasingly restive citizens 
german unity will not come for free genscher told a 
founding congress of the opposition east german free democratic 
party 
west germany also is considering other measures to help east 
germany 
west german finance minister theo waigel proposed last week that 
the west german mark be introduced as the recognized currency in 
east germany to give its 16 million citizens confidence that 
reforms are imminent 
a prominent east german politician dresden mayor wolfgang 
berghofer also appealed for immediate currency reform during a 
weekend international economics conference in the swiss resort of 
davos 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany and modrow met at davos 
to discuss ways that bonn can aid east germany until a new 
government can be seated and a plan for reunification drafted 
modrow said sunday that his own proposals for german unification 
are not dead despite bonns rejection of his position that a united 
germany should be neutral he said his neutrality proposal was only 
part of an effort to open a dialogue on germanys future 
in munich west germany nato general secretary manfred woerner 
said the western alliance supports german unity but not at the cost 
of the alliance 
those who call for dissolving the western alliance risk the 
security and unity of germany and europe woerner a west 
german told an annual conference of lawmakers security experts 
and government officials from the nato countries 
since east germany ousted honecker opened the berlin wall and 
lifted travel restrictions thousands of people have fled to the 
west each day as their nation becomes increasingly unstable 
the departures averaging 2000 a day in january are reducing 
the nations productivity and causing food shortages and reductions 
in other services 
genscher and the leader of his free democratic party otto graf 
lambsdorff flew to berlin to attend the inaugural meeting of the 
opposition east german free democratic party and to offer political 
support 
west german politicians also plan to meet next week with other 
reformist political parties in east germany lambsdorff urged them 
to band together to improve their chances of winning parliamentary 
seats in the march 18 voting

moslem separatists on sunday blew up a 
bus and hurled bombs at an indian paramilitary patrol a government 
building and the home of a state lawmaker in a new series of 
attacks in kashmirs largest city 
no one was killed in the attacks the latest violence since 
india launched a crackdown jan 20 on the groups that want the 
northern region bordering moslem pakistan to secede from 
predominantly hindu india at least 76 people have died since then 
also sunday police said suspected sikh militants killed nine 
people over the weekend in attacks on two buses in the northern 
state of punjab sikh extremists are fighting to make an 
independent nation out of the rich farming state which borders 
pakistan farther south 
political leaders in pakistan demanded that india end the 
crackdown in kashmir and declared monday a national holiday to show 
support for the moslem militants 
the attacks in srinagar came sunday morning after authorities 
lifted a curfew for 12 hours 
one woman was injured when a bomb exploded on an empty bus as 
passengers were gathering to board witnesses and a police said 
the bomb destroyed the vehicle and damaged three nearby shops 
members of the jammukashmir liberation front also speaking on 
condition of anonymity said their group was responsible for the 
attacks which included bombs thrown at a paramiliary patrol at a 
government office the home of a state legislator and a school 
there were no further reports of injuries 
shops on sunday stayed shut respecting a strike call by the 
islamic militant 
srinagar a city of 1 million is the summer capital of 
jammukashmir state which has been claimed by both india and 
moslem pakistan since the two nations were partitioned along 
religious lines upon attaining independence from britain in 1947 
the two traditionally hostile neighbors went to war in 1948 and 
1965 over the territory 
india has repeatedly charged pakistan with fomenting the trouble 
on its side of the ceasefire line a charge routinely dismissed by 
pakistan 
in the pakistani capital of islamabad the demand for an end to 
the indian crackdown came in a rare agreement between governing and 
opposition parties 
pakistans combined opposition of rightwing centrist and 
religious parties called for a nationwide strike on monday in 
support of the separatists 
prime minister benazir bhuttos government replied by declaring 
monday a holiday in a show of solidarity with them 
jammukashmir is the only indian state with a moslem majority 
it is composed of the predominantly hindu southern jammu region and 
the mostly moslem northern kashmir sector 
a western section of kashmir is controlled by pakistan along a 
ceasefire line where indian and pakistani troops face each other 
sometimes at distances of only a few hundred yards 
nationally hindus comprise 82 percent of indias 880 million 
people but they make up only 32 percent of jammukashmirs 5 
million people

israeli officials said sunday the attack on a 
bus carrying israeli tourists in the egyptian desert was a 
carefully planned operation carried out at a sensitive moment in 
the middle east peace process 
in the assault at least eight people were killed and 17 were 
injured when masked men fired machine guns and hurled hand grenades 
at the bus on a desert road about 40 miles north of cairo an 
egyptian government statement said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir speaking in an interview with 
israel television said 
this murderous attack on israeli tourists in the center of 
egypt is a most serious shocking event this attack proves 
that hostility towards israel still exists and runs amok in the 
region 
we hope the egyptian authorities will do everything possible 
to find the killers punish them and prevent further events of this 
sort shamir said 
the attack came two days before a crucial meeting of shamirs 
hardline likud bloc at which shamir is to defend his middle east 
peace plan against assaults by a group of influential party hawks 
shamirs plan calls for palestinian elections in the occupied 
territories as a first step toward peace the hawks say the plan 
approved by israels coalition government is too dangerous for the 
country 
if shamir is successful a meeting of foreign ministers of the 
united states israel and egypt is likely to take place later this 
month to prepare for a round of israelipalestinian talks in cairo 
however the attack could strengthen the positions of 
hardliners who want to block shamirs peace plan and say egypt 
cannot be a fair mediator because of its close links with the plo 
although israel officially considers the plo to be a terrorist 
group likud hardliners fear shamirs plan would give it a role in 
peace negotiations 
we should not accept any expressions of sorrow anymore the 
egyptians have to prove they are disassociated only by one way a 
total rejection of the plo of plo institutions of their meetings 
with plo leader yasser arafat and terrorists in egypt likud 
lawmaker yehoshua matza said on israel army radio 
they have lately allowed these groups to operate freely in 
egypt and when there is a free hand and egyptian instigation every 
day we witness such terrible killings he said 
other likud officials including some of shamirs supporters 
were more cautious about blaming egypt the only arab country with 
which israel has peace 
we can say with certainty that these criminals wanted to kill 
israelis to kill the very idea of coexistence between israelis and 
arabs said deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu 
this is not a spontaneous action but a planned one apparently 
it was necessary to gather intelligence and plan it he said 
ehud olmert likuds cabinet minister in charge of arab affairs 
said diplomatic links with egypt are important but suggested 
israelis should stop visiting egypt 
olmerts suggestion was supported by several rightwing parties 
such as moledet and tzomet in 19851986 israeli tourism to egypt 
came to a virtual halt for a year following the oct 6 1985 
attack in which an egyptian policeman shot dead seven israeli 
tourists in the sinai peninsula 
finance minister shimon peres of the leftleaning labor party 
shamirs rival and coalition partner said israel should pursue its 
peace plan despite the attack the party has warned it would leave 
the government if likuds hawks block peace efforts 
it is clear that we have to prevail over the murderers and not 
leave the fate of peace at the hands of terrorists and madmen he 
said on army radio 
education minister yitzhak navon an influential labor leader 
said the attack was an attempt by a radical arab group to 
disrupt our relations with egypt to disrupt this peace 
the leftist peace now group issued a statement calling on jews 
and arabs to act together to stop a crazy minority ready to spill 
blood in order to stop the peace process 
leftwing israelis planned to organize a mass pilgrimage to 
cairo for a meeting with plo members there the action is designed 
to challenge an israeli law banning unauthorized contacts with the 
plo

about 260 people from around georgia will trade 
places with an equal number of soviet georgians this april in a 
program planned by a group that promotes international exchanges 
the georgia to georgia friendship exchange sponsored by 
friendship force will be the first time residents from around the 
state will take part in such a program and is a test of the 
feasibility of large exchanges said atlantatbilsi sister city 
committee chairman george brown 
past exchanges have involved only about 25 people brown said 
friendship force founder wayne smith has dreamed of doing this 
by the thousands he said 
exchanges between the two georgias began in 1985 when 11 tbilisi 
residents visited atlanta the two georgia capitals atlanta and 
tbilisi later formed a sister city relationship and since then 
small delegations of residents and city leaders have visited each 
other 
friendship force plans to take applications and interview 
prospective travelers around georgia next weekend 
the 260 americans who make the grade are to fly to tbilisi on 
april 17 for a 12day stay an equal number of soviet georgians are 
to arrive in atlanta on april 18 for a week in atlanta and another 
week in other sections of the state 
the cost for americans is 1295 although financial aid will be 
available 
he said friendship force workers would try to match hosts and 
guests with similar occupations and interests so they could see how 
their jobs were performed in the other country 
we hope an elementary school teacher for example would be 
placed with someone involved with elementary schools so they could 
attend class and observe brown said 
brown said that if the exchange goes well atlantabased 
friendship force hopes to expand the program to other states with 
sister cities in the soviet union

the hit movie coming to america has made 
no profit despite 350 million in worldwide ticket sales according 
to financial documents released by paramount pictures 
the documents released to the los angeles times by court order 
saturday also show that the movies star eddie murphy and his 
assistants ran up 5 million in bills for food travel lodging and 
other expenses during the making of the movie 
pulitzer prizewinning columnist art buchwald and producer alain 
bernheim won a lawsuit against paramount two months ago that 
claimed the studio took the idea for the 1988 movie from a screen 
treatment by buchwald paramount was ordered to pay buchwald and 
bernheim 19 percent of the movies net profits 
a financial audit is scheduled during a forthcoming phase of the 
trial to determine how much money buchwald and bernheim should 
receive 
the records were sealed during the trial at paramounts request 
but studio officials had testified that the movie was still in the 
red 
part of the reason according to the documents is the priority 
system for profit sharing set out in the contracts the studio 
negotiates 
in the case of coming to america the court papers show that 
the cost of the films production marketing and distribution all 
come out of the gross receipts along with more than 13 million 
paid to eddie murphy productions and the 35 percent distribution 
fee charged by the studio 
charges that paramount absorbed during the making of coming to 
america could become an issue in the accounting phase of the suit 
charges to production made on murphys behalf included 4920 a 
week for a limousine and driver kept on call around the clock 
2200 per week paid for a special motor home for murphy 1592 
per week paid to the motor homes driver 1500 a week for a 
personal trainer and 650 a week for a valet 
none of those expenses came out of murphys 8 million salary 
his 15 percent share of the films gross receipts his own travel 
and hotel expenses or his 5000aweek living allowance

nicaraguan businessmen are rooting for 
an opposition victory in elections feb 25 but theyre also 
bracing for six more years under the leftist sandinistas 
foreign observers say the vote could go either way but some 
also say that even if the sandinistas triumph they will have to 
make changes especially in their economic policies 
if they win the force of facts will compel the sandinistas 
to reverse their policies of central economic control and state 
ownership of major enterprises one western european diplomat 
observed 
i see in some sandinista commanders a very strong 
realization that the private sector has to be strengthened and 
that the relaunching of the economy here is impossible without its 
natural market which is the united states said the diplomat 
who like others insisted on anonymity 
virtually all businessmen are pulling for the usbacked 
coalition of 14 parties the national opposition union the 
coalition advocates free enterprise and a market economy but is 
also promising social service improvements to woo the left 
the coalition is dominated by big business but includes a wide 
range of ideologies from conservatives to communists 
it has promised closer relations with the united states which 
imposed economic sanctions on nicaragua shortly after the 
sandinistas with close military ties to the cubans and soviets 
seized power in 1979 the united states also backs the contra 
rebels 
if the opposition wins it says prospects are good for 
attracting 400 million in immediate us investment to help the 
warbattered economy they say most of the money would be spent in 
farming and related industries 
business leaders say things have to change even if the 
sandinistas win they say the sandinistas will have to delete 
provisions from the constitution like the one that says the state 
is in charge of directing and planning the national economy 
its a matter of the sandinista front projecting to the world 
that it has changed its ideology said ramiro gurdian who is 
president of the agricultural producers union 
in recent years as the nation plunged deeper into crisis the 
sandinistas loosened their grip over the economy 
gone are gasoline coupons and ration cards gone are government 
inspectors who boarded buses to confiscate staples from peasants 
reluctant to sell produce to the state 
critics say this is still not enough farmers must still sell at 
least part of their crops to the government at a set price and 
purchase such things as fertilizer from the state 
they cant keep on like that they just cant said gurdian 
communism is finished everywhere in the world people are 
turning to the free market system its only these gentlemen who 
insist on continuing to control everything 
the sandinistas imposed an an austerity program to reduce 
inflation of 33600 percent in 1988 but inflation was 1689 
percent last year 
president daniel ortega who is seeking reelection said last 
week that exports rose from 230 million in 1988 to 298 million 
last year and imports dropped from 807 million to 711 million 
but nicaraguas currency the cordoba had to be devalued 36 
times in 1989 
this economy is like a very sick patient a vegetable thats 
kept alive purely through tubes said gilberto cuadra president 
of the superior council of private enterprise nicaraguas leading 
business group 
unlike gurdian cuadra doesnt think he could deal with the 
sandinistas in power until 1996 comparing it to a marriage 
between a dead person and a live one 
it just doesnt work he added saying the sandinistas have 
lost their confidence we have nothing more to do if things 
dont change its not worthwhile to keep producing 
business leaders still remember the many coffee farms the 
sandinistas confiscated some as recently as last year many 
businessmen say the seizures were acts of vengeance against 
sandinista opponents 
more recently the president in a speech at a political rally 
threatened to confiscate a cooking oil factory managed by the 
soninlaw of opposition presidential candidate violeta barrios de 
chamorro 
even if the sandinista front wins crystalclear elections 
it still wont attract the trust of foreign investors one latin 
american diplomat said

archbishop desmond tutu urged fellow 
members of a harvard university governing board sunday to back 
divestment in south africa until changes promised by that countrys 
president become reality 
in a news conference following a closeddoor meeting of the 
board of overseers tutu said that much of what south african 
president fw de klerk said last week was a declaration of purpose 
sanctions should remain in place until certain conditions are 
met tutu said 
in last weeks speech de klerk promised to free jailed african 
national congress leader nelson mandela and lift government bans on 
30 outlawed opposition groups 
tutu who won the 1984 nobel peace prize for his antiapartheid 
efforts welcomed the announcement but tempered his response with 
pragmatism 
wed like to see these things immediately but lets be 
realistic the parliamentary session has just begun the anglican 
archbishop said 
tutu said he had asked colleagues on the 30member board of 
overseers to press harvard to withdraw 139 million in investments 
in south african companies until mandela is freed all exiled 
political activists are granted amnesty and the governments policy 
of segregation is dismantled 
the board planned to further consider the divestment issue at a 
future meeting 
the board is less powerful than the universitys main governing 
body the harvard corp but is the only alumnielected panel with 
an influence on school policy the board plays no role in 
daytoday business but must give formal consent to major 
initiaitves and appointments 
tutu who ran for the board on an antiapartheid slate was 
elected last june along with us labor secretary elizabeth dole 
and actor john lithgow 
the archbishop said de klerks action last week was sparked by 
the growing number of countries that had placed sanctions on south 
africa a position tutu said seemed to be catching on among fellow 
board members 
he said he was encouraged by the attention south africa had 
received in the united states amid the historic changes in the 
soviet bloc 
the kind of coverage and response is indicative that in spite 
of what has happened in eastern europe which pushed our case to 
the back burner people here do want to see our situation 
resolved he said 
asked why he was in massachusetts rather than south africa at 
such a critical time tutu replied harvard is harvard the 
things that harvard does and does not do have an impact far beyond 
what you would expect from an educational institution

popularized transcendental meditation in the 1960s 
construction of the first of 100 homes in the city of immortals 
could begin as early as spring said walter reifslager of charter 
development group 
the homes will be built with essentially toxicfree materials 
and gasolinepowered cars will have to be parked on the outskirts 
of the community the austin man said there is talk of a 
maharishistyle theme park 
homes would cost between 200000 and the sevenfigure 
range reifslager said 
we had a concept and then we heard about the maharishis 
heaven on earth approach reifslager said in a recent interview 
it so epitomized what we had been thinking about doing thats 
when we decided to pursue building a heaven on earth project 
the proposed development between driftwood and oak hill about 30 
miles southwest of downtown austin has raised concerns in this 
quiet region 
i can tell you frankly that there are people in this 
community who are adamant in opposition to these people said 
rev joel c thielepape pastor of the nearby friendship baptist 
church they feel there is something to be feared by this 
development 
thielepape said he has no major problems with the development 
partly because the rural county has been exposed already to 
disciples of transcendental meditation a nearby subdivision known 
as radiance was developed several years ago by transcendental 
meditation practitioners 
last december a plan to create a city of immortals west of 
tulsa okla drew the attention of such groups as the oklahoma 
cult awareness network 
an unidentified network spokesman told the dallas morning news 
he was worried that the maharishis group is organized along the 
same lines as many destructive cults a claim hotly denied by 
transcendental meditation backers 
reifslager said he and his associates have already interviewed 
potential home buyers and that one home has already been designed 
he said the project is not being marketed strictly to those who 
practice transcendental meditation and that no one in the 
community will be compelled to practice it 
the hill country is not the only proposed site for 
maharishistyle communities 
curtis mcdonald vice president of heaven on earth development 
corp based in malibu calif said his company has been working to 
locate communities near houston denver san francisco los 
angeles san diego washington dc toronto and in southeastern 
iowa

my campaign folk get upset when i say this but i dont want a 
runoff young told a meeting of the southside public officials 
last week when he revealed his plans to make a formal announcement

democratic polls the race also includes state sen roy e barnes 
and state rep lauren w mcdonald jr who is backed by powerful 
house speaker tom murphy and former gov lester maddox 
the number of hopefuls in the field likely will make it very 
difficult for any candidate to get the 50 percent plus one vote 
needed to win the primary outright said robert s kahn barnes 
campaign manager 
the primary is set for july 17 and a runoff would be held aug 
7

i have been driven to serve because thats what makes life 
worthwhile

the internal revenue service is taking 
on the church of scientology in federal court contending that its 
worldwide spiritual headquarters in clearwater is a business and 
should be paying taxes 
scientologists vehemently disagree calling the irs corrupt and 
accusing it of pursuing a vendetta against scientology 
we feel the federal government should investigate illegal drug 
running in florida and should investigate money laundering in 
florida banks spokesman humberto fontana told the st petersburg 
times in a story published sunday 
the clearwater group pays no pinellas county property taxes on 
its church buildings and has paid income taxes only once 
scientologists also are in court with pinellas county over the 
organizations taxexempt status 
the federal government has asked for 47 categories of documents 
for 1985 1986 and 1987 that the scientologists say would number 
more than 50000 pages 
the scientologists refused but did agree to explain some 
aspects of their financing in response to specific questions from 
the irs that material has entered the public file in us district 
court in tampa 
a similar case involving the church of scientology of california 
took 18 years to resolve after the us supreme court refused to 
hear a scientology appeal 
the clearwater scientology branch has been secretive about its 
finances but the case has prompted it to disclose for the first 
time that their organization pays annual operating expenses of 26 
million 
it said it sends millions of dollars each year to scientology 
organizations elsewhere including 145 million for literature and 
supplies 45 million for dissemination and expansion 24 
million for advanced technology and 13 million for films 
all in 1987 the last year for which the scientologists provided 
figures 
the clearwater branch said it pools reserve accounts with more 
than 100 other scientology organizations the pool in 1987 had 
assets of 206 million liabilities of 1656 million and a net 
worth of 404 million 
according to the new court documents the clearwater base has a 
staff of 700 to 1100 
scientology began with l ron hubbard an energetic writer with 
flaming red hair who was known for his rollicking western tales and 
fanciful sciencefiction stories in the early 1950s hubbard began 
writing about a religion that he named scientology 
he spread the word about the benefits of auditing a sort of 
counseling process that involves a device called an emeter and 
thousands of dollars in auditing fees 
court records reveal that nonstaff scientologists who persuade 
someone to undergo auditing can receive 10 percent of the auditing 
fee those who persuade someone to take religious training can 
receive 15 percent of the course fee 
in 1987 the clearwater organization paid commissions of 146 
million

a california assemblyman who called a 
group of homosexual protesters faggots said he was unaware that 
the term was offensive but still refuses to apologize 
i didnt even know that faggot was a derogatory term 
thats what ive always heard them called i know that people dont 
call them queers any more assemblyman gil ferguson said saturday 
i wont call them gay though ferguson said i dont 
think theres anything gay about it its depressing 
ferguson a republican running for the state senate was 
picketed by a homosexual rights group earlier in the day during a 
campaign appearance in this orange county community 
i dont care about them ferguson told reporters im a 
retired marine a couple of faggots out there arent going to scare 
me 
ferguson is running in a special election tuesday in a heavily 
republican state senate district which is split between los 
angeles and orange counties 
he was picketed during an appearance at the power community 
church with the rev louis b sheldon who strongly backed 
antihomosexual measures on several city ballots last november 
ferguson later said he meant no harm but would not back down 
from the comment 
i have learned since this morning that they have style manuals 
about etiquette and what youre supposed to call people ferguson 
said i could have called them sodomites 
some of fergusons seven opponents attacked his remarks 
thats awful democrat janice graham said 
i might think gays are wrong but to try to publicly demean 
them by using words like faggots or queers i think mr 
ferguson should have stopped and thought about that said diamond 
bar city councilman gary miller a republican 
during last years republican state convention ferguson wrote a 
resolution calling on the party to ban clubs based on sexual 
orientation it was rejected by state republican leaders including 
us sen pete wilson and gov george deukmejian

of directors had a regularly scheduled meeting on tuesday but he 
said the company did not comment on topics before the board
