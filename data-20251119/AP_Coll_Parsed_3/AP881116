the us trade deficit narrowed by almost 15 
percent to 105 billion in september the government said 
wednesday but not enough to prevent a new assault on the dollar 
over worries about what the head of the federal reserve called a 
dangerous corrosion of the american economy 
exports rose by 700 million to a record high 282 billion the 
commerce department said imports declined by 25 percent or 11 
billion to 387 billion from a record high in august the 105 
billion trade gap for september was down by 18 billion from the 
revised august trade deficit figure of 123 billion a drop of 
about 146 percent 
but neither change was big enough to stem a new selling wave of 
dollars by traders worried about inflation from an overheating 
economy and skeptical of presidentelect george bushs promise to 
reduce the federal budget deficit through a flexible freeze 
without any tax increases 
the dollar resuming its downward path of last week fell nearly 
1 percent against the japanese yen to 12224 yen in new york trading 
despite what currency traders said was intervention by the fed to 
prop it up through massive purchases of dollars using yen the 
figure was the lowest close against the yen in new york trading 
since modern exchange rates were established in the late 1940s 
in the tokyo market thursday morning the dollar also fared 
badly even though one dealer said the bank of japan intervened to 
prevent the dollars further decline the dollar there opened at 
12240 yen down from wednesdays close of 12354 yen and by 
midmorning was trading at 12195 yen 
the dollar also fell 15 percent against the west german mark in 
new york trading 
in the past month the dollar has fallen nearly 9 percent in 
value against the yen and about 7 percent against the mark halted 
only by a brief respite monday when bush and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady promised that the new administration would not scrap 
a twoyear effort to maintain its stability 
stock prices in turn resumed their downward turn with the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks falling 3859 points 
many analysts had expected the trade deficit to drop into 
single digits or below 10 billion in september like it did in 
may and july 
when it didnt more general concerns over the federal budget 
deficit and the willingness of foreigners to keep financing us 
consumer habits triggered the wednesday selling spree on financial 
markets said david wyss chief financial economist for data 
resources inc of lexington mass 
exports were up imports were down the reaction should have 
been positive wyss said although the trade deficit has 
improved the improvement seems to have stalled out at about 11 
billion deficit a month add to that figures on growth that weve 
seen in the past couple of weeks and the market has good reason to 
be pessimistic 
including the september figures the trade deficit the first nine 
months of this year is running at an annual rate of 1372 billion 
compared with a record 1703 billion last year and 1551 billion 
in 1986 
the government reported earlier that the unemployment rate in 
october had fallen back to 53 percent matching a 14year low and 
that retail sales in the month had shown their biggest increase in 
seven months 
the commerce department also reported wednesday that plants were 
running at 84 percent of their capacity the highest rate of the 
sixyear economic expansion all of those figures are viewed as 
bellwethers of higher inflation 
the improvement in the trade deficit was welcome but it simply 
wasnt good enough said allen sinai chief economist for the 
boston co a financial consulting firm 
the decline in imports was only onefourth as big as last 
months increase sinai said and while exports continue at a 
blistering pace that also suggests more inflationary pressure 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told the national 
economic commission on wednesday that the budget deficit that was 
largely ignored in the presidential debates courts a dangerous 
corrosion of our economy 
in addition to the trade numbers analysts said the downturn in 
stock prices wednesday can be attributed at least partially to 
greenspans vow to tighten the money supply unless the budget 
deficit is addressed promptly 
more than onethird of the september decrease in imports was 
represented by smaller purchases of foreign oil and at lower prices 
than in august imports fell 400000 barrels a day and the average 
price dropped 45 cents a barrel to 1460 the lowest it has been in 
two years 
while there also were anticipated declines in textile shoe 
steel and chemical imports they were not as big as some analysts 
had anticipated and new cars coming into the american market from 
abroad climbed by 8 percent to an 8 billion monthly high for the 
year when they had been expected to decline 
thats one of the things that worried the markets wyss said 
it suggests were us auto producers are still having trouble 
holding on to market share 
as usual the united states suffered its biggest deficit with 
japan at 41 billion however the gap was 700 million less than 
it had been in august and was at its lowest since january the trade 
gap with western european countries also fell by more than 500 
million to 880 million in september 
with the newly industrialized asian countries singapore hong 
kong taiwan and south korea the trade gap narrowed by nearly 250 
million to slightly less than 31 billion but the us deficit 
position with canada nearly tripled to 11 billion

cia director william h webster said 
wednesday night that mikhail gorbachevs policy of glasnost has not 
reduced the soviet threat to the united states and may even increase 
it 
the soviet unions military capability its efforts to increase 
global influence and its aggressive intelligence activities are 
still serious threats to united states interests he said in a 
speech to the yale political union 
gorbachevs efforts to reform his country have not 
fundamentally altered these truths he said adding they arguably 
make the soviets even a greater threat 
the soviet union is and will continue to be the primary focus 
of our intelligence collection and analysis webster said 
after his appearance before students webster held a brief news 
conference which is rare for a director of central intelligence 
asked if soviet spying had decreased as a result of gorbachevs 
policy of openness webster answered no when asked if soviet 
spying had increased he responded possibly adding there is 
very intensive intelligence work he did not elaborate 
whatever arms control agreements the united states makes with the 
soviet union he said i believe that our relationship is likely 
to remain essentially adversarial 
on the matter of his own future as cia chief under the bush 
administration webster said he had not yet been contacted by the 
presidentelects transition team 
he said he did not want to speculate on whether bush would 
reappoint him or choose someone else but he denied he had done any 
lobbying for the job saying i have asked no one to advance my 
interest 
asked how he thought the cia would be affected by having a 
president who was a former chief of the agency webster said he does 
not expect any significant changes although he believes bush will 
support the work of intelligence because he understands it 
webster said the presidentelect had asked that he receive daily 
briefings from the cia 
in discussing gorbachev webster said he is an impressive leader 
and skillful politican whose ability to get things done in spite of 
powerful opposition should not be underestimated 
but he said when we watch the leadership we also have to see 
what actual reforms are being made in terms of military activity 
aggressive intelligence against the united states improvements in 
civil rights and all the things that are important to us 
here we are still waiting for progress the cia chief said 
the forces of democracy are making some political and economic 
inroads although the ussr is not yet headed to democracy as we 
know it he said 
webster said the soviet reform effort presents the intelligence 
community with some very formidable challenges 
we must manage the information explosion that glasnost has 
produced which though very welcome and very healthy in any respect 
you look at challenges us in intelligence to sort out what is 
important and what is not from a large volume of information that 
was not previously available and what is real versus what moscow 
wants us to hear

the disappearance of four young people 
over the weekend still had police baffled four days later and the 
youths parents offered a 20000 reward wednesday for information 
in the case 
we dont have indication of foul play but the longer time goes 
on the more unusual the situation and the less likely it is the 
kids are out on a lark said state police spokeswoman marcy stamm 
youd think one of the kids would have called by now 
state police have issued a nationwide alert for the car the four 
were last seen in and distributed a missing persons flier 
nationally 
the missing friends three 19yearold women and a 20yearold 
man were last seen saturday night at an apartment near southern 
connecticut state university in new haven 
the missing teenagers are jill sawyer a student at the 
university of rhode island christy stevens a student at mohegan 
community college in norwich michael gallo a student at southern 
connecticut and laura lagrotteria who works at the crystal mall in 
waterford 
stamm said the four had about 50 among them and no change of 
clothes she said extensive interviews with friends and family gave 
no indication the group had planned to run away 
their parents who reported them missing sunday night announced 
through state police a 10000 reward and doubled it later wednesday 
family and friends described the four 1987 graduates of east lyme 
high school as responsible adults not likely to take off without 
telling anyone 
stevens father james o stevens said the three women had been 
close friends since grade school he said although they knew gallo 
they had not seen him much until recently 
if christy was going to come in later than 2 am we would 
always get a call telling us she would be late stevens said 
a state police airplane traced all possible routes the four could 
have taken from east lyme to new haven but turned up no sign of 
stevens car

the mayor was acquitted tuesday of charges 
he misused city money and swindled three businessmen 
a st louis county district court jury reached the verdict after 
more than six hours of deliberations following two weeks of 
testimony 
mayor john fedo sat motionless while the verdicts were read then 
embraced his attorney douglas sauter who was crying 
i dont think anyone could really describe the experience so 
im not going to try fedo said after leaving the courtroom 
everything that needed to be said was said in the courtoom 
the mayor said adding that hed like to thank the people of duluth 
and tell them hed now be back to work 
we have finally finished the election of 1987 fedo said 
referring to his contention that the charges against him were 
politically motivated by multimillionaire jeno paulucci and fedos 
other political adversaries 
prosecutor vernon swanum would not comment nor would jurors 
fedo faced eight felony charges and one gross misdemeanor count 
charging him with falsifying travel expenses in 1985 and with 
pocketing 13500 he solicited from three duluth businessmen 
the travelrecord charges stemmed from 1985 when prosecutors 
contended fedo made up names of guests when he actually dined at 
city expense with lory cossi who is now his wife fedo admitted 
inaccuracies but said they resulted from failing to remember who was 
there when asked by auditors months after the meals 
no witnesses testified they saw fedo spending the 13500 from 
the three businessmen on himself

the dalai lama spiritual and temporal 
leader of tibetans says time is running out for preserving his 
peoples culture and the only way to save it may be a compromise 
with china over independence 
the man revered as a godking by his people said in an interview 
with the associated press that i am not insisting we should be an 
independent country 
instead he said he was seeking a middle way that would 
preserve the culture he fears will vanish if china continues to rule 
tibet for another 10 or 15 years 
the remarks sounded conciliatory but the dalai lama insisted in 
the interview tuesday they were not a modification of a proposal he 
made five months ago in which china would keep troops on tibetan 
soil and handle tibets foreign policy 
sitting in a suite at new delhis luxury ashoka hotel during a 
trip to visit tibetan refugees the dalai lama repeatedly expressed 
worries that time was running out to save his homeland 
it was these concerns that prompted his june 15 proposal in 
strasbourg france where the european parliament was meeting in 
that proposal his biggest concession since china invaded tibet in 
1949 and annexed it a year later he suggested tibet become a 
selfgoverning democratic political entity in association with 
china 
the proposal drew criticism from tibetan exiles around the world 
and prompted a spate of protest letters to the dalai lamas own 
exile headquarters in dharmsala a himalayan foothills town 300 
miles north of new delhi 
china rejected the proposal saying it failed to relinquish the 
concept of tibetan independence but said it is willing to talk to 
the dalai lama 
in a way sad but realistically in order to save tibetan 
culture tibetan people and find some kind of satisfaction for 
them as a free spokesman for tibetan people i make a suggestion or 
proposal on a middle way the dalai lama said in the interview 
in the northeast part of tibet my birthplace area already in 
that part of tibet tibetans are becoming insignificant a small 
minority said the bespectacled buddhist holy man 
he said that according to chinese statistics the tibetan 
population in the area where he was born is 800000 and the chinese 
population about 3 million 
the dalai lama whose name means ocean of wisdom was born 53 
years ago and named tenzin gyatso one of seven children of a farmer 
in the poor village of tagtser tagtser now lies in china outside 
what beijing has designated the tibetan autonomous region 
the creation of the region shrinking the area tibetans consider 
tibet is the main reason why the dalai lama says there are 6 
million tibetans and china says there are 2 million an influx of 
chinese settlers into the area including the tibetan capital of 
lhasa has further diluted the oncehomogenous tibetan population 
it also has spawned riots such as the ones in lhasa in october 
1987 and again in march when cars were set afire a police station 
burned and at least 35 tibetans and three chinese policemen killed 
the dalai lama who fled to india in 1959 after an unsuccessful 
uprising said he thought nonviolent tactics would be more 
successful in attaining tibetan control over internal tibetan 
affairs such as education health services industry mining and 
construction of houses 
at last he said the chinese are finally recognizing tibet as a 
place with a cultural identity of its own 
as evidence he cited what he said was the establishment of a 
center for tibetan studies in beijing and the willingness of chinese 
officials to meet a tibetan delegation in geneva in january the 
dalai lama said he did not plan to take part in any geneva talks at 
least at the initial stage 
asked whether his proposals for tibet could be construed as 
autonomy within the chinese nation the maroonandgold robed dalai 
lama said pensively autonomy thats a nice word 
but his secretary for the past 15 years tenzin geyche tethong 
who holds cabinet rank in the tibetan governmentinexile 
interjected we dont use the word autonomy 
after the interview tethong said its something that at this 
point his holiness does not want to be very specific about 
the dalai lama whose status as godking of the tibetans began in 
1940 when he was a 4yearold child travels with a retinue of 
advisers aides and bodyguards 
his holy status was conferred when buddhist monks decided he was 
the 14th incarnation of the physical manifestation of the buddhist 
lord of compassion avalokitesvara this decision was made when the 
small boy was silently presented with a host of articles ignored 
most of them but picked out the only three that had belonged to the 
13th dalai lama who died in 1933

a jewish leader who defended last 
weeks controversial kristallnacht speech by the president of 
parliament quit today after being strongly criticized by other jews 
officials said 
michael fuerst deputy chairman of the national jewish council 
had been harshly criticized for comments he made following 
thursdays speech of thenparliament president philipp jenninger 
jenninger reminded his audience that many germans initially 
welcomed nazi dictator adolf hitler and recalled that many people 
thought the jews deserved being put back in their place 
jenninger also called the early nazi years a triumphal 
procession 
hours later fuerst told a nationally televised panel discussion 
i welcome the fact that the parliament president described in full 
clarity what was happening in germany between 1933 and 1938 
especially the fact that everything hitler did was strongly 
supported by the masses of all germans 
anger over the speech mounted at home and abroad and jenninger 
quit the next day he said he had been misunderstood but also told 
nationwide television you cant call everything by its name in 
germany 
jenninger 56 gave the speech on the 50th anniversary of 
kristallnacht the night of terror against the jews that signaled 
the coming holocaust 
fuerst 41 told the associated press on monday he fully 
supported what he said last week he said he had received numerous 
telephone calls of approval 
ive been confirmed in that opinion by the many people who have 
called me since then he told the ap he acknowledged however 
that a majority of west germanys jewish community felt 
differently 
council chairman heinz galinski who had led the criticism 
against his own deputy today made the announcement of fuersts 
resignation 
he gave as a reason the longstanding lack of agreement between 
me and himself galinski a 75yearold auschwitz survivor told 
the ap at a council meeting in frankfurt 
galinski said the rest of the national council leadership stood 
behind him 100 percent he has been at the forefront of 
condemning jenningers speech 
fuerst was at the meeting but not immediately available for 
comment 
the jenninger dispute has intensified west germanys debate over 
the haunting legacy of the third reich 
many people like fuerst have cautiously approved of the 
christian democratic politicians reminders of how the germans 
initially greeted hitler 
the part about the people staying silent giving approval and 
that it could happen among a majority of the germans people say 
that very seldom said parliament member hildegard hammbruecher 
galinski said that if fuerst had not resigned the council would 
have taken a vote of no confidence against him there are 18 council 
members and 16 were at todays meeting 
council member nathan kalmanowicz from munich said all but one 
or two of the council members made clear they wanted fuerst to step 
down 
he had no chance the overwhelming majority was against him it 
was not just us but the whole jewish community he said 
a successor for fuerst will be chosen when elections for all 18 
council members are held in january or february

the fbi and us attorneys office have 
joined the investigation into an attack by suspected 
whitesupremacist skinheads that left a black man dead and two 
others injured a federal prosecutor says 
mulugeta seraw a 27yearold ethiopian immigrant died after 
being beaten with a baseball bat and kicked by three men who may be 
skinheads young toughs blamed for violence against minorities 
around the nation police said 
two other ethiopian men friends who had dropped seraw off in 
front of his apartment early sunday were injured when they tried to 
intervene 
police said the attackers had shaved heads and wore military 
jackets investigators had no other leads police spokesman dave 
simpson said tuesday 
us attorney charles turner said investigators would try to 
determine whether there were any ties by the assailants to 
individuals or organizations outside the state and number two 
focus on the racial aspects of the killing 
elsewhere five teenagers who appeared to be linked to the 
skinhead movement were arrested in the vandalizing of a synagogue in 
san diego police said swastikas and hate slogans were painted on 
the outside walls of tiffereth israel synagogue early sunday and 
two cars and a home nearby were damaged 
they talked a little bit during questioning about skinhead 
activity and their knowledge of skinheads so we think theyre 
affiliated said san diego police capt mike tyler i certainly 
see that whole skinhead ideology in the incident he added that 
except for one girl they were not remorseful at all 
the five all 16 were booked for investigation of felony 
vandalisim of a place of worship with intent to intimidate 
in portland turner said that filing of federal civil rights 
charges would be considered only if state officials failed to pursue 
the more serious homicide charges and i dont expect that in this 
case he added 
mr turner has been very cooperative with us said betre 
melles of the ethiopian community organization i think that sends 
a message to the community 
seraws uncle engedaw berhanu of san francisco said the attack 
on his nephew was unprovoked i dont think we have any doubt that 
a brutal murder has been committed by some racial hate group he 
said 
of course it leaves us blacks in fear and uncertainty he 
said 
seraw immigrated from ethiopia seven years ago and worked at a 
car rental business 
skinheads have been linked to at least two other slayings the 
beating death in december of a black man in tampa fla and the 
stabbing in february of a white man who took a black friend to a 
party in santa clara county calif

leftist opposition parties were 
headed for victories in major cities today while president jose 
sarneys rightcentrist party suffered a major setback according to 
early election returns 
vote counting began at 8 am in most cities the early results 
confirmed exit polls tuesday that indicated a surprisingly strong 
showing by leftist and populist candidates 
the big surprise was the projected victory of luiza erundina of 
the socialistoriented workers party as mayor of sao paulo 
brazils largest city and financial center 
with 4 percent of the ballots counted ms erundina had 29 
percent of the vote while wealthy conservative industrialist paulo 
maluf had 25 percent 
ms erundina 53 is a social worker from brazils poor northeast 
region considered a militant within the party she has led land 
takeovers by poor squatters 
asked if she thought of herself as a radical ms erundina told 
reporters yes if it means defending workers rights 
the workers party led by former union president luiz inacio lula 
da silva also was expected to win mayoral elections in the state 
capitals of porto alegre and vitoria brazil has 26 states 
in rio brazils secondlargest city former mayor marcello 
alencar of the leftist democratic labor party held the lead with 4 
percent of the votes counted polls gave alencar 38 percent of the 
vote compared with 22 percent for the workers party 
in belo horizonte brazils no 3 city joao pimenta da veiga 
filho of the leftist brazilian social democracy party was the 
projected winner by a slim margin over the workers party 
the big loser appeared to be sarneys democratic movement party 
which was leading in four state capitals in the last municipal 
election in 1985 it won 17 
gov pedro simon of rio grande do sul state acknowledged his 
partys defeat but said at least now the voters cant blame us 
for everything that goes wrong with brazil 
conservative parties to the right of sarneys group were 
projected as winners in capitals of eight smaller mostly rural 
states other races were too close to call and results from some 
remote states in the amazon region were not in 
from the pampas to the far northern amazon jungle more than 75 
million brazilians waited in long lines under hot sun to choose from 
among 12 million candidates from 29 parties 
city streets were littered with pamphlets and streamers when the 
polling stations closed at 5 pm tuesday sealing elections for 
mayorships and city councils in 4307 cities and towns 
rep ulysses guimaraes leader of the democratic movement party 
called the election a fantastic spectacle of democracy 
the conservative mayor of sao paulo and former president janio 
quadros warned that the victory by leftwing candidates was a 
threat to democracy 
although voting was based largely on local matters political 
analysts say brazilians marked votes for or against sarneys party 
the democratic movement party has been blamed for 30 percent 
monthly inflation and a 40 percent dip in workers buying power and 
it has faced charges of corruption a recent wave of nationwide 
strikes has piled more criticism on the sarney government 
sarney a 58yearold politician and poet took office in 1985 as 
the running mate of tancredo neves who was chosen in a 
militarycontrolled electoral college vote neves died shortly 
before taking office 
the election was viewed as an important indicator of party 
popularity as brazil prepares for presidential elections in 1989 
the first such vote in 29 years 
federal troops were stationed in 15 states and 271 municipalities 
to keep order 
police arrested some campaign workers for violating a law 
prohibiting lastminute electioneering next to polling stations but 
no serious incidents were reported 
though voting is mandatory in brazil in recent weeks a campaign 
by a satirical newspaper urged voters to write in a chimpanzee in 
the rio zoo as mayor the measure was to register the general lack 
of confidence in politicians

the countrys largest 
antiapartheid group operated under the guidance of the outlawed 
african national congress a judge said today as a threeyear 
treason trial neared its end 
the 19 black activists on trial include senior leaders of the 
united democratic front a nowbanned coalition formed in 1983 to 
mobilize opposition to apartheid and whiteminority domination the 
defendants have denied allegations that they encouraged 
antigovernment violence 
supreme court justice kees van dijkhorst will issue his verdict 
within the next few days after he finishes reading aloud in court a 
1521page summary of the trial he began the process tuesday when 
he revoked the bail of eight of the defendants 
in the section of the summary read today van dijkhorst said he 
agreed with prosecutors that the united democratic front was 
supported and directed by the anc the countrys main 
antigovernment guerrilla movement 
the front has maintained it endorsed the african national 
congress political goals such as a oneperson onevote system 
but did not approve of the use of violence 
to side wholeheartedly with the anc and then to say that the 
udf is neutral is to twist that word out of joint van dijkhorst 
said 
he said the groups leaders had participated in rallies where 
crowds chanted in support of the anc and sang revolutionary 
songs 
a 1985 united democratic front statement calling for the 
collapse of the system was an unequivocal declaration of war on 
the state the judge said 
the three most prominent defendants at the trial are senior front 
leaders who have been denied bail throughout the trial and have 
spent 40 months in jail popo molefe 36 who was the groups 
national secretary terror lekota 40 its publicity secretary and 
moses chikane 40 secretary of the transvaal province branch 
all 19 defendants have pleaded innocent to charges of treason 
terrorism murder and subversion related to a central allegation 
that the front and its affiliates sought to promote violence to make 
south africa ungovernable 
the charges arise from violence and mob killings in black 
townships south of johannesburg in september 1984 the start of two

business inventories jumped 07 percent in 
september the 21st consecutive monthly increase while sales 
remained virtually unchanged the government said today 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots rose 55 billion to a seasonally adjusted 7494 billion 
while sales fell a scant 35 million to 4954 billion 
the combination of rising inventories and flat sales is a sign of 
economic weakness if the trend continued it could lead to fewer 
orders from retailers so they could sell off their backlog of 
goods and consequently to production cutbacks and layoffs at 
manufacturing plants 
however business sales have been generally strong this year and 
economists said the gain in inventories during most months was in 
line with sales 
the september inventory increase followed a large 11 percent 
gain in august and a 07 percent rise in july the last decline was 
in december 1986 
the small september decline in sales snapped a string of nine 
consecutive increases they had shot up 13 percent in august and 
rose a slight 01 percent in july 
inventory accumulation in september was led by a substantial 15 
percent rise at retailers where sales were the weakest wholesale 
inventories rose only 01 percent while inventories at factories 
increased 06 percent 
in sales a 01 percent dip at manufacturing plants and a 03 
percent decline at retail stores offset at 05 percent increase at 
the wholesale level sales have been particularly strong at the 
manufacturing level this year because of an export boom fueled by 
the lower value of the dollar 
an advance estimate of retail sales for october released 
tuesday showed a strong 09 percent gain evidence that the 
accumulation of inventories may have moderated somewhat as the 
fourth quarter began 
the combination of an increase in inventories and steady sales 
left the inventorytosales ratio at 151 in september up from 150 
during the three previous months that means it would take 151 
months to exhaust inventories at the september sales pace a ratio 
not considered unusually high

national security

surprise move by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev during a meeting 
with president reagan and bush in december wed welcome any kind 
of move by the soviets which is constructive he said there are 
many areas they have to move on i think they know that and if mr

were narrowed on airlaunched cruise missiles and on monitoring 
mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles if they are included in 
the treaty but he said a longstanding disagreement remains over the 
range an airlaunched cruise missile must have to be included in the 
treaty 
kampelman said no progress was made on sealaunched cruise 
missiles which moscow wants to limit 
he also said reagans strategic defense initiative program for 
spacebased missile defenses which the soviets oppose remains a 
serious objective and is not expected to be a bargaining chip 
under bush

regulations limiting aids testing for insurance 
were thrown out by massachusetts highest court today on grounds 
that the state insurance commissioner lacked authority to issue the 
rules 
authority to dictate such underwriting practices rests with the 
legislature the supreme court said today in a unanimous ruling 
insurance commissioner roger singer issued the regulations in 
1987 making massachusetts the second state behind new york to ban 
by regulation health insurance testing for aids antibodies 
under the regulations which never took effect aids testing was 
banned for all health insurance and group life and some disability 
insurance 
the life insurance association of massachusetts and several 
insurance companies sued to block the regulations in june a 
superior court judge ruled in favor of the insurance commissioner 
the high courts ruling today focused only on the industrys 
contention that singer lacked authority to issue the regulations 
the justices did not consider industry claims that the rules were 
arbitrary and interfered with the rights of people not infected with 
aids and the right of insurers not to enter into contracts 
singer claimed authority to issue the regulations under a 1924 
law outlining his duties but the court said it was doubtful the 
legislature intended that he be allowed to write regulations 
dictating underwriting practices 
we conclude that the commissioner had no authority express or 
implied to adopt the regulations challenged in this case justice

new york state health officials and gay 
rights activists won a court battle to prevent aids from being 
classified a communicable and sexually transmissible disease 
such a classification under the public health law would have 
required doctors to contact sexual partners of infected patients and 
would have given local health officials power to quarantine aids 
patients officials said 
justice f warren travers of new york states triallevel supreme 
court in a ruling made public tuesday rejected an attempt by 
doctors to force designation of the disease as sexually 
transmissible 
the lawsuit was brought by the medical society of the state of 
new york and other doctors groups against the state health 
department and its policysetting arm the state public health 
council 
by keeping aids off the list of sexually communicable diseases 
the health council has maintained it has been able to protect the 
confidentiality and rights of aids patients 
listing of aids which is transmitted primarily through sexual 
contact and the sharing of infected needles by drug abusers would 
do more harm than good they argued 
currently people who test positive for the virus in a voluntary 
test are counseled to encourage their sexual partners to be tested 
the gay mens health crisis in new york city called the court 
ruling a victory for both public health and common sense 
listing of aids as communicable would have completely eliminated 
voluntary and anonymous testing said thomas j sweeney the 
groups deputy executive director for policy 
health department spokesman peter slocum said he was delighted 
with the decision it rejects arguments based on ignorance and 
fear which would have called for the indiscriminate mass testing 
with no particular benefit he said 
frances tarlton health department spokeswoman said the 
department never denied that aids was sexually transmissible what 
the ruling means however is that health commissioner david axelrod 
has the authority to decide what diseases should be listed as 
reportable in the best way to protect the public 
bj costello a lawyer for the physicians groups said they 
would appeal he said there are vast numbers of people who have no 
idea they have the virus and physicians can do nothing when they 
see the symptoms 
my clients are committed to a solution that will alter current 
escalating figures of aids patients in the state costello said 
as of october new york state had about 19000 of the almost 75500 
diagnosed aids cases in the united states

but by then it was too late the stepfather had already been 
granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony 
against rosier james fitzpatrick said tuesday at rosiers trial for 
the murder of his wife patricia 
fitzpatrick chief investigator for the state attorneys office 
said he began his investigation in 1986 after rosier said in a tv 
interview that he helped his wife kill herself that same year 
the investigator knew that mrs rosiers stepfather vincent 
delman and his two sons might have seen the death and would be 
crucial witnesses 
but the delmans attorney said the three would testify against 
rosier only in exchange for total immunity prosecutors agreed 
fitzpatrick testified 
then farrell delman the elder of the two sons dropped a 
bombshell saying his father had smothered mrs rosier as she lay 
unconscious with the sons helping fitzpatrick said 
rosier earlier had injected his wife with morphine and given her 
morphine suppositories after she failed to kill herself with 
sedatives fitzpatrick testified 
but when those drugs also failed to kill her the delmans 
suffocated her he said 
fitzpatrick said he was shocked and angered by the revelation 
particularly since he had offered the delmans immunity but added 
we had two choices drop the case or grant them immunity you 
never enjoy giving immunity to felons we could not prosecute 
dr rosier without them even though we did not know about the final 
act 
moreover rosier is the one responsible fitzpatrick said 
he is the orchestrator he is the planner he got the drugs 
rosier is charged with murder attempted murder and conspiracy 
he said in an unpublished book that he was fulfilling his wifes 
wish to die with dignity 
earlier tuesday vincent delman testified he decided to smother 
mrs rosier with his bare hands in part because rosier was afraid 
his wife would end up a vegetable because the morphine had not 
worked

communist north korea renewed its call 
wednesday for highlevel political and military talks with rival 
south korea on ending military confrontation and easing tension on 
the divided peninsula 
in a letter delivered at the truce village of panmunjom north 
korean prime minister lee gun mo proposed urgent talks in 
middecember to clear the way for a summit 
the letter came on the eve of scheduled political discussions 
between lawmakers from the two countries 
lee proposed the december talks be held with deputy prime 
ministers and military chiefs of staff leading delegations of seven 
to nine members 
seoul officials said the north korean proposal offered nothing 
new and was aimed mainly at removing 42000 us soldiers stationed 
in south korea 
north korea is putting emphasis on removing us military 
forces in south korea the south korean unification ministry said 
lee said the north was seeking talks on a nov 7 communique 
which denounced the presence of us troops as the root cause of 
war and proposed phased withdrawl of american soldiers and the 
reduction of armed forces to no more than 100000 on each side by 
1992 
north korea has proposed talks involving the two koreas and the 
united states to ease tension but did not call for us 
participation in the december meeting 
lee said in his letter that easing military tension would be the 
first step to improving relations and the eventual reunification of 
the peninsula divided in 1945 when us and soviet troops ended 
japans colonial occupation 
unless we do this there cannot be substantial progress in 
seeking peace and peaceful reunification the letter said 
south and north korea in recent months have been swapping peace 
proposals as part of an apparent propaganda war 
north korera invaded south korea in 1950 sparking a threeyear 
war and the two sides have clashed sporadically with no peace 
treaty signed and hundreds of thousands of troops posed along their 
sealed border 
past negotiations on improving ties have failed 
representives from both parliaments are to resume talks thursday 
to clear the way for fullscale parliamentary negotiations 
in october north korea rejected south koreas call for 
sixnation talks involving the two koreas the united states the 
soviet union china and japan 
seoul officials believe the recent north korean peace overture 
appeared to have been promulgated out of jitters at south koreas 
diplomatic status bolstered by the successful staging of the 
olympics in seoul

tulsa okla world on the plo and israel 
to no ones surprise the palestine liberation organizations 
move to formally recognize israels right to exist was dismissed in 
advance by israels rightwing leadership it will not be so easily 
ignored in the united states 
the united states has always said it would not talk to the 
plo until it recognized israels right to exist now that such a 
step appears foregone what will be the united states response 
president reagan wisely reacted to the news with caution 
apparently there has been an indication theyre willing to abide 
by united nations resolution 242 the president said i hope 
that is true because it would be some progress 
caution is needed yasser arafat and other plo leaders speaking 
individually have made rather dramatic peace gestures in the past 
only to recant later

portland maine press herald on cost of supporting expresidents 
when ronald reagan officially retires from the presidency in 
january it will be the first time in this century that four 
expresidents will be living at the same time thats more than a 
historical footnote its a downright expensive proposition for 
american taxpayers 
in the 30 years since congress formaly inaugurated a program for 
the care and feeding of former presidents the cost has increased a 
hundredfold the government will spend about 40 million on former 
first families in 1989 15 million alone on reagans first year of 
retirement 
nobody begrudges secret service protection or the maintenance of 
postpresidential office facilities for former chief executives but 
the biggest expense to taxpayers has nothing to do with 
expresidential safety and comfort 
three dollars out of every five goes to maintain presidential 
libraries those combination archives and museums which have been 
springing up after every change of administration since herbert 
hoover 
the libraries themselves while built through private 
contributions are operated at taxpayer expense what started out as 
an annual 150000 stipend now runs into the tens of millions 
we need to take another look at the nations presidential library 
program with an eye to shifting more of the costs of operating them 
to private foundations 
otherwise let presidents simply turn their papers over to the 
national archives where they probably belong in the first place

rochester ny democrat and chronicle and timesunion on george 
bushs election and the deficit 
the foreign investors who bankroll americas spending binge to 
the tune of 100 billion a year dont care about george bushs 
read my lips pledge 
they care about their investments and thus about the federal 
budget deficit 
in the judgment of many economists the presidentelect will have 
only until early spring to make headway on reducing the deficit 
if he fails says c fred bergsten director of the institute for 
international economics look for a sharp fall in the dollar as 
much as 20 percent to 25 percent inflation doubledigit interest 
rates recession 
the new president will need great flexibility and bipartisan 
support to manage the deficit but bush has tied his own hands and 
alienated the congressional democrats whose support he needs 
if theres to be even a modest tax increase bush will have 
to do more than agree to it he will have to say read my lips i 
lied 
true there is a certain poetic justice to bushs predicament 
but soon he will be the president of all americans his predicament 
will be ours 
if hes willing to eat his words congress and the public

the evening sun baltimore on the resignation of william 
bradford reynolds the chief federal civil rights enforcer 
william bradford reynolds officially leaves the justice 
department on dec 9 and his legacy can be summed up in a single 
word bitterness 
as president reagans chief civil rights enforcer reynolds so 
alienated american blacks that they voted against reagan in 1984 by 
a margin of 9to1 that distrust continued to be reflected nov 8 
when blacks voted by nearly that same proportion against george 
bush even though bush once represented the kind of traditional 
moderate republicanism which only 30 years ago was drawing a 
respectable share of the black vote 
reynolds no doubt took seriously his obligation to enforce the 
law against such things as ku klux klan terrorism but this was 
offset by his extremely constricted view of the law he seemed to 
feel that an absence of discrimination was the end of the federal 
role in race relations out of this belief he became a militant 
indeed one could even say fanatic opponent of affirmative action 
in any meaningful form he did not seem to grasp the fact that 
positive programs had to be pursued to overcome the effects of 300 
years of slavery and segregation 
no task of the bush administration is more important than that of 
beginning to repair the immense damage done by william bradford 
reynolds in the past eight years

the tennessean nashville tenn on the homeless 
about 2000 people reflected credit on themselves and their 
nation the other day when they marched in washington dc to 
express concern for americas homeless 
some 377 of the marchers went one step further engaging in 
nonviolent civil disobedience by sitting down in the middle of a 
street they were arrested for disorderly conduct 
meanwhile in the city of brotherly love philadelphia 29 
homeless people occupy a federal building near the liberty bell 
they too were carted off to jail 
and in nashville on the same day almost 100 mourners turned out 
for the funeral of ms carol kessler a street person who had some 
in recent years to symbolize homelessness here 
it was fitting that the protest demonstrations occurred the day 
before the presidential election 
the plight of the homeless was largely ignored during the 
campaign by both parties and that is a shame it should be high on 
everyones list of priorities

the roman catholic church on wednesday 
criticized government plans to close the lenin shipyard the 
birthplace of the solidarity trade union 
it is not a matter for the church to enter the sphere of purely 
economic problems said a statement issued by the episcopate 
secretariat which represents roman catholic bishops nationwide 
the government decision to close down the gdansk shipyard is a 
political act not facilitating reconciliation 
the government announced the shipyard would be closed beginning 
dec 1 because it was losing money it now says closing the yard 
will take 1 years 
the church statement also expressed concern that the decision 
would block efforts to convene broadbased talks on polands future 
it has also led to withdrawing the talks at the round table and 
to blocking the emerging reconciliation of poles the statement 
said 
the authorities promised the talks during strikes in august the 
worst labor unrest in seven years 
but government objections to the proposed participaton of 
government critics and solidarity advisers adam michnik and jacek 
kuron have delayed the start of the talks 
solidarity leader lech walesa says he will not drop the two men 
because that would create a precedent 
the church statement also voiced disapproval of a strident media 
campaign against social and trade union pluralism 
the propaganda campaign against social pluralism especially 
against trade union pluraism which we have witnessed has not created 
a favorable climate for those roundtable talks it said 
the bishops called on authorities to fulfill a pledge to rehire 
workers dismissed from their jobs for participation in the august 
strikes saying failure to do so had diminished the states 
credibility with society and with the church 
solidarity was crushed in 1981 and outlawed the following year 
with the imposition of martial law 
in another development 51 activists continued a hunger strike 
wednesday to demand reinstatement of 49 miners and two steel workers 
they say have yet to be rehired after the august strikes 
the workers were holed up in christ the king cathedral in the 
southern city of katowice where they took shelter friday night 
during a demonstration

burning bits of newly harvested cotton 
carried by swirling winds spread fire through the city destroying 
at least 29 houses and businesses injuring 18 people and keeping up 
to 400 from their homes today 
the winds that had gusted to 65 mph and spread flames tuesday 
were tame today as police and firefighters conducted a 
housetohouse search of the charred commercial and residential 
area no bodies were found officials said 
i cant imagine anyone thinking up a scenario like this where 
there would be a fire break out in a field of cotton modules when 
the wind is blowing 60 miles per hour it sounds like a scene out of 
a horror movie said gov henry bellmon after a tour of the area 
this morning 
the fire whose cause was unknown spread to the city from giant 
bundles of cotton stored in an open field 
the fire skipped like a tornado through the residential area 
burning some houses and leaving others unscathed the oklahoma 
highway patrol said 
the destroyed cotton was probably worth about 3 million police 
chief jim hughes said he said 25 homes and four businesses were 
destroyed and about 100 homes damaged by smoke but he was unable to 
estimate the cost of the damage 
the blaze also destroyed a radio station transmitter and forced 
the evacuation of two elementary schools and about 400 residents of 
this southwest oklahoma city of 23000 most evacuees were allowed 
to return home by midday 
eighteen people were treated tuesday for smoke inhalation with 
two admitted to the hospital as a precaution jackson county 
memorial hospital said 
the smoke along with winds gusting from 50 mph to 65 mph made 
firefighting difficult and could be seen from 30 miles away 
we couldnt see a hand or foot in front of our face said 
firefighter eddie williamson we had to feel from house to house 
the cotton smoldering in the field looked like the last logs on a 
huge campfire with the soft red afterglow of embers here and there 
across the field 
those modules will burn probably two days weve got a whole 
field of cotton modules burning altus civil defense director 
dwight dennis said 
the giant bales or nodules were about 40 feet long 8 feet high 
and 8 feet wide said city administrator joe courtney they were 
awaiting processing at a cotton gin 
courtney said the city will seek state aid 
the cause of the fire had not been determined its not 
uncommon for a module to selfignite under certain situations 
courtney said it might sit out there and smother for two days and 
we might not even be aware of it 
altus firefighter clay richardson said that when he arrived about 
50 minutes after the blaze was reported 50 mph gusts kept 
firefighters from being able to train water on the fire 
there was fire all around us richardson said we didnt 
know where to go it seemed like mass confusion 
the blaze crossed us highway 283 and destroyed a garden tool 
shop a moving and storage company a motel a number of homes and 
damaged part of a mobile home park officials said 
when it crossed the highway thats when it got out of 
control richardson said all of the sudden it was phoom the 
wind was spreading debris 
richardson said many firefighters suffered eye injuries from 
blowing smoke and debris including himself 
city park crews and security officers from altus air force base 
helped evacuate residents some stayed at motels or with friends or 
relatives about 65 were registered tuesday evening to stay at a red 
cross shelter 
one of those evacuated joan smith said most of the people in 
the shelter had homes to return to but a few with small children 
were not so fortunate 
some of the people came in here and i heard them say that 
their home is burned up she said i was just heartbroken

tue nguyen did more than nibble from the tree of 
knowledge he made a feast of it 
just nine years after arriving in this country with thousands of 
other vietnamese boat people nguyen 26 has earned his seventh 
degree from the massachusetts institute of technology a doctorate 
in nuclear engineering the school says it thinks that is a record 
for mit 
nguyen told the mit public relations office that he earned 
multiple degrees to get the most out of my time at mit and out of 
my tuition 
he also said he isnt a partygoer 
the super scholar was in burlington vt this week preparing to 
start a job at ibm designing technology for the manufacture of 
semiconductor devices he did not return telephone calls from the 
associated press but one of his fans back in cambridge was happy to 
crow about him 
youre not likely to find another person like this very 
often said nuclear engineering professor sidney yip nguyens 
doctoral adviser 
hes a very quiet guy very laid back said yip but as 
you can imagine deep down he has a lot of will power 
nguyen entered mit in 1981 by taking up to 12 courses a semester 
instead of the normal mit student load of four he earned his first 
undergraduate degree in three years and finished up four more 
bachelors degrees in one more year he then began his graduate work 
he was so busy attending classes that he had difficulty doing his 
homework assignments yip said 
he holds bachelors degrees in physics in computer science and 
engineering in electrical engineering in mathematics and in 
nuclear engineering he got his masters in nuclear engineering in 
1986 and finished work on his doctorate in nuclear engineering this 
fall 
but that was only what he learned at mit he also studied english 
in texas and chinese at harvard the latter being the language of 
his fiancees family nguyen and two younger brothers left vietnam 
in 1978 his father a retired government employee and mother 
remain in vietnam with two other sons and a daughter 
after three days at sea packed into a small boat with 300 other 
refugees the brothers arrived in malaysia and spent nine months in 
a refugee camp a church group rescued them by sponsoring their 
passage to pasadena texas where they moved in with relatives 
nguyen enrolled at a junior college in the houston suburb mainly 
to learn english 
at 19 he entered mit 
his brothers have kept busy too tien nguyen 25 is earning a 
doctorate in nuclear engineering at mit and tai nguyen 22 is 
doing graduate work at the university of california in berkeley 
while nguyen has a great deal of scientific curiosity yip 
said he worries about him 
he has in some sense not really known the outside world he 
spent most of his time in an academic environment so how he thrives 
in the next period of his career will take some adjusting

bulgarian people for saving 50000 jews in 1943 from the holocaust 
addressing a symposium organized by bulgarian officials and the 
nations tiny jewish community shulamit shamir said israel would 
never forget what bulgaria had done 
glory to the noble bulgarian people and may it be blessed 
she said 
her tribute came as israel is seeking to restore ties to soviet 
bloc countries which with the exception of romania severed 
diplomatic ties with israel over the middle east war in 1967 
the twoday symposium on bulgarias rescue of its jews from 
deportation to nazi death camps is the first time the effort has 
been marked with an international gathering of jewish leaders in 
bulgaria 
leaders of the countrys 3000member jewish community were 
present as the symposium opened amid fanfare showing it had support 
from the communist leadership 
bulgarias longtime leader todor zhivkov is among those given 
credit for saving the countrys estimated 50000 jews from 
deportation and she said she hoped she could thank him in person 
in her speech she also expressed hope the relations between 
israel and bulgaria will intensify to the extent of matching the 
strength of the historical bond between the bulgarian and the jewish 
peoples 
we shall remember this forever she told the conference in 
bulgarian referring to the rescue 
the nazis had planned to deport thousands of bulgarian jews to 
death camps in poland on barges of death anchored at ports on 
the danube mrs shamir said 
and then a historical miracle happened she said everybody 
witnessed how a whole people of intellectuals and workers peasants 
and townfolk the church the holy synod men and women rose to 
save their jewish compatriots against the wish of the fascist 
authorities at this hellish time 
the bulgarians are credited with foiling the plans of their king 
boris iii and his naziallied government to deport bulgarian jews 
following the deportation of 11000 jews in the spring of 1943 from 
macedonia and thrace to the south 
members of the countrys parliament turned against the government 
to protest deportation orders and zhivkov is credited with helping 
to organize a demonstration of 10000 people against the 
deportations 
the tide then started to turn against the nazis on the eastern 
front where the soviets dealt adolf hitlers armies a decisive 
defeat at kursk and german representatives in bulgaria told berlin 
they could no longer pressure the bulgarian government into carrying 
out the deportations 
after world war ii ended the communists took power and most of 
bulgarias 50000 jews emigrated to israel 
jewish leaders from britain france east germany hungary and 
italy also attended and bnai brith sent representatives from the 
united states 
mrs shamir is on her second visit to bulgaria since she left at 
the age of 17 in 1941 for palestine leaving all her family behind 
all her relatives survived the holocaust

the state department said today the new policy 
declaration by the palestine liberation organization parliament in 
exile does not satisfy us requirements for the opening of a 
dialogue with the plo 
spokesman charles redman said the results of the palestine 
national council session in algiers fall short of administration 
conditions 
he said the pnc endorsement of un security council resolutions 
to achieve a comprehensive middle east settlement was an advance 
over previous plo statements but was ambiguous in its meaning and 
its placement in the text he refused to elaborate 
the pncs indirect acknowledgement of israels right to exist 
also was insufficient redman said 
recognition must be clear and unambiguous he said adding 
that plo repudiation of terrorist activities against civilian 
targets was a restatement of previous positions 
it is still performance that counts redman said 
the us position on dealing with the plo is that no dialogue can 
take place until the plo accepts un resolutions 242 and 338 
recognizes israels right to exist and renounces terrorism 
the policy has been maintained since the ford administration 
despite the negative assessment the spokesman said there were 
some encouraging signs coming out of the pnc meeting 
he said there were indications that some palestinians are 
trying to move the plo in a constructive way thats encouraging and 
should continue 
on tuesday the administration rejected the plo proclamation of 
an independent state but saw as a positive sign its acceptance of 
the un resolutions 
but officials noted that whatever conclusions are drawn by the 
administration would not necessarily be binding on presidentelect 
george bush who takes office in nine weeks 
on tuesday flatly rejected the pnc call for an independent 
palestinian state although the document was not explicit on this 
point the state apparently would encompass the west bank and gaza 
strip which have been under israeli control since 1967 
redman said the status of territories under israeli occupation 
cannot be determined by unilateral acts of either side but only 
through a process of negotiations a declaration of independent 
palestinian statehood is such a unilateral act 
our objective is a comprehensive peace redman said direct 
negotiations must be at heart of the negotiating process 
palestinian participation is required at every stage of 
negotiations all participants in the negotiations must renounce 
terrorism and violence and each must agree on the accepted 
international basis of un security council resolutions 242 and 
338 
the plo declaration renounces terrorist activities against 
civilian targets but the administration insists the plo must 
foreswear all terrorist activities among other conditions as the 
price for opening negotiations with that group 
the administration was more ambivalent in its attitude toward the 
outcome of the algiers meeting than was israel whose prime 
minister yitzhak shamir ruled out all negotiations with the plo 
because they are opposed to peace with israel 
theodore ellenoff president of the american jewish committee 
said the pnc declaration does nothing to move the arabisraeli 
dispute toward direct negotiations 
i see this as a political circus the goal of which is to 
encourage international statesmen into believing there has been 
movement embracing peace when actually it is nothing of the sort 
ellenoff said 
but michael lerner of the american jewish magazine tikkun said 
the pncs acceptance of the un resolutions constitute a historic 
and welcome change despite the ambiguity of the statement 
israel can no longer claim that there is no one to talk to 
he said

supermarket produce counters are taking on a 
special look these days with bean sprouts bok choy guava and 
other exotic items catching the eye of food shoppers an agriculture 
department economist said wednesday 
specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part 
of the new upscale image of many produce sections said catherine 
greene of the departments economic research service 
rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general 
increase in fruit and vegetable consumption she said on the 
average americans consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last 
year up 12 percent since 1972 that is a farm weight equivalent 
before trimming processing and afterharvest losses she said 
greene said the per capita trend is expected to continue upward 
although there could be some yeartoyear variations for example 
she said this years drought probably will cause some decline from 
the 1987 average 
in any case specialty fruits and vegetables are the rage among 
many consumers and there is no sign the demand will taper off soon 
greene writing in the agencys national food review said there are 
a number of reasons 
americans have become more health conscious eating lots of 
fruits and vegetables as part of a wellbalanced diet she said 
consequently we want a huge selection of produce 
further americans travel more frequently than they used to and 
many want foreign foods when they return home 
unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant 
menus greene said also influencing our diets are recent 
immigrants from the caribbean central america and southeast asia 
who have brought their native foods with them 
a recent survey by the industrys food marketing institute showed 
that the number of items sold in supermarket produce departments 
more than doubled to 150 between the mid1970s and the early 1980s 
today more than 250 items is the norm including new packs and 
sizes of traditional fruits and vegetables along with exotic and 
specialty produce 
another survey conducted for a trade journal the packer showed 
the most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa 
and bean sprouts followed by snow peas pearl onions parsnips 
leeks baby vegetables chinese cabbage and shallots 
moreover about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard 
of less widely known specialty vegetables such as belgian endive 
bok choy celeriac daikon kohlrabi parsley root and jerusalem 
artichoke 
the most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits in order were 
pomegranates persimmons kumquats quince and guavas 
additionally at least a third of those surveyed had seen or 
heard of breadfuit passion fruit plantains prickly pear and red 
bananas but some fruits were nearly unkown asian pears 
carambolas cherimoyas sapotes radiccho and rappini 
greene said the survey showed that consumers in the western 
united states are more likely to try specialty produce and fresh 
herbs another group of growth items one factor is the wests large 
asian and hispanic populations with their interests in exotic 
produce 
also it was shown that consumers in the upper income brackets 
eat more of the speciality fruits and vegetables 
they may be better informed about the variety of produce 
available and better able to afford the premium prices that 
specialities sometimes command greene said

jewish settlers in this small 
hilltop town south of jerusalem dismiss the palestinian declaration 
of independence as just talk but rightwing leaders are calling 
for annexing parts of the occupied areas 
hardline likud trade minister ariel sharon said the declaration 
was a dangerous development and israel should respond by 
annexing parts of the occupied west bank and gaza strip where 15 
million palestinians live 
in response to the declaration the militant tzomet party headed 
by former chief of staff rafael eytan vowed to move its headquarters 
from tel aviv to arab east jerusalem captured in 1967 from jordan 
and later annexed by israel 
those asking for war will get it a party statement said 
but a spokesman for the farright tehiya party avi farhan said 
they are declaring declarations while we are creating facts they 
are making statements in algeria but we are building settlements 
about 70000 israelis live in more than 130 settlements in the 
occupied territories settler leaders have called for building 50 
more in the next three years the united states views such 
settlements as obstacles to peace 
in efrat a settlement of 340 families located six miles south of 
jerusalem most people seemed only vaguely aware of the palestine 
national councils declaration in algeria 
on that meeting well we won this country by war and the 
bible says we were here beforehand so i dont really understand why 
the arabs think this is their land said eran chemsky a high 
school student sitting on a park bench next to a young woman 
knitting a skull cap 
its all talk just talk said a woman riding the bus from 
jerusalem to the settlement 
town administrator bob lang an americanborn immigrant said 
settlers have become accustomed to tight security in the town and 
the risks of driving along the roads into jerusalem where they go 
to shop and work hundreds of israeli travelers have been injured in 
stoning attacks in the 11monthold uprising 
they have even gotten used to the reluctance and outright refusal 
of many friends and relatives to visit for fear palestinians will 
hurl rocks or firebombs on their cars he said 
thats the biggest problem he said 
a restaurant owner who refused to give her name said she worries 
because three of her daughters travel daily to schools outside the 
settlement but she said her family cannot move because we have 
nowhere else to go theyre throwing rocks in central israel also

the operating rate at us factories mines and 
utilities in october rose to the highest level in 8 years the 
government said wednesday in a report that stirred new concern about 
inflation 
the federal reserve board said american industry used 840 
percent of its capacity last month up from 838 percent in 
september it was the largest increase since july and the highest 
level since february 1980 
capacity use has grown or held steady for eight consecutive 
months creeping ever closer to the 85 percent threshold that 
economists believe signals a pickup in inflation 
as capacity increases factories can have trouble producing 
enough goods to meet demand leading to shortages and higher prices 
the hike is yet another sign of an increasingly fully 
employed economy where substantial inflationary pressure is 
building said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
although american businesses have spent heavily this year on new 
equipment to expand production sinai said increased capacity is 
slow to come on line 
the rise in the operating rate last month followed a month of no 
change in september a 01 percentage point gain in august and a 
sharp 07 percentage point rise in july 
at manufacturing plants the operating rate rose to 843 percent 
last month up from 841 percent in september and the highest since 
july 1979 all of that increase was attributable to producers of 
durable goods big ticket items intended to last three or more 
years 
the durable goods rate jumped from 826 percent to 830 percent 
while the rate for nondurable goods held steady at 862 percent 
the rate at motor vehicle and parts plants shot up for the third 
month in a row hitting 844 percent last month up from 826 
percent in september the highest since 1985 however the federal 
reserve said the rate was still well below the 933 percent peak 
reached in 1978 
john hagens an economist with the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa forecasting firm said he saw some small sign of optimism 
in the capacity report because the growth came in industries with 
more room to expand 
the mix is in the right direction away from nondurables and 
toward the durables he said its a high number but its not as 
high as its been at the end of previous expansions 
the operating rate at utilities was 808 percent last month up 
from 806 percent in september it hit a peak for the year in august 
of 839 percent because of a surge in electricity use during the 
summer heat wave 
in the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling the 
operating rate slipped from 824 percent in september to 818 
percent in october us oil drilling activity has waned in response 
to a decline in world oil prices

presidentelect george bush has tapped feisty 
gov john sununu as his chief of staff sources say a signal of 
change after his first two top appointments went to reagan 
administration veterans 
bush today attended a colorful white house ceremony welcoming 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who told reporters i 
think were all very fortunate in the western world that bush will 
be ronald reagans successor 
their styles will be different she said but for the first 
time we shall have continuity of policies stretching over a second 
presidency and that gives enormous stability and confidence to 
the feeling of the world 
bush was meeting later today with soviet physicist and former 
prisoner of conscience andrei sakharov 
meanwhile bushs transition cochairmen craig fuller and robert 
teeter announced a raft of additions to the transition team they 
also told reporters that all transition staff members would be 
required to sign an ethics form pledging them not to leak 
information and to avoiding the appearance of conflictsofinterest 
asked about bushs decision to make sununu chief of staff fuller 
said he had raised the issue with the vice president today 
let them know that when i am ready to make an announcement 
theyll hear it from me fuller quoted bush as saying but fuller 
said he did not know whether bush had made the decision 
in concord today sununu did not deny reports that he will become 
chief of staff at a news conference he refused to confirm the 
reports saying any word would have to come from bush 
a request isnt a formal request until the tall thin guy 
sings he said 
the transition office released the names of key people who will 
serve under fuller and teeter they include michael farren deputy 
director tom collamore and kathleen shanahan liaisons with the 
vice presidents office david demarest director of public affairs 
janet mullins congressional relations jim pinkerton policy 
development and david ryder management 
other top staff positions were announced earlier they were c 
boyden gray counsel fred fielding director of the office of the 
vice presidentelect chase untermeyer personnel and sheila tate 
spokeswoman 
on tuesday after flying home from a fourday florida vacation 
with sununu in tow bush met with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
and announced treasury secretary nicholas brady as the second 
occupant of his cabinet he said he was not prepared to announce his 
chief of staff but it might be fairly soon 
sources close to bush who insisted on anonymity said the choice 
of sununu was already made with the nod going to the 49yearold 
lame duck new hampshire governor who helped bush bounce back from a 
defeat in the iowa caucuses last february 
the bluntspoken sununu a onetime engineering professor was an 
indefatigable bush campaigner often employed as a surrogate to 
attack gov michael dukakis the democratic nominee and his claims 
of a massachusetts miracle 
the sununu choice should cheer conservatives worried that the 
pivotal white house job would fall to fuller chief of bushs vice 
presidential staff for the last four years and regarded as more of a 
moderate and pragmatist fuller may be in line for a cabinet post 
possibly transportation he is expected to disdain working under 
sununu at the white house 
but fuller discounted that assessment saying he had only good 
working relations with the new hampshire politician 
sununus selection would leave bush with a righthand aide with 
no washington experience sununus government experience consists of 
six years as chief executive of one of the smallest states in the 
union a father of eight sununu decided against seeking a fourth 
term this fall largely for financial reasons 
brady 58 former chairman of the investment banking house of 
dillon read amp co joins james a baker iii the secretary of 
statedesignate as a cornerstone member of the bush cabinet brady 
took over the treasury department post in august when baker quit to 
run bushs campaign 
bush said brady will be the chief economic spokesman for my 
administration 
he knows that our most important priority is to keep our 
economy growing with low inflation and that we must resist the 
policies that will impede that effort such as raising taxes or 
resorting to protection 
bush added that brady also knows weve got to sit down with the 
congress and hammer out a budget deficit reduction agreement and 
that we have to do it soon 
im putting together a good team here said bush youll 
see some continuity and youll see some change 
sununu flew to florida on monday for a private dinner with bush 
at a friends beach home where the bushes took their postelection 
respite 
at a dinner tuesday night honoring bushs wife barbara for her 
crusade against illiteracy bush joked that he had not quite been 
able to escape the media on his vacation

all shining examples of those thousand points of light weve been 
hearing a lot about lately 
bush taking up that theme said the entire audience of literacy

a thousand points of light reaching out to help someone else 
with his wife now freed from campaigning he said now its

arizonas board of pharmacy today asked rj 
reynolds co to voluntarily withdraw its smokeless cigarette 
from testmarketing in phoenix and tucson pending a determination of 
whether it is a drug 
the agency acted after the american medical association 
petitioned the board and missouris health department arguing the 
premier cigarette is a new hazardous drug that should be banned 
by the food and drug administration 
rj reynolds attorney jack la sota had asked the board to delay 
any action on premier cigarettes which are also being testmarketed 
in st louis until the fda makes its own determination of the 
tobacco products classification 
he said a decision is expected by the end of his year 
the premier is low in smoke and ash because the tobacco is 
warmed not burned the cigarette also consists of a tobacco 
flavoring capsule like conventional cigarettes the premier also 
contains nicotine 
for that reason the medical association has called it a 
drugdelivery system that falls under the jurisdiction of the 
fda 
timothy j agan an assistant attorney general said the boards 
enforcement options if it were to determine that the product is a 
drug would include seeking an injunction against its sale as the 
ama requested 
the board would have to go to court because only the fda has the 
power to declare a product a drug and regulate it he said 
la sota left immediately after the board decision and was 
unavailable for comment 
ruth iliff a spokeswoman at the arizona cancer center read a 
letter from the centers director dr sydney e salmon calling the 
effort to introduce premier in arizona an insidious attack on 
public health 
salmons letter said billing the product as a cigarette is an 
effort to escape from just regulatory and investigational 
procedures

had belonged to james madison the fourth president and originally 
hung in madisons virginia home said james miller an auctioneer at 
sothebys 
the painting shows the president looking old and tired and 
dressed in a dark blue coat and white neck cloth its authenticity 
was confirmed by marvin sadik an art historian who is an expert on 
washington portraits said miller who conducted the auction 
sothebys estimated its value at only 54000 to 90500 because

painted after washington died in 1799 miller said 
the british seller who was not identified picked it up rather 
cheaply at another new york auction house he said 
the firm said the owner brought the portrait to london for 
auction because he thought it would have a more unusual impact 
here miller said it was included in a sale of british 
paintings which brought nearly 145 million

two groups representing colleges and 
universities on wednesday called for an end to the hype over 
school ratings based primarily on how well incoming students score 
on entrance exams 
the american council on education and the college board said 
undue emphasis on such rankings is causing some collegebound youth 
to mistakenly think they arent good enough for universities with 
high scores and to overlook fine schools where scores are lower 
test results are only one indicator of the quality of incoming 
students and the quality of incoming students does not 
necessarily say anything useful about the quality of what goes on in 
a college or university the two groups said in an open letter to 
schools and education officials 
the organizations reiterated their recommendation that schools 
report incoming students test scores in ranges such as the highest 
and lowest scores of the middle 50 percent of their freshman class 
rather than giving an average test result 
the use of test score data in isolation as a measure of 
quality with which to compare or ranklist colleges is a clear 
misuse which should be curbed the letter said 
college board president donald m stewart said at a news 
conference that the letter was designed to diffuse some of the 
hype over college guidebooks and other reports that rank colleges 
primarily on how their incoming students fare on standardized exams 
such as the scholastic aptitude test and the american college test 
students should be looking at institutions because theyre 
exciting places and they want to be there not because theyre no 1 
on a bloody chart stewart said the whole teaching and 
learning processes are being distorted 
robert h atwell president of the american council on education 
said he was very concerned about the guidebook phenomenon 
he said rankings by test scores can be misleading since schools 
may include different categories of students in their averages for 
example some leave out athletes and other specialadmittance 
groups he said 
you can move up and down one of those lists almost 
whimsically or accidentally atwell said 
as colleges compete for dwindling numbers of high school 
graduates they place too much importance on getting a good ranking 
and sometimes tout high scores even while knowing full well the 
limitations of such lists he added

the government on wednesday 
pledged to crack down on rightwing extremists after a shooting 
rampage by a white supremacist left six blacks dead in downtown 
pretoria 
barend strydom the 23yearold arrested after the shootings 
quit the national police force in february while facing misconduct 
charges at the time strydom said officers searching his home had 
found a photograph showing him with a knife in one hand and a black 
mans severed head in the other 
four men and two women were killed in the midafternoon shooting 
spree tuesday and 16 people 15 blacks and one asian were 
wounded witnesses said the gunman laughed as he fired at his 
victims with an automatic pistol from close range over a 15minute 
period before he was arrested 
i could never shoot a white man the gunman reportedly told 
officers who drove him away as angry blacks surged around a police 
van 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said strydom was a member of 
the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement and claimed to be the 
leader of a rightwing vigilante group called the white wolves 
anonymous telephone callers have claimed responsibility on behalf of 
the white wolves for recent arson and bomb attacks on offices of 
antiapartheid groups 
vlok and police commissioner hennie de witt said police had 
started an investigation of the extreme right 
officers also are investigating an anonymous telephone call to a 
newspaper by a man who said president pw botha might be 
assassinated if he announced the release of jailed african national 
congress leader nelson mandela the african national congress is the 
main antigovernment guerrilla group in south africa 
defense minister magnus malan said wednesday that stricter 
security measures including body searches would be used at public 
meetings 
local newspapers reported that strydom issued a statement after 
he quit the police force in the statement he reportedly said police 
had confiscated documents from his home related to the afrikaner 
resistance movement and had found the photograph of him holding the 
severed head 
the purpose of the photograph was to frame it with the heading 
anc beware strydom said in the statement the head reportedly 
was that of a man killed in a traffic accident 
the afrikaner resistance movement declined to comment on 
tuesdays shootings but it issued a statement urging botha not to 
release mandela because a black eruption might ensue 
botha has said mandelas release is under consideration but has 
indicated he wants some type of concession from the black leader 
who is serving a life sentence for plotting antigovernment sabotage 
the pretoria rampage was mentioned wednesday at a congress of 
bothas national party when one delegate roger ogies urged the 
government to ban the afrikaner resistance movement 
we are not believed by blacks when we say we will act against 
radicals both to the left and the right ogies said 
more than 20 black antiapartheid organizations have been banned 
this year under stateofemergency regulations imposed by botha in 
june 1986 to end antigovernment unrest in black townships 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no say in 
national affairs 
strydom was described by witnesses as a handsome solidly built 
man with a blond moustache 
igshaan hoosen a radio shop salesman in pretoria said the 
gunman wearing a camouflage jacket walked over to a woman 
pointed a pistol at her body and shot her in the side her little 
boy stood there dumbstruck 
laughing openly the gunman then walked along a street in front 
of the state theater firing more shots at pointblank range hoosen 
said 
he said the gunman calmly removed the empty clip from his 9mm 
pistol and reloaded he walked two more blocks where other 
witnesses said he continued to smile and fire at blacks until he was 
detained 
one of those killed was piet mbedzi a 59yearold street cleaner 
with 11 children

more than 70 million worth of fragrant 
douglas and noble firs are being cut and bundled as oregon growers 
ready themselves for the christmas season 
with an expected harvest of 72 million trees this year oregon 
remains the nations single largest supplier of christmas trees 
prices remain about the same as last year for premium trees with 
6foot to 7foot douglas firs bringing growers around 11 said 
bryan ostlund spokesman for the northwest christmas tree 
association in salem 
slowergrowing noble firs bring a higher price he said while 
retail prices are at least double what growers receive 
california is the chief market for oregon trees but they also 
are shipped to east coast and even tropical destinations 
but growers with lowerquality trees are encountering buyer 
resistance because of a plentiful supply of premium wellshaped 
trees ostlund said 
others in the business say an oversupply of trees is hurting 
sales 
steve woodard lane county extension forester said an oversupply 
has been predicted for a number of years and began showing up last 
year 
theres way way more trees in the ground than will ever find a 
market he said 
many smaller christmas tree plantings will probably be left 
unharvested to grow into timber woodard said 
people get out and plant two or five acres of trees and dont 
take care of them he said the trees are not sheared and they 
wont sell but the big growers are dead serious about the business 
they produce quality wellshaped trees and they have their own 
market contacts

women who take birth control pills face double the 
usual chance of heart disease but their increased risk goes away as 
soon as they stop taking the pill a study concludes 
although the link between heart trouble and current pill use is 
known experts were unsure whether this increased risk lingered 
after women stopped taking the pill 
the latest study based on the longrunning nurses harvard medical 
school concludes that former phealth study 
atill takers have no 
more than the usual risk of heart trouble 
the study found that pill users are 2 times more likely than 
nonusers the same age to have heart attacks and strokes however 
their risk was still extremely low 
the adverse effects of the pill could be potentially more 
important if they continue after women stop using this form of birth 
control former users are older and are already at higher risk of 
heart trouble even a moderate increase in this hazard could be 
significant 
women who have used oral contraceptives in the past do not have 
to be concerned that this will raise their risk of cardiovascular 
disease said dr meir j stampfer

drug manufacturers and others concerned about 
developing new medicines called for major reforms wednesday in a 
legal system that allows multimilliondollar awards against drug 
companies 
legal and medical experts told reporters the battle against aids 
and other diseases will be hampered until manufacturers can be 
better protected in lawsuits against drugs that have been approved 
by federal authorities 
the current climate has created strong disincentives to conduct 
research and development in certain highrisk areas including the 
search for a cure to acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids 
said bruce j brennan of the pharmaceutical manufacturers 
association 
the american medical association in june passed a resolution 
saying that biomedical research was deteriorating in certain fields 
because of the unavailability of product liability insurance the 
organizations 420member house of delegates called for broad tort 
reform 
huge jury awards in cases involving drugs approved by the food 
and drug administration already have caused some drugs to be removed 
from the market and limited availability of others to a single 
manufactuer brennan said 
one must ask whether it makes any sense to have fdas decisions 
secondguessed by lay juries he said 
brennan said fda approval of a drug should be made a strong 
defense in product liability action unless the drug manufacturer 
can be shown to have committed fraud on the fda in obtaining 
approval or negligence in manufacture or distribution of the drug 
groups representing lawyers have argued that limiting liability 
would be denying victims of dangerous drugs their rights to redress 
under the legal system 
ross h weaver technology manager for the american medical 
association said reasonable guidelines are needed for pain and 
suffering awards which have escalated in recent years to several 
million dollars 
we need to compensate but we also need to ensure that new 
products stay available for those who need them he said 
george frazza general counsel for drug manufacturer johnson amp 
johnson said that whenever a drug comes out relating to the 
reproductive system lawyers are swarming all over 
he said most juries will make awards based on scientific 
evidence but with some drugs facing hundreds of suits across the 
country all it takes to inhibit the manufacturer is one jury ruling 
in favor of the plaintiff with a large award 
frazza suggested that a system be set up in which courts could 
take testimony from a recognized scientific panel rather than from 
experts hired by the prosecution and defense who simply contradict 
each other

a member of the soviet unions 
politburo urged publication of different opinions whether you 
like them or not in an interview published wednesday by the 
communist party daily rude pravo 
also wednesday the communist party weekly tribuna accused 
independent groups that have become increasingly active in the 
soviet bloc of seeking legalization to legally subvert socialism 
in the rude pravo interview alexander n yakovlev a close 
adviser to president mikhail s gorbachev appeared to criticize the 
staterun media in the east bloc for failing to report more 
extensively on developments in other countries 
i think that our journalists should publish more actively 
information about the situation in other countries it seems to me 
that there exist many reserves yakovlev said 
we write about life only formally like in a protocolbut we 
can nowhere read about what is interesting everywhere in your 
country in our country or in the countries of our neighbors he 
told four czechoslovak reporters also representing the state news 
agency ctk and state radio and television 
he also said if you profess democracy open information you 
should also publish different opinions whether you like them or 
not 
the one thing we must not allow are factual inaccuracies 
yakovlev said 
the tribuna article said independent groups such as solidarity 
in poland or the recently established league of free democrats in 
hungary as well as independent groups in czechoslovakia sought to 
create the bourgeois type of a plural system 
it was written by the editor in chief karel horak 
according to ctk which carried excerpts horak made clear that 
independent groups in czechoslovakia would not be allowed to gain 
the kind of political footing a number of groups have achieved in 
neighboring hungary 
the attack came less than a week after yakovlev told journalists 
in hungary that each countrys leadership should decide for itself 
the question of introducing a multiparty system 
the hungarian government last week approved draft legislation 
that could pave the way for a multiparty system 
czechoslovak authorities have taken a particularly tough stand 
lately on dissent cracking down on independent groups and using 
police force to break up banned rallies 
from a historical point of view opposition under socialism can 
only be antisocialist horak wrote 
however yakovlev in a speech at the communist party school in 
prague on tuesday defended socialist pluralism 
the conflict of opinions emotions and interests is 
inevitable he said 
he indicated that communist leaders and citizens must seek to 
establish a compromise or consensus 
we evaluate the art of political leadership by the ability to 
make sure there are no people who disagree in the main and 
fundamental no people who are rejected separated from the society 
or separating the society yakovlev said

leaders of a new coalition said wednesday they 
represent more than 1 million israeli and american jews who oppose 
ultraorthodox efforts to enforce strict observance of the sabbath 
and change the rules of conversion 
founding members are the american jewish congress the 
association of americans and canadians in israel three leftleaning 
israeli political parties and 18 other groups 
a travesty is being played out on judaism in israel and around 
the world said rabbi philip spectre head of the coalition and 
director of the jerusalembased israel movement for progressive 
judaism 
his 12000member group is israels equivalent of the american 
reform movement 
in an interview he said of the ultraorthodox this is a breed 
of orthodox that is extremist it threatens to push us into a 
neanderthal system 
spectre told a news conference the coalition will lobby 
parliament to oppose demands of the ultraorthodox 
religious parties won 18 of the 120 parliament seats in the nov 
1 elections and probably will hold the balance of power in a 
coalition government being formed by prime minister yitzhak shamir 
of the rightwing likud bloc 
in exchange for ultraorthodox support shamir promised to 
support who is a jew legislation under which only orthodox 
rabbis could approve conversions to judaism the action would take 
the form of an amendment to the law of return which gives israeli 
citizenship to any jew who seeks it 
current law defines a jew as a person born of a jewish mother or 
converted to judaism the proposed change would add in accordance 
with halacha jewish religious law and thus nullify conversions 
performed by reform and conservative rabbis who do not strictly 
observe such requirements 
spectre said such an amendment would alienate conservative and 
reform jews who are the vast majority of the 5 million in america 
we are dedicated to preventing the surrender to ultraorthodox 
blackmail he said we dont believe the way to glorify judaism 
is through coercive legislation judaisms ideas can compete on the 
open market of ideas it doesnt need coercion to back it up 
he said his coalition favors reforming israels electoral system 
to limit the power of the minority religious parties 
yehuda bauer head of the israel association for humanistic 
secular judaism said israels largely secular population is 
threatened by the resurgence of orthodox political power about 75 
percent of israels 35 million jews are nonreligious 
bauer said orthodox parties want to create a backward 
khomeinilike society by legislating religious observance 
referring to the iranian revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini

residents of a 20block area evacuated 
because of a devastating cotton fire returned home wednesday to find 
that the fire had destroyed at least 25 homes and four businesses 
after a 30minute tour wednesday morning gov henry bellmon 
compared the situation to a scene out of a horror movie 
i cant imagine anyone thinking up a scenario like this where 
there would be a fire break out in a field of cotton modules when 
the wind is blowing 60 miles per hour bellmon said 
eighteen people were treated for minor injuries 400 residents of 
a poor southside neighborhood were evacuated 
fire came and took everything said jose cresencios briones 
who lost his house and storage shed to the fire that began in a 
storage field tuesday and spread to this city of 23000 in 
southwestern oklahoma 
briones said his property was partially insured but he didnt 
know where he would work or how he would house his wife and five 
children 
police chief jim hughes said the destroyed cotton was probably 
worth about 3 million besides the destroyed homes and businesses 
hughes said about 100 homes were damaged by smoke he said he had no 
estimate of monetary damages 
several teams including civil defense the red cross and city 
workers reviewed damages wednesday as preparation for submitting 
applications for emergency aid said city administrator joe courtney 
the cause of the fire was undetermined courtney said 
residents donated food clothing and furniture to burnedout 
residents officials said by early afternoon 4000 had been 
collected officials said the money would be spent primarily for 
housing 
piles of clothes canned food toys and fresh fruit lined the 
walls of the temporary relief center 
the giant bales or modules were about 40 feet long 8 feet high 
and 8 feet wide said courtney they were stacked in fields awaiting 
processing at a cotton gin 
the winds carried burning bits of newly harvested cotton through 
the city tuesday afternoon 
the flames missed the trailer of bill tackett but razed that of 
his neighbor 15 feet away 
lucky im telling you im lucky tackett said it could 
have been worse because of the smoke the firemen couldnt get 
around to all of the houses 
we couldnt see a hand or foot in front of our face said 
firefighter eddie williamson we had to feel from house to house 
on wednesday police and firefighters conducted a housetohouse 
search of the charred area utility workers repaired telephone lines 
meanwhile firefighters watched the modules which civil defense 
director dwight dennis said tuesday night would probably burn for 
two days 
its not uncommon for a module to selfignite under certain 
situations courtney said it might sit out there and smother 
for two days and we might not even be aware of it

the no 2 official in west 
germanys jewish community resigned wednesday under pressure from 
fellow jewish leaders angered by his defense of a controversial 
speech on the nazi era 
michael fuersts resignation came as west germans continue to 
debate last weeks speech by parliament president philipp jenninger 
who also resigned 
heinz galinski chairman of the national jewish council 
announced after a special meeting of the 18member jewish leadership 
that fuerst had decided to step down because of a longstanding 
lack of agreement between me and himself 
fuerst a lawyer in the city of hanover left the council meeting 
after issuing the resignation a woman who answered the telephone at 
his home more than 155 miles north of frankfurt said he was not 
there no one answered the telephone at fuersts office on 
wednesday a national holiday 
i hope that with this explanation the controversy has been 
resolved galinski said after reading the resignation 
announcement he said the announcement had been prepared with 
fuersts approval 
fuerst had been under fire especially from the west german 
jewish community leaders since his defense of jenningers nov 10 
speech at a memorial service on the 50th anniversary of 
kristallnacht the night of terror against jews across germany that 
signaled the coming holocaust 
jenninger had reminded his audience during the speech that many 
germans initially embraced hitlers campaigns and felt that the jews 
deserved being put back in their place 
about 50 members of the german bundestag walked out in protest of 
jenningers remarks and the 56yearold member of chancellor helmut 
kohls christian democratic party resigned the next day 
jenninger said he had been misunderstood he told nationwide 
television that you cant call everything by its name in germany 
galinski said after the speech he thought silence was the only 
appropriate response to jenningers comments 
fuerst however gave his own assessment hours after the 
controversial address 
i welcome the fact that the parliament president described in 
full clarity what was happening in germany between 1933 and 1938 
especially the fact that everything hitler did was strongly 
supported by the masses of all germans fuerst told a nationally 
televised panel discussion 
fuerst 41 also spoke out at the time against the growing number 
of calls for jenningers resignation he said monday he had received 
many calls from those who approved of his defense of jenninger 
galinski and other council members said fuersts statements 
outraged most of the jewish community 
he had no chance the overwhelming majority was against him it 
was not just us but the whole jewish community council member 
nathan kalmanowicz of munich said after wednesdays meeting 
galinski told the associated press that the council members would 
have taken a vote of noconfidence against fuerst if he hadnt 
stepped down voluntarily 
the jenninger dispute has intensified west germanys debate over 
the haunting legacy of the third reich 
many people like fuerst have cautiously approved of jenningers 
attempt to remind germans that responsibility for the holocaust is 
shouldered by more than the nazi leadership 
the part about the people staying silent giving approval and 
that it could happen among a majority of the germans people say 
that very seldom said parliament member hildegard hammbruecher 
hammbreucher a member of the government coalition partner free 
democrats who started in politics in 1948 also said the speech 
offered sharp corners and edges for further debate on the nazi 
era

israel has secretly conducted a second test of a 
missile with nuclear capability that has the range to strike all the 
arab capitals a military journal reported wednesday 
janes defense weekly quoted unidentified us intelligence 
sources as saying the jerichoii missile was fired into the 
mediterranean in september around the time israel launched an 
experimental satellite into space 
the two launches did not appear related and the firing of the 
jerichoii did not yield any additional information regarding the 
tactical missiles current and future capabilities the magazine 
said 
it said the jerichoii was first testfired in may 1987 and 
splashed down south of the greek island of crete 
the 1987 launch carried the missile 530 miles and it was 
projected to have a maximum range of 940 miles putting it in 
striking range of all the arab capitals janes said 
it said last years launch prompted soviet warnings that since 
the missile could reach the southern soviet union moscow might take 
defensive and political steps but these measures did not 
materialize 
after the soviet protest israeli officials leaked word to the 
media that the missiles could not reach soviet territory janes 
said 
israel has never confirmed persistent foreign intelligence 
assessments that it has nuclear weapons or can assemble them on 
short notice and has given scant information about the jericho 
program

the value of us agricultural exports jumped 
26 percent to a fouryear high of 352 billion in the fiscal year 
that ended on sept 30 the agriculture department said wednesday 
actual quantities of grain and other commodities totaled 1475 
million metric tons up 14 percent from 1292 million tons shipped 
in 198687 when the value was 279 billion 
the new figures were up from the previous forecast issued on aug 
25 when the value was projected at 34 billion and the volume at 
146 million tons 
despite the sharp gains the years totals were still far below 
the record levels of 438 billion and 1623 million tons in 198081 
before high interest rates foreign competition and other economic 
factors triggered annual declines 
deputy secretary peter c myers credited the 1985 farm laws 
lower price support mechanisms with making us commodities more 
competitive in world trade 
myers said a decline in food prices last month proves that 
export increases did not occur at the expense of us consumers 
despite this summers damaging drought 
the usda says higher commodity prices point to another increase 
in the value of exports in the fiscal year that began on oct 1 but 
that the actual volume may decline 
a forecast of 1989 farm exports is scheduled for release on nov 
29 
wheat accounted for twothirds of the volume increase last fiscal 
year and significant increases were reported for corn 
livestock feed and fodder and vegetable oils 
overall exports of grains and feeds accounted for more than 
127 billion of the total up 37 percent 
other categories included oilseeds and products 77 billion 
up 19 percent livestock products 49 billion up 24 percent 
horticultural products 38 billion up 21 percent cotton 215

officials from five scandinavian 
nations wednesday adopted a program to drastically reduce the 
poisonous emissions environmentalists say are choking the northern 
seas 
but the greenpeace conservationist group charged that the plan 
which calls for a 50 percent cut in the emission of pollutants into 
the baltic and north seas by 1995 does not go far enough 
environment ministers and parliament members from norway sweden 
finland iceland and denmark adopted the antipollution plan at an 
extraordinary session of the nordic council an advisory body to the 
five governments 
the program also calls for reducing air pollution and oil 
pollution from offshore platforms and improving environmental 
protection 
the special session of the nordic council was called following 
alarming signs of deterioration in the marine environment in 
northern waters last summer 
fishermen some of whom serenaded the 87 participants at the 
meeting with horns claim the worsening pollution is killing marine 
life and putting them out of business 
in the summer giant blooms of yellow algae killed hundreds of 
tons of fish along the coasts of norway and sweden in addition 
thousands of seals died from a viral epidemic whose origin was a 
mystery vast tracts of the seabed in the kattegat strait shared by 
norway sweden and denmark were found to be devoid of sea life due 
to lack of oxygen 
the pollution is caused mainly by metals from industrial wastes 
phosphorus from inadequate sewage treatment and nitrogen from 
fertilizers and chemicals used in agriculture 
there is reason to believe that in the kattegat permanent 
damage has been done said danish fisheries minister lars 
gammelgaard 
gammelgaard said fish stocks in the strait had been reduced by 
half between 1980 and 1987 and that many species had become extinct 
you can see from one day to the next that there are greater and 
greater pressures on marine fauna and we have reached a limit where 
nature cannot deal with this pressure on its own said swedish 
member of parliament karin soeder 
the nordic council program was the first major action by all five 
nordic countries to rescue the marine environment 
the environement ministers were instructed to draw up proposals 
for reducing the emissions and to present them in february the 
measures will be reviewed at the next session of the nordic council 
in 1990 
but greenpeace was not satisfied with the new plan saying in a 
statement 
fishermen and environmentalist have every reason to be angry 
and disappointed about the result of the meeting and not least 
the suffocating political wrangle behind the scenes 
critics of the plan presented the 87 participants at the nordic 
council session with five barrels of smelly ooze from the bottom of 
the oeresund strait

the leader of irans main opposition group 
said wednesday that 12 clergymen have been executed in tehran on 
orders from ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
masoud rajavi leader of the iraqibased mujahedeen khalq or 
peoples holy warriors said the executions occurred last week and 
indicated an intensification of the regimes internal conflicts 
as it heads for disintegration and inevitable collapse 
rajavis claims could not be independently confirmed 
the statement sent to the associated press in nicosia from the 
mujahedeens headquarters in baghdad followed a un report nov 3 
that large numbers of prisoners members of opposition groups 
have been executed in iran since july 
dissident iranian factions say more than 1100 people including 
mujahedeen activists have been executed since the movements 
military wing the national liberation army of iran captured two 
towns in a july offensive 
the following month iran and iraq agreed to a ceasefire in 
their eightyear war 
khomeinis acceptance of the ussponsored ceasefire is 
understood to have been opposed by hardliners in the fundamentalist 
tehran hierarchy rajavi claimed it has internal divisions in tehran 
between various factions jockeying for power after khomeini dies 
the 88yearold revolutionary patriarch has been reported to be 
ailing 
despite statements by iranian leaders that the hierarchy is 
united rajavi said the executions showed that khomeini has found 
no other resort but killing and intimidation 
he said khomeini and parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani the 
most powerful figure after the ayatollah want to make it 
abundantly clear to the other mullahs that the consequence of 
nonconformity or dissent even within the regime is death 
the statement identified only three of the executed clerics it 
gave their names as omid najafababi hussein arab and sultani and 
said they were executed on khomeinis personal order 
other iranian dissident sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the executed clerics were associates of ayatollah 
hussein ali montazeri khomeinis designated successor they said 
they had no details about why the clerics were reportedly executed 
montazeri and rafsanjani have been at odds in the past although 
recent indications were that they had set aside their differences 
while iran sought to rebuild its military machine and carry out 
postwar reconstruction 
montazeri whose succession to khomeini has been opposed by other 
iranian leaders was tainted in 1986 by the arrest of mehdi hashemi 
brother of montazeris soninlaw and a former close associate 
his arrest was ordered by rafsanjani after hashemi exposed 
rafsanjanis clandestine contacts with the united states in the 
secret deal to trade arms for hostages held in lebanon 
hashemi a hardline cleric who was believed linked to iranian 
terrorist operations abroad was convicted of treason and murder and 
executed last year 
that was seen as a coup for rafsanjani and a demonstration of his 
ascendancy in tehran

sudanese rebels and political 
leaders met wednesday to finish drafting an agreement to end a 
5yearold civil war in southern sudan 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation front and the democratic 
unionist party were attending the conference in addis ababa 
ethiopias capital 
col john garang a rebel leader and mohammed osman mirghani 
the party general secretary were first scheduled to sign a peace 
agreement monday however the signing was postponed to tuesday and 
then to wednesday there was no explanation 
the democratic unionist party is the secondlargest political 
party in sudan and is a partner with prime minister sadiq mahdis 
umma party in the khartoum government 
the fivepoint peace agreement calls for suspension of islamic 
law and the state of emergency in sudan it also calls for ending 
defense pacts between sudan and other countries and for convening a 
constitutional conference attended by all political parties 
in addition garang agreed to allow relief to reach starving war 
refugees in sudan 
mansour khaled a former foreign minister in the government of 
ousted president gaafar nimeiri and now a rebel supporter described 
the addis ababa meeting as a final and formal conference 
khaled said mahdi would accept an agreement between the rebels 
and the minority party because his majority umma party is committed 
to the socalled koka dam declaration 
sudanese political parties including rebel leaders agreed to a 
united and secular sudan at a 1986 meeting in koka a resort town 60 
miles south of addis ababa 
mahdi has given his blessings to the meeting and on nov 10 said 
he had given mirghani ideas to present to garang he did not 
elaborate 
garang organized the sudan peoples liberation army in early 1983 
and began his fight for southern autonomy and political economic 
and administrative reforms thenpresident nimeiris proclamation of 
islamic law exacerbated the war six months later 
the rebels claim to control 95 percent of the southern 
countryside and small towns 
relief workers say the accumulated effects of more than five 
years of war have brought widespread famine to much of southern 
sudan this year they estimate that starvation has killed more than 
250000 people 
onethird of southern sudans civilian population of 6 million 
has fled in search of a haven in northern sudan and neighboring 
ethiopia

thursday night on cbs it will suddenly become 
midday on a friday nov 22 1963 the blackandwhite soap opera 
as the world turns will be on 
the soap opera is interrupted by walter cronkite intoning here 
is a bulletin from cbs news 
the rarely scene footage is in the cbs documentary four days 
in november the assassination of john f kennedy marking the 
25th anniversary of the death of the president 
the documentary consists of little more than edited footage from 
the 56 hours that cbs was on the air covering the assassination the 
shooting of lee harvey oswald and the kennedy funeral 
the vintage film has an eloquence of its own that cbs anchor dan 
rather and executive producer perry wolff wisely leave alone the 
documentary allows viewers their own memories with a minimum of 
presentday intrusion 
we opened a time capsule thats all we did said wolff who 
joined rather and the other producers of the program at a screening 
for tv critics 
for once at least we didnt do too much said rather who 
only appears on camera to set up the next sequence 
our purpose is not to make commentary on the past but to bring 
it back 
keeping presentday commentary to a minimum apparently also 
allowed the network to avoid another rathercronkite wrangle rather 
gets the spotlight as anchor of the broadcast but cronkite is the 
star of the archival footage 
cronkite declined to comment on his lack of participation in the 
documentary calling it a judgment call 
the only footage in the documentary that was not part of cbs 
coverage at the time is the famous zapruder 8mm film of the 
assassination cbs did not have rights to the film in 1963 now 
however the film is rented out by abraham zapruders family 
after the initial bulletin cbs returned briefly to regular 
programming a commercial for nescafe then reinterrupted 
cronkite appeared on camera in the newsroom there were live 
pictures from the dallas trade mart the site of a luncheon that was 
to have been the next stop on kennedys agenda 
eddie barker of krld cbs local affiliate reported from the 
trade mart passing along unconfirmed reports that kennedy was dead 
an unheralded cameraman zeroed in on a weeping black waiter later 
on workers sadly removing the presidential seal from the podium 
rather later confirmed the report of kennedys death working the 
story from the station by phone barker had gotten confirmation from 
a doctor on the parkland hospital staff rather confirmed with a 
priest and a doctor who were in the emergency room when the 
president died cronkite reported rathers confirmation but the 
official announcement did not come for another 17 minutes 
it was a very long 17 minutes rather recalled 
cronkite is handed a piece of wire copy from dallas texas 
the flash apparently official he said solemnly president 
kennedy died at 1 pm central standard time two oclock eastern 
standard time he takes off his glasses and looks at the clock 
some 38 minutes ago cronkites voice cracks and he has to take 
a moment to collect himself before continuing 
in the documentary rather explains that viewers may see water 
marks on some of the footage television had never covered such an 
event and because most news cameras used film instead of videotape 
technicians were developing film as fast as they could and putting 
it on the air still wet 
also included is rarely seen footage of accussed assassin oswald 
answering reporters questions as police escort him through the 
police station theres also the nowfamous footage of jack ruby 
stepping out of a crowd and shooting oswald to death at pointblank 
range 
the last part of the documentary is the state funeral it was 
television news coverage at its best as announcers let the tragic 
spectacle unfold with very little comment 
according to wolff viewers are lucky to see the cbs footage at 
all he said the film was deteriorating and probably would not have 
lasted another five years 
even if the broadcast doesnt work its been preserved for one 
more generation wolff said this time capsule is a national 
treasure

the internal revenue service served formal 
notice wednesday that noncharitable taxexempt organizations are 
required to fully disclose to potential donors that their 
contributions are not taxdeductible 
the agency also issued detailed guidelines to organizations that 
offer to sell routine services that are available free or for a 
nominal charge from the federal government this requirement was 
prompted by advertisements offering to sell workers a summary of 
their earned social security benefits even though that information 
is available free from the social security administration 
the guidelines require such solicitations to state expressly if 
the information can be obtained from the government for 250 or 
less 
the restriction applies only if the information to be provided 
affects only the specific individual solicited it exempts for 
example solicitations to provide copies of federal agency 
newsletters or material on pending legislation 
the restriction and the requirement that noncharitable 
organizations fully disclose that donations are not deductible as 
charitable contributions were required by congress in a 1987 law 
the latter provision affects such groups as political farm and 
labor organizations whose annual gross receipts normally exceed 
100000 
any advertisement or other solicitation must include a statement 
similar to contributions or gifts to name of organization are 
not tax deductible 
if the solicitation is in a television ad for example the 
statement must appear in close proximity to the request for 
contributions if oral or if written must appear on the screen 
in large easily readable type for at least five seconds

congress should resist demands by socalled 
notch babies to raise social security benefits for people born 
between 1917 and 1921 concludes a report released wednesday by the 
national academy of social insurance 
the report by a panel of nonpartisan experts said benefits to 
some people born before 1917 are higher than congress intended 
sometimes as much as 200 a month more than people with similar work 
histories born a few days later 
but the experts said it is not feasible politically or 
economically to reduce their benefits or raise those of everyone 
born later therefore the panel recommends no change in present 
law the report concludes 
the notch report was sought last march by sens daniel patrick 
moynihan and bob dole chairman and senior gop member of the senate 
finance committees social security subcommittee 
the notch or discrepancy in benefits arose when congress 
adopted a new formula meant to keep rising social security benefits 
at a constant percentage of a persons average preretirement 
earnings 
however people born before 1917 were allowed to use the old 
overgenerous method of calculation the result a benefit rate that 
peaked in 1981 at 56 percent of average earnings about 15 
percentage points higher than what congress had intended 
robert myers chairman of the study panel and formerly executive 
director of the national commission on social security reform said 
there are probably about 1 million notch babies feeling 
substantial impact from the situation 
it isnt fair myers acknowledged but he and others on the 
study panel said those born after 1917 are receiving the benefits 
congress intended 
the report said any inequity is due to some people getting too 
much not others getting too little it would be unwise to extend 
this overgenerous treatment to additional persons the report 
said furthermore it said there is no practical way to correct the 
problem 
eliminating the notch would require reducing benefits for those 
already receiving them the report said conversely increasing 
the benefits of those born in the notch years would in turn create 
new relative notches affecting those born in later years 
myers said it would cost up to 300 billion to equalize 
everyones benefits as far as reducing the windfall he said it 
would be very difficult and expensive to find the individuals who 
received it not to mention that from a practical standpoint 
congress would be quite loath to take away benefits from people 
already receiving them 
myers said there are many misconceptions about the notch 
situation and criticized some grassroots notch groups for 
disseminating erroneous information 
the report says for example that some notch babies incorrectly 
believe they are at a disadvantage compared to people born both 
before and after them computation procedures are if anything 
generally to the advantage of those born prior to 1922 when benefits 
relative to prior earnings are considered it said 
the national academy of social insurance describes itself as a 
nonpartisan nonprofit center for research and education on social 
security and related programs its board of advisers includes 
moynihan and sen john heinz rpa aflcio president lane kirkland 
and alexander trowbridge president of the national association of 
manufacturers

days early wednesday with balloons a fourtiered cake and a jazz 
band party where his tailless friends disclosed hes a contented 
bachelor and a closet republican 
i think hes been a republican said roy disney who ought to 
know 
no sooner had walt disneys nephew uttered the rword than 
michael eisner board chairman of disneys 3 billion corporate 
empire grabbed the microphone and said no hes nonpartisan 
but the elephant was out of the bag and mickey didnt deny it 
fat sleek and eternally grinning he merely bowed and waved a 
whitegloved hand at his adoring fans at the smithsonian 
institutions national museum of american history 
it was 60 years ago friday on nov 18 1928 at the colony 
theater in new york city that mickey made his film debut in 
steamboat willie the first synchronized sound cartoon in black 
and white

mickey captivated the public because hes just a nice little 
guy noted roy disney a former disney filmmaker who is corporate

the discoverers of the sunken titanic 
announced a venture wednesday designed to bring undersea exploration 
of a roman shipwreck to thousands of students across the country via 
live television 
robert ballard who led the team that found the titanic in 1985 
said students linked by satellite to at least nine science museums 
in the united states and canada will be able to communicate with 
explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the 
mediterranean sea floor 
while the 6 million privately funded project involves several 
advances in technology ballard said its main purpose is to excite 
students about science 
we really have a crisis of education in the united states 
ballard said at a news conference at the woods hole oceanographic 
institution in recent years he said science has failed to provide 
young impressionable students with attractive role models 
instead he said the role models are that scientists are 
nerds or as my kids would say dweebs and dweebs sit at terminals 
and are dropouts from society 
in the jason project named after the underwater robot that 
helped explore the titanic highquality television cable will be 
connected to a ship thousands of feet above on the sea surface for 
14 days next may the ship and its 50member crew including six 
high school students will control the movements of the robot and 
send back satellite images from two underwater locations 
in addition the national georgraphic society plans to produce 
and broadcast a later special on the expedition 
the live broadcasts will be transmitted via the turner 
broadcasting system in atlanta and electronic data systems corp in 
atlanta to the nine science museums in boston chicago memphis 
washington dc dallas philadelphia rochester ny charlotte 
nc and victoria british columbia the shipboard crew will 
broadcast six programs a day or 84 40minute programs in all that 
will be seen by a total of roughly 200000 students 
instead of simply sitting and watching the programs the students 
will have before them a multiscreen control room that replicates the 
control center on the ship students will be able to ask questions 
of the crew and in some cases take over the controls of jason 
ballard said 
ballard called the concept telepresence 
the plan is for jason to explore an undersea volcano field off 
the west coast of italy where minor eruptions emissions of molten 
minerals and an abundance of wildlife will be visible at another 
western mediterranean site which ballard declined to disclose 
jason will send back pictures of a vast debris field believed to be 
the remains of several roman shipwrecks from the second century ad 
frank ireton of the national science teachers association which 
is helping train science teachers who will bring their classes to 
the programs said its a tremendous interestgenerator if we 
have 200000 students and we interest 10 percent of them in science 
my gosh thats a tremendous benefit

compared to before his energy has somewhat declined on

on wednesday afternoon the emperor had a fever of 1004 degrees 
up from 988 in the morning his normal temperature is about 959

did not plan to give him further blood transfusions hirohito has 
received 42 pints of blood more than three times the amount 
circulating in his body 
on wednesday the emperor received visits from the families of 
his two sons crown prince akihito and prince hitachi but they

dozens of palestinian americans and arab 
diplomats on wednesday celebrated the declaration of a palestinian 
state with balloons a birthday cake and wild cheering 
under a banner reading happy birthday palestine speakers 
extolled this weeks decision by the palestine national council to 
declare an independent palestinian state in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
the pnc which is the legislative branch of the palestine 
liberation organization also adopted a resolution which implicitly 
accepts israels right to exist renounces terrorism and calls for 
middle east peace talks under international auspices 
saudi ambassador prince bandar binsultan said the pnc program 
is a major breakthrough toward peace its a great opportunity 
for the united states 
also present at the celebration were the ambassadors of jordan 
egypt qatar morocco yemen as well as diplomats from kuwait 
djibouti somalia and india so far 23 countries have recognized 
the declaration 
the united states has rejected the declaration of a palestinian 
state calling it a unilateral action that does not advance the 
cause of peace 
the state department has also said the pnc program does not meet 
the us requirements for dialogue with the plo because it fails to 
explicitly recognize israel 
the declaration of a state does not have any practical effect in 
the near term but it has served to boost morale among palestinians 
in the occupied territories who have been staging an insurrection 
against the 20year israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
wednesdays event organized by the american arab 
antidiscrimination committee began with a moment of silence for 
the 300 palestinians killed in clashes with israeli troops over the 
past 11 months adc advocates civil rights for americans of arab 
descent 
participants then sang the palestinian anthem which speaks about 
a return to the homeland followed by the popular beatles refrain 
give peace a chance 
a birthday cake was then wheeled out to the sound of wild 
cheering and yululating 
abdeen jabara president of the adc said the pnc decision 
should be the electric shock to break the cycle of violence and 
pain for palestinians the american administration must seize 
this window of opportunity he added

saying it isnt over until the tall thin 
guy sings gov john sununu on wednesday would not confirm that 
presidentelect george bush has picked him to be white house chief 
of staff 
but given several opportunities during a statehouse news 
conference sununu did not deny the report either 
until the vice president decides yes or no and he certainly 
could decide no in the interim i dont really think its 
appropriate for me to comment sununu said when asked if he has 
accepted the chief of staff job 
it isnt over until the tall thin guy sings he said of the 
lanky vice president 
but sources close to bush who insisted on anonymity said bush 
definitely has chosen sununu as chief of staff 
sununu is seen as a major political creditor of bushs he helped 
the vice president rebound from defeat in the iowa caucuses last 
february with a critical win in new hampshires leadoff primary 
sununu 49 subsequently decided not to seek a record fourth term 
as governor and was one of bushs national cochairmen for the 
general election campaign traveling widely and appearing on 
television programs to attack the democratic nominee michael 
dukakis governor of neighboring massachusetts 
sununu dined privately with bush in florida on monday evening and 
accompanied the vice president back to washington aboard air force 
two on tuesday before returning to new hampshire on wednesday 
sununu conducted routine state business 
he also held a news conference at which he confirmed that he 
discussed that job in particular the chief of staff post 
with bush on monday evening 
we discussed what i might be involved in doing in general 
sununu said it included a lot of positions in terms of general 
interests both his interests and my interests and im going to 
leave it at that 
youve heard me say i wouldnt go to washington just to go to 
washington i do think that chief of staff with a great president

the arizona board of pharmacy asked the rj 
reynolds tobacco co to voluntarily withdraw its testmarketed 
smokeless cigarettes pending a determination of whether it is a 
drug but the company refused 
the board did not determine whether the premier cigarette is a 
drug delivery system as critics contend or a nonburning 
cigarette as the company argues 
nor did it act on a request by the american medical association 
to halt sales of premier cigarettes in arizona a similar request 
has been made of state officials in missouri where premier also is 
being testmarketed 
rj reynolds in a statement from its headquarters in 
winstonsalem nc declined to withdraw premier from the market 
acceptance of premier rests with the smokers and we believe 
they should be the final judges of the cigarette the company said 
the arizona board also approved a motion to ask all interested 
parties to submit pertinent information dealing with the tobacco 
product for possible discussion at its scheduled jan 17 meeting 
but board members said a hearing on the issue would be unlikely then 
the board voted 70 on member michael w noels motion to seek 
voluntary withdrawal after assistant attorney general timothy j 
agan declined to give the board legal advice in the public session 
due to the possibility of litigation 
noels motion said the board has been unable to determine if 
premier is a drug or device over which it has authority to regulate 
distribution and sale 
he said the board was soliciting information that will lead 
ultimately to such a decision but that the process will take 
several months to complete 
the motion requested the voluntary withdrawal due to the 
potential hazard to the health and safety of the citizens of 
arizona 
jack lasota a former state attorney general representing 
reynolds had urged the board to take no action on an ama petition 
filed with the board 
the ama asked the federal food and drug administration in april 
to take jurisdiction over the product as a drug but the fda has 
been studying the issue and has yet to make a determination 
reynolds began testmarketing the product oct 1 in parts of 
arizona and missouri the ama on nov 2 asked the arizona board and 
the missouri department of health to bar sales 
lasota said a decision is expected from the fda by the end of the 
year a scant six weeks away and said the board should not act 
before the fda does

savings and loan industry capital increased for 
the second consecutive month in september as the government by 
closing and rescuing failed institutions began transferring the 
industrys losses to its own books the government said wednesday 
the federal home loan bank board said capital representing the 
difference between loans and other assets and deposits and other 
liabilities increased 24 billion in september following a 61 
billion increase in august in the first seven months of the year 
the industry lost 61 billion in capital 
capital declines are often a good indicator of losses but the 
bank board began increasing the pace of sampl rescues in midaugust 
rescues in effect wipe out the red ink of the failed institutions 
transferring it to the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
which insures deposits up to 100000 
the industry lost 75 billion in the first six months of this 
year and bank board economist james barth has estimated third 
quarter losses at about 2 billion 
not suprisingly the use of financial assistance to protect 
insured depositors exerts a positive effect on the overall financial 
condition of the thrift industry barth said in a statement 
the agency has dealt with more than 140 troubled institutions so 
far this year 
meanwhile deposits flowed out of the nations 3028 sampls for the 
fifth consecutive month the drain followed seven months of gains as 
investors sought a safe haven for their money after the october 1987 
stock market crash 
net withdrawals totaled 18 billion in september down from 30 
billion in august for the first nine months of the year sampls had 
net new deposits of 67 billion compared with net withdrawals of 
137 billion during the same period of 1987 
thrift institutions mortgage lending business continued to 
suffer with the decline in housing sales and construction mortgage 
loans closed totaled 232 billion down 56 percent from august and 
down 126 percent from a year ago 
for the first nine months of 1988 mortgage lending was off by

the state department said wednesday the policy 
declaration by the palestine liberation organizations parliament in 
exile falls short of us conditions for opening a dialogue with the 
plo 
spokesman charles redman suggested that the declaration moved the 
plo somewhat closer to us requirements but he said no dialogue is 
contemplated because of ambiguities and other shortcomings in the 
statement 
plo chairman yasser arafat had said tuesday in algiers that he 
hoped the declaration would serve as the basis for a revived us 
effort to pursue a middle east peace settlement 
we feel that the ball is now in the american court arafat 
said after the palestinian national council approved the declaration 
which among other provisions accepts un security council 
resolutions as the basis for a middle east settlement 
the two resolutions imply recognition of israels right to exist 
but redman said the pnc statement was insufficient because it was 
ambiguous both in its meaning and placement in the text 
recognition must be clear and unambiguous redman said 
he said plo repudiation of terrorist activities against civilian 
targets was a restatement of the previous position it is still 
performance that counts redman said 
the us position on dealing with the plo is that no dialogue can 
take place until the plo accepts un resolutions 242 and 338 
recognizes israels right to exist and renounces terrorism 
the policy has been maintained since the ford administration 
the two resolutions call on israel to withdraw from territories 
occupied during the 1967 arabisraeli war and assert the right of 
all countries in the region to live within secure borders 
arafat refused to say explicitly tuesday whether acceptance of 
resolution 242 meant recognition of israel 
the reagan administrations assessment of the declaration 
reflects only a shortterm us position because it has only nine 
weeks left in office 
alluding to the impending leadership change in washington before 
the pnc meeting convened in algiers arafat called on 
presidentelect george bush to pressure israel into making 
concessions 
bush was noncommittal on the pnc declaration when asked about it 
tuesday at a news conference 
if indeed there is specific recognition of security council 
resolution 242 that would be a very important step forward bush 
said 
he added that he wanted to be sure such recognition was contained 
in the statement before commenting further 
if the plo does recognize the resolution without qualifications 
it would be something that we have been encouraging for a long 
long time and so you would view that with optimism bush said 
despite an overall negative assessment redman said there were 
some encouraging signs coming out of the pnc meeting 
he said there were indications that some palestinians are 
trying to move the plo in a constructive way thats encouraging and 
should continue 
meanwhile wednesday mayor teddy kollek of jerusalem met with 
president reagan and said plo leaders had not advanced prospects for 
middle east peace 
they didnt denounce terrorism they didnt accept the 
existence of israel they couched it altogether with all the 
resolutions at the un which were denying israel kollek told 
reporters there was nothing to it there is no step forward on 
their part which would enable us to negotiate 
israeli embassy spokesman yossi gal said kollek who is in the 
united states on a fundraising drive for various projects met with 
reagan in the oval office for 10 minutes 
gal said reagan thanked kollek for the free access being granted 
the faithful of all religions to the holy sites of jerusalem 
kollek said he invited reagan to visit jerusalem the embassy 
spokesman said the president thanked him saying he hadnt yet made 
future plans 
reagan encouraged kollek to continue his endeavors at promoting 
tolerance in the volatile city he has governed for 23 years gal 
said 
kollek gave reagan a 1550 map that shows jerusalem at the center 
of the world what would become the united states a tiny blob on the 
side and the soviet union not at all 
every mayor believes his city is the center of the world but i 
have it documented kollek said he told the president

a military court investigating the 
killing of 14 fishermen by venezuelan soldiers had two survivors 
arrested wednesday on charges of military rebellion an 
opposition leader said 
wolmer gregorio pinilla and jose augusto arias were handed over 
to military police in the presence of opposition politicians walter 
marquez of the leftist socialist movement party said from his 
offices in san cristobal 
el diario a caracas daily reported wednesday that the court at 
san cristobal in tachira state 330 miles southwest of caracas 
exonerated the soldiers involved in the killings on grounds of 
selfdefense 
it said the court did not state whether the 14 dead men were 
guerrillas as military spokesmen said after the shooting occurred 
oct 29 or a party of fishermen the survivors say it was a fishing 
party and they escaped by jumping into the water from a dugout canoe 
when soldiers opened fire 
the shooting inspired student riots early this month in which at 
least 60 people were wounded 
marquez said his party would urge the supreme court to pursue the 
case 
townspeople of el amparo 350 miles southwest of caracas near the 
colombian border protected the two survivors when military 
authorities tried to take them away after the incident the men said 
they feared for their lives especially since the military 
originally reported 16 killed in the encounter 
opposition leaders say the judge in the case reports directly to 
the head of the jose antonio paez brigade which carried out the 
killing marquez said this decision is a complete violation of 
justice 
he gave the survivors his protection after the shooting and told 
their story to the press 
on wednesday marquez said the military court has refused to 
carry out even the most elementary investigations such as exhuming 
the bodies to determine whether or not the dead men had fired any 
weapons before they were killed 
he claimed the military planted weapons on the dead men dressed 
the bodies in uniforms of the colombian national liberation army a 
guerrilla group and poured acid on the faces to prevent 
identification 
soon after the attack on the men the government called it the 
result of a confusion 
in its arrest order the military court said the 14 dead were 
coauthors with the two survivors of military rebellion and 
declared the investigation ended because the dead men could not 
testify marquez said 
military rebellion is a general term often used to justify 
detention without cause amnesty international said in a report on 
venezuela published in october

a farmer has been accused of cruelty to 
animals for allegedly allowing 20000 chickens to die of 
malnutrition and dehydration 
timothy panteleakos 32 of canterbury was arrested on the 
cruelty charge tuesday by a connecticut humane society officer he 
was released on a written promise to appear nov 28 in superior 
court 
only fires and natural disasters have caused greater poultry 
losses in the state said william harrington chief of the 
connecticut department of agricultures livestock division 
state officials discovered the chickens on oct 31 after they 
were notified that tens of thousands of chickens were dead or near 
death at panteleakos farm said laurie greene the state 
veterinarian 
about 8700 chickens were living when officials arrived at the 
20acre farm greene said with the farms feeding machine in 
disrepair officials fed the chickens by hand throughout the night 
using two tons of grain trucked in by the state 
the health of the malnourished chickens improved after a week 
during which they were fed with a total of seven tons of 
statepurchased grain 
a new jerseybased chicken rendering company agreed to pick up 
the remaining live chickens at no cost 
greene said the agriculture department and the state department 
of environmental protection had cited the farm repeatedly during the 
past year on health code and other violations 
on sept 30 a state hearing officer recommended that the farm be 
shut down but panteleakos appealed the decision to agriculture 
commissioner kenneth b andersen the commissioner rejected the 
appeal 
panteleakos who operated the farm for about a year and who had 
previous poultry farming experience said the state shares the blame 
for the loss 
panteleakos contended that the state ignored his requests for 
assistance and that health conditions were no worse or better 
than other chicken farms 
this was a farmer in dire need he said i needed financial 
help i feel im the victim here 
greene disputed panteleakos explanation she said he never 
sought help voluntarily and that local state and federal agencies 
would have offered assistance 
the 20000 dead chickens which officials said died during a 
twoweek period in late october were buried in the killingly dump 
the cost of the grain and disposal of the dead chickens was about 
3000 greene said adding the state probably will seek restitution 
cruelty to animals is a misdemeanor punishable by a 75 fine or a 
year in jail or both said don dupont a humane society police 
officer

a watchdog commission founded by the nestle 
company said wednesday it has found no evidence to support 
allegations the international food products giant is violating an 
agreement against dumping infant formula in third world 
countries 
however former secretary of state edmund muskie head of the 
11member commission acknowledged that the panel had not examined 
specific allegations because no specific complaints were filed by an 
organization that called last month for a resumption of a boycott of 
nestle products 
the system has broken down to the extent complaints are no 
longer submitted to us muskie said at a news conference 
a minneapolisbased group called action for corporate 
accountability called for a resumption of the sevenyear boycott 
ended in 1984 on grounds nestle was failing to live up to the 
spirit of a world health organizationsanctioned agreement on infant 
formula marketing that prompted an end to the earlier boycott 
muskie acknowledged that his panel could only examine whether 
nestle was following the letter of the agreement since it had no 
specific allegations of violations to investigate 
all we have to rely on is a generalized accusation said 
muskie 
action for corporate accountability charged oct 4 that nestle is 
dumping infant formula in third world countries that is supplying 
large quantities of free formula to mothers of newborn infants in an 
effort to get the mothers and babies hooked on bottle feeding 
rather than breast feeding 
muskie said the commission does not agree with that assessment 
and noted that the who agreement does not ban the supply of 
reasonable amounts of free formula to meet the needs of poor mothers 
who need the product and cant afford it 
it is nestles standard practice to require that responsible 
staff at each health institution complete a detailed request form 
before supplies are delivered muskie said in an effort to make 
sure that the quantities required are appropriate nestle also 
audits the amount of supplies it donates in some instances nestle 
has reduced the amount of formula that it provides 
under questioning muskie acknowledged that action for corporate 
accountability and other nestle critics apparently have lost 
confidence in the panels credibility since they no longer file 
complaints with the committee as they did prior to the 1986 who 
agreement 
they have accepted our credibility at least until now he 
said later he added we consider that we are in a position to 
try to be helpful and said were hoping that out of this 
difference of opinion we can shape a new relationship

shops and offices and brought public transportation to a stop in the 
southern province one of the eight provinces of sri lanka

lankas minority tamils to drive the majority sinhalese from the 
northeast where the rebels have waged a fiveyear campaign for an 
independent homeland 
the tamils who represent 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people claim they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who 
form 75 percent of the population and control the military and the 
government 
the governments peace overtures to the tamils have sparked a 
backlash among extremist sinhalese who claim too many concessions 
have been offered to the minority community 
the southern province which has a majority sinhalese population 
is the center of the antigovernment sentiment 
on tuesday sinhalese radicals shot and killed at least seven 
fellow sinhalese the military officials said 
four of the victims died in elpitiya about 50 miles south of 
colombo and the other three were bus drivers killed on the job the 
officials said 
the peoples liberation front a radical sinhalese group called 
strikes throughout the country two weeks ago in an attempt to force 
president junius r jayewardene to dissolve parliament and resign 
they have accused jayewardene who is sinhalese of selling out 
the interests of this island nations majority ethnic group to 
pacify the tamils 
the extremists have rejected a july 1987 peace accord that 
offered the tamils limited autonomy if they surrendered their arms 
they have vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord and are 
blamed for the deaths of more than 550 people mostly sinhalese 
government officials and their supporters 
the tamils also rejected the accord and are fighting government 
troops and indian peacekeeping forces sent to sri lanka last year 
to combat the spiraling violence in the south jayewardene issued 
emergency decrees that allow the army to open fire on 
antigovernment demonstrators and to arrest anyone instigating 
strikes people convicted of starting strikes are subject to death

former presidential aide oliver l north is 
seeking to scuttle the criminal charges against him by trying to 
disclose national secrets irrelevant to his defense irancontra 
prosecutors charged wednesday 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh sought a court order 
barring north from revealing any government secrets in his defense 
of charges he conspired to illegally divert usiran armssale 
proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
walsh contended in court papers that the former presidential aide 
had flouted court orders by not presenting a goodfaith listing of 
the classified documents that he reasonably deems necessary to 
defend against the indictment 
walsh charged that norths grossly overblown list of secret 
government documents he wants to use as trial exhibits includes 
items that are simple efforts at graymail and have no conceivable 
bearing on the charges in the indictment 
norths list of 40000 pages of topsecret documents 
demonstrates once again his expectation that intransigence will 
encumber the processes of law threaten some of our nations most 
valuable secrets and provoke a dismissal of the case walsh said 
the prosecution asked us district judge gerhard a gesell to 
invoke a provision of the classified information procedures act 
cipa barring north from disclosing any classified government 
information 
north arrogantly disregarded the courts repeated orders 
defining his obligations under cipa walsh said given norths 
persistent efforts on all fronts to delay the trial of this case and 
his repeated flouting of cipa and the courts orders fairness and 
respect for the courts procedures require an order exercising the 
courts preclusion powers 
norths attorneys who customarily do not comment on the case 
did not return a reporters telephone call 
under the secrecy law proposed defense exhibits would be 
reviewed in secret court hearings to determine if the material can 
be presented in public form 
walsh contended that north has been determined to force a 
failure of cipas procedures by filing a bloated notice that is 
calculated to overwhelm the courts and the governments abilities 
to conduct those proceedings 
whereas a fair and measured notice consistent with the orders 
of the court might properly have tested cipa the present notice is 
so grossly overblown that it invites dismissal for lack of good 
faith he said in response to the list north filed monday under 
court seal 
north lists documents which are far afield from any logical 
defense including large swatches of cia cables concerning 
nicaragua that bear only the most tangential relation to the subject 
matter in the case walsh said 
he accused north of trying to force the justice department to 
drop the charges based purely on fear that the price in terms of 
the threat to national security is too high to proceed with the 
case under cipa the justice department not walsh would make such 
a decision 
last summer gesell rejected as wholly insufficient the first 
notices that north filed on aug 1 later saying that they 
blatantly lacked any attempt at particularization the judge 
gave north until nov 14 to file notices that met the requirements 
he set 
the court generously gave north and his attorneys three 
additional months on top of the initial document review period 
they had already enjoyed up to that point to determine which 
classified documents would be necessary to defend against each of 
the criminal charges walsh said 
it would be inappropriate futile and unfair for the court 
now as the case moves through final pretrial proceedings to offer 
defendant still more time to try again the prosecution said 
the former national security council aide and retired marine 
lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiring with former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim 
and retired air force maj gen richard v secord to defraud the 
government by diverting armssale profits to the contras 
no date has been set for the trial of north the first of four 
separate proceedings ordered by gesell

the national conference of catholic bishops on 
wednesday rejected a draft vatican document that questioned the 
authority of conferences such as theirs 
first however the bishops greatly softened the tone of their 
reply removing the confrontational language of an earlier version 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago said of the vatican draft 
we think the document is so flawed that the holy see should start 
over his fellow bishops agreed to send essentially that message 
to rome by a 20559 vote that was barely above the necessary 
twothirds of the conferences 305 active members 
the vatican has asked all national bishops conferences to respond 
to its draft document on the role of such bodies in the church and 
no final version is expected for months or even years 
american bishops on both sides of the issue decried any 
suggestion that the issue amounted to a significant dispute between 
the vatican and themselves 
pope john paul ii has publicly praised the american bishops most 
controversial efforts their national pastoral letters taking issue 
with reagan administration policies on nuclear weapons and on 
treatment of the poor 
however vatican officials noting the rising prominence of 
national bishops conferences have taken pains to point out publicly 
that such organizations are not part of the roman churchs 
traditional hierarchy 
the vatican draft attempts to make that same point saying 
bishops conferences have little real standing that the church 
lodges authority in the individual bishops under the pope the 
bishop of rome 
the us bishops in their reply do not lay out a case arguing 
that the vatican is wrong rather they argue that the vatican 
distorts some evidence and gives only one side of the matter in its 
draft 
earlier this week as the conferences annual meeting got under 
way bishop james malone of youngstown ohio a former conference 
president announced that the proposed notice of rejection already 
widely publicized in news stories had been rewritten 
gone from the bishops proposed description of the vatican draft 
were such phrases as rigid and confusing and overly defensive 
and negative 
then wednesday by voice vote the bishops deleted these words 
non placet the draft is not suitable several bishops had 
argued that the phrase especially the formal latin was too blunt 
bordering on being offensive to the vatican 
still the final version says elsewhere we do not believe that 
the working document is suitable as a basis for discussion 
cardinal bernard law of boston called for removal of that 
sentence too but when he saw the other side had more votes he 
withdrew his amendment saying half a loaf is better than none 
some bishops have criticized news accounts of the dispute 
however archbishop john roach of st paulminneapolis another 
former conference president who served on malones committee in 
preparing the bishops response said the news media did us a real 
favor in publicizing negative aspects of the original version of 
the response 
they perceived a sharpness in the tone of the document which i 
dont think we intended and helped spur the bishops to change that 
tone he said at a news conference 
on another topic the bishops voted wednesday to set guidelines 
on who can preach during catholic masses and when 
several bishops said the guidelines could lead to more preaching 
by lay men and women but others noted the guidelines clear 
strictures against anyone other than an ordained minister giving the 
main sermon interpreting the gospel during mass 
retired bishop william mcmanus of fort waynesouth bend ind 
argued that reiterating that implicit ban on some preaching by women 
who cannot be ordained as catholic ministers would be an 
unnecessary new source of irritation for women in the 
denomination 
he put forward what he described as the ridiculous possibility 
that a local church would have mother teresa as its guest but could 
allow her to speak only early in the service or at the very end 
leaving the main sermon to a male deacon parroting bible lessons 
he learned in the second grade

estonias parliament declared the tiny 
baltic republic sovereign wednesday with the right to veto 
soviet laws deputies said too much kremlin control had ruined the 
economy and environment 
the vote of 2581 with five abstentions on the declaration of 
sovereignty followed a restrained serious debate in the supreme 
soviet of the baltic republic 
its declaration stopped short of complete independence but calls 
for a treaty with moscow that would determine the further status 
of estonia in the composition of the soviet union 
moscow gave no immediate indication of its reaction to the 
apparent attempt to subordinate soviet law to the will of estonias 
highest government body 
in the first report by official national media moscow radio said 
without comment that by a majority of votes members of estonias 
parliament gave priority to estonias laws over national ones 
proponents of the estonian action said it was consistent with 
president mikhail s gorbachevs calls for greater democratization 
and local control and with ritual declarations of autonomy for the 
republics contained in the soviet constitution 
similar proclamations in other baltic and nonslavic republics 
could follow 
marju lauristen a leader of the estonian peoples front a 
grassroots political organization acknowledged that gorbachev might 
not be pleased 
i personally think that perhaps in the beginning hell be 
angry she said in an interview but when he thinks deeply 
hell think weve supported perestroika more deeply than he 
expected moscow could have expected worse 
perestroika is what gorbachev calls his plans for economic and 
social reform in the soviet union 
deputies voted on the declaration after a full day of debate 
televised from tallinns 18th century toompea palace in which they 
detailed the republics need to control its own land factories and 
laws 
a vote on related amendments to the estonian constitution passed 
2547 minutes before the vote on the declaration 
among the amendments was one subjecting new soviet laws to local 
control if the presidium estonias top executive body rejected a 
soviet law the amendment would postpone its application until the 
next meeting of the supreme soviet said igor grazin a law 
professor who wrote the amemdment 
if the parliament concurs the law would be declared void in 
estonia he said 
the other four amendments add human and civil rights guarantees 
claim the land and natural resources of the republic as the property 
of estonia rather than of the state and guarantee the right to 
hold private property 
the passage of such measures by a government body is an 
unprecedented act of defiance toward central authorities in a nation 
still feeling its way through gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
greater openness 
the parliament compromised on a resolution that originally 
demanded that moscow cancel plans to amend the soviet constitution 
after soviet leaders hinted that this would be fruitless and said 
that further amendements would safeguard the rights of the republics 
estonian lawmakers instead unanimously called for changes in the 
amendments to reduce the shift in power from the 15 soviet republics 
to the central government in moscow and to retain the republics 
right to secede 
the soviet amendments which also remove the republics right to 
secede are scheduled for adoption nov 29 and authorities have 
shown no sign of backing down despite opposition in estonia and the 
other baltic republics latvia and lithuania the three were 
independent states until a 1939 pact deeded control to the kremlin 
estonian radio reported wednesday that 26 million people in the 
three republics have signed petitions opposing the soviet 
amendments that would represent nearly a third of the republics 
combined populations of 77 million people 
deputies from largely russianspeaking regions and factories in 
estonia complained of haste in the proposals for estonian 
sovereignty and pleaded for delay more often than outright defeat of 
the measures 
they have been proposed behind our backs complained vladimir 
andreyev a russian power plant mechanic from narva 
estonian activists strategy rests on the traditional claim of 
the soviet union to be a federation of independent republics the 
activists say they are simply reminding authorities in moscow that 
they were promised such sovereignty when estonia was absorbed by the 
soviet union 
peoples front leader edgar savisaar said a recent opinion poll 
found that 56 percent of the estonianspeaking population and 10 
percent of the russianspeaking population of the republic favor 
secession as a last resort 
the republic of 16 million people is by no means united behind 
the measures a competing movement called the internationalists 
has been telling russian speakers that the estonian nationalist mood 
will lead to discrimination against them 
lawmakers on wednesday also unanimously named indrek k toome a 
reformminded communist party official as the republics prime 
minister

a bankruptcy court judge on wednesday threw 
out pending offers for ptls assets and ordered an auction thursday 
in the federal courtroom with bidding to begin at 115 million 
its really wide open ptl bankruptcy trustee mc red 
benton said after the wednesday afternoon hearing 
though bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds still must approve any 
buyer his order signals an approaching end to months of delays in 
selling the ministrys satellite television ministry heritage usa 
theme park and 1700 acres of undeveloped property near fort mill 
proceeds will go toward satisfying the ministrys debts 
estimated to be as high as 130 million and which include some 55 
million claimed by the internal revenue service 
reynolds said neither a 115 million financed offer by toronto 
businessman stephen mernick nor a 113 million financed or 70 
million cash bid by vancouver businessman peter thomas were 
acceptable in part he said thats because all contained clauses 
allowing the buyer to walk away from the purchase within a certain 
time after closing 
benton had recommended mernick as the ministrys buyer 
neither mernick nor thomas would say whether they intended to bid 
at the public auction set for 930 am 
thomas said he planned to attend and would consider his position 
overnight mernick spokesman alex coffin said mernick did not plan 
to attend 
hes just carefully considering this coffin said of 
reynolds ruling and will make his decisions known tomorrow 
benton said the two men remain the most viable bidders but that 
he expects several other groups to try to meet the 1 million 
reynolds set as the entrance fee thomas and mernick are not 
required to put up the money since their financial backing already 
has been examined 
bidders have been eyeing the ptl ministry since this spring when 
reynolds ordered that plans to liquidate the ministry begin 
in addition to forbidding a socalled walkaway provision 
reynolds outlined several conditions any purchaser must meet 
a deposit of 5 percent of the total purchase price must be made 
if money is borrowed using the assets as collateral the first 
50 million borrowed must go toward the purchase of anything above 
that half must go toward the purchase and the other half toward 
making capital improvements on the property 
the balance must be paid off over five years with terms over 
the first four years similar to those of a 9 percent 25year loan 
the remaining balance must be paid in the fifth year 
mernick had proposed no downpayment and planned to borrow 80 
million against the property with which he would pay 50 million 
toward the purchase the remaining 65 million would have been paid 
within five years with the bulk in the fifth year 
ptl filed for bankruptcy protection in june 1987 three months 
after its founder jim bakker stepped aside after admitting having a 
sexual encounter with church secretary jessica hahn 
bakkers own 172 million bid for the ministry fell through in 
september when he was unable to raise a 3 million downpayment he 
received a further setback last week when reynolds ordered bakker 
his wife tammy and former aide david taggart to repay ptl nearly 
77 million in excessive benefits 
bakker was not present at the hearing and calls to bakker 
attorney ryan hovis office in rock hill were unanswered wednesday 
evening

a federal judge who criticized orkin 
exterminating cos scary disregard of safety standards fined 
the corporation 350000 wednesday for a fumigation that killed a 
galax couple 
its almost a miracle that something like this didnt happen 
before us district judge james turk said in sentencing orkin 
for failing to monitor the air in the home of hubert and freida 
watson after it was fumigated on sept 25 1986 watson 73 died 
three days after the fumigation with the chemical vikane and mrs 
watson 65 died in three more days 
i have no doubt at all but that they died from vikane 
poisoning the judge said its nothing short of scary the way 
the company was handling its business 
turk imposed the maximum 500000 fine but told orkin officials 
they will only have to pay 350000 if the company stays out of 
trouble for a twoyear probationary period the judge also ordered 
corporate officials to perform 2000 hours of community service 
although none of the officials was named a defendant in the case 
i think naturally were disappointed orkin spokeswoman judy 
donner said wednesday evening from the companys atlanta 
headquarters the company wants to express sympathy to the watson 
family for the loss 
orkin president bob mercer was the final witness in the twoday 
sentencing hearing for orkins onecount conviction the company was 
convicted of failing to follow directions on the label of the vikane 
container when it did not monitor the air in the watson home as the 
fumigation tent shrouding the home was removed and the watsons were 
allowed back inside 
evidence indicated orkin also failed to remove a waterproof 
mattress cover that could have trapped the poisonous gas 
that was a tomb sealed up waiting for the occupants to enter 
and lay down and die assistant us attorney richard pierce said 
orkin reached an outofcourt settlement with the familys estate 
two months ago neither side has disclosed the terms 
several past and present orkin employees testified that 
throughout numerous fumigations in virginia safety standards 
including the air monitoring were never followed the former orkin 
employee who supervised the fumigation ronald dean mullins 
testified that he had never even read the fine print on a vikane 
label 
i recognize there was a failure to carry out orkins policy and 
procedure mercer testified wednesday he said that since he 
became president in february the company has worked to improve its 
training 
ms donner would not comment when asked whether orkin procedures 
were being followed in other states 
asked whether orkin management monitors compliance or 
noncompliance with safety standards throughout the nation ms 
donner said i think id like to stick to comment on the case 
itself 
turk convicted orkin in august after the government and the 
company agreed to a set of facts concerning the exterminators 
failure to use the air monitor the judge threw out four other 
counts alleging unsafe application of the vikane 
defense attorney sam wilson said monitoring the watson home for 
vikane might not have made a difference because in 1986 the pest 
control industry used monitors that have since become outdated but 
the judge said that testimony indicated the old monitors erred on 
the side of safety

a top military officer said wednesday 
that soldiers or police could be behind some of the recent 
disappearances of scores of human rights activists and unionists 
but brig gen alexander aguirre the manilaarea regional 
commander also said in a telephone interview that reports of 
disappearances could be part of a smear campaign to discredit the 
armed forces 
it could be that they voluntarily disappeared or people went 
underground aguirre said it appears also there is a pattern of 
smear campaign of making conclusions that disappearances were 
caused by the military 
aguirre did not rule out that military personnel were responsible 
for some of the disappearances 
the other possibility is that it could have been done by some 
of our agents aguirre added thats not sanctioned by the 
military 
meanwhile suspected communist rebels fatally shot an officer of 
president corazon aquinos guards wednesday as he was driving along 
a coastal highway south of the capital 
police said lt jerson nueva 31 an officer of mrs aquinos 
elite presidential security group was found slumped at the wheel of 
his car with a gunshot wound in the head 
police speculated that nueva may have been slain by communist 
guerrillas the rebels have claimed responsibility for killing 
soldiers and policemen here since 1987 
also wednesday military chief of staff gen renato de villa 
summoned senior officers to discuss the recent wave of 
disappearances of trade unionists human rights workers and 
leftists aguirre was among those attending the session 
armed forces spokesman col oscar florendo said he had no 
knowledge of the meeting but added the military is preparing a 
report within the week on the cases of 73 missing unionists 
the task force detainees of the philippines a churchaffiliated 
organization says 82 social activists leftists and trade union 
organizers have disappeared nationwide during the first six months 
of 1988 
the leftwing new patriotic alliance said 15 of its members had 
disappeared in the manila area so far this year 
military officials claim the alliance is a front for the banned 
communist party of the philippines which has been waging a 
19yearold insurgency to establish a marxist state 
amnesty international reported this year that more than 100 
leftist and social activists were slain in the philippines in 1987 
apparently by military and paramilitary groups battling the 
communist insurgency 
leftist and human rights groups have blamed the military for the 
disappearances which they say is part of an effort to crush legal 
leftwing organizations 
on tuesday mrs aquino said allegations that the military was 
behind the disappearances were premature and unfounded 
mrs aquino succeeded ferdinand marcos in a february 1986 popular 
uprising and pledged to end the human rights abuses that were 
rampant during her predecessors 20year administration

the chairman of a senate narcotics panel said 
wednesday that latin american drug cartels pose a more immediate 
and effective national security threat than the spread of 
communism and the united states should be willing to provide 
military aid to drugfighting nations 
the drug cartels do represent a national security threat to the 
united states and our friends and allies abroad the sooner we 
understand this fact of life the sooner we can begin waging a 
serious war on drugs said sen john f kerry dmass just say 
no is just not enough it just hasnt worked 
kerry chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on 
narcotics terrorism and international operations said the new 
administration must focus its national security initiatives on the 
narcotics trade 
in the postworld war ii era the national security focus of 
the united states was framed by our predominate concern with 
marxist expansion which led to a series of extraordinary steps 
to respond to that threat such as the marshall plan nato the 
nuclear buildup and involvement in korea and vietnam kerry said 
now we must take equally drastic steps to combat the new threat 
to our national security the tide of drugs which are flooding our 
hemisphere he said 
outlining a strategic drug initiative in remarks prepared for 
an evening address at georgetown university kerry said the bush 
administration should be willing to provide with congressional 
approval military assistance to latin american governments trying 
to fight drug trafficking 
if our allies need hardware to fight the war on drugs we 
should give it to them kerry said if they want help in taking 
out a cocaine processing lab we should provide that assistance if 
they want help in the tracking of drug traffickers on aircraft and 
ships we should offer that help 
the senator also advocated a sweeping economic aid program 
similar to the marshall plan imposed after world war ii to help 
western europe to bolster devastated latin american economies and 
help reduce their reliance on the drug trade 
all of us are concerned about the spread of communism in latin 
america and elsewhere but we cannot afford to put on blinders to 
other threats which are equally grave drugs in this hemisphere are 
an equal threat and they are a more immediate and effective 
threat the senator said 
kerry whose subcommittee has been investigating drug trafficking 
in latin america for two years also called for a drug summit with 
western hemisphere presidents stiffer bank regulations to halt 
money laundering and improved information exchanges among various 
us intelligence agencies

florida us senate race to republican connie mack on wednesday 
eight days after their tight election 
this election is over mackay told reporters at his home here 
he said he would challenge none of the alleged irregularities 
that had spurred him to ask for second looks at the voting in five 
large counties 
we have satisfied ourselves that all the votes that were cast 
were counted and thats all we wanted said the 55yearold 
threeterm congressman who lost by more than 31000 votes the 
people have spoken congratulations to connie mack 
mack vacationing in vermont told the associated press 
obviously im very excited its been a long election night that 
has gone from 24 hours to seven days and were delighted to have it 
over with 
mack had claimed victory nov 10 after absentee ballots gave him 
a decisive lead 
he got 2048458 votes to mackays 2016867 a lead of 31591 
out of nearly 41 million votes cast in the race in unofficial 
returns 
mackay dismissed suggestions he had tarnished his reputation by 
refusing to concede earlier 
one thing worse than sour grapes is rotten grapes and thats 
what we would have had if some voters felt their votes were lost 
mackay said referring to his campaigns claim that up to 170000 
votes for the senate race may have been missed in totals 
he said he was making sure that florida voters were protected 
which should only help his reputation 
his campaign cited steep dropoffs from presidential to senate 
vote totals in four large counties mackay showed charts here 
reporting that in 63 of 67 counties there were more senate votes 
than presidential votes 
after his narrow loss mackay said sharp dropoffs in the senate 
vote totals compared with other races could have indicated computer 
problems 
mackay was unwilling to prolong his challenge however by filing 
lawsuits to seek courtordered recounts 
the mack campaign said a variety of other factors including 
voter apathy or indecisiveness could be blamed for the dropoffs in 
the senate race 
palm beach county officials did a spotcheck of some precincts 
wednesday and found no evidence of the computer irregularities 
alleged by mackay 
mackay accompanied by his wife anne said he hadnt had time to 
decide about whether he will ever seek an elective office again

the national economic commission opened its 
postelection attempt to break a sevenyear deadlock on the budget 
deficit with repeated warnings wednesday that the deficit represents 
the nations greatest economic threat 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan one of the leadoff 
witnesses before the bipartisan panel said the deficit already 
has begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength 
and the need to deal with it is becoming ever more urgent 
greenspan joined other witnesses in saying that congress and 
presidentelect george bush must reach agreement quickly on ways to 
slash the deficit or run the risk that foreigners will stop 
financing americas borrowing needs 
we must put our fiscal house in order so that we can address 
the other problems which are important to us as a nation said 
alice rivlin former head of the congressional budget office 
getting the budget deficit behind us is a test of our ability to 
govern 
the comments offered a sharp contrast to much of the debate 
during the presidential campaign when both candidates sidestepped 
questions concerning the deficit because they did not want to offer 
detailed solutions 
however some of the witnesses said bush now that he is 
presidentelect very well could be forced by events in financial 
markets to seriously bargain with congress or risk triggering a 
freefall in the value of the us dollar 
the rest of the world may well give up on the dollar if it 
foresees four more years of towering twin budget and trade 
deficits said c fred bergsten head of the institute for 
international economics 
investors have been unusually jittery in the past week over 
concerns that bushs tough stance against new taxes and the larger 
democratic marjorities in congress would translate into further 
gridlock on solving the deficit problem 
the dollar has come under heavy selling pressure since the 
presidential election and that selloff continued wednesday putting 
further downward pressure on us stocks the dow jones industrial 
average plunged by more than 38 points resuming a sharp decline 
that began last week 
a fall in the dollar sends us stocks tumbling because investors 
fear that interest rates will have to rise in this country to 
continue to attract the needed foreign investments rising us 
interest rates reduce business prospects and raise threats of a 
recession 
responding to the market concerns bush has pledged to make the 
budget deficit a top priority however he has not indicated any 
willingness to abandon his flexible freeze proposal by which 
overall spending increases excluding social security and interest 
on the debt would be held to the rise in inflation each year 
while bushs economic advisers have insisted that the country 
could grow its way out of deficit problem without sharp spending 
cuts or tax increases greenspan rejected such a notion he 
indicated that tough choices would have to be made on spending cuts 
to get the deficit under control 
but greenspan supported the bush contention that the deficit 
should be reduced on the spending side rather than by boosting taxes 
however if spending cuts alone are not sufficient to narrow the 
deficit greenspan said tax hikes should be considered because the 
need to cut the deficit was so critical 
how it is done is less relevant than that it be done 
greenspan said 
the 12member economic commission chaired by democrat robert 
strauss and republican drew lewis was created by congress a year 
ago to come up with a blueprint for reducing the federal budget 
deficit which climbed to 1551 billion in the fiscal year ending 
last september 
supporters of the commission believe that it offers the best hope 
of crafting a combination of tax increases and spending reductions 
in such politically sensitive programs such as social security 
medicare and defense which could be embraced by the new congress and 
the new administration 
however members of the commission in interviews emphasized 
that much will depend on the final two members of the panel who will 
be appointed by bush and how much negotiating authority he gives 
them 
lewis said the panel has scheduled further public hearings for 
nov 30 dec 7 and dec 12 and at this stage had not reached a 
consensus on any policy recommendations 
but responding to reports that the commission was so divided that 
it would be able to come up with a report lewis said we are 
determined to address this issue and we will be coming back with 
specific recommendations for the next administration 
another witness former labor secretary william brock said the 
commission should recommend boosting the gasoline tax possibly 
increasing it by 10 cents per year over 10 years as a way of 
raising 10 billion in new revenues each year and also cutting the 
countrys dependence on foreign oil 
he said the commission also should support a national sales tax 
such as many european countries have adopted he conceded that both 
of these proposals would be politically painful 
granted this is not going to be politically palatable for a lot 
of folks but the reason we are here is that we spent the last 
couple of decades adding one combination after another of aspirin 
bandaids funny budgets smoke and mirrors he said this 
country is imperiled and it is going to take a whole lot of guts to 
face this fact and deal with it

the truck was abandoned a block away and authorities said they 
believe the two fled in the car a gold sedan with a state 
corrections department symbol on each side 
warden jerry hedrick said he believes the two fled to ohio 
the only reason we feel this was we had a report from a truck 
driver who said he was almost struck by a vehicle fitting the 
description of the car hedrick said 
he said the near collision occurred on the moundsville 12th 
street bridge which leads to ohio 
the escape occurred about 340 pm when the truck crashed

the parents of a braindamaged woman 
cannot have their daughters surgically implanted feeding tube 
removed so she can die as they believe she would want the missouri 
supreme court ruled wednesday 
we find no principled legal basis which permits the 
coguardians in this case to choose the death of their ward the 
court said in a 43 decision 
in the absence of such a legal basis for that decision and in 
the face of this states strongly stated policy in favor of life we 
choose to err on the side of life respecting the rights of 
incompetent persons who may wish to live despite a severely 
diminished quality of life the court said 
it was the first time the state supreme court had taken on a 
righttodie case and specifically ruled whether nutrition and 
hydration ought to be construed as medical treatment that may be 
discontinued if that is what the patient would want 
the courts decision which reverses a lower court ruling 
followed arguments in september on whether joe and joyce cruzan 
should be allowed to order the removal of the feeding tube providing 
nutrition and hydration for their daughter nancy a 31yearold car 
wreck victim 
legal experts say a key point is that the supreme court was not 
being asked to decide whether ms cruzan should die instead the 
court was asked whether her parents as her courtappointed 
guardians have the right to make that decision on her behalf 
doctors say ms cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state 
for five years they say she could live another 3040 years in her 
present state through daily feedings of liquid protein and water 
through the tube that is implanted in her stomach 
the parents wanted doctors at the staterun missouri 
rehabilitation center to remove the feeding tube when the hospital 
refused they sued last year in jasper county circuit court they 
said their daughter indicated a year before her accident that she 
would not want to live in the condition she is now in 
jasper county circuit judge charles teel ruled in july that the 
feeding tube can be removed he said the tube is medical treatment 
because it was surgically implanted he also ruled it was an 
invasive medical procedure which can be refused by a patient under 
the constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy 
under missouris livingwill statute a person can refuse medical 
treatment but it specifically excludes nutrition and hydration from 
the definition of medical treatment because they are considered 
basic necessities of life 
since the 1983 accident ms cruzan has been bedridden unable to 
swallow or to respond to her environment her hands and feet have 
constricted and bent into claw shapes because of the brain damage 
and her eyes constantly blink

arabamericans responded with pride and hope to this weeks plo 
declaration of a palestinian state while a leading jewish group on 
wednesday called the pronouncements in algeria a phony gesture 
in algiers on tuesday yasser arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization declared an independent palestinian state 
with jerusalem as its capital he also said the organization was 
renouncing terrorism and had endorsed key united nations resolutions 
on the middle east including one that partitioned britishmandated 
palestine into jewish and arab states 
i am very excited very happy and optimistic said sana 
ahmad a palestinianamerican who attends classes at william 
paterson college in wayne nj 
i think more people now recognize this is not just an israeli 
problem but also a palestinian problem she said people here 
are questioning more theyre realizing that there are two sides to 
the story 
in downtown st louis on tuesday about 200 people marched in 
support of the declaration some carried palestinian flags and wore 
blackandwhite checkered kafiyehs arab headdresses others held 
banners stating palestinian statehood now and 
selfdetermination for palestine 
we are here as palestinian and arabamericans gathered to bless 
and support the declaration of an independent palestinian state we 
are for peace and prosperity for the whole region said dr za 
dalu chairman of the arabamerican community center of st louis 
it is now up to the israeli government to abide by un 
resolution 242 which calls for independence and prosperity for 
every state 
but in new york the head of the conference of presidents of 
major american jewish organizations said the palestine national 
councils actions announced by arafat amounted to smokescreens 
i say it is a phony gesture what we have here is a 
declaration for propaganda said morris b abram chairman of the 
conference that represents 46 american jewish organizations 
the plo announcement gives the impression of moderation on 
behalf of a violent purpose 
he noted that arafat declined to specify whether the plos 
acceptance of the united nations resolutions meant an explicit 
acceptance of the jewish state 
the palestine national council the parliament in exile rejected 
terrorism but accepted guerrilla actions in israel and the 
territories it has occupied since the 1967 war he added 
this is a forecast of more terrorism to come and not only in 
the socalled occupied territories said abram

benazir bhutto once recalled a day 
nearly a decade ago when she visited her father in jail as he 
awaited execution by the military regime that had toppled his 
civilian government 
i told him on my oath in his death cell i would carry on his 
work ms bhutto said 
her father former prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto was hanged 
in a rawalpindi prison in 1979 two years after being convicted in a 
murder conspiracy gen mohammad zia ulhaq who led the coup that 
unseated bhutto turned down international pleas for sparing him 
today three months after zia died in a mysterious plane crash 
ms bhutto is the undisputed star of pakistani politics as head of 
the populist pakistan peoples party founded by her father 
the charismatic 35yearold ms bhutto inherited the grassroots 
following that brought her father to power in the 1970s in speech 
after speech to adoring crowds she has promised a better life to 
the poor rural masses that form the core of this islamic nation 
ms bhutto was groomed for politics studying by the side of her 
father then focusing on politics and government while at harvard 
and oxford 
her first taste of political success came at the british 
university where she was elected president of the oxford union 
society in 1976 
ms bhutto returned to pakistan in early 1977 to take up a job in 
the foreign office 
the job was shortlived however as zia toppled bhuttos 
government a few months later 
her father was accused of conspiring to murder a political 
opponent and was sentenced to death ms bhutto turned to denouncing 
zia after her struggle to have her father reprieved failed she 
wound up in jail or under house arrest for five years 
not until a serious ear infection required treatment did zia 
allow her release in 1984 to go to england in selfexile 
ms bhutto returned triumphantly to pakistan in april 1986 four 
months after zia announced an end to eight years of military rule 
she drew huge crowds as she toured the nation demanding democracy 
ecstatic crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands would 
chant her name and wait for hours for a glimpse of her 
the stunning comeback led to inevitable comparisons with corazon 
aquino of the philippines who became president after a popular and 
military uprising against ferdinand marcos 
but zia steadfastly refused to allow elections contested by 
political parties in the meantime ms bhutto surprised many 
observers by agreeing to an arranged marriage last december with 
karachi businessman asif ali zardari that followed strict islamic 
tradition 
six months later zia fired his civilian government in july he 
set nov 16 as the date for new elections 
there was considerable speculation that zia who died in an aug 
17 plane crash chose the date to coincide with the birth of ms 
bhuttos first child to keep her off the campaign trail 
but the elections came two months after ms bhutto gave birth to 
a son bilawal on sept 21 giving her time to make whirlwind 
campaign tours throughout the country after a brief bout with a 
kidney infection 
in public ms bhutto is mindful of local custom and islamic 
morality appearing with her head covered and wearing the baggy 
shalwar kameez favored by most pakistani women but she is clearly 
westernized and is as comfortable speaking english as urdu 
poised and articulate she again captivated massive crowds almost 
everywhere she traveled in early november she mounted a 38hour 
31stop railway tour aboard the greenandyellow khyber mail 
train that wound its way 1000 miles through the countrys 
hinterland 
her voice deteriorated into a barely audible rasp as she preached 
the bhutto message handed down by her late father democracy and 
prosperity to the poor masses

state officials verified on wednesday us 
sen malcolm wallops defeat of democratic challenger john vinich by 
1322 votes and they awaited vinichs decision on asking for a 
recount 
after the state canvassing board confirmed the results of the 
senate race as well as wyomings us house contest the 
presidential race and other races a national democratic leader told 
secretary of state kathy karpan that vinich had not told him whether 
he would ask for a recount 
state law calls for an automatic recount if the victory margin is 
less than 1 percent of the votes received by the apparent winner 
the canvassing boards figures reveal wallop collected 91143 
votes to vinichs 89821 putting the race outside the 911vote 
difference that would trigger a recount 
wyomings election code allows candidates to request another 
count of an election but they must pay for the exercise 
a recount would cost vinich a 38yearold state senator up to 
11500 he has until friday afternoon to file for a recount and 
make a 100 deposit 
bob chlopak executive director of the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee told karpan that democratic officials had no 
doubt that wyoming officials were careful in their election work 
but vinich may want a recount anyway because of the narrow margin 
karpan a democrat said she told vinich in a conversation a few 
days ago that if he has a shadow of a doubt about the election 
results he should ask for a recount

the governing liberal democratic party pushed major 
tax reform bills through the house of representatives wednesday a 
major step toward japans first overhaul of its tax system in 40 
years 
the bills now go to the house of councillors where approval is 
expected within a week 
although the japan socialist party the largest opposition group 
and the communist party boycotted the crucial house of 
representatives session the liberal democrats who hold a majority 
in both houses of parliament voted the bills through 
the tax package was passed after government party members reached 
a compromise with some opposition groups on a stocktrading scandal 
but socialist party chairwoman takako doi complained the 
government has not done enough to divulge details of the socalled 
recruit scandal which opposition parties had used to try to stall 
parliamentary action on the tax bills 
the new tax bill is contaminated with the scandal we wont 
accept any offer from the ldp until it discloses the entire 
scandal doi said 
all opposition parties had boycotted parliamentary sessions since 
nov 10 when the government pushed the tax package through the tax 
reform committee 
but the governing party in negotiations that lasted through 
tuesday night got the clean government party and the democratic 
socialist party to attend wednesdays final session 
the government in turn agreed to set up a committee to probe the 
scandal 
late tuesday it submitted to the new committee a list of senior 
politicians and officials who bought unlisted shares in a subsidiary 
of the information conglomerate recruit inc and then profited by 
selling them after the company went public in october 1986 
the list included 26 aides and relatives of top politicians and 
public officials such as prime minister noboru takeshita and former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone they have admitted the 
transactions took place but denied doing any favors for recruit or 
that anything illegal occurred 
opposition legislators charged the list was inadequate 
we all know there were many more buyers of the shares than 
those 26 on the list said nanosuke narazaki an opposition 
lawmaker from the united social democratic party 
the list said 114 other people who were not politicians or public 
officials had also bought the shares but they were identified only 
by occupation 
the liberal democrats could have forced through the tax overhaul 
even if all opposition parties opposed it but it is a tradition of 
the japanese parliament to negotiate issues thoroughly until 
reasonable compromise is reached 
takeshita put tax reform at the top of his priorities but 
progress was slow as the opposition objected to measures in the tax 
package and said the bills were tainted because the drafters 
included people implicated in the recruit scandal 
the bills call for a reduction in corporate and personal income 
taxes but also include an unpopular 3 percent sales tax on almost 
all goods and services the bills reduce the number of income tax 
brackets from six to five and introduce a capital gains tax for the 
first time on profits from share transactions 
a study by a tokyo consumers cooperative has estimated the tax 
plan would mean an annual saving of 800 for a typical fourmember 
household with an annual income of 53500 but opposition parties 
charge the new tax system favors the rich while ignoring lowincome 
households

ms smith will be examined by psychiatrists who will report to 
pulaski county circuit court on her ability to stand trial

tuesday in little rock municipal court and was denied bond 
lisa rutherford a registered nurse said in an interview that 
ms smith was a loving person and took care of her terminally ill 
sister who died early this year 
mrs rutherford said she saw news of ms smiths arrest on 
television and couldnt believe she was charged with the abduction 
because she seemed so levelheaded 
ms smiths sister whose identify was not revealed because of 
patient confidentiality died early this year mrs rutherford would 
not reveal the womans illness 
she ms smith could have deserted her sister mrs 
rutherford said a lot of patients that come in here that have a 
very bad illness their families just totally turn on them 
she could have done that easily but she didnt said mrs 
rutherford an assistant head nurse at the university of arkansas 
for medical sciences 
ms smith allegedly posed as a nurse and took christopher from 
the room of annette thomasjones mrs thomasjones and her husband 
willie jones made several appeals to the abductor through the

state structure the statement said

democratic opposition the statement also outlined policy demands 
for the new president including fixing foreign debt service 
payments to a percentage of export revenues capping the growth of

nicaragua on wednesday called 
the reagan administrations central america policy a failure and 
urged presidentelect george bush to formulate a new one based on 
dialogue and mutual respect 
the nicaraguan position was expressed in a speech to the 
organization of american states general assembly by carlos 
tunnerman nicaraguas ambassador to the oas 
tunnerman served as ambassador to the united states until he was 
expelled by washington in july in retaliation for the leftist 
sandinista governments expulsion of us ambassador richard melton 
and seven other american diplomats 
the failure of us policy in the central american region 
should make the new us authorities reflect and should inspire them 
to construct a new era of relations with the region tunnerman 
told oas delegates 
threats and the use of force should be proscribed forever 
intervention should cease concepts of zones of influence or 
strategic reserves should be abandoned reason should prevail 
over force and dialogue over pressure he said 
since 1981 the reagan administration has supported nicaraguan 
rebels known as contras in their bid to overthrow the sandinistas 
us military aid to the contras expired in february and most of 
the rebels fled to honduras 
the sandinistas and contras signed a ceasefire agreement in 
march but talks on a permanent truce broke down in september 
meanwhile honduran foreign minister carlos lopez contreras told 
the oas assembly that he and his counterparts from nicaragua el 
salvador guatemala and costa rica would meet in mexico on nov 30 
in an effort to breathe new life into the stalled central american 
peace process 
in guatemala president vinicio cerezo arevalo on wednesday said 
he would press for a summit meeting of central american presidents 
before bush is inaugurated on jan 20 
cerezo said the summit agenda would include the reestablishment 
of a verification commission to monitor compliance with a regional 
peace plan signed in august 1987 other topics could include forming 
a central american parliament and environmental issues affecting the 
area 
the central american presidents had considered meeting later this 
month to further define the peace plan 
the pact by costa rican president oscar arias seeks to end wars 
in nicaragua el salvador and guatemala and was signed by those four 
countries and honduras

actress robin givens filed a 125 million libel 
suit wednesday against her estranged husband heavyweight boxing 
champion mike tyson for allegedly telling a newspaper that she was 
trying to steal his money 
the lawsuit filed in federal court in manhattan accused tyson 
of holding givens 23 up to public contempt ridicule 
embarrassment disgrace and prejudice 
the latest swing in the marital punchout between tyson and givens 
stemmed from a nov 7 new york post article that quoted tyson as 
saying givens tried to steal his money and property 
the post was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit which 
described the article as false defamatory malicious and 
libelous 
the new york post had no immediate comment 
tyson and givens married feb 12 have filed for divorce he is 
suing her in new jersey and she is suing him in california 
the lawsuit filed by new york divorce lawyer raoul lionel 
feldberg seeks 25 million for damages and injury and an additional 
100 million in punitive compensatory and special damages 
i think its funny tyson manager bill cayton told the 
associated press 
the lawsuit is outrageous and ludicrous said howard 
weitzman tysons lawyer this young lady once again is attempting 
to shift blame from her conduct to someone else and blame them for 
any problems she perceives shes having 
what mike said in the post interview he believed to be true 
based on the fact that robin refused to give to his lawyers books 
and records relating to his money that she misrepresented to the 
public when she said she did not want any money when in fact she 
had at first demanded 8 million and then reduced it to between 1 
to 2 million 
among the tyson quotes in the post article that angered his wife 
were lines such as she manipulated me now it turns out she 
was lying when she said she didnt want anything from me 
the article also quoted tyson as saying the nature of those 
two women givens and her mother ruth roper is to be mean and 
vindictive she said she wants nothing but she refused to sign a 
release 
also and she givens stole money from me when we were 
together 
givens also claimed that during the same period he was talking to 
the post tyson was calling her so often that she was forced to 
disconnect her telephone

allowed to stand in the way 
sakharov the soviet unions most celebrated human rights 
activist told a black tie audience of some 750 people in a hotel 
ballroom that he has great respect for teller and believes he is a 
man of conviction and principle 
but he said he strongly disagrees with teller on the issue of 
deploying the strategic defense initiative popularly known as star 
wars 
i consider such a system to be a great error sakharov said 
i feel it would destabilize the world 
enormous costs would be incurred by deploying an american 
defensive system and by creating a new soviet offensive system to 
counteract the shield he said 
if such systems are deployed there would be a temptation to 
destroy them and this in itself could trigger a nuclear war 
sakharov said sdi is one of the problems that stands in the way 
of achieving really deep and profound arms control 
in a reply delivered after sakharovs departure teller 
portrayed the soviet physicist as a great man who nonetheless is 
out of touch with technological advances in space defense including 
developments in the soviet union which he said is further ahead in 
the field than is the united states 
i am not sure he has realized yet what our president has 
envisioned teller said 
he said that in announcing the sdi five years ago reagan asked 
that a spacebased defense use nonnuclear weapons if that proved 
possible 
and year after year it turns out it looks better and better 
teller said we are seeing developments coming from many sides 
he said he remains convinced that we must know what can be 
known about the defense system we must find out whether it 
will work 
but he said that he and sakharov have no argument on one score 
you have heard his ideas about a peaceful future he said 
he wants peace i want peace every one of us wants peace there 
is no possible difference on that one 
sakharov 67 who is on a threeweek us visit spent years of 
internal exile in the soviet city of gorky due to his human rights 
activities he met monday with president reagan and wednesday with 
presidentelect george bush 
the award to teller presented by the ethics and public policy 
center was accompanied by a citation which said that tellers motto 
better a shield than a sword expresses a timeless truth 
sakharov noted that he and teller for years had led their lives 
on a parallel course in their countries nuclear weapons 
development programs 
i was involved in the work on thermonuclear weapons sakharov 
said his words translated by an interpreter i was completely 
convinced that this work was essential that it was vitally 
important 
he said that while he had not fought in world war ii the work 
in which i was involved was also a kind of war 
sakharov said this was the case because similar work was being 
carried out in the united states where the american scientists 
regarded it with the same feelings that it was vital for the 
interests of the country and for maintaining peace through 
nuclear deterrence 
but i think what we were doing at that time was a great 
tragedy he said the tragic state of the world made it 
necessary to maintain the peace of the world and to do such terrible 
things at least at the time we were doing it we were convinced this 
was the best way to maintain the peace 
sakharov said that with the soviet unions new policies and 
progress being made by both sides on arms control the world has 
entered a new era and new approaches are necessary he said there 
are issues on which he and teller agree including assuring the 
safety of nuclear energy 
it is important that the two superpowers are able to talk out of 
their disagreements on the star wars issue he said adding at 
least we will understand each others point of view and be able to 
talk instead of creating a situation of confrontation

the massachusetts supreme court on wednesday 
unanimously threw out regulations that would have banned aids 
testing for health insurance and other forms of coverage 
its decision the court said was based solely on the question of 
the insurance commissioners authority and has nothing to do with 
the substantive merits of the aidstesting regulations or with the 
need for their adoption 
we conclude that the insurance commissioner had no authority 
express or implied to adopt the regulations challenged in this 
case justice herbert p wilkins wrote for a unanimous court 
the court said it was up to the legislature to decide whether to 
give the insurance commissioner such authority 
i am very pleased with the decision said william carroll 
executive director of the life insurance association of 
massachusetts which along with several insurance companies appealed 
the regulations we felt that the authority issue was the most 
critical issue of the case 
denise mcwilliams of the gay and lesbian advocates and defenders 
group which intervened in support of insurance commissioner roger 
singer said the result will be that it is going to make it 
impossible for people to get insurance particularly those 
individuals who are just tested positive 
beyond that she said i think the longterm effects can be 
truly staggering because obviously if folks cant get private 
insurance they are going to be thrown onto the public rolls i 
frankly dont think thats fair to anybodys interest 
gov michael s dukakis called the decision a setback for our 
efforts to deal responsibly with the issues of aids testing and the 
use of aidsrelated information for life and health insurance 
i continue to believe in the need for regulations that are 
reasonable to the industry and fair to those they insure he added 
singer issued the regulations on sept 11 1987 making 
massachusetts only the second state after new york to ban by 
regulation health insurance testing for antibodies to the human 
immunodeficiency virus associated with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
only california and the district of columbia have passed laws 
banning aids testing for health insurance 
under the massachusetts regulations aids testing would be banned 
for all health insurance any group life and most disability 
insurance testing would be allowed under controlled conditions for 
individual life and noncancellable disability insurance 
the regulations said that insurance companies who wished to test 
must offer notest policies of up to 100000 with an aids 
exclusion companies could also offer any policy with a notest aids 
exclusion which could later be removed if the individual 
policyholder furnished proof of a negative test for the aids 
antibody 
the regulations never went into effect because of the insurance 
industrys appeal

with their 55th and final state dinner on 
wednesday president and mrs reagan closed the book on one of their 
favorite white house events one for which they rekindled a 
tradition of glitz and glamour dating to john adams new years day 
bash in 1801 
though most presidents have made the white house a stage for some 
of the nations most elaborate and exclusive entertainment the 
reagans brought back a hollywood party style to an executive mansion 
shorn of hard liquor and dancing during the carter years 
mrs reagan asked as her guests arrived why british prime

mrs reagan also wore a brilliant multistone necklace that appeared 
to be made of diamonds and sapphires but her spokeswoman elaine 
crispen described it as definitely costume 
wednesday nights blacktie tribute to mrs thatcher was an apt 
finale to a glittering series in which reagan now 77 never seemed 
to tire regaling his guests with anecdotes both at the dinner 
table or while working the afterdinner demitasse crowd in the blue 
room 
and after an evenings entertainment ranging from the dance 
theater of harlem to wednesdays pianist michael feinstein the 
first couple virtually never failed to take a nearmidnight turn 
about the marbled dance floor while their guests lingered over 
champagne 
mrs thatcher was the first foreign leader to be honored by the 
couple at such an event which took place on feb 26 1981 a month 
after reagan took office

husband dennis was also an honored guest 
the two leaders soulmates of staunch conservatism spent a 
good part of the day trading laudatory statements about the success 
of their eightyear alliance 
but despite the prime ministers usually patrician demeanor the 
farewell day was a time to have a bit of fun as well 
at a state department luncheon of monkfish and venison secretary 
of state george shultz presented mrs thatcher with a black patent 
leather handbag saying hed grown used to seeing her pull perfect 
compromises from her bag like a rabbit out of a hat 
while presidentelect george bush was invited in his no 2 
capacity vice presidentelect dan quayle was not on the evening 
guest list 
white house aides scrambled to explain that quayle had been 
invited to a dinner in 1982 as part of the normal congressional 
contingent and that hed be going to many many more such events 
after the change in administrations 
members of congress invited to wednesdays dinner included reps 
trent lott rmiss dick cheney rwyo and tom foley dwash as 
well as sens mark hatfield rore ted stevens rala and robert

academia and captains of industry

artistic director mikhail baryshnikov discovery space shuttle

a jewish civil rights group expressed concern 
wednesday about john sununu whom sources say has been tapped to be 
white house chief of staff because of his failure to support a 
measure that condemned an antizionist un resolution 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith issued a statement 
saying sununu the retiring governor of new hampshire was the only 
governor who refused to endorse a proclamation attacking a 1975 un 
resolution that equated zionism with racism 
at a news conference in concord nh sununu who is 
arabamerican said he did not endorse the proclamation sponsored by 
zionist groups because it would have been inappropriate 
i have said very clearly that it was inappropriate for a 
governor to try to issue something that would have as its focus an 
attempt to influence foreign policy he said 
but he said that he made sure that the condemnation of the un 
resolution found its way into the republican party platform at the 
national convention last summer sununu was presidentelect george 
bushs liaison to the gop platform committee 
so i dont have a problem supporting that in the proper 
context he said 
sources have said bush has picked sununu to be the chief of 
staff bush has not made a formal announcement and sununu has not 
confirmed or denied the reports 
the adl in a statement from its new york office said that 
sununu was the only governor out of 50 not to endorse the 
proclamation a position which put him at odds with president 
reagan vice president bush and both houses of congress 
despite its criticism of sununu the adl said the governor has 
issued proclamations commemorating israels 40th anniversary and 
efforts on behalf of soviet jewry 
as chief of staff gov sununu will bear a major responsibility 
for facilitating the implementation of the new presidents program 
and policies as reflected in the republican party platform we hope 
and trust he will meet the responsibility the adl statement said 
bush asked about some criticism of sununu from jewish leaders 
defended the new hampshire governor as being sensitive to isreali 
concerns 
sununu is practically the author of the best party platform on 
the middle east that any party has ever had the presidentelect 
said 
bush however would only shake his head and laugh when asked 
when he would announce his choice for chief of staff 
sununu said he had no problem in stating rather clearly that 
he believes a key to peace in the middle east is the assurance of 
the integrity and protection of the state of israel 
president reagan asked for his view on the reported asignment of 
sununu to the chief of staff post praised his record as governor 
i have great admiration for him ive seen him as governor and 
what hes done hes a great governor and if thats what turns 
out that he becomes chief of staff hell do a remarkable job 
reagan said 
the president added that bush has not asked any advice about 
possible appointments but that he would gladly offer it if asked

they were neighbors schoolmates and friends and 
between them they had one sound heart 
the first thing that went through my mind is that a friend of 
mine is dead 18yearold maria ortiz said wednesday from her bed 
at the university of illinoischicago hospital where she is 
recovering from heart transplant surgery after receiving a surprise 
gift the heart of a friend 
now ive got a chance and ill be real happy because i know 
the girl and i know most likely how she was and ill feel better 
than having a strangers heart in me she said 
at least she added i knew her 
ms ortiz lived all her young life with a weakening heart muscle 
after an attack late nov 4 or early nov 5 she was brought to the 
intensive care unit at illinois masonic hospital where doctors 
feared she had only days left to live 
ms ortiz began to accept that she might never see her 
4monthold daughter grow up in a waiting room nearby her mother 
carmen geliga struck up a conversation with another woman whose 
daughter was in the same unit with a neurological disorder that had 
left her brain dead but with a healthy heart 
ms geliga had no idea then that their daughters had exchanged 
greetings at the neighborhood pool and talked occasionally in the 
halls at roberto clemente high school before maria dropped out 
i wanted to ask her but i couldnt because it seemed very 
cruel to come out and say please give us her heart ms geliga 
recalled 
instead she went home and prayed when she returned to the 
hospital ms geliga learned the woman had asked to speak with her 
i had sorrow for her because she was losing her daughter and 
its hard to accept because her daughter was leaving and mine was 
going on me also then she just says to me i want to donate my 
daughters heart so that your daughter can go on living 
one minute we didnt have anything ms geliga said the 
next minute we had everything 
both girls were moved to the university of illinois hospital 
where the operation was begun late nov 6 and completed early nov 
7 said hospital spokesman michael a maggio 
neither ms ortiz nor her mother knew the donor was a friend 
until other friends of the two teenagers made the connection 
doctors have pronounced the transplanted heart an excellent 
match and say ms ortiz chances for survival are promising 
candace wiberg organ procurement coordinator at the hospital 
said doctors bypassed a state protocol for chosing a recipient from 
among all eligible patients because the donors mother likely 
wouldnt have donated it unless she knew maria would get it 
organ rejection remains a concern but medical literature suggest 
ms ortizs chances of survival are 80 percent or better through the 
first year and 60 percent or better through five years 
theyre probably better than that said dr sidney levitsky 
head of cardiothoracic surgery at university of illinois hospital 
in recent years better antirejection drugs have improved the 
chances of survival 
ms ortiz says she has occasional bouts of sadness over her 
friends fate and promises one of her first trips when she returns 
home will be to visit her friends mother 
i will try to be just like a daughter to her because i have 
part of her daughter in me she said 
ms ortiz might find additional comfort in the story of donna 
ashlock a patterson calif girl who nearly three years ago 
received a transplant from a high school admirer felipe garza who 
was 15 at the time died of a brain hemorrhage after telling his 
parents he wanted donna to have his heart 
ms ashlock has been hospitalized several times for episodes of 
organ rejection but with medication and a diet modified to lower 
cholesterol and salt intake she has gone on to live a normal life 
ms ortiz hopes to do the same 
ill go swimming bike riding and do lots of things i couldnt 
have done before she said and really enjoy my life

the us trade deficit narrowed by 17 percent 
to 105 billion in september the government said wednesday but 
not enough to prevent a new assualt on the dollar over worries about 
what the head of the federal reserve called a dangerous 
corrosion of the american economy 
exports rose by 700 million to a record high 282 billion the 
commerce department said imports declined by 25 percent or 11 
billion to 387 billion from a record high in august the 105 
billion trade gap for september was down by 18 billion from the 
revised august trade deficit figure of 123 billion 
but neither change was big enough to stem a new selling wave of 
dollars by traders worried about inflation from an overheating 
economy and skeptical of presidentelect george bushs promise to 
reduce the federal budget deficit through a flexible freeze 
without any tax increases 
the dollar resuming its downward path of last week fell nearly 
1 percent against the japanese yen to 12224 yen despite what 
currency traders said was intervention by the fed to prop it up 
through massive purchases of dollars using yen the figure was the 
lowest close against the yen in new york trading since modern 
exchange rates were established in the late 1940s the dollar also 
fell 15 percent against the west german mark

talkshow host oprah winfreys weight loss of 67 
pounds has spurred new interest in liquid diets but experts said 
wednesday many people should avoid such diets and nobody should try 
them without medical supervision 
these were not made for the majority of dieters who want to 
lose 10 or 15 pounds said mary lee chin a denver consulting 
dietician and spokesperson for the american dietetic association 
winfrey 34 announced on her show tuesday that she had lost the 
weight in four months through a supervised liquid diet program and 
that a cheeseburger was the only solid food she had eaten since july 
7 
chin said liquid diet programs should be considered only by 
people who are above their weight by 20 percent to 30 percent or by 
at least 50 pounds or whose weight poses a medical risk and a 
liquid diet should be considered only after conventional diets fail 
she said

in the complexity of life aids victims tell a 
truth about it challenging modern illusions of immortality they 
illuminate a universal reality that death comes to all 
their suffering also can be a means of grace for them and 
others says the rev david felter of kansas city mo who helped 
initiate a special selection of scripture for aids patients 
if the sufferer can accept gods acceptance of himself he is 
free liberated to offer his own suffering under god as a 
sacrament felter said in a telephone interview 
if he accepts that reality not with the acquiescence of 
defeat but with a triumphalness of spirit we see something ugly 
but nevertheless inevitable changed from a final enemy to a doorway 
to a new and better existence 
indications of that enlightening assurance that can come through 
difficulty run through a small booklet of scripture passages issued 
by the american bible society to help in coping with aids 
called nothing can separate us from the love of god the 
booklet includes 22 passages from the old and new testament such as 
the 23rd psalm which reads in part 
even if i go through the deepest darkness i will not be 
afraid lord for you are with me 
it is regarded the first time nationally that a special 
collection of bible passages has been issued to bolster the spirits 
of those stricken with aids presently incurable and always fatal 
who then can separate us from the love of christ says romans 
8 can trouble do it or hardship or persecution or hunger or 
poverty or danger or death no in all these things we have 
complete victory through him who loved us 
the passages are in the simplified translation of the good news 
bible in todays english emphasizing gods backing in the worst 
times of helplessness abandonment and fear 
you threw me down into the depths to the very bottom of the 
sea where the waters were all around me reads jonah 2 but 
you o lord my god brought me back from the depths alive 
the idea for the booklet grew out of a consultation of 
denominational representatives at which felter longtime pastor and 
now training coordinator for the church of the nazarene cited the 
need for such material 
telling of a couple whose son was stricken with aids he said 
this kind of thing hurts so much and weve been ill equipped to 
provide any kind of real strengthening in these cases 
the project for the booklet resulted chaplains and others who 
work with aids patients reviewed the manuscript and expressed 
approval of passages chosen 
jesus answered i have not come to call respectable 
people but outcasts reads matthew 9 
the booklet is being made available to hospitals hospices 
church groups and individuals who minister to people with aids 
we despised him and rejected him he endured suffering and pain 
we ignored him as if he were nothing go verses in isaiah 53 
and 52 yet many will see and understand something they had never 
known 
felter said that in our deathdenying society aids remind 
us of our finitude of our temporariness that we are indeed like 
vapor that appears and then is gone 
these events teach us that there is no circumstances no 
situation regardless of how hopeless that cannot in the grace of 
god be transformed into a window for the spirit whereby we see 
reality more clearly 
suffering and awareness of others suffering sharpens our 
perceptions of life 
he said aids victims can find grace for themselves and others in 
their plight through realizing their acceptance by god 
in a sense they can take what is loathsome ordinary and 
deadly and transform it into a window that allows us to see beyond 
the ordinariness threatening us all he said 
he said it models in a small way what jesus did in the 
resurrection after his crucifixion transcending hopelessness the 
sentence that is against them and opening a changed perspective 
of life forever 
interspersed among the bible passages offered for aids sufferers 
are brief commentaries stressing gods constant devotion to the 
rejected and weak and forgiving compassion for human failure such 
as 
from psalm 103 as for us our life is like grass we grow and 
flourish like a wild flower then the wind blows on it and it is 
gone but for those who honor the lord his love lasts forever 
from 2 corinthians 4 even though our physicial being is 
gradually decaying yet our spiritual being is renewed day by day 
from 1 corinthians 15 listen to this secret truth when 
the last trumpet sounds we shall all be changed in an instant as 
quickly as the blinking of an eye for what is mortal must be 
changed into what is immortal

president reagan in a message for observance 
of national bible week nov 2027 says the bible is the most 
precious treasure yet entrusted to man

reagan and his wife nancy are honorary national chairpersons of 
the week an interfaith project emphasizing importance of the bible 
and promoting greater reading of it including daily passages 
recommended for the week 
reagan says the bible shaped the ideas and formed the 
consciences of many early americans and nurtured a profound 
belief in human dignity in individual freedom and in the 
inalienable rights of man 
unless we insure that the wonderful treasures of the bible 
are handed down to each new generation we cannot i believe long

three wild turkeys wandered into a 
residential neighborhood for a looksee and apparently decided to 
settle in abandoning their creekside roosts for utility poles and 
front porches in this little nebraska town 
townspeople say the birds seek out human companionship they 
commonly chase joggers and walkers and greet youngsters as they walk 
to school 
ruby ebsen says they visit her house every day 
i think they are looking to see if i will come out and give 
them some corn she said if i dont they go on 
last july eight or nine turkeys began forays into this town of 
2500 people on the nebraskakansas border the birds came from a 
wooded area along a creek that bounds superior on the west but the 
three who stayed have taken to spending their nights atop utility 
poles and their days on porches or cars 
they have really made themselves at home lorraine rempe 
said they sit on top of our house or on the patio rail 
if they see you in the yard they come right up and one seems 
to be the spokesman he gobbles first 
the gobblers have been content to stay within city limits a 
smart thing to do during turkey hunting season which ended veterans 
day but two weeks ago one of the birds was wounded with a pellet 
gun police are investigating because its illegal to shoot pellet 
or bb guns in town the wounded turkey is recovering at the home of 
a local dentist who raises guinea fowl and other birds

when joe doherty broke out of a maximum 
security prison in northern ireland seven years ago the irish 
republican armys underground network of safehouses and sympathizers 
led him to this working class irishamerican suburb of new york 
doherty had been convicted with three others of killing a british 
army officer in a 1980 shootout 
in kearny he lived with an american girlfriend worked in 
construction and took a parttime job at clancys bar in manhattan 
it was sort of like being normal for once having a job and 
knowing youre not going to get assassinated or stopped in the 
streets because of your religion doherty said in a recent 
interview at the metropolitan correctional center in manhattan 
on june 28 1983 a group of fbi agents walked into clancys 
ordered a round of beers and took him into custody again 
since then the case has grown to involve the the white house 
the justice department civil rights activists and the leaders of 
great britain and ireland 
doherty doesnt deny being involved in the killing but says it 
was a political act and that he warrants political asylum in the 
united states 
the government disagrees the justice department calls doherty a 
terrorist and says he should be deported to britain 
the question of who gets political asylum and who is a refugee 
should be based on the law on facts and on circumstances said 
mary pike dohertys lawyer but the question really depends on 
which government youre fleeing if its a government with which the 
reagan administration wants to remain friendly then you cant get 
asylum 
if i was a cuban said doherty theres no way i would be 
deported 
doherty a bachelor has spent the better part of his 33 years in 
hiding or in prison he joined the ira in 1969 after the british 
army crushed a catholic civil rights march on what has become known 
as bloody sunday 
id watched my father live his life as a secondclass citizen 
and tell me to learn a trade and then emigrate said doherty i 
didnt want to tell my son at 17 that he had to go to canada to find 
a job because of his religion 
while lawyers debate his case doherty has spent the past five 
years in a 12footby6foot cell at the federal prison in new york 
i see this case as a complete rejection of the constitution by 
the government said paul odwyer a civil rights attorney in new 
york there is no other prisoner i know of who has been held for 
such a protracted period of time having committed no crime in the 
united states 
tom moseley a former justice department attorney who handled the 
doherty case said the bottom line is that doherty is a terrorist 
who killed someone 
we felt he should have been extradited to the uk on the 
grounds of murder and assault said moseley now in private 
practice in morristown 
some who sympathize with the iras goal of uniting the republic 
of ireland with the northern six counties that make up the british 
province of northern ireland consider doherty a folk hero 
the justice department went to court last year to stop 
philadelphians from naming doherty honorary grand marshal of their 
st patricks day parade 
free joe doherty graffiti adorns walls and sidewalks all over 
new york city at a new jersey bar not far from where doherty lived 
his picture hangs alongside that of bobby sands the ira prisoner 
who starved to death during a 1981 hunger strike at a british prison 
among dohertys supporters are new yorks roman catholic 
archbishop cardinal john oconnor amnesty international the 
american civil liberties union and the rev jesse jackson who 
visited doherty in prison in july 
but there also are influential forces fighting for dohertys 
extradition 
british prime minister margaret thatcher raised the case in talks 
with president reagan during a 1986 visit to washington 
sen richard lugar rind described the jailed ira man as an 
irish ghengis khan lugar led a successful fight to exclude the 
political exception clause from the centuryold usbritish 
extradition treaty when it was renegotiated in 1986 
the british government filed a formal request for dohertys 
extradition in 1983 it was denied in december 1984 by us district 
judge john e sprizzo in brooklyn who ruled that dohertys crime 
was a political act and qualified the defendant for political asylum 
the government appealed and us district judge charles s haight 
decided in dohertys favor a government appeal to the us court of 
appeals in new york upheld dohertys previous victories 
having failed to extradite doherty the justice department began 
deportation proceedings 
since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent 
doherty chose the independent republic of ireland and his decision 
was upheld by immigration judge howard i cohen in 1986 
if i was sent back to ireland i would be arrested and put in 
jail doherty said but hopefully it would be a humane place and 
i would get a fair hearing not like in the north 
the administration this time through the immigration and 
naturalization service appealed cohens order and again lost 
another appeal and another government defeat followed 
meanwhile the republic of ireland under pressure from london 
and washington in december 1987 ratified the european convention on 
terrorism which calls for mandatory extradition of those deemed 
terrorists that eliminated dohertys irish option 
today doherty is pinning his hopes on winning asylum though 
after 5 years of court battles he isnt too optimistic about his 
chances for freedom 
i go to court i win he says but here i am

coonskin caps and flubber may make comebacks 
as nbc revives davy crockett and the absentminded professor 
for a new round of shows from walt disney productions 
the two shows will be part of a wheel of rotating series 
specials and classics from the disney library on nbcs sunday night 
the magic world of disney 
davy crockett makes its debut sunday with a twohour movie of 
new adventures of the popular frontiersman tim dunigan dons the 
coonskin cap to star as the king of the wild frontier johnny 
cash plays crockett as an elder statesman 
the following sunday harry anderson of nbcs night court 
stars as professor henry crawford the forgetful inventor of 
lighterthanair flubber in a onehour episode of the 
absentminded professor based on the two movie comedies from the 
early 1960s starring fred macmurray 
those two shows will appear regularly and were looking for a 
third actionadventure said executive producer william blinn who 
wrote the davy crockett movie 
although the third rotating element hasnt been decided one 
possibility going into production in january is mountain man a 
contemporary adventure similar to the popular crocodile dundee 
movies it has not yet been cast 
in mountain man a trapper who has spent most of his life 
away from civilization inherits a bigcity newspaper and fortune 
davy crockett as a television series was a sensation on abcs 
disneyland in 195455 disneyland was the sixth 
highestrated show that sason and it wasnt long before kids 
everywhere were sporting coonskin caps and singing its popular theme 
song the ballad of davy crockett davy daaavy crockett 
king of the wild frontier 
fess parker played crockett buddy ebsen was his sidekick george 
russell disney filmed three episodes making the mistake in the 
last of killing off crockett at the alamo crockett was brought back 
to life by popular demand and several more episodes were made 
davy crockett was actually televisions first miniseries in 
subsequent years disney aired such miniseries as the saga of andy 
burnett the nine lives of elfego baca and texas john 
slaughter 
in the current storyline crockett fights in the creek indian 
wars in alabama the ballad of davy crockett will be sung in the 
new shows but only briefly and gary grubbs plays the role of 
george russell 
we brought back davy crockett because the character is warm 
likable and adventurous said blinn he was a peculiar 
combination of raconteur and adventurer to some degree he was a 
charlatan i suppose 
but in the 30 years since the first shows weve become much 
more aware of ourselves crockett will make mistakes hell have a 
broader vision and hell have a more responsible attitude toward 
minorities were not giving him 1988 sensibilities but he will 
have a greater appreciation of gray areas and ambiguities 
blinn said one of the difficulties of the new show is keeping the 
wholesomeness of the walt disney name but making it more 
contemporary in attitude 
were going up against 21 jump street a show that deals with 
teenage sexuality abortion and drug pushers he said if 
thats being offered on another channel we cant confine ourselves 
to gee theyre tearing down the soda fountain dad

before the end of 1988 gets much closer 
financial advisers say its a good idea to check on whether you 
have been paying the right amount of federal income tax 
that advice holds not only for people with large incomes and 
complicated investments but for everyday wageearners who havent 
checked lately on the progress of their income and withholding taxes 
the idea is simply to determine whether you have paid too much or 
too little so far toward the eventual bottom line on the tax return 
that will be due april 15 
if the answer is too little you may be in danger of incurring 
interest charges and penalties from the internal revenue service 
if the answer is too much you may want to consider asking your 
employer to reduce your withholding tax for the last few paychecks 
of the year 
less withholding now will reduce the size of the refund you stand 
to collect next spring that may not appeal much to people who use 
overwithholding as a type of forced savings plan 
but if you are going to be due the money a few months from now 
why not collect it sooner and put it to work for you rather than 
leaving it on deposit with uncle sam at no interest 
perhaps the extra takehome money in december might help you to 
pay for holiday gifts and activities without having to borrow at 
high creditcard interest rates 
the exercise of calculating the status of your tax payments does 
not have to be especially complicated but experts on the subject 
say it needs to be done with care to avoid a misstep 
many people can start with their most recent pay stub which 
should give them a pretty good idea of what their total wages and 
salaries will be for the year 
if your other income and deductions such as investment interest 
received and mortgage interest paid has not changed drastically 
since last year you can use the numbers on your 1987 return as a 
basis for estimating what your 1988 taxable income will be 
remembering that some deductions such as for consumer interest 
expense will be less generous for 1988 
then you can compute your projected 1988 tax liability using the 
tax tables for the year which may be available from your employer 
a financial institution where you do business or your local library 
if it looks as though your withholding is going to fall short by 
a significant amount further action may be warranted 
to avoid penalties and interest the rules require that your 
withholding and any quarterly estimated or other advance payments 
satisfy one of two standards 
it must equal either 100 percent of what you owed for 1987 or 90 
percent of the total that will be due for 1988 
suppose you had a windfall this year substantially increasing 
your taxable income and you find that you are not likely to satisfy 
either of those tests 
if youre able to adjust withholding you can solve the 
problem says william brennan an adviser on investment and tax 
planning with the accounting firm of ernst amp whinney 
just arrange with your employer to withhold the amount needed 
to catch up withholding is deemed to have been paid in evenly 
throughout the year no matter when its actually withheld 
in this way you may be able to avoid interest and penalties 
entirely 
another way to close the gap step up you deductible activities 
such as charitable contributions to reduce the amount of income 
that will be subject to tax

nobody in recent years has been able to 
demonstrate that taxes are fair the claim is made every time the 
tax laws are changed in fact but the proof isnt provided 
is it right for example to impose big tax burdens on young 
singles who have few items to deduct should corporate dividends be 
taxed twice as they are do homeowners really deserve the tax 
shelter they have 
almost anyone can compile a list of inequities in the tax 
laws they write to congress and congress then rearranges the tax 
laws it has done so every year of this decade closing loopholes 
opening others 
and next year if presidentelect george bush follows through on 
campaign indications congress may be asked to deal with an aspect 
of the tax law that many people consider to be not just inequitable 
but just plain foolish 
it is the tax on income that never was made on buying power that 
never existed on funds that the person taxed never had the use of 
it is the capital gains tax which as it exists taxes a person for 
inflation 
for example assume an investment of 5000 in stocks has been 
held seven years if the appreciation averaged 10 percent over that 
time you will have approximately doubled your money your capital 
gains would be 5000 your tax about 1400 
while you might appear to have earned 10 percent in current 
dollars you really would have earned only 6 percent a year why 
because the value of the dollar changed inflation probably eroded 4 
percent a year 
at 6 percent a year your money will not double in seven years it 
will grow only to around 7000 nevertheless you will pay capital 
gains taxes as if it had grown to 10000 you will pay 1400 in 
taxes 
deducting the taxes from the inflationadjusted total amount 
earned will leave you with just 5600 an average gain of 100 a 
year or less for having invested your savings in the american 
economy 
as the law exists capital gains which are longterm gains and 
thus vulnerable to inflation are taxed at the same 28 percent rate 
as ordinary income which suffers relatively little from inflation 
it is for reasons such as this that bush mentioned the 
possibility of pushing back the capital gains tax rate which was 
raised in the 1986 tax reform measure but there is more to it than 
the inequity 
the repercussions of the current level of capital gains shows up 
every day in the securities markets where individual investors 
refrain from buying stocks and opt instead for the lower risk of 
interestbearing bonds 
paying taxes on money never earned isnt restricted to the 
securities markets in fact the most common abuse of common sense 
occurs in the taxing of capital gains earned on the inflated 
value of personal residences 
in this latter instance however homeowners are accorded various 
tax benefits that offset some of the damage in most other 
investments however there is no relief 
in such investments the investor simply pays taxes on income 
that was never made

the older television grows the more juvenile it 
becomes 
delirious in a factbased fever tv sets are boiling over with 
playground pranks and true detective docudramas from geraldo 
riveras scuffle with wannabe nazis to the slowmo misdeeds on 
americas most wanted television has rarely been so revolting 
and so riveting at the same time 
the new splurge of reality programming has critics shaking their 
heads and viewers crowding living room sofas and as long as the 
ratings soar a whole lot more truthisstrangerthanfiction series 
will be hurtling your way 
which is why reality champion fox broadcasting co is riding high 
i do think were on to something said barry diller foxs 
chairman and chief executive officer the reporters is not a 
carbon copy of anything else and i think americas most 
wanted is an honestly moving show 
in fact these shows owe a lot to previous programs the 
reporters can be seen as merely 60 minutes on a caffeine jag 
the crime shows as simply borrowing from the headlines more directly 
than did hill street blues or st elsewhere 
imitators are lining up nbc has added unsolved mysteries to 
its schedule cbs started high risk and abc has resurrected 
thats incredible and added the trilogy of scandals 
crimes of the century and trackdown 
meanwhile television syndicators are pounding the pavement for 
on trial group one medical tabloid exclusive 
crimewatch tonight crime diaries reward and inside 
edition 
the popularity springs from a cast of characters more varied and 
bizarre than any sitcom 
in one corner are the hyperactive talkshow hosts rivera with 
his broken nose and the clusterbomb of phil donahue oprah winfrey 
and sally jessy raphael with all of their needling queries these 
four ask the questions we only dream about posing 
the other corner is filled with the marginally less egotistical 
journalists who would recreate the john kennedy assassination if 
there were a rating point in it 
led by maury povich on foxs syndicated a current affair and 
its rape and murder replay show americas most wanted the key 
here is to sit the audience down next to the corpse smack in the 
middle of the crime scene 
wherever reality programs fail in subtlety and substance they 
click in thrills and ratings costing a fraction of traditional 
comedies and dramas these unpredictable programs have in some 
instances doubled foxs audience share 15 percent of the nations 
sets tune in americas most wanted 
overall the audience is clearly substantial rivera nose broken 
but selfimportance intact is soaring from publicity generated from 
his talkshow brawl and his nbc hit devil worship exposing 
satans underground 
rivera the carnival barker of television journalism even went 
so far as to slap a promotional teaser on the slugfest edition of 
geraldo parents be advised that the language and violence 
contained makes this show inappropriate for small children in 
other words kids watch this 
why are audiences lapping it up 
american television viewers are tired of watching the most 
inoffensive programming said kevin wendle executive vice 
president of foxs entertainment division they have said we 
dont want another network give us something different and were 
pulling out all the stops 
and how mixing sometimes sensational celebrity gossip and lurid 
crime stories with firstperson journalism the reporters 
doesnt just penetrate the fourth wall it runs through it into 
your home 
future fox shows may be even more personal among ideas in the 
hopper for foxs third night of programming planned for mondays 
sometime next year is cops a graphic documentary series about 
a group of florida police officers making arrests and handling dead 
bodies 
another fox program in development will try to build on detective 
magazines with private eyes talking up their most interesting cases 
with the help of video recreations 
they fox have shown that theres an insatiable thirst for 
real life among the television viewing audience said rivera 
they are filling a void that the networks are leaving i think 
that americas most wanted has really hit a nerve its populist 
tv at its most pragmatic 
so much flotsam clogs the reality genre that some players are now 
trying to rise above it all 
nick clooney host of the courtroom highlight show on trial 
recently sent reporters a letter saying by some unimaginable 
stretch of probabilities a few writers equate such programs as 
geraldo and morton downey jr with on trial nothing could be 
further from the truth the letter was mailed one day after an 
on trial publicist asked that the show be included in any 
upcoming stories on tabloid television 
as with most anything else too much of a good thing can be 
risky if the realitybased programming crumples overnight so too 
might fox 
while its great now well be careful diller said if 
were not very careful about the diet well make terrible 
mistakes

anna ido thamos waves a limp cloverlike weed 
in one hand and with the other displays sorghum mash residue from a 
local beer factory 
often boiled weeds and sorghum mash are all she has to feed 
herself and her seven children some days they do not eat at all 
it is miserable the 36yearold nurse said as the tropical 
dusk fell over several hundred people waiting to receive grain at a 
food distribution center in this provincial capital beseiged by 
rebels fighting sudans government 
the grain is part of 1500 metric tons of food being airlifted 
into juba in an emergency united nations operation from entebbe 
uganda and a norwegian church aid airlift of 150 metric tons from 
nairobi kenya it is the first food to juba since september when 
the remnants of a truck convoy carrying relief food from uganda 
limped into town following a rebel attack that killed 15 people 
mostly kenyan drivers and assistants 
the airlifts may be the last chance of survival for the people 
here in southern sudan caught up in the conflict between the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army led by john garang and the 
government 750 miles north in khartoum say local government 
church and relief officials 
garang is a southerner and the people here are southerners so 
the central government is not interested they want everyone to die 
of hunger charged francis luate deputy director of information 
for equatoria province 
however rebel activity has made the lush foodproducing 
countryside uninhabitable forcing people into juba where the 
displaced and the townspeople alike now must rely on international 
aid 
the rebels claim to be fighting to liberate the people yet 
they are committing atrocities raping and killing luate claimed 
the rebels took up arms against the moslemdominated government 
in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and economic reforms for the 
predominantly christian and animist south and the lifting of the 
countrys islamic laws in the area 
roman catholic archbishop paulino lukudo loro accuses the 
government of deliberately withholding food aid in an effort to 
depopulate the south and rob the rebels of their base of support 
this is a clear plan of extermination of the south said 
loro it is really genocide going on 
loro points to the governments ability to continue airlifting 
arms and ammunition to its soldiers in juba 
why is it not using military planes to bring food here 
the situation is worse in torit 50 miles east of juba where the 
army recently made five airdrops of food and supplies to troops but 
nothing to the people according to a radio message from the towns 
relief committee 
the committee urgently requested an airdrop for the 4000 people 
living in the besieged town 
the civilians are left to eating only leaves and waiting to be 
buried it said in message to the norwegian church aid office in 
juba 
both rebels and government soldiers have placed landmines on the 
footpaths and roads around the besieged towns cutting off the 
regions lush green fields where crops remain unharvested 
small stocks of vegetables are available in jubas markets but 
they are insufficient for the towns population which has swelled 
from 150000 to more than 200000 with people from the embattled 
southern countryside who fled to camps on jubas outskirts 
predominantly arab merchants continue to get supplies on 
governmentchartered flights from khartoum but sell food at prices 
well beyond the means of most before the airlift began for 
example a 12pound bag of maize corn was selling for the sudanese 
pound equivalent of 340 
however the grain being airlifted is not enough said sam kenyi 
head of the combined agencies relief team a consortium of relief 
agencies and churches in juba the emergency operation allows the 
estimated 50000 refugees in the camps around juba each 200 grams 
seven ounces of maize a day a third of the relief grain has been 
allotted to cooperatives in town where wageearners like ms thamos 
can buy up to eight pounds at most once a week 
death rates have been rising since september with as many as 400 
hungerweakened people mostly children dying each month in the 
towns two hospitals said dr oliver duku project leader of 
african medical and research foundation and us agency for 
international development 
nobody is sure of the countrywide death toll since the fighting 
began but foreign relief officials in khartoum and equatorias 
episcopal archbishop benjamin yugusuk estimate at least 250000 
people have died of starvation or inadequate medical care since late 
last year 
about 2 million people a third of the souths population have 
been turned into refugees by the fighting about 13 million of whom 
were forced from their homes this year they say

maitre d for a pack of his favorite brand pungent french gauloises 
he sounded like the matinee idol he has played and parodied 
onscreen and was in the proper mockebullient spirits to promote 
his new movie high spirits which opened last week in the 
united states 
i love playing people who have got relish to life a firm 
identity in not being part of the herd said the actor whose 
character peter plunkett furthers a lineup of otoole eccentrics 
ranging from lawrence of arabia to the schizoid earl of gurney in 
the ruling class 
high spirits casts otoole as an heir who inherits a 
decaying haunted irish castle daryl hannah splash plays the 
castles comeliest ghost and steve guttenberg cocoon and liam 
neeson the good father head the supporting cast the movie is 
directed by the irish filmmaker neil jordan who made the lowbudget 
hits mona lisa and the company of wolves 
equipped with his cigarettes and an alcoholfree bloody mary the 
actor settled down to a salmon trout the vegetables went untouched 
at 56 he remains as gaunt and chiselfaced as when he shot to 
international stardom in 1962 as te lawrence the mysterious 
english desert warrior in david leans brilliant academy 
awardwinning epic lawrence of arabia 
otoole said high spirits marked a welcome change from the 
demands of his most recent screen role as tutor to the emperor puyi 
in bernardo bertoluccis oscarwinning the last emperor it was 
a cameo role that nevertheless stole the moment as otoole always 
manages to do 
ones always looking for something different from what one did 
the last time and if a funny role comes up its very nice to do 
he said having just played classic otoole in china which was 
not exactly a bundle of laughs along came this rather potty film 
there was a gentleness i rather liked a sweetness an amiability 
he described plunkett as a downatheel aristocrat someone 
who absurdly is hanging on to this enormous pile of stone at all 
sorts of costs 
plunkett is the latest in a versatile career that has seen seven 
oscar nominations for performances ranging from henry ii opposite 
katharine hepburns eleanor of aquitaine in the lion in winter 
1968 to the enigmatic film director eli cross in the stunt man 
1978 and the hilariously selfabsorbed actor alan swann in my 
favorite year 1982 
however the actor reserves special affection for lawrence of 
arabia the movie will be rereleased shortly with 20 minutes of 
lost footage restored an act of reclamation that pleases its star 
its a magnificent film part of film history said otoole 
who worked with the celebrated lean and the screenwriter robert bolt 
to facilitate the restoration when sam spiegel the original 
producer died david went truffling hunting and found 20 minutes 
that had disappeared without any rhyme reason or symmetry 
it will now be more than four hours long and otoole is 
delighted to go back to the epic vision is splendid that was 
what was great fun about last emperor 
irishborn and englishbred otoole followed the same theatrical 
apprenticeship as others of his generation who made it in hollywood 
such as albert finney the late richard burton and alan bates 
his long stage career includes playing hamlet at the opening of 
the national theater in 1963 and doing a macbeth in 1980 that was 
so reviled by critics that it played to packed curiosityseeking 
audiences at the old vic 
he left his broadway debut until last year when he played 
professor higgins in george bernard shaws pygmalion he and val 
mays production received mixed marks but he likes new yorks 
attitude to gbs his hero 
it was such a relief to go to a country where he was 
respected otoole said they audiences saw the humor and the 
situations coming around the corner so it was like a breath of 
great fresh air 
otoole rarely gives interviews and he laments the british 
press fascination with his private life his lengthy victorious 
battle against booze and his bitter custody dispute over his 
5yearold son lorcan which is irish for lawrence 
its lazy copy he said wearily the press got a few good 
stories in the 50s and 60s and they keep it going it seems i 
dont change but the copy does 
having finished lunch otoole looked at his watch and hurriedly 
picked up a folder of papers from the floor 
ive got to float he said 
and with that the lanky star was gone

david crosby stops talking in the middle of a 
rapidfire sentence and sets his eyes on a bothersome fly buzzing 
about in the living room of his san fernando valley home 
he takes his hand from his portly stomach and moves toward the 
fly which bounces off the plate glass window inches behind him 
smack silence 
a few years ago crosby a member of the rock groups the byrds 
and crosby stills nash and young in the 1960s and 70s would not 
have cared if the fly had crawled all over him as long as it didnt 
disturb his drug stash 
its like being on a greased bannister that turns into a razor 
blade he said of his 20year addiction in a recent interview 
you are going to die it was just the most horrifying experience 
of my whole life 
crosby 47 has remained clean for more than two years after a 
stint in a texas prison the story of his addiction arrests 
imprisonment and recovery with girlfriend and now wife jan dance 
will be told in the doubleday book long time gone written with 
crosbys friend writerdirector carl gottlieb 
we didnt just use people saying nice stuff about me we used 
adversary interviews with people crosby said 
crosby also reteamed with stephen stills graham nash and neil 
young for american dream on atlantic records the first album 
since 1970s deja vu to feature all four 
if there was any criticism you could level at deja vu it 
would be that it seemed we added neil young to some crosby stills 
and nash and some crosby stills and nash to some neil young he 
said this time neil was an integral part of it from start to 
finish and it came out much more like an organic whole 
crosby said the group has kept its fussiness intact over the 
years with the album mixed and finished more than once crosbys 
solo album on aampm records is due this winter 
the byrds and crosby stills nash and young both blended the 
sounds of country folk and rock along with political consciousness 
and harmonious vocals 
the byrds version of turn turn turn and bob dylans mr 
tambourine man became standards featuring crosbys high voiced 
harmonies from collaborations with stills nash and young came 
teach your children woodstock and suite judy blue eyes 
with his trademark green cape and enticing good looks cosby was 
a sunset strip sultan as he made the club rounds in the 60s with 
his entourage and lots of drugs 
at first it was just a little snort a little puff you know 
but i had a ton of money whatever ive done ive done to excess 
so i did it to excess and it absolutely started to put me away 
crosby said 
but by the early 80s his body had swollen through years of drug 
abuse and his face grew ruddy and scabbed 
i used to have toxic seizures from the saturation of cocaine 
he said this happened to me at the wheel of a car on the san 
diego freeway i took out a hundred yards of crash fence i could 
have killed myself or i could have killed other people 
he was oblivious to the ripe odor of the junkie life he shared 
with dance and the pleadings of friends such as nash jackson 
browne and paul kantner of the jefferson airplane 
i did let everybody down i did get so completely out of it 
that even the people who loved me the most had to back off and say 
i cant watch this 
crosbys mill valley calif home became a fortress where 
gunshots flared at phantom intruders his talismans were cocaine 
and a pipe and torch used in freebasing he also carried a 
45caliber automatic pistol 
those terrible charms were with him on april 13 1982 when 
dallas police found him sitting crosslegged on the dressingroom 
floor of a nightclub sucking cocaine vapors crosby was there to 
perform score some quick cash and add it to the millions of dollars 
he estimates he smoked snorted or gave away to predatory hangerson 
over the years the bust was one of several in the 80s on drug 
weapon and other misdemeanor violations for crosby 
he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison but the 
conviction was overturned crosby was free on an appeal bond but 
kept violating its terms with more arrests and fleeing courtordered 
drug treatment programs six times 
he spent two months in dallas county jail was freed then in 
december 1985 he surrendered to authorities in west palm beach 
fla rather than follow through with a plan to flee the country 
with dance on a boat he owned 
he was denied a release and spent three months in the dallas 
county jail and five months in the huntsville texas prison 
huntsville has a terrible reputation its one of the worst 
prison systems in the world said crosby who was not separated 
from prison population and worked in the institutions mattress 
factory i was hanging out with murderers and every kind of 
criminal there is i saw guys beaten to a pulp i mean a bloody 
wreck right in front of me 
but thats where i woke up so i have this weird paradoxical 
relationship with it yes it was awful and at the same time its 
the place where my life took a turn an enormous turn for the 
better 
crosby was paroled in august 1986 and allowed to move back to 
california where he began tying loose ends together dance also had 
shaken her addiction while crosby was imprisoned 
jan went through the whole thing with me crosby said a 
lot of people tried to make her out as the fly in the ointment but 
the truth is i turned her on to freebase they tried to carve her 
out of my life every which way 
they were married in may 1987 and last june the us supreme 
court upheld the reversal of crosbys texas arrest on the grounds of 
illegal search and seizure 
david anderle was head of aampm records artists and repertoire 
section when he got a call a year ago from crosby 
i was excited anderle recalled and i was a bit 
apprehensive i was nervous that it wouldnt be there anymore and i 
would have to be the one to tell him but i think his voice is 
sweeter now than i remember it there is another added dimension of 
his voice from growing older 
i was dying crosby said and i just reached out by the 
fingertips so close so close

they call it the castle a 
massive stone building with eight wings radiating from a central 
sixstory rotunda 
the wings hold eight tiers of cells stacked one upon the other 
and in each 8by10foot cell an inmate is allowed a cot a table 
and a chair 
the us disciplinary barracks in fort leavenworth is the biggest 
military prison in the nation it is a grim home for about 1450 
inmates sent here from bases all over the world wherever american 
military men and women are stationed 
fortytwo officers including one lieutenant colonel and 21 
women are serving time here among them are drug dealers armed 
robbers rapists murderers and spies more than 80 are serving life 
terms three inmates are on death row 
and there is strict military discipline 
our rules are so strict that if a guy turns left and he knows 
hes not supposed to turn left hes in trouble said lt col 
gerald m gasko prison chief of staff 
you earn what you get here added the prison commandant col 
larry berrong a former army airborne ranger and vietnam veteran 
there arent any free lunches 
military officials say the goal of the prison is not just 
confinement but correction 
unfortunately in the united states today we do a lot of 
confining and not much correction gasko said we attempt to 
give them tools so when they leave here they can be productive 
citizens 
when inmates leave these walls they return to civilian life not 
to the military 
next to discipline training is the top priority at the fort 
leavenworth prison which has more than 20 vocational programs 
including automotive repairs printing carpentry upholstery and 
hotel and restaurant management 
inmates whom officials would not allow to be interviewed even 
repair cars and furniture of military families living at fort 
leavenworth 
officials claim the disciplinary barracks has the oldest shoe 
repair business west of the mississippi river started in 1877 to 
make boots for cavalrymen 
now it repairs everything from prescription orthopedic shoes to 
cleated golf shoes gasko said 
the prison also has one of the largest silkscreening businesses 
in the nation providing all the decals for us air force planes 
congress authorized the prisons construction in 1874 an old 
quartermaster depot that had supplied military posts in the indian 
territory housed the first prisoners the castle was completed in 
1915 by inmate labor 
inmate labor is still used for maintenance but the prisoners 
also work with their minds most have high school diplomas and 
those who dont go straight into the classroom when they arrive 
gasko said 
they can earn associate and bachelors degrees through 
correspondence and a few are working on masters degrees but gasko 
said they do that at their own expense 
the prison takes enlisted men from all branches of the service 
except the us navy it takes all convicted officers regardless of 
the length of the sentence 
gasko said the shortest sentence for an officer he recalls is 
seven days i think they wanted him to see the inside of a 
prison he said 
one inmate is going into his 17th year he added 
some famous inmates have seen the inside of its walls from lt 
william calley who was convicted of murdering vietnamese civilians 
at my lai to clayton lonetree the us marine who was convicted of 
espionage while an embassy guard in moscow 
three inmates are awaiting death sentence although the army has 
not executed anyone since 1961 and no execution dates have been set 
they are 
ronald gray 22 of liberty city fla who was sentenced last 
april in connection with the death of two women he was stationed at 
fort bragg nc 
james murphy 24 of clinton nc who was convicted last year 
of murdering his wife his 6yearold stepson and his 2yearold 
son while stationed in nanau germany with the army 
ronnie curtis 22 a marine from wichita kan who was 
convicted in august 1987 of murdering his platoon commander and 
platoon commanders wife at camp lejeune 
although most inmates are firsttime offenders the average 
sentence is about 10 years about twothirds are serving time for 
such crimes as assault rape murder or kidnapping 17 percent are 
imprisoned for narcotics violations and 11 percent were sentenced 
for theft no inmate is serving time for just a military offense 
such as being absent without leave 
some prisoners work outside the walls and in nearby leavenworth 
on workrelease programs about 20 inmates work on the 2600acre 
prison farm which raises hogs and cattle and grows row crops and 
vegetables 
outside the castle walls inmates who are installation 
parolees stay in an unsecure barracks they have proved 
themeselves reliable while doing their time and have earned a few 
extra privleges 
the only thing that keeps them out there is moral restraint 
gasko said but the rules are extremely tough and we dont 
tolerate any violations

when yves saint laurent took a bow to thunderous 
applause after his 1988 winter couture collection a lot of the 
credit went to an unsung hero of couture francois lesage 
fabulous like wind through the vines saint laurent told 
lesage the 59yearold master embroiderer whose workshop had 
produced the sparkly grape bunches and leaves on satin jackets that 
nearly brought down the house 
fashionwatchers still remember the chessgame jackets at 
chanel and the scherrer landscape scenes on clothes as 
produced by lesage who also turns out stunning designs for 
givenchy lacroix and dior 
lesage has won the medal of the city of paris and other awards 
but he is rarely mentioned on a fashion program 
maybe we really are unsung heroes he said in an interview 
lesage is guru and executive for 120 highly skilled employees 
depending on them to turn out coutures most striking embroidery for 
many competing designers 
you see how painstaking it is lesage said strolling through 
the rabbit warren of rooms that serve as his workshop near the 
opera the young women bent over their embroidery frames looked 
relaxed although deep in their concentration 
a fully beaded dress can take several women in the workshop up 
to 1800 hours from sketch to last sequin said lesage 
this gorgeous glitz doesnt come cheap 
maybe 100000 for a totally beaded dress said lesage but 
some things you cant quibble over its like asking the price of a 
custommade car 
in 1924 his father and mother alfred and louise lesage bought 
the business from paris top embroiderer michonet that was in the 
heyday of the early days of couture when the beaded flapper reigned 
i grew up in these rooms the son said in fact i still 
spend 10 hours a day here and my wife and children complain 
alfred lesages only major gaffe was when he experimented with 
some new gelatin beads he was awakened one night by an irate 
customer whose dress had melted at the opera leaving her in a sea 
of bouillon 
work for schiaparelli put lesage in the limelight as 
schiaparellis clothes were more memorable for the fanciful 
astrology circus and other embroidery themes than for the actual 
styles 
world war ii threw a damper on things but in 1948 young 
francois sailed to new york to sell the lesage embroidery he ended 
up working with edith head and other film designers hiring hispanic 
women to do the embroidery 
he met stars like lana turner and marlene dietrich and found 
hollywood glamorous rather than vulgar as others he knew had 
perceived it 
on the contrary the ziegfeld follies for instance have 
influenced some of our top french designers he said 
when his father died in 1950 francois lesage came home to take 
over the leading executive role he knows how each job is done and 
expects perfection 
it begins with a sketch he said showing how a worker uses 
an electric needle to pierce tiny holes along the sketching lines 
colored powder is pumped through the holes onto the fabric in a 
stencil process then the endless threads of beads are chosen and 
dyed if necessary to get the right color nuances 
embroidering is done by hand painstakingly attaching the threads 
of beads or sequins to the fabric with a hooked needle 
most of the highly skilled workers are women although the head 
designer is a man 
he lives here in the frantic weeks before the couture 
showings said lesage we have a dormitory 
wandering through the storerooms lesage pointed out his treasure 
trove of beads sequins rhinestones cabochon stones and gold 
braid carefully packed in boxes 
i have 60 tons of goods he said enough to last 200 
years 
twice a year the workshop makes up samples as suggestions to 
present to top couturiers although they often call on the telephone 
or send sketches of their own ideas 
he has to be tactful in dealing with designers in a trade known 
for jealousy and petty spats he tries to accommodate all their 
wishes 
saint laurent once rang up from morocco and wanted mice 
rodents he got and they looked like pets rather than pests on saint 
laurents satin evening coats and jackets 
lesage feels his business is enjoying a boom largely because of 
the money designers can spend on luxurious details like embroidery 
in a couture collection 
the houses earn a great deal of money through their licenses 
putting their name on accessories and they can increase their fame 
by publicity they get from fabulous couture clothes thus selling 
more of the licensed goods he said 
while just a few women buy these expensive embroidered clothes 
the designers will still make them just as part of the show to 
promote their vast readytowear and licensing lines 
those who cant afford a dazzling embroidered couture gown can 
buy a fanciful pin belt or bag by lesage at his shop next to the 
ritz in paris or in a few american outlets 
but these arent baubles for bargainhunters either earrings 
start at around 100 the most expensive embroidered handbag with 
beaded fruit motifs costs 4000

the us dollar drifted lower in europe today after 
us trade figures for september showed a drop in the merchandise 
trade deficit that was not big enough to reverse the currencys 
steady decline 
these figures are a little bit better than was expected said 
richard jeffrey a senior economist for brokers hoare govett 
however i think the longerterm picture is still the same 
that demand is still too strong in the us and that that is sucking 
in exports to too great an extent 
jeffrey told british broadcasting corp temporarily i think 
these figures will lift some of the downward pressure from the 
dollar and might stop interest rates going up in the very short 
term 
in the longer term however he said the us administration 
would have to sanction higher interest rates to constrain consumer 
demand 
volume was thin because west german markets were closed for a 
national holiday traders said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar rose 029 yen to a closing 12354 after the trade 
report the dollar was quoted in london at 12290 yen

acquisition specialist forstmann little amp co 
said today it has scrapped a plan to enter the bidding for rjr 
nabisco inc the foodtobacco giant targeted in the largestever 
corporate takeover attempt 
forstmann little said in a brief statement that an investment 
group headed by the firm had decided consistent with its 
investment criteria it will not submit a proposal 
its withdrawal from possible involvement in the battle for 
atlantabased rjr nabisco leaves two enormous contenders a group 
consisting of rjr nabisco management backed by the wall street 
firms shearson lehman hutton inc and salomon brothers inc vs the 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
both have offered more than 20 billion for rjr nabisco a maker 
of products ranging from oreo cookies to winston cigarettes most of 
that money would be borrowed and repaid via rjr nabiscos earnings 
and the sale of some of its assets an increasingly controversial 
transaction known as a leveraged buyout 
forstmann littles withdrawal came three weeks after it held 
talks with the rjr nabisco management group and considered joining 
their bid for the company it then assembled a rival group 
consisting of procter amp gamble co ralston purina co castle amp 
cooke inc and goldman sachs amp co 
the rjr nabisco management group stunned the financial world late 
last month by disclosing its intention to acquire the company in a 
leveraged buyout the size complexity and enormous debt load of 
such a transaction have raised concerns about the use of borrowed 
money to finance corporate takeovers

the nations merchandise trade deficit shrank 
nearly 2 billion to 105 billion in september as exports hit a 
record high the government said today 
the 15 percent improvement came from an august deficit revised 
upward from 1218 billion to 123 billion imports declined 
slightly in september from the record high 398 billion posted the 
previous month the commerce department said 
analysts had anticipated the narrowing of the us trade gap in 
september following a large widening in august in what has been a 
monthtomonth seesaw pattern most of this year 
many analysts however had hoped for a greater narrowing of the 
gap to prevent a new raid on the dollar which fell last week on 
currency markets over concerns about presidentelect george bushs 
ability to bring down the trade and budget deficits 
the dollar drifted lower on european and canadian foreign 
exchange markets in response to the trade report but trading was 
thin because west german markets were closed for a national holiday 
stock and bond prices on new york markets also edged lower in early 
trading 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said the new numbers 
show that the trade gap is continuing to narrow but added that the 
deficit is still too high 
continued strong progress will not be easy but it can be 
accomplished if we keep on the right course following 
nonprotectionist growthoriented trade policies yeutter said 
the alternative would cost american jobs without bringing a 
permanent reduction 
including the september figures the trade deficit the first nine 
months of this year is running at an annual rate of 1372 billion 
compared with a record 1703 billion last year and 1551 billion 
in 1986 
the 22 percent or 700 million september export increase to a 
record 282 billion was led almost entirely by higher sales of 
american autos data processing and office equipment and chemicals 
the commerce department said 
sales of us airplanes telephone equipment and electrical 
machinery abroad declined from august 
americans meanwhile bought 600 million less in manufactured 
goods including fewer apparel products and shoes plus less iron 
and steel and 400 million less oil from foreign producers in 
september 
altogether us imports dropped by 11 billion to 387 billion 
in september the government said but imports of foreign made autos 
and auto parts climbed by 8 percent to an 8 billion monthly high 
for the year 
oil imports fell from an average 79 million barrels per day in 
august to 75 million barrels a day in september the price also 
dropped an average 45 cents per barrel to 1460 the combination 
reduced the nations oil bill to foreign producers from 37 billion 
in august to 33 billion the following month 
as usual the united states suffered its biggest deficit with 
japan at 41 billion however the gap was 700 million less than 
it had been in august and was at its lowest since january 
the trade gap with western european countries also fell by more

grand metropolitan plc has threatened to lower 
its 523 billion takeover bid if pillsbury cos planned spinoff of 
its burger king corp unit occurs according to a published report 
wednesday 
attorneys for the british conglomerate told a delaware court that 
grand met would be required to make fundamental changes to its 
60ashare offer should the spinoff occur first the wall 
street journal reported 
among the changes would be a lower price to reflect a potential 
tax liability of several hundred million dollars the journal 
reported 
in addition since burger king would become a florida 
corporation grand met would have to mount additional legal attacks 
on floridas antitakeover laws should it still want to acquire the 
fastfood chain the journal quoted grand met attorneys as saying 
pillsburys stock closed at 58 tuesday down 625 cents in 
composite new york stock exchange trading 
the spinoff will make it substantially less likely that grand 
met will ever successfully acquire the entire pillsbury company 
grand mets attorneys said in a letter to the delaware chancery 
court 
the court is reconsidering the validity of pillsburys poison 
pill defense an attempt by the minneapolisbased food and 
restaurant company to thwart a takeover the pill is designed to 
discourage grand met from buying tendered shares since to do so 
would increase the price 
pillsbury spokesmen did not immediately return a phone call 
wednesday 
on tuesday grand met extended to nov 18 its 60pershare offer 
for pillsbury saying that 791 percent of pillsbury stock now has 
been tendered to the british firm it was the third extension of the 
offer which was launched oct 4 
grand met said nearly 676 million shares of pillsbury common 
stock had been tendered and not withdrawn by the monday night 
deadline when it extended its second deadline of nov 8 grand met 
reported that about 743 percent of pillsburys outstanding shares 
had been tendered 
pillsbury which has rejected the bid as inadequate had no 
comment tuesday on the extension of the offer 
pillsbury chairman philip smith has told pillsbury shareholders 
they would be better off holding on to their stock because pillsbury 
has proposed spinning off burger king into a separate public company 
in a restructuring that would include a special dividend pillsbury 
shareholders would receive the dividend and burger king stock under 
the plan additional moves also are being considered to enhance 
shareholder value smith has said 
grand mets attorneys in the letter to the delaware court 
characterized the burger king spinoff proposal as a poison tax 
designed to kill any deal while the spinoff which is scheduled to 
occur dec 2 is structured to be taxfree for current pillsbury 
holders it would create a huge tax liability for any third party 
who bought pillsbury after dec 2 
attorneys for pillsbury shareholders urged the court to set a 
hearing on motions to extend that date the journal reported the 
holders say they needed more time partly because they dont have 
detailed information yet on the spinoffs tax consequences 
grand mets letter describes the spinoff plan as another time 
bomb planted by pillsburys management to deter the acquisition of 
the company by grand met or any other party

the us merchandise trade deficit narrowed to 105 billion in 
september the government said today in a report that led to 
declines in the value of stocks bonds and the dollar 
the deficit figure although smaller was toward the high end of 
market expectations and raised the possibility that the dollar would 
need to fall further to make american goods cheaper in world markets 
the numbers showed improvement theres no question about it 
but the absolute numbers still pretty high said john mccarthy 
chief dealer of amsterdam rotterdam bank in new york 
exports set a record while imports dropped slightly from their 
record levels of august the commerce department said 
currency traders said they believed the federal reserve had 
bought dollars with japanese yen to support the us currency but 
it had little effect and the dollar soon resumed its decline 
the dollar fell about half a percent against the japanese yen and 
1 percent against the west german mark by late morning in new york 
dipping to 1226 japanese yen and 1728 west german marks from 1232 
yen and 1743 marks late tuesday the dollar is now slightly above 
its lowest point against the yen since modern exchange rates were 
established in the late 1940s 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 1903 points 
to 205814 as of 11 am on wall street declining stocks 
outnumbered advancing ones by a 7to2 margin on the new york stock 
exchange 
in the credit market the price of the treasurys benchmark 
30year bond fell its yield which moves in the opposite direction 
rose to 906 percent from 901 percent late tuesday as recently as 
nov 1 the long bond yielded just 876 percent 
the 22 percent or 700 million september export increase to a 
record 282 billion was led almost entirely by higher sales of 
american autos data processing and office equipment and chemicals 
the department said 
for the first nine months of the year the trade deficit is 
running at an annual rate of 1372 billion compared with a record 
1703 billion last year and 1551 billion in 1986 
in another report today the commerce department said business 
inventories jumped 07 percent in september the 21st consecutive 
monthly increase while sales remained virtually unchanged 
the combination of rising inventories and flat sales is a sign of 
economic weakness however business sales have been generally 
strong this year and economists said the gain in inventories during 
most months was in line with sales 
on wall street tuesday stocks rose marginally in the lightest 
trading in seven weeks investors had been reluctant to participate 
ahead of the trade report 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 1209 points to 
207717 
volume on the new york stock exchange fell to 11517 million 
shares down from 14290 million in the previous session and the 
lowest since a 11372 millionshare day sept 28 
worries about accelerating inflation sparked by the retail sales 
report released tuesday initially drove bond prices sharply lower 
although they later recovered on the strength of falling prices for 
crude oil and other key commodities 
anticipation of the september trade figures also kept foreign 
exchange trading edgy the dollar fell to 12323 japanese yen in 
late new york trading from 12375 yen monday 
in other economic developments tuesday 
the federal reserve board reported that us industrial 
production rose 04 percent in october the biggest increase in 
three months despite a decline in activity in the nations oil 
fields 
us automakers reported that their car and light truck sales 
rose 149 percent in early november compared with results a year 
earlier that were depressed by the absence of buyer incentives 
a majority of the nations smallbusiness owners believe the 
federal budget deficit is the no 1 issue facing presidentelect 
george bush and they favor spending cuts to reduce the shortfall 
according to a poll by the accounting firm arthur andersen amp co 
the commerce department said retail sales rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 1356 billion in october boosted by gains at department 
stores and auto dealerships it also revised its figures for the two 
previous months showing a brisker sales pace than previously 
thought 
these numbers give a much different picture than just a month 
ago some people were betting the expansion would die of old age 
these numbers refute that strongly said david jones an economist 
with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in new 
york 
but he said the unexpected strength has rekindled concern about 
inflation which had waned as growth cooled in august and september 
in the latest report the government said retail sales fell 03 
percent in september up from an earlier estimate of a 04 percent 
decline and rose 03 percent in august rather than falling 01 
percent as previously thought

colby chandler chairman and chief 
executive officer of eastman kodak co has spent 38 years learning 
the lessons of business the theories of economics and the 
insideout story of the worlds largest photography company 
now after five years at the helm of kodak chandler is ready to 
take his message on the future of manufacturing to the masses 
so move over lee iacocca because here comes colby america 
wont make it without manufacturing chandler 
at 63 the lowkey engineer who grew up and still lives on a 
farm is learning how to become a standup spokesman for corporate 
america if it sounds political it is 
watching the swing toward a serviceintensive society and 
listening to some parties say thats good is scary said chandler 
in an interview at kodaks headquarters in rochester 
i have no intention of talking to the walls on this subject 
chandler said 
kodaks chief has been out preaching the manufacturing gospel to 
business groups college students politicians and anybody else who 
will listen the company also commissioned a study by three leading 
economists on the importance of manufacturing and started its 
firstever public affairs advertising campaign on the issue 
chandler also is using his last few weeks as chairman of 
president reagans export council the chief advisory group to the 
department of commerce to drum up support 
the importance of manufacturing to the economy has been 
something thats been so obvious to me and im sure to others like 
me that it might not have ever occurred to us that it wasnt 
obvious to everyone else he said 
although leaders of service industries might disagree chandler 
claims that one job making a car or a copier or a computer is 10 
times more valuable to the economy than a job selling insurance or 
waiting on customers in a bank or making airline reservations 
the percentage of workers employed in manufacturing in america 
20 percent of the work force is lower than at any time this 
century according to the kodakcommissioned study the case for 
manufacturing in americas future 
what that means chandler said is that the large multiplier 
effect manufacturing has in stimulating the economy through higher 
wages buying supplies and raw materials and creating new and 
improved products is drying up 
its a very critical edge that we walk chandler said 
were not the country with leading productivity gains thats a 
sign when we reach the real crisis we will have gone so far that 
bringing it back is going to take decades and decades 
the best way to help manufacturing in the immediate future would 
be to eliminate the federal deficit chandler said but for the 
longterm he suggested 
urging the government to make education and other 
peopleoriented benefits a priority 
using spending and tax policies to encourage investment in new 
technology and research 
implementing an incremental investment tax credit that would 
provide incentives for companies to expand a plant or buy new 
equipment 
altering the nations tax structure to put a higher emphasis on 
taxing consumption rather than the current system of taxing 
investment and saving 
chandler has always had a reputation on wall street as mr long 
term even before he took over as chairman of kodak 
he came to the company in 1950 after graduating from the 
university of maine with a physics degree his worked as a quality 
control engineer and then held various management positions 
he received a masters degree in management from massachusetts 
institute of technology in 1964 and directed the development of 
kodaks ektaprint copiers and duplicators in 1973 he was named 
president of the company in 1977 and chairman in 1983 
as chairman chandler has sent the yellow kodak banner charging 
into japan and given assemblyline workers almost complete control 
over film and other products they make 
and hes added aspirins batteries and household cleaners to the 
list of products kodak sells through new ventures and the 
acquisition of sterling drug co 
he never seemed as concerned with the nuts and bolts stuff of 
today or tomorrow what interested him was kodak three five 10 20 
years from now said brian fernandez a stock analyst with brean 
murray foster securities 
when chandler started kodaks restructuring effort several years 
ago to cut out layers of management and give each employee more 
responsibility chandler said he restructured his job to include a 
more active role in outside affairs that affect the company 
unfortunately it appears that no one seems to care about the 
eroding manufacturing base of the country especially the 
politicians chandler said 
hes learning how to handle himself in the political world where 
almost everything that is said has very little substance and in 
the media where words have to be carefully chosen 
its basic public relations chandler admits but its something 
hes only starting to understand 
if government officials were doing their jobs correctly he said 
he wouldnt have to worry about developing an expertise in 
communications 
theyre patching up problems and theyre responding to special 
interests and theres very little sitting back in a statesmanlike 
way saying where do we want to lead this country chandler said 
you perhaps could make an observation that they cant my 
feeling is they must

elderly and disabled people who have been 
denied social security benefits would face tougher requirements for 
appealing the decisions under new rules proposed by the government 
the social security administration calls the proposal preliminary 
and says final action is unlikely before next spring 
such a rule would meet strong opposition from congress said rep 
edward r roybal dcalif chairman of the house aging committee 
the private national committee to preserve social security and 
medicare said the proposal would be stacking the deck against 
recipients 
the american association of retired persons said the rule change 
if adopted appears to violate the spirit of the social security 
program 
the proposal by the agencys office of hearings and appeals has 
not yet been reviewed by social security commissioner dorcas hardy 
said agency spokesman phil gambino 
under the proposed rule change people who are challenging the 
denial of benefits would be required to submit all of their evidence 
in advance of a hearing before an administrative law judge he said 
tuesday 
currently new evidence may be submitted during the hearing but 
gambino said the proposal would allow that only if new information 
had come to light too late to be produced ahead of time 
also gambino said a prehearing meeting would be required in an 
effort to outline the areas of disagreement 
gambino said the proposal was just a brainstorming idea and 
is expected to go through several governmental levels before a final 
decision is made 
the current appeals process can last four to six months gambino 
said about half of all cases are reversed on appeal 
ken hoagland spokesman for the national committee to preserve 
social security and medicare said social security was trying to 
stack the deck against disability appeal claimants 
they are tyring to change the rules if you cant win under the 
rules of evidence that exist now change the rules its stacking 
the deck thats what it is 
martin corry aarps social security staff specialist said he 
had not yet seen the draft of the notice of proposed rulemaking 
but he said aarp hopes that such a change would get the close 
attention of secretary of health and human services otis bowen 
because as a physician he would bring to that consideration 
perhaps a better understanding of the potential harm that could be 
done to disabled persons 
older and disabled persons have earned their social security 
and medicare benefits and once again the administration is trying to 
deny vulnerable citizens what they are entitled to said royball 
he said he finds it interesting that the proposed change is becoming 
known the week after the election

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today that continuing high federal budget deficits represent a 
dangerous corrosion of the us economy and must be reduced 
greenspan joined a number of other top economic experts 
testifying as the national economic commission launched its 
postelection effort to come up with solutions to the sevenyear 
budgetary deadlock 
while the budget deficit was often ignored during the 
presidential debates greenspan and many other witnesses told the 
advisory panel that it was the major problem facing presidentelect 
george bush and the new congress 
bush has been forced in recent days to calm jittery financial 
markets by stating that he plans to make deficitreduction a top 
priority and will meet with congressional leaders to come up with an 
acceptable package 
many of the witnesses before the commission said this is exactly 
what bush needs to do and several said that unless a credible 
deficit agreement is reached quickly the country faces continued 
turmoil in financial markets 
greenspan given his sensitive position as head of the us 
central bank was not as ed 7494 billion sales 
fell a scant 35 million to 4954 billion 
the combination of rising inventories and flat sales is a sign of 
economic weakness if the trend continued it could lead to fewer 
orders from retailers so they could sell off their backlog of 
goods and consequently to production cutbacks and layoffs at 
manufacturing plants

the overall rate is approaching the 85 percent threshold that 
economists believe clearly signals a pickup in inflation 
capacity use has grown or held steady for eight consecutive 
months raising concern that factories will have trouble producing 
enough goods to meet demand leading to shortages and price

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade in a continuation of the price 
slide that began late last week 
crop futures prices have closed lower in three of the last four 
sessions and todays lower opening was just followthrough from 
the liquidation taking place said ted mao grain specialist with 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the agriculture departments announcement late tuesday of the 
sale of 12 million metric tons of corn to the soviet union had been 
expected and had little effect on prices this morning analysts said 
and while the decline in us grain prices appeared to be 
generating some new buying interest in europe it will take a much 
larger boost in demand to propel prices higher mao said 
in early trading wheat was cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 413 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to cent lower with december at 265 a bushel oats

look under christmas trees across the country 
this year and youll find packages with the name nintendo waiting 
for millions of children 
the toy industry has its first megahit in two years in the 
japanesemade video game but there are a lot of smaller homegrown 
hits as well with familiar names like barbie gi joe and real 
ghostbusters leading the pack 
nintendo has surged to the forefront of the toy industry 
although it hasnt created the hysteria that cabbage patch kids did 
in the mid1980s when some stores had several nearriots as parents 
fought over the dolls that were in short supply 
but even without shoving matches among prospective buyers the 
video game is expected to rack up a phenomenal 17 billion in us 
sales for 1988 more than double the 800 million it had last year 
by comparison coleco industries incs cabbage patch kids did 600 
million in 1985 their peak year 
the toy industry as a whole is expecting sales to run about even 
or slightly ahead of last years 125 billion according to the toy 
manufacturers of america a trade group the lions share of that 
business is done at christmas 
this holiday season several nintendo games are among the 
musthave toys super mario brothers ii zelda ii and double 
dragon 
but industry watchers caution consumers to shop early because 
supplies of the chips needed to make the game cartridges have been 
tight rick anguilla editor of the trade newspaper toy amp hobby 
world predicted you can count on plenty of shortages for 
nintendo softwear 
nintendo represents the first major hit in the toy industry since 
worlds of wonder incs lazer tag in 1986 the video game also was 
the standout last year when the rest of the industry was in a slump 
nintendos success has given the japanese company a massive 85 
percent share of the video game market up from 70 percent at end of 
1987 anguilla estimated 
the companys sales have come at the expense of usmarketed 
video games such as mattel incs sega and atari corps video 
system as a result hasbro inc recently announced it was 
discontinuing its nemo video game 
other toy companies such as ljn decided against competing with 
nintendo and instead are producing nintendo softwear under 
licensing agreements said anguilla who commented if you cant 
beat em join em 
the japanese import was one of the few hightech items to succeed 
in 1987 consumers spent millions of dollars on nintendo but they 
shunned other highpriced electronic toys in favor of dolls board 
games and preschool items like play food 
seeing this trend manufacturers put greater emphasis in 1988 on 
these toys which cost less to produce and are more profitable 
the us companies also gave up their dependence on action 
figures superheroes aliens and robots tied to television shows 
the toy makers helped produce the shows but when the segment 
declined they got out of the entertainment business which had been 
another expensive proposition 
a lot of manufacturers out there are getting back to what they 
do best making toys anguilla said 
among the casualties in the action figure segment was hasbros 
inhumanoids 
while the strategy of marketing figures with a tv show is fading 
television tieins are not completely dead universalmatchboxs 
talking peewee herman doll and kennerparker toys real 
ghostbusters are among the tv figures that remain big sellers 
according to angela bourdon a spokeswoman for toys r us inc the 
nations largest toy store chain 
other action figures that are popular are kennerparkers 
starting lineup which is based on reallife athletes and 
playmates mutant ninja turtles 
gi joe hasbros military action figure and a perennial 
favorite also continues to thrive 
other big sellers among boys toys are radiocontrolled cars hot 
wheels by mattel and micro machines small cars and trucks produced 
by lewis galoob toys inc 
micro machines have helped galoob recover from its 1987 slump 
when the company like many other toy manufacturers overinvested 
in expensive hightech failures 
for girls mattels barbie is expected to have her best year ever 
as she approaches the grand old age of 30 
some newer entries in the doll market are also expected to have a 
good season those cited by anguilla and ms bourdon included lewis 
galoobs bouncin babies 7inchtall batteryoperated dolls 
hasbros dolly surprise which has hair that grows and mattels 
little miss makeup 
dolls are going to be a monster category anguilla predicted 
play food those miniature cans of soup and vegetables was a 
surprise hit last year and continues strong in 1988 
fisherprices fun with food which led the preschool segment in 
1987 is doing well again this year the company has extended the 
line to include its magic scan checkout a pretend supermarket 
checkout counter that ms bourdon labeled a big seller at toys r us 
among board games pictionary by games gang ltd and its 
counterpart from hasbros milton bradley line called win lose or

grain futures closed mostly lower while soybean 
futures finished slightly higher wednesday on the chicago board of 
trade 
analysts said the quiet session appeared to mark the end of the 
recent selling wave 
it looks like a lot of the liquidation has run its course it 
looks like the market is finally finding some support at these lower 
levels said ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton 
inc in new york 
grain and soybean prices had declined in three of the previous 
four trading sessions as the market reflected dismay at the 
relatively slow pace of grain sales for export 
the soviet unions purchase this week of at least 15 million 
metric tons of us corn helped steady the corn market analysts 
said and the general drop in prices appeared to be generating some 
new buying interest in europe 
at the close wheat was 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 410 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to cent higher with december at 264 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 4 cents lower with december at 205 a bushel 
and soybeans were cent to 2 cents higher with november at 746 a

the dollars rapid slide toward 40year lows 
illustrates the truth of a favorite maxim of traders the trend is 
your friend 
the sharp drop of the dollar on wednesday was attributed to the 
governments trade deficit report but a bigger factor was probably 
the general bearish mood in the markets 
as long as the trend in the dollar appeared to be downward few 
traders were willing to buy dollars even if they happened to believe 
the trade report was fundamentally good for the us currency 
if the markets mood had been more positive it is possible the 
dollar might have rallied in response to the same commerce 
department report of a 105 billion merchandise trade deficit for 
the month of september 
traders dont care whats going to happen next week they care 
about today or tomorrow said shafiqul islam a senior fellow for 
finance at the council on foreign relations in washington 
this is not to say that currency exchange rates have nothing to 
do with fundamental factors such as trade patterns inflation and 
economic growth but since economists and government leaders cannot 
agree on what the rates really should be there is plenty of room 
for speculation 
the dollar on wednesday neared its lowest point against the 
japanese yen since the establishment of modern exchange rates in the 
late 1940s it fell to 1224 yen and 1723 west german marks a 
decline of more than 8 percent against the yen and 7 percent against 
the mark since early october 
ironically in early october the dollar was rising so powerfully 
that central banks were striving to slow its ascent by selling 
dollars in the open market in a complete reversal the federal 
reserve on wednesday was buying dollars to support the currency 
it doesnt matter to traders whether the dollar rises or falls 
as long as it does not move sideways often traders sitting at 
their computer screens will sell dollars into a dull market just to 
see if they can start a chain reaction 
exchange markets are horrified by the idea of the stability of 
exchange rates said islam 
big banks in japan europe and the united states dominate the 
world foreignexchange markets trading currencies both for clients 
and for their own accounts when currency rates are stable their 
business dries up 
foreignexchange trading is becoming an increasing line item in 
banks profits said brent erensel an analyst for donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp its fairly profitable 
the steep decline of the us currency has many traders 
explaining why the dollar should be falling focusing mainly on the 
massive us trade deficit 
the explanations may well be correct but only last month when 
the dollar was surging upward some of these same traders were 
offering explanations to justify the rise 
the truth is that traders care more about buying low and selling 
high than they care about debates among economists over whether the 
dollar is fundamentally overvalued or undervalued

the cocacola co applied to the indian 
government wednesday for permission to set up a production unit in a 
free trade zone near the capital the company announced 
the unit would manufacture ingredients for cocacola concentrate 
to be sold in markets outside india according to a company 
statement but the company planned limited domestic sales of the 
products in accordance with rules governing export production in 
free trade zones the statement said 
the project if approved would make india an important new 
supply base for the companys expanding international operations 
the statement said 
the unit would cost the company 33 million rupees or about 22 
million the statement said 
free trade zones are governmentdesignated areas where companies 
can set up manufacturing units with substantial tax and excise 
reductions if most of the produce is exported 
cocacola withdrew from india in 1977 rather than follow 
government directives to dilute its ownership and reveal its secret 
formula 
at that time it had been operating for 27 years and had licensed 
at least 20 companies to bottle its soft drinks 
the cocacola bid comes almost two months after pepsico inc was 
allowed to sell its soft drinks in indian markets in september the 
government approved a venture between pepsico and two indian 
companies to produce processed foods and softdrink concentrate 
the pepsico soft drinks are not expected on the market for at 
least two years the company made its proposal to the government in 
june 1986 but it was not approved until two years later 
cocacola based in atlanta and pepsico based in purchase 
ny are the bigest soft drink makers in the united states

michigans request for federal protection from 
canadian automotive trade practices was rejected wednesday by the 
us trade representative who said state officials had no right to 
file such a petition 
trade representative clayton yeutter in his decision also said 
the states request had been superceded by a freetrade agreement 
negotiated between the united states and canada 
michigan gov james blanchard asked yeutter last month to declare 
that canadas dutyremissions program constituted an unfair and 
illegal trade practice that discriminates against us automotive 
manufacturers 
under the program canada gives duty rebates on autos to foreign 
manufacturers in return for the use of canadian parts in their cars 
the freetrade agreement which is awaiting canadian 
parliamentary approval would allow the canadian rebate programs to 
remain in place through 1996 a timespan us critics say would 
enable canadian parts suppliers to build longterm ties with 
foreignowned manufacturers 
both the free trade agreement and the us legislation to 
implement the agreeement specifically address the issue complained 
of in the petition yeutter said so an investigation now is 
simply not appropriate 
he also said the law gives government officials no right to file 
petitions under the legal provision cited by michigan 
the law is designed instead for petitions by private parties 
that have a direct economic stake in the issues yeutter said 
the trade representative has never accepted a petition under that 
seciton of the law filed solely by a government official he 
said 
blanchard said he rejected yeutters contention that michigan had 
no right to file a petition 
nothing in the law or in the trade representatives own 
implementing regulations precludes a state from filing a complaint 
against unfair and illegal trade practices blanchard said they 
speak only to parties with significant economic interest 
something which the state of michigan has in this matter 
the director of the american automotive parts association a 
trade group representing us parts manufacturers said his 
organization was considering filing a petition of its own on behalf 
of its members 
michigans petition argued that the program discriminated against 
us parts purchases and amounted to an illegal subsidy of exports 
of canadian parts to the united states and other nations through 
their inclusion in thirdcountry automobiles 
canada gave 22 million in automotive duty remissions in its 
19861987 fiscal year and the practice would cost us parts 
manufacturers an estimated 132 million in business in 1990 the 
state said 
large japanese automakers such as honda nissan and toyota 
benefited from the program in 1986 and 1987 the state said 
the agreement has been approved by the congress but was under 
heavy attack in canadas parliament by opposition parties that 
feared economic and cultural absorption of their nation by its large 
southern neighbor 
the issue figures heavily in the campaign leading up to canadas 
national elections on monday

us coal exports from great lakes ports 
traveling though the st lawrence seaway more than tripled from 
april through october compared with a year ago seaway officials 
said wednesday 
they said us coal exports reached 569000 metric tons from 
april through october compared with 165000 metric tons for the 
same period a year ago 
the officials expressed optimism that the increase in coal 
exports though the inland waterway will continue resulting in a 
sixyear high at the end of the 1988 shipping season 
the announcement came about a week after the seaway reported a 
record amount of us export steel would move through the channel by 
yearend 
us coal exports through the seaway for all of 1987 totaled 
234000 metric tons in 1985 and 1986 the highest years for coal 
shipments through the seaway since 1982 coal exports just exceeded 
600000 tons each year the 1982 total was 11 million metric tons 
spurring the demand for americanmined coal were the lower value 
of the dollar competitive worldwide ocean freight rates a tight 
supply due to a series of industrial disputes last summer in 
australia sanctions against using south african coal and 
production problems and rising production costs in poland the 
seaway said in a news release 
james l emery administrator of the saint lawrence seaway 
development corp which operates the us portion of the 
americancanadian channel credited 1986 seaway trade mission stops 
in norway and denmark the majority of us export coal through the 
system so far this year has been transported to denmark for power 
production he said 
our visits to those countries provided great lakes coal 
representatives the chance to build relationships with those looking 
to buy coal emery said in a statement no sooner did we get 
back to the us when our people in coal went back over to close new 
deals 
canada steamshp lines inc which participated in the 1986 trade 
mission has transported the majority of the coal through the seaway 
this season according to the release as of oct 31 it had moved 
nearly 500000 metric tons of us coal from lake erie ports 
nationally 1988 us coal exports as of aug 31 totaled 522 
million metric tons up 15 percent from the same period last year 
according to the national coal association 
the seaway begins at the mouth of the st lawrence river and runs 
through the great lakes ending 2342 miles later at duluth minn

a british securities fraud probe that suggests 
ivan boesky duped drexel burnham lambert inc could give the 
troubled firm a potent new attack on the credibility of the 
imprisoned insider trader who has implicated drexel in illegal acts 
and is expected to be a star witness against the investment house 
legal experts said wednesday that the british investigation also 
may mean new trouble for boesky if he had not disclosed the alleged 
fraud against drexel to us prosecutors when he negotiated a 
pleabargain agreement two years ago 
under that pact boesky is required to divulge all wrongdoing 
even though he wont be indicted for it but if he fails to be fully 
candid prosecutors can scrap the plea agreement and charge him with 
every crime he had admitted 
certainly if anything material was omitted by somebody under a 
normal cooperation agreement it would permit the prosecutor to 
reopen the charges and do what he pleases said a lawyer familiar 
with the case who spoke on the condition he not be identified by 
name 
officials from the securities and exchange commission and 
manhattan us attorneys office would not comment on preliminary 
results of the british probe first reported in wednesday editions 
of the new york times 
charles carberry a private attorney in new york and former 
federal prosecutor who helped draft the boesky plea agreement also 
declined to comment as did charles davidow a boesky attorney in 
washington 
formerly wall streets bestknown speculator boesky shocked the 
business world two years ago when he paid the sec a record 100 
million to settle previously undisclosed charges of insider trading 
the misuse of secret information to profit in the financial markets 
in exchange for his cooperation in implicating other wrongdoers 
boesky was allowed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge of 
conspiracy to lie to the sec for which he began serving a 
threeyear term in march 
partly as a result of boeskys disclosures the sec accused 
drexel sept 7 of numerous frauds many involving an alleged scheme 
to use the speculator as a front to profit from insider trading 
manipulate stocks and hide them in his name to avoid reporting 
requirements an illegal practice called stock parking the 
manhattan us attorneys office is expected to seek criminal 
charges against drexel as well the firm has denied any wrongdoing 
and has denounced boesky as a scheming liar 
while the thrust of the us allegations suggests drexel 
exploited boesky for its benefit the british stock exchange 
investigation indicates boesky was victimizing drexel lawyers said 
the british probe could boost drexels legal defense by convincing a 
jury that boesky was deceptive and conniving 
anything a witness has done that casts discredit on his honesty 
is obviously useful to someone against whom that witness is 
testifying said gerard lynch a columbia law school professor 
thats especially true if the witness has gotten some deal from 
the government 
another attorney familiar with the drexeldefense strategy who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said if boesky takes the stand 
hes going to be hammered about this it clearly helps drexels 
case 
drexel spokesman steven anreder asked for comment about the 
british probe said it would appear to us that if these 
allegations are proven to be true it is yet another example that 
ivan boesky is unreliable and not believable 
the british probe suggests a drexelbacked boesky partnership 
called seemala corp broke an agreement with the firm and violated 
stock reporting requirements by parking securities in a secret 
account unknown to drexel 
the probe also suggests the london brokerage seligmann harris amp 
co participated in boeskys alleged scheme to cheat drexel robert 
harris the brokerages senior partner may face disciplinary 
sanctions by the exchange 
harris was quoted by the new york times as saying he didnt 
knowingly break any rules and feels deceived by boesky as well 
there was no answer at seligmann harriss london office late 
wednesday but stanley arkin a new york lawyer retained by harris 
said it would be characteristic of boesky to play both ends 
against the middle

cocoa futures prices surged wednesday on new yorks coffee sugar 
amp cocoa exchange on rumors that the ivory coast and france had 
reached an agreement to withhold a large amount of newcrop ivorian 
cocoa beans from the world market 
on other exchanges silver futures sagged but gold was little 
changed copper futures retreated stockindex futures plunged 
grains were lower soybeans were higher and livestock meat and 
energy futures were mixed 
rumors of an impending cocoa pact between france and the ivory 
coast have kept the cocoa market on edge for weeks but on 
wednesday the agreement was said to have been finalized and an 
announcement was expected at any time 
cocoa settled 35 to 59 higher with the contract for delivery in 
december at 1392 per metric ton the rally erased all of the 
previous days sharp losses 
the ivory coasts policy of withholding its prized cocoa from the 
market in an attempt to force prices higher hit a snag this fall 
when the west african nation ran short of storage space for its 
newly harvested crop analysts said 
the former french colony appealed to the french government and 
has reportedly been negotiating for frances cooperation on a new 
withholding plan 
i would say they are very close to an agreement and may indeed 
have reached one today said sandra kaul cocoa market analyst 
with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
she said she did not know the details but it was rumored that a 
large parisbased trading house would buy a large quantity of 
ivorian cocoa which it would withhold from the world market by 
government command 
analyst kim badenhop of prudentialbache securities inc in new 
york said the amount to be withheld from the market was rumored to 
be 400000 metric tons slightly less than twothirds of the ivory 
coasts new crop 
thats taking a lot of cocoa off the market and the markets 
been responding to that he said 
the speculation went that the ivorians would try to sell the 
remainder of their cocoa at prices above the world market price 
but analysts said few market players expected the scheme to work 
they wont be able to withhold as much as they want off the 
market or to maintain the high asking price ms kaul said no 
one will give them money unless they drop their prices 
silver futures slumped on new yorks commodity exchange after 
independent professional traders tried and failed to rally the price 
for march delivery up to 660 a troy ounce said bernard savaiko 
an analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
gold was little changed despite the weakening of the dollar a 
bullish cue for precious metals 
gold settled unchanged to 40 cents higher with december at 
42560 a troy ounce silver was 93 cents lower across the board 
with december at 630 a troy ounce 
nearmonth copper futures finished lower for the fourth time in 
the last five sessions but savaiko said the selling was technically 
motivated and supplydemand factors remained bullish 
copper settled 19 cents lower to 15 cents higher with december 
at 128 a pound and the spot november contract at 135 a pound 
stockindex futures fell sharply on the chicago mercantile 
exchange on fears that the federal reserve board would respond to 
signs of rising inflation by raising interest rates analysts said 
the contract for december delivery of the standard amp poors 500 
settled 445 points lower at 26505 
grain futures settled mostly lower while soybeans finished mostly 
higher on the chicago board of trade in a quiet session that 
appeared to mark the end of the recent selling wave analysts said 
wheat settled 3 cents lower to 2 cents higher with december at 
410 a bushel corn was unchanged to 2 cents lower with december 
at 264 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with 
december at 205 a bushel and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 4

britains general electric co plc and siemens ag 
of west germany launched a 3 billion takeover bid wednesday for 
electronics rival plessey co plc plessey promptly rejected the 
offer 
the bidders said competition from america and asia made the 
merger vital for the european electronics industry 
gec which is unrelated to the usbased general electric co 
and siemens offered 225 pence or 407 a share for all of 
plesseys stock 
but plessey said it emphatically rejected the offer and 
strongly recommended that its shareholders take no action on the bid 
its shares jumped 54 pence or 97 cents a share to 230 pence or 
416 on the london stock exchange soon after the announcement 
the bidders said in a statement that they were forming a joint 
company gec siemens plc to make the offer to plessey 
in the statement they cited the approach of the 1992 removal of 
trade barriers within the 12country european economic community 
unless ec companies work together to make the most of available 
european resources they increasingly risk dependence on us and 
japanese technology to retain any real market presence even in the 
short term the statement said 
gec made a hostile 12 billionpound bid for plessey in 1986 but 
the british government blocked it saying the combination would grab 
too large a slice of the british defense electronics business the 
bid was worth about 2 billion at the time 
following the failure of that bid gec and plessey agreed to a 
friendly merger of their telecommunications businesses setting up 
gec plessey telecommunications holdings ltd also known as gpt 
but siemens and gec said the escalating cost of research and 
development scarce technical and managerial resources and 
relentless competition from the far east and north america 
prompted them to make the new bid 
they said that if the bid succeeded siemens would take a 
40percent stake in gpt with gec holding the balance and would 
work together on telecommunications research and development 
gpt and siemens will maintain their existing telecommunications 
product lines particularly gpts system x telephone switching 
system and siemens ewsd switching system but gpt and siemens hope 
successor systems will be developed jointly 
collaboration will encompass new products for the ec market 
and in particular for the massive us market where both companies 
gpt and siemens have achieved only limited success to date gec 
and siemens said 
gec plans to take a 50percent stake in siemens defense 
electronics business and a 51percent stake in plesseys recently 
acquired us defense electronics interests plessey agreed in july 
to buy the defense interests of singer co for 310 million 
to allay any government concerns about a monopoly the statement 
said plessey will continue to operate as a separate entity in 
europe but will be able to call on siemens products and technology

the dollar plunged along with stocks and bonds 
wednesday as bearish sentiment overwhelmed the governments report 
of a narrowing of the us merchandise trade deficit 
the trade numbers werent really that bad but the market 
sentiment was to push the dollar down no matter what said bill 
hand a currency trader at first pennsylvania bank in philadelphia 
the dollar registered its lowest close against the japanese yen 
in new york trading since modern exchange rates were established in 
the late 1940s falling nearly 1 percent to 12224 yen the dollar

nearly sixmonth lows against some european currencies 
the commerce department reported early wednesday that the trade 
deficit narrowed to 105 billion in september which was roughly in 
line with expectations of 9 billion to 11 billion 
traders immediate reaction was to send the dollar and bonds 
higher but the underlying bearish sentiment soon took hold and the 
dollar edged downward throughout the day 
traders selling dollars defied two reported attempts by the 
federal reserve to stabilize the currency through dollar purchases 
the dollars decline hurt stocks and bonds and in turn the 
weakness in those markets helped send the dollar lower said phillip 
eriksen a senior vice president at wells fargo bank in san 
francisco 
this is the first time weve seen the bond market the stock 
market and the foreign exchange market all going down at the same 
time theyre all focusing on each other eriksen said

203858 its lowest close since it stood at 200231 on sept 1 
in the bond market the yield of the benchmark 30year treasury 
bond jumped to 911 percent in late trading from 901 percent late 
tuesday bond yields rise when prices fall and are a good indicator 
of overall interest rate trends the trade report showed a record 
level of us exports and a 25 percent decline in imports from the 
august record but the deficits decline was not enough to comfort 
traders who have shown increasing concerns about the federal budget 
deficit and the united states dependence on inflows of foreign 
capital 
in many respects this is one of the least important trade 
numbers weve seen in a long time said stephen leach a currency 
analyst at chemical bank 
remarks by federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan were 
also interpreted negatively for the dollar dealers said 
answering questions before the us national economic commission 
greenspan said the united states cannot grow out of its budget 
deficit greenspan said the financial markets appear to be waiting 
for firm deficit reduction proposals from congress 
in tokyo where trading ended before the trade number was 
released the dollar rose 029 yen to a closing 12354 yen later in 
london it was quoted at 12340 yen in new york the dollar sank to 
12224 yen from 12323 yen late tuesday

an investment group waging a 27 billion hostile 
takeover bid for interco inc said it was close to scrapping the bid 
late wednesday because of the furnitureapparel companys stiff 
resistance 
cardinal acquisition corp a group controlled by mitchell and 
steven rales of washington dc said it was preparing to abandon a 
74ashare cash tender offer as of midnight est and return all 
tendered shares which amounted to nearly 90 percent of the 
companys 3556 million shares outstanding 
intercos stock price fell 187 a share to 6337 in composite 
new york stock exchange trading 
cardinals announcement came two days after interco a st 
louisbased maker and seller of products including florsheim shoes 
london fog raincoats and ethan allen furniture rejected another 
request for negotiations 
interco also indicated at that time that it planned to undertake 
a defensive restructuring which includes payment of a special 
dividend and the sale of some of its major businesses even if 
cardinal dropped its offer 
abandoning the bid would end the rales fourmonth fight to 
acquire interco which has rebuffed their maneuvers since an initial 
64ashare offer they made in july 
interco responded with a defensive restructuring plan that would 
cost 28 billion pay shareholders a special dividend plunge the 
company into debt and require the sale of some businesses to help 
pay it off 
the battle also extended into the courts of delaware where 
interco is incorporated when the rales sought to invalidate a 
socalled poison pill company bylaw that would make a hostile 
purchase prohibitively expensive 
although the delaware chancery court prohibited interco from 
using the poison pill defense in a ruling earlier this month the 
company appealed to the state supreme court which agreed to hear 
the matter nov 30 
the raleses have indicated previously they would not buy any 
interco shares until the issue was resolved 
interco employs about 54000 people nationwide and had sales of 
334 billion last year

it would save jobs and benefit san diego important objectives 
for us agee said to that end were doing everything possible 
to reach a timely and fair resolution in our discussions both with 
the nassco executive team and the navy

quarter of 1988 but lost 199 million in the second quarter and 
another 900000 during the third quarter which ended oct 30

international multifoods corp has paid 538 
million to buy back the 121 percent of its stock held by a group 
led by bregman partners of toronto ontario the food company 
announced wednesday 
multifoods has paid 3075 a share for 1751000 shares of 
multifoods common stock previously owned by bregman partners and its 
affiliates which last year indicated it might acquire up to 249 
percent of the companys stock 
multifoods stock closed wednesday at 3062 down 37 cents a 
share in new york stock exchange composite trading 
multifoods could repurchase up to 500000 additional shares of 
its common stock under a plan approved by the board of directors 
the company said 
bregman partners never made a tender offer to acquire multifoods 
but it said more than a year ago in a filing with the securities and 
exchange commission that it intended to buy more than 249 percent 
of multifoods outstanding shares 
according to its most recent sec filing bregman had purchased 
only 121 percent of the shares 
to the best of our knowledge we have purchased all of their 
holdings said linda berg a multifoods spokeswoman you never 
knew what their motives were 
bregman partners which includes the belzberg banking family of 
vancouver british columbia could not be reached for comment the 
investment group earlier had suggested that multifoods restructure 
its business but multifoods chairman andre gillette rejected the 
idea as a misleading and thinly disguised selfserving effort 
in late july the canadian group proposed a restructuring in 
which multifoods would sell its us grain merchandising mister 
donut chain and canadian operations other than industrial and 
consumer flour opeations to raise 120 million 
the partnership also proposed that the company borrow 270 
million and pay a special dividend of 28 in cash plus 6 in notes 
to the holders of its 146 million shares 
in rejecting the offer gillet proposed then to buy back the 
stock held by the partnership for 32 a share the closing price of 
the stock on the previous day 
multifoods which nearly doubled its earnings from continuing 
operations in fiscal 1988 has divested itself of its regional 
consumer food companies and flour mills in the united states in the 
past three years it also has acquired and consolidated companies 
that have given it a prominent position in the production and 
distribution of food for the hospitality industry and vending 
machines

navistar international corp sold its failing 
wisconsin steel subsidiary to avoid paying pensions and must give 
millions of dollars to the federal agency that is providing those 
benefits a judge ruled wednesday 
the decision by us district court judge james moran favored the 
pension benefit guaranty corp which has been paying the pensions 
of former wisconsin steel workers since the chicago mill collapsed 
in 1980 
this ruling sends a warning loud and clear to any others who 
may be tempted to try to unload their pension responsibilities that 
abusive tactics will not be tolerated pbgc attorney gary ford 
said 
navistar spokeswoman roxanne decyk said we feel that the very 
narrow finding of liability will be overturned on appeal 
morans ruling came four months after the close of a nineweek 
trial on the case 
navistar the former international harvester in 1977 sold 
wisconsin steel to envirodyne inc a los angeles engineering 
company with no previous steelmaking experience 
the mill which employed at least 3500 workers went bankrupt 
three years later the pension fund was lost and pbgc had to pay 
the workers pension benefits 
pbgc is a federal agency created to guarantee payment of pension 
benefits to workers participating in private defined benefit pension 
plans the agency now pays 77 million per year to 2000 former 
wisconsin steel workers said agency spokeswoman jane hoden in 
washington 
in its lawsuit the agency had asked for 146 million from 
navistar 63 million in wisconsin steel pensions plus interest 
but the exact amount of damages will be determined at a later date 
ms hoden said 
navistar has denied that it duped envirodyne into purchasing 
wisconsin steel for 65 million with a 50 million loan from 
navistar the sale was part of navistars move out of the steel 
business in order to concentrate on its core farmequipment and 
truckmanufacturing businesses the company has said 
the case is considered an important test of whether a company can 
be forced to honor pensionplan obligations to workers 
at present we are monitoring several transactions by 
companies ford said this ruling will strengthen our ability to 
deal with what we view as abuses of the pensioninsurance program 
during the trial navistar attorneys said wisconsin steels 
demise stemmed from many factors including two harsh winters and a 
sixmonth strike at navistar a wisconsin steel customer 
immediately before the mill collapsed 
last february navistar agreed to pay 148 million to 2700 
former wisconsin steel workers for benefits lost when the mill filed 
for bankruptcy under envirodynes ownership 
wisconsin steel creditors led by an envirodyne unit the edc 
holding co have filed a separate lawsuit seeking 475 million from 
navistar
