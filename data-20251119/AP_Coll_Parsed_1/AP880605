the british government will 
review the life sentences of dozens of convicted terrorist prisoners 
in this british province officials said sunday 
the life sentence review board will review the records of the 
special category inmates over the next six months and report back to 
britains northern ireland secretary tom king his office reported 
no reason was given for the review but it appeared aimed at 
reducing tensions 
the special category laws for suspected terrorists in northern 
irelands sectarian warfare were introduced in 1972 after inmates 
staged a hunger strike at belfasts maze prison demanding to be 
treated as political prisoners 
their special privileges include political status and allow them 
to avoid prison work wear their own clothes have extra visits and 
food parcels and to live in isolated groups 
in 1976 the special category status was ended for crimes 
committed after that date and in 1980 no more prisoners were 
admitted to the category 
there are now 90 special category prisoners compared with 1500 
in 1975 there are 31 members of the outlawed irish republican army 
27 of the mainly protestant ulster defense association and 32 from 
the outlawed ulster volunteer force 
all but five are serving life sentences or are detained on orders 
of the secretary of state 
the predminantly roman catholic ira is fighting to unite 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite the province with 
the irish republic which is overwhelmingly catholic

a 10foot alligator lunged from a 
residential lake seized a 4yearold girl who was wading with her 
brother and a friend and dragged her to her death 
game officers spotted the alligator on the bank of hidden lake 
around midnight carrying the limp body of erin glover in its jaws 
the reptile was immediately shot to death with a 357caliber magnum 
pistol said stephen condit red cross disaster services director 
the girls body was recovered he said 
since 1948 there have been 95 unprovoked alligator attacks in 
florida with five previous deaths said game commission lt jim 
farrior 
an autopsy of the alligator was performed on the scene and 
determined it to be the alligator that killed her charlotte 
county dispatcher john kefer said sunday he did not know what 
aspect of the autopsy identified the reptile as the killer 
erin was walking along the lakes south shore with her brother 
justin 8 their dog and neighbor jason kershanick 9 at 630 pm 
saturday when the gator bolted from the water and snapped up the 
girl in its teeth 
jason said sunday that the children were walking in ankledeep 
water 
the little girl was throwing rocks and kicking the water while 
she was kicking she must have kicked the alligator right when she 
stopped kicking the alligator jumped up out of the water and 
started biting her two times in the stomach jason said then he 
dropped her and she crawled away and then he got out of the water 
more and grabbed her from the back and went in the water 
after it happened then we ran he added it was pretty 
quick it seemed like a nightmare a dream but then the way she 
screamed when i saw the blood after he went in then i realized it 
was real 
alligators tend to pull their prey underwater drowning them and 
stashing the body for later feeding 
wayne kershanick went to the lake with a pistol after his son 
alerted him 
i saw it taking her off to the other side of the lake 
kershanik said i tried to track it through the weeds but by the 
time i got there he went under with her and that was the last i 
seen of him 
neighbor nolan jesse said he had heard erins mother screaming 
and took a rifle to the lake he said he saw a large alligator 
surface with a lightcolored object in its mouth 
it was within rifle range but i was afraid to shoot because of 
the object jesse said 
the gator was spotted after five divers had searched the lake and 
weeds surrounded by the gardens of gulf cove development while six 
florida game and fresh water fish commission officers and several 
deputies and emergency workers walked the land the area is about 25 
miles south of sarasota on floridas west coast 
it was a shock it will be a while getting over it erins 
stepfather ty bowns said outside the familys house 
all the kids around here played around all these lakes i dont 
think anybody took the alligators all that seriously 
justin was staying with neighbors after the incident 
kershanicks wife charlotte said nothing had been done about 
past alligator complaints 
a lot of them are aggravated because theyve complained about 
the alligators being here but nobody does anything she said 
they ought to have the ponds fenced in 
alligators once were vigorously hunted and their population 
dwindled in florida they were made a protected species in the 
mid1960s 
but in the past few years it has become clear that the species 
is in no danger of extinction said farrior 
state wildlife experts estimate there are 1 million alligators on 
67 million acres of land 
on sept 1 for the first time since 1962 the state will hold a 
onemonth gator hunt in which no more than 3000 are to be taken 
they occupy pretty much any body of water that would look like 
an alligator lives there and lots that dont farrior said 
last year 3853 gators were killed because they were declared a 
nuisance threatening children and livestock 
the attack on erin was the third gator attack on the gulf coast 
in the past six months both previous victims survived the attacks

for 65 hours six men were trapped deep 
underground after a mine explosion in central germany here based 
on interviews with the survivors mine officials rescue workers and 
german news reports is the story of their harrowing ordeal 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
huddled in the depths of a coal mine 
six trapped miners take turns banging hammers together to signal 
rescuers their colleagues keep as still as possible to save 
precious air 
lie down move as little as you can drink the water in sips 
and breath as regularly as possible veteran miner thomas gepperth 
barks to his fiveman crew 
toward the end of their 65hour ordeal their oxygen almost gone 
the men hear a rescue worker screaming into his walkietalkie i 
see a light i see two lights i see three lights i see people 
alive 
the drama begins at 1230 pm wednesday when a gas explosion 
traps 57 men in the mine in this town 70 miles northeast of 
frankfurt 
gepperth and his fiveman crew race toward the exit of the 
500footdeep shaft 
maybe the blasting material storeroom blew up the strapping 
36yearold gepperth says to himself 
out of the darkness illuminated by the lights on the miners 
helmets appears the figure of a colleague staggering toward them 
gepperth instantly recognizes the symptoms of the miners dreaded 
foe carbon monoxide 
he yells turn back turn back 
gepperth and his crew head in the other direction other men 
nearby race toward the exit into certain death from mounting levels 
of carbon monoxide that filled the tunnels 
gepperths crew wearing emergency masks containing about 45 
minutes worth of oxygen rush to a point more than a mile from the 
blast site in the underground labyrinth of tunnels 
guided by the flames of cigarette lighters they search for a 
space free of the deadly gas 
finally the group finds air and a chance for survival 
be quiet so you use up less oxygen gepperth orders 
huddled in the dark are 
egon dehn a bearded 36yearold father of two 
helmut gesner 27 engaged to be married in august 
heinz roese 33 married two years and the father of one 
wilfried doench at 21 the youngest of the group just four 
weeks earlier hed walked away unharmed from a car wreck 
ahmet batkan 33 the turkish immigrant has two children and his 
wife is expecting a third 
the sixth man is gepperth who is married he often sports a 
diamond earring in his left ear 
the men start shouting frantically into their walkietalkies 
one north 45 one north 45 six people they hope to give 
rescue workers their precise location 
radio contact is made but a radio operator orders the men to 
stop sending distress calls so he can try to reach other possible 
survivors they try using the walkietalkies again later but cant 
make contact 
the miners sit in the dark having turned off their miners 
lamps to save batteries with their only nourishment a sandwich and 
mineral water 
taking turns they pound two hammers together in rhythmic blows 
to try to catch rescuers attention the banging goes on for nearly 
65 hours 
gepperth tells his men to remember the miracle of lengede 
in which 11 miners were pulled to the surface two weeks after water 
flooded an iron mine in lower saxony in 1963 
some of the men start to make last wills and testaments but 
gepperth gruffly tells them you dont have to do that 
gepperth senses that the deadly carbon monoxide levels are 
advancing toward them and the group retreats into the furthest 
recesses of the mine 
finally their backs are against the wall they can go no further 
and must stay in a prisonlike space 6 feet high and 8 feet wide 
after waiting in vain thursday the men hear drilling on friday 
but it stops at midafternoon 
gesner says to himself have they forgotten us or something 
maybe they figure its not worth it he starts imagining he sees 
lights coming toward him but theres no one there 
they keep tapping louder and louder on friday night rescuers 
above think theyve heard something 
hours pass then one of the trapped men screams theyve 
drilled a hole 
at 421 am saturday the rescue worker calls that hes found 
the men 
a little more than an hour after theyre discovered the men are 
hoisted to the surface 
after all 57 miners had been given up for dead the miracle of 
borken had occurred

president reagans final meeting with major us 
trading partners coming just two weeks after the moscow summit 
will focus on both macro and micro from averting another stock 
market crash to debating whether longer shopping hours might ignite 
more economic growth in west germany 
reagan will meet with leaders of six other major industrial 
democracies britain france west germany italy canada and japan 
plus the european community in the downtown convention center of 
canadas biggest city june 1921 
the economic summit will give reagan an opportunity to brief his 
partners on his may 29june 2 talks with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev however two of the participants british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and japanese prime minister noburu takeshita got 
an early report from the president during his london stop last week 
toronto hoping that a favorable impression will bolster its bid 
to host the 1996 olympic games is busy sprucing up for an expected 
invasion of 1400 summit delegates and 5000 news media 
representatives 
the city has a graffiti squad scrubbing everything clean a giant 
parking lot is being converted into summit square where 
reporters will be offered free food and drink around the clock 
to guard against terrorist attacks 3000 police officers will be 
deployed around the city and sharpshooters will be stationed on 
rooftops along motorcade routes to prevent anyone from getting 
within a bombs throw of visiting foreign leaders 
the security operation will cost an estimated 6 million the 
equivalent of 48 million in the united states 
we are taking the precautions because of the history of 
terrorist attacks at previous summit conferences said police 
supt bernard nadeau rockets were fired in downtown tokyo at the 
1986 economic summit and bombs were thrown at embassies in rome 
during last years venice summit 
mrs thatcher in office since 1979 will be dean of the 
summiteers this will be reagans eighth such summit 
newcomers at the toronto summit will be takeshita and italian 
prime minister ciriaco de mita also attending will be west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand who 
will bring his new premier michel rocard 
host prime minister brian mulroney wants the 14th economic summit 
the annual parleys began in 1975 at rambouillet france to be 
less formal and more productive than its predecessors 
mulroney has ruled out the usual opening day festivities in favor 
of getting right down to business he plans to start with an 
afternoon working session on economic issues followed by a working 
dinner on political matters 
at the dinner clearly the the overarching theme will be 
eastwest relations says mulroney 
the second summit day will see an innovation a 90minute 
meeting without aides at which the leaders will toss around ideas 
about prospects for the next decade they are to discuss economics 
on the final day before closing with a news conference 
its essential that this summit concentrate rather heavily on 
economic issues said sylvia ostry canadas multilateral trade 
ambassador the summit is the terminal day of what is almost a 
continuing process of international economic cooperation 
ms ostry said the two major summit issues will be 
how to manage the transition from huge trade deficits and 
surpluses to balanced global trade 
how to prevent a repetition of the oct 19 stock market crash 
the crash did not result in a recession as some experts had 
predicted but continued growth has raised fears of a new 
inflationary spiral 
to avert that danger the bank of canada this week pushed 
interest rates to a twoyear high with prime rates rising to 1075 
percent 
us treasury secretary james baker is urging the seven summit 
nations to adopt an index of 35 to 40 key commodities including 
gold to help track inflation 
baker proposed last month that they also closely monitor growth 
rates and trade balances to better coordinate their economies in 
addition to watching exchange and interest rates and fiscal policies 
canada and the united states are expected to press the 12nation 
european community and japan for progress in the farm subsidy war 
that is crippling treasuries driving down prices and restricting 
markets 
summit leaders also are expected to consider options for solving 
the third world debt problem in which 121 developing countries owe 
a total of 125 trillion commercial banks want governments to 
increase contributions to the world bank and international monetary 
fund 
with monetary policies already being closely monitored canadian 
officials said the summit emphasis may focus on microeconomic 
policies such as taxation deregulation land use restrictions in 
japan or extension of west german shopping hours to boost imports

the bedposts are artificial trees and 
the suites private whirlpool is nestled in a crop of synthetic 
rocks complete with a miniwaterfall the walls are a deepgreen 
painted forest 
welcome to the treehouse suite part of the new fantasy wing of 
the burnsville royale hotel 
for 165 to 195 a night guests also can retire to an igloo a 
whaling ship a sheiks tent a california beach a 1973 olds or any 
of a number of settings at this latest addition to roger dehrings 
growing chain of fantasy hotels 
were really just another hotel company that has a part of its 
business thats a little unusual said dehring 43 of minnetonka 
owner of the refurbished burnsville motel and similar outposts in 
the wisconsin towns of antigo dodgeville and west bend 
before the fantasy wing opened here in may the hotel had the 
usual trappings for travelers convention and meeting rooms a 
restaurant swimming pool and 88 standard rooms for 42 to 50 
pernight 
in addition we have this one wing that looks like any other 
hotel wing until you open the room door dehring said 
in the moby dick suite guests are confronted with the wideopen 
mouth of a whale the whirlpool mandatory fare in the 12 fantasy 
suites is inside the behemoth ribs showing through a ceiling of 
whale stomach 
then theres the car suite bring back the memories bids the 
promotion on the hotel fare sheet the stars the moon and young 
loves first kiss in the backseat 
the beach room bedless offers sleep on a beige carpet randomly 
padded to give the impression of sand 
pharoahs tomb puts you inside a pyramid with sand and 
cementsprayed walls cracked to lend a more realistic look and feel 
its a very definite authentic feeling whatever authentic is 
i havent been there either dehring said 
the story of royale hospitality group inc the bloomingtonbased 
parent company of dehrings four hotels began at the don q inn in 
dodgeville the don q offers such oddities as a 120yearold barn 
for a restaurant and a steeple converted into a suite 
dehring bought it in 1979 and quickly learned that something out 
of the ordinary is something in demand 
weve kind of been expounding on it ever since said mike 
isabella hotel group president 
the two are full of ideas for more elaborate maybe impossible 
suites they picture guests sleeping on a 27foot boat floating in 
real water god and code willing dehring says 
another idea is a hotair balloon such a suite probably would 
have to be a threestory affair they said 
expansion of the chain is more than a brainstorm contracts have 
been signed for the purchase of new properties in muscatine iowa 
and greenwood ind 
with the burnsville specialty rooms already booked for the 
summer dehring and isabella think it will pay to build more of the 
unexpected at their fifth and sixth hotels theyll entertain all 
ideas in fact they give guests suite suggestion cards that 
solicit names and concepts for future rooms and promise a free night 
for winners

a huge blimplike balloon floating 
serenely in the southern arizona sky is a new weapon in a widening 
war a radarpacked eyeinthesky searching for airborne drug 
smugglers 
when it becomes fully operational this month the nearly 18 
million balloon will scan the sky to the south tracking lowflying 
planes that try to evade regular radar and helping us customs 
service aircraft chase smugglers within 80000 square miles 
the heliumfilled white balloon already has tracked planes 
twice leading to arrests and seizure of drugs said daniel wiley 
senior engineer and site manager for the contractor westinghouse 
defense and electronic systems co 
it is the first of at least five balloons customs officials hope 
to position along the southwest border to plug gaps in groundbased 
radar surveillance that have allowed smugglers to enter the country 
with impunity via mexico 
some residents near the giant balloons mooring on the southern 
edge of the fort huachuca military reservation say theyre worried 
that it poses a danger to them 
im sure the governments going to leave it there until it has 
an accident and then things will change and it ultimately will 
have an accident said harry woodward whose home is within the 
radius of the balloons 10000footlong tether 
within the balloons range are 1000 homes five churches and 
huachuca mountain elementary school where carol southland a 
secondgrade teacher is among those who appreciate its deterrent 
role in the war on drugs 
i just dont think the risk is there she said i dont 
think the balloons gonna run away through the neighborhood and 
carry off the children 
army and customs officials say the site was the best available 
and fears of an accident are unfounded 
the balloon has a rapid deflation device to allow operators to 
lower it quickly while controlling where it lands if it were to 
break from its tether 
sabotage would be the most likely cause of a breakaway from the 
mooring but it would be a difficult target for anything but a 
rocket wiley said 
because of the heliums low pressure you could put probably a 
dozen bullet holes in this aerostat out here and it would probably 
take us days to even find out we had a leak he said 
the balloon goes by various names aerostat for air stationary 
borne radar surveillance system sowrball southwest radar balloon 
fat albert and even little shamu after the whale of sea 
world fame 
at 245 feet long and 72 feet in diameter it dwarfs a boeing 747 
it weighs 12750 pounds including the 3500pound downlooking 
radar payload strapped to its underbelly 
but its eightlayered skin is puffpastry thin at 12 mils or 
12thousandths of an inch its about twice the thickness of the 
tape in an audio cassette 
that hightechnology skin has highintensity strength about 275 
pounds per linear inch wiley said 
the aerostat is anchored at a maximum height of 10000 feet by 
another hightech wonder a tether less than an inch in diameter and 
made of kevlar a lightweight material used in bulletproof vests 
the tether weighs 4250 pounds but can handle tension of more than 
75000 pounds inside the kevlar are three wires providing power for 
the radar package and other computerized controls all run by 
groundstation crew in an aroundtheclock command center 
what we have here is the latest technology in aerostats 
wiley said comparing it with another customs surveillance balloon 
flying in the bahamas or with two air force radar devices in florida 
is like comparing an f16 fighter to a p51 world war ii 
fighter he said 
its radar range is estimated at 160 miles which means it can 
provide detection over 80000 square miles thats enough to 
pinpoint planes within range of hermosillo the sonora mexico 
state capital or twice the distance from here to tucson 
the balloon is intended to operate except in snow or icy 
conditions thunderstorms or heavy winds conditions likely to keep 
smugglers grounded 
these cats arent gonna be flying through those thunderstorms 
either wiley said

the sandinista government and 
usbacked rebels are closer than ever to ending their 6year war 
but the last few steps to halt the fighting will be the most 
difficult 
the final measures are particularly crucial for the rebels known 
as contras who may negotiate themselves out of existence in peace 
talks scheduled to resume tuesday 
the rebels do not have the political structure to survive as a 
separate organization on the nicaraguan political scene their role 
likely will be taken over by the political parties already 
established in the country 
despite their rhetoric and posturing the contras and the 
government have been getting closer to a permanent agreement and 
have set a temporary truce that no one wants to break 
the two sides signed a preliminary agreement on march 23 in 
sapoa a small village on the costa rican border 
a 60day ceasefire which expired last tuesday has been 
extended until the two sides renew their discussions in managua the 
nicaraguan capital 
during the last negotiating session the government agreed to 
discuss some political reforms the contra leadership considers 
essential these include calls for political pluralism equality 
before the law the right to strike and a pluralistic electoral 
system 
the reforms deal with definitions of democratization 
concepts that first led to the war which has killed more than 
26000 people and ruined the countrys economy 
the contra leadership feels the sandinista regime is 
undemocratic repressive and based on marxismleninism 
when it comes to definition of freedom of the press civil 
rights human rights democracy we are using the same words with 
different meanings we are talking about two interpretations of 
reality based on different ideologies said virgilio godoy leader 
of the opposition independent liberal party 
i am reasonably optimistic there will be an agreement he 
said it is not a question here of defeating the government at the 
negotiating table but of finding a way to live together 
luis rivas leiva a contra adviser said the government must 
learn to live with what they term petite bourgeoisie we can live 
with some of their leaders 
bayardo arce deputy coordinator of the political commission of 
the ruling sandinista national liberation front said there are 
some in the opposition who have realized that there is political 
room for them here 
arce rejected charges that the government is trying to impose a 
communist state 
we came to power talking about building socialism in 
nicaragua he said but as we developed our struggle we 
understood the national realities and we opted for a system of mixed 
economy with private and government property 
eric ramirez president of the opposition social christian party 
called the sandinistas pragmatic and opportunistic but said 
there was little chance of a definite agreement on democratic 
reforms 
democratization is utopian in a country like ours where there 
has been no democracy for more than 60 years he said what we 
need is a continued process of democratic practices to test the 
political will of the government 
if we do not agree on this he said the government will 
act unilaterally enacting electoral laws and other changes that 
will make it look good abroad while still talking to a divided 
opposition 
the sandinista government already has announced plans for 
municipal elections before the 1990 presidential elections 
opposition party leaders believe the contras as an organization 
served a purpose in forcing the government to the negotiating table 
but are at their weakest while negotiating an end to the war 
ramirez said they will have to return and rejoin one of 
nicaraguas 14 political parties or form another party which is 
the last thing nicaragua needs ramirez said

mysterious circles of flattened crops in the 
british countryside over the centuries have been caused by 
stationary whirlwinds and not ghosts or ufos a scientist said 
saturday 
about 50 of the circles with diameters of 10 to 100 feet show 
up every summer usually in fields of long grass barley oats or 
wheat near hills said tornado expert terence meaden 
speaking at a conference in oxford he dismissed speculation the 
circles were caused by flying saucers helicopters flying upside 
down supernatural beings or even herds of rotating hedgehogs a 
small porcupine 
wind usually blows round both sides of a hill and merges 
smoothly round the other side meaden said however sometimes 
there is a gust on one side but not the other which creates vortices 
or sudden whirlwinds these sink to the ground and flatten crops in 
a spiral 
meaden said the tornado and storm research organization at 
bradford in northern england where he works investigated 150 crop 
circles over the past eight years

a navy rescue instructor yelled get 
him before a panicstricken recruit was forced back into the 
swimming pool where he died a classmate testified saturday 
the classmate airman apprentice gregory william boos was unable 
to identify which instructors were among the four or five who pulled 
airman recruit william mirecki 19 of appleton wis into the pool 
march 2 at the pensacola naval air station 
boos was the lead witness in an investigative hearing to 
determine whether six sailors should face courtmartial in the death 
of mirecki 
another one of mireckis classmates airman recruit gregory 
harkrider testified that the panicstricken recruit had shouted 
leave me alone i quit and indicated he was quitting the 
rescue school 
a heart specialist testified that heart failure most likely 
caused by fearinduced stress apparently killed mirecki but cmdr 
richard osborne a cardiologist at the naval aviation medical 
institute said his assessment was only conjecture based on a review 
of the autopsy report 
the doctor said the heart problem known medically as ventricular 
fibrillation also could have been caused by drowning 
hyperventilation or less likely by gastric juices coughed up by a 
victim during resuscitation attempts 
a third student airman apprentice paul shiver testified he 
heard the command as get mirecki 
seaman apprentice scott riemer said he overheard someone say 
maybe we used too much force during a meeting between two 
instructors and lt thomas torchia the schools commander shortly 
after mirecki was taken away in an ambulance 
riemer shiver boos and harkrider now are taking technical 
training at the memphis naval air station in tennessee 
prior to the testimony lt steven h cohen the lawyer for one 
of the accused petty officer 1st class richard e blevins 
complained that information from an investigation by the judge 
advocate generals office was being withheld on orders of the 
secretary of the navy 
cohen and lawyers for other defendants made a motion that the 
proceedings be suspended until that information is released 
presiding cmdr daniel j dalesio rejected the request saying 
administrative proceedings are separate from the criminal case and 
that he lacked authority to release the information 
lt cmdr larry d wynne the prosecutor assured defense lawyers 
the information would be made available before the conclusion of the 
hearing which is expected to last several days 
boos testified that mirecki panicked during a drill known as

movie and television producers met for about seven hours saturday 
and agreed only to return to the bargaining table sunday a 
spokeswoman said 
the two chief negotiators for the writers guild of america and 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers met from 1 
pm until 8 pm saturday at the producers headquarters said wga 
spokeswoman cheryl rhoden 
the two sides were scheduled to meet again sunday in an effort to 
end the 13weekold walkout she said 
the substance of the talks was withheld as were details of a 
negotiating session on friday i can only say the discussions are 
ongoing rhoden said saturday night 
the writers walked out march 7 in a dispute that centers on 
payments called residuals for reruns of onehour television shows 
demand for onehour shows in rerun or syndication is declining 
and the producers had sought to tie payments to a shows success in 
reruns 
also at issue in the strike are writers demands for more say 
over changes made in scripts during filming and more credit on and 
off screen for their work 
the guild has signed other contracts with about 80 independent 
producers but the alliance maintains none of its larger members 
have signed and that the producers who did defect employ only a tiny 
fraction of the 3000 active writers

a strong earthquake triggered 
landslides shattered windows and caused power blackouts in the 
lower half of new zealands south island on saturday officials said 
the quake measured 65 on the richter scale but damage was 
limited because the quake was centered on the sparselypopulated 
area of lake te anau north of the town of invercargill officials 
said 
there were no immedate reports of injuries 
murray lowry of the wellington seismological observatory said 
sunday that aftershocks could be expected to continue for as long as 
a month 
the richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 60 on the richter scale can cause severe damage 
and a 70 reading is a major earthquake capable of widespread 
heavy damage

israels supreme court on sunday upheld a 
government decision to deport arabamerican mubarak awad an 
advocate of civil disobedience toward israeli rule in the occupied 
territories 
the court said it will delay the deportation until next sunday 
apparently to give awad time to appear in court for a civil libel 
suit against the israeli daily maariv 
awad 44 responded to the ruling by saying i am not 
disappointed i will continue to fight for a palestinian state 
wherever i am 
the decison by the threejudge panel was read in a 10minute 
session only hours before us secretary of state george p shultz 
who protested the deportation order was due to arrive in israel to 
pursue a peace initiative 
prime minister yitzhak shamir ordered awad deported may 6 after 
the arabamerican was arrested the previous day and accused of 
playing a role in inciting the sixmonthold arab uprising in the 
occupied territories 
the jerusalemborn awad who also has a home in wapakoneta ohio 
has denied the charges 
awad describes himself as an adherent of the late indian leader 
mohandas k ghandis philosophy of civil disobedience he has 
authored a widelycirculated pamphlet called nonviolent 
resistance a strategy for the occupied territories 
in a statement from jail after he was ordered deported awad 
said for prime minister shamir to say that i a christian will 
be forever prevented from returning to my city of jerusalem to pray 
in my holy places is totally unacceptable 
awad was born in jerusalem when the city was ruled by neighboring 
jordan his appeal against the deportation was considered by his 
lawyers to be a test case for the status of palestinians under 
israeli rule in the city 
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing the sector of the 
city from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
israels grounds for deportation was that awad failed to renew a 
tourist visa that expired last year awads attorneys jonathan 
kuttab and avraham gal contended he did not need a visa and should 
be allowed permanent residence because he was born in jerusalem 
in issuing the deportation order shamirs spokesman avi pazner 
accused awad on may 7th of helping to compile a series of leaflets 
urging palestinians to throw stones and firebombs at israeli targets 
according to un figures 201 palestinians have been killed in 
the uprising three israelis have also died 
awads americanborn wife nancy nye responded by telling 
reporters last month that her husband was committed to nonviolence 
but also to the intefadeh which is arabic for uprising 
she said awad supported measures such as merchant strikes and 
boycotts of israeli goods which matched awads philosophy of civil 
disobedience 
awads israeli lawyer avraham gal won court approval to delay his 
clients deportation pending another hearing in a 100000 libel 
suit 
in the suit filed last week awad challenged maariv for claiming 
in an article on may 13 that he dealt in drugs and channeled the 
proceeds to the palestine liberation organization

the halfbrother of democratic presidential 
candidate jesse jackson was arrested in greenville sc and 
charged with hiring someone to attack a murder witness police said 
sunday 
noah robinson 45 was arrested late saturday night and charged 
with being an accessory to a felony obstruction of justice 
intimidating a witness and criminal conspiracy according to 
greenville police detective keith morton 
morton said robinson a small businessman in greenville who has 
also worked in chicago is suspected of hiring someone who slashed 
and stabbed a woman who was a witness to the executionstyle murder 
of a man who had worked for robinson 
we think he was responsible for the solicitation of the act and 
took part in the arranging said morton 
robinson who gave police a home address in chicago and jackson 
have the same father jackson who has spoken frequently on the 
campaign trail of his beginnings was born out of wedlock to a woman 
who had an affair with the candidates father who was married at 
the time 
jackson and robinson have had a chaotic relationship over the 
years at times working together but also quarreling and staying 
apart 
jackson had robinson take control of the federally funded 
breadbasket commercial association inc an arm of jacksons civil 
rights group operation push that helped minority firms bid for 
public contracts 
but jackson was quoted as saying in 1987 when robinson was 
reportedly being investigated for allegedly violating federal 
bankruptcy laws i have no connection with him 
bob borosage a jackson campaign spokesman declined to comment 
early sunday 
a duty officer at the greenville sc detention center said 
robinson was being held sunday in lieu of 100000 bond although 
morton said prosecutors planned to seek a higher bond 
the warrant filed late saturday charges that robinson did 
advise counsel urge encourage or otherwise aid a codefendant in 
the commission of a felony assault and battery with intent to kill 
and later rendered assistance to the codefendant in absconding 
the jurisdiction 
a man turned charged with assault and battery with intent to kill 
in the attack turned himself in to authorities in january according 
to the greenville news 
morton said robinson was arrested after statements from 
codefendants and that more arrests are expected 
according to morton janice denice rosemond was stabbed 
repeatedly in december 1987 after she had testified before a grand 
jury in chicago about the slaying of leroy barber 
barber was shot to death in january 1986 outside a plaza in 
greenville robinson owns 
from what we understand there had been several altercations 
over the years between barber and robinson he had been working for 
robinson in chicago and come back to greenville said morton 
theyd gotten into a fight a couple of weeks before barber was 
shot 
morton said barber was shot once in the head by an unidentified 
assailant and rosemond unfortunately was a witness to that 
no one has been charged with the barber slaying said morton

secretary of state george p shultz on sunday 
urged israel to end its occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
and restore rights to palestinians 
now is the time for further progress toward peace shultz 
said at ben gurion international airport near tel aviv after he 
arrived for a sevenhour visit to pursue his middle east peace 
initiative 
the continued occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and 
the frustration of palestinian rights is a dead end to continue it 
is an illusion shultz said 
the united states has put forward a plan for negotiations no 
party has the luxury to turn aside a chance to negotiate 
israel seized the west bank and gaza strip during the 1967 middle 
east war since antioccupation unrest broke out in the occupied 
lands on dec 8 israeli soldiers have killed more than 200 
palestinians two israelis have been killed 
israeli foreign minister shimon peres greeted shultz we look 
upon you as a man with a message a man who carries a message of 
peace to all of us he said 
peres said there was a choice between the continued arms race 
fanatacism fundamentalism and other manifestations of extremism and 
the tough decision required to block this trend and to offer the 
middle east arabs and jews alike a different future 
before shultz arrived peres who heads the leftist labor party 
told israel radio i will do all i can to advance the peace 
process lets say the peace process dies then whats the 
alternative 
prime minister yitzhak shamir however who objects to parts of 
shultzs plan told israel radio saturday he does not expect a 
breakthrough 
shamir who heads the rightwing likud bloc objects to trading 
land for peace he also opposes a proposed international peace 
conference in which western countries would mediate a settlement of 
the arabisraeli conflict

greatly welcomes the visit the efforts mr shultz is making to 
advance the peace process 
ahimeir also said shamir will will raise israels concern about 
the use of chemical weapons by arab states and their newlypurchased 
mediumrange missiles 
he shamir feels that the whole free world should raise its 
voice against the use of these weapons by arab states ahimeir 
said 
shultz is also expected to report to israeli leaders on moscow 
summit last week and the talks he held in cairo israeli officials 
said 
peres told israel radio he was encouraged by changes he said he 
has detected in the kremlins approach to the middle east 
the soviet union broke diplomatic ties with israel during the 
1967 war but gradually has resumed contacts over the last two years 
after the moscow summit soviet leader mikhail gorbachev also 
said he would consider regularizing ties with israel once an 
international conference was underway 
in the past the soviet union has been mostly a weapons supplier 
to the middle east peres said now they the soviets support 
compromise this is a real change

libya on sunday denounced the united states for 
saying that groups supported by libya were suspected in recent 
attacks against americans and us facilities around the world 
the official jana news agency monitored in rome said the 
allegations were made to undermine libya hinder arab unity and 
force libya to retreat from its support of the massive popular 
revolution in occupied palestine 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in washington on 
friday that groups that have received support from libya were the 
prime suspects in recent attacks against us and western 
european interests in europe latin american and africa 
she did not accuse libya directly but said suspicion of its 
continued support of terrorism was accompanied by concrete 
evidence 
mrs oakley referred to the seizure last november in france of a 
shipment of libyan weapons allegedly intended for the outlawed irish 
republican army she also cited reports that suspected libyan agents 
were arrested carrying bombmaking materials in senegal in february 
jana said the statements affirm again the us governments 
reliance on the language of threat in international dealings 
we interpret this new threat by the us administration against 
libya as a start of aggression without any justification but 
hatred and the spirit of domination and racism it said 
for years libya has been one of a few nations identified by the 
state department as sponsors of terrorist groups the reagan 
administration has accused libyan leader moammar gadhafi of 
fomenting terrorism 
in april 1986 us warplanes attacked his personal living 
quarters in tripoli he was not hit 
around the second anniversary of the attack there were several 
terrorist attacks on installations and clubs owned or frequented by 
americans 
among the targets hit this year were us information agency 
offices in costa rica colombia and peru and a club frequented by 
american servicemen in naples italy 
five people were killed in the naples attack two americans were 
wounded in an attack on a club in khartoum sudan last month and 
the office of a us bank in new delhi was also targeted

communist rebels ambushed a platoon 
of soldiers trying to retrieve a hijacked truck sunday killing 16 
and wounding eight in one of the bloodiest rebel attacks this year 
officials said 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
troops managed to fight back and killed an undetermined number of 
rebels during the hourlong battle on an isolated mountain road 
foreign minister raul manglapus charged that unidentified 
european governments were indirectly financing communist rebels 
manglapus made the accusation on the third day of a conference among 
representatives of 13 asian european and latin american countries 
that have won their freedom from dictators 
a sketchy military report said 24 soldiers and militiamen were 
traveling on foot when they came under fire from an unknown number 
of new peoples army guerrillas outside silay city 300 miles 
southeast of manila and about 25 miles from bacalod 
the rebels fled when more troops backed by helicopter gunships 
and armored personnel carriers arrived the report said 
residents of nearby villages evacuated their homes as troops 
continued to hunt the rebels after the battle which began at 2 
pm the officials said 
local radio reports said the ambushed soldiers were on their way 
to retrieve a truck loaded with fertilizer that rebels abandoned 
after hijacking it saturday night the truck belonged to one of the 
biggest sugar producing companies on negros island 
the new peoples army is one of 12 marxist groups that have been 
waging a 19year insurgency in the philippines 
the national democratic front is the umbrella organization for 
the groups the philippine military estimates that the front 
received 15 million in aid last year from groups in europe the 
united states japan australia and new zealand 
manglapus said foreign aid to the rebels came from 
nongovernmental organizations but noted that such groups in europe 
are subsidized by some governments 
this of course is practically an official flow of money and 
our armed forces and intelligence agencies tell us that this takes 
place regularly in a systematic manner manglapus said 
he said he has filed formal protests with the european 
governments concerned but did not identify any of them he said he 
has not raised the matter with the us japanese australian and 
new zealand governments but did not say why 
earlier greeces representative in the conference denied claims 
by the national democratic front that greeces governing panhellenic 
socialist party was among its supporters 
we have nothing in common with insurgents and therefore we 
deplore such cheap and shameless lies said george lianis 
greeces ambassador to japan 
other countries attending the conference were portugal uruguay 
honduras ecuador peru brazil el salvador nicaragua spain 
argentina and the dominican republic 
south korea the united states norway switzerland and were 
represented as observers

raymond riha jr was worth between 6 
million and 10 million before he was 45 had a successful company 
owned property in alabama and florida drove expensive cars and was 
married with two children 
that life collapsed in less than two years after he began smoking 
cocaine 
he recently pleaded guilty to two cocaine trafficking charges and 
one possession charge and was sentenced to 15 years on each a 
hearing is scheduled june 17 to determine how much of the sentence 
must be served behind bars he also awaits trial on a fourth charge 
during a recent series of interviews at the jefferson county 
jail riha 45 told the birmingham postherald about his downfall 
that pipe that person that thing in my hand it was very much 
alive it was a living thing to me riha said i talked to it 
and it answered me it came back with positiveplus reactions and 
answers and made me work everything out in my mind it lies all the 
time 
his personal net worth is down to 100000 by some estimates the 
company he founded in pelham southern resistance welding which 
grossed about 6 million a year and employed 25 people is bankrupt 
he says he had never used any kind of drug until one day in 
october 1986 when he walked into the home of a friend and walked out 
about 12 hours later hooked on cocaine 
i said what is this there is no such thing on earth that 
could do that to me that could take control of me riha said i 
took the pipe and smoked it so nonchalantly that first time 
the drug relaxed him all my worries disappeared he said 
he had plenty of money and plenty of time and gave himself over 
to binge after binge 
it is not unusual for a person to lose everything they have 
said dr joe rice clinical director of the university of alabama at 
birmingham center for health professionals in chelsea the unusual 
situation here is that this individual had so much to lose 
the drug interfered with rihas closest interests 
a horseracing fan from his childhood in cleveland he was one of 
the first to invest in the new birmingham turf club purchasing 
1000 shares of stock and 51 limited partnerships he signed up his 
company to rent of one of the prestigious boxes at 25000 a year 
but when the horse track opened march 3 1987 it took 
everything i could muster to get there he said i almost didnt 
make it through the evening and i found myself leaving to go to my 
car between the races to hit the pipe 
he fulfilled another lifelong dream by investing about 400000 
to put together a dragster and crew but when the car was ready to 
race in january 1987 it held no interest and riha only made it to a 
few races 
its amazing how the drug can take your interest in everything 
away from hobbies to your business sex love everything and 
replace it with itself said riha 
riha was arrested on drug charges twice but returned to cocaine 
use late last year after a month in a rehabilitation program 
on christmas day last year riha said i sat there looking at 
bankruptcy papers the suit my father filed against me for the 
400000 i had borrowed from him over the years divorce papers that 
never went through and the criminal charges well merry christmas 
ray i said but at least i had my pipe there too 
later he was arrested for allegedly giving cocaine to a minor 
the 17yearold daughter of his mistress he said she took it from 
him she testified she was working for the police and that he gave 
her cocaine when she asked for it 
i dont think i was meant to go sit in prison riha said i 
didnt go through all this to end this way

juggling careers ambition marriage and a home life 
olin who plays the brooding analytical philadelphia adman 
michael steadman and wettig his reallife wife who plays the wife 
of steadmans partner elliott both admit in the june 11 issue of tv 
guide that active acting careers cause other aspects of their lives 
to suffer at times 
youve got kids and a marriage and work all at the same 
time said wettig from my perspective all three things are 
extremely important and im not willing to give up any of them but 
i find at different times one is always suffering 
sometimes i feel like im in competition with her work olin 
said its like being in competition with the children im 
competitive for her attention

palestinian merchants struggling for financial 
survival in the occupied lands face threats from both sides in the 
arab uprising a fact driven home during secretary of state george 
p shultzs visit 
underground leaders of the uprising threaten to burn arab stores 
if they dont observe general strikes such as the threeday work 
stoppage ordered to protest shultzs visit to israel on sunday 
at the same time the israeli government uses taxes as one of its 
major weapons for fighting the uprising 
if i open they will burn it said grocer sahli sagari 43 
standing outside his shop in east jerusalem 
sagari already has tasted the other side of the equation 
in may he and 13 other merchants on the street of the prophets 
opened at the specific hours ordered by uprising leaders they were 
shut down by israeli police and charged with violating laws that 
could mean two years in prison they now await trial 
merchants say the government drive to enforce tax payments 
ordered boycotted by uprising leaders has disrupted some 
businesses and forced others to close 
theres no way any company can clear anything unless all taxes 
are paid said serop t ohannessian general manager of a paper 
factory in ramallah 
a tax receipt must be shown for a marriage license or a birth 
certificate merchants say they need to produce such receipts for 
everything from export and import licenses to trucks and machinery 
tanus abu aitah has shut his jordan plastics company near 
bethlehem which employed about 300 workers he complained he was 
caught between the palestinian strikes which cut his production 
and the governments tax demands 
i am losing my customers because im not producing all their 
needs he said as for the taxes i have to pay them whether we 
are working fulltime or not if i dont pay i will be arrested 
the best solution is to close the factory 
israeli officials say some arab merchants have begged the army to 
force shops to open to relieve merchants of the threat of revenge 
from young men behind the uprising or the palestine liberation 
organization 
but most merchants say they back the uprisings goal of ending 
the israeli occupation of the gaza strip and the west bank which 
israel captured from egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the merchants also dont want to lose customers who are making 
sacrifices for the uprising 
ohannessian the paper products man said he has closed his 
entire plastic diaper line laying off about 70 of his 150 workers 
because of another problem 
while israelis are stopping his trucks from reaching the gaza 
strip during the uprising israeli manufacturers are shipping paper 
diapers to the west bank under arabsounding product names he said 
what has happened is were completely encircled he said 
they israeli competitors can extend credit to stores at a time 
when i have to ask for payment right away 
in the west bank town of hebron the owner of a food products 
factory who gave his name only as abed said merchants trying to 
bring goods into israel also run into tax collectors at army 
checkpoints 
they stop any truck without a tax receipt then they confiscate 
the product and the truck he said 
he said hebrons merchants fear youths who have burned cars and 
shops after owners were accused of breaking the strike 
in the hillside haret alsheikh section of hebron a group of 
young men explained that it was rarely necessary to burn anything to 
persuade people to strike 
first we send them a threatening letter said one of the 
seven or eight present if that doesnt work we throw a molotov 
at the wall around their house then set a tire on fire outside the 
fourth step is to burn shops and cars 
some merchants find a way around orders in the underground 
uprisings leaflets such as the one that requires palestinian 
businesses to open only in the mornings 
jamal tawil 26 keeps his east jerusalem supermarket shuttered 
each afternoon but cut a hole in the wall from his adjacent house 
so customers can enter the store unnoticed 
but even tawil closes up the hole during general strikes 
i dont want to lose the business he said

national rifle association political chief 
wayne lapierre makes frequent visits to capitol hill but his 
meeting with democratic sen j james exon on may 27 was anything 
but routine 
the nra long considered one of washingtons most influential 
lobbying organizations never apologizes for the harsh attacks it 
makes on lawmakers opposing its positions but here was lapierre 
according to exons recollection admitting the group had gone too 
far in attacking a senator who has been a longtime supporter of gun 
owners 
i think their influence has deteriorated some said exon and 
the conservative nebraskans view is shared by the nras traditional 
opponents like handgun control inc and nras more recent 
antagonists the nations major law enforcement organizations 
exon who parted with the organization over a bill to ban plastic 
guns that could escape detection at airport metal detectors said 
that what he saw as lapierres apologetic tone reinforced his 
conclusion 
but lapierre director of the nras institute for legislative 
action denies his comments to exon amounted to an apology and 
rejects any view that the progun group has lost a step 
our base is as good as gold lapierre says were going to 
be in good shape as long as there are 70 million americans who own 
guns and 25 million who hunt there are 70 senators and 260 house 
members who have never voted against us 
but exon described a different mood they indicated to me they 
had fallen down badly in communications they said they were going 
to do everything they could to remedy that they said they may have 
overreacted in the type of advertising and letterwriting to my 
constituents 
while exon believes the nra has lost influence by attacking its 
friends the groups political opponents cite other reasons for 
their view among them 
the nras switch from opposition to support of a bill to ban 
undetectable plastic guns legislation that is a top priority of gun 
control and police groups and is sponsored by nra nemesis sen 
howard m metzenbaum dohio 
the nra changed its mind after police groups successfully lobbied 
attorney general edwin meese iii to support their version of the 
measure 
lapierre says the nra switched only after new language made clear 
the bill would ban only still nonexistent plastic handguns not 
existing metal pistols a victory for the nra lapierre says 
a stunning gun control triumph in maryland where gov william 
donald schaefer in a ceremony with some 200 police officers signed 
a bill may 27 to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as saturday 
night specials 
lapierre said the nras supporters have begun an effort 
successful in its early stages to place a repeal referendum on the 
ballot 
the minnesota senate judiciary committees defeat of an 
nrabacked constitutional amendment proposal to clarify the right to 
keep and bear arms also the failure of the nra in wisconsin to win 
passage of legislation that would have prohibited local governments 
from passing any gun control law stricter than state law 
lapierre contends that state legislatures passed 18 nrabacked 
bills in 1986 24 last year and 13 so far this year theres only 
one gun control bill thats gone through and thats in maryland 
he says it was our agenda being discussed in state legislatures 
not the other sides 
in the 1986 congressional elections not a single incumbent 
targeted for defeat by the nra lost his or her seat 
lapierre its very tough to defeat incumbents in congress 
these days most members of congress who vote for gun control are in 
safe districts and nobodys going to beat them there are few 
competitive districts left where the gun issue is the major 
issue 
in recent congressional battles and numerous state gun control 
fights the nra and the organized police groups have clashed 
bitterly this has given state lawmakers and members of congress a 
political escape hatch allowing them to oppose the nra by 
supporting their local police 
i dont see their relationship with police as ever being very 
good again says jerald vaughn executive director of the 
international association of chiefs of police 
lapierre says he held meetings recently with three or four 
members of congress people who we felt were confused over the 
early version of the plastic gun bill theyre still friends of 
the nra 
lapierres view of his meeting with exon i view it as 
informational if information is fencemending and fencemending is 
information i guess you could interchange them 
vaughn says of the nra they are by no means out of the 
picture but there are signs their stranglehold on this 
administration and congress is starting to loosen a bit theres a 
growing recognition in law enforcement the nra is an organization 
out of control but politically theyre a savvy organization they 
make sure theyre never in a position of having to admit defeat 
nt pete shields chairman of handgun control inc says the 
entry of law enforcement groups into the fray has been crucial 
the nra used to call us bleedingheart communists soft on 
criminals shields says now whole law enforcement community 
the guys on the firing line on the street is behind it the fight 
to control guns its not credible to think of those people as 
bleedingheart liberal communists

republican senate candidates increasingly 
concerned about political fallout from edwin meeses legal problems 
are beginning to call on the attorney general to leave president 
reagans cabinet 
at least four gop candidates have urged meese to resign and 
others have hinted they would like to see him go 
leading republicans such as vice president george bush and white 
house staff chief howard h baker jr have conceded meeses troubles 
could severely damage gop prospects this election year but the 
attorney general has insisted he has done nothing wrong and will 
remain in office until he can set the record straight 
independent counsel james mckay is expected to issue his report 
this month on meeses conduct sources familiar with the probe said 
the report would not recommend an indictment but would raise 
questions about meeses ethical conduct 
in recent interviews meese has refused to say when he might leave 
office but has ruled out a departure before his name is cleared 
because people would say there was something wrong 
meeses strongest defender in the administration is reagan who 
has said that only a complete change of meeses character 
would prompt him to ask his old friend to resign 
however that view is not shared by many republicans involved in 
tough election campaigns 
bush said he met early last month with meese and the attorney 
general assured him he would do nothing to jeopardize the vice 
presidents presidential campaign 
in a recent interview bush also said that meese has been made 
aware by the polls and by a lot of public comment that there is the 
danger that this matter if it stays exactly the way it is could 
not only adversely affect me but others as well 
during a recent television interview baker acknowledge bushs 
discomfort 
its a difficult situation he said on the nbc show meet 
the press its an unfortunate situation its one that 
obviously troubles the vice president but in the final analysis 
the only person who can make a judgment on this is the president of 
the united states and the president has expressed his continued 
confidence in the attorney general 
pete dawkins battling to oust democratic sen frank lautenberg 
of new jersey told a college commencement audience recently i 
believe ed meese should step down as our nations leading law 
enforcement officer 
mayor george voinovich of cleveland the republican challenger 
trying to unseat democratic sen howard metzenbaum of ohio recently 
declared that for the good of the country the president the 
justice department and the republican party mr meese should 
resign 
if mr meese ever had any use to the administration it has 
long since passed he ought to go said slade gorton the 
former republican senator trying to capture the seat being vacated 
by sen dan evans rwash 
a fourth gop senate candidate bill anderson who is running 
against democratic sen jim sasser of tennessee recently wrote 
meese to say i urge you to step aside and resign as attorney 
general to enhance the credibility of that office as well as the 
credibility of the presidency 
several republican senators have stopped barely short of outright 
calls for meese to resign 
sen david karnes of nebraska fighting a challenge from 
democratic former gov robert kerry recently said he did not think 
meese was a factor in his race but then he added im not going 
to be writing any letters saying please stay 
typical of one approach was that of sen john chafee rri when 
asked about meese the senator who is up for reelection said he 
believes it is up to the president to decide but then adds that he 
thinks reagan might be better served by someone else 
sen john heinz rpa has said he expected mckay to issue a 
very serious and condemnatory report in that case he said if 
meese didnt resign the report would go to the office of 
professional responsibility which the senator described as a very 
tough office heinz said he anticipated that office would 
recommend that meese either resign or be fired by the president

an environmental leader 
and a western politician have taken up the cause of the wolf 
calling for its return to the wilds of the nations first national 
park 
they added their voices saturday to that of the head of the 
national park service who said that the howl of the wolf is the 
call the music of the west 
lined up in opposition are the majority of cattlemen and sheepmen 
in the west backed by wymonings two us senators and one 
representative 
speaking at the annual meeting of the greater yellowstone 
coalition rep wayne owens dutah and m rupert cutler president 
of the defenders of wildlife urged national support for restoration 
of the wolf to yellowstone national park 
the coalition formed in 1983 consists of about 50 national 
regional and local organizations that monitor management of the 25 
millionacre park 
nearly all of americas wolf population was wiped out earlier 
this century by ranchers farmers and bounty hunters there have 
been a few sightings of lone wolves in a few western states a pack 
of wolves migrated across the canadian border into glacier national 
park two years ago but left this year to go back into british 
columbia 
efforts to revive the wolf population in minnesota have resulted 
in about 1200 wolves there efforts to restart the red wolf 
population in virginia and mexican wolf colonies in the southwest 
also are under way 
noting that the reintroduction of the gray wolf into yellowstone 
is endorsed by the national park service owens said i am always 
offended when we politicians substitute our own value judgments for 
those of professional land managers 
there is a theory among the wyoming and montana congressional 
delegations that they own yellowstone said owens 
owens said he introduced a bill in congress after discovering in 
yellowstone park last fall that the wolf recovery program had been 
completely sidetracked by political interference 
the bill would order the interior department to implement the 
rocky mountain wolf recovery plan drawn up by the us fish and 
wildlife service it would reestablish wolves in the entire 
northern rocky mountain region including yellowstone 
it was clear to me when i introduced the bill that i could not 
pass it said owens but i hoped to expose the wolf to daylight 
there is no predation problem with wolves it is psychological the 
hatred of wolves 
cutler whose 80000member organization has reintroduction of 
wolves into yellowstone as a top priority said all americans 
have a right to influence the course of events in yellowstone 
national park 
cutler said restoring the wolves has enormous symbolic 
importance as well as ecological importance it will be viewed 
as one of the major conservation accomplishments of the 1990s 
park service director william penn mott said friday in an 
interview with the associated press that he believes the 
reintroduction is inevitable 
when that happens people may never see a wolf said mott 
but they will hear them howl that is the call the music of the 
west that quality is as important as a natural presence or a 
structure within a park 
cutler and owens urged the 300 people attending saturdays 
meeting to rally support to force congress to hold hearings on the 
wolf reintroduction plan 
cutler said the next step would be an environmental impact 
statement on the proposal he said a requested 200000 federal 
appropriation is in danger of failing to get through the budget 
review process

sothebys international after 73 chinese and western works of 
modern art and rare objects brought in a total of 176 million yuan 
or about 475850

democrat michael dukakis could find himself 
depicted as far to the left on critical questions of defense and 
military strength in the fall race for the white house 
his opposition to many weapons systems already has drawn fire 
both from republicans and within his own party 
dukakis rejecting characterizations of him as naive and 
reluctant in the use of american power says he wants to enhance 
us conventional forces while keeping defense spending stable and 
wants to rely on the cooperation of allies in cases of potential 
international threats 
the likely democratic presidential nominee does not shrink from a 
foreign policy debate with the expected republican nominee george 
bush he already has begun attacking him on the administrations 
irancontra affair and central america policy 
but while nationwide surveys give dukakis an edge over bush the 
one area in which voters continue to place more confidence in the 
republicans than the democrats is military strength and dealing with 
the soviets 
its clearly an issue thats there to be exploited said 
norman ornstein a political analyst at the conservative american 
enterprise institute i think this is potentially the soft 
underbelly of dukakis 
will marshall is issues director for the democratic leadership 
council a group of defenseminded democrats led by georgia sen sam 
nunn and others marshall said dukakis attitude on foreign affairs 
questions gives some democrats concern about dukakis ability to 
project resolve and a willingness to intervene unilaterally if 
necessary 
his strong stand on europe and conventional forces makes him 
obviously not a george mcgovern not an isolationist marshall 
said 
but on third world regional conflicts and latin america he 
tends to strike a very legalistic moralistic posture that raises 
questions about what is the best way to protect our national 
interests and support the spread of democracy 
bush has portrayed dukakis views on defense as akin to those of 
mcgovern the democrats 1972 peace candidate who lost in a 
landslide 
even jimmy carter and walter mondale supported weapons 
systems that governor dukakis opposes bush said the governors 
views are naive at best and if implemented would be dangerous to 
the defense of this country 
dukakis and his campaign parry the issue back at the vice 
president 
we feel strongly said dukakis communications director leslie 
dach that the real vulnerabilities on foreign policy are on the 
republican side theyve got to explain away panamanian leader 
manuel antonio noriega irancontra and a failed and unpopular 
policy in central america 
jesse jackson dukakis only remaining democratic rival has 
accused dukakis of avoiding specifics on many issues but it is on 
defense systems where the two may be closest with jackson also 
opposing major new weapons systems and calling for cuts in the star 
wars nuclear defense program 
dukakis held a meeting on defense issues last fall with a group 
of democratic defense specialists including veterans of past 
administrations and thinktank experts 
one participant speaking only on condition he not be named said 
dukakis and the experts didnt seem to connect 
there was certainly a kind of ships passing in the night 
feature to it to put it mildly this democratic defense 
specialist said 
he said dukakis remarks generated concern about an idealistic 
view of rule of law in foreign policy that although the personal 
styles and attitudes and demeanor are very different that hes 
really very similar to jimmy carter i think thats what people are 
worried about 
not everyone who attended the meeting felt that way some have 
come to be dukakis campaign advisers 
he seemed to be open minded to be willing to listen but not 
to be terribly familiar with the issues said robert komer a 
former undersecretary of defense who is now a consultant at the rand 
corp 
dukakis has focused on beefing up the us conventional military 
forces taking a page from the book of nunn dukakis wants to 
enhance air and sea support and supplies such as ammunition for 
us troops said madeleine albright georgetown university 
professor of international relations and dukakis senior foreign 
policy adviser 
he believes some targeted new investments are necessary but 
will not estimate their price she said he does not call for cuts 
in overall defense spending but would keep the pentagon budget 
stable for several years financing his projects from cuts in 
star wars and other systems she said 
however speaking to senior citizens in massachusetts in midmay 
dukakis suggested services for the elderly could be paid for from 
military cutbacks 
are we going to spend 6 billion on star wars and mx missiles 
on railroad cars or are we going to build affordable housing for 
families of low and moderate income and the elderly he asked 
dukakis opposes both the mx and midgetman missile systems and is 
against plans to add two more aircraft carriers and the support 
ships that go with them although it is too late to stop the b1 
bomber program dukakis would not favor buying more b1s if elected 
said christopher edley jr issues director for the dukakis campaign 
his point is we cant buy everything in the defense candy 
store edley said that we have to make choices that really do 
advance our essential security needs and he would emphasize our 
conventional strength 
ultimately individual weapons systems may prove less important 
in shaping voters judgments than feelings about the candidates 
resolve and strength 
i think theres some real unease out there about where dukakis 
would draw the line in the dust ornstein said 
in both the middle east and central america dukakis cites the 
need for agreement among other nations to stop hostilities 
theres a feeling governor dukakis places too great a store in 
the possibility of solving all conflicts through negotiated 
settlement marshall said 
he needs to reassure people that although a dukakis 
administration would be very vigorous and dogged in its exploration 
of diplomatic avenues for achieving our national interests in the 
final analysis hes willing to act decisively to protect our crucial 
interests

left 35000 customers in six western chicago suburbs without service 
for varying lengths of time the great phone outage came to a quiet 
end 
at 1201 am sunday illinois bell officials transferred the 
last 18000 customers from the damaged juryrigged switch to a new 
stateoftheart digital unit with as many as 250 employees often 
working aroundtheclock the company compressed what is normally a 
50week job into less than four weeks 
it was a very good cutover very uneventful said bell 
spokesman dick hill 
thank goodness any more problems and i might have hit the 
roof said mrs hector whose exchange was among the last of six 
to be transferred by bell 
being without a reliable phone is like being without running 
water she said you never realize how important it is until 
its gone 
mrs hector said she had spent much of the month in her car 
running errands she normally would have taken care of by telephone 
i couldnt reach the other mothers in my childrens preschool 
classes for car pooling i couldnt call to make doctors 
appointments for myself and then my own kids got sick she said 
i just started showing up at the doctors offices instead of 
making appointments 
and then when i was home i was anxious because im so far 
along with the pregnancy even so she added i think im 
going to miss some of those times when the phones werent ringing 
off the hook 
not ms jordan 
the phone is my lifeline she said from her downtown hinsdale 
office when it went down so did my livelihood theres only so 
much paperwork to catch up on and thats how i justified the first 
couple of days without the phone 
then i went knocking on doors driving around and leaving 
notes but talk about inefficiencies it was like a different 
country just a few miles from here where peoples phones were 
working 
id come over to show their house and theyd tell me youll 
have to come back later we didnt have a chance to clean why 
didnt you call us and id say no phones and theyd look at me 
funny 
since the mothers day fire phone service had been sporadic at 
best for ms jordan and other bell customers about half were hooked 
up to the new system on may 26 
with the remainder hooked up sunday the utility said things 
should be back to normal 
technically this should be the end of it but there might 
be some little glitches that we will have to work out said bell 
spokeswoman hilary anderson 
although illinois bell promised rebates several businesses were 
angry enough to file lawsuits charging the utility was negligent in 
failing to staff the switching station which houses computerized 
equipment to connect local and longdistance calls firefighters 
reached the scene 82 minutes after an alarm registered at bells 
springfield monitoring station 
and illinois attorney general neil hartigan filed a complaint 
with the illinois commerce commission seeking to have bell pick up 
the tab for financial losses 
but sunday at least bell was savoring its accomplishments in 
returning the area to full service 
we still have a lot of work to do but it wont be the kind of 
feverish work weve been doing said hill it was an 
extraordinary effort by all the people involved

about 80 soviets shouted freedom freedom and 
carried banners through downtown moscow on sunday in an 
unprecedented march to demand the release of political prisoners 
about 50 police officers courteously stopped the protesters from 
advancing to red square but allowed them to gather across from the 
moscow soviet the whitecolumned headquarters of city government 
the afternoon march along gorky street a major thoroughfare that 
leads to the kremlin was the first in the soviet capital in memory 
participants credited kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachevs campaign 
of glasnost or openness on selected topics 
this protest shows how our political freedoms are widening 
today we are making history declared yuri s skubko a member of 
the democratic union a fledgling opposition group 
sweating in the sun the demonstrators gathered near a statue of 
yuri dolgoruky the russian prince who founded moscow and shouted 
in unison freedom freedom for political prisoners 
it was the first time that chanting protesters carrying banners 
marched along a moscow street without police making obvious moves to 
disperse them 
in recent months moscow police have allowed some demonstrations 
to proceed but they sometimes seized banners and detained 
participants 
in december police manhandled a dozen young people who gathered 
outside army headquarters to protest the soviet military role in 
afghanistan 
sundays protest sparked reactions ranging from anger to 
bewilderment from soviets strolling down gorky street one of 
moscows most fashionable shopping avenues 
are they making a movie asked dmitri kuchov 12 
a flushed woman shouted at the marchers this is slander dont 
you see that 
the protesters started at 3 pm at the base of the monument to 
19th century russian poet alexander pushkin hundreds of soviets 
looked on 
different groups called for freedom for armenian nationalist 
paruyr ayrikyan for leaders of crimean tatars who want permission 
for tatars to resettle in their crimean homeland and for political 
prisoners in the country as a whole 
we estimate that there are 300 to 400 of them said viktor 
kuzin 35 a member of the democratic unions central coordinating 
council not all of them are imprisoned under political counts 
but some have been falsely accused and convicted of committing 
common crimes 
a young man climbed a lamppost by the bronze statue of pushkin to 
lead the protesters in a chant calling for ayrikyans release 
demonstrators then marched down the sidewalk on gorky street 
past the central hotel and vendors selling apple juice and flowers 
on their way to red square and the kremlin 
police on the sidewalk across from the moscow soviet blocked them 
after they marched about 500 yards the protesters then gathered at 
the dolgoruky monument 
uniformed police appeared to treat the protesters politely 
please stand over there with your banners one lieutenant told a 
protester after touching him on the shoulder 
at 4 pm the protesters turned around and returned to pushkin 
square a group of armenians then staged another rally outside the 
headquarters of the soviet news agency tass 
ayrikyan 39 was arrested by the kgb secret police in yerevan 
armenias capital on march 25 he is the founder of the union for 
national selfdetermination an armenian nationalist group 
his wife yelena 35 said that ayrikyan who has served 17 years 
in prison labor camp and internal exile for his political 
activities was being held in a kgb isolation cell while charges 
against him were investigated 
on march 19 ayrikyan told a moscow news conference that more 
than 70 people had died in antiarmenian racial riots in the 
azerbaijan city of sumgait on feb 28 
the soviet government said 32 people were killed and mrs 
ayrikyan said her husband had been accused of slandering the soviet 
state 
the riots grew out of ethnic tensions between armenians and 
azerbaijanis armenians have demanded that an armeniandominated 
area of azerbaijan be annexed to their republic 
mrs ayrikyan her eyes red from crying said there were reports 
her husband had a heart attack while in jail but she said officials 
denied her any information about his health 
tass accused the groups of staging a concert for western 
reporters in moscow to cover the 1000th anniversary of the russian 
orthodox church and described akrikyan as a dissident who has 
declared against the policy of the soviet state more than once 
the criminal code of the ussr has no such notion as a 
political prisoner tass said 
it accused extremistminded crimean tatars of calling for the 
release of sinaver kadyrov and rishat ablayev and said they were 
serving time for criminal offenses that have nothing to do with 
human rights 
the tatars deported by dictator josef v stalin as alleged 
wartime collaborators with the germans have been petitioning for 
years for the right to return to their crimean homeland

their likeness is everywhere on the city flag 
and the sides of city vehicles on the uniforms of police officers 
firefighters and city workers by law they have the rightofway on 
any street 
welcome to olney home of the white squirrels the only town 
in the united states to boast a large colony of wild albino 
squirrels 
its our mark of distinction to put it bluntly said mayor 
gail lathrop theyre so darn cute 
a lot of tourists course we dont get a lot being in the 
middle of nowhere stop by the park to see the squirrels said 
mike belcher supervisor of public works in the town of 9000 in 
southeastern illinois 
this is olneys only chance for their claim to fame said 
belcher whose uniform also sports a whitesquirrel emblem on the 
sleeve 
the squirrel also appears on the key to the city and on a rotary 
club sign in the mayors office theres a stuffed white squirrel on 
the wall of the city council chamber 
to protect the citys 150 squirrels olney enacted an ordinance 
in 1925 that gave the animals with white fur white skin and pink 
eyes mutations from gray squirrels the rightofway on any 
street 
should a motorist break the law and kill one he faces a 25 
fine ditto for taking one out of town 
the city goes crazy over them belcher said 
john stencel a local zoologist said the white squirrels have 
inhabited olney since the early 1900s 
he said colonies of albino squirrels which he described as 
groups of about 25 are rare other states including minnesota and 
tennessee do have them he said but none are the size of olneys 
its one of those things that you claim it and let somebody 
else prove us wrong stencel said 
the squirrels thrive because in addition to being protected by 
law people feed them 
on a recent day a handful of townspeople sat around the city 
park waiting to give them a meal 
only three appeared belcher explained that during the summer 
when the temperature is high and people splatter about the nearby 
city pool the squirrels stay in their hollow trees 
i think theyre wonderful said jo ann wiggins who had 
packed apples for the squirrels theyre our pride 
marcia hoagland brought her 2yearold nephew robbie wallace to 
see the white squirrels though she forgot a bag of peanuts at home 
said the mayor you really cant appreciate these little 
animals until you see them

a yale alumnus was charged with arson 
sunday for allegedly torching makeshift shanties on the ivy league 
campus that were built by students to protest south african 
apartheid authorities said 
dr elwood d bracey 56 of west palm beach fla who 
apparently was visiting the university for alumni weekend was 
stopped by a jogger near the blazing shanties police said he was 
released on 50000 bond pending a monday court appearance police 
said 
dr michael l charney a boston psychiatrist and class of 1968 
said he saw a man running away from the fire as he was jogging 
across the campus sunday morning 
i yelled fire and ran after him said charney he was in a 
tan suit tie and his class button which he took off as he ran 
charney said he caught up with the man in the courtyard of one of 
yales residential colleges where the two had a political 
discussion about south africa apartheid and yales investment 
policies 
in my opinion he acknowledged he had done it and he did it 
because he had strong feelings on this and felt alumni should have 
their say charney said he also said he had given yale a lot of 
money 
the man told him he had worked in a hospital in south africa for 
three months charney said 
yale president benno c schmidt jr who had defended the 
universitys decision to allow the shantytown to remain standing 
during a meeting saturday with visiting alumni denounced the arson 
as a lawless act of violence 
to destroy them by an act of impulse is the antithesis of 
reason and order that is the essence of a university or any 
civilized community he said in a statement beyond that to set 
the shanties on fire furtively in the midst of an urban campus is an 
extremely dangerous thing to do 
all that remained standing after the fire was a wooden shrine 
draped in the yellow green and black colors of the outlawed african 
national congress and pasted with sheets of paper listing the names 
of 250 people who have been killed in the struggle against apartheid 
it was a cowardly thing to do said michael morand a 1987 
yale graduate who helped build the shanties as a member of the 
coalition against apartheid and now works in the university 
chaplains office 
the shanties were erected in front of the yale administration 
building in april 1986 to protest apartheid and yale investment 
policies in south africa officials ordered the shanties dismantled 
but allowed them to be rebuilt after students agreed to maintain 
them 
yale owns stock only in companies doing business in south africa 
that subscribe to the sullivan principles a set of ethical 
guidelines aimed at improving the lives of south african blacks and 
ultimately at dismantling apartheid south africas policy of racial 
separation 
walter littell a university spokesman was unsure how much of 
yales stock portfolio was invested in companies doing business in 
south africa as of 1986 yale had about 385 million invested in 
such companies

the missing second act of an opera by italian 
composer gaetano donizetti has been found in the cellar of the royal 
opera house four years after an american musicologist discovered 
its first and third acts there the sunday times reported 
the lost portion of the threeact elisabeth was discovered 
last week by australian conductor richard bonynge he is currently 
leading his wife dame joan sutherland in a production of 
donizettis anna bolena at the royal opera house at covent 
garden 
the times quoted him as saying he made the discovery absolutely 
by chance in an old stack of ballet rubbish music 
donizetti who was born in 1797 and died in 1848 composed the 
work in 1838 the opera set in russia tells the story of a young 
womans walk from siberia to moscow to try to win her fathers 
freedom from exile 
elisabeth first surfaced four years ago when will 
crutchfield an american musicologist found the first and third 
acts it isnt known how the score of the music got to covent garden 
the fact that the pages are singed indicates it may have been 
near a fire possibly one that broke out at the opera house in 1856 
or one 11 years later at her majestys theater to which donizetti 
had unsuccessfully offered the work 
we are now looking for the first possible opportunity to bring 
this opera before the ublic it will probably be within 18 months 
and initially in a concert version said paul findlay the 
director of covent garden

with lots of milk and corn flakes 
battle creek retained its title as the breakfast capital of the 
country by serving 32697 people and beating the record set by 
springfield mass 
it was the third straight year that the city beat the 
massachusetts town for the bragging rights 
we placed 35076 servings of cereal on the mall and 2379 were 
returned for a total of 32697 which leaves battle creek the 
breakfast capital of the world breakfast table chairman rick 
royal said saturday 
battle creek home of kellogg co and springfield have swapped 
claims to putting out the largest breakfast since 1977 
on may 14 springfield regained the title by feeding 31279 
people a pancake breakfast during its annual celebration of the 
founding of the city 
congratulations to battle creek for topping us again william 
sullivan chairman of the springfield event said saturday i was 
hoping for rain but we didnt get it we feel we can outdo those 
numbers and that will be our aim next year 
we are not giving up he said we can do those numbers even 
if pancakes are more difficult than pouring milk 
during the breakfast battles the rules have changed it started 
out as a challenge to put out the longest table but the guinness 
book of world records said a city in spain once sat 6400 people at 
a table 7908 feet long just shy of a mile and a half 
that was more than battle creek or springfield officials could 
stomach so they changed the name of their contest from the 
worlds longest breakfast table to the worlds largest 
breakfast event

the 250pound pig part of a load of hogs being taken to granite 
city livestock sales jumped off the back of its owners truck at a 
busy street corner and trotted off to a residential area 
he must have climbed on the backs of the other pigs in the 
truck then he leaped out said dan herrmann a witness who helped 
capture the animal after its thursday morning getaway 
its remarkable for a pig to walk away from a jump like that 
without broken legs he must have jumped about four feet herrmann 
said 
the pig ended up in the back yard of herb proell 
he came down the alley and then wandered up to my fence the 
cop was right behind him said proell who was watering his lawn 
i figured i could guide him with a broom and keep him against 
the fence proell said i was talking to him trying to keep him 
in this corner 
after police officers failed to grab the hog herrmann managed to 
lasso it and put it in his truck he took it to the livestock market 
and returned it to owner robert steffenhagen of foley who had 
driven off unaware of his hogs exit 
the athletic animal was sold at auction

attorney general edwin meese iii withdrew himself 
from the wedtech investigation only after a prosecutor refused to 
share evidence in the case with the justice department unless meese 
disqualified himself a newspaper reported sunday 
the new york daily news quoted highlevel sources as saying us 
attorney rudolph giuliani wanted written proof that meese would not 
be supervising the case involving the new york defense contractor 
the nowdefunct company is at the center of an influencepeddling 
scandal regarding its efforts to obtain government contracts 
giulianis refusal in march 1987 to forward evidence to the 
justice department prompted top justice officials to warn meese in 
early april 1987 of evidence linking him to the case the newspaper 
said 
the justice officials warned meese to publicly distance 
himself from the wedtech case and stay away from his close 
friend e robert wallach then a key suspect in the case the 
newspaper said quoting officials who spoke on condition they not be 
identified 
wallach and meeses financial adviser franklyn chinn were 
indicted in december on charges they accepted bribes in exchange for 
using their influence with meese 
federal investigators were looking into meeses links to wedtech 
in october 1986 but five months later meese still had not 
formally withdrawn from supervision of the investigation 
one highlevel justice department section told the news it was 
clearly improper if not illegal conduct by meese for failing to 
quickly disqualify himself from the wedtech investigation 
meese signed a recusal statement on april 8 1987 
however the news said meese told his aides that he might have a 
problem keeping his distance from wallach he had just offered 
wallach a 77500ayear job as counselor to the attorney general 
meeses lawyers said meeses consideration of wallach for the post 
was dropped as soon as he became aware of wallachs status in the 
wedtech case 
sources told the news that meeses actions in the case put 
justice department officials in a delicate position and created an 
appearance that the probe was subject to irregular pressures and 
interference from the top 
department regulations forbid justice officials to have any 
involvement in criminal investigations ion which they or their 
associates have a personal or political interest 
a justice department spokesman patrick korten denied meese 
disqualified himself only after giuliani refused to hand over 
evidence 
mr meese recused himself the moment he was aware that mr 
wallach was a subject of mr giulianis investigation korten said 
sunday 
giuliani who is prosecuting the wedtech trial of rep mario 
biaggi dny declined to comment on the matter 
a meese lawyer jim rocap said meese was not aware of 
conversations giuliani had with justice officials

the leader of panamas roman catholic 
church on sunday criticized political restrictions and us economic 
sanctions saying the crisis weighs heavily on the smallest 
people 
speaking at the traditional corpus christi mass held this year in 
an open field and attended by nearly 40000 people archbishop 
marcos gregorio mcgrath urged panamanian political leaders to 
resolve the dispute he said their actions will determine the 
future of this country for generations to come 
the reagan administration imposed economic sanctions against 
panama after gen manuel antonio noriega commander of the defense 
forces was indicted in february by federal grand juries in florifa 
that accused him of drug trafficking 
noriega who controls the civilian government has rejected us 
efforts to make him resign and leave the country panama uses the 
us dollar as its currency and the sanctions have brought economic 
stagnation and increasing unemployment 
people attending the mass stood under a multicolored cover of 
thousands of umbrellas for the service by mcgrath and other members 
of the panamanian conference of bishops 
the archbishop pleaded for an end to what he called political 
restrictions inside and economic restrictions from abroad 
he also said negotiations to solve the crisis must be in panama 
and among panamanians with the respect among the parties that is 
required by any dialogue 
us officials have been in and out of panama meeting with 
noriega and other leaders trying arrange the generals resignation 
mcgrath said it was the responsibility of the panamanian 
governemnt and the opposition to seek a solution 
we beg them before god and their conscience to make all efforts 
to find the road to reconciliation and justice and peace for all 
he said 
in another development us deputy secretary of state morton 
abramowitz met privately with some opposition leaders opposition 
officials have criticized the reagan administration saying it 
bypassed them in its negotiations with noriega 
one of the panamanians at the talks speaking with the condition 
he not be identified called the meeting a a usgesture 
following the breakdown of negotiations between us envoys and 
noriega 
what can the us offer now he asked this is just a 
formality 
washington purportedly has offered to drop the indictments 
against noriega if he would step down as head of the 15000member 
defense forces 
school officials said they did not expect any serious problems 
monday when nearly 700000 elementary and high school students begin 
the new school year that should have started in march but was 
postponed because of the crisis

vice president george bush with his eye on 
californias environmental vote took another step sunday away from 
reagan administration policies by advocating a delay in a 
controversial offshore oil drilling project 
before going forward with new lease sales we must be assured 
that the national treasure of the california coastline will not be 
harmed bush said at a ceremony dedicating the nations first 
methanol pump at a commercial gasoline station 
i have concluded said bush that the government ought to 
defer lease sale 91 off the coast of northern california 
lease sale 91 is bitterly opposed by environmentalists 
the department of the interior has been pushing ahead with plans 
to permit drilling off the california coast and secretary donald p 
hodel planned to issue his report on sale 91 this summer and it 
could go forward by the end of the year 
bush advocated a delay two days before the california primary but 
with more of an eye on the presidential election in november when 
the states 47 electoral votes are considered crucial to both the 
republican vice president and democratic michael dukakis 
bush is a sure bet to sweep californias 175 republican delegates 
in the winnertakeall gop primary on tuesday 
dukakis is heavily favored to take a lions share of the 314 
democratic delegates in his contest with jesse jackson

celebration of its 1000 anniversary sunday with a special liturgy 
and a wreathlaying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier near 
the kremlin 
we are glad that our jubilee coincides with this very 
beneficial period in soviet history said senior church official 
metropolitan filaret 
about 500 religious representatives from more than 100 countries 
including a highranking vatican delegation crowded into the 
large stone patriarchal cathedral of the epiphany to hear the 
liturgy led by moscows patriarch pimen 
the russian orthodox church blesses wholeheartedly the good 
developments in this country and calls on its flock to take an 
active part in the process of restructuring said filaret 
soviet television showed pimen and other orthodox clergymen 
officiating at the ceremony as the strains of a male choir filled 
the opulently furbished church which has five domes and three 
altars and dates from 1731 
several thousand worshipers crowded the cathedral whose ancient 
icons and relics that are associated both with the history of the 
russian church and the creation of the precommunist russian state 
christianity was introduced by prince vladimir in kievan rus 
the ancient name of what is now the northern soviet republic of the 
ukraine with a baptism ceremony on the banks of the dnieper river

in a rare show of cooperation between church and state the state 
ministry of religion participated in organizing events linked to the 
millenium 
cathedrals in the nations oldest monastery in the ukrainian 
capital of kiev will be returned to the russian orthodox church

state officials 
filaret speaking to a news conference saturday noted that the 
state was also this year permitting the church to publish half a 
million copies of the bible in the russian and ukrainian languages 
the millenium celebrations come as the soviet government is 
considering easing its religious restrictions since the repressive 
era of dictator josef stalin in the 1920s soviet worshipers have 
been required to register with the government and their church 
activities have been severely restricted 
pope john paul ii did not attend the ceremonies although he has 
often expressed the desire to visit the soviet union but the 
vatican said earlier that the russian orthodox church did not extend 
an invitation to the pope russian orthodox churchmen have said john 
paul was invited 
the pontiff has said he would go to the soviet union only on 
condition that he be allowed to visit the heavilycatholic soviet 
republics but john paul has said he has been twice denied 
permission to visit lithuania one of the countrys catholic 
heartlands

diesel fuel from a dredge that sank 
in the st marys river channel on the floridageorgia border is 
threatening sensitive marshes and disrupting navy traffic federal 
officials said sunday 
the channel remained closed sunday blocking both commercial 
traffic from the port of fernandina and military traffic from kings 
bay naval submarine base said coast guard cmdr henry rohrs in 
jacksonville 
the dredge which had been working to deepen the channel to 
accommodate the navys mammoth trident nuclear submarines foundered 
and sank in high winds and heavy seas saturday morning 
while most of the leaking diesel oil from the 168footlong crest 
floated into the atlantic ocean some drifted inside the channel 
containment booms were erected to protect upriver creeks 
seven crew members from the crest owned by the great lakes 
dredging and dock co were plucked from the water as it sank in the 
50foot deep channel a barge alongside broke away and drifted 
several miles south along fernandina beach before it was secured 
officials hoped the containment booms would keep the pollution 
from the tidal marshes of cumberland island part of the federal 
park system 
whats made this one more severe is not so much the oil 
but its spilled in a critically sensitive area said rohrs and 
of course youre blocking a channel youve got the navy and 
commercial traffic 
he said no oil had hit the marshes also no commercial traffic 
was scheduled to enter the channel until monday or tuesday a sonar 
survey of the channel has been planned to see if ships can navigate 
around the dredge 
coast guard capt robert opezio onscene coordinator said the 
sunken dredge contained 40000 gallons of diesel fuel he estimated 
that at a rate of 500 gallons an hour the fuel would leak for three 
days 
the wetlands here are sensitive were prepared to physically 
protect those wetlands opezio said saturday 
he added they are not planning to clean up the fuel drifting in 
the atlantic ocean because it has not reached beaches 
the great lakes dredging and dock co will have to pay for 
cleaning up the spill opezio said bill moore the companys 
project superintendent said he did not know what it would cost 
to assist in the clean up the atlantic strike team a federal 
environmental pollution response unit was dispatched to fernandina 
beach saturday a member of the florida department of environmental 
regulations hazardous waste response team also was there to monitor 
the spill 
also alerted was cindy mosling the founder and director of 
beaks bird emergency and kare sanctuary ms mosling said she was 
prepared to help whatever birds may be suffering affects from the 
oil spill 
diesel is very poisonous to birds she said not only does 
it burn their skin but inhaling it burns their lungs

jesse jackson said sunday that he will fight 
at the democratic convention this summer for a party commitment to 
change practices that impede voting rights 
jackson campaigning in advance of tuesdays primary here also 
said he intends to push hard at the convention on a range of issues 
he considers important including shifting defense spending to 
health care and housing changes in party rules on delegate 
selection and campaign finance reform 
although he used the word fight in his speech he modified 
that in talking to reporters later saying his quest for fairness 
must not be seen as a fight 
fights come when you fail to negotiate when people have 
made a decision to go in opposite directions he said 
while putting the party on notice that he will demand a say on 
several issues at the atlanta convention jackson also pledged 
democratic solidarity announcing his rainbow coalition would 
sponsor a massive voter registration drive beginning aug 1 
the drive will focus on women minorities young people and 
laborers he told a church congregation here 
but we will go further than that he said in atlanta the 
democratic party must make a commitment to empowerment in the 
platform in the party on the ticket 
he did not specify whether his reference to the ticket meant he 
should be given a major say in who the democratic vice presidential 
candidate will be 
jacksons comments came as top campaign officials indicated a 
growing sentiment that he should be offered the vice presidential 
nomination if massachusetts gov michael dukakis becomes the 
nominee as expected 
campaign chairman willie brown the california assembly speaker 
and state cochairwoman assemblywoman maxine waters both voiced 
that opinion on sunday going beyond jacksons own statements 
jackson has said he has earned consideration as a running mate 
and that he likewise would consider dukakis if he himself should win 
a lot of us around him feel he should be offered the vice 
presidential spot said waters 
of dukakis contention that jackson be weighed as a potential 
running mate but will get no special consideration she said we 
all know games when we see them 
brown interviewed on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
said considering jackson should mean actually offering him the no 2 
spot on the ticket 
i think consideration means literally extending the opportunity 
to go on the ticket and then it will be up to mr jackson to 
determine whether or not he wishes to accept it brown said 
asked about browns comment jackson said thats his point of 
view 
told that waters had said she would stay away from the polls in 
november if jackson is not treated fairly by the party jackson 
said i hope everybody will be at the polls in record numbers 
jackson also said his voter registration plans will go ahead 
regardless of whether he gets his way at the convention 
in a day of appearances around the los angeles area jackson 
repeatedly invoked the memory of the late civil rights leader martin 
luther king jr and former sen robert kennedy assassinated 20 
years ago sunday on the night of his presidential primary victory in 
california 
jackson said party rules must reflect the example of dr king 
the inspiration of robert kennedy 
jackson also said it is shameful 20 years after the death of 
martin luther king and robert kennedy that we continue to deprive 
many citizens of the right to vote 
he said he will fight for party rules changes in current 
practices of dual priamries winnertakeall threshholds unelected 
super delegates and other party impediments to one person one 
vote 
he cited studies that have found registration and voting is 
effectively shut off for people in some parts of the country due to 
short or inconvenient registration hours inconvenient and faraway 
locations of registration offices and registration cutoff deadlines 
a month or more before the election before many people start 
focusing on the campaign 
such practices are controlled at the local and state level 
jackson urged passage of legislation in congress that would allow 
registration on election day

the auxiliary archbishop of san 
salvador called on his followers sunday to pray for president jose 
napoleon duarte but said the presidents absence may help end the 
8yearold civil war 
duarte went last week to washington for treatment of cancer 
the absence of the president permits political antagonists to 
not think so much about demolishing their enemy roman catholic 
monsignor gregorio rosa chavez told reporters after mass at the 
metropolitan cathedral 
the political debate will have less passion and that is 
favorable he said 
duarte 62 has been in the walter reed army medical center since 
tuesday night he has cancer of the stomach and liver 
it is widely presumed in el salvador that duarte who is in the 
final year of a 5year term will not be able to resume the 
presidency vicepresident rodolfo castillo claramount is the acting 
chief executive 
before discovering his illness duarte began talks with the two 
parties beside his centrist christian democrats that are represented 
in the legislature 
castillo said last week he planned to continue and broaden that 
initiative with the rightwing nationalist republican alliance and 
the conservative national conciliation party in an effort to draft a 
consensus to be presented to leftist rebels 
in three fruitless rounds of talks since 1984 the rebels have 
demanded a role in a broadly based transition government duarte has 
rejected the demand insisting that the rebels must lay down their 
weapons and compete in elections 
in his homily rosa chavez referred to an allnight prayer vigil 
on behalf of duarte at the cathedral the facade of the building was 
draped with banners reading duarte lives today and forever and 
duarte god and the people are with you 
but only about 150 people were taking part in the visil as of 
midnight

months by the justice departments organized crime task force the

determine if he and his associates have been coercing production 
companies into hiring them to guarantee labor peace the newspaper 
said 
bacow said the allegations are groundless and that his success at 
ending costly labor problems is a natural talent he also said he 
has never been paid for his help except for serving as a paid 
consultant on the film rhinestone 
if people come to me and they believe me and they trust me 
is there something wrong with that bacow said if they want to 
convict me for my godgiven talents they better bring god into 
court 
strike force attorney richard stavin who is reportedly directing 
the inquiry refused to discuss the case or confirm that bacow is 
being investigated

productions including such tv shows as miami vice and magnum 
pi and on the films rhinestone and foul play the times

foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said sunday 
that talks with iran this week on compensation for damage to 
diplomatic property are not designed to help win the release of 
british hostages in lebanon 
but his deputy david mellor said the talks could warm up 
relations between iran and britain which worsened after expulsions 
last year left only one iranian diplomat in london and one british 
diplomat in tehran 
the foreign office said on saturday that a fourman iranian 
delegation will arrive on tuesday for talks with britih officials on 
damage to the iranian embassy in london and damage to the british 
embassy building and other british diplomatic property in iran 
if an agreement is reached under the british proposal the 
foreign office said britain will pay iran 324 million for damage 
to its embassy in london and give londons westminster council 
360000 to maintain the building iran would pay britain 16 
million for damage to british buildings in iran 
there are 18 foreign hostages held by moslem extremists in 
lebanon including nine americans and three britons the longest 
held is terry a anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
it is believed the hostages are held by members of the 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god organization 
david young a lawmaker from the opposition labor party and 
vicechairman of the britishlebanese parliamentary group said on 
sunday a compensation deal could mean that britain was moving toward 
paying for the release of the british hostages 
it now seems that the government is following the route of the 
americans and the french in buying out their hostages he said 
but mellor in an interview on british broadcasting corp radio 
dismissed youngs contention as absolute rubbish irresponsible 
rubbish 
in an interview on tvam howe insisted the talks with the 
iranians had nothing to do with the british hostages who include 
terry waite the archbishop of canterburys special envoy who 
disappeared in beirut on jan 20 1987 
there is an argument about the damage done to the iranian 
embassy premises here and the damage done to our embassy premises 
there howe said he added that is what it is about there is 
nothing of wider significance our policy on hostages is absolutely 
clear no deals 
mellor said britain had always been prepared to hold talks with 
iran and to warm up relations 
if we can sort out these questions of damage to diplomatic 
properties in both of our countries well from an acorn grows an 
oak he said 
from time to time britain has raised the question of iran 
assisting in the release of the hostages on a purely humanitarian 
basis not as a bargaining chip in some rather squalid deal 
mellor said 
such a deal would almost certainly make it more likely that other 
hostages would be taken and drag the name of britain through the 
mud he added 
the foreign office said the compensation talks will focus on 
damage to the iranian embassy building at londons princes gate 
which caught fire when british commandos stormed it in 1980 to end a 
hostage siege and on damage to british diplomatic buildings and the 
british embassy in iran the british properties were damaged by mobs 
in 1978 1979 and 1980 
we want compensation for the damage to our property in iran and 
we want to ensure that the necessary repairs are done to the princes 
gate property which is a health hazard and an eyesore said a 
foreign office spokesman saturday 
following the release last month of the last three french 
hostages in lebanon families of the missing britons have been 
pressing the government to help secure their release 
waite disasppeared while on a mission to try to win the release 
of some of the hostages the other british captives are john 
mccarthy a journalist kidnapped april 17 1986 and brian keenan 
an english teacher at the american university in beirut seized april 
11 1986 keenan is from northern ireland but holds an irish 
passport

a panel of former judges on a commission of inquiry 
arranged by two television companies said sunday there was 
insufficient evidence to determine if kurt waldheim committed war 
crimes as a german army officer 
the panel issued its decision on the austrian president and 
former un generalsecretary after hearing nine days of testimony 
in london in april 
witnesses included officers who served with waldheim in the 
german army in world war ii and survivors of concentration camps and 
civilian massacres 
the inquiry was paid for by americas home box office and 
britains thames television both of which screened a 3hour 
program program sunday night that included some of the testimony and 
the decision by the jurists 
we conclude unanimously that the evidence which has been put 
before us is not enough to make it probable that lt waldheim 
committed any of the war crimes alleged against him in this 
inquiry the panel said 
the five judges also found lapses and aberrations of memory 
such as dr waldheim seems to have had about his services in greece 
and the balkans are not in themselves evidence of guilt but the 
commission said waldheim must have known about german plans to 
shoot captured italian officers 
the former judges who participated in the inquiry came from the 
united states britain canada west germany and sweden 
waldheim has been shunned by many countries including the united 
states which has barred him from entering the country because of 
allegations about his actions as an army lieutenant in the balkans 
from 1942 to 1945 
a historians commission appointed by the austrian government 
that investigated the allegations said in february that waldheim was 
in close proximity to some nazi atrocities in the balkans knew 
they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them 
but it did not support allegations that waldheim was involved in 
committing atrocities waldheim has denied any wrongdoing 
the panel that participated in the television inquiry was headed 
by a retired british appeal court judge sir frederick lawton other 
members were shirley hufstedler a former circuit judge for the us 
court of appeals and west german walter hubner swede gustav petren 
and canadian gordon cooper all retired appeals court judges

soviet union to win the largest global card game ever played the 
world bridge federation announced sunday 
it said jan horwitz and barbara norante of butler pa won the 
bridge contest beating 84356 rivals who played simultaneously in 94 
countries beginning at 8 pm friday and ending saturday morning 
results tabulated saturday were released sunday by the 
federation which organized the event 
their winning score on 24 bridge hands was 7633 percent the 
same hands which took an average of 35 hours to complete were 
played at each location in 2500 cities 
the soviet union competing for the first time held a 
comfortable lead until north america the last to join the 
elaborately timed schedule turned in its results 
names of the soviet players who scored 7592 percent were not 
given 
we got a call with the results from the official bridge league 
in moscow but the line was bad and we were cut off before we got 
the names or where they had played said albert dormer spokesman 
for the bridge federation 
he said the epson worldwide bridge contest will take a place in 
the guinness book of world records as the biggest bridge contest 
ever played beating out a record set last year by the same contest 
in which 73256 people participated 
dormer said the contest also holds the record for the largest 
number of people competing simultaneously in any sport 
by coming in second worldwide the soviet pair will be recognized 
as the european champions 
dormer said that although 50 million people worldwide play 
bridge it had been frowned on in the soviet union as a frivolous 
capitalist game however he said it has gained greater acceptance 
since soviet world chess masters anatoly karpov and garry kasparov 
have been seen playing it between chess rounds 
third place winners were from peru and were identified only as 
garcia and rane they scored 75 percent

several navy rescue swimming instructors 
forced a recruit into a swimming pool shortly before he collapsed 
and died despite his protests that he wanted to quit two 
instructors testified sunday 
petty officer 1st class raymond w jablonowski a safety observer 
at the time of the march 2 death said the instructors more or 
less tossed airman recruit lee mirecki into the pool at pensacola 
naval air station 
they put him back in the water said petty officer 2nd class 
bennie t giles an instructor he wasnt thrown into the water 
he was more or less slid into the water 
the two men testified during a navy investigative hearing here on 
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery charges 
against five instructors and a dereliction of duty count against the 
schools commanding officer lt thomas a torchia 
the hearing scheduled to continue monday is to determine 
whether the six should be courtmartialed 
a doctor testified saturday that mirecki 19 of appleton wis 
died of apparent heart failure most likely induced by fear 
i remember him saying i cant do it i cant do it giles 
said i remember him saying he didnt want to go back in the 
pool 
giles said he could identify only one of the defendants petty 
officer 1st class david j smith as being among a group of 
instructors who forced mirecki back into the pool 
jablonowski said he could remember another defendant in the 
group petty officer 2nd class frankie d deaton 
giles said petty officer 1st class richard e blevins another of 
the defendants took charge of the instruction session when mirecki 
first left the pool jablonowski said blevins was known around the 
school as the antichrist 
neither giles nor jablonowski were charged 
after mirecki was back in the water giles said he talked to him 
and the recruit calmed down but he said that within minutes petty 
officer 2nd class michael combe dived in and put mirecki into a head 
hold the exercise called for recruits to extricate themselves from 
such holds 
earlier testimony indicated that after he was forced back in the 
water mirecki grabbed on to a rope dividing the shallow and deep 
ends of the pool but combe and petty officer 2nd class john zelenock 
pulled him loose combe and zelenock were the other instructors 
charged 
giles and jablonowski both said mirecki apparently escaped from 
the hold by combe just before collapsing 
jablonowski said he signaled to end the exercise when he noticed 
mirecki getting weaker 
combe then brought mirecki to the side of the pool where 
instructors and corpsmen tried to revive him giles said 
giles said there was no formal policy requiring one or more 
instructors to remain out of the water as safety observers but that 
they took turns observing during the drill he said 
under questioning by cmdr daniel j dalesio the investigating 
officer giles said there was no release signal for students to give 
if they were in trouble while in an instructors grasp and that 
there was no formal safety indoctrination as part of the course 
taken to become an instructor 
under questioning by lawyers for the defendants and government 
giles denied that zelenock punched mirecki and said he was unable to 
recall when during the series of events students were told to turn 
away and sing the national anthem 
students had testified they were told to sing when mirecki 
allegedly was being forced screaming back into the pool

foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe gave cautious 
backing sunday to vice president george bushs campaign for the 
presidency 
interviewer david frost asked howe on tvam if britain would 
prefer republican bush to his probable democratic opponent 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
one has to be very cautious about expressing opinions on 
elections in other countries because it is part of the democratic 
process one works with the leader who emerges at the end of the 
day the foreign secretary replied 
but at this stage it would be less than human if we did not 
recognize the value of working with george bush with whom we have 
worked for a long time howe said 
if there is anything in the oversimplified leftright divide 
in politics he is on the right in politics and so are we in this 
country 
the relationship between the united states and britain has 
flourished during the 1980s under their two conservative leaders 
president reagan and prime minister margaret thatcher

secretary of state george p shultz failed on 
sunday to persuade israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir to accept 
terms set by king hussein of jordan for holding mideast peace talks 
i think on the whole we had a good discussion about this 
shultz said before flying back to egypt from israel as far as any 
major shift in anybodys position i cannot report that 
shultz said at israels ben gurion airport we are going to 
stay engaged and do everything we can for the balance of this 
reagan administration to accomplish as much as we can and leave 
for our successors as constructive and positive situation as we 
possibly can 
shultz had two meetings with shamir in jerusalem in an effort to 
persuade him to agree to negotiate with jordan with a commitment for 
israel to exchange land in the occupied territories for arab 
recognition shultz also met in israel with foreign minister shimon 
peres defense minister yitzhak rabin and members of the 
parliaments foreign affairs and defense committees 
he told israel in a public statement that the continued 
occupation of the west bank and gaza and the frustation of 
palestinian rights is a deadend street he added the belief 
that this can continue is an illusion 
he also spoke of the prospect of another war in a region where 
longrange missiles and chemical weapons have proliferated 
the next war shultz said will be unlike any conflict we have 
seen before involving more casualties and proving harder to 
contain 
king hussein in talks saturday with shultz in amman insisted on 
an israeli commitment to withdraw as a precondition for accepting 
the us proposal for peace talks shultz said he had emphasized to 
shamir the need for king husseins side to feel there is something 
to negotiate about 
jordan lost the west bank which it controlled from 1948 until 
1967 in the sixday war with israel 
shultz said despite his failure to persuade shamir i can 
report what seems to me a very genuine desire to be engaged and to 
be involved not just for the sake of being able to say that in a 
genuine search for peace 
shultz who is based in egypt during his middle east shuttle 
effort will go to syria monday for talks with president hafez assad 
about the faltering us peace plan and the arab summit meeting that 
opens tuesday in algeria shultz hopes to persuade the syrian leader 
to take a moderate position the secretary of state will then go to 
luxor to visit ancient egyptian sites 
a shamir adviser said the prime minister and shultz discussed 
peace options but he did not elaborate he said shultz ensured 
shamir that the relations between israel and the united states will 
be strengthened in the future 
the adviser yossi ben aharon accused king hussein of attempting 
to negotiate the disposition of the west bank through the united 
states we prefer him to say this to us directly the israeli 
official said 
the occupied lands were virtually shut down sunday for the third 
day of a strike called by leaders of the arab uprising to protest 
shultzs visit it was shultzs fourth trip to the region this year 
to promote the peace plan 
two israelis and more than 200 palestinians have died since 
december as a result of violence in the west bank and in the gaza 
strip which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
shultz also called on arabs to accept israels existence the 
belief that this can be avoided or that violence can end israeli 
occupation is an illusion shultz said 
peres who backs the us plan said shultzs mission sends a 
loud and clear message to all listeners a message of a hope and 
choice 
the plan calls for an international peace conference in which the 
united states the soviet union china britain and france as the 
five permanent members of the un security council would serve as 
hosts the negotiations would be aimed at selfrule for 15 million 
palestinian arabs in the west bank and gaza but not a separate 
state 
in a second stage israel and the arabs would try to find an 
overall settlement to their conflict

the socialists and conservatives virtually split the 
popular vote in sundays first round of elections for the national 
assembly french television projected president francois 
mitterrands socialists will win the most seats 
based on 97 percent of the ballots counted the socialists had 
374 percent of the vote when the counting was stopped late sunday 
the conservative rally for the republic and centerright union for 
french democracy which backed the same candidates garnered 377 
percent 
the communists took 112 percent and the rightist national front 
97 percent with the rest going to minor parties 
counting was to resume monday 
staterun antenne 2 networks projections gave the socialists 
between 310 and 330 seats in the 577seat assembly it said the 
rally for the republic and union for french democracy would win 
230250 seats and the communists 1020 with the national front shut 
out 
in predicting the makeup of the new assembly the lower and more 
powerful house of parliament the television network projected the 
final outcome for all districts including areas that will have 
runoff elections next sunday 
candidates needed at least 50 percent of the vote in the first 
round to win a seat in the legislature in districts where there was 
no winner in the first round candidates had to receive at least 
125 percent of the firstround votes to be eligible for the june 12 
runoff 
there is inevitable pressure on those coming in lower than second 
to drop out and support one of the two frontrunners in the runoff 
this system was expected to hurt the smaller parties but help the 
socialists in 1986 before the new system was adopted seats were 
assigned on the basis of the percentage of votes won by lists of 
candidates 
projections showed 655 percent of the 38 million people eligible 
to vote cast ballots one of the lowest turnouts in recent years 
that compares with 785 percent in the march 1986 legislative 
election and 814 percent in the first round of the presidential 
election april 24 
polls had predicted a wider socialist advantage 
its an encouraging result but we have to consolidate it 
said former conservative finance minister edouard balladur 
victory is possible if we unite we have a week to convince all 
those who do not want to give a majority to the socialist party 
polls also predicted the communist party and the extremeright 
national front which each won 35 seats in the last election 
would fare badly because of the winnertakeall voting system 
reinstituted two years ago 
the election came less than a month after mitterrand defeated 
former premier jacques chirac a conservative with a solid 54 
percent of the vote 
conservatives controlled the national assembly from 1986 until 
mitterrand dissolved it after his reelection 
mitterrand had said during his presidential campaign he wanted to 
work with the existing national assembly and open the cabinet to 
nonsocialists from the political center 
new premier michel rocard formed a government with no notable 
presence from other parties however and mitterrand called the 
election 
the sunday newspaper journal du dimanche noted in a frontpage 
editorial that despite the importance of the election for the 
future the campaign gave rise only to boredom or indifference 
few issues were debated the socialists declared they were ready 
to institute a guaranteed minimum wage to be paid for in part with 
a special tax on large fortunes such a tax was abolished by the 
right in 1986 
socialists continued with mittterrands opening theme through 
the campaign but most politicians of the right and centerright 
viewed the idea as little more than an invitation for them to become 
socialist

a panel of former judges on a commission of inquiry 
arranged by two television companies said sunday there was 
insufficient evidence to determine if kurt waldheim committed war 
crimes as a german army officer 
the panel issued its decision on the austrian president and 
former un generalsecretary after hearing nine days of testimony 
in london in april 
witnesses included officers who served with waldheim in the 
german army in world war ii and survivors of concentration camps and 
civilian massacres 
the inquiry was paid for by americas home box office and 
britains thames television both of which screened a 3hour 
program program sunday night that included some of the testimony and 
the decision by the jurists 
we conclude unanimously that the evidence which has been put 
before us is not enough to make it probable that lt waldheim 
committed any of the war crimes alleged against him in this 
inquiry the panel said 
the five judges also found lapses and aberrations of memory 
such as dr waldheim seems to have had about his services in greece 
and the balkans are not in themselves evidence of guilt but the 
commission said waldheim must have known about german plans to 
shoot captured italian officers 
the former judges who participated in the inquiry came from the 
united states britain canada west germany and sweden 
waldheim has been shunned by many countries including the united 
states which has barred him from entering the country because of 
allegations about his actions as an army lieutenant in the balkans 
from 1942 to 1945 
a historians commission appointed by the austrian government 
that investigated the allegations said in february that waldheim was 
in close proximity to some nazi atrocities in the balkans knew 
they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them 
but it did not support allegations that waldheim was involved in 
committing atrocities waldheim has denied any wrongdoing 
the panel that participated in the television inquiry was headed 
by a retired british appeal court judge sir frederick lawton other 
members were shirley hufstedler a former circuit judge for the us 
court of appeals and west german walter hubner swede gustav petren 
and canadian gordon cooper all retired appeals court judges

the public increasingly pays for services that once were free

the name masks the purpose american engineering 
co is in the business of death 
lethal injection machines electric chairs gallows and gas 
chambers form the catalog of equipment designed and built by 
american engineering believed to be the only company in the united 
states that exclusively makes execution equipment 
four years ago it created the first computercontrolled machine 
to regulate the flow of drugs in a lethal injection five states 
have bought the 30000 device company president norbert c lynch 
said from new jersey in 1984 to delaware earlier this year 
in 1983 an engineer friend of lynchs heard a disc jockey 
mocking new jersey because it advertised for executioners the idea 
was planted how to automate lethal injection 
the methodology thats used in the lethal injection on a manual 
system is barbaric lynch said who runs the company and a 
financial consulting firm from a storefront here 
the basic complications in lethal injection both lynch and death 
penalty opponents agree are ruptured veins inaccurate dosages and 
failure to immediately induce unconsciousness 
of the 37 states where capital punishment is legal 16 prescribe 
death by lethal injection some like delaware havent executed 
anyone in decades and have electric chairs and gas chambers that 
might not work if needed 
according to the american civil liberties union 98 people have 
been executed in the united states since the supreme court upheld 
the death penalty in 1976 including five this year and 25 in 1987 
more than 2020 inmates populate death row aclu figures show 
delaware contracted for one of the machines last year after the 
state changed its capital punishment law to lethal injection from 
hanging said h brooke laggner chief of administration and 
operational support for the state department of correction 
it takes away the element that you dont have any hippocratic 
oath problems because all you need is someone to set up an iv 
laggner said of the machine which delaware bought along with a 
60000 execution trailer designed by american engineering 
civil libertarians rail at that sort of thinking saying there is 
no ethical justification in making executions easier or more 
efficient 
the worst sin of all is to do that well which shouldnt be done 
at all said henry schwarzschild director of the aclus capital 
punishment project 
the notion that a homicide becomes nicer if you do it nicely is 
morally outrageous he said 
a 3by4foot gray box with a row of switches and red lights 
lynchs machine is mounted to the wall above the inmates gurney 
intravenous tubing inserted by a medical technician into the 
inmates arm runs through the wall to a computerized control module 
two executioners push one button each to start the machine so 
neither knows who actually activates the pistons that send the three 
deadly drugs through syringes and into the inmate 
a dosage of sodium pentathol renders the inmate unconscious the 
second drug is pancuronium bromide or pavulon which in large doses 
paralyzes body functions the third potassium chloride ensures 
heart arrest 
the execution should take four to six minutes lynch said the 
prisoner wont feel anything hes going to go out and thats the 
end of it over and out 
american engineering with assets of about 100000 has a 
limited market for its wares but lynch feels the condition of the 
nations execution devices and the lack of competition could mean 
more contracts 
for states that dont use lethal injection american engineering 
also designs electric chairs gas chambers and gallows 
lynch said he has sold three electric helmets at 5000 apiece 
and three sets of leg stocks at 2000 each and redesigned one 
gallows for 15000 citing confidentiality lynch refused to 
identify the states involved 
lynch said he opposes capital punishment but noted that if its 
going to be done it should be done right if were going to hang 
this person then we should be using the proper rope and you cant 
blame the ropemaker for the hanging

the first instinct of thousands of investors 
shocked by the almost instant evaporation of their money in the 
october stock market crash was to sue their brokers 
it was then that many got a second shock they discovered they 
had signed away their right to go to court 
fine print buried in most brokerage firms paperwork requires 
customers to settle disputes through an arbitration hearing 
sponsored by the new york stock exchange the national association 
of securities dealers or other market organization 
arbitration because it is cheaper and faster than suing is a 
good deal for many customers particularly those who claim damages 
of 50000 or less 
but there is only a limited right to appeal and some investors 
big losers and those whose brokers actions were especially 
egregious may be better off in court 
and even investors likely to recover all or part of their losses 
in arbitration may not want to give up the option to sue before they 
know the nature of the dispute 
big institutional investors have always had the clout to 
negotiate contracts with securities firms but a survey earlier this 
year by the staff of the securities and exchange commission found 
that individual investors have little choice 
of 65 firms handling 90 percent of all customer accounts 
virtually all require arbitration particularly for customers who 
borrow money from the firm through margin accounts or trade in risky 
stock options 
members of congress and the sec concerned that mandatory 
arbitration adds to the popular perception that the markets are 
stacked against the individual are hoping to restore customers 
right to choose 
three states california massachusetts and new mexico are 
also considering proposals to restrict arbitration clauses 
according to the north american securities administrators 
association an organization of state regulators 
the issue is becoming more acute as the number of arbitration 
cases soars because of the crash and because the supreme court last 
june upheld the legality of mandatory arbitration clauses the 
association said that the number of cases quintupled from 800 in 
1980 to 4100 last year and could climb above 6000 this year 
at a recent sec hearing chairman david s ruder said that he 
believes arbitration offers a fine opportunity for cost saving 
but as a matter of fairness firms ought to be barred from denying 
service to a customer who doesnt want to sign an arbitration clause 
i fail to see why we should deny access to the securities 
markets to one who is unwilling to waive their dispute into 
arbitration in advance he said 
commodity brokers are already forbidden to force customers to 
arbitrate 
the commission for two hours last wednesday debated whether to 
ask congress to extend the ban to securities brokers but after 
lastminute lobbying by the securities industry it postponed the 
decision for a month to give firms a chance to press their 
opposition 
william j fitzpatrick general counsel of the securities 
industry association said that congress and the sec are trying to 
craft a solution to a problem that does not exist 
the system is fair only a very small percentage of complaints to 
the sec are about arbitration he said 
and he said the market organizations are moving to put in place 
a number of changes recommended by the sec last september they 
include education for arbitrators and guidelines designed to keep 
people with industry ties from serving in the public slots on 
arbitration panels 
moreover firms are not denying customers access to the market 
fitzpatrick said most dont require customers with cash accounts to 
sign arbitration clauses he said and customers who want to borrow 
money on margin can go to banks or elsewhere 
the proposal before government officials essentially says to a 
brokerdealer you no longer have a right as a businessman to make a 
judgment to control your legal expenses through the use of 
arbitration he said 
it makes no sense to force disputes into a court system 
where it takes five to seven years to get a case out and nobody wins 
except the trial attorneys he said 
nevertheless ruder appears to have the backing of a majority of 
his fivemember commission aulana peters is firmly in his corner 
and charles cox said he would have to be persuaded to vote against 
the proposal 
in the meantime congress is proceeding on its own the house 
energy and commerce subcommittee on finance scheduled a hearing on 
the issue for thursday 
rep rick boucher dva is preparing legislation that would 
require firms to present arbitration clauses under a heading with 
large type and on a separate sheet of paper firms would be 
forbidden to reject customers who decline to sign the clause or 
charge them an added fee for refusing 
boucher said he reviewed one form used by several firms and found 
the arbitration clause in small print in a section with an unrelated 
headline 
even a very careful reading of the form might not reveal the 
binding arbitration language i was looking for it and it took me 
quite a while he said 
that to me is improper if a person is going to surrender his 
right to a trial in court the person should do so with full 
knowledge and secondly it should be a purely voluntary decision 
he said

the health of the economy is at risk the 
federal debt is swelling and the politicians are gridlocked 
whats a nation to do 
call in the bureaucrat 
that may sound a little odd but a consummate washington insider 
was required to direct the new bipartisan national economic 
commission in its mission to cut the deficit 
the commission director not only needed a thorough knowledge of 
the budget but had to be trusted by both sides of the political 
spectrum and perhaps most important someone was needed with skill 
in handling giant egos 
enter dave mathiasen of the presidents office of management and 
budget 
described by a colleague as the quintessential staff person 
mathiasen first worked at omb in 1961 before it was omb when it 
was just the bureau of the budget 
hes made a career of public service mostly at omb but also 
overseas as an economist for the agency for international 
development at omb he has worked for democrats and republicans 
bert lance and david stockman 
now mathiasen has to use that experience to stay in the 
background but still guide the commission members to a conclusion on 
the deficit by their selfimposed deadline of december 21st 
the common wisdom in washington is that the commission would 
provide political cover for a tax increase and some spending 
cuts leading george bush already to preemptively say he wont 
support it 
but mathiasen says predicting the commissions actions would be a 
mistake and he wont try to read the minds of members who include 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca and former secretary of defense caspar 
weinberger 
if you havent decided what time youre going home tonight i 
cant forecast it and if i do im a fool he said in an 
interview last week 
with the commission just starting up mathiasens major effort is 
to educate the members most of whom have little exposure to the 
federal budget his staff is creating a computer game where members 
can try out different policies and instantly receive a computation 
of their effect on the deficit 
the cochairmen of the commission are robert strauss a 
washington lawyer and democratic party power broker and drew lewis 
president reagans former secretary of transportation who now heads 
the union pacific railroad it will be their job to plead and cajole 
the panel toward a consensus with mathiasen smoothing whatever path 
they choose 
the deficit commission is frequently compared in washington to 
the socalled greenspan commission led by nowfederal reserve board 
chairman alan greenspan whose recommendations led to the 1983 
financial revamping of the social security program 
the national economic commission has even moved into the 
townhouse across from the white house where the greenspan group was 
based 
however mathiasen says this mission is different 
social security was facing a crisis and there was the threat 
that the checks would not go out unless action was taken while most 
economists agree that the federal deficit 150 billion last year 
is bad for the economy its effects are more difficult to single out 
if we were able to say that on the 13th of march 1989 the 
stock market will drop unless action is taken then weve got a 
deal mathiasen said 
mathiasen agrees that perhaps the most important factor in 
whether the commission succeeds will be the attitude of the next 
presidentelect before taking office the next president can 
appoint two more commission members 
the hope of the panel is to prevent its work from getting snarled 
in presidential politics but then quickly make its recommendations 
to help build a consensus on how to reduce the deficit for the next 
president and next congress to enact

california voters who sparked a 
nationwide taxpayer revolt with proposition 13 a decade ago are 
being asked in a series of ballot measures whether they are having 
some second thoughts 
although gloomy predictions of fiscal disaster remain largely 
unrealized since the measure cut property taxes by 7 billion or an 
average of 57 percent proposition 13 has had its visible effects 
the public increasingly pays for services that once were free 
including parks and recreation programs public grounds look 
scruffier than they did 10 years ago as officials have cut back on 
maintenance 
state bailouts and creative funding schemes are credited with 
keeping most local governments afloat since the measure was approved 
june 6 1978 but many agree that schools and rural counties have 
suffered under the cuts 
so on tuesday voters in 26 of the states 57 counties will 
decide whether to raise sales and other taxes in their areas to pay 
for highways schools libraries jails and other services that were 
threatened or eliminated by proposition 13 
at the same time two rival statewide measures proposition 71 
and proposition 72 will ask voters whether to ease a 
constitutional spending limit and provide more money for schools or 
highways 
the spending limit in the form of an initiative written by 
taxcut pioneer paul gann was approved in a special election nine 
months after proposition 13 it requires that spending be strictly 
tied to increases in population and the nationwide cost of living 
the two new measures would alter that limit proposition 71 
whose main supporter is state schools superintendent bill honig 
would permit additional funding for schools proposition 72 written 
by gann himself would allow new money for highway construction 
republican gov george deukmejian grappling with a 11 billion 
budget deficit opposes both measures 
other issues on tuesdays ballot include a proposal to empower 
the state to quarantine aids victims and local measures that could 
close the rancho seco nuclear power plant and divide san bernardino 
county into two 
california also is holding a us senate primary along with new 
mexico montana and new jersey montana in addition is having 
primaries in both parties for governor 
proposition 13 whose war cry was quickly picked up by voters in 
massachusetts and other states decreed that property tax 
assessments be rolled back immediately to 197576 levels it limited 
annual property taxes to 1 percent of the market value and 
stipulated that assessed values and thus taxes could be increased 
by only 2 percent annually until a property is sold then the new 
owners property tax bill starts at 1 percent of the purchase price 
the measure also made it extremely difficult for local school 
districts to raise property taxes requiring that voters approve any 
new taxes by a twothirds margin 
the year before proposition 13 was approved local governments 
received 103 billion in property taxes according to the state 
board of equalization in 197879 the first year after proposition 
13 that figure plunged to 49 billion 
the immediate crunch was eased by the state which contributed 
44 billion in 197879 but over the years that state support has 
worn thin 
mary anne houx president of the california school boards 
association said there is little money for vocational education 
afterschool sports and fine arts programs for the states 45 
million students 
its not like it was before when the board of education could 
raise money locally and for the big bucks we could go to the voters 
and ask for approval with a simple majority said houx 
many school libraries have been closed or forced to curtail their 
hours more than 11 billion is needed for new school construction 
throughout the state and deferred maintenance costs are approaching 
150 million houx said 
the city of oaklands street repair unit faces 60 million in 
deferred maintenance costs that built up in the eight years after 
proposition 13 passed in 1986 residents approved a 15year sales 
tax increase to pay for street maintenance and repair 
an increasing number of residents of humboldt county in the 
northwestern section of the state are driving on gravel as 
officials give up on maintaining many deteriorating roads 
shasta county with 125000 residents replaced a 73bed public 
hospital that also served several neighboring counties with a clinic

the harvard business school is making it clear that 
it wants a smaller proportion of its graduates to head for wall 
street investment banking 
the business school reported last week that 15 percent of its 
current crop of graduates had been hired by major securities firms 
compared to about 30 percent in 1987 
we dont want investment banking to be the beall and endall 
of a harvard mba said margaret lang the business schools 
director of placement 
school officials said they began shifting the emphasis away from 
investment banking even before last octobers stock market crash 
there was a real concern that we were being typecast as a 
school for investment bankers and consultants said professor 
robert hayes a technology management expert our mission is to 
train general managers we were afraid of losing our heritage 
the changes at harvard included improving its manufacturing 
faculty changing its admissions policies to deemphasize financial 
skills and choosing fewer people from wall street apprenticeship 
programs 
a decade ago just 8 percent of harvard business school graduates 
went into investment banking while consulting was the job of choice 
attracting 22 percent 
but the bull market that began in 1982 and the 
mergerandacquisition binge that started soon afterward shifted the 
balance 
in 1978 harvard students could expect to earn roughly the same 
starting salary on wall street as in manufacturing by 1987 wall 
street salaries were about 10 percent higher than those in 
manufacturing but with bonuses figured in the gap was closer to 50 
percent 
there were complaints that american manufacturing was being 
shortchanged 
we now have a group coming out of business schools going to 
wall street and contributing nothing to the efficiency of american 
industry nothing to its productivity retired harvard economist 
john kenneth galbraith said in 1987 
last march harvard hired steven wheelwright a specialist in 
manufacturing from stanford university 
but officials said the changes may still not funnel more bright 
young graduates into the production sector 
we can do all the pushing and cajoling we want said 
harvards robert hayes but if companies do not offer jobs at 
competitive salaries the students will not go that way 
i tell students that tomorrows chief executive officers will 
be the ones who solve our production problems said lester thurow 
dean of the sloan school of management at the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
but thurow said his message is not taking root yet and that the 
business school students still consider manufacturing a secondclass 
profession

rail labor finding itself backed into a 
corner has softened its opposition to proposed random drug 
testing of railroad workers union officials said 
the change comes as the department of transportation prepares to 
hold hearings in chicago atlanta los angeles and washington on its 
proposal to mandate random drug testing for all train personnel 
working with moving trains 
as recently as last wednesday federal railroad administrator 
john riley spoke in an interview of labors uncompromising effort 
to stop testing in any form 
he said some rail labor leaders seemed to care more about 
protecting the employees who use drugs in the workplace than those 
who dont 
but on friday lawrence l mann attorney for the railway labor 
executives association which represents rail unions said there 
has been a reconsideration of labors position 
while the department of transportations random testing plan 
wont be finalized until sometime after the field hearings end mann 
said it may be that labor will be able to embrace it 
still he said he had constitutional questions about the plan in 
part because it seemed to assume that those who are tested are 
guilty 
mann also said the proposed program does not appear to do enough 
to promote rehabilitation there should be a cooperative program 
encouraging people to seek out rehabilitation before a problem 
occurs mann said 
while rlea represents some 20 unions mann said he did not 
necessarily speak for all the members 
charles fountain of the brotherhood of maintenance of way 
employees said the best drug programs resulted not from legislation 
but from agreements between individual railroads and unions 
but he said labor was backed into a corner by the 
inevitability of congressional action on random testing 
lets face it there will some kind of legislation passed one 
way or another fountain said 
the dot hearings which begin in chicago on june 14 and end here 
two weeks later are designed to solicit public opinion and help 
government lawyers shape the program 
transportation officials believe they have authority to implement 
random drug testing even though congress has not passed legislation 
requiring such a program 
still it would be a boost to the departments position if 
congress acted according to riley it would clarify our 
authority he said 
riley said the current rules for testing based on reasonable 
cause are limited because they are tied to a supervisors ability to 
detect symptoms 
that is a severe limitation in the drug area because many of 
the drugs in vogue in the workplace today can impair an engineers 
time or spatial perceptions without giving rise to a symptom that 
would be recognized by even an educated laymen riley said 
even before proposing random drug testing on may 5 attorneys for 
dot were already in court defending mandatory drug testing for train 
crew members involved in major accidents that program has continued 
while the department appeals a federal appeals court ruling on feb 
11 that declared such testing unconstitutional 
the court ruling stemmed from a suit filed by rail labor unions 
a signal that labor has relaxed its opposition to random drug 
testing came in the response by union officials friday to new 
legislation by rep thomas luken dohio 
his bill would give dot 90 days to set up procedures for 
administering random drug tests significantly for labor it 
contains provisions mandating rehabilitation and education and 
protecting workers against inaccurate test results 
we believe the bill is a constructive approach to substabce 
abuse in the workplace if random testing is to become law said 
richard i kilroy chairman of rlea and president of the 
transportation communications union 
however we still have serious constitutional concerns that we 
will not abandon without adequate safeguards he said

saudi arabia posted a 24 billion 
trade surplus last year more than seven times the 1986 surplus the 
finance ministry said in a report sunday 
the 1986 surplus totaled 360000 said excerpts of the report 
that were circulated by the official saudi press agency 
the big increase followed a major effort by the saudis to 
diversify their economy away from dependence on oil revenues they 
have developed agriculture wheat and food products for export as 
well as domestic consumption 
the ministry report said exports totalled 2256 billion last 
year and imports 20 billion 
in 1986 exports totaled 1924 billion with imports pegged at 
1888 billion the report said 
the saudi news agency did not provide any breakdown of export 
figures and gave only a partial list of import statistics 
the finance ministry report showed 812 percent of saudi arabias 
imports last year came from 15 countries headed by japan the 
united states britain west germany and italy 
imports from arab league states last year increased by 86 
percent over the preceding year while imports from nonarab islamic 
states increased by 98 percent 
the oilrich kingdoms major import categories all rose last 
year at least in value the agency report only cited import values 
they were listed as foodstuffs and livestock which increased by 
72 percent in value beverages and tobacco by 12 percent raw 
materials by 216 percent vegetable oils and fats by 104 percent 
machinery and transport equipment by 21 percent furniture 
clothing and shoes by 57 percent 
saudi arabia sits on almost onethird of the worlds proven oil 
reserves but has been hard hit by a weak world oil market since the 
early 1980s 
saudi arabia has a population of around 12 million including an 
estimated 3 million expatriate workers

three years ago larry bell set out to 
grab a share of the retail beer market a very small share 
bell owns one of a growing number of microbrewers small 
companies that make small amounts of beer mostly heavier brews 
sales doubled last year and bell 29 hopes his kalamazoo 
brewery will break even or even turn a profit this year 
he began his business on 39000 borrowed from friends in a 
former plumbing supply store with a 15gallon pot and stove while 
business has picked up a bit everything still is done by hand 
bell once said his brewery was the smallest in the country he 
now produces about 1400 barrels of ale annually which may bring in 
about 250000 in sales this year mushrooming from the 65000 in 
sales last year 
the association of brewers estimates there are 80 microbreweries 
nationwide up from 46 two years ago some speculate that the 
popularity of the breweries increased as people began looking for 
alternatives to light highly carbonated us beers 
despite the growth of these small operations major brewers 
arent foaming about competition last year less than 01 percent 
of the 187 million barrels of beer were consumed in the united 
states came from small brewers 
thats not a number that one takes very seriously said jerry 
steinman publisher of the beer marketers insight newsletter it 
would take tremendous growth before the microbreweries have any 
effect on the industry 
one of the big problems for little breweries is delivery beer 
that isnt pasteurized goes bad without refrigeration a problem 
that drove chelsea brewing co of ann arbor mich out of business 
several years ago 
the failure rate for small breweries is pretty high said jeff 
mendel administrator of the institute for fermentation and brewing 
in boulder colo 
about one brewery in five closes down he said some last 
four or five years and some close in a matter of weeks 
meantime bell keeps pumping out his brew with an eye toward some 
mechanization he bought a bottling machine but it is in need of 
repair he hopes to raise another 100000 for more equipment 
its very difficult to make money when youre washing bottles 
by hand he said were just starting to get to the breakeven 
point but its been a real crap shoot

even party tricks can have scientific 
interest and a towson state college chemistry professor will tell a 
conference this week about the tiny sparks that appear when you bite 
wintergreen candy in the dark 
linda sweeting has been researching the phenomenon technically 
known as triboluminescence for five years crushing candies in her 
laboratory and carefully measuring the dim flashes shell present 
her findings at the third chemical congress of north america in 
toronto 
she admits she also sometimes ducks into closets to crunch the 
candy and watch the bluish sparks of mouth lightning 
substances that flash when theyre rubbed crushed or broken 
include sugar salt quartz and human bones 
triboluminescence a name drawn from the greek word tribein 
meaning to rub was first reported by sir francis bacon in 1605 
ms sweeting 46 took advantage of recent technological advances 
in highly accurate measuring instruments to confirm basic theories 
about triboluminescence developed in the 1930s and to add more 
accurate knowledge about the range of light emitted 
she drew upon wintergreen candy studies conducted in the 1930s by 
princeton university researcher e newton harvey 
she said the tiny sparks are created because when sucrose sugar 
crystals fracture under pressure positive and negative electrical 
charges separate voltage builds up until electrons leap across the 
fracture and the discharge makes nitrogen molecules in the air emit 
a tiny burst of light 
that light comes mainly in the invisible ultraviolet region of 
the spectrum but when wintergreen is added the light becomes 
visible as blue sparks because wintergreen molecules glow when 
excited by the flash of the initial spark a tiny reaction that ends 
in milliseconds 
although he has not seen the results to be presented in toronto 
jeffrey zink a professor of chemistry at the university of 
california at los angeles who furthered the research in the early 
1980s said he didnt find the mechanism to be quite as ms sweeting 
described it he said its behavior could vary from crystal to 
crystal 
ms sweeting said she stands by her research which was very 
carefully done on the same batch of crystals 
i guess most of the scientific community would think this is 
not real important she said but its fundamental knowledge of 
crystals how energy flows in and out of molecules and there are 
going to be practical applications down the road 
as an example she suggested that a triboluminescent film could 
could be used to coat parts of orbiting satellites so that 
earthbased instruments could detect any light emissions produced 
when the materials are put under unexpected stress

the race is on to develop new tools that 
can make the tiny silicon microchips that will run future 
generations of computers 
the prize will be the entire world electronics market of 1996 
and beyond said john d wiley associate dean of the university 
of wisconsins college of engineering in madison 
with west german and japanese electronics firms already jockeying 
for position an electronic storage ring may just be the best tool 
american industry will need to keep pace 
the special device can produce finely etched computer chips the 
guts of the electronics industry but building a new one from 
scratch could cost 15 million to 20 million an hefty investment 
even for a large company 
yet in a cluttered metal building overlooking lake kegonsa the 
university of wisconsin is operating its own ring dubbed aladdin 
and is willing to make the device available for industrial research 
chips now are manufactured by a process known as lithography in 
which the myriad of components on a chip are printed on the wafer 
through the use of lightsensitive films and etching chemicals 
aladdin which is 80feet in diameter and uses as much 
electricity as a small town can apply 800 million volts of spin to 
electrons to produce the soft xrays that will allow even finer 
etching of computer chips than ultraviolet light can accomplish 
the only other storage ring in the country that produces soft 
xrays is at brookhaven national laboratory on long island ny 
and it is booked solid 
last week only 17 of aladdins 36 available beam lines were in 
use and the university hopes industry snatches up some of those 
still available 
university scientists say it is time for aladdin to do industrial 
research as well as academic research in xray lithography 
the japanese have spent an estimated 1 billion to develop the 
technology needed to build the new generation of smaller computer 
chips said university physicist david huber who is in charge of 
aladdin 
in the united states congress appropriated 15 million for such 
research last year and is expected to provide 35 million this year 
huber said 
among private companies in the united states only computer giant 
ibm has invested significantly in the technology and even it 
realizes it cannot carry the research burden alone he said 
there are 15 new rings now under construction in japan there 
is only one being built in this country wiley said he said the 
germans have had a thriving applied research program in xray 
lithography since 1978 
if we dont play a role its unlikely this country is going to 
embrace the technology huber said 
assuming the much earlier and larger japanese and european 
investments do not render our program irrelevant before it gets 
started wiley said the us may actually have a chance to 
regain a competitive position in this technology
