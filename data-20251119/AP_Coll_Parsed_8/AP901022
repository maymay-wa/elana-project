humphrey the wayward whale who captured 
the nations heart while wandering through san francisco bay five 
years ago got stuck on mudflats and then on a submerged rock in 
the bay monday 
worried rescuers tried coax the mammoth mammal off the rock and 
out to sea 
this could be very serious when the tide goes out said 
peigin barrett spokeswoman for the california marine mammal 
center however we are not sure if its stuck on the rock or 
just wants to stay there 
humphrey a humpback whale spent 25 days in the fall of 1985 
swimming seemingly lost in san francisco bay and the sacramento 
delta before being guided back to the pacific 
rescuers used everything from underwater explosives to recorded 
whale sounds to convince the whale to head for open water 
humphreys earlier visit drew legions of fans and national media 
attention and became became the subject of songs poems books and 
tshirts 
its definitely definitely humphrey barrett said of the 
whale that grounded on a rock shortly after freeing itself from 
mudflats near candlestick park south of downtown 
barrett said the identification was made by ken belcomb of the 
washingtonbased center for whale research whale research through 
distinctive markings humpbacks often are identified by tail 
markings 
the whale measuring 40 feet long and weighing up to 40 tons 
was first spotted in about three feet of water on mudflats near 
us highway 101 traffic backed up a motorists stopped to watch 
the whale not then identified as humphrey struggle then swim 
free as the tide rose 
it then got stuck partly out of the water on the submerged 
rock a short distance offshore rescuers worked to get humphrey 
headed out of the bay and into the ocean they feared it could dry 
out or crush itself by its own massive weight unless completely 
supported by water 
the coast guard kept boats in the area to help out 
belcomb has followed humphreys exploits since the 1985 visit 
since then barrett said humphrey has been spotted in the ocean 
near san francisco every year in august or september 
barrett said that while other species of whale appear in san 
francisco bay it is rare for the endangered humpbacks to do so in 
most cases the animal is hurt or sick she said 
when it was beached there was no observation of any kind of 
mark or injury so we think in all likelihood that if there was 
a problem with it it was internal barrett said adding it was 
very possible the whale was ill

king fahd and president hosni mubarak of egypt met for talks 
monday in jiddah saudi arabia on iraqs occupation of kuwait 
diplomatic sources said as world capitals buzzed with reports that 
the saudis were talking concessions 
on sunday saudi defense minister prince sultan insisted on an 
unconditional iraqi pullout from kuwait but suggested that in the 
postwithdrawal stage negotiations could be held to consider 
iraqs longstanding border dispute with kuwait 
the prince said that rights whether valid or doubtful could 
always be discussed but only after iraqi withdrawal 
some reports quoted sultan as saying arab nations were willing 
to grant iraq all its rights but a reporter for the associated 
press who covered the speech said all rights was not mentioned 
some quarters took the princes remarks as a sign that the 
saudis were ready to agree to territorial concessions by kuwait 
this was a factor in oil prices plunging 541 a barrel on the new 
york mercantile exchange to close at 2838 
before invading kuwait on aug 2 iraq demanded territorial and 
financial concessions from the oilrich emirate including claims 
to the kuwaiti islands of warba and bubiyan on the persian gulf and 
to the rumailah oil field most of the field is in iraq but a 
disputed section runs two miles inside kuwait 
speculation grew so intense about the saudi position that the 
information office of the saudi embassy in washington issued a 
release monday titled clarification of statements made by his 
royal highness prince sultan 
it said that sultan declared to the saudi press agency today 
monday that some news agencies have wrongly interpreted certain 
elements of his speech addressing the arab journalists on sunday 
and their analysis contained a clear distortion of the intended 
meaning 
to clarify the misinterpretation his royal highness said that 
he meant to convey that saudi arabia has in the past through 
good will resolved its respective border problems with iraq 
jordan and the united arab emirates by cordial and mutual 
understanding 
regarding the iraqi aggression on sisterly kuwait the kingdom 
declared its absolute rejection of the said aggression and 
reiterates its total commitment to all arab and international 
resolutions calling upon iraq to immediately completely and 
unconditionally withdraw from kuwaiti territory and restore its 
legitimacy under the leadership of hrh prince jaber alahmed 
alsabah 
the diplomatic sources in saudi arabia speaking on condition of 
not being further identified said fahd and mubarak agreed that 
iraqi withdrawal and restoring the alsabah family rule in kuwait 
could be followed by negotiations on the bilateral disputes that 
preceded the invasion 
mubarak met fahd at the saudi resort of jiddah on the red sea 
the egyptian leader arrived monday and visited egyptian troops 
deployed with multinational troops after iraq invaded kuwait and 
massed troops on the saudi border 
the two agreed that continued iraqi refusal to withdraw from 
kuwait would hurt the arab worlds leading cause the palestinian 
problem the sources said 
they saw that the continued iraqi refusalto respond to peace 
calls will harden the splits in arab ranks and dissipate the arab 
and international concern about the principal arab cases led by the 
palestinian problem and the situation in lebanon one diplomatic 
source said 
mubarak went to the northeastern region of hafr albatin at the 
start of a visit to saudi arabia his first overseas trip since 
iraqs invasion of kuwait he is to go to the united arab emirates 
on tuesday 
at least 14000 egyptian troops are deployed to the 
multinational forces mubarak has said the number might increase 
and maj gen mohammed ali bilal the egyptian commander in the 
kingdom said he expects the size of egypts force here to reach 
20000 by the end of october 
the forces from western islamic arab and gulf countries number 
about 300000 the iraqi force assembled in and around kuwait since 
the invasion has exceeded 400000 
sultan had told a gathering of saudi newspaper editors sunday 
that anything short of an unconditional iraqi pullout from kuwait 
and return of the alsabah family to power is unacceptable and 
rejected by the gulf states in particular and by most of the arab 
and world nations 
he said he was troubled by the suffering trade sanctions were 
causing iraqis but convinced that was a far better thing than war 
it causes us deep pain to see the iraqi or any other nation 
facing a worldwide trade embargo he said but the premise for 
the embargo is peace not war perhaps it is meant to spare the 
shedding of iraqi blood 
prince sultan third in the saudi leadership after fahd and 
crown prince abdullah said the foreign forces amassed following 
the invasion of kuwait brought an umbrella of peace 
he denied any plans to form an arabwestern security alliance in 
the region it is not acceptable that an arab country enters into 
an alliance with a nonarab foreign power he said

oil prices plunged on the world market monday on raised 
prospects for peace in the middle east following a report of a 
dream in which the prophet mohammed supposedly appeared before 
saddam hussein and the saudi defense minister hinted at territorial 
concessions 
an oil price drop for any reason was upbeat news for the us 
economy and more welcome news came from the leader of an 
iraqiamerican group who said saddam will free some sick and 
elderly americans from among the hundreds of us citizens held by 
baghdad since its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
it was not immediately clear when the releases might come or 
how many americans would be affected 
we dont want to talk about figures or names at the moment 
but im happy to announce that some good news will come up said 
salim mansour leader of the marylandbased iraqiamerican 
foundation 
oil prices fell 541 a barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange closing at 2838 the biggest oneday drop in exchange 
history in london north sea brent blend oil plunged 565 a 
barrel to close at 2675 
the prices dropped following reported remarks by saudi arabias 
defense minister sunday that arab nations were willing to grant 
iraq all its rights the market interpreted that as a sign 
saudi arabia was prepared to agree to territorial concessions by 
kuwait 
the same day however prince sultan reiterated that any 
solution must provide for an unconditional iraqi pullout from 
kuwait and the return of the rule of the alsabah family 
a reporter who covered the speech for the associated press said 
the prince declared that rights whether valid or doubtful 
could always be discussed but only after iraqi withdrawal with 
no mention of all rights 
also reported as figuring in the oil price drop was a dream 
president saddam supposedly had the kuwaiti newspaper alseyassah 
said saddam dreamed mohammed appeared before him and told saddam 
iraqs missiles were pointed in the wrong direction the 
missiles are pointed south toward saudi arabia where hundreds of 
thousands of western forces have massed since the invasion 
alseyassah said iraqi intelligence was spreading the story 
around baghdad in an apparent attempt to prepare iraqis 
psychologically for a pullout from kuwait 
the report could not be independently confirmed alseyassah is 
an arm of the ousted government of kuwait and has been trying to 
discredit saddam 
since the persian gulf crisis began oil prices have fluctuated 
wildly on world markets passing 40 a barrel at times compared 
with precrisis levels of 22 a barrel 
in other developments 
the state department said monday that iraqi military forces 
captured most of kuwaits arsenal of us hawk antiaircraft 
missiles and evidently are trying to learn how to use the weapons 
britain said iraqi troops in kuwait rounded up seven more 
british citizens and were to transfer them to iraq 
a handwritten letter from americans and other westerners 
detained at strttegic sites in iraq reached a western embassy on 
monday in baghdad diplomats said in it the captives complained 
about their treatment 
president hosni mubarak of egypt whose country is the leading 
arab contributor to the multinational force visited his troops in 
saudi arabia and met king fahd 
in baghdad mansour leader of the iraqiamerican group said he 
received a commitment from saddam to release americans he said his 
group met the iraqi leader sunday night 
it was not immediately clear whether mansour was referring to 
americans held in both iraq and kuwait which saddam annexed after 
his invasion saddam considers kuwait iraqs 19th province 
about 700 americans are held in kuwait and more than 300 in 
iraq many at strategic sites to deter a possible attack by 
multinational forces 
western diplomatic sources said they had no independent 
confirmation but understood that what mansour is saying could 
turn out to be true 
in washington the state department had no comment 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
understood the americans to be freed were sick or elderly they 
said 47 to 57 american captives fit this category 
saddam also appeared to make concessions to france in a letter 
monday to parliament saddam asked legislators to discuss freeing 
french nationals saying such a move would be a sign of iraqs 
friendship with france 
more than 300 french citizens are held in iraq and kuwait 
french leaders have favored linking a solution to the gulf 
crisis with negotiations between israel and the palestinians over 
israelioccupied territory saddam has tried to make the same 
linkage 
french foreign ministry spokesman daniel bernard said release of 
french nationals was not negotiable 
to enforce the un trade embargo on iraq a multinational naval 
force has been patrolling the gulf it has searched numerous 
commercial ships and in a dozen cases warships have fired shots to 
halt suspected transgressors 
in the latest incident american and australian sailors halted 
and boarded an iraqi freighter albahar alarabi that ignored 
warning shots and defied orders to return to iraq said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
but the ship which fitzwater earlier said was carrying steel 
and plywood was later found without cargo and allowed to continue 
to aden yemen the pentagon said 
it said it assumed the crew dumped the cargo over the side

george armelagos sees nothing sick 
about his hobby collecting airline barf bags 
the university of florida anthropologist has more than 100 
unused barf bags of varying sizes designs and colors on the 
bulletin board of his office 
all artifacts of a culture give clues about a way of life 
he said barf bags which after all represent food and sickness 
shoud be no different 
the british airways bag gives terribly proper instructions if 
used for air sickness please hand to the cabin crew for 
disposal 
in other words dont leave it on the seat armelagos said 
armelagos favorite bag from klm airlines depicts a kangaroo 
throwing up in his pouch it reads for a clean feeling 
air afriques barf bag is decorated with gold masks aero perus 
with archaeological symbols passengers can play gin rummy on the 
gameboard on a twa barf bag or use the kodak ad on an american 
airlines bag to get their film developed 
one of the biggest problems in collecting barf bags now is 
that more and more airlines are starting to use generics 
armelagos said i feel cheated when i get on a plane and find the 
same barf bag that i saw on some other flight

the cincinnati reds sweep of the oakland as in 
the world series cost cbs a bundle 
oakland lost the series in four straight games meaning cbs 
which paid 108 billion for the rights to four years of baseball 
lost the revenue from three unplayed games and had only 14 of a 
potential 21 postseason games to broadcast 
industry estimates put the loss as high as 150 million 
we could use a little better luck for sure said cbs sports 
president neal pilson who put the loss significantly lower 
under 100 million is i think a reasonable guess at this 
point 
john reidy a media analyst for smith barney estimated cbs 
overall fourthquarter loss at more than 50 million with an 
overall loss for the year of about 100 million 
if they had gotten three more games we figure they could have 
had an increased contribution to their profits on the order of 15 
million to 20 million without too much difficulty reidy said 
in 1990 all major sports contracts were up for renewal and cbs 
was looking to break out of its thirdplace primetime standing 
with aggressive bidding 
cbs 108 billion for baseball was part of a 36 billion 
package for nfl football ncaa tournament basketball and the next 
two winter olympics 
they bid up the price of primetime sports too high to support 
the business thats out there said john rohr a programming 
analyst for blair television advertising representative for tv 
stations theres a lot more supply nowadays than there is 
demand 
the network boasted that 1990 would be a dream season with 
its would broadcasts of the super bowl basketballs final four 
college championships and the pros nba championships the allstar 
game tennis us open and the world series 
the dream season turned into a nightmare of blowouts sweeps 
and rain delays said cbs spokeswoman susan kerr 
in the super bowl the san francisco 49ers obliterated the 
denver broncos 5510 the university of las vegas won the final 
four in a 10373 blowout of duke university and the nbas detroit 
pistons won their title in five games 
these are things we cant control pilson said 
cbs baseball dream began going bad when the owners lockout 
delayed the season for nearly a month rain delayed the allstar 
game for more than an hour pushing the final innings into the 
small hours 
all of our sports including baseball up through the world 
series performed better than projected in terms of the bottom 
line pilson said but what we ran into was a fourthquarter 
softness in the overall economy it wasnt just television and it 
wasnt just sports television 
baseballs truncated playoffs hurt the first national league 
playoff game between pittsburgh and cincinnati was the lowestrated 
in history ratings for the six primetime playoff games declined 
10 percent from last year 
this years world series ratings were better than last years 
earthquakedelayed championship which got an alltime low rating 
of 164 mostly because both teams came from the same smaller media 
market 
the 90 series overnight ratings averaged 213 up about 25 
percent over last year but still secondlowest since night games 
were added in 1971 
oakland and cincinnati are not new york or lasize markets 
no disrespect to oakland or cincinnati but the only thing i can 
think of that would be worse for a series would be toronto versus 
montreal rohr said

roughly 150 dozen times on this typical 
day debbie slade will check the seams the snaps the fabric and 
the measurements of baby pajamas before sticking on her signature 
inspected by no 6 
but then life is full of inspections 
shes got exams to think about in her night classes shes got 
to keep the pounds off working out on the exercise bike her 
husband bought her and in a year or two she hopes to have that 
first granddaughter the families are looking for 
everybodys pushing us to have that granddaughter its all 
boys inspector no 6 says amid the clatter of sewing cutting 
and fastening machines in the gerber childrenswear plant a box of 
three dozen completed outfits has just been added to the 
neverfinished pile next to her 4by6foot work table 
this time theyre hotpink affairs tiny fashion sleepers 
shell get to that box next visualizing the wearer you can just 
picture the little girl with the little bows and everything she 
says 
inspector no 6 laughs but she doesnt pause hands tugging 
seams and probing terrycloth toes she works at what seems a 
doubletime pace like nearly everyone at the plant where pay is 
usually by the piece 
the infant clothes are created by dozens of seamstresses arrayed 
in rows in a room the size of a football field some wear stereo 
earphones to drown the sewing machines whir and the snare 
drumlike cracks as gripper girls pound metal snaps into place 
some talk over the noise 
peggy you feelin good today 
im feeling all right 
some spend all day making nothing but collars others nothing 
but sleeves or cuffs to be passed along to the next seamstress 
who with a quick arc of stitches attaches that part to the evolving 
garment 
by the time all the pattern pieces finally come together as 
pajamas theyve reached 28yearold debbie slade and the other 
100 percent inspectors 
insideout and unsnapped the outfits quickly are reversed 
snapped checked and sent by the inspectors on their way in one of 
three directions 
most go toward the packagers to be placed in boxes marked 
crafted with pride in the usa others go back to sewing 
machines to have minor irregularities mended some with faded 
fabric or a leg thats too wide go to the seconds box 
first however the outfits that pass inspection go to frances 
martin the plants quality assurance manager years ago she was 
inspector no 10 at another plant 
all day she roves among the seamstresses checking 
occasionally turning a garment back to be resewn but frances 
sandra brake jokingly protests from behind her machine i crafted 
it with pride 
occasionally theres some friction when a garment is rejected 
acknowledges quality control executive david sanders thats 
because the piecework seamstress loses production time you 
cant make money doing repairs he says 
mrs martin also inspects the inspectors sending reports on to 
sanders she pulls a set percentage of outfits from the dozens they 
examine and gets out her ruler to make sure theyre meeting 
specifications 
sleeve 10 inches long neck 5 inches across another 
inspection for inspector no 6 on this day her sheet in mrs 
martins log shows a perfect score 
most people when they ask me what do you do and i say 
im an inspector they say do you inspect hanes you know 
the underwear inspector no 6 says laughing again recalling 
the television commercial of a few years ago 
in it a nononsense inspector no 12 tugs the elastic of briefs 
before growling into the camera they dont say hanes until i say 
they say hanes 
inspector no 6 feels similiarly proprietary 
with sharp nippers that have left scars on her fingertips in 
five years at this job she cuts extraneous threads while telling a 
story 
a new mother wrote a letter complaining about an uncut string 
an inconsequential matter until it gets wrapped around a babys 
toe the infant wasnt hurt but mrs slade says the message 
registered it was a dangerous thing she says 
plant managers pass such problems back to those assigned to 
catch them whose inspector label turned up isnt mentioned they 
just talk to all of us about it no 6 says and shes not 
smiling now 
tell me if its mine she says i know i put labels in 
mine cause i want to know 
debbie slade doesnt plan to be inspector no 6 forever shes 
closing in on a degree in fashion merchandise and marketing 
whatll she do next become a buyer for a store stay with 
gerber shes not sure but the clothing business is in her blood 
now 
im the type she says that when i buy something i 
inspect it now even for myself i want to know what im 
getting

tired of living like a starving artist 
oslos munch museum is putting its collection up for adoption 
the director of the cityowned museum for works by norwegian 
artist edvard munch hopes companies and individuals will pay 
between 833 and 16500 plus annual support payments for one 
of a selection of 1100 paintings 
the donors however will only have visiting rights because all 
works will remain in the museum 
museum director alf boe said the money is needed to expand and 
modernize the 27yearold building the first appeals were expected 
to be mailed today 
finances in norways capital city have been strained by a 
national economic slump not even the sale of some works fattened 
the museums coffers enough for the project 
oslos budget is so thin that we are completely dependent on 
getting some extra income boe said monday at a news conference 
held in a cafe munch once called his livingroom 
the cafe claims it kept munch from starving by stretching his 
credit a very long way 
munchs work was a primary inspiration for german 
expressionists his dreamlike and often violent style explored 
such themes as isolation fear and death 
when he died in 1944 munch left paintings sketches and 
lithographs to his native city of oslo called christiania when 
munch was born in 1863 
boe said appeals to adopt the paintings would be sent to 
companies beginning today the cry for help is accompanied by a 
postcard featuring the shriek munchs famous 1893 painting 
we cant expect all of them to be adopted said boe who 
noted numerous norwegian firms and a japanese company have 
expressed an interest in adopting boe said there will be no 
placards saying who adopted the works 
the director refused to guess how much the adoption might raise 
but said the museum needs 25 million for an addition and 83 
million for renovations including a coldstorage room to keep 
prints from deteriorating 
boe said the museum also needs funds to rebuild its staff cut 
from a peak of 65 to 47

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani is 
intensifying his purge of antiwestern radical rivals in a power 
struggle that looks to be heating up against the backdrop of the 
persian gulf crisis 
the outcome at this stage does not seem to be in doubt 
rafsanjani is gradually consolidating his power 
but he needs to force the pace to maintain the momentum of his 
effort to liberalize irans economy and society after the june 1989 
death of revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
rafsanjani leader of the socalled pragmatists is seeking to 
improve the quality of life for irans 55 million people to cement 
his popularity he also seeks to rebuild bridges with the west and 
the arabs 
but rearguard actions by the radicals can slow down his campaign 
and jeopardize his strategy 
rafsanjanis latest target is mehdi karrubi hardline speaker of 
the 270member majlis or parliament 
the majlis is dominated by the radicals and with elections at 
least 18 months away rafsanjani has to do something to contain 
them 
since the death of khomeini who was known as the imam 
rafsanjani has systematically removed many radicals and 
ultraconservative clerics from the government and key 
institutions 
this reactionary tendency has grown since the imams demise 
and is now coveting total power radical parliamentarian abbas 
douzdouzani declared last week it is feared that it will destroy 
all revolutionary achievements and aspirations under the guise of 
religious rules and put americanstyle islam in control 
rafsanjanis supporters now control the 12member council of 
guardians which screens legislation to ensure it conforms to 
islamic tenets and the 13man expediency council established by 
khomeini to resolve legislative issues 
earlier this month rafsanjani gained control of the 83member 
assembly of experts one of the most important institutions in 
iran through a piece of political trickery that has enraged the 
hardliners 
ayatollah ali khamenei khomeinis successor as spiritual 
leader has also come under heavy criticism for siding with 
rafsanjani the radicals say hes unfit to be khomeinis successor 
because he lacks islamic credentials 
the radicals claim to be khomeinis true heirs and accuse 
rafsanjani and khamenei of straying from khomeinis teachings 
the iraqbased iranian opposition group mujahedeen khalq or 
peoples holy warriors say khamenei has threatened to use his 
constitutional powers and dissolve parliament if attacks against 
him continue 
their claim could not be independently confirmed but sources in 
tehran have said rafsanjani made similar threats when the radicals 
tried to block his fiveyear economic plan in january 
iraqs invasion of kuwait has strengthened rafsanjanis hand 
higher oil prices are earning iran an extra 35 million a day 
badly needed for his drive to revive the economy 
saddam hussein was forced to make peace with iran his foe in a 
198088 war withdraw from captured territory and share sovereignty 
of the shattalarab waterway which forms part of the iraniraq 
border and was iraqs lone outlet to the persian gulf before it 
seized kuwait 
but the american military intervention in the region coupled 
with iranian suspicions that the troops could remain indefinitely 
even if saddam quits kuwait has given radicals a political boost 
the radicals remain deeply entrenched in the bureaucracy and 
revolutionary institutions such as the security committees which 
control life in the streets 
karrubi a middleranking cleric known for his aggressive 
fundamentalism has emerged as one of the governments chief 
antagonists 
authorities arrested his brother hassan on corruption charges 
last month 
last week khamenei ordered ali yunessi tehrans public 
prosecutor to investigate the multimilliondollar martyrs 
foundation which karrubi heads 
the foundation which looks after the families of men killed in 
the war has become a virtual conglomerate running companies real 
estate and other assets expropriated from supporters of the late 
shah mohammad reza pahlavi after the 1979 islamic revolution 
in an open letter to ayatollah yussof saneie a senior 
hardliner who the radicals say is more qualified than khamenei to 
be spiritual leader karrubi called khamenei and the moderates 
devourers of the imams legacy 
the feud sharpened earlier this month over the elections for the 
assembly of experts the hardliners had sought to win enough seats 
to replace khamenei with a radical troika led by saneie 
but khamenei and rafsanjani cut the hardliners out by changing 
the rules for candidates and making them undergo examinations to 
test their knowledge of islamic religious teachings 
many radicals who had announced their candidacy like karrubi 
refused to take the test most of those who did were flunked 
giving rafsanjanis supporters an easy victory

in a county where fence posts outnumber 
people the signs on the posts tell what people are thinking 
boyd county held hostage dump the dump queen and 
pinnochiorr 
they arent the only blemishes on the pastoral landscape in the 
sparsely populated ranchland among the rolling foothills of the 
niobrara river in northeastern nebraska 
since a developer named a site near butte last december as its 
choice for a fivestate lowlevel radioactive waste warehouse a 
rancher who opposes the dump has staged a 30day hunger strike and 
gov kay orr has received a death threat 
the dump has divided neighbors and even families in boyd county 
a slice of farm country along the south dakota line about 200 miles 
north of lincoln and now it has become part of the governors 
race between mrs orr the nations first republican woman to be 
elected governor and her democratic challenger ben nelson 
mrs orr has been called pinnochiorr after the storybook 
puppet whose nose grew when he lied she supports the dump but 
opponents say she lies by saying that most community residents 
agree with her 
nelson who opposes the dump has been accused of making 
political hay out of the situation 
nebraska is one of the states farthest along on the road to 
complying with a federal law that requires all states to dispose of 
their own lowlevel radioactive waste by jan 1 1993 
the law allows states to form associations to dispose of the 
waste nebraska belongs to the central interstate lowlevel 
radioactive waste compact with arkansas kansas louisiana and 
oklahoma 
nelson and other opponents say there is some doubt that the 
nation needs more dumps they also say that only california and 
nebraska appear to be trying to comply with federal guidelines 
mrs orrs legal aide bud cuca said the governor wants to 
introduce measures in the january legislative session to ensure 
that other states have complied with federal law before nebraska 
issues a license for the dump 
the state has already begun a yearlong review of the license 
application by us ecology 
earlier this month mrs orr said she wouldnt be campaigning in 
boyd county which has about 3000 residents because she had 
received a death threat the nebraska state patrol said it was 
investigating the letter that mrs orr received last august 
i dont believe that gov kay orr is afraid to come to boyd 
county i think she is ashamed to come to boyd county said jim 
selle a founder of the antidump group save boyd county and member 
of a monitoring committee appointed to oversee development of the 
waste site 
some boyd county officials have welcomed the money the dump may 
bring opponents have said they fear accidents and longterm 
effects of the waste 
you have a county with one great big broken heart and nobody 
seems to care said lowell fisher of spencer a town about 10 
miles from the waste site 
fisher 50 lost 36 pounds when he staged a monthlong hunger 
strike that began sept 17 
he declined to say why he ended his fast thursday or if he 
considered the battle against the dump to be lost 
fisher says there are children in boyd county who no longer 
speak to their parents because of disagreements over the dump dump 
officials say one of the regular protesters at the fencedin site 
is the father of one of the guards hired to protect it 
guards have complained that they have been harassed barbed wire 
on fences has been cut and tire spikes have been found on work 
roads jim neal a us ecology spokesman says residents near the 
project who support it have had their fences cut and their cattle 
have gotten loose 
last month a grand jury noted the difficulty of finding people 
for a monitoring committee to oversee work at the site the reason 
nearly everyone in the county had too strong an opinion to take an 
objective view

americans holed up in the us embassy 
fight boredom by watching old war movies on video playing chess 
and pumping iron mostly they try to keep their spirits up 
they are among more than 1000 americans prevented from leaving 
iraq and kuwait because saddam husseins government wants human 
shields against attacks by the usled multinational forces in the 
persian gulf 
about 600 foreigners including 104 americans have been taken 
to strategic locations in iraq that would be most vulnerable to air 
attacks according to diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the americans are among several thousand foreigners stranded or 
held in iraq since saddams forces seized kuwait on aug 2 saddam 
calls them guests who will remain in iraq until the clouds 
roll by and the sky once again becomes clear 
we understand that the americans have been scattered 
everywhere practically at every strategic location said an 
asian diplomat we know that some of them are sick probably 
suffering from diarrhea he added he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the hostages at the sites have been denied visits by officials 
from their embassies and are being moved from place to place 
sources said 
we want to start a mail service where we can forward and 
receive mail from them said william armbruster 37 a us 
diplomat at the embassy 
the embassy is also printing a weekly newsletter giving 
summaries of world news and football and baseball results 
were handing over these papers to the iraqis requesting them 
to forward them armbruster said 
some americans and other foreigners stranded in baghdad are ill 
and urgently need medical care 
i have 48 documented cases said laurence vellekoop an 
american doctor who had been assigned to the us embassy in 
kuwait like many other americans he left kuwait for iraq after 
the invasion 
vellekoop said some of the trapped americans suffer from serious 
heart disorders ulcers diabetes and severe backaches one 
american said he is anxious to leave because his 80yearold mother 
is going blind 
salim mansour leader of an americaniraqi delegation that met 
with saddam said monday he received a commitment from the iraqi 
leadership to release some ailing and elderly americans 
we dont want to talk about figures or names at the moment 
but im happy to announce that some good news will come up 
mansour said 
about 650 americans were living in iraq when saddams forces 
captured the ermirate as many as 2700 americans were working in 
kuwait some americans received iraqi permission to leave and 
others found their own way out 
embassy officials decline to say how many americans remain in 
iraq and kuwait or how many have taken refuge in the us embassy 
but there are believed to be 54 diplomats and dependents in the 
us compound 
two iraqi soldiers keep watch outside the walled embassy and the 
us information service office across the street iraqi secret 
service agents note who visits the embassy 
the americans living in the embassy compound and embassy 
residences are free to move around the city but most prefer to 
stay close to home 
i dont feel unsafe said armbruster theres very little 
antiamericanism in the streets perhaps thats the contribution of 
arab hospitality 
but no one talks to us as its illegal its dangerous for 
iraqis to talk to foreign diplomats 
on the streets young men occasionally chant down down 
bush when they spot an american reporter 
a 6weekold motherless kitten has become the americans mascot 
the striped gray kitten named bosh after the way iraqis 
pronounce president bushs name was found in the embassy garden by 
an iraqi secretary 
bosh will find a new home in minneapolis if and when we make 
it said vellekoop bosh would probably die if i leave him 
here

capital his brother who was a marine guard in kuwait is trapped 
in baghdad

christian i know the training he went through as a brother i 
know he is a strong man 
randy 27 said paul had been at the us embassy in kuwait for 
seven months when iraq invaded on aug 2 
when randy was deployed near the saudi arabia border two weeks 
later paul was less than 100 miles away in kuwait 
since then contact between the brothers has been spotty 
filtered by distance and delayed by military mail 
he called my sister to say things were pretty shaky and then 
they the ftamily read in he newspaper that americans were taken 
from the embassy to iraq randy said 
he said paul and other american officials were allowed to move 
freely within a limited radius of the us embassy in baghdad only 
civilians are being held at strategic sites as part of saddam 
husseins human shield against attack 
paul sent a letter out sept 14 with the rev jesse jackson and 
he has been able to call his family in orlando fla the brothers 
father the rev george rodriguez is pastor of the spanish church 
of god 
randy rodriguez joined the marines in 1981 and served at 
embassies in uruguay the united arab emirates and mexico before 
joining the 1st force support services group which ended up in the 
1st marine expeditionary force in saudi arabia 
paul joined four years later and the brothers tried to stay 
close 
lets see randy said checking his watch last year at 
this time we were vacationing together in kenya paul had been at 
the us embassy in nairobi 
the wait is hardest on the brothers teenage sister randy 
said but the whole family is holding up well 
i pray for them more than my brother they all have a strong 
christian faith strong beliefs he said 
everything suggests that paul is in high spirits on the other 
side of the frontlines he added 
rodriguez supervises fueling operations at a desert outpost 
were the local 7eleven he said with a light chuckle 
theres not much else without us nobody eats moves or 
shoots 
at quiet moments rodriguez plays scrabble writes letters and 
prays for his brother as always there is the constant game of 
guessing what happens next 
were just waiting on our boss he said i dont know what 
will happen but i dont see leaving here peacefully 
if it becomes necessary to call air strikes on baghdad 
rodriguez said the family is confident 
the last thing my brother shared with me was a verse from 
psalms 14520 that for those who love the lord the wicked will be 
destroyed he said shifting easily from wry humor to quiet 
thoughtfulness 
this doesnt worry me he concluded if i dont see my 
brother again i know ill see him later

sarit bakshi left a jewish settlement in the 
west bank to escape the palestinian uprising but the uprising 
followed her 
a knifewielding arab walked into the jewish neighborhood of 
baka at breakfast time sunday and stabbed three israelis to death 
one of them outside mrs bakshis house 
i moved here to get away from the stones and now every morning 
i have to open my shutters and see blood she said 
the people in baka were angry and scared monday extra police 
were on the streets to prevent attacks on arabs and also were 
outside the house of a neighborhood moderate who drew his 
neighbors wrath 
more suspicion and tension clouded baka when people awoke monday 
to find the tires slashed on 35 cars arab saboteurs jewish 
provocateurs nobody knows 
stone walls were plastered with blackbordered death notices for 
sundays victims soldier iris azulai gardener eli eltratz and 
offduty policeman charles chelouche 
downtown police were questioning the suspected assailant a 
19yearold arab laborer named omar abu sirhan they said he was 
seeking vengeance for the killings of palestinians 
this is the first time a man died in my arms and it was a 
terrible thing said daniel marciano an unemployed tenement 
dweller who heard screaming and came out to offer aid 
he pointed to a dark patch of blood soaked into the pavement and 
said 
yesterday a jew was lying here another over there on the 
other side a soldier it was a horrible thing take a look today 
calm believe me if an arab would come no one would hurt him we 
are merciful jews 
baka straddles the bethlehem road leading to christs 
birthplace it was an arab district until it became part of the new 
state of israel in 1948 and although most arabs fled it kept its 
arab name 
its majestic arab houses with exquisitely carved limestone have 
attracted jerusalems yuppies joining other jews who had fled arab 
countries and settled in israel 
today baka is considered a microcosm of israel itself 
the palestinian uprising effectively divided jerusalem few jews 
venture into the arab sector without good reason at the same time 
the feeling has grown that jewish jerusalem is safe sundays 
bloodshed shook that conviction 
i thought it was impossible for it to happen here and it is a 
devastating experience i mean it could have been me this is my 
neighborhood and its very very scary said rabbi levi 
weimankelman who moved here 15 years ago from new york 
a survivor of sundays rampage was 13yearold amikam kovner 
who sustained head injuries and needed eight stitches 
his father michael a painter sat at the kitchen table of his 
renovated arab home while amikam back from hospital played with a 
friend 
michael kovners father was abba kovner a jewish poet and 
ghetto fighter against the nazis who came to israel after world war 
ii 
did michael kovner see any link between his fathers travails 
and his sons narrow escape kovner thought and concluded it was 
a part of the total fabric of our existence 
judy labensohn a writer said that the night before the attack 
baka residents had finished turning an abandoned lot into a 
playground and celebrated with a bonfire 
it pulled us all together and then boom we didnt even have 
24 hours to enjoy it she said 
mrs bakshi said her 4yearold daughter saw one of the 
killings at this age she already knows what a corpse is 
thats the thing about jerusalem said mrs labensohn the 
physical space has a feeling of serenity but its anything but 
serene that is the illusion of jerusalem 
even if you can see the smoke of tires burning in the arab 
sections of towns you could have still said thats over there 
baka has always been so calm and peaceful its hard to believe it 
happened here in our front yards

spurred by protests from western states the 
senate late monday rejected a proposed oneyear ban on selling 
federal land containing gold silver and other hardrock minerals 
to mining companies for as little as 250 an acre 
the proposed temporary moratorium on issuing cheap titles to 
federal mining land was sponsored by sen dale bumpers dark who 
called the practice a flagrant giveaway of public land and the 
biggest scam still going on in america 
western senators led by sen harry reid dnev said bumpers 
proposal would devastate the us mining industry and stifle 
economic development in the west 
the bumpers proposal was defeated 5048 as the senate debated an 
117 billion appropriations bill for the interior department and 
several other federal agencies from the forest service to the 
smithsonian institution 
a similar moratorium was previously approved by the house in its 
version of the money bill differences will have to be reconciled 
later by house and senate negotiators 
under an 1872 law intended to encourage settlement of the west 
a miner can file a claim on federal land and sell its minerals 
without paying royalties to the government so long as the miner 
performs 100 worth of work annually 
miners can acquire title to the land for 250 to 5 an acre 
with proof that a valuable deposit has been found and 500 worth of 
work has been performed the government receives no royalties 
lease fees or bonuses when the minerals are sold and there are no 
restrictions on use or sale of the land after title is obtained by 
the miner 
bumpers said he sought the moratorium to give congress time to 
consider reforming the 1872 law including proposals to prohibit 
the sale of federal land and create a system of titles for mineral 
deposits only bumpers also seeks provisions for payment of 
royalties and land reclamation 
sen ted stevens ralaska said it was plain baloney to 
call the current system a public land giveaway as bumpers charged 
this is a rotten deal said sen william l armstrong 
rcolo an opponent of the moratorium proposal this is a rotten 
deal for the american taxpayers retorted bumpers 
bumpers said a recent general accounting office study of 20 
sales since 1970 showing that federal land worth as much as 47 
million was sold for 4500 under the law 
sen james mcclure ridaho said the study by the gao the 
investigative arm of congress was a piece of junk riddled with 
inaccuracies and that bumpers arguments were long on emotion 
and short on facts

democrats are likely to bolster their majority 
of governorships this year but face tough republican resistance in 
three sunbelt states crucial to congressional redistricting 
a statebystate associated press survey showed democrats with 
credible challenges to six gop governors and running strong races 
in four other states where republican governors are retiring 
by contrast no incumbent democratic governor appears seriously 
threatened republicans have high hopes in six states where 
democratic governors are not seeking reelection 
all told the ap survey found 14 races for governor and seven 
senate contests too close to call 
entering the campaign the democrats controlled the senate by a 
margin of 55 to 45 of the nations governors 29 are democrats and 
21 republicans 
in the senate races democratic incumbents claiborne pell of 
rhode island daniel akaka of hawaii and tom harkin of iowa and 
john kerry of massachusetts are threatened as are republicans mark 
hatfield of oregon and jesse helms of north carolina in new 
hampshire where republican sen gordon humphrey is retiring 
former sen john durkin a democrat and gop rep bob smith are in 
a close race to succeed him 
the great unknown this midterm election year is the impact of 
voter discontent a factor leaders of both parties agree exists to 
an unusually high degree 
the mood is bad and getting worse said democratic pollster 
geoff garin he cited the budget fiasco which he said 
confirms every worst suspicion people have about the political 
system 
garin predicted that some incumbents whove ecome complacent 
because of their easy elections in the 80s are going to end up out 
of work 
the race with the highest stakes is for governor of california 
where democrat dianne feinstein and republican pete wilson are 
running neck and neck to succeed gop gov george deukmejian who is 
retiring after two terms 
based on preliminary census figures california will gain seven 
new us house seats in 1992 if feinstein is elected governor the 
democrats will draw the new district lines without interference 
from republicans 
wilson reelected to the us senate in 1988 was recruited to 
run for governor as the best chance the gop had to retain that seat 
and the veto power over any redistricting plan drawn by the 
democratic legislature 
recent independent polls give wilson a narrow lead well within 
the margin of error the rivals agree on many issues including 
their support of abortion and the death penalty both are former 
mayors he of san diego she of san francisco 
redistricting also is a major stake in races for governor in 
florida and texas the other big winners when more house seats 
shift to the sunbelt in 1992 
texas where republican gov william clements is retiring is 
likely to gain three new house seats 
republican millionaire clayton williams seemed well on his way 
to victory over democrat ann richards in texas but last week a new 
poll said richards had moved to within 5 points of williams whose 
repeated verbal gaffes may be cutting into his support 
in florida which could gain four house seats republican gov 
bob martinez got into trouble over taxes early in his first term 
and then found his hardline antiabortion stand was also costing 
him support former democratic sen lawton chiles got into the race 
and led in most polls recently the margin has narrowed and 
martinez has a big edge in money 
other republican governors with tough opponents are alabama gov 
guy hunt who is leading teachers union official paul hubbert 
nebraska gov kay orr who is trailing businessman ben nelson 
kansas gov mike hayden who is in a dead heat with state treasurer 
joan finney maine gov john mckernan who trails former democratic 
gov joseph brennan and rhode island gov edward diprete who is 
running far behind businessman bruce sundlun 
minnesota was the state where republicans had high hopes of 
defeating democratic incumbent rudy perpich but those hopes faded 
abruptly when two young women alleged that gop candidate jon 
grunseth swam nude with four teenage girls at a 1981 party 
grunseth denied the allegations and took a lie detector test he 
vowed to stay in the race and accused perpich of being behind the 
allegations 
in vermont former gov richard snelling is favored to regain 
the office he gave up six years ago and return that state to 
republican control republican arliss sturgulewski is leading in a 
threeway race for governor of alaska where democratic incumbent 
steve cowper is retiring tony knowles is the democratic nominee 
and former gop gov walter hickel is running as an independent 
in oregon john frohnmayer the republican state attorney 
general is in a tight race against democrat barbara roberts while 
the massachusetts race between democrat john silber and republican 
wlliam weld also is a tossup 
former cleveland mayor george voinovich a republican is 
leading democrat tony celebrezze in the race to succeed democrat 
richard celeste as governor of ohio 
democrat david walters and republican bill price are accusing 
each other of dirty campaigning in the race to succeed republican 
gov henry bellmon of oklahoma price also is attacking walters as 
a liberal who tried to ram michael dukakis down the throats of 
oklahomans in the 1988 presidential election 
these are the top senate races 
north carolina harvey gantt the black former mayor of 
charlotte is giving helms the toughest race of his career 
independent polls say the race is a dead heat gantt and helms 
differ on just about every issue 
iowa democrat tom harkin is battling republican rep tom tauke 
as well as an iowa tradition of not reelecting democratic 
senators polls show harkin consistently in the lead but his edge 
is often well within the margin of error 
oregon republican mark hatfield bidding for a fifth term may 
be the best example of a complacent incumbent democratic 
businessman harry lonsdale hammered away at hatfield for months and 
the senator ignored the challenge until a recent poll showed 
lonsdale had climbed to within 6 points of the incumbent 
hawaii generally regarded as the best chance for the 
republicans to pick up a democratic seat democrat daniel akaka was 
appointed to the senate last summer after sen spark matsunaga 
died a lackluster campaigner who held a safe house seat for seven 
terms akaka is opposed by republican rep pat saiki even hawaii 
democrats conceded that saiki is a far more dynamic campaigner and 
has a strong chance to win in this heavily democratic state 
massachusetts sen john kerry was considered a shooin for 
reelection in this heavily democratic state until the voters 
expressed their rage in the sept 18 primary suddenly independent 
polls said the race between kerry and his republican challenger 
jim rappaport was a dead heat 
rhode island democrat claiborne pell was elected to the senate 
in 1960 the year john f kennedy was elected president he is 
challenged by 43yearold rep claudine schneider politely but 
firmly schneider suggests it is time for a younger person to take 
pells seat 
new hampshire gop rep bob smith was heavily favored to 
capture the senate seat being vacated by fellow conservative gordon 
humphrey but former sen john durkin has made a race of it and a 
recent poll said smiths 4point lead was within the margin of 
error

the sheriff who hauled members of 2 
live crew into court on obscenity charges warned that despite their 
acquittal the rappers risk arrest again if they give another 
concert in his bailiwick 
a broward county jury saturday acquitted three members of the 
group of obscenity over an adultsonly performance june 10 at a 
hollywood nightclub 
luther campbell mark brother marquis ross and chris fresh 
kid ice wongwon could have received up to a year in jail and a 
1000 fine 
sheriff nick navarro said sunday he still considers songs from 
the groups as nasty as they wanna be album illegal and he 
warned band members against keeping their pledge to give another 
concert in broward county 
if it is in broward county they will be arrested navarro 
said 
navarro noted that a federal judge and another broward county 
jury had found the album obscene nothing has changed until 
those decisions are reversed by a higher court that is the law in 
broward county he said 
jurors said their verdict was almost instantaneous 
we found many of the things very humorous said beverly 
resnick 65 our feelings were the musicians in the band were 
telling the public how they felt inside of themselves and they 
were doing it with music we thought it had some art in it 
juror helena bailie 76 a retired sociology professor said the 
bands performance despite threats of arrest may have been an act 
of political defiance maybe the band felt threatened and they 
were thumbing their noses back she said 
as the crosssection of the community that we are it was just 
not obscene said foreman david garsow 24 
the arrests came four days after a federal judge pronounced the 
album obscene the record includes references to oral and anal sex 
and sexual violence against women 
earlier this month record store owner charles freeman was 
convicted of obscenity for selling nasty 
freeman who is black called saturdays verdict true 
justice and blamed his conviction on an allwhite jury 
saturdays jury had one black member 2 live crew had a 
crosssection for a jury and i didnt he said 
the owner of the nightclub where the rap group played offered 
the place to 2 live crew again saying authorities should 
concentrate on street crime and drugs its time to go on to 
bigger and better things said ken geringer owner of club

columbus growing prosperity has been accompanied by an increase in 
violence 
a bullet fired from a passing car two months ago shattered the 
skull of jasper moffit jr as he stood outside the store on the 
near east side 
what really hurt us was that our son got shot dead in front of 
us and there was nothing we could do to help him said his 
mother cynthia moffitt 
the moffitt business is an example of how the citys prosperity 
has reached into some of its poorest neighborhoods but the slaying 
aug 25 points to a jump in violent crime that belies the state 
capitals image as a sedate midwestern city known more for bigtime 
college football than bigcity crime 
the violence comes at a time when national publications are 
touting columbus as a good place to do business 
i think it is a combination of drugs and other things said 
police sgt ralph casto its just probably an unanswerable 
question as far as being able to say specifically what the 
increase of crime is caused by 
during just one recent weekend a pipe bomb killed an 8yearold 
in his home an 11yearold girl was shot in the head while sitting 
in a car at a restaurant the body of a man in his early 20s was 
dumped from a car and a bullet pierced the abdomen of a woman who 
was eight months pregnant killing the baby 
the metropolitan area also has been hit by more than 100 bank 
robberies since january thats 24 more than last year and more 
than all the bank robberies in metropolitan cleveland and 
cincinnati combined 
law enforcement officials attribute the increase in bank 
robberies to the large number of branches built to serve the citys 
ballooning population 
its the way this city is growing its just exploding said 
douglass c ogden agent in charge of the fbis columbus office 
preliminary 1990 census figures indicate columbus surpassed 
cleveland as ohios largest city growing about 10 percent since 
1980 to 622500 
in 1976 police counted 53 homicides 328 rapes and 985 
aggravated assaults last year 89 homicides 534 rapes and 1898 
aggravated assaults were recorded although police say overall 
crime decreased in 1989 for the first time since 1985 
people used to talk about cleveland being bad said annie 
kate freeman a columbus resident since 1969 they used to give 
columbus praise but they cant do it now because columbus has 
gotten really bad 
but national publications have praised columbus 
fortune magazine this month ranked it among the top 10 locations 
for business citing the citys affordable housing and good 
schools in an economically diverse city 
a world trade magazine panel called columbus one of the 10 best 
secondtier cities for international companies and the august 
issue of money magazine rated columbus businesses as showing the 
fourthbest stock performance among companies in the nations 40 
biggest cities 
in august the wall street journal called columbus one of the 
few growing metropolitan areas in a slowgrowth region it said 
the city has become a magnet for artists actors musicians and 
bohemians

operation desert shield has lifted the spirits 
of a us military battered by budget cuts and the demise of the 
cold war but one segment of the armed forces sees the persian gulf 
buildup as a slap in the face 
combat units of the army national guard have been excluded from 
the force deployments which now total more than 200000 personnel 
in the gulf area including more than 34000 noncombat reserves 
from the army navy air force and marine corps 
were trained and were ready said beryl diamond a 
spokesman for the georgia army national guard whose 48th infantry 
brigade was left behind when the two activeduty brigades with 
which it trains headed off for saudi arabia last month 
it was disappointing to troops who had trained for a 
mission diamond said 
as in many of the other active divisions in the us army the 
48th serves as a roundout brigade for the 24th mechanized 
infantry division based at fort stewart ga but when the pentagon 
deployed the 24th to saudi arabia it substituted an active brigade 
the 197th at fort benning ga instead of sending the 48th 
the 155th armored brigade of the mississippi army national 
guard which rounds out the 1st cavalry division from fort hood 
texas also was left cooling its heels when the division shipped 
out for the saudi desert this month the pentagon chose to fill out 
the 1st cavalry with an active brigade of the 2nd armored division 
the controversy is growing now that the pentagon is preparing to 
rotate fresh troops into saudi arabia to replace those that have 
been there from the start 
no final decisions have been made but the services are expected 
to set persian gulf duty limits of six months president bush 
ordered the gulf buildup on aug 8 
that means the pentagon again faces the question of whether to 
use combat reserves which are available under federal law for 
sixmonth stints the alternative would be to again deploy nnly 
active units 
the pentagons initial decision not to deploy the 48th and other 
combat reserve units has raised fundamental questions about the 
role of reserves in the us armed forces 
if we do not use the reserves when they are required why have 
a reserve said bill legg director of naval affairs at the 
reserve officers association a private group 
since 1973 when the draft was abolished and the military 
restructured itself the armed forces have put increasing emphasis 
on the role of reserves but the gulf crisis is the first time the 
total force policy has been put to a test 
leggs group applauded the bush administration when it 
authorized the callup of as many as 48800 noncombat reserves to 
perform cargo handling air transport port security intelligence 
and various military supply jobs 
but the reserve officers association and others say that not 
using combat reserves is a fierce blow to the morale of these 
citizen soldiers who train with active units and are required by 
law to be ready to mobilize in times of crisis 
national guard units train one weekend per month plus one 
fourweek exercise each year 
weve heard a number of reasons for not sending guard and 
reserve combat units but theyre about as solid as sand said 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee i suspect the most important factor is the active 
force prejudice against using reserve forces 
aspin and reps beverly byron dmd and sonny montgomery 
dmiss released a report last week sharply criticizing the bush 
administration for not using combat reserve units in saudi arabia 
the suggestion intended or not that their work is neither 
fully appreciated or really needed in time of hostilities would 
have a disastrous influence on morale and performance the report 
said the failure to make greater use of reserve units in this 
crisis raises the broader question of when and even whether 
they would be used in the future 
pentagon officials cite two reasons for not sending combat 
reserves to saudi arabia one is that field commanders in saudi 
arabia have not said they need them the other is that the 180day 
maximum deployment period for reserves is too short to make good 
use of combat units since they would need extra training before 
shipping out 
critics say the reserves should not need extra training they 
cite the pentagons own study of the reserve forces published last 
spring stating that the reserve components have achieved 
unprecedented levels of capability and readiness 
the georgia army national guards diamond scoffed at the 
suggestion that the 48th would need extra time to get ready 
we believe the 48th brigade would require no more training 
than an active brigade would he said

if the agriculture department is truly 
interested in saving money it could consider eliminating some of 
the scores of studies that highsalaried economists and policy 
analysts spew forth each year 
but congress has called the tune until now leaving usda no 
choice but to study such things as gypsy moths brucellosis flower 
sales and composting 
this could change under the 1990 farm bill approved last week by 
conferees from the house and senate 
sen bob dole rkan was fed up with all the expensive studies 
the usda was ordered to perform and conferees approved his 
amendment to cut back on some of the load 
many of these studies are duplicative and unnecessary and 
very likely will never even be read or used to shape future policy 
decisions dole said this provision removes some of the 
nonsense which an election year has put into the farm bill 
dole said his plan could potentially save up to 100 million by 
limiting the studies lets save some money for a change and stop 
this silly study craze he said 
under his plan the usda would choose a minimum of 12 studies to 
be carried out as part of the fiveyear farm bill the selection 
would also have to gain the approval of senate and house 
agriculture committee chairmen 
according to doles office the massive farm bill calls for 168 
studies reports and surveys 
the significance of the dole amendment is that usda would be 
able to pick and choose those subjects for study with committee 
approval previously it was mandatory for usda to study whatever 
was specified 
many of the studies over the years have been selfserving 
instruments for farm commodity groups agricultural industries and 
individual members of congress studies are sometimes an easy way 
to impress the home folk and to delay or affect legislative action 
in short some of the usda studies can be pretty dear to the 
hearts of certain lawmakers 
for example when senate members of the farm bill conference 
committee tried to eliminate a study on roses and other flowers 
the house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas 
jumped to its defense 
the study on the effects of imported flowers on the domestic cut 
flower industry meant a lot to the house budget committee chairman 
leon panetta said de la garza 
flowergrowing is an important industry in panettas northern 
california district 
i dont want to make a big issue of this said sen richard 
lugar of indiana the ranking republican on the committee but 
our research shows that in 10 of the last 13 years there has been a 
cutflower study program by the government including the us 
international trade commission 
de la garza insisted another study was necessary the senate 
side of the conference table surrendered 
more than 200 studies were listed in the house and senate farm 
bills some duplication appeared to exist even within single 
portions 
in the senate bill for example the title on trade specified 
four separate studies or reports on export assistance update the 
trade assistance office export sales use of credit guarantees and 
direct loans and food aid assistance 
the bills portion about conservation sought a study of 
compost uses and processes for composting agricultural wastes it 
also asked for studies on outreach to socially disadvantaged 
farmers and consolidation of usda offices on indian 
reservations 
finally at the end of the conservation title the senate bill 
specified compilation of a catalog of laws rules and programs 
regarding composts 
in the research part of the bill a study was sought on farm 
accident prevention and also a tractor rollover study 
global warming was a biggie for senate farm bill writers with 
three usda studies outlined on 
agriculture and forestry implications of global change 
effects of global warming on rice production 
experimental studies on the effects of global warming on the 
production of major us crops 
the house version of the farm bill included a heavy 
concentration on food aid to foreign countries including one on 
world food day 
others included a report on wood and fish export promotion 
which was listed next to chairman de la garzas favored study on 
cut flowers followed by a commodity transportation and 
technology assessment report and a red tart cherry study

iraqi troops are continually repositioning 
themselves inside kuwait making it entirely possible that a 
large number of forces have regrouped in the north according to 
pentagon and private analysts 
lt col steve roy a pentagon spokesman said sunday he could 
not confirm a report from the persian gulf that iraqi forces have 
begun pulling back to the northern part of the country 
but he said the report was entirely possible because of 
constant iraqi troop movements in kuwait the oilrich country iraq 
invaded on aug 2 us officials estimate iraq has up to 400000 
troops in or around kuwait 
alkhaleej a newspaper in sharjah one of the united arab 
emirates reported sunday that hundreds of tanks and armored 
vehicles and armored personnel carriers have been sighted heading 
toward north kuwait specifically to the region of matla 
the paper gave no source for its report and independent 
verification could not be obtained because journalists have been 
unable to enter kuwait recently 
the iraqi forces were grouping around a fence in the occupied 
country the paper said last week kuwaiti refugees said iraqis 
were building a fence in the region of matla surrounding the 
islands of warba and bubiyan and the rumailah oil field iraqi 
president saddam hussein claimed these regions before aug 2 
marshall wiley a former ambassador to iraq now in private 
business said saddam might be inclined to increase protection of 
the oil field and the islands if he believed the united states was 
prepared to launch offensive action 
james akins a former ambassador to saudi arabia an now a 
private consultant said the bush administrations worst 
nightmare would be for saddam to withdraw from most of kuwait 
clinging only to the huge oil field and the islands saddam has 
long sought the islands because they give iraq access to the sea 
such a scenario would force the administration to justify 
keeping 200000 troops in saudi arabia even though saddam had left 
most of kuwait akins said 
the bush administration and the united nations have insisted 
that iraq withdraw unconditionally from kuwait and returning 
control of its government to the alsabah family now in exile 
there have been conflicting interpretations of what saddam 
intends to do in kuwait a country his troops have systematically 
looted over the past 2 months 
cia director william webster said in an interview with the 
associated press last week that everything suggests he is there 
for the long haul webster said saddams troops are dug in 
another intelligence analyst speaking on condition of 
anonymity said saddams fallback position might be to relinquish 
all of kuwait except the islands and the oil field 
last week a londonbased iraqi opposition group said iraq was 
considering withdrawing from kuwait the kurdistan democratic 
partyiraq said iraqs ruling political party had circulated a 
questionnaire asking key members for their opinion on the issue 
in other developments sunday 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine insisted that 
only congress has the right to declare war mitchell reiterated a 
position that has put congress at odds with top bush administration 
officials only congress can make that grave decision mitchell 
said on nbctvs meet the press program 
last week secretary of state james a baker iii refused to 
commit the administration to getting any advance congressional 
approval for any military action 
the middle east policy survey a newsletter published in 
washington reported that a few days before saddam invaded kuwait 
bush sent a message to the iraqi president the message relayed to 
the iraqi foreign minister expressed the administrations concern 
about iraqi troop movements but said the united states wanted 
improved usiraqi relations 
the washington post in sundays editions quoted sources as 
confirming that bush wrote a presidential message which was 
supposed to be relayed to saddam through april glaspie the us 
ambassador to iraq

josie heath was showered with national attention 
when she became the only woman in the country to launch a serious 
democratic bid for the us senate this year 
the former boulder county commissioner attracted support from 
womens groups with her prochoice abortion stance and she captured 
the democratic nomination in august after a tough primary election 
campaign against attorney carlos lucero 
then she ran up against republican rep hank brown 
brown who has been in congress 10 years holds a comfortable 
lead in the pols and is gaining ground his wellfinanced campaign 
emphasizes the congressmans independent streak 
for example brown has been a diehard opponent of new taxes and 
he has a more moderate record than the current holder of the seat 
gop sen bill armstrong on issues such as abortion and the 
environment 
brown never has been a republican party goosestepper says 
press aide katy atkinson hes voted against ronald reagan and 
hes voted against bush even though bush has been out here twice 
to raise money for him 
the fact that brown is an incumbent is not a drawback in 
colorado 
simply to be a part of the news flow that comes out of the 
nations capitol at this point is not a disadvantage said rick 
ridder a political consultant to democratic candidates weve 
not seen any antiincumbency movement in colorado unlike 
massachusetts 
brown is so popular right now i think people just arent going 
to change no matter what the television ads say says longtime 
lobbyist stan sours of denver 
during the primary campaign heath 53 proposed converting the 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant to a toxic waste research 
facility she also favored some form of national health care 
but in the race against brown she has spent much of her time 
attacking her opponent characterizing him as an advocate for 
polluters and a friend of savings and loan wheelerdealers 
lately she has toned down that approach but she has failed to 
establish who she is and what she stands for 
you cannot launch an attack on someone without establishing 
your own base its fundamental said longtime democratic 
consultant jim monaghan 
aside from her reputation as a hardworking boulder county 
commissioner she has no established political credentials 
its clear that voters do not yet know who josie is 
acknowledges heath coordinator bobby mccallum 
brown was leading heath 57 percent to 29 percent in the latest 
poll his lead went up 8 percentage points in two weeks he also is 
way ahead in campaign finances collecting more than 25 million 
in donations to heaths 125 million 
mccallum predicts a major shift in support when heaths campaign 
airs new television ads claiming that only 36 percent of browns 
support is solid and heaths camp has enough money to make a 
decent buy on the airwaves he says 
some feel heath may have turned some democrats off during her 
vitriolic clashes with lucero before the august primary 
in colorado if they the voters dont know you they dont 
really like to see you come out blasting someone they do know 
said one political advisor who asked not to be identified because 
she is working for a republican candidate 
heaths views on defense also dont play well with many of 
colorados conservative democrats 
early in the primary campaign she proposed cutting the defense 
budget by half over 10 years that backfired after the primary when 
political cartoonists juxtaposed her stand on defense with 
depictions of saddam husseins invasion of kuwait 
in addition heath is emphasizing her opposition to the line 
item veto and a proposed balanced budget amendment when more and 
more of the states democrats are embracing those ideas

more than 200 went on hunger strike six 
were hospitalized but in the end the students who created a 
bloodless version of tiananmen square in the ukraine were sad to go 
home 
for 16 days this month the proindependence hunger strikers 
lived in a tent city on the main square of kiev the ukrainian 
capital deliberately duplicating the tactics of prodemocracy 
chinese students in beijing in 1989 
the ukrainian students gambled that soviet authorities would not 
dare to follow chinas example and send the army to crush them 
they turned out to be right 
we went in with cold minds prepared for any kind of conflict 
but with the conviction that the only real path open to the 
government was peaceful said vladimir boyarsky a 22yearold 
medical student 
on wednesday the ukrainian government capitulated to most of 
the students demands for faster steps toward independence 
including the resignation of the republics prime minister 
on thursday they took down the tents they had staked between 
cracks in the marble slabs of revolution square 
and over the weekend they headed back to their homes across 
this fertile republic of 51 million people the breadbasket of the 
soviet union 
after the government announced it was giving in we went wild 
with joy boyarsky said friday 
then we all realized that this piece of our lives was ending 
we would be heading off in different directions and hardly anyone 
slept that night with all the sentimental goodbyes 
that sentiment was far removed from the tension the students 
felt on the first day of the hunger strike oct 2 when seven 
busloads of riot police pulled up to the square 
the strike had been planned for weeks in extreme detail by the 
ukrainian student union in kiev and the student brotherhood in 
lvov a city of 770000 in the western ukraine 
both groups were angry over the lack of progress toward 
independence by the republics parliament since it declared 
sovereignty july 16 they demanded bolder moves such as those 
taken by the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia 
every nation has a right to selfdetermination on its own 
territory law student igor osobik 22 said friday 
you know more than 40 million ukrainians have been killed in 
the period of soviet power from famine and from bullets why cant 
we be masters of our own fate our own future our own land 
on oct 2 a day after the ukrainian parliament opened its 
session 120 hunger strikers and 50 supporters set up the first 22 
tents on revolution square under a towering bronze statue of 
lenin 
supporters wore armbands to mark their preassigned roles red 
for medics black for guards keeping order in the camp blue for 
people serving tea and cleaning up 
they had a permit for a demonstration but not for the tents 
while fearing a police raid at any minute they concentrated on 
explaining their position to passersby 
the students accused the parliamentary majority a bloc of 239 
communist party members of toadying to moscow 
they argued that the communists and the republics prime 
minister vitaly masol were trying to thwart real independence by 
moving toward a new union treaty with other soviet republics at the 
urging of president mikhail s gorbachev 
they vowed to remain on the square until the parliament agreed 
to six demands masols resignation rejection of any new union 
treaty permission for all ukrainians in the soviet army to serve 
on ukrainian soil nationalization of communist party property in 
the ukraine dissolution of parliament and new elections 
the first day there was a very heavy feeling because we 
didnt know what the police were going to do said boyarsky 
but all they did was surround us and the next day we began what 
you might call normal life 
history student lyudmila demirskaya 25 said most of the 
students spent their days singing folk songs and meeting new 
arrivals who came at the rate of more than 50 a day from schools 
across the republic swelling the camp to more than 800 people 
a total of 217 students registered as hunger strikers for 
varying lengths of time about 20 reportedly went without food for 
a full two weeks 
christopher kedzie a harvard university researcher working on 
economic reform in the ukraine said he walked by the tent city 
every day and was amazed at two things the discipline of the 
students and the outpouring of support from kiev residents who 
brought mattresses blankets money and flowers 
thousands of people marched through the city last monday 
tuesday and wednesdaty to support the students demands students 
claim the largest march on the 17th involved more than 100000 
people authorities say it was only 20000 
whatever the figure public support for the students was strong 
enough that parliament realized we had to take them seriously 
and the only rational course was compromise said alexander 
kotzuba a centrist lawmaker 
on wednesday evening masol agreed to resign and parliament 
passed a resolution promising to put off signing a new union treaty 
and saying all ukrainian soldiers should be allowed to serve inside 
the republic 
it also set up a commission to work on nationalizing communist 
party property and called for a referendum to decide whether to 
dissolve parliament and hold new elections 
last week we felt the strength of our youth sergei sukhov 
a 62yearold printer said on a kiev streetcorner not all of us 
were at the demonstrations but we supported they won and they 
are now the pride of our nation

retiring from congress this year must feel 
like stepping off a runaway train relief mixed with concern and 
no regrets 
one of my burdens is being teased by my colleagues for having 
such incredible timing laughs rep bob whittaker rkan im 
glad im going to do it now 
the budget mess government shutdown ethics scandals and the 
pay raise have made this latest congress even more hateable than 
usual but if the historical pattern holds and it may not there 
will be few house incumbents sent packing by the voters on nov 6 
there are a handful packing their own bags for home eleven out 
of 434 house members are retiring not defeated just leaving 
conversations with most of them reveal some bitterness a 
longing for happier times and a wish they were retiring from a 
congress with higher public esteem 
it takes you out with a bad taste in your mouth the way the 
101st congress has performed said rep bill frenzel rminn who 
labored mightily to find a bipartisan budget only to have the house 
shoot it down its no fun to be part of a group that cant get 
its work done 
rep jim courter rnj ran for governor last year he could 
have kept his house seat but decided against seeking another term 
he feels hes been proven right 
people who questioned the rightness and correctness of my 
decision are now coming up and saying i dont blame you he 
said 
courter a member of the house armed services committee said 
things had changed for the worse over the 12 years hes spent in 
the house he related how he was barred from recent housesenate 
talks on the defense budget and then was threatened if he didnt 
sign the agreement 
they told me youve put some language in there the bill 
its going to come out unless you sign it he said he didnt 
sign 
its a heck of a way to go out he sighed looking forward 
to what he said would be a more simple life 
rep lindy boggs dla saw her husband hale give his life to 
the house she now is retiring from the seat he once held 
the current gloom gives me particular pain because i spent so 
many years in the institution but she takes solace in the work 
she did on marking congress bicentennial 
when this temporary difficulty is passed that will be there 
to sustain the institution the peoples body she said 
whittaker wholl be teaching political science at the 
university of kansas said he wasnt worried about congress he 
said there have been other periods when the legislative branch was 
held in low regard 
from a historical perspective its something that goes 
around he said 
rep marvin leath dtexas says he hopes people will see 
something positive in his retirement from an influential 
congressional career at age 59 
people say nobody walks away from that job well somebody 
did and maybe that gives a little bit of faith to people who think 
the system is so totally corrupt and bad it really isnt leath 
said 
rep virginia smith rneb though saddened by the current 
uproar remains sentimental about the place 
its been 16 great years she said recalling how she had 
to win over nine handsome young men just to come to congress at a 
time when women were still considered unusual in politics 
im going to miss these folks she said but we want to 
leave while were still young enough to look forward to going 
home 
rep augustus f hawkins dcalif is a powerful committee 
chairman who looks forward to returning to private life after 28 
years and complaining about congress 
its good im glad to see it he said of the national 
discontent and ill be one of those outsiders attacking

kevin hermening is still searching for the 
right start to his political career a decade after his release as 
an iranian hostage he is fighting his past as much as his 
political rival 
the former hostage label is a political noose to him 
it is the single major liability to my running for office 
said hermening the 31yearold republican is running for the 
wisconsin assembly after two failed bids for congress 
the people of the community are sick and tired of it 
hermening said of his hostage past the biggest difficulty is 
most people think the only thing i have done has been in iran 
hermening a former marine guard was the youngest of the 52 
people held hostage for 444 days at the us embassy in iran in 
1979 
since returning to wisconsin he has worked for a political 
consulting firm and run twice unsuccessfully for congress losing 
in 1986 and 1988 to democratic rep david obey 
hermening scaled back his political ambitions in june 
announcing he would challenge state rep brad zweck a twoterm 
democrat he is running in a northcentral wisconsin district that 
has elected five different legislators in the past 12 years 
running for the legislature is a relief actually not a 
letdown hermening said 
running for congress in the 80s and 90s is like trying to 
scale a mountain with none of the gear hermening said unless 
you are a selfmade millionaire you simply dont have a chance 
a year ago on the 10year anniversary of the seizure of the 
embassy in iran hermening said the experience drove everything he 
did 
today he tries to distance himself politics dictates such a 
strategy he says 
hermening has received letters from people praising him for his 
courage but letters accusing him of cowardice come too kevin 
hermening and other marines surrendered the fort they gave up the 
ship one letter said 
hermening has sent out about 75 campaign news releases over the 
past five years none of which mentioned iran or the hostages 
hes asked newspapers editors not to refer to him as a former 
iranian hostage at least not in the first three words of their 
stories 
my campaign brochure doesnt have a picture of me with a 
marine uniform hermening said 
zweck says hermenings celebrity status is a twoedged 
sword 
people have a very strong first impression of him one way or 
the other the incumbent said 
but zweck isnt so sure voters question hermening only about his 
role in the iranian hostage crisis some wonder if he is a 
carpetbagger who moved from his native milwaukee to northern 
wisconsin only to run for congress zweck said 
they resent he abused that status and moved into a strange 
area and immediately ran for office zweck said 
hermenings wellpublicized involvement in protests against 
indian hunting and fishing rights in northern wisconsin also 
irritates some voters zweck added 
those are types of activities that make you a great person in 
the eyes of some but a very negative figure in the eyes of 
others the lawmaker said 
hermening a selfdescribed conservative said hes always been 
interested in public service hes owned a home in the district for 
3 years 
tell me what brad zweck ever did to better qualify him for 
running for office compared to what i did he asks 
while hermening shuns the former hostage label in public he 
maintains personal pride in the ordeal he survived and he feels a 
special concern for those now held hostage in iraq 
i have got my medals displayed prominently i have a flag 
outside my house youre damn right i am proud of it hermening 
said i have a big yellow ribbon outside my house millions of 
people put them up for me the least i can do is put one up for 
them

stung by public criticism the house is moving 
to force its members to tell the public how much postagefree mail 
they send and rein in those lawmakers who abuse the privilege 
new limits on how much mail house members can send out free were 
made part of a 22 billion bill that provides money to operate 
congress in the 1991 fiscal year that began oct 1 the bill was 
approved 292117 sunday and sent to the senate 
the bipartisan compromise limit on congress franking privilege 
adopted on a voice vote was a sign that lawmakers are nervous 
about their low standing in the public eye 
with that in mind and with elections just 16 days away the 
house also voted 76 million in spending cuts before giving final 
approval to the appropriations bill included in the cuts was a 
proposed 50000permember increase in staff salary accounts 
members were so sensitive about spending money on themselves 
that they hours sunday sparring over whether to spend 500000 on 
modular furniture and 350000 to renovate the house beauty shop 
the furniture was nixed but the beauty shop renovation was 
preserved after female house members argued that its old wiring 
represents a safety hazard 
despite appearances the ceilings on free mail were set high 
enough to avoid affecting most lawmakers and some of the other 
cuts are expected to be restored in negotiations with the senate 
this week or in a supplemental money bill next year staff sources 
said 
left unscathed was a whopping increase in house members 
salaries from their current 96600 to 125100 effective jan 1 
under the new mail limits each house member would be given an 
allowance sufficient to send three firstclass mailings to each 
residential address in the district an average of 178000 
members could boost that another 25000 by transferring money 
from their office accounts and each would have to report quarterly 
on how much had been spent total mailing costs would be limited to 
59 million in the year that began oct 1 
the move was designed to prevent abuses by a few members who 
spend upwards of 400000 a year on mail including the ubiquitous 
newsletters designed primarily to get a lawmakers name and picture 
into thousands of homes 
it is those mailings that reformers point to as a primary 
benefit that enabled 98 percent of the incumbent house members to 
hold on to their job last election 
mass mailings were used as a public relations menu for some 
members of the house said rep jerry lewis rcalif who argued 
in favor of the change along with rep vic fazio dcalif 
the senate already restricts and reveals the mail costs of its 
members but house leaders until recently resisted the idea 
two congressional watchdog groups common cause and the national 
taxpayers union had endorsed the restrictions on the franking 
privilege

on the olympic peninsula where logging is 
revered and spotted owls are hung in effigy jeff debonis preaches 
a message that many folks dont want to hear the forest service 
has been raping the land for decades to feed a profithungry 
timber industry 
its a message that the founder of the association of forest 
service employees for environmental ethics repeats often to 
generally polite audiences 
however he acknowledges he has his work cut out for him in a 
region where the conservation vs jobs debate tends to be stated in 
stark terms 
there is a real cultural bias that has been perpetuated the 
treehugging environmental hippy on food stamps versus the 
goodolboy red neck pickuptruckdriving logger debonis said 
recently before making an appearance at the highway 101 diner 
if they consider me to be the enemy then thats fine the 
forest service has been considering the public the enemy for 
years he said in an interview 
debonis of eugene ore resigned his job in february after 12 
years as a timber sales manager with the forest service he said 
most of the 1500 forest service workers who have joined his group 
are foresters who went to college in the 1960s and 1970s and got 
a dose of ecology and social conscience 
they have seen the destruction but they are not in a position 
of power yet to do anything about it he said 
afseee advocates dramatic reductions in timber harvests to help 
protect the northwests dwindling supply of oldgrowth forests the 
group contends that the forest service has been overcutting trees 
in violation of the 1976 national forest management act 
debonis said those practices have resulted in the northern 
spotted owl becoming a threatened species and the red cockaded 
woodpecker becoming endangered 
debonis fear of a hostile audience in sequim proved to be 
largely unfounded but one critic in the crowd of 75 did shout 
youre wrong and a local forest service employee charged that 
debonis organization was a front for preservationists a 
special interest the same as the timber industry 
it seems to me that youre saying if i am not a member then i 
am not for the environment said harvey olson a forest service 
timber sale administrator 
there are a lot of people in the forest service with guts and 
real concerns you dont have a license on that olson said 
since he launched afseee nearly two years ago debonis said its 
membership has grown to include about 5 percent of the agencys 
workforce nationwide 
more importantly he said an increasing number of those 
disgruntled workers are going public with their complaints 
there are lots of people who are still afraid to join afseee 
its a very valid fear because the forest service is decentralized 
and there are lots of oldschool managers out there it is very 
easy for them to make peoples lives miserable debonis said 
but the lower echelon people are starting to say enough is 
enough i know of a lot of people in the past who would just quit 
in disgust he said 
debonis appearance was sponsored by the quilcene ancient forest 
coalition 
bob crowley head of the coalition and the olympic environmental 
council said interest in afseee became visible on the peninsula 
among 30 to 35 forest service workers about a year ago but it was 
pretty clandestine 
john calhoun olympic regional manager for the state department 
of natural resources in forks said the debate over timber 
management practices has sharply divided the forest service 
the forest service internally is just in a shambles right now 
there is a lot of difficultly with morale calhoun said 
debonis said he is sympathetic to concerns of lost jobs as a 
result of reductions in logging but he said at the current rate of 
cutting the jobs will be lost in 10 years anyway regardless of 
the spotted owl or other environmental issues

prime minister mahathir mohamads 
governing coalition retained power in weekend elections winning 
more than the twothirds parliamentary majority it had sought 
election officials said today 
the national front coalition won 127 seats in the lower house to 
49 for the combined opposition four seats went to independents 
elections commission officials said the final results were 
delayed until this afternoon because heavy rains prevented some 
ballot boxes from remote aborigine settlements from being airlifted 
when the polls closed sunday 
after singing a victory song and cutting a cake a jubilant 
mahathir said we are happy that the people have returned us to 
power with a more than twothirds majority this will enable us to 
give a strong peaceful and stable government 
it was his third election victory since becoming prime minister 
in 1981 he claims credit for one of the fastest growing economies 
in southeast asia 
but the governing coalition suffered to upsets defense minister 
ahmed rithaudden was defeated in the kelantan state district of 
kota baharu and stephen young minister for science technology 
and environment lost in sarawak 
anything less than a twothirds majority in parliament would 
have been regarded as a setback for mahathir such a margin is 
needed to amend the constitution and it also is a gauge of the 
prime ministers power 
in the old parliament the coalition held 133 of the 177 seats 
the new one was enlarged by three seats 
opposition leader tengku razaleigh hamzah won reelection to his 
parliament seat 
he issued a statement congratulating the governing coalition on 
its victory but he added i wish to remind that this victory 
has been achieved through abuse of power money the mass media 
government machinery and every deceit possible 
he did not elaborate 
the campaign was largely bereft of issues focusing instead on 
personalities 
the opposition charged the national front with economic 
mismanagement and cronyism and said it was indifferent to ethnic 
tensions and eroding judicial powers 
mahathir dismissed the accusations as groundless and derided the 
oppositions promise of tax cuts as the height of 
irresponsibility 
voter turnout ranged from 60 percent to 70 percent across the 
nation the nations 79 million voters are not required by law to 
cast ballots 
polling began saturday in remote areas of sabah and sarawak 
states and in the rest of the country sunday 
mahathir narrowly defeated razaleigh in a 1987 contest for the 
leadership of the united malays national organization the key 
party in the governing coalition 
malaysia has been ruled by a multiracial coalition led by the 
united malays ever since independence in 1957 
political parties are essentially based on race the national 
front coalition also includes the malaysian chinese association 
malaysian indian congress and seven smaller parties 
malays comprise about 53 percent of the population of 178 
million chinese make up about 32 percent with indians and other 
races making up the balance 
in seven earlier national elections a fragmented opposition 
made little headway against the national front establishing only 
regional power bases 
but this time the electorate had an organized alternative 
representing the same ethnic mosaic as the national front

congressional negotiators reached a tentative 
agreement today on a wideranging clean air bill that will require 
factories automakers and utilities to cut pollution dramatically 
over the next decade 
the legislation which toughens federal air pollution laws for 
the first time in 13 years was expected to be formally approved by 
a housesenate conference possibly later today and then go back 
to the two chambers for endorsement 
congress began considering the clean air measure more than a 
year ago 
the compromise bill retains a fiveyear 250 million aid 
program for workers who lose their jobs because of tougher 
pollution controls the white house had objected to financial 
assistance and had threatened to veto the bill if it were included 
but the administration appeared to soften its opposition to the 
provision after language was included to keep the program from 
becoming too costly 
white house aides when departing from the talks did not repeat 
their veto threat and congressional sources said they doubt 
president bush would scuttle the longsought clean air legislation 
on that jobloss assistance issue 
agreement on the last sections of the massive bill which covers 
nearly 700 pages came as house and senate negotiators worked 
through most of night sunday and much of the early morning today 
congressional leaders had wanted a bill by the end of the weekend 
to give it enough time to clear congress before adjournment friday 
the bills controls aimed at cutting urban smog and ridding the 
air of millions of pounds of toxic chemicals are expected to touch 
on almost every sector of industry and cost the economy between 22 
billion and 25 billion when all its provisions go into effect 
negotiators reached agreement early sunday on steep pollution 
cuts from electric power plants to reduce acid rain coalburning 
power plants in 21 states will be directed to cut their sulfur 
dioxide releases almost in half reducing annual emissions by about 
10 million tons by the year 2001 
the acid rain provision which will hit utilities and consumers 
of electricity in the industrial midwest the hardest was the last 
major section of the bill to be resolved agreements had been 
reached previously that cut smogcausing emissions from automobiles 
and toxic chemical releases from factories and businesses 
were getting real protection it meets the acid test on acid 
rain said rep gerry sikorski dminn a leading proponent of 
acid rain curbs 
the housesenate conferees struggled since midjuly to resolve 
differences in separate bills approved earlier by the house and 
senate 
for weeks there was only modest progress but the pace quickened 
in recent weeks with tentative agreements on key sections of the 
massive and technically complex legislation among the major 
provisions 
utilities must reduce their annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 
10 million tons or nearly in half by installing scrubbers or 
switching to lowsulfur coal they also must cut nitrogen oxides 
which also contribute to acid rain 
about 100 cities now considered to have unhealthy air must 
meet federal air quality standards within five to 15 years 
depending on the severity of the problem by reduce smogcausing 
emissions los angeles is given 20 years 
industry must install new pollution control equipment to cut 
the release of toxic chemicals into the air by 90 percent over the 
next decade only the steel industrys coke ovens would be given 
more time until 2020 even stronger pollution control measures 
could be required if the environmental protection agency concludes 
that residents near a plant are not ensured an amble margin of 
safety from the risk of cancer 
pollution from automobiles must be cut 30 to 60 percent 
through additional controls on tailpipe emissions and the phasein 
of alternative fuel vehicles in fleets a california pilot program 
also would require 300000 personal cars powered by alternative 
fuels by 1999 it could be copied by other states 
oil companies must provide cleaner gasoline blends in cities 
with the worst smog problems the requirement is aimed at pushing 
the sale of reformulated gasoline or blends that include 
additives such as ethanol 
the measures affecting factories thousands of small businesses 
automobiles and electric rates are acknowledged to be expensive 
but environmentalists argue much of the cost will be offset by 
savings in health care because of the cleaner air 
the controls on acid rain are expected to hit hardest in the 
industrial midwest where electric utilities have the dirtiest 
plants because of their heavy reliance on highsulfur coal 
in final bargaining midwest lawmakers gained some additional 
credits that will ease the cost of installing new pollution 
devices especially over the first five years negotiators 
however rejected efforts by the utility industry to roll back the 
sulfur dioxide reductions substantially according to congressional 
sources 
early today the house and senate negotiators also agreed to 
impose for the first time air pollution restrictions on offshore 
oil rigs an issue pressed by california lawmakers rigs off the 
gulf of mexico however are exempt 
meanwhile a requirement to regulate visibility in federal parks 
was taken out of the bill several western senators had threatened 
to block the legislation on the senate floor if it contained the 
visibility provision the compromise calls for park visibility to 
be studied

taiwan protests japans move against taiwan ships 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
premier hau peitsun today protested 
japans move to block two taiwanese ships from reaching a disputed 
island chain and warned of effective measures if japan harasses 
taiwanese ships in the area 
we launch the severest protest against japans unfriendly 
harassment of our fishing boats hau said after an emergency 
cabinet meeting 
he also urged japan to tear down a lighthouse built on one of 
the eight unpopulated islands that make up the chain in the east 
china sea 
they are known as the senkaku islands to the japanese and the 
diaoyutai islands to taiwan and china 
japanese coast guard patrol boats turned back two taiwanese 
fishing vessels approaching the islets on sunday the taiwanese 
boats sought to land a delegation of politicians and athletes to 
plant national flags on one of the islets uotsuri to reinforce a 
claim to the territory by taiwans nationalist chinese government 
in tokyo a japanese foreign ministry official said the islands 
are our countrys native territory and it is regrettable that 
such an action was conducted by the taiwan boats 
our government handled the matter according to related laws 
said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
in taipei about 30 taiwanese pelted japans unofficial embassy 
with eggs and demonstrators said they opposed what they called the 
revival of japans militarism 
in the southern city of kaohsiung protesters burned a japanese 
flag 
like most countries japan does not recognize taiwan it 
maintains close trade ties with the island nation but has 
diplomatic relations with taiwans longtime enemy communist china 
uotsuri about 2 miles long and one mile wide is the largest 
of the disputed islands five of the eight islets are no more than 
rocks 
the area however is regarded as a rich fishing ground and 
also is believed to contain oil deposits taiwanese fishermen have 
been known to shelter in the islets during storms 
the islets are 270 miles southwest of naha capital of the 
japanese island prefecture of okinawa and 95 miles northwest of 
the nearest neighboring japanese island iriomotejima they are 118 
miles northesat of taiwan 
premier hau said the government supported sundays patriotic 
efforts 
japanese authorities must not deter our boats from fishing 
near diaoyutai waters or we will take effective measures to 
protect such fishing activities when necessary hau said he did 
not elaborate 
the islands were claimed by japan in 1895 
but the nationalists who claim to be the legitimate rulers of 
all of china say the islets came under chinese sovereignty in 1945 
when japan was defeated in world war ii in 1949 the nationalists 
lost a civil war to the chinese communists and fled mainland china 
to taiwan 
the united states took over administration of the islets after 
the war and returned them to japan along with okinawa in 1972 
the communist government in china laid claim to the islands in 
1971 and reiterated the claim last week 
the latest dispute followed reports that a japanese rightwing 
political group had received permission from the japanese 
government to renovate a lighthouse on one of the islands 
the issue has touched a raw nerve among taiwanese who suffered 
much during japans occupation of the island from 1895 to 1945

the robber captivated the israeli public by 
holding up 22 banks and making off on a motorcycle but the suspect 
in custody apparently is anything but a latterday robin hood 
police on sunday identified the suspect as an heir to millions 
who allegedly turned to crime to pay his debts 
dozens of israeli press and broadcast reports had chronicled his 
exploits and his helmeted image adorned tshirts and decal 
stickers in news reports he was nicknamed bikerbank 
but the man identified by police as roni leibovitz tried to 
fight that image in an interview with army radio today he said he 
was not a hero and had made a terrible mistake the radio said 
in the interview 
all of this attention i am getting i am not a hero not a 
folk hero or a hero of any other type leibovitz was quoted as 
saying they are creating me as they want i made a terrible 
mistake 
he was quoted as saying the robberies were a result of 
pressure on me of certain family circumstances certain 
environmental circumstances 
many israelis were shocked to learn that leibovitz arrested 
thursday was the suspect 
the 37yearold mans family runs a large israeli food products 
company and several businesses in new york 
leibovitz in custody in tel aviv has acknowledged taking 
175000 from banks but had no charitable goal for the loot police 
said 
when asked what his motive was he said money he said he 
did not want to take revenge against police or the banks he did 
not want to be a national hero but needed the money because of his 
debts tel aviv police spokeswoman dalia gilad said sunday 
the deputy police superintendent who headed the investigation 
chaim pinchas said leibovitz was as meticulous in his planning 
as an army operations officer but not so in his financial 
affairs he owed more than 1 million pinchas said 
the bandit would walk into a bank wearing a crash helmet and 
fire one shot in the air from a 38caliber pistol he always 
robbed the teller nearest the door then disappeared on a 
highpowered motorcycle no one was ever hurt 
leibovitz had unsuccessfully tried to run family ventures in 
israel according to the israeli media 
newspapers described his privileged life and a large villa he 
started to build in herzliya pituach a wealthy seaside area near 
tel aviv 
leibovitz was arrested at his parents israeli home after he 
attempted to rob a bank in suburban tel aviv police said they 
found the motorcycle and pistol allegedly used in the robberies in 
the garden 
police say he had had an initial hearing and will be charged 
soon he has so far accompanied police to about half of his robbery 
sites to show them how it was done 
but even with the arrest the myth did not die completely 
as leibovitz was taken to a haifa bank on friday to recreate one 
robbery hundreds of israelis gathered outside and applauded

area on the bridge before taking the plunge with two groomsmen and 
three wedding guests 
but the crowd wouldnt let him king taylor and their guests 
couldnt move past the center of the bridge reserved for jumping 
they married instead on a wooden portable staircase while 
screaming people pushed each other for a closer view 
some guests missed the wedding entirely because they were 
waiting elsewhere on the bridge 
they ended up getting married in the wrong spot said 
groomsman mark worthen 
worthen had problems of his own after jumping he landed on 
railroad tracks instead of the riverbank and was promptly cited for 
trespassing by railroad police

president elias hrawis government is 
moving to accelerate the process of unifying beirut disbanding 
rival militias and freeing western hostages aides said today 
they said plans were made during two days of talks in damascus 
between hrawi and syrian president hafez assad who renewed a 
pledge to support efforts to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
hrawi returned to beirut on sunday night hours after gunmen 
killed christian leader dany chamoun 56 his wife and two young 
sons at their home in suburban baabda 
today the christian area staged a daylong shutdown to protest 
the slayings which came a week after hrawis army and syrian 
troops crushed the mutiny of christian gen michel aoun the 
general took refuge in the french embassy 
chamoun the younger son of the late president camille chamoun 
supported aoun aouns headquarters had been in baabda 
prosyrian groups blamed the killings on christian warlord samir 
geagea whose lebanese forces militia fought an unsuccessful 
fourmonth war with aouns troops for mastery of the christian 
heartland northeast of beirut early this year 
geagea denied involvement in chamouns killing he joined other 
christian and moslem leaders in urging hrawis government to bring 
peace to the area that had been controlled by aouns forces 
hrawi told syrian state television his government was resolved 
to end the militia control of beirut 
all militias will be disbanded by peaceful means but we will 
use other means if we face objections hrawi said i warn 
everybody that no opposition by the gun or the cannon will be 
tolerated 
prime minister salim hoss headed for damascus today for talks 
with syrian leaders on ways to end the 15year division of 
christian east beirut and moslem west beirut 
a hrawi aide said that within two weeks the government wants 
geageas men to give the lebanese army control of the three east 
beirut districts they hold 
if the lebanese forces agree to a peaceful handover then 
there will be no need for syrian troops to enter east beirut like 
they did with aouns zone the ball is in geageas court the 
aide said 
he said the army also hopes to peacefully assume control of 
beiruts shiite moslem southern slums from hezbollah the umbrella 
for proiranian factions holding most of the 13 western hostages in 
lebanon 
hrawis aide said the syrian government plans to discuss the 
slums fate with foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran this 
week 
this the talks will definitely include the fate of the 
western hostages whether they still are held in the slums or 
smuggled out to the bekaa valley the aide said 
there is a syrianlebanese understanding that the hostage 
issue should be resolved correspondingly with the creation of 
greater beirut irrespective of where the hostages are being held 
wherever they are the syrians control the access he said 
two lebanese army intelligence officers told the associated 
press last week that six american and two british hostages were 
spirited from south beirut to east lebanons bekaa valley before 
the attack on aouns enclave oct 13 
syria maintains 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league mandate they control more than 70 percent of lebanons 
territory including the bekaa valley

a former member of romanias revolutionary 
government has bitterly criticized the suspension of the trial of 
the late dictator nicolae ceausescus secret police chief 
in a weekend telephone interview with the associated press 
silviu brucan said the decision by a military court in bucharest to 
suspend the trial of gen iulian vlad was an international 
scandal 
the military court trying vlad on charges of complicity to 
genocide acted friday citing insufficient evidence against the 
former head of securitate the ceausescu regimes secret police 
brucan a writer and former ambassador to the united states had 
been under house arrest when ceausescu fell last december and 
became the second ranking official in the national council of 
salvation which took over the government 
he later quit the council to protest its inclusion of high 
officials from the ceausescu regime 
vlad controlled the most monstrous repression machine in 
eastern europe brucan said adding it was wrong only to have 
tried him only on the limited charges of complicity in genocide 
from december 17 to december 23 of last year 
the charge stemmed from the alleged killing of more than 1000 
romanians by securitate troops during the revolution that toppled 
ceausescu vlad faced a maximum sentance of life in prison if 
convicted 
brucan said the story had been framed to avoid an examination 
of securitate itself and its criminal activity during the 
ceausescu regime 
brucan is in the united states on a lecture tour that includes 
visits to dartmouth college in new hampshire and tulane university 
in lousianna 
one of the earliest members of the romanian communist party 
brucan was frequently harassed and imprisoned by the securitate 
after he broke with the ceausescu government

congressional negotiators reached a tentative 
agreement today on a wideranging clean air bill that will require 
factories automakers and utilities to cut pollution dramatically 
over the next decade 
the legislation which toughens federal air pollution laws for 
the first time in 13 years was expected to be formally approved by 
a housesenate conference possibly later today and then go back 
to the two chambers for endorsement 
the bills controls aimed at cutting urban smog and ridding the 
air of millions of pounds of toxic chemicals are expected to touch 
on almost every sector of industry and cost the economy between 22 
billion and 25 billion when all its provisions go into effect 
under the legislation pollution from automobiles would be cut 
30 percent to 60 percent oil companies would be required to 
provide cleaner gasoline industries would reduce the amount of 
toxic chemicals released into the air and about 100 cities would be 
ordered to meet federal air quality standards 
the compromise bill retains a fiveyear 250 million aid 
program for workers who lose their jobs because of tougher 
pollution controls the white house had objected to financial 
assistance and had threatened to veto the bill if it were included 
but the administration appeared to soften its opposition to the 
provision after language was included to keep the program from 
becoming too costly 
white house aides when departing from the talks did not repeat 
their veto threat and congressional sources said they doubt 
president bush would scuttle the longsought clean air legislation 
on that jobloss assistance issue 
congress began considering the clean air measure more than a 
year ago 
agreement on the last sections of the massive bill which covers 
nearly 700 pages came as house and senate negotiators worked 
through most of night sunday and much of the early morning today 
congressional leaders had wanted a bill by the end of the weekend 
to give it enough time to clear congress before adjournment friday 
negotiators reached agreement early sunday on steep pollution 
cuts from electric power plants to reduce acid rain coalburning 
power plants in 21 states will be directed to cut their sulfur 
dioxide releases almost in half reducing annual emissions by about 
10 million tons by the year 2001 
the acid rain provision which will hit utilities and consumers 
of electricity in the industrial midwest the hardest was the last 
major section of the bill to be resolved agreements had been 
reached previously that cut smogcausing emissions from automobiles 
and toxic chemical releases from factories and businesses 
were getting real protection it meets the acid test on acid 
rain said rep gerry sikorski dminn a leading proponent of 
acid rain curbs 
the housesenate conferees struggled since midjuly to resolve 
differences in separate bills approved earlier by the house and 
senate 
for weeks there was only modest progress but the pace quickened 
in recent weeks with tentative agreements on key sections of the 
massive and technically complex legislation among the major 
provisions 
utilities must reduce their annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 
10 million tons or nearly in half by installing scrubbers or 
switching to lowsulfur coal they also must cut nitrogen oxides 
which also contribute to acid rain 
about 100 cities now considered to have unhealthy air must 
meet federal air quality standards within five to 15 years 
depending on the severity of the problem by reduce smogcausing 
emissions los angeles is given 20 years 
industry must install new pollution control equipment to cut 
the release of toxic chemicals into the air by 90 percent over the 
next decade only the steel industrys coke ovens would be given 
more time until 2020 even stronger pollution control measures 
could be required if the environmental protection agency concludes 
that residents near a plant are not ensured an amble margin of 
safety from the risk of cancer 
pollution from automobiles must be cut 30 to 60 percent 
through additional controls on tailpipe emissions and the phasein 
of alternative fuel vehicles in fleets a california pilot program 
also would require 300000 personal cars powered by alternative 
fuels by 1999 it could be copied by other states 
oil companies must provide cleaner gasoline blends in cities 
with the worst smog problems the requirement is aimed at pushing 
the sale of reformulated gasoline or blends that include 
additives such as ethanol 
the measures affecting factories thousands of small businesses 
automobiles and electric rates are acknowledged to be expensive 
but environmentalists argue much of the cost will be offset by 
savings in health care because of the cleaner air 
the controls on acid rain are expected to hit hardest in the 
industrial midwest where electric utilities have the dirtiest 
plants because of their heavy reliance on highsulfur coal 
in final bargaining midwest lawmakers gained some additional 
credits that will ease the cost of installing new pollution 
devices especially over the first five years negotiators 
however rejected efforts by the utility industry to roll back the 
sulfur dioxide reductions substantially according to congressional 
sources 
early today the house and senate negotiators also agreed to 
impose for the first time air pollution restrictions on offshore 
oil rigs an issue pressed by california lawmakers rigs off the 
gulf of mexico however are exempt 
meanwhile a requirement to regulate visibility in federal parks 
was taken out of the bill several western senators had threatened 
to block the legislation on the senate floor if it contained the 
visibility provision the compromise calls for park visibility to 
be studied

ambassador david tothill of south 
africa today criticized black leader nelson mandela for playing on 
the heartstrings of the western democracies to raise money 
hours before mandela was to reach canberra the federal capital 
to begin a fourday visit to australia tothill addressed a foreign 
correspondents association luncheon he told the reporters mandela 
is not the clearcut leader of all blacks in south africa 
many australians seem to believe that the negotiations for a 
new south african constitution are a subterfuge that will bring 
about a handover of power to the anc whereupon mr mandela will 
become the countrys first black president said tothill 
however the anc itself recognizes that it is not the only 
spokesman for black opinion their level of support cannot be 
quantified until an election is held 
tothill said mandela was a persona of the creation of the 
international media 
the south african ambassador said he could not estimate what 
mandelas trip to australia would raise for the anc mandelas 
itinerary includes a rally outside sydneys opera house on 
wednesday and a fundraising dinner at a hotel 
i have heard that his mandelas tour of the united states 
raised 10 million but i would not like to guess what he might 
achieve in australia tothill said 
earlier this year the south african government freed mandela 
the ancs deputy president after 27 years in prison the 
government also legalized opposition groups and has announced a 
partial lifting of the state of emergency in effect since 1986 
the anc outlawed for many years for its armed opposition to the 
whiteled government is working to end apartheid in south africa 
and give the vote to its 26 million blacks 
tothill said the steps already taken by the south african 
government should bring an end to sanctions against his country he 
said australia and canada should drop their continued trade and 
sporting sanctions 
australia and canada should face the fact that unless they 
take the lead nothing will change said tothill it is about 
time that these important members of the commonwealth established a 
bottom line for themselves and fixed the goalposts firmly in the 
ground so that they cannot again be shifted 
australian foreign affairs minister gareth evans said sanctions 
against south africa would not be lifted because not enough has 
changed yet 
the separate amenities act has been repealed but there are 
many other pillars of apartheid still remaining intact including 
in particular the constitutional prohibition on black people 
voting said evans 
it may be that it will be time to start progressively lifting 
the sanctions before all those pillars have been removed but i do 
not think anybody is going to rush in to lift sanctions

a crowd of 1000 people did 40000 worth 
of damage in and near the south dakota state university campus when 
weekend homecoming revelry turned to rioting authorities said 
court appearances were scheduled for today for some of the 50 
people arrested those who were scheduled in court face felony 
charges in connection with overturning a television news car 
belonging to sioux falls station ksfy 
the damage occurred friday night and saturday night during the 
hobo day homecoming weekend at sdsu a statesupported school with 
an enrollment of more than 7000 students 
several hundred people marched across campus toward downtown 
saturday tearing down signs and light poles three fires were 
started near the campus and some students pelted authorities with 
eggs and beer bottles when they responded to the fires 
reports indicated a campus police officer was kicked in the back 
and a firefighter dislocated his shoulder as he worked to put out 
one of the blazes both were treated at a hospital and released 
by sunday morning few signs remained of the violence except for 
the cardboard cartons and beer cans littering many streets near the 
campus 
frankly i think its inexcusable said university president 
robert wagner he said the school would take steps to try to change 
student behavior 
it doesnt reflect well on our university and it doesnt 
reflect well on our students in general wagner said 
he called the violence the worst in years 
most of the arrests were on misdemeanor charges including 
intentional damage to property aggravated assault alcohol 
violations interfering with police work and fleeing police 
officers police chief dennis falken said most of those arrested 
were students 
this was nuts said shane mckay an sdsu junior who lives 
near the site of one of the bonfires a little group of people 
being drunk and stupid started it everybody just followed them to 
see what had happened 
although parties and mischief have been a part of hobo day some 
believe the violence has gotten worse in recent years since the 
legal drinking age was raised to 21 younger students cant be in 
the bars anymore so they attend offcampus house parties

iran demanded today that iraq free an 
iranian oil minister who was captured 10 years ago and said it 
refused to believe that he was killed when he fell into enemy hands 
at the outset of the iraniraq war 
the dispute over the captured minister comes just as the two 
nations have begun to improve relations 
iraq began improving ties with iran so it could move hundreds of 
thousands of troops off its border toward saudi arabia where they 
have been in a standoff with a multinational force since iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
irans official islamic republic news agency demanded the 
immediate release of the oil minister mohammed tondguyan 
tondguyan was believed to have been wounded and captured by iraqi 
forces while visiting a border oil field in october 1980 a month 
after the outbreak of the iraniraq war 
he was not among 75000 prisoners of war of both sides who were 
exchanged following the improvement of relations between the former 
combatants irna said iraqi officials claimed at the end of the 
exchange that tondguyan was killed during the iraqi attack on the 
oilfield 
but the iranian official overseeing the pow exchange mohammad 
nazaran was quoted by irna as saying iran had live and 
documented evidence that tondguyan is alive and being held in a 
secret iraqi prison 
if iraq has good will it should release him immediately he 
was quoted as saying in the report which is monitored in nicosia 
the iraqis claim all the iranian prisoners were repatriated in 
the monthlong swap which was abruptly halted last month without 
any explanation from either side 
the iranians and the international committee of the red cross 
which coordinated the exchange maintain iraq still holds several 
thousand iranians 
nazaran said iran is waiting for information about 24000 
iranian prisoners whose fate was not known 
prisoners refusing to be repatriated would be interviewed by 
officials of the international red cross according to 
international regulations prisoners cannot be repatriated against 
their will 
nazaran accused the red cross of being influenced by the 
iraqbased iranian opposition group mujahedeen khalq or 
peoples holy warriors in discouraging many iranian prisoners from 
returning home 
iran and iraq resumed formal diplomatic relations last week but 
the pow issue has caused a chill in the improved climate 
iraqi president saddam hussein under heavy international 
pressure following his invasion of kuwait accepted iranian peace 
terms in midaugust 
the terms included shared sovereignty over the shattalarab 
waterway iraqi withdrawal from occupied iranian territory and the 
exchange of prisoners

the chairman of the national endowment for the 
arts has rejected a 40000 grant to support an exhibit at a boston 
museum by an artist whose work includes sexual themes a museum 
official said today 
the institute of contemporary art received formal notification 
last week that nea chairman john e frohnmayer had rejected the 
grant which had been recommended for approval by a review 
committee said arthur cohen the icas marketing director 
the money was earmarked for an exhibition by mike kelley a 
mixedmedia artist from los angeles museum officials said 
it is almost unprecedented in the history of the nea that an 
application for a gallery is approved by a peer review panel and 
then gets rejected by the director said cohen 
ica director david a ross said kelleys work deals with 
serious and critical issues in our culture some of which deal with 
the pathology of our times some of which deal with the body and 
references to sexuality and sociology some of which deal with 
nationality and nationalism some of which deal with madness and 
particular forms of modern schizophrenic behavior 
ross said it was unlikely frohnmayer would reverse his decision 
he said he did not know why the director objected to kelleys 
exhibit 
earlier this year frohnmayer rejected four other grants that 
had been recommended by review panels those grants were to 
individual artists involved in controversial works not a museum or 
gallery 
cohen said about twothirds of all applications submitted to the 
nea are rejected by the peer panels and that the artists approved 
for grants are heavily scrutinized 
this is a show about a very important artist cohen said 
the nea controversy began last year when sen jesse helms 
rnc and other conservatives in congress objected to nea funding 
of works by photographer robert mapplethorpe and andres serrano 
they start with the easiest things first photography and 
performance where there is less of a historical precedent and 
then they get down to censorship of other kinds of work kelley 
told the boston globe 
the peer panel recommended the 40000 grant after reviewing the 
icas application for 60000 
the kelley exhibit was scheduled to originate in boston and tour 
other museums across the nation and in europe were going to do 
the show no matter what said ica curator elizabeth sussman

parliament today ousted the 
communist party chief from its upper house after his criticisms of 
government reforms prompted 
nationwide anticommunist protests 
the dismissal of communist chairman vasil mohorita followed 
president vaclav havels firing last week of gen miroslav vacek as 
defense minister to regain civilian control of the military after 
four decades of communist rule 
stepping up the anticommunist campaign ahead of local elections 
in november havel today renewed his call for the abolition of the 
warsaw pact saying it is an outdated tool of stalinist 
expansion 
mohorita was dismissed today from the 40member parliament 
presidium the upper house in the 300seat bicameral national 
assembly that can pass legislation whenever the lower chamber is 
not in session 
presidium members are chosen by the lower house in proportion to 
the popular vote for each party the lower chamber legislators in 
the lower chamber the house of the people voted 11786 to replace 
him the state news agency ctk reported mohorita will remain a 
deputy in the lower house 
ctk did not say who would replace him in the presidium 
there was no official word on why mohorita was replaced but his 
criticism of government reforms aimed at dismantling centralized 
communist rule and introducing a market economy probably played a 
key role his comments were criticized by officials and caused 
anticommunist protests nationwide 
in a speech published earlier this month mohirita said high 
unemployment and inflation from the reforms would be unacceptable 
he urged a hard and uncompromising struggle the economic 
reforms have been developed by finance minister vaclav klaus 
increasingly seen as a more conservative rival to havel 
in a broadcast on state radio havel today said czechoslovakia 
would propose to abolish the warsaw pacts joint military command 
at a summit of the military alliance in budapest hungary on nov 
34 
the warsaw pact is outdated and it has lost its meaning 
it was created as a tool of stalinist expansion havel said 
sovietled warsaw pact forces invaded czechoslovakia to crush 
the 1968 attempt to reform communist government there a hardline 
government was installed that ruled until a popular uprising in 
november 1989 
waning soviet influence and the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
eastern europe has also prompted calls for dissolution from other 
former moscow satellites such as hungary 
hungary has said it will withdraw from the military part of the 
warsaw pact next year if it is not dissolved before then 
havel acknowledged the need for the pact to continue in 
existence as a practical tool in arms reduction talks but 
stressed that full abolition of the alliance should be the final 
objective

federations is intended to press for a wage increase president 
corazon aquino has said is unrealistic

the fax machine is making the wheels of 
justice turn a little more smoothly these days in california 
a twoyear experiment approved this year by the legislature lets 
lawyers file lawsuits and probate and family law documents by 
facsimile machine 
attorneys say it helps them beat deadlines as well as traffic in 
carclogged california where papers usually are delivered by 
messenger or by lawyers themselves 
like everybody else we wait until the last minute and 
sometimes things are developing until the last minute said delph 
wilson a personalinjury lawyer in los angeles youre in your 
office pacing back and forth like a father in the maternity ward 
while your secretary is pounding it out and youre hoping the 
messenger gets there on time 
smaller court clerks offices around the state receive documents 
directly on their own fax machines 
in los angeles the most clogged court system in the state with 
more than 10000 documents filed daily in los angeles county 
superior court alone the clerks office is not equipped to receive 
a flood of fax transmissions 
instead fax court filings inc a company formed by 30 attorney 
service firms in the area accepts fax transmissions of documents 
to its office then walks them over to the los angeles county 
courthouse nearby 
andrew estin president of fax court filings inc said fax 
filings have saved attorneys from missing the statutory deadline 
for suing in one case he said a lawyer faxed a petition for a 
stay of execution 
the realities of filing documents in metropolitan areas of 
california are traffic and parking he said its often 
difficult to get a document to the court by the filing deadline 
fax filings must meet specific requirements including the type 
of paper used fax court filings inc receives the documents on 20 
sophisticated laser printing fax machines using bond paper instead 
of the slippery thermal stuff 
the filing of certain documents such as wills and codicils by 
fax is prohibited otherwise signatures on faxed documents 
generally are acceptable 
at the end of the experiment the legislature will decide 
whether to make the program permanent 
minnesota was the first to try fax machines in such a way in 
october 1987 after a yearlong experiment machines were ordered 
installed in all state courts 
other states that have fax transmission in at least some courts 
include colorado idaho florida nevada new york oregon and 
washington 
tony nevarez former lobbyist for the california state bar said 
faxing was seen as a way to save clients and lawyers money by 
eliminating messengers he said the only opposition came from 
process servers who feared losing business 
frank zolin los angeles county clerk and executive officer of 
the superior court said services such as estins are working well 
but that less than 1 percent of documents are being filed by fax 
people are slow to adapt to change said zolin i see it 
as a real convenience but its not a revolutionary change is 
mainly a convenience to the litigants and attorneys 
in some cases zolin said judges and lawyers will continue to 
demand original documents but he said the fax is a boon for 
outofstate firms 
estin whose service was launched in june said business has 
been slow but in five years everybodys going to be doing it

president saddam hussein has agreed to 
release some sick and elderly americans held in iraq the leader of 
the americaniraqi association said today 
there is a definite commitment by the iraqi leadership that 
some americans will be released said salim mansour who is 
leading a delegation that met with saddam on sunday night 
i would call the meeting very constructive he said we 
dont want to talk about figures or names at the moment but im 
happy to announce that some good news will come up 
it was presumed mansour was talking about americans held in iraq 
and kuwait which saddam annexed after his aug 2 invasion of the 
emirate saddam considers kuwait iraqs 19th province 
about 700 americans are being held in kuwait and more than 300 
in iraq many at strategic sites to deter a possible attack by the 
usled multinational forces arrayed against iraq in the persian 
gulf 
before the invasion about 3500 americans were living in iraq 
and its oilrich neighbor saddam has allowed women and children to 
leave and some men have managed to escape overland to jordan and 
saudi arabia iraq also has allowed american men of arab descent to 
leave on commercial flights 
western diplomatic sources said on condition of anonymity that 
they had no independent confirmation of mansours claim but we 
understand that what mansour is saying could turn out to be true 
the diplomatic sources said they understood the americans to be 
released were all sick and elderly americans the diplomats 
said between 47 and 57 americans were in that category

the kgb and interior ministry today announced a 
crackdown on black marketeers and lawmakers voted for a new law 
against speculation stepping up an official soviet assault on 
the shadow economy 
the actions follow two presidential decrees aimed at breaking 
the black markets hold on many state supplies and a reform plan 
designed to transform the centrally planned economy into a partial 
market system 
for the transition we want to try to put more order in our 
economy kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov said at a news conference 
with other officials 
interior ministry chief vadim bakatin agreed but said the 
targets of the crackdown might someday pull the country from its 
economic morass i believe the shadow economy will be supplanted 
by law and commodity relations but its clear that we will have to 
get through a transition he said 
we will have to have intermediate legislation for this period 
to support the economy while we hold criminal tendencies in 
check he said stealing and embezzling should not have a place 
in the new economy 
across town at the kremlin the supreme soviet legislature gave 
preliminary approval to a bill to toughen responsibility for 
wrongdoing in trading and for speculation and black marketeering 
tass said 
the bill which will undergo further debate defined speculation 
as the purchase of goods from state trading outlets and consumer 
cooperatives and their resale for profit it makes the activity 
punishable by up to three years in jail and confiscation of 
property or corrective labor for up to two years and a fine 
higher penalties would be imposed for severe crimes 
kryuchkov and bakatin were vague about what kinds of activity 
would be prosecuted activities ranging from purchase of hard 
currency to reselling of stateproduced goods now are outlawed 
officials said only crimes that harmed citizens would be 
prosecuted but it remained unclear how those activities would be 
defined 
if somebody goes to a village to buy food then sells it in a 
market in moscow that wouldve have been punished under old laws 
but no longer justice minister veniamin yakovlev told the news 
conference 
but it would be illegal if a person buys goods at a state 
store for subsidized state prices then goes around the corner 
and sells those goods at a higher price this is no service to the 
people he said

arkansas attorney general accused of 
wining and dining friends family and political supporters on his 
stateissued visa card says hes guilty of no more than sloppy 
recordkeeping 
jury selection began today in pulaski county circuit court at 
steve clarks trial on one charge of theft by deception with his 
attorney quizzing potential jurors on their attitude toward 
politicians and lawyers 
in february the allegations forced clark to give up his 
candidacy for the democratic nomination for governor improving 
gov bill clintons reelection chances 
if convicted clark 43 could get up to 20 years in jail and a 
15000 fine 
as the trial opened clarks attorney bill bristow told 
potential jurors his client had two strikes against him 
one of the problems ive got with this case is my client is a 
lawyer he said lots of people dont like lawyers my client 
is also a politician and ive heard people say they dont care 
much for politicians the fact that my client is a lawyer and a 
politician does that create any problem 
a pool of 48 prospective jurors was called for questioning with 
jury selection expected to last two days 
two pool members were dismissed this morning because of their 
association with clark one was excused because he works for a 
utility on ratesetting cases in which clarks office is also 
involved and the other had worked in political campaigns 
including clarks past campaigns 
among those subpoenaed to testify at the trial are rep tommy 
robinson rark and arkansas chief justice in addition 
defenses list of prospective witnesses includes clinton and lt 
gov winston bryant 
clark attorney general since 1979 is accused of improperly 
billing taxpayers at least 844827 on his credit card for meals 
56 times from 1986 to 1989 the amount included 201238 for tips 
and alcohol state law prohibits the purchase of alcohol on state 
expense accounts 
he reported as business expenditures meals with people who say 
they didnt eat with him or that it wasnt business some who ate 
with him said they paid the tab 
after the allegations arose clark reimbursed the state 
395129 he blamed poor recordkeeping and said records of the 
meetings were reconstructed from notes his calendar receipts or 
memory every two to three months 
the attorney general whose job includes giving state agencies 
his interpretation of the constitution and laws also said he an 
elected official wasnt required to keep itemized records required 
of other state employees 
prosecutor chris piazza says clark entertained supporters on the 
taxpayers tab to generate campaign contributions that ended up in 
his pocket 
to support his lifestyle he would wine and dine some of his 
biggest contributors at the states expense piazza said at a 
hearing 
piazza has said clark was in poor financial shape and that the 
contributions were deposited in his personal account 
the attorney generals salary is 26500 among the lowest for 
the office in the nation as mandated by the arkansas constitution 
clark also gets 1250 a month in public relations money with no 
itemized accounting required 
he was charged july 11 and released on 2500 bail after the 
discrepancies were revealed by the arkansas gazette jan 28 eight 
days earlier clark announced his candidacy for governor

they may have a fancy title but the folks 
who met here over a banana split luncheon recently were just a 
bunch of jerks and proud of it 
of course thats an old joke for the 20 or so members of the 
national advisory council of the national association of soda 
jerks and their business in omaha was serious stuff they want to 
preserve americas past 
more specifically they want to preserve that part of americas 
past that dispenses ice cream and sodas from behind counters in 
drug stores 
the organization is dedicated to the preservation of american 
nostalgia said its president and founder betty j davis 
between bites of her split 
ms davis conceive of the organization after helping organize a 
series of annual soda jerk reunions at omahas western heritage 
museum the event ended in 1988

a search for soda jerks and fountains since then she said she 
has heard from 300 former soda jerks across the country and the 
organization has registered 50 soda fountains

existing fountain and plans to publish a list of soda fountains 
along with the memories of former soda jerks in 1992 
gary laughlin of george jay drug co in shenandoah iowa said 
his fountain is 102 years old but it isnt the oldest 
people will ask do you care if i take a picture we see it 
every day so i guess we dont realize that there arent as many 
around as there used to be laughlin said 
ms davis said her interest in soda fountains stems from her 
parents 
she said her mother was a soda jerk at oard drug store in 
council bluffs where she was courted by her father who said she 
made the best malts in town

democrat joe brennan and republican john 
r mckernan traded jobs four years ago when mckernan became 
governor and brennan headed for congress 
now brennan wants his old job back and hes waging a oneissue 
campaign in which he accuses mckernan of setting the state up for a 
postelection budget crisis 
brennan has been trumpeting the doomsday theme so loudly that 
mckernan describes him as joey one note the governor has spent 
much of the campaign answering brennans attacks 
mckernan boasts that maine has been spared the mess of 
massachusetts where the booming economy that once was touted as 
the massachusetts miracle has gone sour 
its an awful quibbling campaign its a bore said 
joseph sewall a republican activist and former maine senate 
president its a you did you didnt kind of campaign 
pollsters say the race is so close that the outcome could hinge 
on the performance of independent candidate andrew adam a 
political newcomer who portrays himself as a tax and 
budgetchopping populist 
recent polls show adam pulling less than 5 percent of the vote 
but that could make a difference brennan holds a small advantage 
with 46 percent support to mckernans 39 percent in a survey with a 
margin of error of 4 percentage points mckernan was down 12 
percentage points in september 
this thing could come down to the wire says kenneth hayes 
chairman of the political science department at the university of 
maine in orono and a onetime democratic congressional nominee 
the economy remains the major issue 
last spring mckernan approved a deficitreduction package the 
democratic legislature had enacted acrosstheboard cuts in 
spending and deferred numerous tax breaks 
a taxamnesty program aimed at encouraging delinquents to pay up 
was launched and the state threw in with the lotto america game to 
raise money 
but brennan contends maine will enter 1991 facing a 100 
millionplus deficit and the biggest fiscal mess in the states 
history 
he says mckernans program is based on faulty assumptions it 
counts on a nearly 14percent growth in revenues nearly 190 
million the bulk of it materializing after the election he says 
theres just no indication that those things are going to grow 
like that none brennan said during a recent campaign swing 
through mckernan country 
obviously they want to try to camouflage it the best they 
can he said they know this no one knows any better than 
them they know those monies arent going to come in 
mckernan denies theres any evidence of a looming budget crisis 
i dont expect applause from joe brennan but frankly if 
he were concerned about the people of the state he would be 
applauding he says 
mckernan notes that the state has gotten through so far without 
tax increases however neither he nor brennan has ruled out tax 
increases in the next four years 
brennan 55 succeeded mckernan in southern maines 1st 
congressional district in the 1986 election he was barred by state 
law from seeking a third consecutive term as governor 
at the same time mckernan 42 succeeded brennan as governor 
last year mckernan married maines other us house member 
republican rep olympia j snowe 
mckernan aided by campaign appearances by president bush and a 
procession of bush cabinet members has raised the most money 
13 million through midseptember brennan who has received 
similar help from senate majority leader george j mitchell 
accumulated 11 million 
mckernan continues to try to change the focus of the campaign 
he contends that as governor brennan filled highlevel 
government jobs with cronies and was excessively lenient and showed 
favoritism to political friends in granting pardons and 
commutations 
i believe joe brennan when he says he has compassion 
mckernan said ive got compassion too but its for the victims 
of violent crimes 
brennan dismisses the criticism as unfounded singling out the 
cronyism charge as baloney of the first order

a moderate earthquake awoke a number of 
residents in southeast alaska around midnight but there were no 
reports of damage or injuries authorities said 
the quake had a magnitude of 45 on the richter scale according 
to a preliminary reading said george carte a seismologist with 
the alaska tsunami warning center 
the temblor was recorded at 1158 pm about 40 miles west of 
haines in glacier bay national park and preserve carte said 
it was felt pretty good and it woke up a few people carte 
said but its a typical event for that area glacier bay is a 
place where we record a fair number of quakes 
the earthquake was too small to generate a tsunami threat he 
said 
it was an attentiongetter but it was nothing of any 
consequence carte said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of magnitude 4 moderate damage and 5 considerable 
damage if it strikes a populated area

the resolution trust corp faced with a 
limited pool of outside talent to help clean up the savings and 
loan mess has bent its ethics rules to do business with some 
companies 
the rtc the federal agency responsible for disposing of 
hundreds of collapsed sampls is signing on about 1000 new 
contractors a week and could soon rival the defense department as a 
lucrative source of government contracts 
at the same time there is a limited number of outside 
companies such as accounting firms with the expertise the rtc 
needs because the 500 billion savings and loan scandal is so 
farreaching many of the companies with the knowhow needed to 
resolve it have been touched by it in some way 
all of a sudden you find yourself with very few horses in the 
corral that arent lame in some way said caryl austrian a 
spokeswoman for the federal deposit insurance corp 
another worry for the rtc is the potential for fraud by outside 
contractors the agency said this summer that it planned to hire 
special employees to watch for possible corruption as it sells sampl 
assets but the 20 to 30 contractor cops and their boss havent 
been hired yet said rtc spokeswoman lezley norris 
the rtc has bent its rules by granting conflictofinterest 
waivers to 11 companies from big accounting firms to mortgage 
companies and real estate brokerages documents examined by the 
associated press show many of the companies are the objects of 
lawsuits that the rtc and the fdic inherited from seized banks and 
sampls 
seven more companies also have received waivers but information 
on them is not yet publicly available kate spears another rtc 
spokeswoman said monday 
in granting the waivers regulators decided that the lawsuits 
dont indicate a pattern of wrongdoing by the companies as a whole 
only by some individuals but the waivers also impose certain 
operating conditions on the companies designed to avoid future 
conflicts 
the waivers cleared the way for the rtc to award millions of 
dollars in contracts to the companies which are helping the agency 
evaluate and sell assets of the failed thrifts it has taken over 
the rtcs contractors conflicts committee has given waivers in 
all the cases of that type it has considered ms norris said 
many of the companies receiving waivers are accounting firms 
the accounting industry has been rocked by a merger wave in recent 
years that has reduced the number of big firms which are often the 
most qualified to do complex sampl work 
some accounting giants are targets of direct government suits 
alleging shoddy audit work for failed sampls and banks these 
generally do not do contracting work for the rtc 
but other big accountants named in suits filed by sampls and 
inherited by the government when it took over the thrifts have 
been allowed to do business with the rtc through the waivers three 
coopers amp lybrand grant thornton and laventhol amp horwath 
received waivers from the contractors conflicts committee in june 
and july 
in an effort to avoid future conflicts the waivers require the 
companies to screen out employees involved in the litigation and 
prevent them from working on new rtc contracts 
those conditions can be timeconsuming and costly for the 
contractors said michael oneill a partner in coopers amp lybrands 
washington office 
you have to know where everyone is and what theyre doing 
he said 
other companies receiving waivers from the rtc are cushman amp 
wakefield inc the nations secondlargest commercial real estate 
company kidder peabody and co a major financial company verex 
mortgage corp and flusche van bevern amp kilgore

congress may be talking about taxing 
millionaires but they have other concerns just now 
you see old chap the cost of champagne is simply popping 
through the roof 
nobody can afford the french prices any more said mauricio 
de fendi wine manager at scotti wines amp liquors americans are 
experts in selling everything but the french are stylish they 
say we dont want to sell for a low price 
a year ago the wine cask in palm beach gardens sold a gift set 
of a bottle of dom perignon rose champage and a 110 set of two 
baccarat crystal glasses for a combined 250 
today it costs 230 just for the champagne 
producers attribute the champagne crisis in part to the fall of 
the us dollar and in part to a toosuccessful marketing 
campaign 
democratization can sometimes go too far explained 
christian bizot chairman of the bollinger champagne house 
during the past decade french champagne producers marketed 
their product toward the masses they did such a good job that 
worldwide sales last year hit 250 million bottles up 75 percent 
since 1982 
our sales have gone up much too fast said jeanmichel 
ducellier president of the ayala champagne house and chairman of 
the association of champagne producers we have kept our prices 
too low 
people who now pay 24 for a bottomoftheline bottle of moet amp 
chandon taittinger or bollinger soon may have to spend 30 or more 
for a bottle and the topoftheline bottles are expected to go 
from 80 to about 100 a bottle by the end of the year 
patrick poupart the wine consultant at hampton liquors in palm 
beach said the higher prices will drive many champagne buyers to 
sparkling wines from california and spain 
still de fendi said its bound to affect the lower end of the 
market more than the higher end 
the people who buy moet for 20 or 30 a bottle complain when 
it goes up a dollar he said but the people who buy dom 
perignon wont care if it was 200 a bottle theyd just say 
fine and throw their credit card on the counter

mandalay and detained some of those inside state radio reported 
monks who have been at the forefront of antigovernment 
protests had been refusing to minister to soldiers 
but on sunday reports reaching the capital rangoon sid the 
monks had given up their boycott after troops ringed at least six 
monasteries defiant monks also were threatened with the death 
penalty 
official rangoon radio said troops raided mandalays phayagyi 
monastery monday morning and searched 139 of its buildings 
some people were detained and action would be taken against 
them the radio said it did not say how many were detained or if 
any of them were monks 
the radio said the search would be extended to 11 other 
monasteries in the city that were surrounded by troops 
mandalay is burmas secondlargest city and its religious 
center 
buddhist monks in mandalay and other burmese cities began a 
boycott of the army after soldiers put down a prodemocracy 
demonstration there on aug 8 reportedly killing four people 
including two monks 
government television showed footage of the monastery search and 
displayed pamphlets duplicating machines political badges rubber 
stamps and other items allegedly seized during the raid 
the troops also seized sling shots and other weapons the radio 
report said 
the pamphlets included publications of the outlawed burma 
communist party the radio said the military government has 
persistently accused prodemocracy forces of links to the virtually

illegal monks organizations to end their ban on performing 
religious ceremonies for soldiers on sunday it empowered army 
commanders to try monks involved in politics under martial law

three years in prison to a maximum of death 
according to rangoon radio 29 monks in mandalay and nearly 200

a young lawyer says threatening phone 
calls and a dousing with beer at her alma mater helped her land the 
perfect job at an iowa law school 
and now her 11year legal battle against princeton university 
set off by that beer dousing when she tried to join one of the 
schools allmale eating clubs might bring her a chance to argue 
before the us supreme court 
this could have an effect on fraternities and sororities 
across the country said sally b frank 
its already made a mark on frank 31 who this semester became 
an assistant law professor at drake university 
her lawsuit against princeton gave her a reputation as a 
troublemaker by the time she got her law degree from new york 
university in 1983 
i did have trouble getting a job she said 
she finally landed one as law clerk for a new york civil court 
judge and later taught a landlordtenant clinic at antioch law 
school in washington and a discrimination clinic at new york law 
school 
the assistant professor post in drakes law school is focused on 
running its legal clinic supervising law students handling cases 
of poor neighborhood residents and university students and staff 
frank said she thinks drake considered her background and the 
princeton case before hiring her 
i think it showed an ability to take on a difficult and 
unusual and complex piece of litigation and to work it through and 
they were interested in that for the clinic frank said they 
knew pretty much what they were getting and i havent felt them 
unhappy with what they got 
frank took on princeton and its three remaining allmale eating 
clubs when she was a junior 
the clubs which frank said provide a dining and social 
function similar to fraternities arose after the university 
banned fraternities in 1856 and then lost its dining hall in a 
fire 
the clubs allow women at everything they just want to keep 
them in a secondclass status by not allowing them to be members 
frank said of the tiger inn cottage club f scott fitzgeralds 
club and the ivy club the schools oldest and most prestigious 
frank wanted to join one about a dozen years ago i went to an 
event at their club for people planning to join she said one 
member poured beer on me and 20 to 30 members started chanting 
lets throw sally frank in the fountains 
then she got obscene and threatening telephone calls 
they denied me membership but more importantly i felt that 
they were having a negative effect on campus by increasing sexism 
at the university 
she sued the clubs and the university in february 1979 
she and a cocounsel from the new jersey american civil 
liberties union argued that the clubs were public groups affiliated 
with princeton and that their maleonly policy violated new 
jerseys law against discrimination the clubs lawyers argued they 
were private groups free to bar anyone they wanted under their 
federal right to freedom of association 
on july 3 the ew jersey supreme court ordered the clubs to 
admit women and to pay frank 5000 in damages 
the ivy club admitted 15 women at the beginning of this month 
the cottage club admitted women in 1986 when it and princeton 
settled with frank 
but tiger inns members voted oct 9 to retain their ban on 
women shortly after their lawyer russel h beatie jr 
petitioned the us supreme court to hear the case 
this is not an issue involving 125 overprivileged kids in a 
richkids school in new jersey beatie said this is an issue 
affecting 7000 fraternities and sororities with a membership 
totaling roughly 9 million as well as social organizations of 
all kinds 
frank isnt intimidated by the appeal she notes that the high 
court has ruled on the issue three times since 1974 ordering the 
jaycees rotary clubs and elite new york social clubs to admit 
women 
and besides she said i think every lawyer always has the 
dream of arguing a case before the supreme court its kind of the 
ultimate

for the job after being seriously injured in a september plane 
crash that killed his wife

santor in the primary by a margin of 60 percent to 32 percent 
seale 49 had been active for years in the state republican 
party but wasnt widely known until the crash 
democrat ray shaffer 57 has urged seale to withdraw from the 
race until hes able to prove his mental and physical fitness to 
tackle the job of handling the states investment portfolio 
shaffer also contends seales judgment woud be impaired because of 
pain medication 
mr seale unfortunately must still be suffering from 
considerable pain shaffer said just to take the pain 
suppressants has to hamper the judgment of the individual 
however aide brian krolicki said seale was taking no pain 
medication 
seale was hospitalized until oct 11 with burns and broken 
bones he officially returned to the campaign trail oct 16 
despite metal pins keeping the bones of his left forearm in place

building director when the legislature isnt in session also has 
questioned seales qualifications for the post 
seale a managing partner of pangborn amp co has 20 years 
accounting experience and has given investment advice to clients 
im sure hes made out a lot of income tax returns for people 
but that doesnt make him an investment expert shaffer said 
shaffer said he would solicit advice from outside companies to 
recommend a investment strategy 
once an investment policy is in place it is very easy to 
follow he said

law schools should require students to donate 
their services to people who cant afford legal representation a 
group of law students said monday 
we find that it is really outrageous that people can go 
through three years of law school and never be exposed to the legal 
problems of someone who cant afford a lawyer said harvard law 
student steve donzinger a member of law students for pro bono 
we are asking our educators to say these problems are 
important enough to incorporate into our education he said at a 
news conference here 
the group wants each of the nations 175 accredited law schools 
to incorporate a pro bono requirement into their traditional 
courses of legal study by 2000 lawyers and other professional 
dont charge for pro bono services 
donzinger said fewer than one in six lawyers or law students 
performs any pro bono work even though american bar association 
guidelines say its members should perform 50 hours of such work 
annually 
as many as 1 million people could receive needed legal services 
if each of the nations 129000 law students performed 100 hours of 
pro bono work a year donzinger said 
consumer advocate ralph nader who spoke on behalf of the 
students efforts said the legal profession was becoming too 
profitoriented 
its not just the poor who are being deprived he said 
the law is a very noble institution that has been ennobled by its 
practitioners the practice of law is not just for commercial gain 
its for the advancement of justice 
pro bono requirements have been adopted by tulane university and 
florida state university nader said adding that several other law 
schools including hawaii harvard and ucla are considering such 
programs

with their pockets full of iraqi dinars hundreds 
of iraqi visitors have descended on kuwait buying everything they 
can 
a group of baghdadbased journalists went to kuwait over the 
weekend on a trip arranged by the government to discredit western 
media reports that iraqi soldiers were plundering the occupied 
emirate 
during the visit it appeared that kuwait a thriving business 
center before the aug 2 invasion is slowly but steadily becoming 
more and more iraqi 
saddams photographs are everywhere just as in iraq more and 
more vehicles are displaying iraqi license plates and there are no 
signs of kuwaiti armed resistance 
i feel here like at home said kamal abbas a visiting iraqi 
businessman there are no visas no border checkpoints and no 
need for reexport license 
i buy anything and everything he said referring to the 
supply of consumer goods that surpasses what he can find at home 
bashar mubarak a kuwaiti businessman selling household goods in 
the citys nigras district was asked what he thought about the 
presence of his iraqi counterpart 
who cares he replied money is not an important thing 
right now 
iraqi officials strongly deny reports that there may be a chance 
for a compromise solution of the persian gulf crisis they say they 
will never give back any of kuwait 
after decades kuwait has become what it should be part of 
iraq said shihab ahmed aljassim the new head of kuwaits 
education department 
out of 500 schools at least 108 are open said aljassim who 
formerly was head of education in basra iraqs secondlargest 
city 
all the schools have photos of saddam the names of schools that 
bore the names of family members of kuwaits exiled rulers the 
alsabah family are being changed said aljassim 
however some kuwaiti students are not attending school he 
said explaining many kuwaitis were out of the country when iraq 
freed kuwait 
the schools are guarded by volunteers of iraqs popular army 
which also guards all government buildings and nine checkpoints in 
downtown kuwait 
during their 36hour stay the reporters did not hear any 
gunshots 
the iraqi government imposes a curfew daily from 11 pm to 7 
am turning the once busy city into a ghost town 
and even 12 weeks after the invasion people are still fleeing 
kuwait some because they lost their jobs or business others 
because they are unsure about the future 
immigrant workers are waiting to leave but uncertain what will 
happen to them 
i have never been out of kuwait since i came here i do not 
know where to go said mariana niaeshai a housekeeper at a 
hospital who came here six years ago from the philippines

the trial of two teenagers charged with the 
brutal rape and attempted murder of a jogger in central park was 
disrupted just after it opened today when a defendant broke down 
and screamed 
no no no i cant deal with this cried defendant kharey 
wise as four court officers ushered him out of the courtroom i 
cant take this it isnt true 
his outburst which led to an unsuccessful defense request for a 
mistrial came just after assistant district attorney elizabeth 
lederer completed her opening statement the trial is the second 
stemming from last years highly publicized atttack 
lederer said wise 18 and his codefendant kevin richardson 
16 would convict themselves through the statements they gave 
police statments the defense argues were obtained improperly 
as lederer was winding up her remarks wise talked to himself 
rocked in his seat and held his hands to his face as if he was 
praying he bit his lip and pounded his forehead with his fist 
after she finished the judge announced a brief break for the 
jury before the defenses opening remarks as the jury was filing 
out he began crying and yelling he also vomited 
howard diller attorney for richardson asked the judge for a 
mistrial because of the other defendants outburst but as the 
trial resumed after a break the judge denied the mistrial motion 
and warned wise to behave opening arguments for the defense then 
proceeded 
in her statement lederer told jurors that wise and richardson 
were among 30 youths who went into central park the night of april 
19 1989 to beat to rob to assault to attack anyone they 
found in the park 
defense lawyers claim incriminating statements made by wise and 
richardson were coerced from mentally deficient boys but lederer 
said statements from the two youths were freely and voluntarily 
made and are corroborated by other evidence in the case 
the two are among six teens charged with the attack on the 
jogger 
the first trial ended in fiveto10year sentences the maximum 
for juvenile offenders for yusef salaam raymond santana and 
antron mccray all 16 they were convicted of rape assault 
robbery and riot but acquitted of attempted murder and sodomy 
wise 16 at the time of the attacks faces adult penalties that 
could total up to 57 years in prison if he is convicted on all 
counts richardson 14 when he was arrested faces the same five to 
10 years as the three youths convicted in the first trial 
lederer told the jury that the defendants guilt will be proved 
by the testimony of bicyclists joggers police officers medical 
and scientific experts and by the defendants own written and 
videotaped statements 
she said richardson in his videotaped statement described how 
he and the other teenagers hid in the dark behind trees and 
attacked the jogger when she ran past 
she said richardson describes how they ripped her shirt off how 
she screamed for help and how she scratched richardsons face 
lederer said wise made two videotaped statements because he 
admittedly lied to police in the first one she said he 
acknowledged he had gone into the park with a group to do 
violence 
in the second tape he describes how he held her leg and fondled 
it while others raped her 
defense attorney colin moore was rebuffed friday when he asked 
justice thomas galligan to allow expert testimony that wise is not 
smart enough to have knowingly and meaningfully waived his miranda 
rights against selfincrimination moore said wise has an 
intelligence quotient of 73 
diller has said richardson likewise is not intelligent enough to 
have said the things police attributed to him in his statement

before the doors of the jail slammed 
shut behind him asif ali zardari was best known as the playboy 
husband of ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
but when zardari was arrested and jailed oct 10 on charges of 
kidnapping and extortion he became a celebrity in his own right 
in arresting the 38yearold businessman authorities accused 
zardari of kidnapping a pakistaniborn british citizen in april and 
extorting 800000 from him 
zardari vehemently denied the charges saying they were 
fabricated by an armybacked caretaker government bent on 
destroying his wifes political career and her populist pakistan 
peoples party 
this week zardari could well be elected to parliament even ms 
bhuttos critics say her husbands popularity has grown since the 
arrest 
from the darkness of my cell the light of democracy burns 
bright zardari wrote in a plea for justice published in 
urdulanguage newspapers 
when i was arrested i felt proud i joined the people who 
broke the chains of oppression and fought for stability human 
rights and democracy he wrote 
zardari is expected to remain in custody at least until tuesday 
the eve of pakistans parliamentary elections 
he still is a candidate for two seats in wednesdays elections 
in the districts of lyari and nawabshah his home town 
the elections were called after ms bhuttos 20monthold 
government was sacked aug 6 on charges of rampant corruption 
nepotism and abuse of power 
while her husband sat in jail ms bhutto led a milelong 
procession of brightlycolored trucks festooned with banners 
through her husbands home constituency in southern sindh province 
ms bhutto pleaded her husbands case in an emotional speech to 
tens of thousands of party loyalists who waited nearly 12 hours in 
scorching desert heat for her 
an employee of acting prime minister ghulam mustafa jatoi a 
bhutto rival said zardaris popularity has grown since the arrest 
that the arrest was the governments decision and it was a 
mistake said the employee on condition of anonymity 
the arrest has become his badge of honor said a foreign 
diplomat also insisting on anonymity 
lyari a sprawling slum district in the provincial capital of 
karachi was considered a good bet for zardari before he was 
jailed now its believed to be a sure thing even by political 
opponents 
zardari was a favorite target of ms bhuttos opponents during 
her 20 months in power they called him mr 10 percent a 
reference to commissions he allegedly charged for lucrative 
government contracts 
everybody believes he was the root cause of her downfall but 
if her hands were clean how could he get away with so much asked 
jatoi during a campaign stop in his home constituency of new jatoi 
a village neighboring zardaris hometown of nawabshah 
but most pakistanis now dismiss the the corruption issue as 
irrelevant a failed attempt by the caretaker cabinet to portray 
ms bhuttos government as the most corrupt in pakistans 43year 
history 
in the sunbaked streets of nawabshah a squalid village of 
driedmud huts surrounded by imposing 10foot walls people talk 
about the election most people shrug off the charges 
weve read about it but we dont know his family lives in 
the same house in nawabshah we havent seen any change we dont 
know said a local resident who refused to give his name 
the fight in nawabshah is expected to be tough and violent 
people are keeping their vote in their heart said a street 
vendor who declined to give his name for fear of reprisal 
zardari is pitted against jatois son murtaza and most people 
say the acting prime minister has pulled out all the stops for his 
son 
mohammad hashim a local laborer said several people had been 
arrested in nawabshah since jatoi was appointed ms bhuttos 
successor all of them workers for her pakistan peoples party 
while zardaris family is native to nawabshah most residents 
say their loyalty lies with his wife and her deposed father 
zulfikar ali bhutto who was overthrown in a 1977 coup and hanged 
two years later 
zulfikar ali bhutto is considered pakistans first populist 
leader even his detractors say he dismantled the centuriesold 
barriers between pakistans wealthy and and poor 
in the past the poor person couldnt talk to a rich person 
but now he can grab anyone by the throat and make them listen the 
ppp has given us this courage said another nawabshah voter who 
refused to be identified 
bhutto did a lot for us and well vote for him not asif 
zardari

there are more than 300 french citizens in iraq and kuwait 
french leaders have favored linking a solution to the gulf 
crisis with negotiations between israel and the palestinians over 
the israelioccupied territories saddam has tried to make the same 
linkage and in a japanese television interview broadcast today 
said the proposal deserved consideration 
saddams request reported by the official iraqi news agency 
did not say when the parliamentary discussion should take place 
to enforce the un trade embargo on iraq a multinational naval 
force has been patrolling the gulf it has searched numerous 
commercial ships and in a dozen cases warships have fired warning 
shots to halt suspected transgressors 
the latest incident began saturday when us navy and coast 
guard inspectors boarded the iraqi freighter albahar alarabi in 
the persian gulf 
the ship agreed to turn back to iraq because its cargo of 
plywood and steel pipes was prohibited under the sanctions navy 
sources said 
but the freighter continued to sail southward despite the fact 
that the obrien early sunday fired three separate volleys of 
warning shots from its deck and machine guns in an attempt to again 
halt the vessel the sources said 
the obrien and the italian frigate libeccio shadowed the vessel 
overnight 
the boarding team today included 15 men from the australian 
missile frigate hmas aeelaide and 11 from the american frigate uss 
reasoner van sickle said 
the ship had been sailing southward toward the port of aden in 
yemen where there are strong sympathies for saddam and his 
struggle with the west 
the pentagon statement was issued on behalf of us central 
command which is in charge of operation desert shield 
it said the iraqi vessel was found to be no longer carrying 
prohibited material and was allowed to proceed to her original 
destination 
asked what had happened to the ships cargo the us central 
command said wecan only assume it was dumped over the side by 
the crew of the albahar alarabi sometime between her first 
boarding and today 
the iraqi news agency said the ship was leased by a private 
fishing company and carrying fish from the indian ocean and 
african ports

crude oil prices plummeted more than 4 a barrel 
in heavy trading today on optimism about a peaceful solution to the 
persian gulf crisis 
prices tumbled below 30 a barrel in new york and even more 
to below 27 in london the markets appeared to be reacting to 
comments by saudi arabias defense minister prince sultan who 
suggested that arab countries were willing to grant iraq all its 
rights 
the statement has really gotten the markets unsettled said 
andrew lebow an analyst with edf amp man international inc 
there is some expectation that maybe an arabproposed solution 
is in the cards 
by early afternoon on the new york mercantile exchange the 
contract for november delivery of light sweet crude was off 419 
at 2960 a barrel 
the decline comes on the heels of losses friday when the 
november contract settled down 301 a barrel on the mercantile 
exchange 
in london north sea brent blend crude oil for december delivery 
closed at 2675 a barrel down 565 from 3240 late friday 
prices of refined products also fell sharply in new york 
the contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline for november 
delivery which lost more than 5 cents on friday was trading at 77 
cents a gallon on the mercantile exchange by early afternoon down 
a steep 1091 cents 
home heating oil was down about 13 cents a gallon at 7540 cents 
after the nearterm contract lost 811 cents on friday 
the market interpreted the saudi officials comments as a sign 
saudi arabia was prepared to agree to kuwait ceding some land to 
iraq traders pushed prices lower on the belief that this 
development might lead to a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis 
which began when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
activity in london was fairly light as many traders stayed on 
the sidelines waiting out the decline 
were just watching the prices go down said a trader at a 
major international trading house in london 
but dealings in new york were hectic its extremely busy 
one trader said prices opened lower and then there was more 
liquidation 
since the persian gulf crisis began oil prices have fluctuated 
wildly on world markets reaching above 40 a barrel at times 
compared with precrisis levels of 22 a barrel 
north sea brent is a key european barometer of oil prices 
in the united states the price of a gallon of gasoline rose 2 
cents in the past two weeks reaching a national average of 147 
according to a survey released sunday 
the biweekly lundberg survey of 13500 gas stations indicated 
prices have risen more than 40 cents a gallon since iraqs invasion 
of kuwait

genetic parents who paid a surrogate 
mother to bear their testtube baby should raise the boy despite 
the surrogates claim that she wants the child after all a judge 
ruled today 
mark calvert gently kissed his wife crispina as orange county 
superior court judge richard parslow rejected 29yearold surrogate 
mother anna johnsons claim seeking partial custody of the baby 
boy 
i believe he should be raised exclusively by the calverts 
parslow said the baby whom the calverts call christopher is now 
4 weeks old 
the judge said that a threeparent twonaturalmom 
situation would be confusing to the child and invites emotional 
and financial extortion 
the calverts of tustin had agreed to pay ms johnson 10000 
to bear their child which was conceived through in vitro 
fertilization using sperm and egg donated by the calverts mrs 
calvert cant carry a baby because she had a hysterectomy 
ms johnson wasnt in court for the ruling but she had said 
earlier that she would appeal an unfavorable decision 
in the sixday hearing her attorneys tried to show she and the 
baby had developed an unexpected but deep emotional attachment 
during the pregnancy that must not be severed 
the calverts had insisted that they should be recognized as the 
sole parents parslow earlier granted the calverts temporary 
custody of the baby 
attorneys have said the calvertjohnson dispute could break new 
legal ground because a genetically unrelated surrogate never has 
sought custody the famous baby m case in new jersey involved a 
surrogate mother who was also the babys genetic mother 
referring to the calverts and the baby the judge said in 
this case we have a family unit all genetically related 
he said the argument by ms johnsons lawyer that the baby has 
three natural parents is really not in the best interest of the 
child i think the decision im making in this case is 
definitely pro child 
of ms johnson the judge said the calverts entrusted her with 
carrying their child 
the judge said ms johnson appears to be articulate and 
intelligent so i dont think the calverts conned anna into this 
agreement 
ms johnson claimed that the calverts neglected her during the 
pregnancy and were late making payments 
the calverts offered evidence about the importance of the 
genetic link they also attempted to cast doubt on ms johnsons 
motives claiming she was motivated by a thirst for publicity and 
money not love of the child 
the only bonding anna johnson has is with your television 
camera calvert told reporters after the ruling 
ms johnson a single mother of a 3yearold girl and mrs 
calvert 36 met while working as nurses at a santa ana hospital

mimi rogers sees a gleam of hope that women 
may one day achieve equal status in todays macho movie world 
its an unfortunate fact that there are many more roles for 
men than there are for women a favorable sign is the success of 
films like pretty woman and ghosts much more successful than 
big maledominated action films she said 
with these two films in which women are on more of an equal 
level being so successful maybe the trend will start to shift in 
the direction of having men and women really costarring 
upcoming movies seem promising cher and winona ryder costar in 
orions mermaids a sweet relationship movie michelle pfeiffer 
costars with sean connery in the russia house based on the 
john le carre thriller julia roberts stars in next springs 
sleeping with the enemy and academy awardwinner jody foster 
is eagerly awaited as the star of silence of the lambs a taut 
thriller based on the best seller by thomas harris 
if not equal rogers has a vital role in desperate hours 
with mickey rourke and anthony hopkins its dino de laurentiis 
update of the 1955 movie with rogers in the part originated by 
martha scott rourke plays the humphrey bogart role of a criminal 
psycho who takes a suburban family hostage hopkins has the part of 
the husband originally played by fredric march 
the director of the mgm release is michael cimino yes the same 
michael cimino who won an academy award for the deer hunter in 
1978 and made the financial bomb heavens gate in 1980 
rogers remarked that during the desperate hours filming 
cimino was very relaxed very much at ease and enjoying the whole 
process there was an awareness on his part that he wanted to bring 
it in on time and on budget i think we actually finished a week 
early and under budget 
he knows that he knows how to make movies theres no question 
the guy has made some brilliant movies its more a matter of 
reaffirming that he can do it that he can follow a schedule and a 
budget that its no problem and boom theres the movie thats 
what he did 
rogers has three new films desperate hours the doors 
oliver stones biography of rocker jim morrison and the 
rapture an apocalyptic drama last january she and tom cruise 
ended their threeyear marriage during which she seemed to be 
subordinating her own career as his zoomed skyward 
she corrected that impression i actually worked quite a bit 
unfortunately two of the films that i did havent been released in 
this country 
i did a picture for vestron called hider in the house with 
gary busey that got caught up in the companys bankruptcy then i 
did a film with james belushi called to forget palermo we spent 
14 weeks shooting that it was an italianfinanced film an 
english language film with an italian director thats always a 
bit of an experiment she said 
i dont know what happened to it maybe american distributors 
looked at it and thought it wasnt going to make money both of 
those films i think have been released internationally but not 
here so theres an apparent void that didnt really exist 
like her former husband mimi short for miriam rogers had a 
traveling childhood both their fathers were engineers who took 
jobs all over rogers was born in coral gables fla but she moved 
to virginia arizona michigan england and finally los angeles a 
good student she graduated from high school at 14 and started 
acting in her 20s her first film was blue skies again with 
harry hamlin 
her other costars include michael keaton gung ho 
christopher reeve street smart tom berenger someone to 
watch over me and denzel washington the mighty quinn 
she usually plays the love interest but she hopes that will 
change as movies take a feminine tilt

he was known to palestinians as 
the living martyr a youth who clung to life for more than two 
years with a bullet wound suffered in a clash with israeli troops 
mohammed naim abu akar lost his long battle monday succumbing 
to liver and respiratory failure doctors at jerusalems mukassed 
hospital said 
abu akar 18 had survived on intravenous feedings because his 
intestines were all but destroyed by the bullet that hit him in a 
clash in the dheishe refugee camp near bethlehem on aug 6 1988 
an attempt at reconstructive surgery in boston failed 
palestinians have been rebelling against israeli occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip since december 1987 and more than 
3000 of them gathered for abu akars funeral monday in the village 
of irtas south of bethlehem 
mourners marched with scores of outlawed palestinian flags and 
heaped dozens of floral wreaths upon his coffin in bethlehem 
shops offices and schools closed in mourning 
activists used loudspeakers to exhort the crowd anyone who 
wants to mourn mohammed should go out and attack the zionists 
the army did not intervene 
earlier when abu akars death became known the news sparked 
stonethrowing the army imposed a curfew on the dheishe camps 
7000 residents to restore order 
dr khaled abu iqraiah who treated abu akar over the past two 
years at mukassed said the youth would long be remembered 
in the occupied territories he stood as a symbol for the 
victims of the uprising abu iqraiah said he was a dear 
example for many palestinians because he fought to survive for a 
long time 
abu akar was wounded in august 1988 in a stonethrowing clash 
with soldiers it was one of dozens of confrontations he joined as 
an activist with the marxist popular front for the liberation of 
palestine friends said 
the bullet tore into his abdomen damaging both the large and 
small intestines iqraiah said 
he said friends and palestinian human rights groups raised funds 
to help pay for sending abu akar to bostons new england deaconess 
hospital in november and december 1988 for experimental surgery 
when it failed abu akar was brought back to dheishe and kept 
alive on intravenous feeding 
he began to fail two days ago and was moved to mukassed where 
he died in the intensive care unit the doctor said 
palestinians call those killed by the israelis shuhadaa or 
martyrs and they now count abu akar as the 762nd such victim since 
the palestinian uprising began 
with our souls with our blood we will avenge your death 
they chanted at his funeral

a group of nutritionists and chefs have joined 
together to forge a new era of eating to show people there are 
ways to eat healthily and still enjoy good food 
welcome to the meeting of two formerly warring groups the 
taste community and the science community chef julia child said 
when the group met this weekend 
cholesterol warnings mixed messages on caffeine scares over 
chemicals and the allencompassing bad word fat have left many 
fretting over what they eat 
the conference sponsored by the national dairy board and the 
american institute of wine and food attempted to allay peoples 
fears and guilt about eating patterns 
fat is not a fourletter word said jan weimer a food 
consultant and conference organizer it has its place 
dr carl orringer director of preventive cardiology at the 
university of michigan medical center applauded the groups 
efforts but said that ultimately people need to recognize some 
food is not good for them 
the conference sponsors would obviously like to avoid 
eliminating foods that they sponsor he said in reality what 
theyre admitting is if its better to eat less than more then 
maybe its better to eat even less to the point where maybe its 
better not to eat those foods at all 
child noted that chefs traditionally have viewed dieticians and 
nutritionists as the wicked stepmother and the medical 
community has been dubious about chefs 
after months of negotiations and cooking the group agreed on 
some general statements embracing the importance of tasty healthy 
meals 
dr c wayne callaway said people should focus on what they eat 
over longer periods and regular moderate exercise 
were teaching people how to eat rather than what not to 
eat he said 
the group plans to lobby fellow nutritionists and chefs and then 
take their ideas to the public 
callaway believes peer pressure and changing market demands will 
make restaurateurs store owners and even fast food chains change 
their ways

cocaine speeded the growth of the aids virus in 
laboratory tests prompting concern that it could increase infected 
peoples chances of developing the deadly disease researchers 
reported monday 
microbiologists at the university of minnesota medical school 
exposed cells that are the primary target for the aids virus to 
doses of cocaine the virus hiv was found to grow as much as 
three times faster in the cocainelaced tests than in control 
studies 
if what happened in the test tube happens in hivinfected 
cocaine users it could increase their risk of developing aids 
said dr ronald schut the lead researcher 
in persons who are infected if they continue to abuse this 
drug it may have a significant impact on the development of 
clinical aids schut said 
while about 150000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states researchers say a million or more other americans are 
infected and at risk of developing aids 
testtube tests however dont always mimic what happens in the 
human body the question now for researchers is whether drug use 
somehow modifies the immune system to enhance hiv growth in humans 
the initial invitro testtube studies suggest that its 
possible schut said 
schut presented the findings at the interscience conference on 
antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy sponsored by the american 
society for microbiology 
further studies are under way using immune cells from drug users 
in a methadone program where cocaine use is high to see if the 
virus grows easier schut said 
dr james curran director of the division of hivaids at the 
us centers for disease control said little if any solid 
information is available concerning the aids risk of cocaine users 
he added that drug users are notoriously difficult to study and 
many cocaine users are involved in injectable drug abuse which can 
spread hiv by dirty needles 
nearly onefourth of the aids cases reported in this country 
stem from intravenous drug use according to the cdc 
curran said that while the minnesota test results may be 
correct of greater concern is the practice of trading cocaine for 
sex leading to the spread of the aids virus by sexual contact 
still as far as cocaine is concerned curran said i think 
its safe to recommend dont do it 
also at the microbiology conference monday 
curran predicted that homosexual men will still make up a 
large proportion of aids cases five years from now despite the 
increase in aids among intravenous drug users and their sex 
partners half of last years aids cases in the united states 
involved gay men he said 
dr douglas richman an aids specialist at the university of 
california san diego predicted that even without an aids vaccine 
combination drug treatments will enable infected people to live 
normal lives and approach normal lifespans 
a patient with hiv will be treated similarly to a patient with 
diabetes or hypertension prevent the progression of disease and 
maintain the quality of life richman said 
complications from high blood pressure and diabetes can be 
controlled and reduced with drug treatment and so will various 
complications of hiv infection he said 
development of an aids vaccine is a concept that is 
achievable said dr lawrence corey an aids specialist at the 
university of washington in seattle but cocktail vaccines 
combating various hiv strains arent at the human trial stage yet 
and the protection offered by some vaccines tested in animals has 
tended so far to be quite short in duration he said 
because of the risk involved in testing a wholevirus aids 
vaccine its more likely that researchers will aim for development 
of a subunit vaccine utilizing only pieces of the aids virus 
he said

republicans sharply criticized the senate 
ethics committee today for delaying a crucial ruling in the cases 
of five senators who assisted former savings and loan executive 
charles h keating jr 
the republicans demanded that the committee headed by sen 
howell heflin dala act before adjournment this week on a 
special counsels recommendation that two senators be dropped from 
the probe and three others remain subjets of an intensified 
inquiry 
heflin defended the timetable citing work conflicts by 
senators 
the criticism was led by sen john mccain of arizona the only 
republican among the five senators under investigation 
mccain said the committees ranking republican warren rudman 
rnh had tried unsuccessfully to move the investigation along 
theres far more at stake than my reputation theres the 
reputation of the united states senate mccain said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan joined the criticism as 
did sens slade gorton rwash and john danforth rmo 
the senators noted that congress is less than a week from 
adjournment and six weeks have passed since committee special 
counsel robert s bennett recommended that mccain and sen john 
glenn dohio be dropped from the probe 
bennett proposed continuing the investigation against democratic 
sens alan cranston of california donald w riegle jr of michigan 
and dennis deconcini of arizona 
heflin said in a floor speech that there had been an organized 
campaign of leaks that harmed three of the democrats under 
investigation 
documents before the committee obtained by the associated press 
and others have shown that cranston deconcini and riegle had 
closer relationships with keating than they have publicly 
acknowledged 
it is interesting to note that the leak of documents has been 
confined to three senators and that there has been no leak of 
documents about the other two senators heflin said in a floor 
speech 
heflin added that in addition to bennetts recommendations the 
committee should study an oct 1 statement by common cause urging 
that no senator be dropped from the probe at this time 
he added that the committee would meet tuesday 
dole said there are rumors the committee doesnt want to make a 
decision because of politics it seems the failure to act would 
lead to the same conclusion its not a partisan committee 
judgments never have been considered in a partisan way on the 
senate floor we want to keep it that way two of our colleagues 
have sort of been hung up to dry he said 
the five senators intervened for keating with banking regulators 
and also received 13 million in political contributions from the 
businessman and his associates 
keatings lincoln savings and loan was seized by the government 
in april 1989 it may cost taxpayers more than 2 billion to cover 
the losses 
common cause the congressional watchdog group requested the 
investigation a year ago and the preliminary probe began last 
december

the missouri supreme court on monday 
threw an ethics amendment off the nov 6 ballot opponents argued 
it was unconstitutional because it covered too many subjects 
in a oneparagraph ruling the court upheld a judges decision 
to take amendment 5 off the ballot 
the judges offered no immediate comment saying they would issue 
a written opinion later amendment backers could seek a rehearing 
but there apparently are no other routes for state appeals 
amendment 5 would create a state ethics commission it also 
would reduce the 163member house to 103 members by 2003 shorten 
legislative sessions and appropriate money for ethics commission 
operations ahead of other spending 
democrats contend the measure is an attempt by republican gov 
john ashcroft a major financial backer of amendment 5 to reduce 
legislative strength 
no other governor in recent memory democrat or republican 
has undertaken such a blatant campaign against the elected members 
of the senate and house under the guise of ethics luckily the 
missouri supreme court has seen through his duplicity said 
senate president pro tem james mathewson a democrat 
ashcroft had no immediate comment 
the courts decision issued 15 days before the election was 
distributed to reporters within 90 minutes after it concluded a 
hearing appealing cole county circuit judge james mchenrys order 
attorney john bardgett sr representing amendment opponents 
told the states highest court that amendment 5 unconstitutionally 
deals with too many subjects it placed voters in the confusing 
position of voting for ethics while reducing their legislative 
representation he said 
do you think people ought to have to swallow one to get the 
other asked bardgett the courts former chief justice

the office of thrift supervision said today it 
will seek 308 million in restitution from david l paul the 
former chairman of the failed centrust bank of miami 
ots officials told a news conference it was the secondlargest 
amount they are seeking in a savings and loan case 
they said pauls insatiable vanity and greed were a major 
factor in the failure of centrust which will cost taxpayers an 
estimated 17 billion 
the thrift agency said it is serving paul with an order 
demanding restitution to centrust and barring him from selling or 
transferring any assets of more than 5000 
the ots also is seeking an order that would prohibit paul from 
working for any savings and loan 
the regulators are seeking the return of 15 million from a 
legal defense fund set up by centrust to pay legal fees in lawsuits 
filed against paul and other directors 
the 308 million also includes 49 million from a special 
retirement plan created mainly for paul the assets of the plan 
were transferred out of the country and managed by edward dg 
davies a british financier and former director of centrust 
the ots officials said paul will have until nov 1 to pay the 
money or to post bond in that amount however they said they do 
not know his whereabouts 
we believe he still has a residence in miami florida said 
faith hochberg a senior deputy chief counsel of ots she said the 
order will be sent to that address 
there is speculation that paul is currently in israel 
if paul does not answer the request the regulators said they 
will go to federal court in miami to compel him to do so 
the largest amount sought by federal regulators in an sampl case 
was 40 million from charles keating jr

the world health organization said monday that 
tests on four continents show weekly hormone injections for men 
could be a more effective birth control method than the pill 
the agency said the technique used a hormone preparation 
testosterone enanthate that is already in use for other purposes 
it halts sperm production 
the who said the research involved 271 men of whom 157 received 
weekly injections of the hormone their partners stopped using any 
other form of contraception for a year 
there was only one pregnancy during 1486 months of exposure 
an extremely high contraceptive efficacy comparable to that of 
female injectable contraceptives better than that of oral 
contraceptives and intrauterine devices and substantially better 
than that of condoms the who said 
the tests were conducted in seven countries australia china 
finland france sweden britain and the united states 
the who said there were few side effects directly attributable 
to the hormone but did not elaborate 
it said a number of volunteers withdrew from the project because 
they found it impractical to get weekly injections 
whos fourcontinent trial devised to examine a hormonal 
antifertility technique in men has produced a major breakthrough 
a who statement said 
more practical ways of dispensing the hormone perhaps requiring 
only three injections a year are being developed who said

president bush and congress are about to turn 
economic wisdom on its head with a plan to raise taxes and slash 
spending with the nation seemingly on the verge of a recession 
yet despite occasional jeers from supplyside disciples in 
congress many economic experts say its precisely the right thing 
to do 
under normal conditions you dont want to be cutting back on 
government demand at the same time that private demand is dropping 
in a recession because that gives a double whammy to the economy 
said david wyss chief financial economist for drimcgraw hill inc 
but when things are this far out of kilter the benefits of 
solving the underlying structural problem outweigh the shortterm 
damage he said 
economists are afraid rising government borrowing needs will 
push us interest rates higher and make it difficult for american 
companies to finance the modernization needed to compete in a world 
economy 
the emerging budget deal in congress would cut spending 
throughout the government raise income taxes on the wealthy and 
increase the federal gasoline tax all contrary to the traditional 
economic theory that says spending should be increased and taxes 
cut during slow times in the hope of stimulating the economy 
critics of the deal are warning it will turn george bush into 
herbert hoover another republican president who preached the need 
for budgetary prudence as a response to an economic downturn 
but a large number of private economists believe congress and 
the president are doing the right thing in putting together a 
program to trim the federal deficit by 500 billion over the next 
five years although they admit it goes against the economic gospel 
as preached by john maynard keynes 
keynesian economics holds that the government through its 
spending and taxing policies should stimulate the economy when its 
weak and restrain it when its strong 
supporters of the deficit program make these arguments 
while the combination of tax increases and spending cuts will 
remove purchasing power from the economy at a critical time the 
federal reserve has promised to offset those adverse impacts by 
lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity 
in addition the impact of the deficitcutting package is 
relatively small in the immediate future it calls for a small down 
payment of only 40 billion in deficitcutting medicine in the 
current fiscal year at a time when the economy is expected to be 
weakest 
the really big tax and spending changes wont begin to bite 
until later years when the economy will supposedly be in better 
shape because of the feds efforts to push interest rates lower 
harvard economist martin feldstein whose arguments for tax 
increases got him into hot water during his days as head of 
president reagans council of economic advisers is one of many 
economists supporting the deficit reduction package 
to the extent that it is contractionary it is fairly easy for 
the fed to offset that and the longer term results of the package 
will be expansionary feldstein said 
many economists said they believed the 40 billion in deficit 
cuts called for in the first year was about the right size large 
enough to be credible but not so large that it would too seriously 
dampen a 5 trillion economy 
however there is debate on that point some analysts contend 
that the recession they believe is imminent will be made worse by 
the deficit package 
the simple fact is that congress and the administration waited 
too long to get serious about deficit cutting said david jones 
chief economist of aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer i think it is incorrect to think that interest rates will 
fall far enough to offset the negative effects of raising taxes and 
cutting spending that are in the plan 
jones said he believes a recession the first one in eight 
years started in august and could last for up to 18 months 
the trouble bush has had selling the deficitcutting package to 
house republicans reflects a belief among supplyside enthusiasts 
that tax cuts not tax increases are what an ailing economy needs 
the deficit cutters have a simplistic notion that if the 
medicine doesnt taste good then just swallow hard and you will 
feel better in the morning i dont think that is true said john 
makin an economist with the conservative american enterprise 
institute 
but other economists argue that economic peril lies in 
continuing to ignore the string of budget deficits next years 
deficit is expected to total nearly 300 billion without any 
changes 
they contend this legacy of debt has driven us interest rates 
higher increased the countrys dependency on foreign capital and 
curtailed the critical investments america needs to boost 
productivity 
we need more deficit reduction not less said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co it is not so much for us but 
for our kids and their potential standard of living that this is so 
important

for 6 and a pack of cigarettes saddam husseins troops looked 
the other way as ruthie schaeffers husband a kuwaiti air force 
major joined a 100car convoy in slipping into iran from iraq 
my heart was beating out of my chest when they looked at my 
identification papers all fake the 12year military veteran 
said monday in a telephone interview from tehran iran i tried 
to say anything nice 
so to an iraqi soldier kazem stammered you are heroes 
and the iraqi he looked at me he said do you really believe 
we are heroes 
and i said yes i believe you are i gave him some 
chocolate he took it and then said we are not then he let me 
go 
the father of three who asked that his last name be withheld to 
protect family still in kuwait plans to join his american wife and 
children in germantown tenn after securing a new passport later 
this week 
when i left i really felt i would never see him again he was 
torn between his country and his children said ruthie schaeffer 
who fled kuwait with her young children about a month after iraqs 
aug 2 invasion 
i had very little hope that hed get out alive she said 
but after all the waiting waiting day by day its over were 
going to start over 
an estimated 1000 us citizens are still trapped in iraq and 
kuwait their relatives remain hostages of saddam who on monday 
reportedly said he would release some elderly and sick americans 
for kazem the prospect of leaving kuwait was wrenching 
returning to the united states meant a reunion with his wife and 
children but for a career military officer and patriot it also 
was a personal admission of defeat 
i did not want to go if i leave the country and my friends in 
the military leave whos going to fight the iraqis kazem said 
but we were like animals hunted and with no where to hide 
the decision to leave finally was made for kazem my uncle 
said i was endangering my family he said the iraqis were 
looking for me 
so at dawn on oct 8 kazem took a set of false iranian 
identification and joined a caravan at a highway outside kuwait 
city for a sevenhour journey through iraq and into iran 
kazem said monday that hed learned through friends that iraqi 
officials last week put an end to the daily convoys which were led 
by iranian embassy officials ostensibly bringing their own citizens 
home 
there were at least a hundred cars in front of me and many 
more behind kazem said when i got to the border i saw some 
friends there they were hugging and kissing me theyd heard two 
days before that i had been killed 
kazem who never stayed in once place longer than 12 hours said 
at least three of his relatives many of whom are in the military 
have been murdered by iraqi troops and many many of my 
friends my best friends in the military he said 
the iraqis they are looking in all the houses pulling out 
nails cutting ears burning with their cigarettes kazem said 
we in the military have to leave what else to do 
we fought we did our best but there are about 400000 iraqi 
soldiers and we are what between 20000 to 30000 we are a small 
country a peaceful country weve never had to fight before

a kuwaiti newspaper reported that saddam 
hussein dreamed the prophet mohammed appeared before him and told 
the iraqi president his countrys missiles were pointed in the 
wrong direction 
reports on the dream that circulated in international financial 
circles are said to have accounted in part for the largest oneday 
drop ever on new york markets of oil prices a fall of 541 a 
barrel to 2838 oil prices plunged 565 a barrel to close at 
2675 in london 
saddam is said to have told an audience of top aides who 
murmured god be blessed how mohammed appeared before him 
swathed in white robes the newspaper alseyassah said sunday 
the prophet mohammed visited me in my sleep all dressed in 
pure white but appearing concerned about something alseyassah 
said 
it quoted saddam as relating 
o prophet of the lord i told him what is it you require 
of me and he replied ive come saddam to call your attention 
to a big mistake 
what is it o prophet i asked and he said i see your 
rockets deployed wrongly 
iraqi missiles have been reported to be pointing south toward 
the hundreds of thousands of western forces massed in and around 
saudi arabia which abuts the kuwaiti border 
how i asked and he replied they are not pointed in the 
right direction the paper said of saddams purported remarks 
what is the direction you want o prophet of the lord i 
asked and he replied you know the direction and you should 
correct it 
saddam then reportedly said suddenly the prophet disappeared 
and it seems he only came to make that remark 
alseyassah whose report could not be independently confirmed 
is an arm of the ousted government of kuwait and has been active 
in trying to discredit saddam 
alseyassah is published in saudi arabia where the kuwaiti 
government fled after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
alseyassah said the story was being spread around iraqs 
capital of baghdad by iraqi intelligence in an apparent attempt to 
prepare iraqis psychologically for a pullout from kuwait 
there have been unconfirmed reports in recent days that iraqi 
troops were being pulled from major parts of kuwait and amassing 
around a fenced area that surrounds two northern persian gulf 
islands and an oilfield that saddam covets

a teenage defendant disrupted the second 
central park jogger rape and attempted murder trial monday when he 
began sobbing and yelling that the prosecutor was lying 
no no no i cant deal with this kharey wise 18 cried 
when assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer finished her 
opening statement 
wise then bent forward and vomited next to the defense table 
as court officers led him out of the courtroom wise screamed 
i cant take this it isnt true shes lying shes lying 
wise is one of two teenagers on trial in connection with the 
gang rape and savage beating of a woman who was attacked during her 
nightly run and left for dead in central park in an earlier trial 
three youths were convicted of rape and assault but acquitted of 
attempted murder 
howard diller attorney for codefendant kevin richardson 16 
asked acting justice thomas galligan for a mistrial or a separate 
trial for his client diller said wise had become stressed out 
and was foaming at the mouth 
the judge denied the motion noting that the outburst occurred 
just after he called a break in the session and the jurors had left 
the courtroom 
galligan warned wise he would be removed from the courtroom if 
he disrupted the trial again 
shortly before lederer finished her opening remarks wise had 
rocked in his seat talked to himself and held his hands to his 
face he bit his lip and pounded his forehead with his fist 
lederer said wise and richardson were among 30 youths who went 
into central park the night of april 19 1989 to beat to rob 
to assault to attack anyone they found in the park 
she said the defendants guilt will be proved by the testimony 
of bicyclists joggers police officers medical and scientific 
experts and by their own written and videotaped statements 
she said richardson described in a videotaped statement how he 
and the other youths hid in the dark and attacked the jogger when 
she ran past 
the prosecutor said richardson describes how they ripped the 
joggers shirt off how she screamed for help and how she scratched 
richardsons face 
he tells how everyone was feeling her how they took her pants 
off and raped her lederer said 
she said wise made two videotaped statements because he 
admittedly lied in the first one 
in the second tape he describes how he held the victims leg 
and fondled it while others raped her 
diller who began his opening remarks immediately after the 
15minute break told the jury that police put words in his 
clients mouth he suggested that richardson confessed to things he 
did not do that he was tricked 
wises lawyer colin moore told the jury in his opening that 
the prosecutions case was an optical illusion a conjurers 
trick done with smoke and mirrors 
he said the prosecutor was promising more than she can deliver 
i want you to compare the preview with the actual thing he 
said 
wise and richardson are among six teenagers who were charged in 
connection with the attack on the female jogger and two male 
runners that night 
the first trial ended in fiveto10year sentences the maximum 
for juvenile offenders for yusef salaam raymond santana and 
antron mccray all 16 they were convicted of rape assault 
robbery and riot but acquitted of attempted murder and sodomy 
the sixth defendant steven lopez 16 will be tried separately 
on the charges early next year 
wise 16 at the time of the attacks faces adult penalties that 
could total up to 57 years in prison if he is convicted on all 
counts richardson 14 when he was arrested faces the same five to 
10 years as the three convicted in the first trial

iraqi military forces captured some of kuwaits 
cache of usmade hawk antiaircraft missiles and apparently are 
trying to learn how to use the weapons defense secretary dick 
cheney said monday 
a state department spokeswoman in washington said most of 
kuwaits hawk missiles were captured in iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
the united states had sold kuwait five hawk batteries and more 
than 150 hawk missiles the hawks are said to be superior to other 
antiaircraft weapons in the iraqi arsenal 
we dont know precisely how many they have we do know that 
the iraqis captured some hawk missiles that the kuwaitis previously 
acquired and they now have them cheney told journalists after 
meeting president francois mitterrand 
whether or not theyre able to make them function or not at 
this point we dont know he said 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said we assume 
that the iraqis are attempting to learn to use the hawk systems 
ms tutwiler said jordan had given assurances at the highest 
levels that it was providing no assistance to iraq in learning 
how to use the hawks we have no collateral information to 
dispute those assurances she said 
the washington post reported sunday that concerned us 
officials inquired after israeli reports appeared saying jordanian 
technicians were teaching iraqis how to use the missiles 
the post reported iraq brought the hawks back to baghdad where 
iraqi technicians were trying to learn how to use them 
many us and allied military aircraft in the gulf region have 
no ready means of protection against the hawks the newspaper cited 
us officials as saying 
cheney spoke to reporters after 45 minutes of talks with 
president francois mitterrand the talks completed cheneys 10day 
european tour which also included stops in london and moscow he 
headed back to washington late monday 
in an interview earlier monday with the french television 
network la cinq cheney said there is no particular calendar 
for the un sanctions against iraq to drive baghdads troops out 
of kuwait 
we believe that the sanctions are getting more and more 
effective he said theyre beginning to hve an impact on the 
economy and to have an impact on their military potential

a man accused of organizing a ring that 
smuggled illegal aliens across the niagara river from canada in 
small rubber rafts pleaded guilty monday to conspiracy 
the ring which smuggled mostly chinese aliens operated from 
the summer of 1988 until the end of that year when a raft sank in 
the icy river two bodies were recovered and two others are 
believed killed

the radiocassette recorder packed with 
explosives that blew up pan am flight 103 could have worked 
normally and the bomb would have been difficult to detect an 
explosives expert said monday 
anyone examining the toshiba twinspeed recorder would have seen 
nothing suspicious on the outside said alan faraday head of the 
forensic explosives laboratory at the royal armament research and 
development establishment 
he told a public inquiry into the dec 21 1988 terrorist 
bombing that killed 270 people there was no reason why the 
recorder should not work normally even with the device inside 
i am certain that if someone had seen it and turned it on it 
would have been insufficient to determine it had been modified 
he said 
passengers carrying cassette recorders or radios at british 
airports are routinely asked by security personnel to turn them on 
new security measures agreed on after the pan am disaster 
require security staff to make other checks but we cant go into 
that because of security a department of transport spokesman 
said on condition of anonymity 
asked by scotlands chief law officer lord advocate lord 
fraser if the device would have shown up on airport xray 
machines faraday said it would have taken an extremely good 
operator to spot it 
faraday said experiments showed only a small amount of explosive 
could be hidden in the player but that the cassette recorder would 
look like an ordinary machine without any external signs of a 
concealed bomb 
faraday said a number of items had been found in the wreckage 
that indicated a toshiba recorder had been used to hide the device 
he said examination of a luggage container from the jumbos 
wreckage showed the unique characteristics of a close 
detonation 
specimens taken from the wreckage showed evidence of two types 
of chemicals that are manufactured as colorless crystalized 
substances he said 
both chemicals are used in the semtex explosives made in 
czechoslovakia he said 
i dont know of any other explosives that are manufactured 
including these two ingredients other than the semtex range but 
there could be others he said 
before faraday gave evidence the presiding judge sheriff 
principal john mowat said it would be undesirable for faraday 
to be photographed or sketched while around the court 
the inquiry expected to last into the new year is focusing on 
the deaths of 259 people aboard the boeing 747 and 11 on the ground 
in lockerbie and ways to prevent a similar disaster 
scottish investigators have said they are investigating several 
radical palestinian groups but the inquiry is not considering 
criminal responsibility

winstonsalem nc ap a woman accused of giving arsenic to 
two husbands and a boyfriend went on trial monday for the 
boyfriends death but her attorney said it was yet another man who 
was responsible for the crimes 
the prosecutor told jurors that blanche taylor moore had forged 
a chain of overlapping relationships with men that led her to 
murder raymond reid a boyfriend with whom she had worked at a 
supermarket 
defense attorney mitchell mcentire insisted on the innocence of 
the 57yearold grocery clerk whom he described as a hardworking 
churchgoing mother 
her life has not been above sin sin has touched her life 
mcentire said but she is free of guilt in any crime for indeed 
she is not guilty 
mrs moore is being tried in forsyth county superior court on a 
charge of first degree murder in reids death she also has been 
charged with killing her first husband james n taylor and trying 
to kill her second husband the rev dwight moore those cases are 
being tried separately 
mcentire pinned the crimes on garvin thomas who apparently had 
an obsession from afar with mrs moore and could not bear the 
thought of another man having her 
the defense attorney said thomas signed a letter confessing to 
the three poisonings which took place over 15 years but died 
before the letter reached the alamance county jail where mrs 
moore was being held 
however mcentire said thomas had visited his office several 
weeks earlier he said your client didnt do these things i 
know your client is innocent the defense lawyer told the 
court 
in his opening arguments forsyth county district attorney 
warren sparrow described mrs moores tangled web of relationships

support abortion rights

family and has written to the church hierarchy explaining his

a letter from the minister of his church criticizing his 
persistent outspokenness for abortion 
the minister rev bruce scarbeary said he wanted to talk with 
avenson about abortion rights in view of your continued 
membership in the congregation

drafting into statutes the theology of any given church it leads 
to problems for people who dont believe that theology

entering jerusalem on monday to prevent clashes following the 
murders of three jews by a knifewielding arab 
a palestinian teenager was killed and 19 others were 
hospitalized with wounds suffered in clashes with israeli troops 
monday throughout the occupied west bank arab reports said 
despite the heightened security in jerusalem a palestinian 
stabbed a jew slightly injuring him police searched a nearby 
village for the assailant 
also monday an 18yearold palestinian died of wounds suffered 
in an august 1988 clash mohammed naim abu akar was known among 
palestinians as the living martyr for surviving on intravenous 
feedings after israeli bullets destroyed his intestines 
later police in downtown jerusalem arrested a 23yearold 
palestinian after he tried to stab one of the officers police 
spokesman aharon elchayani said israel television said the 
attacker came from the west bank in spite of the travel ban 
jews angered by sundays killings stoned arab cars and beat 
several arab pedestrians israel radio said it blamed members of 
the antiarab kach party saying they were bent on inciting 
trouble 
after the violence national police headquarters announced the 
ban on palestinians entering jerusalem would continue for at least 
a second day tuesday in view of the present tension in the 
city 
the blockade does not affect the 140000 palestinians living in 
jerusalem but does apply to thousands who come from the west bank 
and gaza strip to work in the city 
police spokesman ron yishayahu said that in addition to a 
massive deployment of police forces in jerusalem night patrols 
by police and paramilitary troops would be stepped up 
prime minister yitzhak shamir blamed the violence on a 
terrible atmosphere of incitement in the arab world following 
president saddam husseins aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
there is some kind of delusion that redemption will come from 
baghdad and that once and for all the arabs will get rid of the 
zionist satan shamir told reporters 
he said israel was prepared to take tougher steps to stop 
attacks adding the jewish state would surmount this wave of 
hostility and terrorism 
shortly after shamir spoke his rightwing coalition survived 
its second noconfidence motion since taking office june 11 the 
5351 vote with two abstentions was forced by leftwing parties 
angered by shamirs handling of the economy relations with the 
united states and soviet immigrants

moslems on the temple mount after they stoned jewish worshipers at 
the nearby western wall at least 19 palestinians were killed and

said the 19yearold man arrested for the sunday stabbings 
obviously had gone temporarily insane 
the president deplores the tragic killings of three israeli 
citizens said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater these 
killings make it all the more important that the cycle of violence 
be ended we urge all parties to act to reinforce peace and calm in 
the region 
the bush administration supported an oct 12 un security 
council resolution condemning israeli police for the slayings and 
authorizing secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to send 
investigators to the city

attacked a jewish man delivering meat to a supermarket in a jewish

the head of a museum that displayed photographs by 
robert mapplethorpe says politics is the reason why the hea of the 
national endowment for the arts rejected a grant for another 
exhibit there 
a week ago i would have said no but now i would say that 
maybe there is an informal blacklist said david a ross 
director of the institute of contemporary art 
the institute drew protests this summer with the mapplethorpe 
show in cincinnati a gallery and its director were acquitted of 
obscenity charges after showing the same photos 
nea chairman john e frohnmayer told ross he was rejecting a 
40000 grant to fund an exhibit by los angeles mixedmedia artist 
mike kelley the grant had been approved by an nea selection panel 
it is almost unprecedented in the history of the nea that an 
application for a gallery is approved by a peer review panel and 
then gets rejected by the director said arthur cohen the 
institutes marketing director 
an nea spokeswoman denied that 
its not unusual for grants to be rejected at any level 
because of lastminute information or whatever said spokeswoman 
virginia falck 
falck said nea policy prevented the organization from saying why 
it rejected the grant out of consideration of the artists 
privacy 
we get 18000 applications a year and we have money for only 
about 4000 she said 
ross however cried foul 
i see this action as an insult to the peer review system and 
to the artist as well as integrity of the institute he said i 
am both saddened and angered by it 
we will do the show no matter what ross said 
traditionally nea grants are recommended by a peer panel and 
referred to the national council on the arts the agencys 
26member advisory board but the chairman has the authority to 
approve or deny grants on his own 
a late afternoon statement by the nea said the council rejected 
the application in may and frohnmayer accepted that 
recommendation but didnt tell the boston museum because of a 
clerical error 
owing to an administrative oversight the institute for 
contemporary arts in boston was not notified the nea said the 
art endowment deeply regrets the error it always is our intention 
to notify rejected grantees as soon as possible so that they can go 
on with their business 
before the statement was issued ross said it appears that a 
fully political decision was made to reject this grant because the 
work may be considered controversial to some it deals with any 
number of aspects of the dissolution of american society on a 
social and psychological level kelley deals with great humor and 
great wit and with great force and darkness as well 
kelleys work includes pen and ink drawings painting film and 
other mediums such as arranging stuffed animals in a room to 
appear as though they are having conversations 
cohen said the only piece of kelleys art that people might 
consider offensive was a cartoonish drawing of a man defecating 
kelleys drawings also include depictions of disembodied sexual 
organs 
ross said kelleys work is part of several museums permanent 
collections including the hirschhorn museum in washington new 
yorks museum of modern art and the museum of fine arts in boston 
the nea controversy began last year when sen jesse helms 
rnc and other conservatives in congress objected to nea funding 
of works they considered obscene 
helms singled out the mapplethorpe exhibit the perfect 
moment for its sexually graphic photographs and nude children 
last week a house compromise that would have allowed the nea to 
award grants without content restrictions was derailed by the 
senate appropriations committee which reinstituted an 
antiobscenity pledge that artists must sign before they receive 
grant money 
the kelley exhibit is scheduled to be shown in boston in october 
1992 and tour other museums across the nation and in europe

former dictator jose efrain rios montt 
himself banned from running was said monday to have accused 
president vinicio cerezo of planning to fix nov 11 elections to 
favor his christian democratic party 
the newspaper prensa libre said the retired general leveled the 
charge at a political rally last weekend in chiquimula 104 miles 
east of guatemala city 
it quoted rios montt as saying cerezo plans to stack the 
balloting in favor of alfonso cabrera hidalgo the presidential 
nominee of cerezos centrist christian democrats rios montt 
offered no evidence the paper said 
king vinicio and his court are preparing the throne for prince 
cabrera because they think we are still 450 years back and they 
are trying to manipulate the law rios montt was quoted as 
saying 
he urged his supporters to write his name on ballots to show 
that it is you who want me in power by law this would 
automatically invalidate the ballot enough invalid ballots could 
scuttle next months election 
rios montt also said he was robbed of victory when he ran for 
president on the christian democratic ticket in 1974 he said the 
election was fixed to put conservative gen eugenio kjell laugerud 
in power 
there was no immediate response from cerezo or the christian 
democrats 
rios montt was prohibited from running in next months election 
because he became president as a result of a military coup 7 years 
ago 
cerezo completes his fiveyear term jan 14 the first civilian 
elected president in 17 years in a country convulsed by a leftist 
guerrilla insurrection the past three decades all the rest have 
been rightist military men 
a bornagain protestant rios montt headed a military junta that 
overthrew president fernando romeo lucas garcia an elected army 
general in march 1982 
three months later he forced out the juntas two other officers 
and stayed on as president until the military forced him out in 
august 1983 
while in power he cracked down on crime and the guerrillas he 
had more than a dozen suspected rebel leaders summarily executed by 
firing squad 
until banned under provisions of a constitutional reform enacted 
by cerezo rios montt was a frontrunning candidate who advocated a 
war on crime he was the nominee of a threeparty rightist 
coalition 
public opinion polls indicated he appealed most to middleclass 
people fed up with a crime wave that has been sweeping guatemala 
the past three years 
efforts to negotiate an end to the leftist insurrection plan 
have failed so far human rights organizations estimate more than 
100000 people have been killed since the early 1960s 
rebel leaders say they back none of the 12 presidential 
candidates but are meeting in mexico with representatives of 
guatemalan political parties labor unions and other popular 
groups

the city suspended a finance inspector and his boss 
for illegally wiretapping municipal officials during investigations 
into alleged fraud officials announced monday 
assistant mayor jean tiberi said the pair had been removed from 
their workplaces following an internal probe sparked by a newspaper 
report of the illegal wiretaps 
the weekly le canard enchaine reported last week that wiretaps 
had been conducted by paris general inspection department without 
required court authorization 
mayor jacques chirac ordered an immediate investigation into the 
department which is assigned to police against financial 
irregularities in the city government 
tiberi reported the wiretaps stemmed from individual 
initiative during a probe into alleged fraud into the city 
department dealing with the restaurant industry 
the squad investigating the wiretaps found a tiny transmitter 
the size of a matchbox in the telephone of maurice guilmault chief 
of the restaurant department tiberi said 
the agent hubert rosenzweig and his superior guy legris who 
was apparently unaware of the operation have been suspended from 
their duties tiberi said 
no other wiretaps appear to have been planted tiberi said 
tiberi added that the probe into the restaurant department would 
continue and that an official report will be made public 
the case follows two other recent wiretapping controversies in 
one the chief executive and several employees of the century 
surveillance company were charged with illegal wiretapping 
in the other questions have been raised about police wiretaps 
of a maverick pastor joseph douce who has been missing since 
july he was under surveillance by officers suspicious of his 
associations with homosexuals 
the national government is considering possible changes in its 
wiretapping law the existing law requiring a judges consent is 
believed to be widely defied both by government agencies and 
private firms

at least 46 children have died over the last 
eight years when they were struck by closing automatic garage 
doors government safety experts said monday 
they urged homeowners to replace doors without automatic 
reverse the children were killed when garage doors did not reverse 
automatically the consumer product safety commission said 
the agency urged homeowners to help save childrens lives by 
checking garage door openers and to have them repaired or replaced 
immediately if they fail to reverse after striking an object 
many garagedoor units manufactured before 1982 do not have 
automatic reverse 
some older door openers are euipped with a device that only 
stops the closing door and does not reverse it when it strikes an 
object the commission said 
some of the older doors doors may have a device intended to 
cause the closing door to reverse but because of wear poor 
maintenance or a bad installation may not be safe enough to 
prevent child deaths the commission said 
it said these doorclosing devices cannot be adjusted or 
repaired to provide the safety available in garage door openers 
produced in 1982 and after 
homeowners concerned about their doors can safety by placing a 
twoinch wooden block in the path of the door the commission said 
if the door does not promptly reverse on striking the block the 
unit should be disengaged and a service technician called to see if 
repairs are needed it added 
it said the old garage door should be replaced if it does not 
have a working automatic reverse 
the commission advised that additional safeguards now are 
available to protect children 
it said closing units made after 1982 can be improved with an 
electric eye near the floor to reverse a closing garage door 
automatically whenever an object crosses the path of the door 
it also advised homeowners to relocate wall switches out of the 
reach of young children and to keep remote control units in the 
glove compartment of the car

coach joe gibbs wouldnt mind trading some 
of the long drives the washington redskins have gotten so good at 
for a few more points on the scoreboard 
the redskins 137 victory over philadelphia on sunday 
highlighted the nagging trouble washington has had getting the ball 
in the end zone this season 
if you put teams on the 20 every week theyre going to have a 
tough time getting it in against anybody gibbs said monday the 
eagles had a hard time getting it in against us and we had a 
tough time against them 
thats what happens when you dont score from outside on long 
plays he said 
we hurt ourselves in scoring opportunities because we had some 
key third down shots down around the 30 that hurt us gibbs said 
we missed a blitz read and dropped two balls in there that cost 
us big plays 
the redskins moved deep into philadelphia territory on their 
first six possessions in sundays game but they stalled on all but 
one of the drives and had just a 70 lead to show for the effort 
their first two drives got to the eagles 31 but earnest byner 
lost two on a 3rdand1 play on the first possession and 
quarterback stan humphries tossed a pass into the hands of safety 
wes hopkins who dropped it on 3rdand3 the next time and the 
redskins got no points 
finishing drives has been one of their problems in close games 
this year throw out their 3810 rout of the cardinals porous 
defense and the redskins had scored three touchdowns the eight 
times they have gotten inside the 20 
their lone td sunday a 1yard plunge by gerald riggs was set 
up by a big play art monks diving reception inside the 1 for a 
44yard gain 
normally against philadelphia you expect to hit a couple of 
big plays we just hit one gibbs said 
their lack of a finishing touch was magnified against the eagles 
by four missed field goals by chip lohmiller the kicker is now 10 
of 12 on attempts inside the 40 and 2 of 7 from beyond the 40 
humphries drove the redskins back to within sight of the goal 
posts in the fourth quarter and lohmiller connected from 33 and 39 
yards for the final winning margin 
we do not want to do something stupid like turn the ball 
over near the end zone gibbs said were getting our shots 
when you miss field goals it hurts you dramatically against good 
football teams 
the offense has had to adjust to a second quarterback after mark 
rypien went down with a knee injury in the third week humphries 
three starts since then are his first in the nfl 
humphries was 14of31 for 200 yards against philadelphia and 
has thrown two tds in his three starts 
stan made some very good plays gibbs said there were 
also several times there when he got balls in their hands theres 
good news and bad news there there were three balls we could have 
gotten in trouble with 
meanwhile defensive end markus kochs sprained left knee was 
examined by doctors on monday and coaches said it was doubtful he

president elias hrawis government worked 
on plans monday to disarm gunmen in christian and moslem militias 
who are involved in the 15yearold civil war and to gain the 
release of western hostages held by moslem extremists 
prime minister salim hoss branded as interference in lebanons 
domestic affairs a french request that the five permanent members 
of the un security council convene to discuss the lebanese 
conflicts 
he said he communicated this official position to the five 
permanent members france the united states the soviet union 
china and britain 
frances request was announced monday by french foreign minister 
roland dumas france considers itself the protector of lebanons 
christians who supported frances mandate from 192043 in lebanon 
dumas said the assassination of christian leader dany chamoun 
with his wife and two small sons at their home east of beirut on 
sunday shows the extent of the horrors of lebanons civil 
strife 
leaders of frances rightwing opposition have held syria 
reponsible for the killings that followed the ending of gen michel 
aouns mutiny on oct 13 
aoun who operated from an enclave in the christian heartland 
has taken refuge in the french embassy after being driven out by 
hrawis troops and the syrian army 
the only issue lebanon wants the security council to discuss 
is israels occupation of the border enclave in south lebanon and 
the implementation of resolution 425 calling on israel to 
withdraw hoss said 
we are in the process to preparing a demand for the 
application of un sanctions against israel for refusing to pull 
out 
hoss issued his statement after returning from daylong talks in 
damascus with syrian leaders to speed up reunification of beirut 
now that aoun the major foe of an arab leaguebrokered peace plan 
has been removed 
a hrawi aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
president himself returned from the syrian capital sunday night 
with plans to disband the militias and gain the hostages release 
hours before gunmen had killed chamoun younger son of the late 
president camille chamoun and his family 
the christian area staged a daylong strike monday to protest the 
slayings chamoun was a key supporter of aoun 
aoun had opposed the peace pact because it did not guarantee 
complete withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops in lebanon since 1976 
in new york the council of lebaneseamerican organizations 
asked the security council to convene an emergency session to move 
a battalion of un peackeeping forces from southern lebanon to 
christian areas to halt purported violence by syrians and militias 
the hrawi aide said filling the security vacuum in areas 
formerly held by aoun is the governments no 1 priority 
the official syrian arab news agency reported monday the 
lebanese army will now assume security tasks in aouns former 
areas 
prosyrian groups blamed the chamoun killings on christian 
warlord samir geagea whose lebanese forces militia fought 
unsuccessfully with aouns troops for mastery of the christian 
heartland this year 
geagea denied involvement he joined other christian and moslem 
leaders in urging hrawis government to bring peace to the area 
that had been controlled by aouns forces 
hrawi told syrias state television network over the weekend 
that all militias will be disbanded by peaceful means but well 
use other means if we face objections i warn everybody that no 
opposition by the gun or the cannon will be tolerated 
a dozen major militias are blamed for most of the 150000 deaths 
in the civil war 
the hrawi aide said among the areas to be cleared of fighters 
are the south beirut slums stronghold of the fundamentalist shiite 
moslem hezbollah or party of god 
hezbollah is the umbrella for proiranian extremists holding 
most of the 13 missing westerners including six americans longest 
held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press who was abducted march 16 1985 
hrawis aide said the syrians will discuss plans to move into 
the slums with iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati when he 
visits damascus later this week 
this will definitely include the fate of the western hostages 
whether theyre held in the slums or have been smuggled out to the 
bekaa valley a syriancontrolled area in eastern lebanon the 
aide added 
theres a syrianlebanese understanding that the hostage issue 
should be resolved in parallel with the creation of a greater 
beirut

an iraqi vessel apparently dumped 
its cargo overboard rather than have it seized under unapproved 
economic sanctions us military officials said monday 
following a 48hour chase that included three rounds of warning 
shots sailors who boarded the vessel albahar alarabi in the gulf 
of oman on monday found no prohibited cargo a navy spokesman 
said 
on saturday in the persian gulf crews from the destroyer uss 
obrien reported the 5700ton iraqi ship was carrying steel pipe 
and plywood which are blocked by the embargo 
we dont know what happened to it and can only assume that it 
was dumped overboard sometime between the first boarding and the 
second boarding said cmdr jd van sickle a navy spokesman 
after the second inspection the ship was allowed to continue 
he said 
the ships captain who was not identified originally said his 
destination was aden yemen at the southern tip of the arabian 
peninsula yemen is among a handful of countries supporting iraqi 
president saddam husseins aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the embargo imposed two weeks after the invasion cover trade 
from iraq and en route to the nation 
the slowmoving vessel was first intercepted as it sailed 
southward toward the strait of hormuz linking the persian gulf and 
the gulf of oman 
the ships master agreed to return to iraq after the piping and 
plywood was discovered but the vessel resumed its course when the 
boarding party left the navy spokesman said 
the vessel refused orders to stop and the destroyer fired three 
volleys across its bow on sunday van sickle said the 7800ton 
destroyer fired its 5inch and 25millimeter deck guns and 
50caliber machine guns 
shadowed overnight by the italian frigate libeccio as it passed 
through the strait the iraqi ship stopped again when challenged in 
the gulf of oman by the american frigate uss reasoner and the 
australian missile frigate hmas adelaide van sickle said 
fifteen men from the adelaide and 11 from the reasoner were 
dispatched and thoroughly searched the ship and found no 
prohibited cargo van sickle said 
us officers said they did not know the iraqi captains reason 
for defying the order to return to iraq or divert to another port 
maybe it was because he knows what would happen to him if he 
did go back said one officer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the reasoner and adelaide have been operating in the gulf of 
oman and north arabian sea the past month as members of the 
multinational fleet enforcing the un embargo 
about 12 nations have sent ships to the region 
according to the us military more than 2500 commercial ships 
have been challenged 250 boarded and about a dozen diverted on 
grounds their cargo was iraqrelated 
us warships had a role in 191 of the boardings the british 
australian spanish and greek navies have also participated

nebraskas state treasurer was charged 
monday with theft by deception for allegedly misusing state phones 
the felony charge alleges treasurer frank marsh used a state 
credit card to make more than 300 worth of personal phone calls 
said lancaster county attorney mike heavican if convicted marsh 
could face up to five years in prison and a 10000 fine 
marsh a republican seeking a fourth term also was charged with 
a misdemeanor filed jointly by the prosecutor and the state 
accountability commission said heavican 
reached at his home monday marsh said he was unaware of the 
charges and declined to comment on them or on whether he would 
resign 
the democratic candidates for auditor and treasurer last month 
accused marsh of using state phones for personal calls 
the next day marsh reimbursed the state 1663 for calls he 
said might be in question and authorities began an investigation 
the voters in nebraska are due an apology for this mistake in 
judgment marsh said then 
he said many of the calls were businessrelated he said he made 
monthly estimates of his personal calls and offset the costs by 
using his own car for state business purchasing gasoline and 
stamps with his own money and buying miscellaneous office 
supplies however he kept no records of such reimbursement 
im glad that they were able to complete part of the 
investigation before the election said dawn rockey democratic 
candidate for treasurer 
its important for the voters to understand the gravity of the 
situation the voters will decide if the public trust has been 
violated she said 
john breslow democratic candidate for auditor joined with ms 
rockey in bringing up the issue and noted that an audit by 
republican ray ac johnson of the treasurers office did not find 
the questionable calls 
state republican party chairman norm riffel declined comment as 
did gov kay orr and attorney general robert spire both 
republicans 
the misdemeanor under the statutes of the state political 
accountability and disclosure commission deals with a specific 
phone call made for his own personal gain heavican said it is 
punishable by up to three months in jail and a 500 fine 
i think its safe to say there are further investigatory 
things to be done but i dont want to speculate further on that 
heavican said in response to a question of possible further 
charges 
marsh 66 has said that if reelected in november it will be 
his last term the former secretary of state and lieutenant 
governor was first elected treasurer in 1975 he served until 1981 
when he resigned to become state director of the farmers home 
administration then was elected treasurer again in 1986

prime minister krishna prasad bhattarai 
on monday said the government has accepted certain changes 
proposed by king birendra in this kingdoms constitution 
but the prime minister refused to say if the concessions 
included birendras key demand that the monarchy share sovereignty 
with the people and retain emergency powers 
the cabinet has acceded to certain changes suggested by the 
palace but all other clauses in the draft constitution would be 
kept intact bhattarai told reporters before he entered the 
palace to present the draft constitution 
birendra earlier rejected a draft constitution approved by 
bhattarais cabinet that seeks to make him a constitutional 
monarch 
instead he submitted amendments prompting bhattarai to say he 
would rather resign than accept the kings draft which he said 
were against his political and moral beliefs 
asked if he had changed his mind about resigning bhattarai said 
not so far indicating the cabinets changes did not include 
birendras main demands 
the king had bowed to prodemocracy demonstrations and yielded 
his absolute power last april after a mass peoples uprising and a 
subsequent police crackdown that left at least 200 people dead 
i am going to the palace to request the king to accept the 
draft constitution submitted by the government bhattarai said 
after a threehour cabinet meeting he refused to elaborate 
we will inform you when the time comes he said 
but health minister mathura prasad shrestha described the kings 
draft as illegal saying we will accept only certain changes 
provided they are not against the fundamental spirit of the 
constitution 
earlier monday the palace issued a statement that it had no 
knowledge of the prime minister having any wish to resign it 
said the king would deal with all issues of national importance 
with the advice and knowledge of the prime minister 
the official gorkhapatra newspaper repoted monday that 
bhattarai has informed the kings chief secretary rebati raman 
khanal that he could not have the kings draft approved by the 
cabinet or by his nepali congress party therefore it had no 
chance of being accepted by the people 
birendras amended draft would reserve the kings right to 
exercise emergency powers in case of threat to the countrys 
sovereignty economic distress failure of the constitutional 
organs or external threats to the country 
this is a serious point under which the king can stage a 
comeback under the smallest pretext said a nepali congress party 
official who did not want to be further identified 
party general secretary girija prasad koirala said the king 
should fulfil his historic responsibility by promulgating the 
constitution before the people waiting for a democratic 
constitution lose their patience

the african national congress 
recommended monday that nelson mandela meet rival black leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi a breakthrough that could help ease the 
violence in black townships 
the anc proposed a meeting between itself and buthelezis 
conservative inkatha freedom party in the near future but did 
not specify a date the anc statement said both mandela and 
buthelezi should attend 
buthelezi said he welcomed the offer and was ready to consider a 
suitable time and place for the talks 
mandela is in australia and will be traveling throughout asia 
until early november 
since his release from prison in february mandela has turned 
down invitations from his old friend buthelezi despite the ongoing 
violence between their supporters in the eastern province of natal 
and in black areas outside johannesburg 
anc leaders have harshly briticized buthelezi and accused him of 
orchestrating the violence to obtain a meeting with mandela and 
enhance his stature 
buthelezi has denied the charge and accused the anc of trying to 
destroy all rivals 
the anc was conciliatory in its statement monday 
the group said it welcomed the steps being taken jointly by 
the anc and the inkatha freedom party to stop the violence 
the two sides have been holding periodic peace talks but 
neither mandela nor buthelezi has attended 
about 5000 blacks have died in the ancinkatha power struggle 
since 1986 in natal province the fighting spread to the 
johannesburg area in august and has claimed 800 lives 
the anc and inkatha the two largest black opposition movements 
both oppose apartheid but differ over tactics and a future south 
africa 
the socialistoriented anc has employed boycotts strikes 
protests and waged an armed struggle recently suspended in its 
battle against the government 
inkatha does not endorse any of those measures and favors 
capitalism 
the anc draws support across tribal lines while virtually all 
inkatha members are zulus 
the anc also has opposed buthelezis role as leader of the 
kwazulu homeland in natal province the anc considers the 10 black 
homelands part of the apartheid system buthelezi meanwhile sees 
the limited selfgovernment in the homelands as an interim step on 
the road to black majority rule

henry amp june the sexually charged film 
that earned the first nc17 movie rating is generating vigorous 
business at the nations theaters 
henry amp june has been playing for three weeks in limited 
release last weekend it grossed 12 million in 212 movie houses 
exhibitor relations co inc said monday 
that placed it 12th on the boxoffice charts to date the 
universal pictures release has made 46 million a considerable 
return for a production not aimed at teenage audiences 
im very pleased said director philip kaufman when you 
make a film you have hopes there will be an audience for it 
there are not enough adult movies for people to see 
the film a story of a menage a trois that earned the new 
nochildren rating for a lesbian love scene and a shot of an erotic 
drawing is based on the diaries of writer anais nin starring fred 
ward uma thurman and maria de medeiros it was originally rated x 
kaufman said the ratings flap may have helped the film but 
maintained that wasnt solely responsible for its strong 
performance the film is promoted in some advertisements with the 
line completely uncut in its original version 
it obviously has good word of mouth and it got some good 
reviews kaufman said in a telephone interview from san 
francisco we might have had better reviews without the 
controversy some people say it isnt sexy enough 
kaufman noted that the recent spanish film tie me up tie me 
down originally was given the x rating too but didnt perform 
well at movie theaters so you cannot say the controversy worked 
for it he said 
kaufman and universal both felt henry amp june deserved the 
lessharsh r rating rather than the x originally given it by the 
motion picture association of america 
when the mpaa announced sept 26 that it would replace the x 
with nc17 which excludes children under 17 kaufman and universal 
canceled their appeal of henry amp junes x rating and accepted 
the new classification 
many newspapers and hundreds of television and radio stations 
reject advertisements for movies rated x filmmakers said that the 
x mark was synonymous with hardcore pornography and the nc17 was 
created to resolve that economic impasse 
henry amp june was pulled from one theater in dedham mass 
when two civic leaders protested its exhibition to the theater 
owner newspapers in sacramento and in birmingham ala have 
refused to run advertisements for nc17 rated films

the house voted monday to spend 522 billion 
on farming nutrition and rural development programs including a 
halfmillion dollars to renovate the former home of retired 
bandleader lawrence welk and build nearby tourist accommodations 
by voice vote the house accepted compromises worked out by a 
housesenate conference committee on the fiscal 1991 appropriations 
bill that pays for farm subsidies and most agriculture department 
functions as well as the food and drug administration 
among the 141 billion for rural development projects is 
500000 for strasburg nd the birthplace of lawrence welk 
thats right ah one ah two ah three ah four ah half a 
million dollars said rep silvio conte rmass mimicking the 
way welk used to direct his orchestra 
the money was included in the bill by the senate to help 
revitalize the 700population community in the south central part 
of the state but conte and rep richard durbin dill both 
conference committee members went on record as opposing the 
appropriation before signing the compromise bill 
its money is to be used by welk heritage inc and the strasburg 
economic development corp to renovate the welk family home and 
help build a motel and other facilities to accommodate the tourist 
trade that is beginning to develop around the bandleaders former 
residence 
many rural communities where farms have been consolidated over 
the years causing a loss of economic base are looking to the 
government for help to develop other businesses 
about half the money in the bill 276 billion goes for food 
programs including 19 billion for food stamps and 25 billion 
for the women infant and children program said appropriations 
committee chairman jamie whitten dmiss 
food donations the special milk program and child nutrition 
programs also are covered by the bill 
the bill appropriates 5 billion for farm subsidies this year 
and continues the crop insurance program which whitten had stripped 
from the original house bill 
since 1980 the crop insurance program has lost over 26 
billion in indemnity payments said whitten administration in 
the past 10 years increased over 2 billion an increase of over 
450 percent 
but at the urging of the senate he agreed to allow the program 
to continue under certain conditions including the agriculture 
departments agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
taking control over policy sales and loss adjustments 
the service had controlled the program before 1980 when it was 
expanded to allow private insurance companies to issue policies to 
farmers the practice became costly because the private companies 
were reimbursed by the government for administrative expenses and 
operating losses 
other specific agencies and their appropriations included 
farmers home administration 115 billion 
rural electrification administration 3346 million 
soil conservation service 7713 million

a renegade colonel who led a 1988 
barracks revolt was arrested monday for insubordination because of 
a letter he wrote to president carlos menem 
army chief gen martin bonnet sentenced former col momahed ali 
seineldin to 60 days at the fourth army corps base in la pampa 391 
miles southwest of buenos aires 
i cant give details seineldin said tonight i leave for 
la pampa 
the cause of his arrest was a 5page letter seineldin delivered 
saturday to the presidential compound at olivos a buenos aires 
suburb while menem was in europe on a state visit 
the letter said the state of unrest among officers and 
commissioned troops could lead to extremely dangerous 
incidents 
but military officials and politicians have discounted the 
possibility of another revolt like the three that occurred between 
april 1987 and december 1988 undermining the government of former 
president raul alfonsin menems predecessor 
seineldins letter instead was considered insubordination 
defense minister humberto romero said seineldins statements and 
arrest in no way can find an echo in the rest of that armed 
service 
vice president eduardo duhalde said it seems that certain 
sectors would take advantage of the absence of the president to 
take liberties 
he ordered bonnet give seineldin the harshest sanction 
applicable 60 days arrest for an officer who violates the 
military chain of command 
seineldin a 56yearold former commando led a hardline group 
within the army that opposed the trials of fellow officers for 
human rights abuses committed in the 197683 regimes crackdown on 
alleged leftist subversives 
at least 9000 argentines disappeared during the militarys 
dirty war against suspected subversives and are presumed dead 
during seineldins 4day uprising in december 1988 he demanded 
the army budget be increased and top generals replaced according 
to seineldin then army chief gen jose caridi agreed to the 
demands then reneged 
seineldin said he was prompted to write to menem because 
officers who agree with him are being denied promotion the army 
budget still is inadequate and the shakeup in the military 
hierarchy never took place 
i consider it a duty to tell the commanderinchief of the 
armed forces about something i believe is extremely dangerous for 
the future of the armed forces and the argentine nation he said 
in the letter 
seineldin and cashiered lt col aldo rico who led the first 
two uprisings in april 1987 and january 1988 both insist they are 
soldiers who want to return to uniform 
both have held public meetings and rallies this year in an 
apparent attempt to mobilize political dissent that stems from 
chronic economic problems and menems plan to sell moneylosing 
state enterprises many argentines consider the national patrimony 
rico is a minorparty candidate for governor of buenos aires 
province the countrys most populous in elections set for 
november 1991 
spokesmen for seineldin distributed the menem letter saturday to 
reporters and asked them to cover his probable arrest on monday

president bush vetoed a major civil rights 
bill monday and seemed assured of winning a battle in congress to 
override him bush argued that the bill before him would force 
employers to adopt hiring quotas a position disputed by backers of 
the measure 
the president called on lawmakers to enact his version of the 
measure before they quit for the year probably later this week 
however that appeared unlikely as bushs critics said his 
proposal would weaken current law 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the chief senate sponsor 
called the veto tragic and disgraceful 
when the chips are down the white house is against civil 
rights kennedy said he urged congress to override the 
president 
ralph g neas executive director of the leadership conference 
on civil rights said bushs veto will victimize his presidency 
forever he joins andrew johnson and ronald reagan as the only 
presidents to veto a civil rights bill 
the bill was passed by the senate 6234 and by the house 273154 
strong majorities but not reaching the twothirds required to 
override a veto 
rep augustus f hawkins dcalif the prime house sponsor 
said he would not even ask for an override vote without the 
twothirds needed by supporters im just not going to waste any 
more time hawkins said adding that civil rights forces might 
even lose support in an override fight 
in his veto message bush said the temptation to support a 
bill any bill simply because its title includes the words 
civil rights is very strong 
but when our efforts however wellintentioned result in 
quotas equal opportunity is not advanced but thwarted he said 
the very commitment to justice and equality that is offered as 
the reason why this bill should be signed requires me to veto it 
he said i deeply regret having to take this action with a 
bill bearing such a title especially since it contains certain 
provisions that i strongly endorse 
the measure would nullify six supreme court decisions that have 
made it more difficult for women and minorities to prove and win 
job discrimination suits it would ban racial harassment in the 
workplace and allow punitive damages in the most serious 
discrimination cases 
bush said there were many similarities between the bill he 
vetoed and the version that the administration supports offered at 
the last minute to ease the veto 
civil rights advocates denounced the latest version of bushs 
bill as a sham for permitting challenged hiring practices to stand 
if they could be justified on such grounds as customer 
relations justifications they said were used to support the 
separatebutequal jim crow laws of the first half of the 20th 
century that kept blacks in segregation 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights called bushs bill 
a tired rehash of policies considered and rejected by the 
congress we have nearly compromised this bill to death 
summing up his key argument bush said despite the use of the 
term civil rights in the title the bill actually employs a 
maze of highly legalistic language to introduce the destructive 
force of quotas into our nations employment system 
he said that under congress bill employers will be driven to 
adopt quotas in order to avoid liability 
bush said legal experts disagree over how to interpret important 
sections of the bill he said that was a sure sign that the vetoed 
bill would have led to years perhaps decades of uncertainly and 
expensive litigation 
ron brown democratic national chairman said the issue for 
the president isnt quotas its politics george bush got to the 
white house by pandering to fear today he chose willie horton 
over abraham lincoln horton was the convicted murderer featured 
prominently in bush campaign ads in 1988 
in a lastminute appeal black activist dick gregory marched in 
front of the white house on monday carrying a sign that read 
mr president before you veto the civil rights bill please 
think about the number of black african americans you have sent to 
the persian gulf willing to die for someone elses human rights 
the presidents spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier he 
believed congress could not override the veto 
there are a lot of members of congress who believe as we do 
that there can be a better bill fitzwater said i think 
everybody wants a good civil rights bill 
despite the odds favoring bush neas predicted a close override 
vote and said civil rights advocates would push through a bill 
early next year if they lose this time 
its only a matter of time he said the question is not 
if theres going to be a civil rights act but when 
arthur fletcher head of the civil rights commission said the 
panel disagreed with bushs stand 
tensions between the white house and civil rights supporters 
were reflected in the sharp language used by fitzwater against 
bushs critics 
i think they are being unfair fitzwater said a lot of 
them dont understand the legal implications of the bill 
fitzwater said the veto would not undermine bushs campaign to 
improve his standing among blacks 
i think they blacks understand that we want a good civil 
rights bill and they dont want a quota bill either he said 
fitzwater said bushs bill was very similar to the measure 
adopted by congress 
the only difference is that our bill does not include the 
language that we believe has the effect of forcing quotas he 
said 
a key dispute has been language that would help those filing 
discrimination suits and make it more difficult for employers to 
defend themselves bush says those provisions are so stringent that 
companies would adopt quotas to have a readymade defense an 
argument sponsors dispute 
under the supreme court decisions at issue a plaintiff had to 
prove that the hiring practices in dispute were not the result of 
business necessity the bill would shift that burden of proof to 
the defendant employer 
the white house plan would cap at 150000 the total damages an 
employee could win in a job discrimination suit as passed the 
bill would allow unlimited compensatory damages in some cases and 
cap punitive damages at 150000 or the total of compensatory 
damages plus back pay whichever is greater the white house 
previously had insisted on a 100000 cap 
the administration proposal also would allow those filing suit 
to press their cases if employers could not explain their hiring 
methods in legal terms

a special court refused monday to decide 
whether the delaware amp hudson railway has the right to run its own 
trains on a short stretch of conrail tracks between buffalo and 
niagara falls ny 
the judges denied conrails petition said richard eriksen 
clerk of the court they will explain their reasons when they 
issue their memorandum or opinion 
conrail immediately served the damph trustee with a demand for 
binding prbitration said laurence z shiekman a lawyer for 
conrail he said conrail would also assignment of trackage rights 
by a bankruptcy court next month 
the decision came only hours after lawyers for conrail argued 
that the special regional rail reorganization court has 
jurisdiction because the issue dates to 1976 when the federal 
government formed conrail the special court decides any cases 
arising out of that reorganization 
but a lawyer for the damphs bankruptcy trustee said the case 
should be decided in bankruptcy court because the trackage rights 
were conferred in a separate 1979 agreement 
the approximately 15mile stretch is key to a 25 million offer 
by canadian pacific ltd to buy the ailing damph without access to 
the buffaloniagara gateway cp would be unable to connect the damph 
with its own lines in southern ontario 
canadian pacific wants the damph system to connect philadelphia 
and new york with the canadian interior if cp can put all the 
pieces together it would compete directly with conrail for freight 
in the northeast 
the canadian company has been operating the damph since august 
under an order of the interstate commerce commission 
charles h white jr lawyer for the bankruptcy trustee pointed 
out that conrail chose not to object to the damph takeover in 
bankruptcy court or before the interstate commerce commission 
it is ironically using its own statutory court to throw grave 
doubt on the reorganization of its competitor white said i 
think we can see through the thin jurisdictional arguments exactly 
whats happening here 
chief judge john minor wisdom called the case troubling and 
asked both sides why they had never submitted the question to 
binding arbitration as required by both the 1976 and 1979 
agreements neither side had a clear answer 
the damph the nations oldest continually operated railroad 
filed in july 1988 for protection from its creditors under us 
bankruptcy laws the railroad which runs from montreal to 
washington and between albany and buffalo owes more than 100 
million 
this is the second time that conrail has thrown up a roadblock 
in cps effort to buy the damph earlier this year conrail refused 
to negotiate the rights to its tracks between hagerstown md and 
harrisburg pa this led cp to withdraw its initial 35 million bid 
for the damph

now is badly split and weakened 
party members joyfully paraded through the streets of downtown 
santiago as secretarygeneral volodia teitelboim delivered 61400 
supporting signatures to the election board a requirement for a 
political partys legal recognition 
but the party faces the gravest crisis in its 68 years of 
existence leading members have resigned unhappy with an oldguard 
leadership that they said failed to accept democratic changes 
for many years chilean communists were staunchly promoscow 
but local leaders did not go along as changes effected in the 
soviet union under mikhail s gorbachev spread through the world 
communist movement 
central committee member luis gustavino was expelled after he 
publicly attacked the partys lack of internal democracy 
prominent members resigned as did about 200 members of the youth 
branch

said it was not easy as the party lived for 17 years under 
ferocious repression 
under the 16year military regime of gen augusto pinochet 
which ended in march scores of party leaders were killed arrested 
or sent into exile 
the party was outlawed other leftist parties received similar 
treatment under pinochets successor president patricio aylwin 
restrictions have been lifted 
the communist party was a major member in the sixparty 
coalition supporting the leftist government of president salvador 
allende who died when pinochet toppled his administration in a 
bloody 1973 coup 
the communists were especially strong among workers and 
attracted up to 16 percent of the vote in national elections 
in last decembers congressional elections the party failed to 
elect one senator or congressman its total vote was estimated at 
25 percent 
teitelboim on monday described the crisis within the party as 
a process of deep renovation

sovereignty the united states has sought to avoid using its veto 
power as one of the five permanent council members empowered to 
kill any measure

prime minister vp singh on monday 
appealed for a peaceful resolution to a religious site dispute that 
has caused violent hindumoslem clashes and could threaten the 
singhs coalition government 
religious fanaticism is the first step towards the foundation 
for a theocratic state it will be the death of india as a secular 
state singh said during a 20minute televised speech 
at least 80 people have died this year in battles over a 16th 
century mosque the babri masjid in ayodhya about 310 miles east 
of new delhi 
hindus believe the town was the birthplace of a god rama and 
want to dismantle the mosque claiming it was built by mogul rulers 
on the foundations of an ancient hindu temple 
the hindu world council has vowed to start rebuilding the temple 
oct 30 but a moslem group had said it will protect the mosque 
hindus comprise 82 percent of indias 880 million people moslems 
account for 12 percent 
singh said he has appointed five state chief ministers to help 
solve the issue chief ministers are the highest elected 
officials of a state 
he also asked the hindu fundamentalist bharatiya janata party to 
work toward a nonviolent solution 
there was no immediate reaction from the bharatiya janata or 
indian peoples party several other political parties and groups 
have unsuccessfully appealed to the party to call off its campaign 
singhs 10monthold national front coalition government needs 
the bharatiya janata party and the left front a conglomeration of 
communist groups to remain intact 
the bharatiya janata party has threatened to withdraw support 
from the government if the proposed temple construction is 
disrupted 
how can a country be governed in circumstances like this is 
it necessary that the country has to be plunged into communal 
chaos cant they wait to build the temple until a peaceful 
settlement has been reached asked singh whose janata dal party 
comprises the largest part of the coalition government 
hundreds of governments can come and go but the nation should 
remain one he said government is too small a consideration 
when people are involved 
clashes between the moslems and hindus escalated last month 
after bharatiya janata party leader lal krishna advani set off on a 
6000mile van journey from a west indian hindu shrine to ayodhya 
advani is scheduled to reach ayodhya on oct 30 authorities in 
uttar pradesh state have said they may arrest advani when he 
crosses the state border 
fearing unrest police already have detained more than 20000 
hindu activists many road and rail links to ayodhya have been 
blocked or subject to stringent checks

congress took a first step monday to require 
colleges to tell prospective students how many athletes graduate 
and how much crime there is on campus as well as how many football 
titles and nobel prize winners it has 
by voice vote the house approved a bill requiring colleges and 
universities that receive federal financial aid and grant athletic 
scholarships to provide graduation data to the education 
department 
academic institutions receiving federal student aid also must 
disclose to students and employees campus security policies and 
crime statistics 
the bill was produced by a conference committee of the house and 
senate that ironed out differences in versions passed by each 
house the senate must approve before the bill can go to the 
president 
choosing which college or university to attend is a difficult 
decision for parents and students said rep pat williams 
dmont chairman of the education and labor subcommittee on 
postsecondary education 
surely they deserve as much information as possible 
under the bill academic institutions must provide an annual 
report to the education department starting in 1992 on how many 
students receive athletic scholarships and the graduation rate by 
race and sex for students on football and basketball scholarships 
in addition colleges and universities must provide the 
graduation rate for all students as well as the rate for students 
on other athletic scholarships including baseball track and all 
other sports combined 
when a student is offered an athletic scholarship the college 
must provide the information to the student parents coach and 
guidance counselor 
the provisions on crime awareness and campus security take 
effect on sept 1 1991 and require the college to provide 
statistics on crimes that have occurred during the past three 
school years including murder rape and robbery 
the college also must report the number of arrests for liquor 
law violations drug abuse and weapons possession

a militant teachers federation 
on monday blamed the salvadoran army for complicity in the 
strangling of a teacher in a small western town 
teacher vilma chavez 42 was found strangled with a broken neck 
sunday night at her home in colon 25 miles west of san salvador 
according to police reports 
the colleagues murder corresponds to the accusations to which 
we have been subjected by president alfredo cristiani and the 
armed forces who say that our labor activities are part of 
guerrilla plans said saul sanchez a leader of the national 
salvadoran educators association 
chavez was a leader of the association which traditionally has 
been critical of the salvadoran government and has stepped up 
protests against the cristiani administration in recent months 
the administration last week issued a statement saying that 
some organizations of wellknown political affiliation are 
developing a plan of social agitation and tensionbuilding that 
coincides with plans the leadership of the fmlns leadership has 
reiterated 
the fmln is the farabundo marti national liberation front a 
rebel force that has been fighting a series of usbacked 
administrations in an 1lyearold civil war 
the cristiani administration contended in recent days that the 
use of arguments and demands that are impossible to meet by some 
leaders who are promoting strikes work stoppages and street 
demonstrations confirms that these are political not labor 
movements 
sanchez in an interview said that with these accusations 
they are condemning to death all teachers and all colleagues who 
demand better living conditions 
the salvadoran war has claimed an estimated 72000 lives most 
of them civilian human rights groups say as many as 30000 deaths 
have been at the hands of rightwing death squads 
authorities on monday charged five people among them one 
teacher add three university students with participating in a 
guerrilla attack on air force headquarters in san salvador on 
wednesday 
judge raul armado diaz said the five are accused of being 
members of the armed forces of liberation one of five military 
organizations that make up the fmln 
he said authorities seized chinesemade rocket launchers from 
the group members 
he identified the arrested as university of el salvador students

two labor leaders were killed monday 
hours before militant unions announced plans for a nationwide 
general strike to demand wage increases 
military officials ordered armed escorts on buses in the wake of 
both attacks which came one day after communist rebels burned two 
buses in the philippine capital of manila in support of the strike 
police said oscar lazaro 53 chief of an association of 
passenger jeep drivers was slain by at least four gunmen who 
entered his office in suburban paranaque 
in a separate incident a lone assailant fatally stabbed adriano 
yumul president of the metro port workers union as he was 
walking to a bus stop in central manila 
police were uncertain if the attacks were strikerelated 
lazaros association had not announced whether it would join in 
wednesdays threatened strike called to demand a pay increase of 
150 a day for all workers president corazon aquino has called 
the proposed pay hike excessive 
lazaros group refused to join a transport strike two weeks ago 
and had not supported protests called by more militant unions 
during a press conference after the killings leaders of the 
labor advisory consultative council which claims 15 million 
members announced plans for the strike unless the government meets 
pay raise demands by noon tuesday 
the workers have run out of patience so we have decided to go 
on with the strike said council leader fred bentulan 
on sunday rebels burned two buses in the suburbs of makati and 
pasig after ordering passengers to disembark 
the alex boncayao brigade the manila wing of the communist new 
peoples army said it carried out the attacks because the bus 
owners were antilabor and had pressured drivers not to join 
previous strikes 
defense secretary fidel ramos on monday ordered armed escorts on 
buses and additional police checkpoints were seen late monday on 
major thoroughfares 
last week unions rejected a 68centaday increase which they 
called insufficient to protect workers against spiraling costs of 
fuel food and utilities 
early tuesday bombs exploded in the manila headquarters of 
caltex inc and shell cos of the philippines both of which are 
seeking government approval to raise fuel prices because of the 
gulf crisis and the decline of the philippine peso police said no 
one was reported injured in the bombings 
in a radio address sunday mrs aquino urged workers not to 
endanger the very existence of your employer firms by asking for 
unrealistic wage increases 
most national strikes called in recent years have had a limited 
impact only about 10 percent of the work force is organized and 
the labor movement is divided 
but military rebels in the past have sought to exploit labor 
unrest to launch attempts to topple mrs aquino 
mrs aquino has survived seven military revolts since she took 
power in the february 1986 people power revolution that toppled 
the late president ferdinand marcos

white supremacist tom metzger and others 
must pay 125 million in damages to the family of a black man 
beaten to death by racist skinheads metzger is accused of 
inciting a jury ruled monday 
metzger 52 a former grand dragon of the ku klux klan was 
assessed 5 million and his white aryan resistance was ordered to 
pay 3 million in damages his son john 22 was must pay 1 
million in damages 
metzger was accused in the lawsuit of inciting the murder by 
sending an agent to portland to organize skinheads and teach them 
how to attack minorities 
metzger a tv repairman from aallbrook calif who said his 
family lives on 1200 a month said he couldnt come close to 
paying the judgment and probably would appeal 
ill be broke and under the constitution i can advocate 
violence now and nobody can sue me anymore said metzger so 
all the things im accused of that i didnt do i can do now 
the jury decided that kenneth mieske and kyle brewster two 
skinheads who pleaded guilty in the slaying must pay 500000 each 
in damages 
the wrongfuldeath suit brought by the family of mulugeta seraw 
sought 125 million and the jury awarded the entire amount it 
wasnt immediately clear how the remaining 25 breaks down among 
the defendants 
seraw a 27yearold ethiopian who planned to attend school in 
portland was attacked by three racist skinheads as he returned 
home from a party in november 1988 his head was split open by a 
softball bat 
people from this country have avenged my sons death for 
me seraws father seraw tekuneh said through an interpreter 
after the verdict was announced this is the happiest i feel 
since my son died because i know he has not died in vain 
the lead plaintiffs attorney morris dees of the southern 
poverty law center in montgomery ala noted the jury awarded all 
the damages he sought 
back home we say it cleans his plow dees said of the 
verdict 
this jury i believe has said there will be a new season for 
justice in the northwest and the hate and violence as preached by 
tom metzger hopefully will be shut down forever dees said 
jurors deliberated about five hours before reaching the verdict 
on an 111 vote 
the multnomah county circuit jury found that the metzgers and 
white aryan resistance conspired to do violence to minorities and 
that they were reckless in sending dave mazzella to portland as 
their agent 
metzger who served as his own attorney said the white 
separatist movement wouldnt be deterred by the ruling 
the verdict will cause the ire of a growing underclass of this 
country metzger said they made a fatal mistake i believe i 
think they shot themselves in the foot and as conditions change in 
the country i think youre going to see it 
the metzgers never faced criminal charges in the beating 
mieske pleaded guilty to murder and racial intimidation in the 
beating brewster to manslaughter and racial intimidation and a 
third skinhead steven strasser to manslaughter 
three years ago dees won a 7 million jury verdict against the 
united klans of america after two klansmen from mobile ala 
killed a 19yearold black man 
judge ancer haggerty told the jury that in order to return a 
verdict against the metzgers they must find that the metzgers 
through their agents substantially assisted or encouraged conduct 
leading to the fatal beating 
metzger told jurors that if he is found liable their own 
freedoms could be eroded as an example he said a juror could be 
sued for sending a coworker out for coffee if that person then 
held up a convenience store 
under this loose idea of agency youre all in trouble he 
said 
metzger attacked the credibility of dave mazzella 21 a former 
vice president of john metzgers aryan youth movement who was the 
plaintiffs star witness 
he contended that mazzella lied when he said the metzgers sent 
him to portland to stir up the local skinheads members of east 
side white pride mazzella said he since has changed his racist 
ways 
metzger noted that other witnesses said mazzella was the leader 
of a southern oregon skinhead group as recently as a few months 
ago 
mazzella exaggerates and wants to be in the spotlight in the 
center of the stage he said without dave mazzella there is 
no case 
the only thing youre here to decide is if there was a meeting 
of minds to specifically radicalize east side white pride and 
specifically find a black person and kill him metzger said if 
that didnt happen theres no case 
elden rosenthal an attorney for the plaintiffs said in his 
rebuttal that the first amendment wasnt the issue 
we have no evidence that tom or john metzger said go kill 
mulugeta seraw were not required to prove that he told the 
jury 
he said the plaintiffs had proven that the metzgers and mazzella 
conspired to create random acts of violence and the fact that in 
one of those random incidents a man died and thats why were 
here 
metzger said the case is a conspiracy to destroy him do you 
want to make me a martyr he asked jurors 
he also claimed he has few assets in many cases i could 
qualify for the poverty level he said 
rosenthal said the plaintiffs intent is not to become wealthy 
but to stop racist violence the way to do that rosenthal said is 
to strangle it financially 
this community indeed this country is going to remember your 
verdict for a long time he said

weapons plant on monday released a summary of a report critical of 
management and denied that safety was being jeopardized in the rush 
to restart plutonium reprocessing

gaithersburg md has done a study for egampg inc the plant 
contractor citing serious management problems at the plant in the 
last five months the plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons 
a summary of its report completed in august was released 
monday after the associated press last week reported parts of the 
document 
rocky flats workers who spoke on condition of anonymity told the 
ap that managers were endangering safety at the plant in a rush to 
restart operations which have been suspended since november 1989 
because of safety and environmental concerns 
the summary said the plants civilian management team failed 
to establish and implement a comprehensive management control 
program for procedure development for resuming operations 
egampg inc operates the plant outside denver for the department 
of energy plant officials acknowledged monday there was a push to 
get safety problems fixed at the plant but denied there is a rush 
to restart plutonium reprocessing at the expense of safety 
obviously wed like to get all the things fixed here that 
need fixing bob nelson plant manager for the department of 
energy told a news conference we have a budget and a certain 
number of dollars and wed like to get all we can for the money 
nelson denied there is a rush to restart plutonium reprocessing 
at the expense of safety 
john davis an assistant egampg manager who commissioned the 
report said it was ordered after he twice tried to submit 
procedures for doe approval that failed to meet federal 
requirements 
plant officials denied the report was responsible for the firing 
on friday of plant manager phil warner warner was replaced by 
james o zane an egampg vice president plant officials said in a 
statement that the company felt it was time for a change 
workers at the plant claimed problems are even worse than the 
report indicates 
one worker said that when he questioned whether he should 
install a fire door before checking if it standards for a nuclear 
plant a supervisor ordered him to go ahead and install because 
checking would take too long the worker said he checked records 
later and found it failed to meet federal standards 
workers also said socalled redline drawings which are used to 
identify critical operations at the plant were improperly drawn up 
over the past six months and many will have to be redone they said 
it could cost as much as 130 million to redo the work 
francis allhoff assistant general manager for administration 
and planning acknowledged that some of the drawings will have to 
be done over but he said most could be used in resuming operations 
of the plant even though they dont meet industry standards 
all of the redline drawings may not have been done correctly 
they will have to be redone but its not a big number he said

a popular republican launched a writein 
campaign for governor monday offering himself as an alternative to 
the gop candidate under fire over allegations he once asked 
teenage girls to go skinny dipping 
the entry of state auditor arne carlson as a writein candidate 
kind of took the wind out of a move by some state lawmakers to 
pressure jon grunseth to get out of the race said sanate minority 
leader duane benson 
his candidacy became controversial last week when two women 
stepped forward to say that when they were teenagers grunseth 
tried to get them to swim nude with him in the pool at his home 
at least nine minnesota newspapers have run editorials calling 
for grunseth to step aside 
the entry of the well known carlson offers republicans a choice 
some relieved party leaders noted 
a lot of people are kind of comfortable with two republican 
people in it said benson said but it would have really boiled 
had arne waited another day 
prior to carlsons announcement state rep elton redalen warned 
that grunseth could drag down the rest of the republican ticket 
unless he quits 
redalens call for grunseth to step aside came three days after 
an internal republican poll indicated that five state republicans 
could defeat democratic gov rudy perpich in the nov 6 election 
but that grunseth could not 
among the five was carlson who led perpich by a 55to29 
percent margin in the poll 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn said he helped initiate the 
survey and has urged grunseth to make a hardminded objective 
decision about his own chances and the chances of all the other 
candidates around him 
carlson who finished second to grunseth in the sept 11 
primary announced his writein candidacy at a news conference 
we can win he said 
carlson pledged a totally upbeat positive campaign 
this news conference is not to blame anyone but to allow all 
minnesotans to know full well that they are entitled to a campaign 
that will dedicate itself to the high road he said 
a statewide bipartisan coalition of voters known as minnesotans 
for the write choice had rallied earlier in the day to encourage 
carlson to run 
the nudeswimming allegations concern a 1981 fourth of july 
party at grunseths house two women who were 13 and 14 years old 
at the time alleged in sworn statements that an apparently 
intoxicated grunseth encouraged them his 13yearold daughter 
nina and a 16yearold girl to join him for a nude swim one of 
the women said grunseth tried to pull down the strap of her swim 
suit and to touch her breast 
grunseth has said that if any nude swimming occurred at the 
party it was after he went to bed have i ever been 
skinnydipping in my life he said sunday yeah so what 
he also referred to a period in the late 1970s and early 80s as 
his wild years a remark that redalen cited in calling for his 
departure from the race 
thats not acceptable to me or to my constituents down here 
redalen said he added that he finds unacceptable a lifestyle of 
fun and heavy drinking and womanizing even though its in the 
past 
grunseths continued presence in the race redalen said could 
bring down the entire republican statewide ticket and we could 
lose many of the seats we thought we could pick up in both the 
house and senate 
the republican poll showed grunseth trailing perpich 41 percent 
to 24 percent but grunseth campaign chairman leon oistad said 
another gop poll taken friday night and saturday morning showed 
that margin narrowing to a 37to27 percent perpich lead

drop in thirdquarter earnings 
dow jones has no mandatory retirement age except for its

a newswoman filed a sex discrimination 
lawsuit against into the night tv host rick dees claiming she 
was publicly humiliated by risque jokes during his appearance on a 
tv show 
liz fulton said in her superior court suit filed oct 16 that 
dees humiliated her by appearing on the wally george show in 
1988 with a scantily clad buxom woman he identified as miss 
fulton 
this is only the tip of the iceberg on how women are forced to 
endure sexual stereotypes in broadcasting but many dont file 
lawsuits because they fear they will be blackballed by the 
industry said attorney gloria allred 
dees a kiisfm radio personality who worked with miss fulton 
until she was fired in april recently began as host of the 
latenight variety show into the night starring rick dees 
jack silver a spokesman for kiisfm referred all calls to 
gannett radio which owns the station 
we have received the documents from liz fultons attorney and 
we are now reviewing them said jay cook gannett radio 
president we will respond when appropriate 
while acting as his radio show sidekick ms fulton said dees 
frequently referred to her as liz rugburn fulton 
in addition the suit said dees humiliated and damaged 
her when he appeared on the wally george show accompanied 
by a woman purporting to be ms fulton who was dressed in a scant 
bikini 
the impostor behaved in an inappropriate and embarrassing 
manner and was eventually led off the set in handcuffs 
ms allred said her client now a newswoman at kfi radio never 
consented to the impersonation 
additionally the suit states ms fulton 37 believes she was 
fired because she was perceived as too old and family oriented 
and not sufficiently sexy enough to satisfy mr dees 
dees was accused of employment discrimination on the basis of 
sex and age and unauthorized commercial use of miss fultons name 
invasion of privacy intentional misrepresentation and defamation 
ms fulton asked for general compensatory and punitive damages 
for humiliation mental anguish anger and emotional distress the 
dollar amount would be determined at trial

how boring is television 
television is so boring according to alan caruba that it rots 
your brain leads to drug and alcohol addiction encourages divorce 
and speeds societys demise 
which leaves waxy yellow buildup and ring around the 
collar as seemingly the only travesties in life not caused by an 
idle brain 
boredom is carubas speciality 
well boredom and public relations 
from his home in maplewood nj the 53yearold caruba founded 
the boring institute in 1984 intended as a spoof of the muchhyped 
entertainment world the institute publishes yearly lists of the 
most boring celebrities the most boring films and fearless 
forecasts of tvs fall flops 
caruba knows a lot about hype for 20plus years he has been in 
the public relations business his real job and before that he was 
a journalist 
i certainly have a very fine sense of hype caruba says in a 
phone interview from his home which he has shared with his parents 
for most of his bachelor life its almost as if im the doctor 
of hype 
when it comes to television predictions the doctor is in most 
of the time anyway 
this falls picks as the best of the worst 
earth force family man sons and daughters and 
uncle buck on cbs lifestories ferris bueller 
parenthood the fanelli boys and hull high on nbc 
cop rock and going places on abc and dea parker 
lewis cant lose and beverly hills 90210 on fox 
broadcasting co 
earth force has been canceled after three episodes 
sons and daughters probably wont make it onto the small screen 
until next year the rest of carubas cancellation predictions have 
yet to materialize but the shows ratings are lackluster 
carubas forecast is very successful he says mostly 
because its incredibly accurate if i may be so vain 
caruba may be vain but he also is good at getting the media to 
pay attention to him his lists have generated hundreds of radio 
interview requests several talkshow appearances and stories in 
the boston globe the new york times and newsday 
like mr blackwells annual worst dressed list carubas 
catalog punctures some of the biggest egos in hollywood among last 
years most boring celebs cher zsa zsa gabor and roseanne barr 
among last years tv cancellation predictions peaceable 
kingdom axed baywatch gone and sister kate outta 
here 
caruba says he has never heard a word from anyone at any of the 
networks about his yearly forecast i am widely and universally 
ignored by the networks in terms of their programmers 
not one would comment on carubas list for this column 
it doesnt take a genius to predict failure in television 
said brad turell foxs senior vice president of publicity 
but caruba has more in mind than just poking fun at television 
and celebrities he believes that boredom causes most of societys 
ills 
i take what i do very seriously says caruba whose efforts 
as the oneman boring institute include designating each july as 
antiboredom month 
he also publishes a pamphlet titled ten secrets to avoid 
boredom among its recommendations read more develop hobbies 
and be nice to yourself 
boredom in peoples lives causes depression and drug and 
alcohol abuse caruba says a lot of the major social issues 
start with something as common as boredom 
when it comes to television caruba says the boob tube is not 
only boring in its mediocrity it is a drug 
television is addicting he says it encourages people to 
abandon their lives and live vicariously through this emptiness on 
tv 
and though the mind seemingly zones out while watching the small

households know that when expenses exceed income 
they must a cut expenses b raise income or c simultaneously 
cut expenses and raise income 
judging from its record congress either does not know these 
choices or chooses to ignore them 
since 1976 federal spending under the budget control act has 
grown by more than 500 billion compared with half that in the 15 
preceding years those are comparable dollars adjusted for 
inflation 
for 13 of the 16 years under the act congress failed to pass 
its first budget resolution on time for seven of the past eight 
years it has failed to complete its budget before start of the new 
fiscal year 
as a consequence congress since 1975 has been forced to pass 46 
emergency stopgap spending bills and in six of the past 10 years 
the federal government has run out of funds 
households couldnt get away with it neither could businesses 
churches univerities or philanthropic organizations but whats 
impossible for all other institutions is marvelously easy for 
congress 
unless the law is changed the situation wont be any better in 
the future says the heritage foundation a conservative think 
tank it claims the law is flawed encouraging special interest 
spending and discouraging saving 
the tragedy of the system is that because everyone is to 
blame no one is to blame says mark b liedl director of the 
foundations congressional assessment project 
prior to 1974 presidents had the authority to refuse 
appropriations made by congress and they did so but in that year 
the congressional budget and impoundment control act was passed it 
expanded congressional control over the budget process while 
reducing the presidents powers to limit spending 
that situation exists today says liedl while 535 politicians 
in washington are empowered under the budget act to spend money no 
one is responsible for cutting spending 
since then congress has had a very tough time meeting 
requirements of the law it passed it routinely ignores its 
promises to cut spending says liedl 
in fact he says congress has reneged on each of five budget 
summit agreements between 1982 and 1989 failing to lower spending 
to agreedupon levels while including tax increases in four of the 
agreements 
whatever agreement is made this year he suggests will be no 
different for promises of future unspecified and unlikely cuts to 
be determined by its committees congress will immediately receive 
higher revenues through taxes 
congress itself recognized the problem passing in 1985 the 
grammrudmanhollings balanced budget and emergency deficit control 
act which provides for automatic across the board cuts if congress 
fails to make its own 
but laidl says congress simply ignores or modifies the law to 
avoid the consequences since 1985 it has voted 16 times to waive 
the law and he says increase spending freely 
it leaves congress with a prospending bias he says driven by 
specialinterst demands and an insatiable hunger for reelection 
a bias that compels members to rate local interests higher than the 
national good 
he contends that for common sense and financial logic the 
president must be granted lineitem veto authority which was 
eliminated in 1974 even now 43 of 50 governors have such powers 
he suggests elimination also of socalled baselines or 
estimated levels of funds that must be budgeted if existing 
services are to continue these baselines are not horizontal they 
always rise locking in higher spending 
in your household budget a cut would reduce expenditures below 
an earlier month or year in baseline budgeting you would raise 
the currentyear spending over that of the previous year and make 
any cuts from the higher figure 
finally he would encourage the injection of discipline into the 
budget process by requiring congress to pass a binding budget law 
each year rather than the current nonbinding budget resolution

youre standing in the river the cool water 
rushes through your legs and the round pebbles below massage your 
feet you reflect the river water is always the same and always 
different 
watching art of indonesia tales from the shadow world a 
documentary that airs tonight on pbs inspires buddhist meditations 
such as these piquing ones thoughts to consider natures more 
metaphysical lessons 
after all the lotus blossom like the self has many layers 
the documentary is more a montage of beguiling images than of 
explanatory narration there are lush shots of the verdant bali and 
java countryside wrapped in gauzy mist strange and unusual 
bronzeage icons of gods and goddesses temples sculptures and 
buddha statues with their mysterious mona lisa smiles 
spun between the evocative pictures are snippets of indonesian 
folklore the village blacksmith was revered because he forged new 
elements in the fire which cleansed and purifed the metals while 
creating something new 
there are magic scrolls singing healers wise women and the 
puppet master who tells tales of heroes and kings with his carved 
stick figures who dance before a linen screen 
writerdirector andrea simon took a film crew to numerous 
locations in indonesias 13000 island archipelago chain such as 
borobudur the largest buddhist monument where serene buddhas watch 
out over javas countryside 
turn from desire and leave behind the world of suffering a 
narrator intones 
if there is a problem with art of indonesia its that too 
much is packed into its scant 30 minutes the several vignettes 
quickly hopscotch around giving it a blustery feel like an 
autumn leaf tossed in the wind 
although it lacks a cohesive thread the documentary does retain 
the quality of the river water running through your feet always 
different always the same but refreshing nonetheless 
the film coincides with an art exhibition the sculpture of 
indonesia and an 18month long festival of indonesia which 
began last month in washington dc and includes 250 events and 
exhibitions in more than 50 cities according to the filmmakers 
the sculpture of indonesia opened at the national gallery of 
art in washington dc and will travel to the museum of fine arts 
in houston the metropolitan museum of art in new york and the 
asian art museum in san francisco 
art of indonesia was produced by the national gallery of art 
and the metropolitan museum of art and underwritten by mobil 
corporation

editors note medicine has been encroaching on death for years 
now pushing existing technology to the limit but now out of the 
laboratory comes a new approach using two new technologies that 
can alter our own bodies and instruct them how to beat the bum raps 
that nature deals out 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

imagine killer cells coded to make them 
more potent that go to the heart of cancers and make them bleed to 
death a kind of microscopic dumdum bullet that saves lives 
also think about cells equipped with missing genes that are 
injected into humans to thwart those deficits of nature that leave 
numberless humans to suffer shortened lives 
then consider 
in september a child began to receive cells reaped from her own 
body and genetically altered to cure a disease that would otherwise 
have left her at the mercy of infections that would only deal 
normal people a glancing blow 
so far 10 melanoma victims each of whom had barely three 
months to live have been given altered cells that proved for the 
first time that foreign genes could be introduced into humans 
safely and could remain biologically active in the human body 
coincidentally three of the first five showed dramatic shrinking 
of their tumors and one had complete remission 
and the same scientists who conducted these tests are ready to 
introduce altered genes into humans to enhance the potency of 
killer cells to tumors to help them fight a variety of cancers that 
would otherwise overwhelm their immune systems 
two different therapies are coming together immunotherapy 
helping the immune system to fight established cancers and gene 
transfer in which a debilitated cell is corrected by inserting a 
healthy gene for a defective one 
its as if a door is opening and a small shaft of light is 
reaching into the very processes that control our lives 
there is evidence right here and now that mankind can instruct 
its own genes tell them what to do 
how many thousands of currently doomed human beings will be 
saved is not yet ours to know but it is hard to hold back the 
breathtaking possibilities 
you have to remember that last year in the united states 
cancer killed 495000 people says dr steven rosenberg of the 
national institutes of health that means that one of six 
americans now alive is going to die of cancer thats in spite of 
our best available treatments and we have good treatments we can 
cure half of everybody who develops the disease using surgery and 
radiation and chemotherapy but the half that cant be cured is 
more americans every year than died in world war ii and vietnam 
combined 
so we are in desperate need of new cancer treatments and these 
biological approaches im hoping will become a fourth way to treat 
cancer they can join surgery radiation and chemotherapy 
they are intrinsically different biological therapies dont 
directly attack the cancer rather they try to alter the host so 
that the hosts own natural defenses will lead to the rejection of 
the cancer thats the avenue we are pursuing 
and there is a sense of urgency 
dr w french anderson a gene therapy researcher at nih and 
editor of the new journal of human gene therapy wrote recently 
that he remembered the anguished words at a public forum of one 
ola huntley three of whose children have the inherited disease 
called sickle cell anemia 
she said i resent the fact that a few wellmeaning 
individuals have presented arguments strong enough to curtail the 
scientific technology which promises to give hope to those 
suffering from a genetic disease 
that was in 1983 
in an editorial this summer dr anderson asked rhetorically 
whats the rush 
the rush is the daily necessity to help sick people their 
our illnesses will not wait for a more convenient time we need 
help when we are sicksoask the cancer patient who has only a 
few months to live ask the aids patient whose body is shriveling 
ask ola huntley the rush arises from our human compassion for 
our fellow man who needs help now it will take many years of 
clinical studies before gene therapy can be a widely used treatment 
procedure the sooner we begin the sooner patients will be 
helped 
it has begun and in coming years it could explode 
there are plans for clinical trials at research institutions all 
across the country dr malcolm brenner at st jude childrens 
research hospital in memphis tenn is designing a clinical trial 
to fight juvenile leukemia and certain solid tumors dr ken 
cornetta at the university of wisconsin is doing the same for adult 
leukemia and some solid tumors 
dr mike lotze at the university of pittsburgh is planning a 
clinical trial similar to the ones being done at nih using tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes tils to goad the immune system into 
throwing off cancers there are half a dozen other experiments 
planned 
all of us have cancers in us all of the time dr anderson 
explains we have about 50 trillion cells in our body and 
occasionally something is going to go wrong but our immune systems 
recognize that and keep it down only when a group of cells is 
dividing out of control and overwhelm the immune defenses do you 
get a cancer what steve rosenbergs approach has been for 15 years 
is to help the immune system fight back 
in the first wave of experiments in immunotherapy against 
cancer the tils have been the weapon of choice the scientists 
readily admit they were lucky with the first five patients while 
the experiment was designed basically to demonstrate the safety of 
inserting foreign genes into human cells the byproduct was lives 
saved 
pieces of tumors were excised from the five and minced and grown 
outside the body with interleukin2 a substance that encourages 
lymphocyte growth in the body

the active cells massproduced doubling and redoubling in days 
the idiosyncrasy of these cells is that they home in on tumors from 
which they were derived the cells were then reinjected into the 
patients 
three of the five patients showed antitumor effects one 
patient a 27yearold mother had over 30 melanoma tumors in her 
lung skin and mouth a particularly virulent cancer untreatable in 
advanced stages they have all disappeared and she is back at work 
a second patients tumor was completely arrested stopped in its 
tracks she is back at work teaching aerobic dancing a third 
patient had 95 percent to 98 percent reduction in his tumors but 
it failed to hold for 30 days he was retreated and this time the 
tumor was arrested but after a year he slipped back again and died 
last sept 14 
that same day the nih team used a different technique on a 
4yearold girl who was suffering from a rare disease severe 
combined immunodeficiency scid which leaves its victim 
defenseless against infection and cancers 
these children who used to be called bubble babies after 
the extreme isolation required to protect them from disease can be 
maintained by giving them a missing enzyme called adenosine 
deaminase and in fact being on that therapy is a requirement for 
the current gene transfer therapy there are fewer than 20 scid 
patients in the world 
the 4yearolds blood was taken and the tlymphocytes were 
given a gene for the missing enzyme they were grown in profusion 
outside the body and then a billion of them were infused into the 
child 
the treatment will continue but it may be months before 
appreciable results can be seen one reason is caution some people 
are still worried about tinkering with human genes and perhaps 
creating frankenstein diseases that could run rampant but the 
protocols under which this work is done have been carefully 
designed 
the worst case scenario muses anderson the father of gene 
therapy who with other scientists has spent three years thinking of 
the worst that can happen i dont think anything that could 
happen could surprise us short of a meteor coming through the 
roof 
for years they will test for the chance that a recombinate virus 
would emerge that is infectious and pathologic but the chances are 
so slim after all the animal studies anderson says it would be a 
tremendous surprise because there is no place it could come from 
the things that could happen the thing that is most 
worrisome the thing that keeps me awake at night is that she the 
4yearold patient could run into a major problem which has 
nothing to do with the therapy 
an air embolus during reinjection could get into the lung and 
she could gasp three times and die unrelated to anything 
it would be a major setback for gene therapy he says 
another possibility is that the therapy could unlock a 
cancercausing gene or stymie a cancerinhibiting gene the other 
possibility is that the treatment could work too well and instead 
of giving her genecorrected cells in a uniform way would give her 
spotty protection leaving holes in her protection as a result 
they made the rules of the game so safe that it will be a year 
before we know if weve done anything to help at all 
dr michael blaese another member of the team latched onto 
lymphocytes as a vehicle for altered genes when work with blood 
marrow cells proved too tricky until we have other tissues to 
work with besides lymphocytes the number of diseases we can work 
with will be minimal he says when the bone marrow puzzle is 
solved then there will be many more diseases but still a 
relatively small number 
they tried originally to alter the genes in stem cells of the 
blood marrow which would follow more natural pathways of immune 
cells but stem cells are quiet and reproduce only spasmodically 
not enough of a response could be built up quickly or consistently 
which led to the lymphocyte approach 
which led to the next step which is to harness tumor necrosis 
factor cells some of the most potent killer cells in the immune 
system a gene transfer would make these cells multiply in the body 
and greatly enhance the response to tumors 
and the future for gene transfer with further progress the 
treatment of a number of genedefective diseases hemophilia 
cystic fibrosis diabetes to name a few all stem from a genetic 
deficiency in which nature failed to program the cells to produce 
needed enzymes or proteins gene transfer can correct those 
deficiencies 
the most immediate weapon will be the use of altered genes in 
lymphocytes to fight cancer and facing the question of why some 
patients respond and some do not 
its a very hard question to answer says rosenberg 
peoples cancers are different every cancer differs from every 
other cancer and people are differentso the nature of their 
tumors and the nature of their immunological responses are 
relatively unique 
right now we are at the infancy of understanding what those 
interactions are 
i sort of put the development of these biological therapies to 
where the wright brothers were in 1903 you know weve shown the 
plane can get off the ground but they werent carrying 
passengers they werent carrying mail they only went 75 yards 
but they showed it was possible what weve shown right now is that 
it is possible 
the challenge now is to make it more potent more widely 
applicable

this is a philosophy that says progress is possible that 
government can be limited by the contract people agreed to enter 
into she says 
she adds adam smiths thought that man is led by an invisible 
hand to act in ways that benefit all of society 
minutes later she comes back to that thought and adds a personal 
twist 
in raising her three sons she says it took a very visible 
hand to order my society 
the class chuckles and later a student comments 
she always mentions her family the fact she is a mother one 
way or the other she always brings it up 
as an american diplomat in a hostile world jeane kirkpatrick had 
a rather austere public image an image she largely retains 
in fact she is surprisingly motherly the student says 
she says she takes pains at teaching because she wants to be as 
good a teacher as she would have wanted her own sons to have when 
they went to college 
she is remarkably available says robert vanasse a graduate 
student from new bedford conn shes great at teachingi never 
would have gotten the idea or inspiration for my masters thesis 
without direct support from her 
mrs kirkpatrick never officially left the georgetown faculty 
during her united nations years she was on leave of absence 
throughout the period 
would jeane kirkpatrick ever give up teaching and return to 
public life 
im not saying i never would the professor of political 
science replies but i doubt it 
since leaving the reagan administration in 1985 the year she 
switched her party affiliation from democratic to republican jeane 
kirkpatrick has been taking the temperature of change and plotting 
its course and spelling out her conclusions in speeches and a 
syndicated column that now runs in about 100 newspapers 
she is using the column a journal of the changes going on in 
the soviet union and eastern europe as the basis for a book 
the withering away of the totalitarian state 
i was paying attention when i saw early on some basic 
deviation and changes in marxistleninist theory and practice 
she says 
i was saying gorbachev was for real before a lot of people 
says the professor known as a scourge of the communist system i 
shocked a lot of people but i was really watching it more 
closelyit caused me to conclude that something really 
fundamental was going on 
where may the changes resulting from the collapse of communism 
end 
i think not only is the cold war over but it goes far beyond 
that she says nineteen eighty nine marked the year in which 
the dog didnt bark gorbachev kept the troops in their barracks 
as the face of eastern europe changed 
i know its not over yet but i think weve come to the end of 
communism in europe 
what we learned was the communist empire was sustained by 
force force turned out to be the keystone of the arch and when 
force wasnt used the whole structure collapsed 
mrs kirkpatrick has lately been portrayed in some circles as 
opposing president bushs decision to rush troops to defend saudi 
arabia in the aftermath of iraqs august 2 invasion of kuwait 
some have lumped her with other conservatives such as 
commentator patrick buchanan as embracing isolationism as the 
cold war thaws 
she calls that a misunderstanding and says it occurred when she 
responded to a question about bushs persian gulf policy in an 
academic rather than a political mode 
i said i did not believe the united states had a distinctive 
national interest in the gulf but that we shared an interest with a 
good many other nations and because it was shared it was important 
that we have a shared response she says 
as for president bush 
he is recognizing there are broad shared interacting 
interests and is putting together an international coalition to 
deal with the problem she says 
i am no kind of isolationist i dont even think isolationism 
is possible in the contemporary world 
and if it was i wouldnt be one

washington ap jeane kirkpatrick first met soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev in 1987 she was not impressed 
i was not charmed by gorbachev says the former us 
ambassador to the united nations but i did understand that he 
was a very nontypical soviet leader very different as a human 
type and as a political type 
about the same time she talked with soviet dissident andrei 
sakharov who told her that gorbachev was not only the soviet 
unions best chance for reform but its only chance 
then there was glasnost 
always in the past soviet leaders had treated opinion as a 
reflection of ones position in the class struggle mrs 
kirkpatrick says 
if you believe opinions are an expression of class struggle 
someone who has a difference of opinion is really your enemy in an 
ongoing class war she says differences of opinion were 
eliminated after the revolution it led to all kinds of distortions 
of reality in the soviet union 
then under gorbachevs glasnost differences of opinion were 
suddenly legitimate 
this is an absolutely heretical opinion she says it 
opened the way for an enormous liberalization of the media 
this was such a basic revision of marxist doctrine that all my 
antennae went up they went boing 
i said if this man knows what he is doing he is making a 
major deviation 
weve literally had an earthquake

editors note sales of kosher food products have mushroomed 
dramatically in recent years and dozens of new kosher restaurants 
are opening from coast to coast one big reason say rabis and 
sociologists is that young professional jews are returning to 
their orthodox religious roots 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
a kosher craze spreading across the country 
has added a new word to the marketing lexicon 
fruppie thats a jewish yuppie who is fromm the yiddish 
word for religious 
and rabbis sociologists and marketing consultants say the 
number of fruppies is growing as jewish baby boomers return to 
their orthodox religious roots after experimenting with and 
rejecting other lifestyles 
orthodox jews today are far more visible than they were 10 or 
15 years ago theyve come out of the shtetl says steve ostrow 
of middletown ny who recently published a guide to 850 kosher 
restaurants in the united states canada and mexico 
one of the measures of their growing numbers is an explosion in 
sales of kosher foods 
according to figures from lubicom a marketing company that 
sponsors the international kosher food trade show twice a year in 
new york city the number of different kosher products available 
has increased from 1000 in 1977 to 20000 this year at the same 
time sales ballooned from 290 million to 175 billion a year as 
companies from coors beer to pepperidge farm have been awarded 
kosher certification 
manufacturers pay an annual fee to supervisory agencies the 
largest of which is the union of orthodox congregations to inspect 
their plants and certify products as kosher some have had to 
reformulate recipes switch to kosher ingredients and buy new 
kitchen equipment 
certification has become a marketing tool says lubicom 
president menachem lubinsky beer is inherently kosher yet coors 
opted to try to obtain the symbol from the orthodox union 
but lubinsky notes that only 15 million consumers of the 6 
million who buy kosher products are jewish about 15 million are 
muslims and seventhday adventists whose religions also forbid 
eating pork the rest are vegetarians and others who buy kosher 
food because they think its healthier than nonkosher food 
i as a marketer am astounded lubinsky says but he adds 
its consistent with the yuppie lifestyle people are 
entertaining more theyre going out to eat more 
jews are the most affluent ethnic group in america says 
queens college sociologist steven cohen when you combine 
affluence with education you get upperclass and 
uppermiddleclass tastes 
preparation of kosher food at home also has opened new markets 
here in teaneck a mediumsized suburb of new york city that is 
home to about 1500 orthodox jewish families the latest fad is 
kosher kitchens 
for between 20000 and 125000 an ordinary kitchen can be 
remodeled to make it easier to follow the dietary rules of 
kashruth which requires the complete separation of dairy and meat 
products from preparation to eating to cleanup families often buy 
double sets of appliances sinks and kitchen utensils 
i wanted two dishwashers and more counter space and i didnt 
want to knock down walls says basheva goldberg who remodeled in 
1984 i had to compromise on nothing 
mrs goldberg called lingold design and construction in queens 
ny and has since collaborated with owner david linzer on dozens 
of kosher kitchen projects throughout northern new jersey new york 
and connecticut 
linzer takes care of the nuts and bolts while mrs goldberg a 
teacher of jewish adult education tells him what observant jews 
want in a kitchen 
exotic kosher food was born on manhattans lower east side in 
1959 when solomon bernstein the founder of bernsteinonessex 
kosher restaurant decided o substitute veal for pork to make a 
kosher eggroll 
the repertoire was soon expanded with the help of chinese chefs 
to include other popular cantonese dishes with chicken and veal 
replacing nonkosher shrimp and pork says bernsteins grandson 
ira rosenfeld 
from that humble beginning kosher restaurant fare has come a 
long way from the borscht chopped liver and chicken schmaltz that 
were staples of the russian and eastern european jewish shtetls or 
villages before world war ii 
while the greatest concentration of kosher restaurants is in new 
york city more than 30 have opened in los angeles in the past five 
years according to ostrow the guidebook writer and new kosher 
eateries are popping up in atlantic city miami chicago san 
francisco and brookline mass he says 
theres been a return to jewish ritual says rabbi menachem 
genack head of the kashruth department at the manhattanbased 
orthodox union people are coming back 
a major culinary sensation on the haute kosher circuit was the 
introduction of kosher venison at levana restaurant in manhattan 
deer meat had not been considered kosher because no one had made 
arrangements for the kosher slaughter of the animals says levana 
owner sol kirschenbaum 
under the many rules spelled out in the torah and the talmud 
animals that qualify as kosher must be killed by specially trained 
rabbis these shohets slit the animals throat to minimize its 
suffering and inspect the organs to ensure they are diseasefree 
from animals that pass the rigorous inspection comes glatt 
kosher meat the highest designation of purity in the kosher 
universe 
a year ago kirschenbaum arranged for a shohet to perform the 
ritual slaughter on a deer farm in upstate new york 
describing himself as a balei tshuva or one who has 
returned to the faith the 39yearold graduate of city college of 
new york says he is typical of a generation of jews who were raised 
in secular homes but became more religious than their parents 
we got spoiled by fine foods and fine wines we had eaten at 
lutece and the four seasons he says referring to two of 
manhattans fine restaurants when we opened the restaurant we 
decided we would try to serve what was current and spectacular not 
traditional kosher food 
about 10 percent of the 59 million jews in the united states 
are orthodox according to the american jewish committee cohen 
estimates the kosherkeeping population at between 500000 and 18 
million depending on ones definition of kosher 
many jews with only one set of dishes dont feel comfortable 
eating nonkosher ham and bacon while the most observant will buy 
only those dairy products labeled cholov yisroel which means 
that the milking and the processing were supervised by an orthodox 
jew 
the most marked difference today in the american jewish 
community says cohen is that jews across the religious spectrum 
feel more intensely jewish 
my grandparents who were observant gave birth to parents who 
are less so he says now our generation is more ideologically 
jewish

editors note it was a rollicking city with wideopen gambling 
and a race track a europeanstyle spa in americas southland but 
the tourist trade in hot springs cooled off in recent years after 
the casinos were shut down and most of the bathhouses closed now 
the city is taking on a new look with a burgeoning colony of 
artists 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
across from bathhouse row new art 
galleries hold the paintings and sculptures of local and 
international artists at magees cafe poets from 8 to 87 years 
old gather each week to read their works to standingroomonly 
crowds 
this old spa where once the high and the low came to take the 
waters bet the horses and party the night away is enjoying a 
cultural renaissance a burgeoning colony of artists is 
revitalizing the rundown downtown area 
the artists colony is centered on central avenue across from 
the twoblock row of nine mediterraneanstyle thermal bathhouses 
built between 1892 and 1936 and now designated a national historic 
landmark district 
the city for decades was a wideopen mecca for gamblers al 
capone and rival gangsters came to relax under a truce then in 
1967 gov winthrop rockefeller sent in the state police to shut 
down the casinos 
this city of about 33000 people adjacent to hot springs 
national park has been in economic decline since 
getting into hot water is not as popular as it once was by late 
october only about 22000 people had partaken of the mineral baths 
this year as compared with more than 100000 in 1978 
only one of the baths on bathhouse row is open for business 
owned by the national park service and leased to a private

a growing number of gallery owners also have moved in buying up

i think this is the most wonderful thing that could happen to 
hot springs ms jamison says if these galleries can survive 
it will bring other cultural things to this town its changing the 
whole tone of the town 
john eagleheart plays his guitar for the cafes audience a 
visitor from scotland offers songs from her homeland a massage 
therapist reads a fairy tale and brings tears to his own eyes 
paul tucker known as the singing neurologist reads robert 
browning 
bud kenny who two years ago walked from pennsylvania to 
california with a dog and a pack horse moderates the evenings 
lineup which is carried live on radio station kbhs 
a key figure in the hot springs art scene is a painter named 
benini 
benini he uses no other name sat on a couch for a recent 
interview beneath a huge heavylined portrait of himself two 
small braids tied in black ribbon reached to his beard 
he is cited by many in the community as the driving force behind 
hot springs renaissance 
benini moved to hot springs in september 1988 from central 
florida he and his wife lorraine were returning from an exhibit 
of beninis works at a fort smith arts center when they took a 
wrong turn off the interstate he says 
i was blown away by the old elegance and beauty at night 
benini says night is very beautiful in old cities 
benini 49 left his hometown of imola italy when he was 14 
he said hot springs reminds him of the italian countryside the 
baths remind him of europe 
the environment allows him the peace to pursue what has become 
his passion during the last three to five years bright acrylics 
and threedimensional geometric shapes that spill from the canvas 
artists who have moved to hot springs some at beninis urging 
say hot springs appeal is manifold its undiscovered its 
reminiscent of europe the mountains are enticing and the hot 
baths are a curiosity 
its probably the most european spa atmosphere in the united 
states says paul sullivan a curator with the national park 
service 
about five blocks from central avenue in an elementary school 
turned studio jeanfo a sculptor originally from the south of 
france welds steel in a cavernous gym some 250 steel sculptures 
from 3 to 7 feet tall line the hallways of jeanfo studios 
this is something very different because the environment is 
not the same jeanfo says people are not the same in new 
york there are toosophisticated people who know perhaps too 
much about art 
and its cheap jeanfo says buying the same amount of space in 
france new york or the west coast would have cost 10 times as 
much 
low overhead for gallery owners allowed them to drop their 
commission to 33 percent instead of the 67 percent that is 
standard in new york says gallery owner debrah phillips 
when i came up here from florida people thought i was 
committing professional suicide ms herrchambliss says but her 
gallery is booked through may 1991 she says 
paul tucker a hot springs doctor and his wife suzanne 
restored four buildings and donated the use of one of them to the 
nonprofit hot springs arts center for five years 
theres a much more eclectic collection of art here than in 
other places tucker says 
but even before the arts came in tucker says hot springs was 
an unusal town 
this was a town with open gambling this was a town with open 
prostitution it has one of the biggest race tracks so its always 
been unusual 
even before the arts it was a city of complexity

editors note the sadistic murder of a teenager was the stuff 
of horror movies played out in the rolling wheat fields of the 
texas panhandle charged with the murder is a 19yearold who once 
told a friend his heroes were serial killers ted bundy charles 
manson and jack the ripper and while he awaits trial local 
residents worry that there will be other attacks by other 
satanists

it was friday the 13th a steamy night 
in july when 17yearold frankie garcia was taken to a barn 
outside an abandoned shack known locally as the haunted house 
to meet his death 
witnesses who found the body say garcia apparently was forced to 
kneel in the dirt and taste the barrel of a highpowered 
223caliber rifle as his killer pulled the trigger 
local residents were shocked when word got out that a 
selfprofessed satanist had confessed to the murder 
kenneth glenn milner a 19yearold admirer of charles manson 
and jack the ripper has been charged with murdering garcia a 
former friend he is also charged with the attempted murders of 
kenneth williams his former high school principal and jimmy 
britten a former girlfriends stepfather that same night 
the 2300 people who live in this farming town worry that there 
will be other attacks parents closely watch their children 
keeping them off the dirt roads that crisscross the rolling wheat 
fields of the region 
there is fear that there are more satanists out there says 
linda salas who has four children there are rumors that they 
are looking for a blondhaired blueeyed boy to sacrifice 
milner has been held without bond in the carson county jail 
since his arrest the day after garcias killing a killing a friend 
says milner bragged about committing 
he said he shot williams and then said i finished off 
frankie garcia says 16yearold carrie horner then he took a 
gun out and shot a hole through the window of his car to prove he 
was serious 
carson county district attorney david mccoy who will seek the 
death penalty said milner gave police a written confession in 
which he said he wanted to die 
mr milner has indicated a strong desire to die and i intend 
to do all i can to see his wishes are accommodated mccoy said 
courtappointed defense attorney douglas woodburn of amarillo 
says the trial could begin as early as january but he will likely 
seek a change of venue 
there has been extensive publicity of the case and panhandle 
is a small town woodburn says and its a common notion of 
fair play that everyone should start off in a trial with no 
preconceived ideas of the case 
as for the rumors that satanism was involved woodburn says i 
dont think thats a guiding influence in his life but i just 
dont know 
carson county sheriff terry timmons would not permit an 
interview with milner milners parents who run a bar called 
shirleys just outside of panhandle would not discuss the case 
or their only son 
but milners friends say he is obsessed with death and spent 
countless hours watching horror movies reading books about satan 
and creating special effects like those used in slasher movies 
he knew every horror movie by heart says 18yearold 
katrina powell who lived next door to milner for 14 years he 
would make masks of characters in the horror movies grotesque 
masks like with blood and an eyeball hanging out 
craig shackelford 16 milners best friend said his pal 
frequently discussed creating an illusion of shooting a person 
through the mouth 
milner imagined attaching a lowpower plastic explosive to the 
back of someones head sticking a gun in their mouth and 
simultaneously pulling the trigger and setting off the explosives 
to make it appear the person had been shot shackelford said 
he wanted to know what that would look like he said 
shackelford said milner has a twisted sense of humor loves 
to scare the hell out of people and enjoys notoriety 
milners bedroom is lined with black ghoulish posters from 
horror movies shackleford said he said the room also contains a 
clay corpse milner made to test his special effects and a cast of 
his own head covered with a demon mask 
milner wrote shackelford from his jail cell chastising his 
best closest friend for not writing im not going to shoot 
you through the postal service or anything he joked 
glenn wasnt normal shackelford said but i dont think 
he was a satanist either 
glenn read the bible from cover to cover he read other books 
too like the necronomican and stuff about astral projection he 
didnt know what to believe so he would explore the 
necronomican is a handbook of spells that supposedly summon demons

shackelford said milner told him some of his heroes were ted 
bundy charles manson and jack the ripper 
glenn admired jack the ripper because he was never caught 
he said 
friends and school officials say milner was a wellbehaved 
student through grade school but began showing signs of depression 
in high school 
he started to drink more ms powell says and sometimes 
when he would get angry he would slice up his arms with a knife 
in the spring of 1988 milner climbed to the top of a water 
tower and threatened to jump police talked him out of it 
a few months later while driving alone he ran his car over a 
cliff at palo duro canyon after being treated for injuries his 
friends say he was placed in psychiatric care at northwest texas 
hospital in amarillo the hospital refused to confirm milners 
stay 
glenn and i talked about the times he tried to kill himself a 
lot shackelford says he did it because he wanted to know what 
was on the other side 
an entry milner wrote in shackelfords high school yearbook the 
day before garcia was killed leads shackelford to believe milner 
planned the alleged attacks 
your wisdom and advice have helped me out many times milner 
wrote wish it could on the problem that i face now wish i 
could tell you but youll find out sooner or later 
the entry was signed damion the misspelled name of the 
antichrist in a series of horror films 
he liked people to call him damien shackelford says he 
liked people to take a step back when he introduced himself as 
damien 
those who knew garcia and milner say they were not very good 
friends 
frankie really got on glenns nerves said ron doty 19 a 
companion of both frankie tried really hard to be everyones 
friend 
so when milner invited garcia to go out on the town on friday 
the 13th garcia told shackelford he was skeptical 
glenn doesnt even like me does he shackelford quoted 
garcia as saying in a telephone conversation a couple hours before 
he was killed he just wants to take me out and pull a prank on 
me scare the hell out of me 
police say garcia was killed about 10 pm about 1030 pm 
shackelford and doty noticed milner speeding out of town after 
cathing up with milner shackelford said he asked his friend what 
he was doing 
both doty and shackelford recall milner responding i just got 
done taking care of some business ive got to go take care of some 
more 
britten whose stepdaughter jenny english once dated milner 
says milner slashed his throat and arms with a straight razor 
shortly after 1 am on july 14 
ms english said milner began vomiting during the attack 
allowing britten to overpower him 
two hours later three shots were fired from a 357caliber 
magnum revolver through a door at ken williams milners former 
high school principal 
williams was struck in the leg and abdomen authorities said 
the other shot missed 
both williams and britten are recovering 
milner did not like the way britten treated his stepdaughter and 
he thought williams was spreading rumors about him to other kids in 
the high school shackelford said 
milner also left behind a hit list of intended victims and a 
videotape detailing his motives and plans according to his friends 
who have been questioned by police 
four days after the attacks state district judge john t forbis 
placed a gag order on attorneys and investigators 
shackelford says he doubts if milner cares what happens to him 
now 
i think he would have committed suicide eventually 
shackelford said i think he wants to die i think the death 
penalty would probably please him

editors note if many communities have bookmobiles that 
deliver library books to various neighborhoods alaska has taken 
the program a big step further in a special stateoperated 
service books are delivered by air to families far out in the 
bush for many of them it is their main source of entertainment and 
education 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the back country of alaska out of 
the reach of television commercial radio or even daily newspapers 
thousands of families are staying in touch the oldfashioned way 
theyre reading books 
bush pilots regularly fly library books to some 3000 alaskans 
to fulfill a promise dating from territorial days that all 
residents should have equal access to public libraries 
for people such as elaine and pete velsko and their two 
daughters who live on tutka bay 125 miles from anchorage those 
green mailbags full of books which arrive once or twice a month 
offer both education and entertainment 
my husband asks for all nonfiction he wants to keep up with 
the world elaine velsko says but i like my stories if i 
didnt get my green bags i think id perish out here 
mrs velsko has spent 13 years on tutka bay 14 miles from 
homer managing her modern ranch home and teaching her children 
ages 8 and 4 through correspondence courses her husband runs the 
state fish hatchery nearby 
the way some people might flick on a soap opera shell pull a 
novel out of the sack and read 
we are living more the pioneering life she says its 
what we want 
about 175 miles north in the village of skwentna joe and norma 
delia have spent 40 years on their 10acre homestead hunting 
trapping running the post office and reading flownin library 
books to their two children 
for my kids books were a big thing in their lives joe 
delia says they didnt have things that kids in town have to 
occupy their time 
begun in 1957 alaskas bush library service operated for more 
than a decade out of the state library at juneau but it 
specialized in historical and government material and for readers 
wasnt the same as being able to browse a library shelf or 
bookstore for a good read 
george smith who oversees the 265000 state grant that pays 
for the services postage and library staff says the service was 
transferred 10 years ago to the public libraries at juneau 
fairbanks and anchorage to give readers a chance at more 
contemporary collections 
only a fraction of the estimated 40000 people who live in rural 
alaska are signed up for books by mail 
one of them is writer janice schofield from her oneroom cabin 
in the rocky river valley near homer schofield began a study of 
grasses and flowers and was inspired to write a book on alaskas 
native plants 
her reference guides were almost exclusively library books 
delivered by mail plane and left for her at a remote mail shed on 
kantishna bay 
it was always great like having this little goody box coming 
in the mail she says 
to fetch the books schofield and her husband edward hiked or 
skied to their car drove to the end of the road and then hiked or 
skied another halfmile to reach the shed there the books went 
into backpacks and the schofields made their way back out 
discovering wild plants published last year by northwest 
discovery publications was the first book she ever researched by 
mail letting the library know generally what she needed and then 
waiting to see what turned up 
most people in the bush want popular fiction childrens books 
and popular nonfiction smith says 
they tell us what they want either they give us titles or 
they just specify a subject and then we choose the collections 
he says 
joe delia who says hell often rise at 3 am to finish a louis 
lamour novel or maybe a spy thriller by robert ludlum has been a 
patron of the bush library service for at least 20 years longer 
than almost anyone else once in a while he says hell open a 
fresh sack of six or 10 books only to find hes already read them 
the more i read the more i want to read says delia 59 
when we had nothing to read in the trap line cabins and this 
is no joke wed read the labels on cans 
i used to be able to tell you all the ingredients in a can of 
carnation milk i didnt pronounce it all correctly but i knew 
them 
in juneau or fairbanks or anchorage where a computer helps 
track the book requests librarians too can follow a familys 
progress by the books they want after a few years of being a 
familys personal bookshopper library workers get christmas cards 
or friendly notes 
we keep up a lot of correspondence says brenda bergsrud 
who works with the program at anchorages zj loussac library 
a parent will write and say tanya likes horses so send us 
horse books and then tanya will send us a picture of a horse we 
start to feel like family

will smith keeps a chessboard handy on the 
set of nbcs fresh prince of bel air but like the character he 
plays what hed really like is a pool table 
smith a grammywinning rap singer known as fresh prince 
frequently plays chess when hes not working on his new nbc comedy 
series the show is his acting and television debut in the role of 
a tough street kid from philadelphia sent to live with wealthy 
relatives in bel air 
the comedy hinges on his attempts to adjust to the alien 
environment of wealth and excess and to bring his relatives back 
in touch with their humbler roots 
the 21yearold smiths frequent chess opponent is joe marcell 
who plays geoffrey the butler as though hes just stepped out of 
masterpiece theatre theyve also had a game on an episode of 
the comedy series 
i play a lot of chess but i dont know if i could say its a 
passion smith says pool is more of a passion with me i put 
in a request for a pool table on the set 
smith sees a similarity between himself and his character also 
named will smith and nicknamed fresh prince smith also comes from 
the philadelphia area and says he prefers not to fit in 
ive never done any acting he says ive never had any 
formal theatrical training whatsoever im playing a character i 
designed five years ago for my rap concerts its pretty much a 
part of me now 
smith like his character is a person who smoothes the way with 
incredible charm and an ability to think and talk fast on the 
screen he seems at ease and natural although his lack of training 
and experience occasionally surfaces in scenes with other cast 
members 
prior to its premiere in september nbc ballyhooed the show as 
its breakaway hit of the seasn as often happens to highly touted 
young racehorses it stumbled coming out of the gate abcs cop 
rock stumbled even more so as did abcs chicken soup last 
year 
in the ratings for its first weeks fresh prince has been 
barely ahead of its monday night competition cbs uncle buck 
and abcs mcgyver and trailing abcs nfl monday night 
football 
part of the problem may be that the audience apparently is not 
reacting well to smiths making fun of middleclass values as a 
result some of the sharper edges of the humor are being honed 
down 
fresh prince like nbcs ferris bueller which 
immediately follows it is part of televisions trend of 
youthoriented comedies replacing sitcom with punkcom 
in such shows including nbcs hull high and foxs parker 
lewis cant loose wisecracking kids outsmart slowwitted adults 
among those hoping that smiths fresh prince recording and 
stage performance success will transfer to a new audience is 20th 
century fox which recently signed him for an actionadventure 
movie 
smith picked up the nickname prince in school it has nothing to 
do with rock singer prince 
my eighthgrade teacher started calling me prince and it sort 
of stuck he says she did that because i was a pretty charming 
guy i had a couple of different names i dont remember all of 
them when youre rapping you change your name every week trying to 
find one that fits once i was willie will i settled on prince in 
1986 then i added fresh because thats the new slang for cool 
i was performing rap at parties by 1981 and getting paid for 
it i always did rap i play a little piano and guitar 
his rap partner was jeff townes and by 1986 they had become 
dj jazzy jeff amp the fresh prince their first single was girls 
aint nothin but trouble which they recorded on their own label 
and sold nearly 200000 copies in pennsylvania delaware and new 
jersey a major company picked it up and it became an international 
hit 
theyve since recorded three albums one of which sold 3 million 
copies a fourth album is due out next year 
fresh prince is not very different from will smith he says 
hes funloving mischievous and very handsome hes just a sweet 
fellow its me not a character its just me rapping or acting 
rap is the only real musical art form we have in america now 
other than jazz you can listen to elvis presley and other stuff 
its all stolen from black americans elvis is nothing but bits of 
little richard and chuck berry 
rap is more expressive and more individual you have to write 
your own material because rap comes from the heart id never sing 
anyone elses song 
smith says the show is loosely based on the life of benny 
medina a record company executive who is a coproducer of the 
series 
he literally went from the streets to beverly hills high 
school in the span of a weekend smith says of medina who 
recommended that the fresh prince of rap music would be a 
natural tv character 
he saw my music video and never considered anyone else 
smith says

lonny price is doing double duty these days as 
director of the rothschilds and a star of falsettoland two 
offbroadway musical hits 
well maybe thats triple or quadruple duty hes also appearing 
on the television soap opera loving playing a district 
attorney and in whats left of his spare time hes trying to 
write several musicals including one about that celebrated 
catskills family the grossingers 
but every night youll see him down at the lucille lortel 
theater playing mendel the psychiatrist in falsettoland 
william finns acclaimed musical about coming to terms with life in 
the age of aids 
the lortel is a fiveminute walk from the circle in the square 
downtown where a revival of the rothschilds prices latest 
directorial effort is running 
when the rothschilds a musical about the famous european 
banking dynasty first opened in new york in 1970 it was one of 
the most lavish productions broadway had ever seen 
price first directed the show last winter offoffbroadway in 
the basement of a west side supermarket on a playing area no 
bigger than most new york bathrooms 
it was an impossible stage price says but thats the 
best thing about directing instead of worrying about how im 
doing i worry about how the actors are doing you become a problem 
solver it takes your mind off yourself 
the rothschilds was so successful it was moved to the larger 
theater and price has had to juggle a new career in the theater 
a field he has been passionate about all his life 
my mom was crazy for musicals he says so is her son 
price born in new york and raised in queens and new jersey saw 
his first broadway show at age 3 he sat on a couple of phone books 
to watch a saturday matinee of oliver 
if you dont want your little boy to be on stage dont take 
him to oliver price advises all those kids having such a 
good time up there 
he was the kind of starstruck teenager who took his bar 
mitzvah money some 3000 and put it in broadway musicals 
rather than savings bonds or electric guitars 
over a period of several years price and family invested in six 
shows on some like the angela lansbury revival of gypsy he 
made a little money on others like stephen sondheims pacific 
overtures he lost it all 
price has been writing fan letters to sondheim since he was 13 
after he saw company he was my absolutely favorite broadway 
composer price recalls he was like my mick jagger and 
sondheim wrote back even today they still correspond two or three 
times a year 
sondheim put price in touch with producer harold prince who 
gave him a job backstage working on pacific overtures a 
musical about the opening of japan to the west 
i copied scripts kept them up to date and did everything but 
get coffee price says 
the day before pacific overtures was to open on broadway 
the shows rickshaw was stolen price was told to stay at the 
theater and protect the set 
i was 15 and probably shorter than i am now he says i 
sat in the dark on the stage of the winter garden theater guarding 
the set now if anyone had come and taken anything i dont know 
what i would have done 
price eventually was fired from pacific overtures a 
volunteer job because one of princes assistants said the eager 
youth was asking too many questions 
but that didnt sour his enthusiasm for broadway 
he attended the performing arts high school in new york the 
school made famous by fame 
after that i went to juilliard for a year and dropped out 
and have been working ever since price says but he wanted to be 
an actor not a producer or director or someone behind the scenes 
price got a job in an offbroadway play called class enemy 
a drama about teenagers in londons east end the play ran for 
seven months and won him a theater world award as a promising 
newcomer 
he left to do the workshop of a new musical and was seen by 
sondheim who learned price could sing 
that may have helped him get a role in merrily we roll 
along an unsuccessful sondheim show that many consider one of 
the composers most accomplished scores 
it was the best time of my life price says you can 
understand from my background how much appearing in a sondheim 
musical meant to me prince and sondheim were my heroes getting 
them to write a song for me was great 
but it was also a painful difficult experience so much so that 
price hasnt seen any of the revivals of the musical that have 
played around the country in recent years the show played only 16 
performances in 1981 but lives on in a wonderful rca cast 
recording 
i would like to have grown in the role but the rug was pulled 
out from under us price says despite the musicals quick 
demise he never gave up the theater 
in fact price has turned down a halfdozen television shows 
over the years three in the last 12 months to continue to do 
stage work 
they offer me a lot of money to do something pretty dopey and 
i really dont want to do it i dont like sitcoms which is mostly 
what i get offered roles like the best friend of the hero or real 
nerds totally uninteresting except that you make enough money to 
never have to work again 
its a real challenge every time one of them rears its head 
but i say no id really rather be on stage or direct

stray sirereprise aztec camera 
 
aztec cameras excellent fourth album showcases the versatility 
of roddy frame the english groups songwriter singer guitarist 
and coproducer 
the nine songs on stray range from the melancholoy title 
ballad to jazzy instrumentals to the angry rock of good morning 
britain with exclash member mick jones 
the first single the crying scene is a gem that combines 
in one eminently danceable construction the albums two main 
themes the pain of love lost and the importance of pushing on 
through adversity 
after three spotty releases from aztec camera stray is a 
consistently strong album that shows why some of britains leading 
songwriters including elvis costello have long championed frame 
equals 
black sheets of rain virgin bob mould 
 
the title of bob moulds second solo album is a dead giveaway 
that it wont follow in the subtle melodic vein that made last 
years workbook such a big surprise 
black sheets has its gentle moments but it is mostly a dark 
brooding work dominated by moulds roaring vocals and swirling 
guitar 
the music sounds loud even when played at low volume an 
achievement that recalls moulds old thrash band husker du mould 
is again joined here by drummer anton fier of the golden palominos 
and pere ubu bassist tony maimone his sidemen on workbook 
moulds emotional intensity pierces through the noise making 
such songs as the environmental lament its too late and the 
lovers plea one good reason memorable 
black sheets of rain proves once again that mould is more 
than a big guy with a scary voice and a bunch of amplifiers the 
fruits of his uncompromising efforts may not always be sweet but 
they are consistently interesting

you can run your hands over the crazy quilt and 
twirl the propeller on the 19thcentury whirligig in an american 
folk art exhibit that is turning common museum practice on its 
head 
bringing folk art closer is the first exhibit created as 
part of access to art a program designed to make the arts 
available to all museum visitors the show now at the baltimore 
museum of art features examples of folk art in a variety of media 
pottery sculpture textiles furniture and painting it marks 
the first time any objects have been presented for touch in a major 
folk art exhibition 
the display an overview of american folk art is the brainchild 
of irma shore director of access to art she is losing her sight 
and believes a few steps can make many types of art available to 
people who are in wheelchairs deaf or visionimpaired 
the idea really was to create an exhibit that would be 
available to all ages and abilities shore said its not about 
people with disabilities or for people with disabilities but to 
create an exhibit that can be experienced by everyone 
touching enhances peoples understanding of art and art 
objects touching seems to draw people a lot closer to the objects 
i think it breaks down the barriers that people sometimes feel in 
an art museum 
the pieces of folk art were selected from a special collection 
at the museum of american folk art in new york when it leaves 
baltimore nov 11 it will travel to portland ore indianapolis 
louisville ky madison wis muscatine iowa new london conn 
huntsville ala halifax nova scotia and memphis tenn 
twentyseven of the 28 objects can be touched the display 
includes a late 18thcentury shaker rocker from upstate new york a 
bottlecap snake made in new mexico in 1985 and a lifesized wooden 
and plaster lumberjack that once served as a roadside sign 
the only display that is marked do not touch is an unsigned 
19thcentury portrait of a rural new england familys toddler 
rendered by an itinerant painter rural and middleclass families 
relied on these traveling painters for likenesses of their loved 
ones 
every object in the room is at a level that can be easily 
reached from a wheelchair the accompanying booklet is in large 
type and in braille for blind people or those with limited sight 
the audio tape for visitors describes each object including its 
colors and gives clear instructions about how to walk from one 
display to another in the room a written version is also 
available and can be used as an aid by deaf people 
each display features a white beam on the gray carpeted floor so 
blind people with canes will know when to stop because the beam is 
in stark contrast to the floor it aids those who have difficulty 
seeing 
a large laminated black and white photo is attached to each 
piece of art for close examination by those who have vision 
problems 
here is a list of exhibits and shows at some museums and 
galleries in the united states

with two hit movies now in the nations 
theaters matthew modine gets a few jumps toward the status that 
has so far eluded him stardom 
modine whose quiet manner and freshfaced looks conceal an 
inner intensity has delivered a variety of impressive performances 
since his debut in john sayles baby its you he has ranged 
from drama streamers birdy to action mrs soffel 
to warfare full metal jacket to comedy married to the 
mob 
he hasnt yet snagged that breakthrough hit that will elevate 
him to the multimilliondollar elite as big did for tom hanks 
and top gun for tom cruise 
modines two new films may help in pacific heights he and 
melanie griffith are homebuying yuppies whose dream is shattered 
by their vicious tenant michael keaton in memphis belle he 
is the world war ii b17 pilot who leads his crew through a final 
devastating mission 
the californiaborn actor was here from his new york home for 
the opening festivities for memphis belle he and other members 
of the b17 crew who include eric stoltz sean astin and harry 
connick jr underwent eight days of rugged basic training in 
england ending with a marine survival course 
modine hadnt experienced anything like it though by the end 
of full metal jacket i felt as if i had been through basic 
training he said 
the thing that was really good about it was something none of 
us could have anticipated when we were on the plane we werent 
going to see other members of the crew we were just communicating 
through headsets 
having gone through that boot camp allowed us to get to know 
each other not just to be able to identify another persons voice 
but to really know that individual during harsh difficult trying 
periods one gets to know another person quite well it became 
invaluable when we were on the plane 
memphis belle started out with a bang 5 million in the 
first weekend and pacific heights scared up 19 million in 17 
days despite tepid reviews 
about pacific heights he remarked was it fun well 
there was a lot of screaming and hollering and dumping of bugs in 
ones face but the nicest thing about it was working with melanie 
griffith i didnt really work with michael i was either yelling 
at him or beating him up melanie is a hard worker and she 
juggles a lot quite well family husband don johnson career 
the reason for the films success 
i see it as a metaphor for whats happening in society today 
we all live in a civilized community and have agreements with each 
other we agree that were not ging to steal from each other or 
take advantage of each other theres always someone who comes into 
this community who takes advantage of the good nature of other 
people its unfortunate 
like others of his acting generation tom hanks demi moore tom 
cruise etc modine had a traveling childhood the reason had to 
do with his father who was manager of drivein movie theaters a 
dwindling medium 
the cars were getting smaller and people werent going to 
theaters as much because of television he said kids could go 
to the playgrounds at the theaters then go back to the cars and go 
to sleep while the parents watched the movie but playgrounds were 
taken out because of the insurance costs 
driveins were always out in the middle of nowhere among 
apple and peach orchards but then the price of real estate went 
up id go back to the towns id lived in and i couldnt recognize 
them where my dog had been buried was a grand central parking lot 
our house and the drivein were just erased as though they had 
never existed 
modines future life came into focus when he saw a documentary 
about the musical oliver 
having come from this itinerant family i saw these children 
learning to sing and dance and it looked like fun he recalled 
i was always the new kid on the block here were these kids who 
were orphans in the script and they were learning the songs and 
dancing it seemed like a good family to be part of so i asked my 
father if i could take some tap dancing and singing lessons much 
to my surprise and enjoyment he said yes 
modine who lives in a greenwich village house with his wife and 
two young children agrees that a traveling childhood can be 
perfect training for future actors they study a wide range of 
human nature learn to adapt to new surroundings but he found a 
drawback 
i didnt get a proper education teachers let you slide a bit 
so you can catch up public schools are so crowded that teachers 
cant give you that special attention to let you catch up he 
said 
i didnt really read a book until i was working on a film 
playing a high school student i was sitting in a classroom and i 
saw the ernest hemingway book the old man and the sea it was 
one of the first books i read from cover to cover otherwise i was 
lying and cheating my way through school 
another result of his childhood he learned to say goodbye to 
friends film actors spend two or three months of intimate contact 
with fellow workers many of whom they never see again 
i value friendships very much says modine 30 one or 
two sometimes three people from each movie i work on i desperately 
try to keep in touch with i dont want to disregard those 
friendships just because the picture is over i want to continue to 
share and grow with them

a week after his 2200th performance opened the 
metropolitan operas fall season placido domingo has no intention 
of cutting back from the hectic schedule for which he is famous 
i do rest a lot more than people think the tenor said 
squeezing in an interview during a short break at a recording 
studio i continue at the right pace i pace myself well 
the right pace for domingo would kill many a lesser mortal he 
averages 90 performances a year in addition to recording albums 
he has over 70 and serving as an artistic consultant to the los 
angeles opera and the 1992 universal exposition in seville spain 
even as he talked aides interrupted him with questions while 
photographers who had planned on just a few minutes more to shoot 
his picture for an album cover bemoaned the loss of time 
tell him i have my hands full now the singer told an 
assistant who asked if he would speak the next day with abctv 
anchorman peter jennings 
when you have interviews or extra work ahh domingo 
shrugged somewhat sheepishly the singing is not so hard as all 
the extra things that come along 
but ask him how he plays rodolfo in la boheme or what its 
like making his first album with itzhak perlman or about his role 
as artistic consultant for expo 92 in seville then the strain of 
being one of operas most prolific stars melts away in the sheer 
joy of talking about opera music and domingos native spain 
the opening night performance was his 120th portrayal of 
rodolfo the brash young poet still the tenor says he enjoys the 
role relishing its blend of comedy and tragedy and the chance to 
don rodolfos bohemian mantle of youth 
its very good to have an element of comedy he says noting 
that most roles for his vocal range lean toward tragedy 
critics praised the chemistry between domingo and soprano 
mirella freni who played the frail yearning seamstress mimi even 
though the two had not previously performed together 
according to domingo how a role is acted in la boheme can 
be as vital to the performance as how it is sung the acting is 
very important how you play certain moments the interaction has 
to be very strong 
the spanish star says the ending of la boheme where mimi 
dies apparently from consumption is especially tricky for a tenor 
 
you can really spoil the ending so much tragedy is there 
its almost melodramatic he said if you go too far or stay 
too cool perhaps the atmosphere at the ending is not the right 
one 
the atmosphere at the recording studio where domingo joked as 
he and perlman posed for pictures was certainly the right one the 
asyet unnamed album under the angelemi label will feature some 
of the pieces made famous by the irish tenor john mccormack 
songs already recorded include elergie by massenent 
ideale by tosti the largo from xerxes by handel and 
barcarole from offenbachs the tales of hoffman 
domingo says some of his finest work however has come from 
behind the floodlights instead of in front of them 
we have five years of great results opera is happening in los 
angeles he declared not without pride we do all kinds of 
repertoire we have created fantastic company that didnt exist 
five years ago 
at expo 92 one of the main cultural highlights will be the 
production of every opera set in seville seven total including 
carmen the marriage of figaro the barber of seville 
and don giovanni 
our plans are quite spectacular he said reeling off the 
names of opera companies scheduled to perform in seville the met 
milan florence dresden stockholm vienna maybe los angeles or 
paris 
he doesnt stop there symphony orchestras are expected from 
london vienna leningrad israel and pittsburgh among other 
places 
the maestranza theater where many of the productions will be 
held is now under construction but plans to open this spring a 
year before expo 92 opens domingo a native of madrid says he 
will perform in seville but waved off further questions with a 
smile 
the spanish tenor well aware of frailities of the human body 
guards his instrument by not talking at all on the day of a 
performance he bends the rule somewhat on recording days 
recording you can redo you never do things the first time 
he said in the theater no one is going to help you you have to 
do it from beginning to end 
but the prospect of turning 50 this january doesnt faze him in 
the least 
its wonderful to arrive at 50 he smiled i am working 
with more energy than ever

age hasnt mellowed the high priest of punk 
iggy pop 
since his early days as the volatile leader of the stooges pop 
born james osterburg has been an angry man angry about lifes 
despair and angry at the state of rock music as he knows and loves 
it 
on his latest album brick by brick pop reiterates his 
anger from the viewpoint of someone whos seen it all and doesnt 
like much of what hes seen 
he blasts artists who fall victim to commercialism in main 
street eyes record company executives looking for new blood at 
any cost on my baby wants to rock and roll and yuppies who 
glorify the almighty dollar in starry night 
hes proud of his own integrity and selfrespect but knows hes 
in for a fight to keep those traits intact because as he says my 
head keeps trying to sell me ambition 
pop realized that he had to make a stand for the kind of music 
he believed in when he was dropped from elektra records in 1970 and 
was faced with making a career move that would have threatened that 
music he said the decision only made him more determined 
its when you say no at crisis times it strengthens your 
resolve and your selfrespect and at the same time it also makes 
it harder for you to get along in the big stream of things he 
said in a telephone interview 
i have corruptions as far as there are things that are not 
particularly glorious that i do to try to protect and promote the 
music that i do that i think is good but i try to keep the music 
part as pure as i can 
pure music according to pop is lifeaffirming 
its something that talks to your central nervous system about 
the fact that there was life before theres going to be life in 
the future and that really theres something a little more glorious 
here he said 
there are tender spots on brick by brick despite its anger 
candy a duet with kate pierson of the b52s lets him grieve 
over a longlost love but allows the woman in the form of 
pierson to state her mind as well and home is pops attempt 
to show that he is grateful for a life now rooted after years of 
instablity 
im saying that i value and need my home life and people that 
i actually can trust pop said 
i spent years and years totally and absolutely alone almost 
all the time and i couldnt let anybody get near me and thats how 
i wrote he said the only people i would know was my band and 
i kept them at quite a distance too 
that has begun to change but its never going to totally 
change maybe because partly thats my nature and partly because 
thats how ive gotten used to living but its changed quite a bit 
now 
guitarist slash and bassist duff mckagan from guns n roses are 
featured as musicians and cowriters on several tracks pop praised 
the band for its understanding of the punk attitude 
they really have the energy of a good punk band and 
lyrically that guy singer axl rose actually does what a good 
punk lyricist tries to do he said he describes whats bugging 
him no matter how out there it is and he describes whats going 
on around him faithfully 
pop tried to achieve his own directness on brick by brick 
both with music and with lyrics 
i want to be able to say more just basically about the 
landscape he said i have a lot id like to say and id like 
to be able to say it more succinctly 
i seem to be getting more articulate and also as i get older 
its like hey im gonna die anyway so im getting less afraid 
to come right out and say what i think whereas before i would 
kind of allude to it in metaphor 
despite its biting criticism brick by brick wasnt a 
protest album 
i protest a lot of stuff in it but if i was going to protest 
it it would be more like saying change it he said and i 
dont ever expect it to change so i just listed it 
as a selfdescribed fringe character pop said rock n roll 
is best played by someone on the outside of society 
to be done convincingly it rock requires a real outsider 
the kind of people who may not really be bad doomed is probably 
a better word he said with a laugh 
theres a sense of doom theres a sense of somebody thats 
outside the accepted rewards system half the morbid fascination of 
watching a rock career is usually when is he going to get punished 
for this behavior 
has he made it to that point 
i made it im really bad but i feel good inside he said

mario vargas llosa has said goodbye to the rigid 
world of politics to publish an erotic novel that caused him 
trouble during his quest for perus presidency 
few political hopefuls would admit to writing about an 
adolescents affair with his stepmother vargas llosa said he did 
not write in praise of the stepmother farrar strauss and 
giroux 1895 as a provocation its just that there was no 
reason for him to hide his literary views 
it was used against me in the campaign he said of the 
novel which is being released in english this month it was 
published last year in spanish 
announcers on television would warn people get your children 
out of the room then they would read sections of the book he 
said 
the book however did not cost him the election vargas llosa 
said a peruvianjapanese engineer alberto fujimori defeated him 
because of differences in their plans for perus bankrupt economy 
john updike called vargas llosas loss a gain for literature 
reviewing the novel in the new yorker updike said praise would 
have been a startling document in our erotically retrenched 
nation 
not only would an american presidential candidate not have 
written it but the national endowment for the arts wouldnt have 
given it a grant updike wrote 
in an interview from a 38thfloor hotel room overlooking 
manhattans central park vargas llosa said his life and works 
often got in the way of his short political career 
as a writer you are your own master the political life is 
very different bodyguards rigid schedules not having control of 
your life becoming very dependent it was a great effort just to 
get used to this 
vargas llosa said several of his earlier novels including 
conversation in the cathedral the green house or the 
real life of alejandro mayta advocated a more radical political 
change than his moderate political campaign offered 
in politics i think the reformist path is the best of all 
possible evils he said 
but not so in art i am for the excess in art i think it is 
important to open the door release all that is repressed in life 
it is very dangerous to do this in real life 
in praise of the stepmother tells the story of don 
rigoberto an artloving insurance executive his wicked but 
cherubic son alfonsito and the stepmother dona lucrecia 
chapters alternate between the destruction of the family and erotic 
fantasies based on paintings by titian jordaens and fra angelico 
the erotic world is a world in which you add art to the 
physical world he said so there are two levels in which the 
love relationship develops the realistic one and the imaginary 
one 
vargas llosa wrote it in 1987 and early 1988 and then got rid 
of it 
you write trying to create something that you dont know what 
it is until its finished you fight your own ghosts you find 
something that opens mysterious doors in your own personality 
updike called the book an impish and delicate yet fiercely 
serious work about the dark complexity of sex 
vargas llosas most popular novel aunt julia and the 
scriptwriter also dealt with a romantic relationship between a 
younger man and an older woman the author only smiled when asked 
about the role of past experiences in his writing 
a film version of aunt julia renamed tune in tomorrow 
and starring peter falk opened last month in us theaters it 
will broaden the authors exposure in the united states and vargas 
llosa said he was pleased with the adaptation 
they have changed the story and they have moved it from lima 
to new orleans but the atmosphere is quite similar i think it 
will do well 
however vargas llosa was uncertain how his new novel would fare 
in the complex american society 
on one hand there is something that is great in this society 
its freedom its possiblity to change things at the same time 
it is difficult to understand these movements to repress 
what is so obvious is that it is not books or art that corrupt 
men it is men who corrupt an idea by trying to censor it 
repression wont solve it it will just come out in more dangerous 
ways such as violence 
vargas llosa saying he would never again enter politics and 
staying out of peru since his electoral loss in june says he has 
salvaged something from his twoyear quest for the presidency 
material for his next novel 
i had this idea before going into politics how violence 
little by little can take over society this is something that 
fascinates and terrifies me violence has become the atmosphere in 
which the society breeds 
he mentioned the increase in drugs which has ripped apart 
societal structure in peru colombia and to a lesser extent 
much of the developed world 
in his twomonth runoff campaign against fujimori more than 100 
of his campaign workers were killed mostly by maoist shining path 
guerrillas intent on disrupting the elections 
when asked about a rand corp report predicting that the maoist 
guerrillas would take over peru within two years vargas llosa 
paused for a moment and leaned back on his sofa 
i wouldnt prophesize but you must recognize that the 
increase in violence is terrifying

country music pioneer hank snow who 
performed for american soldiers in korea and vietnam would be 
eager to entertain us troops in the persian gulf if he were 
younger 
the 76yearold snow established himself as one of country 
musics ambassadors by making several overseas tours to perform for 
us armed forces between 1950 and the mid1960s 
besides korea and vietnam snow also sang for military personnel 
in germany france norway italy england and japan 
if i was 20 years younger id jump at the chance to go over 
again said snow celebrating his 40th anniversary on the grand 
ole opry country music show 
ive seen what good it can do when we entertained over there 
before the amount of good you could feel you were doing made you 
want to go back they just needed a touch of home 
its one of the things that stays in my memory this was a 
great experience one that money couldnt buy it was the most 
important part of my life as far as entertaining is concerned 
while in korea he offered to write letters if soldiers would 
give him the names and addresses of their loved ones he expected 
to get a few hundred but 7000 were turned in when he returned to 
the united states a secretary was needed to send form letters to 
the soldiers relatives 
someone came up to me at the opry not long ago and thanked me 
for the letter i wrote to his mother snow recalled 
snow known as the singing ranger because he prefers cowboy 
attire has been a performer for more than 40 years 
rca records has just released the hank snow collectors 
series reissuing eight of his records bear records of germany 
is putting out every song he ever recorded this is a mammoth 
undertaking snow has sold an estimated 70 million records and made 
more than 100 albums 
his im moving on which he wrote was no 1 on the country 
music charts for almost a year in 1950 emmylou harris one 
generation younger brought it back with her version six years ago 
the song about boarding a train to leave a wayward lover has been 
recorded by about 60 other performers 
the hank snow collectors series includes im moving on 
his version of the pop music classic sentimental journey and 
today i started lovin you again which was a hit for kenny 
rogers 
snow has had more than 40 songs in the top 10 of the country 
music charts his heyday was the 50s and 60s 
he was born in liverpool nova scotia he left home at age 12 
and became a cabin boy on a freighter for four years as a 
teenager he used 30 in earnings from a twoweek stint unloading 
salt from a ship to buy his first guitar 
he moved to the united states in the 40s and began singing in 
dallas country music star ernest tubb helped him get a spot on the 
grand ole opry in 1950 and hes performed on the show ever since 
i think it gets in your blood snow said about the opry in 
an interview in his office at his modest home in suburban 
nashville 
sometimes you say im tired of going to the opry but if 
you didnt go over there and laid off for three or four weeks 
youd want to get back there again 
a proud and plainspoken man snow has been involved in several 
ontroversies during his long career 
in 1986 he had a dispute with cbstv and the opry he refused 
to appear on a tv special saluting the opry because he felt 
slighted when asked to sing only one verse of im moving on 
in another tiff he has said he lost 2 million to 3 million in 
royalties because he did not have an attorney and accountant to 
keep track of the amount due him from rca records he ordered an 
audit and feels it contributed to the fact rca dropped him from its 
recording roster in 1980 after 45 years under contract 
snow and col tom parker elvis presleys longtime manager 
operated a talent agency in the 50s and snow has long claimed 
that he was not compensated fairly as presleys agent 
looking back on his lengthy career snow is uncomfortable when 
called a legend or pioneer 
there are legends living legends dead legends and all that 
i dont go for that i appreciate it when people say im a pioneer 
but you have to earn that right

the company that brought the allpurpose 
swiss army pocketknife to america is now offering products that do 
more than open wine bottles strip wire or gut fish 
forschner group inc the us distributor of the multiblade red 
knives with silver crosses has expanded into the sunglass and 
watch business with its new subsidiary swiss army brands ltd 
the company is banking on consumers familiarity with the swiss 
army name to get these products off the ground 
there is a highquality imagery associated with the knife 
said forschner president james kennedy it has always been known 
as a useful utilitarian product and we were able to transfer that 
to the watchs image 
sales of the swiss army brand watch totaled around 4 million 
since its debut last fall double the projections said kennedy 
the simple watch with a large face big numbers and black strap 
was designed in the united states and manufactured in switzerland 
it sells for 95 retail 
the swiss army brand aviatorstyle sunglasses were introduced in 
april and sell for around 115 retail but sales have been 
disappointing thus far totaling just 385000 in the first nine 
months of this year kennedy said the glasses came out too late to 
be included in many retailers summer catalogs 
the new products are targeted at upscale outdoorsy types who 
frequent camping and hunting stores the company does minimal 
advertising and its products are sold by exclusive retailers such 
as hoffritz for cutlery eddie bauer and hammacher schlemmer 
the swissbased victorinox cutlery co founded in 1884 by karl 
elsener developed the original swiss army knife in 1891 its 
patent on the pocketknife expired in 1908 and since then many 
imitations have surfaced 
about half the soldiers in the swiss army carry victorinox 
knives the rest are manufactured by their rival wenger which 
also sells swiss army knives in the united states through retailers 
like k mart and l l bean 
victorinox makes 295 different models of the knife but 
forschner sells only about 50 in the united states 
the scientist model features a magnifying glass while the 
tinker contains two can openers and a phillips screwdriver a 
saw pliers scissors and a file are part of the craftsman 
forschner became a distributor for the pocketknives shortly 
after world war ii the company started out 135 years ago in new 
britain selling only butcher scales in the 1930s it added 
victorinox butcher knives to its line 
the butcher knives sold almost exclusively to slaughterhouses 
and restaurants accounted for 27 percent of forschners business 
last year another 23 percent came from swiss army knives printed 
with corporate logos the other half came from the pocketknives 
when kennedy came to work at the company in 1975 it decided to 
stop selling butcher scales and to halt sales of the pocketknives 
to its 40 wholesalers forschner began selling the pocketknives 
directly to specialty retail stores 
imitation knives have plagued forschner for years but when 
knockoffs of the watches started showing up in stores for 2025 
the company took immediate action against some asian manufacturers 
for violating trade laws 
since the knockoffs were not manufactured in switzerland the 
companies making them were not allowed to call them swissstyle or 
swisslike and were prohibited from using the trademark swiss 
cross 
such restrictions also have limited forschners growth 
we have to have all our products made in switzerland where 
the factories are small inefficient and expensive kennedy said 
he added that the strength of the swiss franc has added to his 
purchase price 
nonetheless in the past 16 years forschners profits have 
grown 4000 percent last year forschner sold 33 million worth of 
knives up from less than 1 million in 1974

holding the battle lines these days at chrysler 
corps headquarters is tough work 
executives of the financially struggling automaker are fighting 
on a number of fronts any one of which can explode in their faces 
profits are sinking talk of some sort of merger deal with fiat 
spa wont go away criticism for lacking a new midsize car 
persists in some quarters at least chairman lee iacoccas once 
magnetic personality is weakening 
but alls not dark and gloomy at the nations no 3 automaker 
chrysler has about 4 billion in cash to weather tough times 
much of the fiat speculation centers on joint production of a 
vehicle that would cut costs for both companies chryslers new 
minivan has been well received in showrooms the companys 
advertisements featuring iacocca stressing safety have coincided 
with increased american consumer demand for safe cars 
perhaps the companys most immediate problem is the united auto 
workers union on the surface the confrontation between chrysler 
and the union representing about 63000 of its hourly and salaried 
workers seems intractable 
the uaw vows there will be no deviation for chrysler from the 
contract it has reached with general motors corp and ford motor 
co some uaw members are wearing buttons saying pattern or 
picket 
chrysler insists the pattern agreement is too expensive the 
company wants relief from what it calls spiraling healthcare 
costs 
but as in most negotiations theres room to maneuver 
the issue here isnt concessions chrysler motors chairman 
bennett bidwell said in a recent interview the issue here is 
moderation 
can we have some flexibility and move the furniture around in 
a way that is both appropriate and proper for the uaw and its 
membership and constructive for the company he said 
chrysler is involved in a costcutting program begun in october 
1989 designed to remove 25 billion in costs by next june despite 
those reductions the company is expected to report later this 
month that losses during the third quarter will erase the 251 
million it earned in the first six months of this year 
the fourth quarter promises to be better but some wall street 
analysts are wondering whether chrysler will have made any money by 
yearend 
chrysler and fiat executives have acknowledged they are 
discussing a range of associations including joint development of 
the jj small sportutility vehicle vehicle distribution 
arrangements and a fiat investment in chrysler 
through the first nine months of this year fiat held 143 
percent of the western european new car market second only to 
volkswagen ags 151 percent third was peugeot sa of france at 
129 percent gm and ford european subsidiaries each held 117 
percent tied for fourth place 
chrysler held less than 1 percent of the market 
before fiat would consider buying part of chrysler fiat usa 
inc spokesman gualberto ranieri said the company has other more 
pressing projects including expansion into the emerging eastern 
european vehicle market 
fiats chairman giovanni agnelli has said the chryslerfiat 
talks must reach a conclusion soon possibly within a month 
chrysler spokeswoman karen stewart said earlier this month the 
company had no reaction to agnellis comments theres nothing 
new to report she said 
although the specific nature of any joint vehicle hasnt been 
announced its unlikely to be a new midsize car seen as badly 
needed by chrysler 
as plans stand now chrysler will bring out a new highvolume 
sedan codenamed lh in late 1992 for the 1993 model year 
company officials have said the lh is likely to look like the 
eagle optima car chrysler has been exhibiting at auto shows 
if that proves true it would point chrysler in a new design 
direction away from the officially dead but not gone kcars that 
helped pull the company away from bankruptcy in the early 1980s 
no matter what cars or trucks come off drawing boards chrysler 
still must sell them thats where iacocca comes in 
bidwell concedes iacoccas image may have slipped a bit in 
detroit and washington from overexposure chrysler research says 
thats not so elsewhere 
according to their research which is repetitive in dubuque 
iowa and places like that the image is still pretty good 
bidwell said 
in dubuque sales manager perry pickel of wilson brothers dodge 
agreed 
its not as strong as it was he said but i dont think 
it has lost as much as people think

shoneys inc is providing braille menus 
in 42 tennessee restaurants and if theres a demand plans to 
insert the special menus in its 715 restaurants across the country 
the concept is public service and public relations but if it 
generates a profit thats all right too company executives say 
making the notion work is another matter 
the difficulty in preparing braille menus in one place and 
sending them out is youll still have price variations prices in 
dothan ala might be a little cheaper than in new york city 
said oral miller executive director of the 40000member american 
council of the blind in washington 
mcdonalds introduced braille menus and largetype menus 10 
years ago and is updating the project 
mcdonalds didnt do a real good job at publicizing those 
menus as a result many blind people didnt know they existed in 
many cases when a blind person asked for it because the menu is 
such a rare thing many employees didnt know they had it miller 
said 
so its essential for the restaurant to keep the employees 
informed 
shoneys marketing director jeff sowell came up with the idea 
after talking with a visually impaired worker about placing orders 
in restaurants 
he said i know what i want or i take a sighted person with 
me sowell said 
problems arise when a busload of blind customers shows up at the 
family restaurant with only a driver or a couple other people who 
can see sowell said 
were just doing it in the middle tennessee right now as a 
test two menus at each location two for breakfast two for lunch 
and two for dinner he said 
the company spent less than 5000 to have the sixpage menus 
converted to braille produced at the tennessee school for the 
blind and delivered to the midstate restaurants 
shoneys executives will decide within three months whether to 
extend the braille menus nationwide 
i dont foresee us dropping it in this market because there is 
a large market in nashville for visually impaired people sowell 
said 
such menus will make ordering easier for many blind people but 
only 40 percent of the legally blind people in the country can read 
braille miller said 
a volunteer network based in austin texas sight through 
helping hands provides braille menus for some mcdonalds pizza 
hut and mr gattis restaurant groups along with restaurants in the 
marriott chain 
a group of students from tennessee school for the blind prepared 
the shoneys menus on computers and shoneys donated 1750 to the 
school for computer classes 
of course when you hear a menu theres no way in the world 
you can remember all the items and the prices so this is a way 
for them to read and feel more comfortable said harbans dhindsa 
the schools coordinator of special education

channel one the news network for students 
already has received mixed marks for running commercials now 
students at a high school here have staged a boycott against it 
after giving the news show a failing grade 
students feel channel one is just another kid show a senior 
high sesame street says fargo north high school principal ed 
raymond 
some 600 fargo north students took part in the twoday boycott 
of channel one last month by refusing to go to the classes showing 
the newscast the following week dozens took their concerns to the 
fargo school board the matter was referred to a threemember 
curriculum committee which is to make its recommendations tuesday 
channel one always has been controversial since whittle 
communications announced its plan to provide free video equipment 
to schools that agreed to air the daily television news program 
with two minutes of commercials wedged in each 10minute program 
gary belis a spokesman for whittle communications based in 
knoxville tenn says fargo north high school is an aberration 
out of 4000 schools on line this is the only one raising a 
protest he says 
raymond says the school which has 850 students needs the 
satellite dish central control panel and 36 video monitors whittle 
provides but some students say they feel they were used as a 
bargaining chip 
jared eide a senior at fargo north says students are eager to 
learn more about current events but channel one presnnts the news 
in 30second sound bites 
there are only 2 minutes of hard news says eide you get 
more out of reading the newspaper headlines 
student body president erika hovland voted in favor of channel 
one last spring after viewing a promotional program but she said 
its been a disappointment and she now wants to switch channels 
educational programming is also available from the public 
broadcasting service cable news network and other channels 
eide and hovland say students are willing to raise the 30000 
needed to replace the equipment if they are allowed a choice of 
programs 
a survey last spring by the fargo education association showed 
347 teachers opposed channel one and 109 favored it most like 
joan humphrey rejected its commercialism 
i just think its unethical to close the classroom door when 
commercials are being aired she says 
most channel one commercials get titters from humphreys senior 
english students an ad for acne medication gets a collective 
groan 
i think everyone would agree that programming without 
commercials is better than one with commercials belis says 
the problem is how do you pay for it 
eleven north dakota high schools in fargo bismarck and 
jamestown now tuning into channel one whittle recently approached 
the dickinson school district about becoming the 12th

oil prices should drop after the persian gulf 
crisis ends but probably will still wind up higher than they were 
before the invasion of kuwait says a survey of independent oil 
executives 
the survey released sunday also indicates independent 
producers are not changing their plans based on current oil prices 
twothirds of the 203 executives responding to the roper 
organization survey said they were somewhat optimistic about 
the longterm future of the petroleum industry while another 20 
percent said they were very optimistic 
seventythree percent of the executives said the gulf crisis 
will result in a permanent increase in the price consumers pay for 
oil 94 percent said the crisis will spur interest in nonoil 
energy sources and 97 percent said the demand for domestically 
abundant natural gas will increase because of the higher oil 
prices 
while 80 percent said the crisis would increase north american 
energy insecurity 66 percent of the executives said the conflict 
will not result in decreased use of oil from the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries cartel 
nevertheless the executives said the crisis hasnt changed 
their plans 
71 percent said they have not increased production since aug 
2 when iraq invaded kuwait and 73 percent said they had not 
increased capital spending 
80 percent said they have not changed strategic planning since 
the invasion 
the survey shows that though people are optimistic they 
havent changed their strategy because of whats happened in the 
middle east said grant porter a managing director of lehman 
brothers which sponsored the survey along with the independent 
petroleum association of america 
what the industry needs right now is stability porter said 
they are not making planning decisions based on 40 a barrel oil 
they may enjoy the cash flow but theyre not making plans 
asked where they thought the price of oil would stabilize once 
the crisis ends 38 percent said it would settle at 25 a barrel 
and 30 percent said it would return to between 21 and 24 a 
barrel a barrel holds 42 gallons of oil 
on friday the nearterm contract for light sweet crude the 
benchmark us grade fell to 3379 a barrel down 301 from 
thursday and 581 from a week ago 
the price which hit a record 41 a barrel earlier this month 
was less than 20 in july the month before the invasion 
porter said some people may be surprised at results showing that 
of the 92 executives who said their companies are reviewing new 
exploration areas as a result of the crisis 89 of them or 97 
percent were looking at the 48 contiguous states 
in other findings only 4 percent said they were considering 
expanding into alternative energy forms 
the survey was conducted by telephone in september and has a 
margin of error of plus or minus 7 percent 
the independent petroleum association of america meeting this 
week in dallas represents 10000 independent crude and natural gas 
explorers and producers independents drill about 85 percent of all 
wells in the united states and produce about 31 percent of the 
domestic oil and 60 percent of natural gas production

veterans of american bankers association 
conventions say the lavish social events have largely disappeared 
this year as the banking industry meets amid soft earnings in a 
weakening economy 
its more lets take care of business said one longtime 
conventioneer 
the attendance of about 4500 is down 18 percent from last year 
as some banks decided to forego the meeting to cut expenses 
there also are fewer exhibitors those who did come apparently 
are displaying a degree of frugality at a makeshift marketplace on 
the convention floor vendors selling modestlypriced items were 
doing far better than those with bigticket goods 
if they keep buying well have to make more said darlene 
george of newport richy fla who was selling linen and lace 
figurines 
but art labellman an orlando fur coat dealer said sunday hed 
yet to make a sale we had a lot of interest yesterday but no 
sales labellman said but were selling an expensive luxury 
item someones not going to spend 500 1000 2000 very 
quickly 
the banking industry has been racked by a spate of losses or 
reduced earnings caused in part by a decline in the economy and 
fallout from bad loans 
those problems are much on the minds of those attending the 
fiveday aba meeting which continues through wednesday 
but the word here repeated dozens of times over the first two 
days of the meeting is that banking is nowhere near the type of 
crisis that engulfed the nations savings and loan industry 
i think banks are concerned theyre trying to find every 
avenue they can to cut back said william s bushnell of 
danielson associates inc a consultant from rockville md 
but there are banks that are doing very well thank you 
said bushnell formerly a bank chairman in new hampshire like 
everything else in this world you hear about whos not doing 
well 
andrew c hove jr vice chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp told a session on sunday that bankers must 
emphasize to their customers that banking is much healthier than 
the sampl industry 
hove said that between 1985 and 1987 600 of the nations 2400 
thrifts had less than zero capitalization and those sampls were 
holding 300 billion in assets by comparison he said last year 
81 of the nations 13000 banks had negative capitalization and 
those banks had only 11 billion in total assets he said 
those are positive numbers hove said 
others are emphasizing that the banks are better capitalized and 
better regulated than the thrifts 
nevertheless the slumping economy makes many banks vulnerable 
said analyst alex sheshunoff of austin texas 
if we have a recession which it looks like were going to 
have it will have an even greater impact because the country is so 
overleveraged said sheshunoff president of sheshunoff amp co 
theres no room to simply go ahead and prime the pump by telling 
banks to lend some more money 
government regulation also is commanding the attention of the 
bankers with several seminars devoted to recent and expected 
changes in the system 
edward l yingling executive director of the abas government 
relations group said he expects at least a half dozen reform 
proposals to surface next year in congress 
yingling said sunday he anticipates major deposit insurance 
reform with new requirements for the amount of capital maintained 
by banks restructuring of e products and services rules changes 
in the sampl bailout legislation and a new interstate banking bill 
almost all the rules you are operating under could be changed 
in the next congress he said can something like this pass no 
one knows the answer to it theres going to be a real donnybrook 
in terms of the lobbying involved

its a late entry but boeing cos new 777 
jetliner should prove to be a strong seller and one of the 
aerospace giants key products over the next decade industry 
analysts say 
in my way of thinking its the forerunner of the planes of 
the 21st century says paul nisbet who follows boeing for 
prudentialbache securities in new york i think were in for an 
era of the big twins if you will 
the twoengine 777 second in size to boeings fourengine 
747400 is the first allnew design by the seattle planemaker in 
12 years boeing also says the aircraft may be the basis of a new 
family of jets and represents a change in philosophy in the way it 
develops planes 
last monday united airlines became the first to order the jets 
buying 34 777s and taking options on another 34 it also placed 30 
orders and took 30 options on 747400s if it buys all 128 planes 
the deal would be worth more than 22 billion the largest 
commercial jet purchase ever 
more orders may be on the way all nippon airways says it is 
considering the 777 for a possible 30plane purchase by the end of 
the year 
analyst howard rubel of cyrus j lawrence in new york said he 
expects boeing to receive about 100 777 orders in the near future 
nisbet said he thinks two or three orders may be placed by the end 
of the year and could help push the total value of boeings 1990 
orders to more than 50 billion a sixth consecutive record year 
still that would be only a beachhead in one of the most 
fiercely competitive markets in commercial aviation high capacity 
medium to longrange jets 
boeing thinks the market will be huge between now and 2005 it 
estimates 10000 commercial jets will be delivered with a total 
value of 626 billion in 1990 dollars a quarter of those planes 
will be largecapacity aircraft boeing says but will account for 
43 percent of the dollar value about 268 billion 
the first 777 is to fly in 1994 with deliveries to customers 
the next year that gives boeings two competitors mcdonnell 
douglas corp and airbus industrie a long head start 
mcdonnell douglas plans the first deliveries of its threeengine 
md11 by years end spokesman donald hanson says it has 173 firm 
orders from 32 customers for the plane a reworked successor to the 
dc10 
airbus has firm orders for 88 of its fourengine a340 and 129 of 
the twinengine a330 the a340 enters service in 1992 and the a330 
the year after spokeswoman sandy smith said 
the two models are basically the same design except for the 
number of engines the a340200 can carry 262 passengers in two 
classes 8600 miles the stretched a340300 can carry 295 people 
7700 miles and the a330 can take 335 passengers 5400 miles 
the md11 carries 293 passengers up to 8000 miles while the 
777 will haul 360390 passengers up to 4800 miles chris 
longridge executive vice president for sales for boeing commercial 
airplane group says it is studying a 300320 passenger version of 
the 777 with a range of 7200 miles 
all three manufacturers say they have the best planes all make 
advances in aerodynamics avionics and cabin design and will be far 
more fuelefficient and quieter than the dc10s and lockheed 
l1011s they aim to replace 
but boeing might have an edge by getting into the game late 
says analyst bill whitlow of gallagher capital corp in seattle 
with no deliveries until 1995 boeing should be able to produce 
a more modern and economical plane whitlow says 
nisbet agreed i think these big twins are going to be 
considerably more efficient and therefore more attractive he 
said i think the 777 is going to be the leader because of its 
size and expandability and its somewhat later technology 
the 777 will feature folding wingtips to fit in at more airport 
gates extensive use of lightweight composite materials and a 
highefficiency wing to let it take off with heavier loads under 
more adverse conditions 
longridge told a news conference last week he wasnt too 
concerned the plane will debut after his competitors 
the long lead time also dissipates shortterm concerns about 
high fuel costs longridge said airlines have been hurt by fuel 
prices nisbet said but if anything it should spur them to buy 
more efficient planes

communications co 
the l0year license agreements cover classic films in the united

rocky through rocky iv series 
tbs and pathe did not release the value of the agreements

the 1986 purchase of the mgm catalogue 
the deal hinges on pathe completing its purchase of mgmua 
so far pathe has paid 353 million toward the purchase price of 
about 13 billion questions still surround how pathes principal 
giancarlo parretti will finance the remaining 900 million 
the license agreements will allow tbs to show the films 
exclusively for 10 years on its cable television channels wtbs 
superstation and turner network television 
in addition to the james bond and rocky movies the agreements 
cover movies such as rainman a fish called wanda

congressional negotiators reached a tentative 
agreement today on a wideranging clean air bill that will require 
factories automakers and utilities to cut pollution dramatically 
over the next decade 
the legislation which toughens federal air pollution laws for 
the first time in 13 years was expected to be formally approved by 
a housesenate conference possibly later today and then go back 
to the two chambers for endorsement 
the bills controls aimed at cutting urban smog and ridding the 
air of millions of pounds of toxic chemicals are expected to touch 
on almost every sector of industry and cost the economy between 22 
billion and 25 billion when all its provisions go into effect 
under the legislation pollution from automobiles would be cut 
30 percent to 60 percent oil companies would be required to 
provide cleaner gasoline industries would reduce the amount of 
toxic chemicals released into the air and about 100 cities would be 
ordered to meet federal air quality standards 
the compromise bill retains a fiveyear 250 million aid 
program for workers who lose their jobs because of tougher 
pollution controls the white house had objected to financial 
assistance and had threatened to veto the bill if it were included 
but the administration appeared to soften its opposition to the 
provision after language was included to keep the program from 
becoming too costly 
white house aides when departing from the talks did not repeat 
their veto threat and congressional sources said they doubt 
president bush would scuttle the longsought clean air legislation 
on that jobloss assistance issue 
congress began considering the clean air measure more than a 
year ago 
agreement on the last sections of the massive bill which covers 
nearly 700 pages came as house and senate negotiators worked 
through most of night sunday and much of the early morning today 
congressional leaders had wanted a bill by the end of the weekend 
to give it enough time to clear congress before adjournment friday 
negotiators reached agreement early sunday on steep pollution 
cuts from electric power plants to reduce acid rain coalburning 
power plants in 21 states will be directed to cut their sulfur 
dioxide releases almost in half reducing annual emissions by about 
10 million tons by the year 2001 
the acid rain provision which will hit utilities and consumers 
of electricity in the industrial midwest the hardest was the last 
major section of the bill to be resolved agreements had been 
reached previously that cut smogcausing emissions from automobiles 
and toxic chemical releases from factories and businesses 
were getting real protection it meets the acid test on acid 
rain said rep gerry sikorski dminn a leading proponent of 
acid rain curbs 
the housesenate conferees struggled since midjuly to resolve 
differences in separate bills approved earlier by the house and 
senate 
for weeks there was only modest progress but the pace quickened 
in recent weeks with tentative agreements on key sections of the 
massive and technically complex legislation among the major 
provisions 
utilities must reduce their annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 
10 million tons or nearly in half by installing scrubbers or 
switching to lwsulfur coal they also must cut nitrogen oxides 
which also contribute to acid rain 
about 100 cities now considered to have unhealthy air must 
meet federal air quality standards within five to 15 years 
depending on the severity of the problem by reduce smogcausing 
emissions los angeles is given 20 years 
industry must install new pollution control equipment to cut 
the release of toxic chemicals into the air by 90 percent over the 
next decade only the steel industrys coke ovens would be given 
more time until 2020 even stronger pollution control measures 
could be required if the environmental protection agency concludes 
that residents near a plant are not ensured an amble margin of 
safety from the risk of cancer 
pollution from automobiles must be cut 30 to 60 percent 
through additional controls on tailpipe emissions and the phasein 
of alternative fuel vehicles in fleets a california pilot program 
also would require 300000 personal cars powered by alternative 
fuels by 1999 it could be copied by other states 
oil companies must provide cleaner gasoline blends in cities 
with the worst smog problems the requirement is aimed at pushing 
the sale of reformulated gasoline or blends that include 
additives such as ethanol 
the measures affecting factories thousands of small businesses 
automobiles and electric rates are acknowledged to be expensive 
but environmentalists argue much of the cost will be offset by 
savings in health care because of the cleaner air 
the controls on acid rain are expected to hit hardest in the 
industrial midwest where electric utilities have the dirtiest 
plants because of their heavy reliance on highsulfur coal 
in final bargaining midwest lawmakers gained some additional 
credits that will ease the cost of installing new pollution 
devices especially over the first five years negotiators 
however rejected efforts by the utility industry to roll back the 
sulfur dioxide reductions substantially according to congressional 
sources 
early today the house and senate negotiators also agreed to 
impose for the first time air pollution restrictions on offshore 
oil rigs an issue pressed by california lawmakers rigs off the 
gulf of mexico however are exempt 
meanwhile a requirement to regulate visibility in federal parks 
was taken out of the bill several western senators had threatened 
to block the legislation on the senate floor if it contained the 
visibility provision the compromise calls for park visibility to 
be studied

egypt cut its oil export prices by 6 a 
barrel on monday reflecting a possible easing in the persian gulf 
crisis 
it was egypts largest drop since the crisis began with iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the reduction was the second in two days and brought egypts 
prices 12 a barrel below levels a week ago prices last month 
reached close to 40 a barrel 
a senior oil ministry official said the drop reflects the 
increasing possibility of a peaceful end to iraqs occupation of 
kuwait 
he also said prices were driven down by indications that iraqi 
president saddam hussein is ready to release some foreign hostages 
held in iraq and kuwait 
the new prices are 2630 a barrel for the topquality khalig 
elzeit and ras elbihar 26 a barrel for the benchmark gulf of 
suez 2515 a barrel for belayim 24 a barrel for ras badran and 
2370 a barrel for ras ghareb

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
repeating a call he has made the last two years told bankers at 
their annual convention today they must increase their capital base 
if the industry is to thrive 
greenspan declined to use the forum of the american bankers 
association convention to deliver any major policy statement he 
left the orange county convention center immediately after his 
speech and refused to answer reporters questions 
he said capital was a key to survival in the hightech age 
during the past year as events have unfolded around the 
world we have been continually reminded that capital is critical 
to the stability and competitiveness of the banking industry 
greenspan said in an address that primarily focused on the history 
of checkclearing technology 
greenspans call for more capital repeated a theme he has 
brought to the past two aba conventions and echoed concerns on the 
matter that have been expressed here during the first three days of 
the fiveday gathering 
greenspan said changing technology has broad implications for 
the banking business he said developments will eventually give 
banks more competition 
the creation and delivery of financial services appear to 
depend to a greater and greater extent on technology that will not 
be the exclusive preserve of any single firm or industry 
greenspan told the bankers he said if competing businesses have 
equal footing in technology a strong capital base could be the 
factor that ensures survival 
business may well flow to firms that can combine these 
services with efficient and low cost access to credit and credit 
markets greenspan said this in turn will require a strong 
capital base

union carbide corp announced today 
thirdquarter earnings fell 35 percent due to rising energy prices 
and a soft market for chemicals 
the company said it earned 91 million or 63 cents a share on 
sales of 22 billion in the three months ended sept 30 that 
compared with earnings of 139 million or 98 cents per share on 
sales of 21 billion for the same 1989 period 
the earnings loss was partly blamed on rising prices of energy 
used to produce chemicals said robert d kennedy chairman of 
union carbide the cost of crude oil and other fossil fuels has 
risen sharply since the persian gulf crisis began in august 
union carbide primarily uses liquid natural gas to produce its 
chemicals spokesman thomas f sprick said although some of its 
plants are equipped to use oil 
kennedy said the price for raw materials and general economic 
weakness will result in further pressures on margins and the need 
for continuing controls on capital spending and costs 
he said thirdquarter earnings included a nonrecurring gain of 
14 cents per share from the sale of the polysilicon business of 
union carbides chemicals and plastics company inc to komatsu 
electronic metals c ltd the gain was partly offset by 
nonrecurring charges totaling 7 cents per share associated with 
several costreduction programs 
in addition costs associated with a power outage at union 
carbides taft la site were estimated at 4 cents per share 
for the first nine months of 1990 earnings dropped 43 percent 
for that period earnings totaled 301 million or 210 cents a 
share on sales of 65 billion that compared with earnings of 
526 million or 374 a share on sales of 66 billion for the 
same 1989 period

the united states a widelywatched drilling industry index said 
monday 
the toolmaker baker hughes inc reported the latest count 
compared with the yearago tally of 992 
baker hughes has kept track of the rig count since 1940 the 
count represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil not 
those producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
in the most recent total texas gained 17 rigs while oklahoma 
and new mexico each increased by nine 
north dakota showed the biggest decline of six

congressional and white house negotiators 
resumed their search for compromise over new taxes on the rich and 
cuts in medicare benefits today hoping to end their budget 
stalemate by weeks end 
a weekend of dickering at the capitol left bargainers ready to 
boost gasoline taxes by at least a nickel a gallon negotiators 
also seemed closer together on proposals for medicare cuts and 
taxing the wealthy 
the meetings also featured a welltimed walkout by an unusually 
talkative white house chief of staff john sununu but this morning 
administration budget director richard darman returned to the 
deficitreduction talks on capitol hill 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
today that sununu and darman left sundays session to return to the 
white house to brief the president upon his return from a weekend 
at camp david 
he said sununus hasty departure did not signify white house 
pessimism or a new impasse 
fitzwater insisted that the white house aides were no longer 
part of the direct negotiations but were only there as 
advisers so conferees will know whats acceptable to the white 
house this is a matter between the house and senate 
negotiators he said 
the mampm problem still remains house budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif said today referring to 
disagreements over taxing millionaires and cutting medicare 
its a very difficult negotiation rep dan rostenkowski 
dill chairman of the taxwriting house ways and means committee 
said as talks among congressional leaders ended late sunday our 
problem is trying to put something together that passes both 
houses 
lawmakers planned to resume their search today for a compromise 
package that would also satisfy president bush and allow congress 
to go home for the year by weeks end 
narrowing one important dispute democrats agreed to accept a 
nickel increase in the 9centagallon gasoline tax two cents less 
than republicans wanted the senate last week approved a ninecent 
boost but the house insisted on no change 
divisions remained over how much new taxes the rich should pay 
but the two sides seemed to be nearing an understanding amazing 
progress considering bushs opposition to any tax increases just a 
few months ago 
both sides were willing to boost the marginal rate on the 
wealthiest americans families with incomes above 180000 a year 
to 31 percent up from the current 28 percent and each party was 
willing to limit the deductions that people earning more than 
100000 can claim 
but a big gap existed over a democratic demand to levy an 
additional 75 percent surtax on those with incomes above 1 
million republicans said they would not accept the plan and 
instead offered a proposal rejected by democrats to reduce 
deductions on incomes above 1 million by 8 percent 
in addition republicans wanted to lower from 33 percent to 31 
percent the tax rate on families with incomes between 80000 to 
180000 democrats opposed the idea 
negotiators also moved closer to each other on medicare 
democrats would restrain the growth of the program by about 44 
billion over the next five years republicans want the cuts to be 
3 billion deeper 
about onefourth of the reductions would be borne directly by 
the 33 million handicapped and elderly people who use the program 
rostenkowski said the two sides were less than 2 billion apart on 
the precise cut to be aimed at beneficiaries 
democrats also want to boost the 51300 wage cap from which 
medicare taxes are deducted to 125000 republicans would increase 
the cap to 98000 the 145 percent medicare tax is part of the 
social security deduction 
the final plan also is certain to include higher taxes on 
cigarettes alcohol luxury items such as furs and airline tickets 
elements that were in separate bills the house and senate passed 
last week 
also destined for the final bill were cuts in crop payments to 
farmers new fees for federal environmental tests and coast guard 
services and stingier benefits for retired civil servants and 
veterans 
sunday afternoon speaking to reporters just in time to make the 
evenings network news programs the usually gruff sununu 
complained that democrats were dawdling rather than responding to 
the administrations offer to raise taxes on the nations 
highestincome people 
were not going to negotiate with democrats who cant come to 
an agreement among themselves he said as he left the capitol 
with white house budget chief richard darman and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady this was a great offer 
top republican lawmakers agreed with senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan saying these important negotiations have reached 
an impasse 
but shortly after the gloomy gop assessments congressional 
leaders from both parties resumed bargaining in doles office 
the deficitreduction bill combined with other savings mainly 
defense cuts and reduced interest payments on the debt would 
lower the deficit by 40 billion for the 1991 fiscal year that 
began oct 1 and another 460 billion over the next five years

co stock until nov 30 keeping alive the first hostile takeover 
effort involving two major us utilities 
kansas city power and light is offering 27 a share for the 
stock 
the company said that as of the expiration of the previous 
tender period on friday 47 percent of kansas gas and electrics 
common stock had been tendered that is an increase from the 437 
percent pledged when the previous tender period expired sept 14 
turner white kansas city power and light spokesman said last 
week he expected the number of shares tendered to decrease this 
latest period because state and federal regulatory agencies have 
set 1991 hearings on the takeover meaning there is no rush to make 
tender decisions 
white has said the large percentage of shares tendered is a 
message from kansas gas and electric stockholders urging the 
utility to drop its refusal to negotiate with kansas city power and 
light 
kansas gas and electrics position remain unchanged were not 
really sure what the numbers mean said lyle koerper kansas gas 
spokesman 
he said kansas gas and electric still contends the offer is 
inadequate and illegal he said the utility is negotiating with a 
third party and exploring all its options including remaining 
independent

weakening of the us dollar which makes american products cheaper 
overseas and a lower effective tax rate

to 101 billion or 457 a share up from 952 million or 429

two house agriculture committee subcommittee 
chairmen said monday they oppose a chicago board of trade plan to 
double the number of grain and soybean futures contracts available 
to speculators 
rep dan glickman dkan said such changes should not be made 
until the effects of the 1990 farm bill are known 
the bill which establishes new planting options as part of 
government budget cuts will dramatically change the commodities 
market said glickman chairman of the wheat soybeans and feed 
grains subcommittee 
he and rep glenn english dokla whose subcommittee oversees 
the commodity futures trading commission have asked the commission 
to withhold approval of the chicago board of trade plan until next 
year 
the farm bill has been approved by a housesenate conference 
committee but awaits final votes in both chambers and the 
presidents signature 
congress is expected to recess at the end of this month 
glickman and english said at the very least we do not believe 
the commission should take final action on this proposal while 
congress is in recess 
in a letter to commission chairwoman wendy gramm the 
congressmen said the chicago board of trade plan appears to be 
response to pressure from big commodity trading fund managers 
the funds have little interest in the price discovery or 
legitimate hedging functions of these markets and view them simply 
as another speculative venture to market to their customers the 
congressmens letter said 
we do not believe the commission should approve the proposal 
until its proponents can verify with certainty that it will enhance 
the performance of these markets and allay fears that it will 
simply subject grain producers marketers and users to 
unnecessary damaging price fluctuations the letter said 
critics fear the change adopted by the chicago board of trade 
directors would make the commodities market even more volatile than 
it is currently they say the increased price uncertainty could be 
costly to farmers and others who deal on the exchange to hedge 
inventories and setting prices of produce

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed 
monday on the chicago board of trade influenced by seasonal 
harvest pressure rumors of soviet grain purchases and volatile 
outside markets 
dry conditions were expected to continue for most of the week in 
the midwest where the corn and soybean harvest is believed to be 
near the halfway point analysts said 
rumors of soviet buying interest in us corn and soybeans 
provided modest support to those markets 
but a steep drop in crude oil and petroleum prices on the new 
york mercantile exchange tended to defuse inflation fears which 
helped limit gains in grain prices analysts said 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 263 a bushel corn 
was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 230 a bushel 
oats were cent to 1 cents higher with december at 124 a 
bushel soybeans were cent lower to 5 cents higher with november 
at 611 a bushel

bankers hands could be tied in the coming 
year by lawmakers bent on correcting the mistakes that led to the 
savings and loan crisis a top industry official said monday 
kelly holthus outgoing president of the american bankers 
association warned his colleagues of congressional overreaction in 
a farewell speech to the organizations annual convention 
the temptation for congress to take drastic measures in the 
current political environment is strong said holthus whose term 
expires tuesday 
all of us will have to work hard to make sure that commercial 
banks are not tarnished by the sampls record otherwise well 
surely find ourselves the victims of misguided legislation 
leaders of the banking industry say they expect a rash of 
legislation affecting their industry in the next congress and at 
this weeks aba convention they are firing up the lobbying machine 
its up to us to make sure that in politicians zeal to 
correct a wrong the banking industry doesnt end up battered 
instead holthus said 
several of the nations top banks are having trouble because of 
the slowdown in the economy and fallout from bad loans but those 
attending the aba meeting are going to great lengths to distance 
themselves from the thrift ind yearly 
ninetyfive percent of this package essentially is demanding 
serious sacrifice from everyone else veterans government 
employees working families said house budget committee chairman 
leon panetta dcalif we think its fair to let millionaires pay 
their fair share 
but gop senators were ardently against the idea arguing that 
imposing a surtax on some taxpayers would invie boosts later on 
for everyone after days of bargaining democrats were considering 
other plans which house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
described as infinitely changeable 
the two sides were entertaining similar offers in other 
unresolved areas 
they seemed near agreeing that the 9centpergallon gasoline 
tax would increase by a nickel or perhaps slightly more and while 
democrats wanted to reduce the growth of medicare by about 44 
billion over the next five years republicans wanted to slash to be 
about 3 billion deeper 
but participants emphasized that nothing had been settled in 
either of those areas democrats were saying the more taxes they 
could raise from the wealthy the milder the medicare reductions 
would be 
m and m is still the problem millionaires and medicare 
panetta said 
there were even hints that the gasoline tax might not be raised 
at all 
rep dale kildee dmich said gephardt told him it would be 
difficult for democrats to achieve the 10 percent surtax on the 
wealthy but indicated it might be possible to leave the gasoline 
tax alone 
last year 65000 families reported earning more than 1 million 
on their incometax returns boosting tax rates on the wealthiest 
people would mean an increase for 600000 families 
bargaining was also continuing over raising the 51300 ceiling 
below which the 145 percent medicare tax is deducted from 
paychecks democrats want to boost the cap to 125000 republicans 
to 98000 
the bill when completed would be the cornerstone of 500 
billion worth of savings over the next five years the rest of the 
deficitcutting would come from restraining the defense budget in a 
separate bill and from savings from projected payments on the 
national debt 
white house budget chief richard darman was in the capitol 
monday participating in the talks on sunday white house chief of 
staff john sununu and other administration officials left the 
meetings complaining that democrats were not responding to gop 
offers the meetings went on without them

time warner inc said monday it lost 91 million 
in the third quarter due to the heavy costs associated with the 
media and entertainment giants merger last year 
but the company said that excluding interest taxes 
depreciation and amortization costs thirdquarter earnings were up 
4 percent from comparable results a year earlier 
the quarter included record operating results from its filmed 
entertainment recorded music cable television and hbo programming 
units 
operating results fell slightly in magazines for the quarter due 
to losses at the new entertainment weekly magazine while operating 
earnings tumbled in books because of the absence of a contribution 
from scott foresman and co the textbook publisher sold last 
december 
for the quarter ended sept 30 time warner lost 405 a share 
in contrast to a loss of 124 million or 462 a share on a pro 
forma basis a year earlier interest depreciation and amortization 
costs amounted to more than 600 million in the latest quarter 
the pro forma results for 1989 indicate what time warner would 
have lost had time inc owned all of warner communications inc for 
the full year time bought a 593 percent interest in warner in 
july 1989 and acquired the remainder of warner this past january 
revenue for the quarter rose 9 percent to 29 billion from 
266 billion a year earlier 
ed atorino who follows time warner for the investment firm 
salomon brothers inc said the results showed a very solid 
operating performance 
although they lost a lot of money the operating numbers were 
very encouraging even for the magazine group he said 
in magazines time warner said it had operating earnings of 38 
million compared with 41 million a year earlier the division 
would have had record results as well despite the depressed state 
of the magazine advertising market company executives said had it 
not been for losses at entertainment weekly the magazine of 
entertainment reviews and features launched in february 
the company failed to say how much the startup magazine lost in 
the quarter but atorino said company executives told analysts that 
seasonal factors produced a slightly larger loss than expected for 
the quarter he said the company previously had projected a 50 
million loss on the magazine for the year or about 125 million 
per quarter 
other magazines in the group are time life people sports 
illustrated and fortune 
operating profit in the book division fell to 16 million from 
66 million in the quarter a year ago when scott foresman 
contributed profits of 57 million to the total 
operating earnings climbed 36 percent to a record 140 million 
in filmed entertainment for the quarter bolstered by record 
domestic syndication revenue that included sales of the tv shows 
head of the class alf and perfect strangers 
in recorded music and music publishing time warner has record 
operating earnings of 109 million up from 108 million a year 
earlier led by domestic releases from keith sweat acdc and faith 
no more 
the cable tv group had record operating earnings of 198 million 
in the quarter up from 165 million a year earlier and the 
programminghbo division had record operating earnings of 45

crude oil prices plunged a record 541 a barrel 
in heavy trading monday on a combination of middle east peace 
hopes technical trading factors and a report of an apparition 
appearing to saddam hussein in his sleep 
the drop in the november contract for light sweet crude oil to 
2838 per barrel marked the biggest singleday drop since futures 
contracts began trading on the new york mercantile exchange in 
1983 the previous record was a 4abarrel decline on aug 17 the 
merc said 
but the sudden erosion of the socalled war premium may not 
show up at the gas pump anytime soon analysts said it would take 
anywhere from three to 14 days for price movements to be passed 
along to consumers presuming the downward trend continued 
analysts cautioned that mondays decline might have been 
exacerbated by the expiration of the november contract activity 
typically is volatile ahead of a contracts expiration as dealers 
try to settle their accounts 
the november crude contract which had traded above 40 lost 
650 a barrel last week the last time the nearterm contract 
traded below 29 was in the second week of september 
other contract months fell 3 a barrel the limit for contracts 
beyond next month because the difference in the decline between 
those contracts and the november contract was so great traders are 
expecting prices to fall further at tuesdays opening 
prices for refined products traded on the merc also plummeted 
the november contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline which lost 
922 cents last week fell 1141 cents to settle at 7650 cents a 
gallon 
the contract for home heating oil for current delivery declined 
1242 cents to settle at a 7598 cents a gallon after losing nearly 
17 cents last week the november contracts for refined products do 
not expire until next week 
oil prices began tumbling in europes energy pits and opened 
sharply lower in new york as markets reacted to comments by saudi 
arabian defense minister prince sultan who suggested that arab 
countries were willing to grant iraq all its rights 
market observers called sultans comments the most conciliatory 
since the crisis began with iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
his comments were interpreted as a sign that saudi arabia was 
prepared to agree to kuwait ceding some land to iraq 
traders pushed prices lower on the belief that this development 
might lead to a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis 
unconfirmed rumors continued to tweak the market one had iraq 
pulling back its troops while a more outlandish report appearing 
in a kuwaiti newspaper said iraqi president saddam was inclined to 
withdraw from kuwait because the prophet mohammed instructed him to 
do so in a dream 
between saddams dream and increasing supply and declining 
demand the market is weaker than the oakland as said peter 
beutel an analyst with pegasus econometric group inc of hoboken 
nj 
on the fundamental side the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries said oil production in september was 227 million barrels 
a day or about 200000 barrels a day higher than previous 
estimates according to the cyprusbased newsletter the middle east 
economic survey 
production at that level fully compensates for the shortfall 
created by the loss of iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
the market has been in a downward mood for the past week and a 
half but the general consensus is that it will find 
support jim fiedler a vice president at edf amp man 
international inc 
despite the drift lower fiedler said there remains a hefty 
amount of skepticism that weve got peace breaking out overnight 
as long as saddams in power 
in natural gas trading the november contract closed at 1970 
per 1000 cubic feet up from 1900 on friday

the persian gulf crisis will mean billions 
of dollars in higher oil revenues to the opec nations britain and 
the soviet union but eastern europe and the third world will 
suffer a top un official said monday 
a sharp rise in oil prices has darkened the prospects for 
global growth and hit the oilimporting developing countries and 
eastern europe particularly hard said rafeeuddin ahmed the 
undersecretarygeneral for international economic and social 
affairs 
oil prices have risen sharply since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait driving the price per barrel to about 40 earlier this 
month prices tumbled monday below 30 but their longterm 
direction remains unclear

countries expecting to pay 30 billion for oil in 1991 will instead 
face bills of 45 billion to 60 billion ahmed told the general 
assemblys second committee which deals with economics

us commerce secretary robert mosbacher and his 
mexican counterpart jaime serra puche on monday began a fivecity 
tour to promote a proposed usmexico free trade agreement that 
would eliminate trade barriers between the countries 
the pair told 300 houston business and civic leaders attending 
the first full day of the traveling seminar on us and mexico 
business alliances that the free trade agreement could enhance 
economic opportunities for both countries and make north america 
more competitive with the european economic community 
canada reached a similar agreement with the united states two 
years ago and is considering joining the proposed alliance as a 
trilateral agreement 
this is a winwin situation mosbacher said we will be 
creating more jobs and more business on both sides of the border 
he said there will be more us jobs in the form of management 
teams and business owners and investors as well as complimentary 
firms in the united states while mexico will benefit with more 
jobs less outward migration and a more structured economy 
the growth in mexico is likely to produce increased demand for 
us goods mosbacher said he estimated us exports to mexico 
could rise from 52 billion last year to 100 billion by the year 
2000 
but he said that increase would depend on the approval of the 
agreement by mexico over the next two years and in the coming 
months in congress 
if all goes well we can hope to have an agreement in force by 
early 1993 mosbacher said he predicted such a pact would 
produce a combined output 36 percent more than the entire ecs 
serra said recent advancements in mexico to stabilize the 
economy by reducing trade tariffs have laid the basis for serious 
negotiations for an alliance 
in 1982 mexico was one of the most closed economis of the 
world and today mexico is one of the most open economies of the 
world serra said he noted the nations more relaxed trade 
restrictions that dropped import licensing requirements for 100 
percent to less than 2 percent of imports during that period at 
the same time the maximum tariff dropped from 100 percent to 20 
percent encouraging more import investments 
serra said mexico also has allowed twothirds of its firms to be 
100 percent open to foreign ownership dropped its effective tax 
rates to encourage business development and cut regulations on its 
transportation and shipping industries 
in mexico we are committed to becoming a worldclass 
competitor serra said 
mexico is the united states third largest trading partner 
behind only canada and japan 
from the beginning of this century the us has been mexicos 
biggest trading partner serra said 
the road show as mosbacher and serra call their series of 
information seminars will continue in dallas new york chicago and 
los angeles in the next four days

gold futures prices fell monday on new yorks commodity

contract for spot delivery at 36960 a troy ounce silver ended 
64 cents to 69 cents lower with the spot contract at 4194 a 
troy ounce 
gold and oil prices often move in sync because precious metals 
are considered a safe haven when oil is rising but gold did not 
respond as strongly to oils recent gains as many observers 
expected it would and on monday gold did not fall as sharply as 
the conventional wisdom would dictate 
in oil trading on the new york mercantile exchange the contract 
for november delivery of light sweet crude oil fell 541 to 
2838 a barrel in the markets sharpest move since crude oil 
futures began trading in 1983 
the previous record move was a 4abarrel drop on aug 27 
other crude oil futures tumbled 138 to 3 a barrel 
crude oils loss combined with a 301 decline on friday 
represented a 23 percent drop in the nearterm delivery price in 
just two days during the same period the spot gold price fell 50 
cents or a little more than 1 percent 
frederick demler metals analyst with painewebber inc said 
golds performance indicates the gold market never perceived 
40abarrel crude oil as a sustainable price 
he said the fact that gold prices did not collapse along with 
oil was bullish overall for the gold market 
oil prices plummeted amid increasing speculation that the 
standoff in the persian gulf is moving toward a peaceful 
resolution 
the selloff was prompted in part by a kuwati newspaper report 
that iraqi leader saddam hussein told top aides the prophet 
mohammed told him in a dream that his missiles were pointed in the 
wrong direction 
wholesale heating oil futures settled 6 cents to 1242 cents 
lower on the new york merc with november at 7598 cents a gallon 
wholesale unleaded gasoline ended 6 cents to 1141 cents lower with 
november at 7650 cents a gallon 
livestock and meat futures fell on the chicago mercantile 
exchange ahead of government reports that indicated cattle supplies 
were larger and porkbelly supplies smaller than the markets had 
expected 
the agriculture departments quarterly cattleonfeed report 
showed 10 percent more cattle on feedlots as of oct 1 in the 13 
largest cattleproducing states than at the same time a year 
earlier 
in another report the usda reported there were 48 million 
pounds of frozen pork bellies in the nations commercial freezers 
as of sept 30 compared with 32 million pounds a year earlier 
live cattle futures settled 17 cent to 45 cent lower with

frozen pork bellies were 11 cents to 143 cents lower with 
february at 6575 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the chicago board of 
trade in a day of light trading influenced by harvest pressure 
rumors of soviet grain purchases and volatile outside markets 
dry conditions were expected to continue for most of the week in 
the midwest where the corn and soybean crops are centered 
after the close the usda released a weekly report showing the 
corn harvest 47 percent complete and the soybean harvest 57 percent 
complete as of sunday 
wheat futures settled cent to 1 cent lower with december at 
263 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december

nearly half of former east germanys 
workers will have fewer working hours or no job at all by next 
year germanys five leading economic institutes predicted monday 
it was one of the gloomiest employment forecasts ever for east 
germany which united with west germany on oct 3 
economic growth is also slowing in what used to be west germany 
and growth for the whole nation will likely reach only 15 percent 
in 1991 the institutes said 
two top german officials responded to the report by saying its 
unemployment prognosis for eastern germany was too pessimistic new 
investment in the region will quickly create new jobs economics 
minister helmut haussmann and finance minister theo waigel said 
the five institutes said about 11 million people in former east 
germany are either jobless or working shorter weeks the region now 
has 84 million workers 
the regions unemployment problem will peak sometime next year 
with 17 million jobless and 2 million others working fewer hours 
the report forecast the region will average about 14 million 
jobless and 175 million with fewer working hours in 1991 it said 
workers in the region are losing their jobs because many aging 
factories and businesses are unable to compete in the new 
freemarket system the report predicted that production in eastern 
germany will stailize by the middle of 1991 but that the job 
market wont immediately benefit 
the necessary transformation of the east german economy will 
need much time the report said 
the report said the economic transformation of former east 
germany is occurring more slowly than expected because of a slow 
rate of privatization questions of property ownership the 
continued existence of monopolistic operations and difficulties 
in building up a public sector that is capable of achievement 
the institutes also said a slowdown of the world economy and 
shrinking exports will limit germanys overall growth 
in former west germany economic growth in 1991 will slow from 4 
percent predicted for 1990 to 25 percent the institutes forecast 
the report was published by the diw german institute for 
economics in berlin the hwwa institute for economic research in 
hamburg the ifo economic research institute in munich the 
institute for world economics in kiel and the rwi economic research 
institute in essen 
the report assumed that oil prices would gradually declinebut 
remain higher than they were before iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
the researchers said they did not expect higher oil prices to 
dampen the german economy as long as wages dont climb but they 
acknowledged that the gulf crisis presented considerable risks to 
any forecast

a major drexel burnham lambert inc junkbond 
customer with close ties to michael milken has agreed to plead 
guilty to criminal charges related to dealings with the firm a 
federal prosecutor said monday 
the government was expected to use the plea by richard 
grassgreen who resigned last week as chairman of enstar group 
inc to bolster its case at a presentencing hearing on new 
allegations against milken 
the disclosure by assistant us attorney jess fardella came 
during the sixth day of testimony on charges that milken committed 
an array of crimes beyond the six felony counts to which he has 
pleaded guilty 
fardella said grassgreen will plead guilty to two felony counts 
for personally receiving fees on financings paid for by kindercare 
inc enstars predecessor grassgreens lawyer william schwartz 
did not return a call seeking comment 
kindercare a montgomery alabased day care company was 
built largely with money raised by drexel through the sale of 
highyield junk bonds grassgreen and milken had a close 
relationship and milken and his advisers often pointed to 
kindercare as an example of a successful junk bondfinanced 
company 
details of the charges against grassgreen were not disclosed 
but people familiar with his case said they were related to 
misappropriating corporate funds and failing to disclose to his 
board his personal interest in macpherson investment partners a 
fund created by drexel that invested in storer communications inc 
another drexelfinanced takeover deal 
the 1985 storer takeover is one of the main subjects of the 
special presentence hearing on milken underway in federal court 
prosecutors have sought to show milken misappropriated valuable 
storer stock warrants and used them to bribe customers into buying 
risky storer securities 
the accusation is part of the governments attempt to show 
milken was a systematic lawbreaker they want to convince us 
district judge kimba wood he deserves a severe punishment he faces 
28 years imprisonment 
grassgreen was expected to testify as a witness at the milken 
hearing on tuesday about the storer transaction along with former 
drexel chief executive frederick joseph it would be josephs first 
public testimony against milken 
on monday a lawyer who worked for drexel said he questioned 
whether the firm had properly disclosed plans to allocate millions 
of dollars worth of storer equity to important clients and drexel 
employees 
according to the governments charges five drexelaffiliated 
investment partnerships acquired 82 percent of certain storer 
equity warrants without legally disclosing the interests 
a large block of the preferred stock and the warrants were 
repurchased by drexel from a customer atlantic capital shortly 
after the storer deal was completed and in turn sold to macpherson 
one of the drexelformed investment partnerships 
it consisted of several drexel employees and major investors the 
government claims were given a stake by milken as gratuities 
onethird of the partnership was held by a trust for milkens 
children the outside parties included columbia savings amp loan 
chairman thomas spiegel takeover strategist nelson peltz and 
occidental petroleum corp chairman ray arani 
the government has charged that drexel client david solomon was 
sold an interest in macpherson to compensate for trades conducted 
by drexel to help him generate illegal tax losses a transaction 
included in milkens guilty plea 
the drexel lawyer craig cogut testified that the failure to 
disclose the 82 percent stake in the storer raised questions in his 
mind i was concerned as to whether it was appropriate for 
individual representatives of clients to receive these partnership 
interests he said 
cogut also said that a fund manager who was given a stake in 
macpherson in 1987 became concerned whether the investment was 
appropriate 
but he said he did not discuss the disclosure with milken he 
also said milkens brother lowell handled the bulk of drafting 
documents and structuring the storer deal and that he had very 
little contact with michael milken 
the government dropped criminal charges against lowell milken as 
part of michael milkens guilty plea in april

nintendo co which has strictly 
controlled the manufacture of games for its entertainment systems 
has offered us companies that design the games the chance to 
manufacture them a company spokeswoman said monday 
lynne gray a spokeswoman for nintendo in los angeles said the 
company sent a memo to its licensees on oct 3 offering the chance 
for them to manufacture their designs 
no one has signed up yet to do so gray said describing the 
program as experimental 
the japanese company licenses designers to produce games for its 
patented systems and manufactures the game cartridges itself in 
japan nintendos wildly popular computer system revitalized the 
video game industry in this country 
gray said the experimental offer was unrelated to a federal 
trade commission investigation of nintendo for possible 
anticompetitive practices 
nintendo had been studying the possibility of allowing games to 
be manufactured by licensees for some time gray said it waited 
she said until it could be assured that quality control could be 
maintained by outside manufacturers 
nintendo makes many of its own games including its no 1 game 
super mario bros 3 which has sold 8 million copies since its 
introduction earlier this year it licenses 53 other companies to 
design games but maintains exclusive marketing rights 
nintendo whose subsidiary nintendo of america inc is based in 
this seattle suburb estimates total video game market retail sales 
for 1990 at 51 billion of that nintendo estimates it will 
capture 41 billion or 80 percent 
it forecasts it will sell about 9 million of its game systems 
this year the systems range in price from 7995 to 14995 
nintendo spokesman richard lindner said the ftc investigation 
stemmed from allegations made late last year by rep dennis eckart 
dohio that nintendo was stifling competition lindner said the 
ftc has been examining company records and talking with officials 
from nintendo and its licensees competitors and retailers since 
shortly after the first of the year

american express said it earned 3438 million or 74 cents per

quarter of 1989 the drop in pershare earnings reflected an 
increase in the number of american express outstanding shares 
the companys revenue tumbled 68 percent to 606 billion from 
65 billion a year earlier 
the decline was largely attributable to a slump in revenue at 
shearson where sales fell 233 percent to 252 billion from 328 
billion shearson recorded a loss of 54 million compared with 
earnings of 409 million in the same period of 1989

its institutional money management division

house and senate negotiators approved a 
cleanair bill monday that is expected to eventually cost the 
economy 22 billion a year and affect most of american society by 
toughening pollution controls on automobiles factories and power 
plants 
the bargainers worked out the final details before dawn ending 
more than a year of bargaining between the two chambers late 
monday afternoon the conference committee gave the measure formal 
endorsement with only rep william dannemeyer rcalif opposing 
it 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
legislation historic in its significance and said he expected 
both the senate and house to endorse it and president bush to sign 
it into law final approval from both chambers is expected by 
weeks end 
bush meanwhile noted that tougher cleanair legislation has 
been 13 years in coming and said that no american should have 
to wait another day for clean air 
republican members of the cleanair conference including rep 
norman lent of new york and sen john chafee of rhode island 
predicted that bush would sign the bill 
late monday white house officials indicated that the president 
would likely look favorably on the bill including the compromise 
jobassistance program 
while we have to take a look at the final language we are 
encouraged by the agreement reached on the jobs assistance 
amendment said white house spokesman steve hart 
earlier white house press secretary marlin fitzwater had 
indicated that the administration was still not satisfied by worker 
assistance program although he too said the administration has 
not signaled a veto 
under the legislation there would be drastic reductions in 
emissions of acid rain pollutants and toxic industrial chemicals 
in addition more than 100 cities would be given five to 15 years 
to bring their air quality up to federal standards mainly by 
controlling pollutants that cause smog 
the new requirements would be expensive although cost estimates 
vary widely 
the white house estimates the legislation would cost the economy 
11 billion a year by 1995 and 22 billion to 25 billion annually 
by 2005 when the bills provisions would take full effect 
industry estimates have put the cost in the 30 billion to 50 
billion range toward the end of the decade 
while conceding that the controls would cost in the tens of 
billions of dollars environmentalists have argued that much of the 
cost can be expected to be made up from savings in health costs 
the american lung association estimates that perhaps 50 billion a 
year could be saved in reduced health expenses from cleaner air 
to improve air quality the nearly 700page bill would 
tighten controls on tailpipe emissions cutting smogcausing 
pollutants from motor vehicles by 30 percent to 60 percent 
businesses such as dry cleaners would also have to cut 
smogproducing emissions 
require the sale of cleaner gasoline blends in cities with the 
worst smog problems and a phasein of alternativefuel vehicles in 
taxi and other fleets a pilot program using private 
alternativefuel cars would also be started in california 
for the first time control industrial releases of 189 toxic 
chemicals including many carcinogens through the installation of 
pollutioncontrol equipment toxic air emissions which total more 
than 24 billion pounds a year would be cut by 90 percent by the 
end of the decade 
reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions from coalburning power 
plants by 10 million tons cutting nearly in half such acid 
rainproducing emissions midwestern utilities reliant on 
highsulfur coal would be hit the hardest 
many of the plants will have to install expensive scrubbers 
or switch to lowsulfur coal those prospects have led many 
lawmakers to call for a financial aid program for miners who lose 
their jobs because of the tougher pollution controls 
as they finished work on the bill the negotiators agreed to a 
250 million fiveyear program to help workers who lose their 
jobs but only if tied to a retraining program with strict 
qualification standards 
congress worked more than a year to craft the legislation as 
lawmakers struggled to find compromises that would overcome strong 
regional interests amid intense lobbying from the myriad of 
affected industries 
the house and the senate approved separate versions of cleanair 
legislation earlier this year but the task of reconciling 
differences proved slow and difficult 
indeed while representatives of the two chambers began their 
work in midjuly there was no significant progress until earlier 
this month when agreement was reached on automobile pollution 
house and senate negotiators followed with agreements to reduce 
toxic industrial chemicals and on sunday reached an accord on 
acid rain
