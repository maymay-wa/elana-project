the soviet parliament on wednesday put off voting 
on a progressive tax on people who work for private cooperatives a 
key element of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
such a move by the supreme soviet which normally approves laws 
that have been put forward by the ruling communist party is very 
unusual it may reflect concern about the contents of the law as 
well as a greater willingness to speak out under gorbachevs policy 
of greater openness 
the two chambers of the supreme soviet the nominal parliament 
met in separate sessions wednesday to debate the law scheduled to 
go into effect on july 1 
the law also guarantees that cooperatives property will not be 
seized by the government 
officials have said the aim of the progressive tax system on 
income earned by individuals who work in cooperatives is to get the 
cooperatives to invest in expanding their businesses rather than 
paying high salaries to workers 
gorbachev has pushed cooperatives as a method of augmenting the 
staterun economy which cannot provide enough consumer goods and 
services 
soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov said in a speech to the opening 
session of the supreme soviet on tuesday that the law was of 
immense social and political significance 
he said the cooperative system in a short time can solve the 
most severe problems of perestroika restructuring the demand of 
the population for goods and services 
the cooperative law was to have been brought before a joint 
meeting of the supreme soviet on wednesday but officials at the 
meeting said 22 parliamentarians spoke about the law in meetings of 
the separate chambers wednesday morning and that it was delayed 
while a commission looked at a series of proposed amendments 
officials at the supreme soviet meeting gave no details of the 
issues under debate but the tass news agency said in a report that 
judging by the deputies remarks the new edition of the law has 
caused no objections of principle while the amendments suggested 
are dictated by the desire to protect cooperatives from unfounded 
interference by local authorities 
groundless limitations are introduced in many places often 
under the pretext of attempts to keep workers from leaving state 
enterprises tass said another reason behind the limitations 
is the bigoted idea that a cooperative is something to be looked 
down at 
it said other problems facing cooperatives are the difficulty of 
obtaining supplies and the system of taxation 
ryzhkov said tuesday that 6000 cooperatives had been formed in 
the previous three months while the new law was being debated 
while a total of 14000 had been formed in 18 months 
restaurants are one of the most popular forms of cooperatives 
that have opened and others have formed to make clothing pump 
gas do apartment repairs and provide other services

democratic lt gov leo mccarthy is 
trailing in the polls and in fund raising but he has one thing in 
his favor as he seeks to unseat republican sen pete wilson this 
year the jinx 
for more than 30 years no one has been reelected to the senate 
seat wilson holds incumbents have died stepped down or been 
defeated and descended into political oblivion by contrast 
democrat alan cranston is flourishing in his fourth term holding 
down the states other seat 
everybody talks about the jinx said craig schmidt a 
wilson aide but this is the year the jinx will be broken 
wilson not surprisingly agrees i think its nonsense a myth 
were going to prove its not true 
the question of whether unlucky tradition will prevail may be 
the most exciting thing about the race which is generally viewed 
as a showdown between two competent conventional and largely 
colorless politicians 
both men are youthfullooking cleancut candidates with 
reputations for personal honesty and are perceived as moderates in 
their respective parties 
mccarthy 57 a former san francisco county supervisor who spent 
14 years in the legislature including six years as assembly 
speaker is expected to have no trouble defeating two littleknown 
challengers in the june 7 democratic primary robert j banuelos a 
communications consultant from orange and charles greene of los 
angeles 
wilson 54yearold former mayor of san diego is unopposed for 
the gop nomination 
since january 1987 wilson has raised 47 million and spent 
about 4 million while mccarthy has raised 24 million and spent 
17 million both candidates say about 80 percent of their funds 
will be used to buy television advertising a critical resource in 
this vast state which comprises 10 percent of the nations 
population 
weve spent the recesses and the weekends campaigning 
wilson said in an interview earlier this month perched on the rear 
seat of a minivan zipping along interstate 5 weve been out 
virtually every weekend but its literally impossible for me to 
meet everybody in one recent campaign swing wilson hit 13 
cities in three days targeting growers and business groups while 
mccarthy has been on the road with a nofrills whistlestopstyle 
campaign from a motorhome 
mccarthy said he has used the lieutenant governors position to 
push legislation for health care for the elderly nursing home 
improvements and child care programs i think the elderly see me 
as their no 1 champion this is a very significant area of 
strength for me this is something everyone concedes 
but i dont exaggerate the power inherent in the lieutenant 
governors office mccarthy added i received far more media 
attention when i was assembly speaker 
the most recent statewide survey of california voters a may 11 
poll by the gallup organization showed wilson with a 21point lead 
over mccarthy 51 percent to 30 percent with 19 percent undecided 
mccarthy however dismisses the polls contending they largely 
reflect wilsons television advertising campaign 
since those polls mccarthy received more bad news when a 
phalanx of hollywood film moguls eight powerful studio chiefs 
endorsed wilson the studio bosses included several prominent 
democrats 
mccarthy belittled the significance of the may 2 endorsements 
saying that such stars morgan fairchild jack lemmon bruce willis 
and warren beatty remained loyal to him 
at issue is a us senate seat that has traded hands 
continuously since the 1950s 
moderate democrat clair engle who won the seat in 1958 died in 
office and john f kennedys former press secretary pierre 
salinger was appointed to complete his term 
salinger lost his 1964 election bid to hollywood songanddance 
man george murphy a conservative republican who in turn was 
defeated in 1970 by john tunney a democrat and the son of boxer 
gene tunney 
in 1976 tunney was defeated by former san francisco state 
university president si hayakawa an acidtongued articulate 
semanticist known for his hardline approach to student protesters 
in 1982 faced with week standings in the polls hayakawa 
retired and was succeeded by wilson

an ancient road traveled by the likes 
of genghis khan marco polo and babur has become an active artery 
of commerce today between china and pakistan 
more than 2000 years ago silk and spices made their way out of 
china on the route while gold silver and wool made their way in 
the commerce today is considerably more diverse if not as 
exotic 
as many as 80 pakistani merchants travel the road into china 
each day in battered buses to buy silk porcelain and pearls and 
chinese businessmen head in the opposite direction toward the 
khunjerab pass on the border as part of a barter arrangement 
between the two countries 
the barter enables the chinese to trade hydroelectric equipment 
farm tools textiles quilts and porcelain for pakistani 
cigarettes medical herbs dried fruits shoes and razor blades 
the volume of official barter has increased to the equivalent of 
3 million in the past year compared to 300000 in 1986 
according to sadeq malek sales officer of pakistans northern 
areas traders cooperatives 
the road also is being traveled more and more by tourists 
from pakistans border post of sost the road follows the hunza 
river then runs along the icy khunjerab river into china crossing 
numerous glaciers as it climbs to the khunjerab pass it goes 
through a series of narrow chasms and steep declines 
at tashkargan the first chinese town across the border workmen 
are building hotels and inns to accommodate the growing number of 
travelers passing through 
kamel tahsin manager of the governmentrun pamir hotel in 
tashkargan said the new hotels will be more modern and better 
equipped 
business is getting better he said so we have to add a 
couple of wings to our hotel 
tahsin is one of about 12000 people in tashkargan who are 
shiite moslem tajiks the tribe dominant in the area they are 
distinguishable by their sharp features and their women by their 
colorful costume 
across the border in sost pakistanis also are building to meet 
the growing flow of tourists 
assif khan a pakistani government tourist official said big 
tour groups now travel to china four times a month compared to 
twice a month a year ago 
but its a tough road to travel says amanollah mogul the bus 
driver who makes the journey about once a day back and forth to 
china 
the khunjerab pass he said makes him dizzy

horticulturists from china garden club members 
from biggleswade and windowbox farmers from the inner city 
clutched their coveted tickets tuesday for the chelsea flower show 
which has sprouted along the river thames this week like a promise 
of summer 
on the sundappled lawns beside the redbrick royal hospital are 
displayed the very best roses dahlias pansies and delphiniums 
that this nation of gardeners can produce 
so great are the crowds at britains most prestigious annual 
garden extravaganza that the royal horticultural society limited 
ticket sales for the fourday trade show to 45000 per day at 26 
each and may have to move to a larger site next year 
last year 243000 people crowded onto the 19acre site most of 
them milling under the 3acre marquee that covers the choicest 
displays 
members of the 84yearold society which has sponsored the 
chelsea show since 1913 have their own viewing days as does queen 
elizabeth ii 
membership in the society is 110000 and growing said assistant 
secretary stephen bennett most are britons but there are many 
american members and a japanese branch has just begun 
more leisure time and income have boosted the growth of 
gardening bennett said 
but the most important thing is there are no social 
barriers he said at the show youll see dowagers and dustmen 
garbage collectors talking about the same thing 
gardening in britain is the closest thing to a universal 
interest not counting curiosity about the royal family 
five weekly tv and radio programs are devoted to gardening and 
the british broadcasting corps 13part series the victorian 
kitchen garden was such a hit last year that its already being 
repeated 
it is difficult to imagine another country where a half hour of 
prime time television would be devoted to the growing of tomatoes 
or methods of repelling slugs where a person alarmed by clematis 
wilt can telephone an expert on tv and get immediate help or where 
three wry horticulturists could become national celebrities through 
their radio questionandanswer show 
some citydwellers nurturing pots of herbs on the windowsill or 
geraniums on the roof terrace dream of the gardening opportunities 
in the countryside but even in london most people have access to 
a bit of grass and soil and just about all of them plant something 
in it 
because most of central londons dwellings are rowhouses there 
are thousands of narrow back gardens neatly fenced and stretching 
to meet an identical row of gardens from the houses on the next 
street 
the english rose honeysuckle ivy jasmine and purple wisteria 
climb the fences and camouflage the garden sheds lilacs plum 
trees lavender and foxgloves fill the borders often leaving just 
enough grass to warrant a push mower 
even in the teeming center of the city there often is a garden 
in the back and a cat lying in the sun no upstanding neighborhood 
pub is without its windowbox of ivy and geraniums 
the 18 garden club members on a chevron north sea oil platform 
never have to worry about slugs and aphids although space is 
limited in their 10 foot by 8 foot greenhouse bolted to the deck 
100 miles off the shetland islands northeast of scotland 
you get a great feeling of satisfaction when you sit down to a 
fresh tomato sprinkled with chopped basil knowing youve grown 
them both rig electrician malcolm dobinson told the daily mail 
thousands of londoners work allotments patches of public land 
rented for a few pounds a year to families who want to grow their 
own food 
we got 60 pounds of strawberries off the allotment last 
year said ena mundy whos been attending the chelsea show for 
30 years 
she and her husband travel 18 miles twice a week to their 
allotment because the soil is lovely rich and loamy now were 
retired its our main interest she said 
outer londons barnet borough has 250 acres in allotments each 
10 yards by 30 yards 
most of these amateur gardeners would probably agree with writer 
alan titchmarsh who told an interviewer theres really nowhere 
else in the world id rather be than in my garden when my time 
comes id be happy to peg out there an epitaph gone to make 
manure

more than 17 years after wilda richardson 
mailed a christmas card to an acquaintance the post office 
returned it unopened 
but mrs richardson wasnt upset 
im sure that whatever happened was an accident she said 
im sure the post office tries their best not to let this kind of 
thing happen 
the card mailed dec 22 1970 showed up mysteriously last week 
marked return to sender it was intended for mildred mealor a 
fellow member of the pilot club international who has since died 
in 1970 mrs richardson was executive director of the service 
club for business and professional women each year she mailed 
hundreds of homemade christmas cards to friends and club chapters 
across the country 
the card came back with a may 18 postmark from gainesville and a 
may 19 postmark from macon it was not delivered postage due even 
though it bore a 6cent stamp 
mrs richardson 84 said she has mailed so many christmas cards 
that she had no idea this one never reached its destination 
no one knows where the card spent the last 17 years 
gainesville postmaster larry latimer was baffled 
if it was found in my post office im sure i would have heard 
about it given the size of our office its hard to imagine it 
lying around for 18 years latimer said

call him persistent call him tenacious 
or call him what coworkers at a computer company dubbed him after 
a threeyear struggle to rid the plant grounds of geese mr 
goosebuster 
norm heifetz 52 facilities manager of the bytex corp has 
become a minor celebrity employees presented him with a mr 
goosebuster plaque and goosebuster emblems can be spotted 
throughout the company heifetz said heifetz picture even 
appeared on the front page of a local newspaper 
his fame came after he waged war with the pesky geese which 
filled the manmade pond at the plant and even worse strolled 
all over the grounds 
they come and proliferate and have babies and they make a holy 
mess of the property he said they like young fresh grass so 
they go grazing all day long it wouldnt have been so bad if they 
stayed out back but they came strolling on the sidewalk near the 
front entrance 
at first he banged pots and pans to frighten the geese away 
then while researching the problem he learned that geese are 
deathly afraid of swans and bought a bunch of fake ones 
nothing worked 
last year when the geese returned in late spring heifetz began 
a new plan of attack he wired up huge speakers and blared distress 
calls over the pond still the geese remained 
then heifetz tried a small remotecontrolled boat success at 
last 
it made a terrible noise and chased them out he said

the government took pity on primary and middle 
school students who complain of too much homework and testing by 
setting strict limits on both an official report said today 
the englishlanguage china daily said the state education 
commission banned homework for firstgrade pupils and set graduated 
limits for older students 
the limits range from 30 minutes a day for second and 
thirdgrade students to an hour daily for sixthgrade pupils the 
report said it did not say what the average length of assignments 
had been 
the panel also said pupils should not be given the kind of 
homework that requires heavy monotonous routine work such as large

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis said tuesday it was a 
very serious mistake for president reagan to veto trade 
legislation that requires advance notice of plant closing george 
bushs aides sought to reassure house republicans about the vice 
presidents poor standing in recent polls 
we have bad polls rep lynn martin of illinois said after 
attending a closeddoor session with bushs top advisers if this 
were october wed be suicidal but its may 
jesse jackson dukakis sole remaining democratic rival 
campaigned in california in advance of the states june 7 primary 
he said he would seek government assistance for a farm town where a 
dozen children have been diagnosed with cancer in recent years 
massachusetts gov dukakis spent most of the day in boston 
where he issued a statement blasting reagan and bush on the trade 
bill and linking the veto to negotiations with panamas manuel 
noriega who faces indictment on drug charges 
any administration that is willing to give gen noriega 120 
days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the 
american worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the 
street he said in a statement 
bush declared his independence from reagan on the noriega talks 
last week saying he opposed negotiations designed to force the 
panamanian leader to give up his power in exchange for having the 
drug indictments dropped 
the vice president had no official appearances during the day 
although he added idaho to his list of primary state victories 
with a quarter of the precincts reporting bush had 81 percent to 
10 percent for pat robertson who suspended his republican 
candidacy earlier this month 
bush was winning 15 delegates in idaho to two for robertson 
and one uncommitted the vice president wrapped up a majority of 
republican national convention delegates a month ago 
the democratic primary in idaho was a nonbinding preference 
poll and no delegates were at stake dukakis won easily with 77 
percent to jacksons 14 percent with 24 percent of the precincts 
reporting 
the next and last democratic primary elections will be june 
7 with contests in california new jersey new mexico and montana 
although neither bush nor dukakis was out campaigning during the 
day each took steps to rally the troops around their certain 
candidacies 
the vice presidents campaign officials announced that sen 
charles grassley and gov terry branstad would play important roles 
in the fall campaign in iowa grassley was a staunch supporter of 
sen bob dole in the states heated caucus campaign which bush 
lost in a third place finish while branstad was neutral 
on the democratic side dukakis arranged a visit to washington 
on wednesday en route to campaigning in california his aides said 
he would meet with several groups of house members and senators 
and expected to pick up endorsements from roughly a dozen lawmakers 
as he closes in on a nominating majority of democratic national 
convention delegates 
three top bush advisers met with house republicans and one of 
them pollster robert teeter said polls indicate the vice 
president is running behind but the race is in a very artificial 
period he said he told the lawmakers that what you got to do 
is get past this california primary before people begin to focus on 
it the presidential race 
several lawmakers said bushs decision to disagree with reagans 
policy of negotiations with noriega drew praise 
its a very symbolic circumstance where bush has moved from 
being vice president to being his own candidate said rep jim 
leach of iowa 
ms martin added almost to a person they were pleased about 
the separation on noriega 
but she also said there was concern about recent polls 
indicating dukakis leads the vice president there wasnt anybody 
up screaming my god weve got the titanic she said 
dukakis linkage of the trade bill veto with the noriega 
negotiations marked an attempt to hit bush on two issues that 
democratic strategists believe damage the vice president 
to veto this bill because it will give working people and 
their families 60 days notice before theyre laid off seems to me 
to be unconscionable he said 
he said reagan and bush dont understand that for working 
families who struggle to pay the mortgage save for their 
childrens education and care for their elders there is nothing 
more painful than losing a job 
i think the president is making a very serious mistake this 
is a good trade bill its a responsible bill he said

it isnt easy to hold an audiences attention 
with a fulllength ballet which has no plot and few choreographers 
try graeme murphy has tried and succeeded with shining 
the sydney dance company from australia danced the twohour 
shining tuesday night as the opening program of a twoweek 
season at the city center murphy choreographed it in 1986 to mark 
10 years as the companys artistic director 
the first section titled dawn had duets trios quartets 
and groups of 14 while the enormously vital and versatile dancers 
were on stage murphy allowed them no rest they were swinging 
around jumping lifting or being lifted swooping down for floor 
work being dragged or dragging somebody along the floor 
the music by karol szymanowski sounded like dramatic movie 
music with something important about to happen every minute when 
the tempo was especially fast it was usually nina veretennikova 
who danced 
alfred williams had a mesmerizing solo in the first section he 
and andrea toy danced the second section predawn which 
murphy created in 1985 as a duet named shimmering 
the final section night has duets quartets and groups 
again and is almost entirely danced in couples 
shining was never predictable 
the company gave the us premiere of shining may 16 at 
stanford calif after june 8 and 9 performances in san antonio 
texas the company will perform for two months in europe after 
venice which will be danced this season had its american 
premiere when the company was last in new york in 1985

nicaraguas contra rebels will offer to lay 
down their arms on sept 1 as part of a comprehensive peace accord 
to be presented to the nicaraguan government wednesday a 
congressional aide said tuesday 
members of the rebels political directorate in meetings on 
capitol hill and at the state department also said they would not 
be the first to break a twomonth ceasefire after it expires may 
30 even if no new truce agreement is in effect 
and they said they would accept a proposal for delivery of 
humanitarian aid to their forces inside nicaragua by an agency with 
ties to the organization of american states 
but they made it clear that did not mean they were accepting the 
sandinista governments unilateral announcement made a day 
earlier that it simply would extend the current truce for another 
month 
rather the contra proposal will include all the necessary 
things for a permanent end to the war in nicaragua said alfredo 
cesar a member of the directorate and the leader of the 
negotiating delegation 
an aide to house speaker jim wright dtexas who was briefed on 
the contra proposal said wright hoped the move was sincere and 
constructive the aide wilson morris said the setting of a date 
for the rebels to lay down their arms in particular appears to 
be progress 
in an interview tuesday night wright said tomorrow i hope 
and believe that a major effort will be made to open up the peace 
plan and to reach a settlement between the two sides in 
nicaragua 
broad suggestions are going to be made by the resistance 
the contras that they will accept a certain time to lay down their 
arms and reintegrate into the society if the government will make 
certain guarantees of free elections at certain specific dates and 
guarantee of private properties and the restoration of those civil 
liberties wright said on cable news networks larry king 
live program 
cesar said the proposal will go beyond the ceasefire agreement 
reached two months ago in sapoa nicaragua and include a timetable 
for specific political changes called for in last years regional 
peace agreement 
those changes include a free and fair electoral system an 
independent judiciary with the power to guarantee human rights 
removal of the military from sandinista party control and 
guaranteed property rights he said 
cesar also said the rebels were prepared to accept a proposal to 
have 177 million in us humanitarian aid delivered through the 
pan american development foundation which would subcontract with 
commercial carriers to distribute supplies to troops inside 
ceasefire zones in nicaragua 
the foundation is tied to the organization of american states 
whose secretary general joao baena soares is on a commission to 
verify compliance with the ceasefire agreement 
cesar said the sandinistas have failed to comply with 
commitments made in sapoa and that a simple extension of the 
current truce would not address those failures 
an extension of the truce period means an extension for the 
sandinistas to keep violating sapoa to keep imprisoning union 
leaders to keep interfering with freedom of the press said 
adolfo calero another directorate member 
meanwhile american and honduran officials say nicaragua appears 
to be building up stocks of weapons and making other preparations 
for an attack on the contras if the peace talks fail according to 
a published report 
the officials cite aerial reconnaissance photographs and other 
evidence they say suggest a military buildup the new york times 
reported in its wednesday editions 
us officials said the photographs showed that airfields at 
wapsam near the honduran border and at la tranquera in southern 
nicaragua have been upgraded that new military storage depots are 
being built near sebaco about 50 miles north of managua and that 
military supplies are being stockpiled at el tempisque just outside 
managua 
president reagan meanwhile accused the sandinistas of 
footdragging saying the united states was looking for deeds 
not more words 
if the current stalemate in the peace process persists and the 
sandinistas continue their policies of repression then we will 
call upon the congress to reconsider its feb 3 decision to curtail 
assistance to the nicaraguan freedom fighters reagan said in a 
statement issued by the white house 
the president said that despite the 60day truce the 
sandinistas have continued and indeed intensified their repression 
of the nicaragua people 
since the sapoa accord was reached the contra ranks have been 
torn by internal bickering and power struggles cesar acknowledged 
that the rebels now are weaker militarily than they were in march 
but not politically 
he said the rebels primary leverage in the new round of talks 
will be the threat that if the sandinistas appear intransigent 
congress could be moved to grant new military aid to the contras 
and renew the war 
cesar noted that the sandinista attitude softened following a 
may 12 letter from 24 members of congress who warned that military 
aid could be resumed if the leftist government did not facilitate 
delivery of aid to rebel troops inside the country 
all five members of the directorate of the nicaraguan resistance 
cesar calero pedro joaquin chamorro maria azucena ferrey and 
aristides sanchez will go to the talks

gov michael s dukakis has survived a republican 
attempt to scale back his pay to reflect the days he spends in his 
statehouse office and not on the presidential campaign trail 
late tuesday after nearly 10 hours of debate over next years 
state budget republican rep kevin poirier offered an amendment to 
the 1888828 intended to pay the governor and his staff 
under the language offered by poirier dukakis would get paid 
only for days he is in the state 
since the start of this year poirier noted the governor has 
spent 68 days out of state 18 days in state and 51 days in which 
he spent part of the day here and part elsewhere 
so therefore for the 68 days he was out of the state based 
on his salary of 85000 he owes us 15835 the assistant 
minority leader said 
with this amendment what im trying to do is bring some 
fiscal sanity back into the commonwealth we do have a fiscal 
crisis lets try to address it in his office he said 
no democrat rose to defend the governor but the amendment was 
defeated on a voice vote

gov michael s dukakis has asked massachusetts 
lawmakers to approve a crime package designed to tighten state laws 
on child pornography drunken driving and criminal sentencing 
over the past five years we have done a lot to fight crime 
and make our citizens safer here in massachusetts the democratic 
presidential hopeful said tuesday in testimony to the legislatures 
joint criminal justice committee 
thats because weve worked together on a gettough 
nononsense approach to crime thats based on results not 
rhetoric 
but dukakis said recent drugrelated violence in boston was a 
grim reminder of the expanding agenda of crime issues 
when we find loopholes in our laws that allow criminals to 
avoid punishment or when we find programs that could be 
strengthened to protect innocent children then we need to work 
together and take action he said 
he appealed for swift action on 
the latest version of his presumptive sentencing bill 
which dukakis has offered annually in his second and third terms 
the legislation would establish sentencing guidelines for crimes 
and allow prosecutors to appeal sentences they consider too low 
a bill to restore the state law against child pornography 
which was struck down earlier this year by the state supreme court 
on the grounds that it was unconstitutionally broad 
on monday the us supreme court agreed to review the state 
courts action but dukakis argued that the state needs a law on 
the books immediately in order to prevent the devastating and 
lifelong psychological and physical damage caused by sexual 
exploitation 
legislation to increase penalties against drivers who leave the 
scene of an accident the governors brother was killed by a 
hitandrun driver 
dukakis legislative package also would allow massachusetts 
police to cross state lines in hot pursuit of drunken drivers 
and increase the penalties for refusing to submit to a breath test 
for the first time dukakis also supported a measure allowing 
judges to revoke the driving license of anyone convicted of a drug 
offense 
in his testimony dukakis credited the legislature and his own 
administration for making massachusetts safer he said overall 
crime is down more than 13 percent in the last four years the 
secondlargest such decline of any state

senate backers of a major trade bill are 
expecting an uphill battle to find enough votes to override 
president reagans veto in striking contrast to the quick and 
overwhelming house vote to reverse the presidents action 
we have to have another three votes at this point and i dont 
know where they are going to come from said senate finance 
committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas a chief sponsor of the 
1000page trade measure 
the senate is expected to take up the legislation after it 
returns from the memorial day recess 
reagans veto of the legislation on tuesday came as no surprise 
he has been critical in numerous speeches of a provision that would 
require companies to give employees 60 days notice of plant 
closings and largescale layoffs he has said that businesses need 
flexibility to survive hard times 
in his veto message to congress reagan repeated that argument 
i support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much 
advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes 
necessary it is the humane thing to do 
but i object to the idea that the federal government would 
arbitrarily mandate for all conditions and under all 
circumstances exactly when and in what form that notification 
should take place 
the president urged lawmakers to submit a revised version trade 
bill that he could sign in good conscience 
within hours of reagans veto the house voted 308113 to 
override it that was far more than needed to be successful 
sixty republicans broke with reagan to vote for the override 
while only one democrat robert j mrazek of new york supported 
the president 
the plantclosings measure is among scores of provisions 
contained in the bill the main ones would overhaul the us system 
of import restrictions others range from repealing the windfall 
profits tax to adding billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies 
democratic leaders have argued that patching together a stripped 
down trade bill might be tough before congress leaves town for the 
campaign trail 
uncertain of override prospects in the senate many democrats 
focused on making the debate a campaign issue 
i happen to think its a better issue for democrats than for 
republicans house speaker jim wright dtexas said 
michael dukakis the frontrunner in the battle for the 
democratic presidential nomination called the presidents action 
unconscionable 
he said that reagan and vice president george bush dont 
understand that for working families who struggle to pay the 
mortgage save for their childrens education and care for their 
elders there is nothing more painful than losing a job 
he contrasted the veto to a tentative deal under which drug 
charges against antonio manuel noriega the panamanian leader 
would be dropped if he agreed to relinquish power and leave panama 
by august 
any administration that is willing to give general noriega 120 
days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the 
american worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the 
street dukakis said 
reagan said that he vetoed the measure with sincere regret 
but said in his message that returning the measure to congress was 
necessary 
i am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our 
economic growth the president said 
he said that the american economy has created 16 million jobs 
during his administration and that the unemployment rate is at its 
lowest point in 14 years 
he also said that the measure would push us in the direction 
of protectionism closing our borders is not the solution to 
opening foreign markets reagan said 
administration supporters rallied to reagans support following 
the veto 
rep william frenzel rminn scoffed at the image of 
unfeeling and meanspirited owners of large and small american 
businesses putting upon weak and defenseless workers who are about 
to be thrown out on the street unless big government puts its 
firm and fatherly hand on the situation 
as usual this house believes that big government knows more 
than we in private life frenzel said this debate paints a 
depressing view of america and it is inaccurate 
but the veto also unleashed a torrent of criticism on the house 
floor 
the japanese are laughing now that you have vetoed this trade 
bill said rep charles schumer dny 
for seven years the reagan administration has just said no to 
american workers rep edward markey dmass said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass issued a statement saying that 
the country understands the importance of notice about plant 
closings and layoffs even if the white house does not 
voluntary notice is a fig leaf over the problem kennedy 
said 
sen frank murkowski ralaska however recalled in a statement 
that restrictions on exports of oil from his state remain in the 
legislation 
i voted against the trade bill when it passed the senate and 
intend to vote to sustain the presidents veto murkowski said

defense lawyers are accusing independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh of trying to punish former white house 
aide oliver l north and two codefendants for trying to tell 
congress the whole truth about the irancontra affair 
the defense contends that walsh was completely wrong on the 
law by claiming that hundreds of statements that north former 
national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer albert 
hakim made to congress could be used against them as evidence of 
criminal wrongdoing 
by claiming the defendants waived their limited immunity grants 
from congress walsh seeks to punish defendants for responding 
fully and in good faith to congressional inquiries when compelled 
to do so over vehement objection and for relaying to congress and 
the nation what occurred and why the defense said in a brief 
filed tuesday 
although north poindexter and hakim testified under immunity 
grants that prohibit use of their statements as evidence against 
them walsh contends that the defendants waived the privilege 
against selfincrimination by volunteering answers that were not 
responsive to questions posed by the irancontra committees 
walsh has said that he would not use any of this congressional 
testimony during the trial if the court denies a defense request to 
conduct an extensive hearing to determine if his investigation was 
tainted by impermissible use of the defendants immunized 
statements 
the defense called walshs offer an attempt to threaten the 
court with a lengthy inquiry into immunized testimony and then to 
use that threat as leverage to strike a favorable bargain with the 
court 
this tactic is unseemly the defense lawyers said in a joint 
pleading 
north the fired national security council aide poindexter and 
hakim are accused of conspiring with retired air force maj gen 
richard v secord to defraud the government by diverting iran 
armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels secord also an arms 
dealer testified without an immunity grant from congress 
north poindexter and hakim contend that their fifth amendment 
right against selfincrimination would be violated if they were 
forced to stand trial on criminal charges following their compelled 
congressional testimony they claim that walshs prosecution was 
tainted by illegal use of their sworn statements to congress 
us district judge gerhard a gesell is scheduled to hear 
arguments on the issue on thursday 
in its latest filing the defense said there is no claim that 
defendants uttered a single word during the course of their 
congressional testimony that was outside the subject matter of the 
congressional inquiry 
north poindexter and hakim were not waiving any rights when 
they explained their answers or sought to provide useful 
related information to be sure their answers were complete and 
accurate in short the whole truth they had sworn to provide 
the defense said walshs position would force gesell to examine 
each and every one of the hundreds of statements to verify walshs 
claim they were exempt from immunity 
walsh contended that the unprotected statements include 
poindexters admission that he approved the diversion of armssale 
profits to the contras but did not tell president reagan to ensure 
that the president could deny involvement if the operation were 
exposed 
the unprotected statements also include poindexters remarks 
that during attorney general edwin meese iiis november 1986 
investigation poindexter destroyed a presidential intelligence 
finding authorizing cia involvement in one 1985 arms shipment 
walsh contended 
walsh also claimed that norths statements that he destroyed 
documents in october and november 1986 could be used as evidence to 
prove charges that the fired national security council aide 
obstructed meeses inquiry 
in a separate filing on tuesday walshs office said that it 
is clear beyond doubt that north poindexter and hakim waged a 
public relations battle during their congressional testimony 
in utter defiance of the questions put to them they sought to 
win with speeches and arguments the prosecution brief said

hours after george bush campaign aides tried 
to explain to house republicans when things would start going right 
for the vice president president reagan vetoed a trade bill the 
democrats were itching to make an issue in the fall presidential 
campaign 
michael dukakis the democratic presidential nomineetobe 
fired off this response tuesday when the presidents veto message 
reached congress 
any administration that is willing to give general manuel 
noriega 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to 
give the american worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out 
on the street 
the massachusetts governor was referring to the provision that 
would require companies to give workers and communities notice 
before closing plants 
reagan said he thought giving such notice was the humane thing 
to do but he objected to making it mandatory 
i dont really see it as a campaign issue said rep guy 
molinari i could be wrong 
the chairman of the bush campaign in new york molinari was one 
of 60 republicans who deserted the president and voted to override 
the veto 
the house voted 308113 to override the veto but senate 
democratic leaders have predicted the president will prevail in 
that chamber 
the democrats certainly are betting it will be an issue in the 
fall campaign 
i happen to think its a better issue for the democrats than 
for the republicans said house speaker jim wright dtexas 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski 
dill asked why hand it to us on a silver platter 
like the president bush appeared to be walking a narrow line on 
the trade bill 
during a recent campaign appearance he even had kind words for 
the massachusetts plant closing law that dukakis often cites 
in massachusetts they have a plant closing law its 
voluntary its not like the federal government imposing it said 
the vice president 
massachusetts law offers financial and management assistance to 
companies and those that accept are then required to give 90 days 
notice of plant closings 
the trade bill veto came on the same day that bush campaign 
aides were getting encouragement from house republicans for his 
recent moves away from reagan specifically on the noriega 
negotiations 
disagreeing with the idea of dropping drug charges against the 
military leader and de facto ruler of panama is not a politically 
highrisk move 
likewise one must expect that if attorney general edwin meese 
iii continues to cling to his job bush will begin to hint that he 
thinks its time for meese to step aside 
bush doesnt need highpriced pollsters to tell him noriega and 
meese arent bringing him a lot of votes 
but a far more critical question is how many general election 
votes ronald reagan brings his vice president 
bush supporters in the house were sympathetic about the vice 
presidents plight 
i think bush has to say as he has for seven years as long as 
were asking what he would do as vice president he will support 
the president of the united states said rep newt gingrich of 
georgia he can talk about how he would take the offensive in 89 
in other ways but i think it would be very very foolish to allow 
himself to be drawn into day by day picky fights 
but others werent so concerned about picky fights 
what id like to see would be bush coming out on more of the 
issues and articulating the positions that he has said molinari 
i think hes beginning to do that now

the 20th anniversary production of 
hair the rock musical that shocked the world with frontal 
nudity will be shown in a demure version at a united nations 
benefit for children suffering from aids 
some say a show that celebrates carefree love and drug use is 
not the best choice to raise money to fight aids a fatal disease 
transmitted by sexual contact and sharing of intravenous needles 
the onenight presentation thursday at the general assembly hall 
has been watered down to avoid eliciting blushes from diplomats 
fourletter words are edited out free spirits will have to cover 
themselves with fig leaves and there will be no burning of us 
draft cards 
this is a modified version for the united nations one of 
the creators james rado said the street language had to go in 
a united nations format i guess they couldnt take the fourletter 
words there arent that many of them 
but the un just said no added coauthor gerome ragni 
at the end of the first act the cast will not stand singing in 
the nude before the audience that was in 1968 this is a swishy 
blacktie affair for the establishment where the best seats cost 
5000 
the first lady would say no to drug songs production 
manager david bosboom said in an interview referring to nancy 
reagans antidrug campaign whose slogan is just say no to 
drugs 
mrs reagan an honorary chairman of the benefit will not be 
present to hear the 1988 rendition of the songs starshine and 
the age of aquarius although she consults astrologers 
president reagan and his wife leave for the moscow summit this 
morning 
publicist rebecca robbins said that when hair opened 20 
years ago at new yorks public theater the stars were in almost the 
same positions as they will be thursday 
wanda moore the original hair astrologer who now calls 
herself vanessa talmalord has worked out the astrological chart 
for the show 
the moon again is in the seventh house and jupiter is aligned 
with mars said the astrologer 
bosboom quipped that there will be no naked truths here at the 
un but that the soul of the show has remained intact 
yes we had to change the content to suit the united 
nations he said the themes are there but some lyrics have 
changed 
he said the numerous changes were made both out of 
selfcensorship by the creators and at the request of nervous un 
bureaucrats 
one un official muttered privately that the show was 
illconsidered inappropriate and an embarrassment 
how do you have a show celebrating free love and sex at the 
united nations of all places when you are trying to warn against 
aids said the official who demanded anonymity 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome also is 
transmitted through contaminated blood or blood products and from 
infected mothers to their unborn babies the aids virus attacks the 
bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to infections and 
cancers 
ragni and rado have written 14 new songs and the first half of 
the new prodution is an update for the next generation the 
second half is a nostalgic selection of oldies 
sodomy a song from the original wont be sung at 
thursdays production it is now an instrumental by chuck mangione 
some of the songs we had to delete because out of context 
from the original show they dont work ragni said in a recent 
interview 
of sodomy he said its quite beautiful and effective and 
i never had heard it as an instrumental 
the changes have been made to address current issues such as 
the depletion of the ozone layer and banning nuclear bombs 
deletions do away with the vietnam war hippie protest song about 
lbj taking the irt to find people on lsd 
but there still is crooning over donna and the search for 
the 16yearold virgin 
im surprised they left that one in said bosboom 
the production involves more than 100 people and includes some 
members of the original cast a few of the original players decided 
not to take part when they learned that conservative william f 
buckley was a member of the sponsoring creo society it is a 
nonprofit organization working with the united nations childrens 
fund to help young aids victims 
the creo society fund for children with aids is trying to raise 
more than 2 million from the benefit

of all european capitals helsinki is 
probably the most fitting way station for president reagan before 
his moscow summit next week 
geographically and historically neutral finland sees itself as 
the nomans land between east and west 
it also has great saunas as the president may have heard from 
george shultz the secretary of state has made four rest stops in 
helsinki in less than three years on his way to moscow and 
reportedly has become an enthusiast of the traditional finnish 
sweat bath 
reagan is scheduled to arrive in helsinki early thursday 
morning and will spend three nights there recovering from jet lag 
and preparing for his may 29june 2 summit with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
in his only scheduled activities outside his regular saturday 
radio address reagan will meet friday with president mauno 
koivisto and then address finnish leaders on human rights 
he will speak in finlandia hall where 35 heads of state signed 
the 1975 helsinki accords on military security economic 
cooperation and humanitarian issues 
american jewish leaders have announced they will hold a vigil in 
helsinki during reagans stay to draw attention to the demands by 
soviet jews for freedom to emigrate 
though reagan probably wont see much of the city helsinkis 
russian flavor offers him a taste of things to come with its 
trolley cars broad avenues and 19th century buildings the city 
has been used as a set for gorky park and other movies about 
russia 
most of helsinki was devastated by fire in 1808 the same year 
sweden ended its 600year rule of finland and ceded the territory 
to russia it was a russian duchy until 1917 
finlands life in russias shadow has been the theme of its 
politics for centuries it shares a 793mile border with the soviet 
union the longest of any noncommunist state 
the finns like to say they were defeated but not conquered 
by the soviets in world war ii since they retained an independent 
government and parliament but they were forced to cede territory 
pay reparations and sign a treaty of cooperation and friendship 
their postwar caution toward the soviets gave rise to the term 
finlandization as a synonym for obsequiousness in a countrys 
foreign policy 
with all my heart i would like that word to be abolished 
prime minister harri holkeri said with uncharacteristic anger 
during a washington news conference last month 
holkeri who took office in april 1987 is the first prime 
minister from the conservative party since the war before last 
year the party was frozen out of government in deference to moscow 
because of its staunchly antisoviet image 
finns defend their policy by saying they are nobodys lackey 
having for long felt themselves to be menaced by the east and 
let down by the west the finnish people today feel they are 
getting the best of both worlds writes max jakobson a former 
finnish ambassador to the united nations 
the supreme test for finland has been to find a way to live in 
peace with her powerful neighbor without giving up her own system 
of government and her ties with the western world jakobson wrote 
in finland myth and reality published last year 
during the last year finland has increasingly turned away from 
the soviets and more toward western europe 
in april it decided to join the council of europe which it 
once saw as an instrument of the cold war finland had been the 
only major noncommunist european country to stay outside the 
council which monitors human rights in europe 
trade with the soviets dropped from 25 percent of finlands 
total two years ago to 15 percent last year more than 60 percent 
of finlands trade is with western europe and about five percent 
is with the united states

general motors corp says it has found no 
mechanical cause of sudden acceleration in its cbody and hbody 
cars and says the federal investigations of complaints dont mean a 
defect exists 
the automaker made the statement after the national highway 
traffic safety administration said tuesday it had opened an 
engineering evaluation of 14 million 198588 cbody cars 
including the oldsmobile 98 buick electra and cadillac deville and 
fleetwood 
the agency last year began an investigation of 703000 gm hbody 
cars including the 198687 oldsmobile delta 88 and buick lesabre 
and the 1987 pontiac bonneville 
in another matter general motors has dropped a challenge to an 
order from the environmental protection agency and will recall 
82600 pontiacs and buicks from the 1981 model year to fix 
pollution control systems epa said tuesday 
also a federal appeals court tuesday upheld nhtsas refusal to 
reopen an investigation of alleged safety defects in 19661979 ford 
cars 
nhtsa said it had received 110 complaints involving gms cbody 
cars including reports of 67 accidents resulting in 43 injuries 
the agency has received more than 500 complaints about sudden 
acceleration in the hbody cars including reports of more than 300 
accidents 
the hcar and ccar investigations are separate cases on the 
nhtsa docket 
we have never been able to find a common design flaw or 
manufacturing defect said gm spokesman david hudgens weve 
never been able to determine a cause for these incidents 
there is nobody that denies there are incidents of socalled 
sudden acceleration in ours and other cars but weve never been 
able to pin down an engineering or manfacturing root cause for 
them he said 
the cbody and hbody cars use the same v6 engine but nobody 
has indicted the engine hudgens said 
the ccar investigation was started at the request of the center 
for auto safety a washingtonbased consumer group often critical 
of the auto industry and its regulators sam cole of the center 
said design similarities suggested a connection between sudden 
acceleration reports in the cbody and hbody cars 
sudden acceleration allegations in recent years have involved 
nearly every auto manufacturer nhtsa said 
the agency has conducted about 50 investigations into sudden 
acceleration involving vehicles made by 20 manufacturers 
nhtsas latest defect investigation report covering april 
showed four other ongoing engineering analyses and cases involving 
alleged sudden acceleration or throttle control problems 
they involved the 198688 honda acura and sterling and the 
198687 mercedes 300e as well as two that have resulted in 
recalls the 197987 nissan 280z and 300z and the 197886 audi 5000 
in the epa case the cars in question are equipped with a 
43liter sixcylinder engine and were sold as the pontiac lemans 
lemans wagon grand prix catalina bonneville and firebird and as 
the buick regal century and century wagon 
gm said it believes the cars comply but it is dropping the 
challenge to prevent unnecessary litigation 
the ford decision reversed an earlier ruling by the same court 
that the center for auto safety could seek judicial review of the 
agencys refusal to reopen a case involving ford transmissions that 
have a tendency to slip into reverse gear 
clarence ditlow iii executive director of the center said 
there still were 8 million cars with the allegedly defective 
transmissions on the road

five relatives including a man once 
accused of helping convicted spy christopher boyce rob banks were 
arrested for trying to smuggle 45 tons of marijuana and hashish 
into the country authorities said 
the war on drugs is being fought on many fronts this is one 
of the skirmishes this is a battle we happen to have won said 
agent tom sheehan of the drug enforcement administration 
at least 30 tons of hashish and 15 tons of marijuana were seized 
from welded compartments of a barge after it was boarded monday 
night as it entered san francisco bay the tug intrepid venture 
which had the barge in tow also was seized 
authorities believe the asiangrown drugs with a wholesale 
value of 162 million had been loaded off a mother ship 1000 
miles offshore it took eight hours for agents to cut metal covers 
off the compartments to remove the contraband 
this was a very sophisticated operation said rollin b 
klink agent in charge for the customs service in san francisco 
who characterized the organization behind the operation as huge 
he said a piece of minor information led to the bust but 
would not elaborate 
we knew about this boat before it was ever loaded added 
steve giorgi head of the internal revenue service 
the tugs skipper calvin robinson 47 of napa and four 
relatives were charged tuesday in federal court with largescale 
drug smuggling and conspiracy punishable by at least 10 years in 
prison without the possibility of parole and fines of up to 4 
million 
according to court documents robinson was a prison compatriot 
of boyce who was convicted in 1977 of espionage for the soviet 
union robinson reportedly went on the lam with boyce after his 
sensational jan 19 1980 escape from the federal prison at 
lompoc boyce whose exploits were portrayed in the book and movie 
the falcon and the snowman was serving a 40year sentence 
robinson was charged with harboring a fugitive and in connection 
with 13 pacific northwest bank robberies that occurred after 
boyces capture in late 1981 but the charges against robinson were 
dismissed by us district judge harold ryan in idaho for lack of 
evidence boyce pleaded guilty to the robberies and received 25 
additional years in prison 
also arrested in the drug bust were robinsons 25yearold son 
william of vacaville the skippers nephews frank robinson 25 of 
corning and john robinson 23 of santa rosa and stepson wesley 
bastin 25 of corning said assistant us attorney eric swenson 
about 1400 plasticwrapped cardboard boxes filled with 
southeast asian marijuana and 1200 burlap bags of pressed hashish 
were found in the tug 
the 70foot tug left san francisco bay with the barge in tow in 
early may said assistant us attorney steve graham head of the 
organized crime drug enforcement task force 
drug agents tracked the vessels part of the way to the mother 
ship and back the whereabouts of that ship remain unknown 
boyce was convicted in 1977 of selling us satellite 
surveillance secrets to the soviet union from the trw company in 
redondo beach where he had worked from mid1974 to 1976 as a 
security clerk boyce is now serving time at the us penitentiary

us defense secretary frank carlucci 
and his european colleagues in nato will discuss financial 
contributions to the military alliance at a twoday meeting 
scheduled to begin thursday 
the alliances european defense ministers will gather today for 
a routine meeting at nato headquarters in brussels 
us congressional critics of nato claim the european nato 
nations dont pay enough for the common western defense and have 
threatened to withdraw some of the 320000 american troops in 
europe 
such criticism has risen as constraints in the united states 
budget get tighter 
the european allies counter that most of the air land and sea 
forces of the north atlantic treaty organization are european 
its a question of convincing the us congress that what 
the europeans do reflects a fair assumption of the common 
defense burden said a senior nato official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he said nato ministers will set up a panel to review the 
financial issue and hope to present a report by years end 
carlucci will attend the meeting on his way to join president 
reagan at the moscow summit 
the nato defense chiefs also will approve goals for each of the 
16 members for 19891994 nato officials said the ministers were 
expected to adopt 26 longterm force goals 23 of these dealing 
with planning for arms systems to be operational by the late 1990s 
the ministers also will consider a multinational force to offset 
canadas decision to end the commitment of its airsea 
transportable brigade to reinforce northern norway in times of 
crisis the officials said 
canada announced a year ago that it would end its commitment in 
order to consolidate its forces in west germany 
the nato ministers were expected to ask italy to take in 72 us 
f16 jetfighters that are to be removed from the us air base at 
torrejon near madrid spains government under domestic political 
pressure asked for their removal 
in washington deputy defense secretary william h taft iv told 
the house armed services committee he expects italy will agree to 
be host for the 401st tactical fighter wing

after four decades of mindboggling spending 
for weapons and 15 years of gonowhere negotiations the 
superpowers are making hopeful noises about reducing military 
forces in europe 
it goes beyond the peace rhetoric president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev have voiced at their summits in geneva 
reykjavik and washington 
moscow has conceded for the first time that it does indeed have 
an advantage over the west in some military categories red army 
leaders hint they may no longer feel the need for such superiority 
it appears that in 1988 both east and west are ready for a new 
beginning says thomas j hirschfeld who spent 1979 to 1982 as a 
us representative to the multilateral mutual and balanced force 
reduction talks that have dragged on inconclusively since 1973 
reagan was said to be prepared to touch on the need for 
conventional disarmament in a speech in helsinki finland on his 
way to the may 29june 2 summit but theres no telling what he and 
gorbachev might do on the issue 
us officials are bracing for the possibility that gorbachev 
will suggest that the two superpowers meet this fall to discuss 
cutting their ground forces in europe by as much as 25 percent 
one official raised the possibility that gorbachev might wait 
until after the summit to announce a unilateral withdrawal of 
50000 to 70000 troops another official said 100000 troops could 
be pulled back 
after secretary of state george p shultz attended a presummit 
planning session with the soviets earlier this month there was 
little talk of conventional weaponry being a major topic at the 
summit optimism on the issue focused on the possibility of a 
midjuly agreement on a mandate for lower level negotiations the 
conventional stability talks 
before they begin such talks the western participants want 
further eastern european compliance with human rights accords 
signed in 1975 still us officials are hoping the problems can 
be settled in time for the cst conference to begin in october 
of course the cst talks will not reach agreement overnight 
and indeed it will be well into the next us presidents term 
before they produce results said former capitol hill staff 
member thomas longstreth in a study for the federation of american 
scientists 
with time and patience the logjam can be broken and a new era 
of stability in europe achieved longstreth wrote 
since the end of world war ii red army forces in europe have 
been dominated by huge armies of men tanks and artillery suitable 
for attack by pentagon estimates the soviets have 230 divisions 
compared with 121 for nato an edge of 52000to24250 in main 
battle tanks and a 42000to18350 edge in artillery 
the soviets have said they need such forces to keep the military 
balance in a speech last year however gorbachev acknowledged 
that asymmetries exist in the force comparisons and said the 
goal of each side should be reasonable sufficiency rather than 
superiority 
in a letter to a group of western scientists last november 
gorbachev said forces on both sides should be structured to 
provide all that is needed for the repulsion of any possible 
aggression but could not be used for offensive purposes 
there is no evidence the soviets have put such doctrines into 
effect and they note that there are asymmetries in favor of 
the west notably in the number of groundattack planes 
us experts like longstreth note as well that negotiations to 
reduce conventional weapons are a monumental prospect because so 
many different types of armaments units and national interests are 
involved 
state department officials have suggested that as a first step 
both sides should try to reduce forces that could be used in a 
surprise attack and should institute confidencebuilding measures 
that reduce fear of such an attack 
steps in that direction have already been taken under an 
agreement that has led to an increase in the number of observers 
each bloc has been sending to the other sides war games 
the nato allies will be paying particular attention to any 
developments in this field at the moscow summit now that 
mediumrange missiles are to be banned under the pact signed last 
december at the washington meeting the allies are zeroing in on 
conventional forces as their next arms control target 
under gorbachev the soviets have voiced an apparent 
willingness to embrace arms control concepts which just a few years 
ago would have seemed unattainable georgia democrat sam nunn 
chairman of the senate armed services committee said recently 
he added a word of caution is in order it is too soon to 
determine how many of these concepts can be translated into 
reality in areas such as conventional arms control we must put 
soviet rhetoric to the test with bold innovative proposals of our 
own

here is the text of president reagans veto 
message tuesday on the trade bill 
to the house of representatives 
it is with sincere regret that today i must disapprove and 
return hr 3 the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 
we worked long and hard to produce legislation that would 
enhance our countrys ability to meet foreign competition headon 
to strengthen our trade laws and remove restrictions on americas 
great economic engine 
and we came very close to developing such a bill 
unfortunately as the process came to a close provisions were 
included that simply make this bill on balance bad for america 
particularly working men and women 
the criteria i used in reaching this decision were whether this 
legislation will create jobs and help sustain our economic growth 
i am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our economic 
growth 
during this administration the american economy has created 16 
million new jobs 
our unemployment rate is the lowest in 14 years with more 
americans working than ever before in our history 
and we are experiencing the longest peacetime expansion this 
country has ever seen 
while this has been going on at home many of our trading 
partners have had a different economic situation 
perhaps the most compelling and important comparison is that 
over the past decade the united states has created more than twice 
as many jobs as europe and japan combined 
the united states economy which foreign leaders have dubbed the 
american miracle is not a freak accident or a statistical 
curiosity 
it is the result of seven years of consistent policies lower 
tax rates reduced regulation control returned to state and local 
governments 
the washington tendency to have government be all things to all 
people has been reversed and we have gotten government off the 
backs of the american people 
in contrast many foreign countries remain hamstrung by archaic 
policies and are now trying to remove these impediments to reform 
tax systems to make labor markets more flexible and to encourage 
entrepreneurs 
that is not to say that we cannot do more here at home we can 
that is why i forwarded proposals to improve our competitive 
strength and why we worked hard with the congress to try to achieve 
a positive forwardlooking bill 
unfortunately that is not the bill the congress passed and sent 
to my desk 
the issue receiving the most attention in this bill is the 
mandatory requirement for businesses to give advance notice of 
closings or layoffs 
i support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much 
advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes 
necessary 
it allows the workers the employer the community time to 
adjust to the dislocation 
it is the humane thing to do 
but i object to the idea that the federal government would 
arbitrarily mandate for all conditions and under all 
circumstances exactly when and in what form that notification 
should take place 
there are many circumstances under which such mandatory 
notification would actually force a faltering business to close 
by driving away creditors suppliers customers and in the process 
destroying jobs 
while the legislation attempts to mitigate this outcome its 
faltering business exemption is too ambiguous to be workable 
and invites untold litigation 
these concerns are real not simply philosophical or theoretical 
the experience of the caterpillar co in the early 1980s for 
example is indicative of the need to be flexible to meet foreign 
competition and indeed to survive 
they had to utilize layoffs and temporary plant closings to 
respond to competitive developments 
and as one executive of that company stated they did not have 
the luxury then nor do they now of knowing with certainty what 
business conditions would be like 60 days in the future 
without the ability to be agile and responsive they might have 
closed their doors permanently

caterpillars experience is repeated many times over throughout 
our economy 
one independent analysis shows that if this law had been in 
place between 1982 and 1986 the united states would have produced 
almost onehalf million fewer jobs 
and that is what this debate is about creating jobs and 
keeping them not losing jobs by the straitjacket of regulations 
over a year ago i submitted legislation that would provide 
assistance to workers employers and communities in the event of a 
layoff or closing 
the program would serve virtually every dislocated worker who 
needs it with training education and assistance in securing a new 
job and provide an incentive for giving advance notice of layoffs 
and closings 
ironically the one piece of that package that the congress 
rejected was a direct incentive for business to give advance 
notices of closing and layoffs 
we need labor laws that fit the flexible fastpaced economy of 
the 1990s not restrictive leftovers from the 1930s agenda 
and i encourage the congress in any subsequent trade bill to 
include a program that provides incentives for such notice 
there are other provisions in the legislation that provide 
disincentives to our sustained economic growth or serve some narrow 
special interests 
new restrictions on the export transportation and even 
utilization of alaskan oil further complicate the overbearing 
regulatory scheme that already impedes the development of alaskan 
oil fields 
it is the wrong policy we need to provide incentives not 
restrictions for the production of oil in the united states so 
that we can reduce our dependence on foreign suppliers 
further as the congress has now recognized it amounts to an 
unconstitutional discrimination against a single state 
a mistaken effort to revive discredited industrial policy 
planning through a soalled council on competitiveness that will 
open even more venues for special pleaders 
a requirement to negotiate a new centralized international 
institution to arrange the forgiveness of billions of dollars of 
debt around the world all supposedly without increasing us 
taxes or adding to our debt 
expanded ethanol imports that could harm us grain producers 
an amendment to the trading with the enemy act that prevents 
the president from moving swiftly to block blatant enemy propaganda 
material from entering the united states even during wartime 
while the congress did a remarkable job in watering down or 
eliminating the most protectionist provisions there remain 
sections of the bill that push us in the direction of protectionism 
closing our borders is not the solution to opening foreign 
markets 
we need to demand to be treated fairly and take a strong stand 
against barriers abroad 
in short we need to open markets not close them 
while there are objectionable portions of the bill there are 
also desirable provisions 
there is negotiating authority so that the next president will 
have congressional support to continue to seek agreements that open 
markets abroad 
that coupled with new trade law tools to strengthen the hand of 
america in international trade negotiations will mean that this 
country can enter the next decade with new agreements that reduce 
barriers and encourage trade 
there are strengthened protections for intellectual property 
such as copyrights and a reduction in various handicaps to us 
exporters 
finally the bill would remove a major impediment to us oil 
production by repealing the windfall profits tax 
that is why i want a trade bill and why i like much of this 
bill 
but i regret that the addition of a few counterproductive and 
costly measures outweigh the positive features of this particular 
legislation 
i will continue to work vigorously to secure sound legislation 
this year 
let me reiterate what i have said on a number of occasions 
i am committed to enactment of a responsible trade bill this 
year 
i have heard some say that there is not time to send me a second 
bill after my veto is sustained my response is that there are many 
months left in 1988 time to sign a trade bill this year 
i urge prompt action on a second bill immediately after the 
congress sustains my veto 
signed

the government said it will 
begin evicting 1800 blacks next month from a settlement designated 
for people of mixed race civil rights workers called the plan a 
revival of forced removals 
in another development state radio reported that a black had 
spoken for the first time in an official proceeding at south 
africas parliament building 
blacks make up 75 percent of south africas 35 million people 
but have no representation in parliament and no vote in national 
affairs 
in announcing the planned evictions at lawaiicamp white 
officials said on tuesday that the 40yearold black community is 
an illegal unsanitary squatter camp they deny the actions will 
constitute forced removal 
but residents of lawaiicamp say they are determined to stay 
where they are 
in 1984 president pw botha said there would be no more forced 
removals of the sort that resettled an estimated 35 million people 
from 1950 to 1983 
but critics say the policy continues under different names such 
as slum clearance and squatter control 
lawaiicamp adjoins the township of george which botha 
represented in parliament before becoming president in 1984 and is 
five miles from a scenic stretch of indian ocean coastline east of 
cape town 
the government wants to move lawaiicamp residents to sandkraal 
about a mile further from george which was established four years 
ago to be the areas official black township 
georges mayor john rogers told a news conference on tuesday 
that lawaiicamp residents have until may 31 to move voluntarily 
the town council plans to apply for eviction orders in court on 
june 1 and to demolish the 180 remaining lawaiicamp homes once they 
are vacated 
rogers said evicted families will be paid compensation and 
provided with new homes about 800 families have already moved from 
lawaiicamp to sandkraal and the government claims they enjoy 
better services and amenities 
the mayor said violence would not be used against residents 
resisting eviction but did not explain how this could be assured 
the current parliament member for george hennie smit said 
lawaiicamp is illegal because it is on land designated for use by 
people of mixed race a new mixedrace township is to be developed 
on the site 
in early 1986 the government tried to evict lawaiicamp 
residents but backed off because of legal challenges and stiff 
resistance this time the government says it will not yield 
the precedentsetting speech by a black at south africas 
parliament building came on tuesday during committee debate in cape 
town on the proposed budget for cape province 
temba nyati a black appointed last year to the provincial 
executive committee spoke about the importance of municipal 
government 
he later told the staterun south african broadcasting corp 
blacks should view participation in local government as a first 
step toward sharing power at higher levels 
a new constitution in 1984 created the asian and mixedrace 
chambers of parliament but still excluded the black majority from 
national affairs 
the white chamber is able to get its say on all major 
legislative issues

sen william proxmire says he will try to push 
stock market reform legislation to the senate floor next month 
even though reagan administration officials say that the need for 
such a measure is dubious 
proxmire chairman of the senate banking committee chided four 
federal officials who appeared before the panel on tuesday for 
producing a report on last falls stock market crash that suggested 
there is scant need for legislation 
i can tell you were going to go ahead with a bill said 
proxmire dwis 
proxmire told the authors of the study that they had made 
pitiful progress in formulating suggestions for calming the 
nations jittery financial exchanges and nervous investors the 
four officials were treasury undersecretary george d gould 
securities and exchange commission chairman david s ruder 
commodity futures trading commission chairwoman wendy gramm and 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
you have let down the american people at a critical time 
proxmire told the officials 
gould who headed the white house team that wrote the report 
sidestepped several questions about when the group would suggest 
needed legislation saying were not legislatively driven were 
decision driven 
the working groups report released may 16 suggested several 
mild steps for dealing with the markets ills 
they included a call for an hourlong trading halt in the 
nations stock futures and options markets if the dow jones 
industrial average plunges by 250 points in a single day such a 
decline has occurred only once last oct 19s 508point drop 
which has triggered on ongoing look at the markets volatility by 
the government and congress 
proxmire introduced legislation on march 31 that would establish 
a committee consisting of the chairmen of the federal reserve 
board the securities and exchange commission and the commodity 
futures trading commission the committee would oversee issues that 
affect all of the nations markets such as coordinating margins 
or downpayments exchanged in transactions and setting up 
circuit breakers to halt trading during emergencies 
my aim is to make sure that there is an accountable entity 
with both the responsibility and the expertise to make the 
decisions on intermarket issues proxmire said 
currently the cftc oversees the futures markets while the sec 
and the fed share responsibility for the stock and options 
exchanges 
after the hearing proxmire told reporters he expected his 
committee to send the legislation to the full senate in june 
with congress schedule abbreviated this year because of the 
elections and with some lawmakers joining the administration in 
opposing strong legislative action on the problem it seems 
unlikely that any bill will become law in 1988 
it makes it much harder to have the administration opposed 
proxmire conceded the president has the veto and the 
administration has influence with many members of congress 
sentiment on the banking committee on the need for legislation 
seems split and not along party lines 
while sen alfonse damato rny said wed be darned fools 
to say that all is well with the financial markets sen john 
shelby dala said a lot of us here dont believe you can 
legislate investors confidence 
ruder has dissented from his colleagues on several points 
arguing that futures margins should be raised and that the sec 
should oversee futures trading the sec meets thursday to fashion 
legislative proposals that will be submitted to congress by next 
week

karoly grosz hungarys new communist 
party leader said he will speed up economic reforms planned for 
late in the year but cautioned hungarians not to expect a swift 
economic turnaround 
he also conceded that since he became prime minister in june 
1987 his government has failed to revitalize hungarys sluggish 
economy 
thirty years of accumulated tension cannot be dissolved 
overnight he told the government newspaper magyar hirlap on 
tuesday in his first lengthy interview since being named party 
general secretary two days earlier 
the danger of the reform is the accompanying illusions many 
think that we shall pass 10 reforms and the countrys situation 
will change this is not so he said 
the 57yearold grosz will continue as premier at least until 
parliament announces a new head of government 
he replaced longtime party chief janos kadar a hardliner 
grosz said financial moves alone could not solve this nations 
economic crisis and acknowledged that some political change must 
accompany the new measures he said appointing new cabinet 
ministers and choosing a new head of government probably would take 
place this fall 
he praised kadar and said that the idea of naming kadar party 
president a new post that is expected to be largely ceremonial 
was the result of the past few weeks 
this indicated prolonged haggling over whether kadar who turns 
76 on thursday would give up the party leadership he held nearly 
32 years 
grosz said kadars new post would let him use his vast 
experience in international affairs an indication that grosz 
expects kadar to keep out of daytoday internal politics 
kadar was dropped from the politburo along with seven other 
party veterans in sundays reshuffle 
grosz said it is important that the new 11member politburo 
include such people as reszo nyers the father of hungarys 
economic reforms in the 1960s and imre pozsgay another outspoken 
advocate of political reform 
as premier grosz pushed stringent measures to curb hungarys 18 
percent inflation rate and 18 billion foreign debt but he 
admitted the austerity measures so far failed to halt stagnation 
a new party policy statement approved on sunday advocates more 
foreign investment joint ventures and loosening restrictions on 
the ownership of foreign capital 
it calls for changes allowing hungarians a greater voice in 
economic and political affairs including a major expansion of 
private initiatives 
hungarys economic crisis with the attendant loss of confidence 
in the communist party prompted the birth of many independent 
interest groups demanding a voice

congress is moving forward with legislation 
that could prevent another irancontra affair by establishing 
precise rules governing when a president must tell congress of 
dealings with terrorist countries 
in the latest attempt to turn the lessons learned from the 
affair into law the house on tuesday approved by voice vote a bill 
designed chiefly to prevent exports of military equipment to 
terrorist nations like iran 
but the legislation sent to the senate permits the president 
to deal with such countries if he believes the national interest is 
at stake and if he adheres to strict notification requirements to 
congress 
since the bill permits the president some flexibility the 
reagan administration does not oppose the legislation according to 
administration foreign policy supporter rep henry hyde rill 
the house bill is the second major attempt by congress to avoid 
another irancontra affair 
the senate earlier this year passed a bill which is still 
pending in the house that would require the president to notify 
congress of any covert intelligence operation within 48 hours after 
its authorization current law merely provides for timely 
notification 
the reagan administration considers that requirement too rigid 
and opposes the legislation 
the new house bill requires notification to congress in a much 
broader array of circumstances than just covert actions the 
coverage would include transfer of weapons and foreign aid money 
which may or may not be secret 
in the irancontra affair president reagan did not tell 
congress he had authorized the sales to iran until after the secret 
operation was revealed in a middle east publication 
iran is one of six nations designated by the state department as 
a terrorist country the other countries are cuba iran libya 
north korea north yemen and syria 
current law is supposed to prevent such weapons sales but 
failed to do so 
hyde a member of the former house irancontra committee called 
the bill one of the thoughtful responses to the irancontra 
hearings 
one of the big problems in the irancontra affair was the 
transfer of weapons to the iranians and nobody knew about it he 
said in this bill the president still has his constitutional 
power to execute his foreign policy functions 
the latest bill would prohibit any american from exporting arms 
to a terrorist state whether the individual is a government 
employee a private citizen or someone acting on behalf of the 
government 
the secret network that controlled weapons sales to iran and use 
of some profits to aid the nicaraguan contras was directed by 
former national security council staffer oliver l north he in 
turn enlisted two businessmen to run the logistics of the 
operations richard v secord and albert hakim 
under the legislation the state department would form its list 
of terrorist nations by determining whether a country repeatedly 
supported acts of international terrorism or granted sanctuary to 
international terrorists 
the president could delete a nation from the list but he must 
report to congress that a fundamental change in leadership and 
character has taken place that the country has not supported 
international terrorism for the preceding six months and that 
government provided assurances it would not support future acts of 
terrorism the deletion could not take place until 30 days after 
the report was submitted 
the legislation would require a validated license before goods 
or technology could be exported to terrorist states if such 
exports would significantly contribute to the military potential of 
the country or enhance its ability to support terrorism 
the state department must notify congress 30 days before issuing 
a validated license 
the president would be able to waive export restrictions for 
national security reasons and could provide foreign assistance to 
a terrorist nation for humanitarian purposes 
but first the president must give congress a 15day advance 
notification and a report containing all the details of the 
proposed transaction 
the legislation would retain current penalties for violating 
restrictions on exports or aid to terrorist countries a maximum of 
1 million in fines and 10 years in prison for criminal violations 
and up to 500000 for civil penalties

the united states will make new proposals at 
the moscow summit to keep track of elusive mobile missiles in a 
move to complete a treaty sharply reducing strategic nuclear 
arsenals secretary of state george p shultz said 
so far us and soviet negotiators have been unable to find 
ways to count the missiles that would be left on both sides if 
stockpiles are slashed this in turn keeps the superpowers from 
deciding whether to include mobile missiles in an arms reduction 
treaty 
while verification is extremely difficult the reagan 
administration is not ready to insist on banning the elusive 
weapons and give up hope of retaining some of these potent 
longrange missiles in the us arsenal shultz said tuesday 
they are harder to find so they are more survivable and 
therefore dont invite a first strike shultz told news agency 
reporters in a presummit interview so that adds something to 
stability 
but he acknowledged their elusiveness poses an extreme problem 
for arms control so you have to find a balance a compromise 
shultz said 
negotiations on a new treaty are stymied over the us 
antimissile program known popularly as star wars and over 
verifying reductions in mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried 
on fighter planes and warships 
the treaty is supposed to reduce us and soviet strategic 
weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent at the same time the two 
sides want to devise foolproof ways of verifying weapons are not 
retained illegally 
shultz said us negotiators in geneva had already proposed some 
ideas on how to keep track of mobile missiles at the moscow 
summit he said we will propose additional ones that refine 
things and give them more detail 
he said the reagan administration also would pursue at the 
summit a system for sending observers to suspect sites with little 
advance warning 
while the treaty cannot be completed in time for the summit 
shultz said there was still a chance of finishing it before 
president reagan leaves office next january 
its possible he said i dont know whether it will 
actually happen or not there are very knowledgeable people on both 
sides working to bring it about but the problems are very 
difficult 
and yet he said the soviets evidently want to keep at it 
instead of waiting for the next administration to take over 
they are in a negotiating process with people who are 
knowledgeable competent and are engaged shultz said so 
they as we want to make as much progress as is possible

attorney general edwin meese iii says there is 
widespread support in the reagan administration for legislation 
that would separate convicted narcotics smugglers from their 
passports 
meese made the comment as president reagan asked congressional 
leaders on tuesday for help in creating a bipartisan task force on 
drugs 
reagan has asked that the task force lay out its proposals in a 
report to him and the congressional leadership within 45 days 
one proposal it will almost certainly examine involves 
additional penalties for passport holders involved with drugs 
currently passports can be seized as evidence if someone is 
found to be smuggling narcotics into the united states 
but there is no penalty provision to deny convicted narcotics 
offenders their passports 
meese said he believes a majority of the cabinetlevel national 
drug policy board which he heads favors legislation to enact such 
a penalty 
he said legislation is being contemplated and that we will be 
proposing a lot of ideas in the course of these meetings with 
congress 
reagan named white house chief of staff howard baker treasury 
secretary james a baker iii and national security advisor colin 
powell as well as meese to the task force 
to date no members of congress have been named to the panel 
some members had criticized the proposal as offering more 
bureaucracy rather than concrete steps to battle the problem 
meese however said congressional leaders emphasized the need 
to move quickly and there will be further discussions in the next 
few days 
meese also told reporters there is no softening whatsoever 
of the reagan administrations zero tolerance antidrug policy 
despite modifications under which the coast guard will be more 
cautious about seizing boats outside the 12mile limit 
under the administrations zero tolerance policy law 
enforcement agencies are cracking down on illegal drug use no 
matter how small the amount 
with the new changes however vessels outside the 12mile limit 
found to contain drugs will be seized only when there is evidence 
of intent to smuggle them into the united states 
there have been some operational refinements but the policy 
remains the same meese said 
zero tolerance continues to be our policy both inside and 
outside the 12mile limit meese said but the attorney general 
acknowledged that federal law outside 12 miles does relate to 
quantities of narcotics indicating an intent to traffic in or 
smuggle 
one idea that has been jettisoned by the cabinetlevel drug 
policy board according to meese is the proposal by the us 
customs service to shoot down planes carrying drug smugglers 
in an interview with the washington post on tuesday customs 
commissioner william von raab declined to discuss specific 
antidrug proposals customs has made to the drug policy board but 
did call for an allout fight against drugs 
you must treat it like a war total mobilization total 
commitment he told the newspaper when you fight a war every 
man woman and child should be mobilized to that effort

the length of the average hospital stay has 
dropped since 1980 creating both real and false savings a 
researcher for the department of health and human services says 
the average number of days patients spent in hospitals declined 
from 11 percent to 15 percent in the early 1980s said dean farley 
deputy research manager of the hospital studies program in the 
national center for health services research and health care 
technology assessment 
although the decline has reduced health care costs for 
individuals the government and insurers in a sense theres a 
false sense of savings he said tuesday 
while patients are staying a shorter period in the hospitals 
they are going elsewhere and recuperating he said 
hospitals are reducing their costs he said insurers and 
the government are saving money but patients still need nursing 
care and they usually get it from family members he said 
the average hospital stay declined from 735 days in 1980 to 
571 days in 1985 according to the new york times which reported 
on the findings in todays editions 
farley said the decline has occurred even though hospitals are 
tending to admit patients who are sicker and who therefore stay 
longer but for some specific medical conditions the length of stay 
has been shortened he said 
he cited the example of women who used to be admitted to 
hospitals for stays of three to five days for normal delivery of 
babies now being discharged one or two days after delivery 
the decline has been very substantial and what has happened is 
that people who once were admitted for relatively short stays 
arent getting into the hospitals farley said instead he said 
they are treated as outpatients 
he said hospitals reacted to policies put in place by insurers 
and public agencies that believed hospital usage was excessive but 
he said the decline now presents a problem of excess capacity 
a report by the hospital studies program attributed the decline 
in hospital stays to several factors he said they include changes 
in reimbursement by government insurance programs like medicare a 
shift toward outpatient care increased use of second opinions 
changes in the ways hospitals are competing for patients growth in 
health maintenance organizations and other prepaid insurance and 
selective contracting by insurers who shop around among 
hospitals on the basis of costs 
he said the decline may be contributing to some hospital 
closings its not unusual to have them operating at 50 percent 
to 60 percent on average farley said 
he said hospitals face the challenge of what to do with the 
excess space the state of maryland was actively discussing about 
a year and a half to two years ago how to eliminate 20 percent of 
the hospital beds in the state he said i think those kinds of 
discussions are taking place all over the country 
but farley said the decline is leveling off 
lengths of stay have fallen as much as they are going to for a 
while but there are some questions in terms of caseloads and the 
kinds of patients that they are going to treat he said

education secretary william j bennett says 
the legalization of drugs would amount to an admission that 
protecting young people is too much trouble 
we are hearing this cry not because americans want to accept 
the costs of drug use but because some are afraid we cannot win 
this fight and that the cost of maintaining the war against drugs 
has become too great bennett told a convention of drug 
counselors tuesday 
he called talk of legalizing drugs a new development that may 
pull the rug out from under our efforts to stop drugs 
many of those calling for legalization point to the example of 
alcohol consumption as if legalized cocaine for example would be 
no worse bennett said that is not the point legalizing 
drugs even if such legalization were designed to prevent access to 
those substances by young people would almost certainly instead 
expand it 
he said the war against drugs has been difficult but that he 
cant believe society is ready to say its too much trouble to 
protect our young people from drugs the use of the military would 
cause some difficulties more law enforcement would mean spending 
more sound education is too much of a burden its just too much 
trouble for us adults to fulfill our basic responsibilities so 
lets open it up and let our kids take their chances 
bennett spoke at the second annual conference on drugfree 
schools 
no videotape no matter how useful and no curricular package 
no matter how well conceived can substitute for the action and 
example of educators parents and other adults in the community who 
teach young people the lesson that drug use is wrong he said 
schools need clear policies against the use and sale of drugs 
the most effective policies call for suspension of students caught 
using drugs and harsher penalties for those who sell drugs in 
order to prevent drug use form expanding a user must be treated 
firmly so that he cannot involve nonusers and so that his own 
drug use ceases

labor unions have been trying unsuccessfully 
for 15 years to require businesses to give employees notice of 
upcoming plant closings and largescale layoffs 
president reagans veto of the trade bill on tuesday is just the 
latest chapter in a tale that dates back to december 1973 when 
thensen walter f mondale dminn offered the first version of 
plant closing legislation 
mondale offered the measure after a minneapolis plant closing 
that put 1200 employees on the street on short notice with a 
seriously underfunded pension plan import competition was not the 
problem the company was moving its operations to iowa 
rep william ford dmich introduced a similar measure in the 
house a few months later citing similar problems in his district 
since then labor supporters of the concept and business groups 
that oppose it have butted heads with few results the us chamber 
of commerce the business roundtable and the national association 
of manufacturers contend the plantclosing provisions would tie 
managements hands and represent a first step in the 
europeanization of us industry and could bring the heavy 
jobless levels that afflict some european economies 
proponents scoff at such claims as pure scare talk they point 
to west german and japanese plantclosings laws already on the 
books and note that companies there are outpacing us rivals in 
the competitiveness race they also cite studies by the general 
accounting office and the bureau of labor statistics which show 
that about half of american workers who are laid off get a weeks 
notice or less 
advance notice helps workers because it warns them that their 
jobs are in danger before they find themselves out of work and on 
the street says one major supporter sen edward m kennedy 
dmass 
the plant closing provision in the trade bill is one of hundreds 
of features primarily aimed at turning around the nations trade 
deficit but it has come to overshadow the other provisions amid 
increasingly stern warnings from reagan that it would guarantee a 
veto of the entire bill 
the provision is simple enough it would require any company 
with 100 employees or more to give 60 days notice of impending 
plant closings or layoffs affecting at least 100 workers there are 
exceptions for firms in serious financial difficulties 
like supporters of the measure reagan says plantclosings 
notification are the humane thing to do 
i support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much 
advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes 
necessary it is the humane thing to do he said in his veto 
message to congress 
but i object to the idea that the federal government would 
arbitrarily mandate for all conditions and under all 
circumstances exactly when and in what form that notification 
should take place reagan said 
there are many circumstances under which such mandatory 
notification would actually force a faltering business to close 
by driving away creditors suppliers customers and in the process 
destroying jobs 
he cited the experience of the caterpillar co in the early 
1980s which he said had to use layoffs and temporary plant 
closings to respond to competitive developments 
as one executive of that company stated they did not have the 
luxury then nor do they now of knowing with certainty what 
business conditions would be like 60 days in the future reagan 
said without the ability to be agile and responsive they might 
have closed their doors permanently

jesse jackson on the eve of 
president reagans departure for the superpower summit called on 
the president and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to look beyond 
military solutions to the worlds problems 
the president goes to moscow frustrated in nicaragua the 
general secretary receives him defeated in afghanistan the 
democratic presidential contender told a world affairs council 
luncheon here tuesday the most powerful nations of the world 
confounded in seeking to control poor small nations on or near 
their borders 
after a certain point there is less and less relationship 
between military prowess and the ability to achieve political 
objectives jackson told the group 
reagan was leaving this morning for helsinki where he will 
remain until he flies to moscow on sunday for the start of the may 
29june 2 summit 
jackson said he would adopt a nofirstuse policy on nuclear 
weapons and conduct talks with the soviet union on bilateral 
reductions of conventional forces in europe 
and he called for ussoviet cooperation in tackling the 
problems of hunger and poverty around the globe 
he noted gorbachevs proposal that the superpowers work together 
on an exploration of mars and suggested that reagan reciprocate 
by suggesting a joint project to eradicate disease in the third 
world 
in his speech jackson also urged an end to the military buildup 
reagan has presided over 
after the largest military buildup in our history we must 
change our course or lose our way jackson said earlier this 
week he released a fiveyear budget plan that called for a freeze 
in military spending 
invest that money to educate our children provide health care 
to our parents and protect our environment this is not an act of 
charity it is a necessary part of defending our real security 
he said 
later jackson appeared at an antiapartheid rally outside the 
south african consulate he repeated his call for south africa to 
be designated a terrorist state and said he would urge that the 
proposal be made part of the democratic party platform 
we have a moral obligation to put south africa in the loop of 
terror to free people from this tyranny and gain our moral 
authority in this world he said 
jackson also hinted that his democratic rival frontrunner 
michael dukakis has not taken a sufficient interest in the issue 
he is not very conversant on our options in south africa 
jackson said of the massachusetts governor when we talk about it 
in more detail mr dukakis will see it as a terrorist state

doctors reported finding the first tentative 
evidence that chemotherapy may be able to help control lung cancer 
the nations leading cancer killer 
four studies presented at a medical conference produce at least 
a hint that platinumbased drugs combined with radiation and 
sometimes surgery may help prolong patients survival 
none of the research suggests anything close to a cure for lung 
cancer but doctors are encouraged by any improvement in a disease 
in which survival is measured in months rather than years 
there is no effective therapy for the vast majority of 
patients said dr robert capizzi of wake forest university in 
winstonsalem nc 
he said this makes the latest research presented tuesday at the 
annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology 
potentially important 
there is the possibility that drugs may for some subset of 
patients have important effects he said we dont have a 
prescription to be offered to the masses we have important new 
leads for controlled clinical trials 
about 150000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year 
the four studies were conducted on people with nonsmall cell lung 
cancer which accounts for about threequarters of all cases 
the most encouraging results were presented by dr robert o 
dillman of the scripps clinic of san diego 
like the other studies his was conducted on people whose cancer 
was too extensive to be removed surgically but had not spread 
beyond the chest typically such people are treated with 
radiation which slows but does not stop the disease 
he treated 240 patients with radiation and chemotherapy or with 
radiation alone 
he estimated that half of the patients receiving the combination 
would still be alive after one year compared with onethird of 
those who got only radiation 
our study is the first to show that chemotherapy may help at 
all in nonsmall cell lung cancer dillman said 
while the treatment may represent an advance he said this is 
not going to be enough more clinical trials will be needed to 
improve survival in this disease 
dr roscoe morton the north central cancer treatment group in 
rochester minn conducted a similar study using different 
chemotherapy drugs however in this attempt the drugs did not 
help people live longer 
we were not able to influence the outcomes by chemotherapy in 
addition to radiation he said 
the other studies used chemotherapy plus radiation to shrink 
tumors so they could be removed surgically 
in one directed by dr gary m strauss of st vincent hospital 
in worcester mass doctors were able to completely remove tumors 
from 10 of 41 patients treated 
he said the patients median survival is 17 months and there 
is a suggestion that this approach might be associated with longer 
survival 
a smiliar study was conducted by dr paul l weiden and 
colleagues at virginia mason medical center in seattle on 69 
patients he said there was no clear evidence that patients there 
did better 
the median survival of all patients is about 11 months which 
is comparable to what would happen with radiation alone weiden 
said we dont have evidence that all patients would benefit by 
this treatment it would appear to be a start to trying to improve 
the treatment

the federal aviation administration is 
preparing a formal regulation that could require the metal skin of 
older boeing 737s to be strengthened and reinforced the agencys 
administrator allen mcartor says 
the proposed regulation is expected to be formally announced 
within a week 
mcartors comments on tuesday came in the wake of last months 
inflight breakup of an aloha airlines boeing 737 a flight 
attendant was swept to her death when a 20foot section of the 
plane tore away the pilots managed to bring the aircraft to a safe 
landing but 61 people were injured 
the aloha plane was 19 years old and had made nearly 89000 
landings 
faa officials also reported on tuesday that a special inspection 
of 96 older boeing 737s begun after that accident found small 
cracks in one of every nine aircraft but none of a magnitude that 
they are cause for alarm 
anthony broderick the faas associate administrator for 
aviation standards said that of the 96 planes inspected under the 
order 10 were found to have some cracks the largest of which was 
onefourth of an inch he said none of the cracks should be 
considered alarming 
investigators believe that a 20foot section of the forward 
cabin wall and roof tore away from the aloha boeing 737 during 
april 28 flight because of a structural failure stemming from 
cracking and corrosion 
a week after the incident the faa directed that all boeing 737s 
with 30000 or more landings undergo a special visual inspection 
and those with more than 50000 landings be subject to additional 
inspections using highfrequency electronic equipment 
according to the boeing co there are 373 of the 737s worldwide 
with 30000 or more landings 212 of which operate in the united 
states and are subject to the faarequired inspections

gen manuel antonio noriega has been 
summoned before the legislature to report on negotiations with us 
officials over the nations lengthy political crisis 
the move on tuesday by the pronoriega legislative assembly 
would allow panamas military leader to present his position 
without appearing to take the initiative in divulging details of 
the talks 
by a 397 vote with five abstentions the 67member body 
summoned noriega to appear before it within 48 hours the chief of 
panamas 15000strong defense forces and the nations de facto 
leader did not immediately respond 
a similar move failed in the assembly on monday when 27 of 47 
legislators present voted for it passage required a twothirds 
majority of those present 
the united states has imposed a wide array of economic sanctions 
on panama in an effort to force the ouster of noriega who was 
indicted in february on federal drug smuggling charges in florida 
reagan administration officials want noriega to resign his post 
and leave the country at least temporarily 
if noriega appears before the legislature he will be asked what 
american negotiators have proposed what panamanian negotiators are 
trying to achieve and why the united states is taking part in the 
talks if it does not recognize the noriegacontrolled government of 
president manuel solis palma 
the white houses chief negotiator michael g kozak has been 
meeting with noriega representatives for nearly a month to try to 
resolve the crisis he returned to panama on monday after a brief 
trip to washington 
while a deal has been reported near on several occasions by 
reagan administration sources noriega has said in several recent 
appearances that he will not leave unless american economic 
sanctions are lifted and us aggression ends 
about 2000 american troops have been sent to panama in recent 
weeks to back up the 10000 soldiers already here assigned to 
protect the panama canal 
noriega also has said the united states must respect the 
presidency of solis palma who took over the presidency feb 26 
after president eric arturo delvalle tried to fire noriega and was 
deposed by the generals supporters 
delvalle recognized by the united states as the legitimate 
president of panama is in hiding in panama there is a warrant out 
for his arrest 
romulo escobar betancourt president of the promilitary 
revolutionary democratic party told local television stations on 
tuesday that the crisis would be resolved if the united states 
lifts the sanctions 
in five minutes he said the problem would be settled 
betancourt who has represented noriega in the talks with the 
united states also said we have totally rejected the fact that 
noriega has to leave the country 
noriega has denied the us drug smuggling charges which he 
contends are a political ploy to replace him with a less 
nationalistic leader who might tolerate a prolonged american 
military presence 
president reagan reportedly is considering dropping the 
indictments if it would lead to noriegas departure from power a 
position that has sharply divided his administration

9yearold daughter to watch sex acts but she refused penthouse 
magazine reports 
the article in the july issue is the first to report that 
swaggart engaged in sexual intercourse during any of the alleged 
sexual encounters that led to his removal from the pulpit by the 
assemblies of god church april 8 
in previous reports the prostitute debra murphree said 
swaggart paid her to perform lewd acts while he watched in a new 
orleans area motel last year 
swaggart head of the baton rougebased jimmy swaggart world 
ministries stopped preaching for three months but returned to the 
pulpit sunday without credentials from the assemblies the nations 
largest pentecostal denomination 
the penthouse interview is accompanied by explicit photos in 
which murphree demonstrates the acts she said swaggart asked her to 
perform 
she said she had at least 20 encounters with him during a 
oneyear period 
the issue containing the article is scheduled to go on sale in 
june but some copies were sold here tuesday 
swaggart has never admitted a sexual encounter but said from

william treeby an attorney for the ministries refused to 
comment on the penthouse article

the government today expressed relief after 
president reagan vetoed an omnibus trade bill that provides for 
sanctions against a japanese company and countries who violate 
international trade agreements 
japans relief was qualified however by a vote overriding the 
veto in the us house of representatives and the reasons behind 
reagans veto 
prime minister noboru takeshita speaking to reporters at his 
official residence welcomed the veto concern now is primarily 
on domestic issues in the united states takeshita said when 
the negotiations between reagan and congress begin the issues 
most affecting japan will be brought out 
japans minister of international trade and industry hajime 
tamura told a news conference our ministry has in the past 
requested efforts from the united states government to see that the 
trade bill would not be enacted and we welcome president reagans 
veto 
opposition to the bill in japan stems mainly from provisions 
requiring retaliation against violations of international trade 
pacts and other unjustifiable practices 
if enacted the bill would transfer from the president to the 
us trade representative the authority to decide what unfair trade 
practices another country is engaged in and what if any 
retaliatory measures to impose 
a provision imposing sanctions against toshiba corp and one of 
its subsidiaries toshiba machine co for the subsidiarys sales 
of sensitive equipment to the soviet union also concerns japan 
reagans veto message made no mention of the toshiba sanctions 
the message focused on curbs on exports of alaskan oil and a 
mandatory requirement forcing businesses to give employees advance 
warning of closures or layoffs 
toshiba machine corp sold the soviets milling machines that 
could be used to make submarine propellers quieter and more 
difficult to detect the sales violated international rules 
regulating trade between the west and communist countries 
tamura said he hopes congress will support reagan and that the 
bill will not pass but for us foreigners it is very hard to say 
what will happen in the united states he added 
the house overrode the veto with a margin well above the 
twothirds majority required but it was thought unlikely that the 
senate would go along when it considers the override after next 
weeks memorial day recess

montanas race for governor rocked by the 
sudden withdrawal of the incumbent and the unexpected death of his 
chief opponent has left the state with a jumble of more candidates 
than it has seen in 16 years 
the remaining candidates in the june 7 primary include montanas 
attorney general who is trying to overcome a drunkendriving 
conviction a former governor a former state supreme court 
justice three past and present legislators a drug 
addictturnedpreacher and a tax protester 
democratic gov ted schwindens decision last summer not to seek 
a third term saying he wanted concentrate more on his farm and 
family opened doors for candidates who had been unwilling to take 
on the popular incumbent 
then in early april a plane crash killed the republican 
frontrunner secretary of state jim waltermire leaving his 
supporters with a dilemma over which of the two remaining gop 
contenders to back 
the common thread running through the eightman campaign for 
governor the most crowded since 1972 has been economic 
development with the candidates offering ideas for infusing new 
life into montanas lackluster economy 
the two republican candidates former state sen stan stephens 
and state rep cal winslow are vying for the chance to end the 
democratic partys 20year reign in the governors chair 
both men have legislative backgrounds stephens has logged 16 
years in the senate and winslow has served eight years in house 
but the similarities end there 
stephens 58 has attracted support from the mainstream of the 
state republican party collecting support from former party 
leaders and longtime gop officeholders he boasts of his experience 
in senate leadership positions and as a successful businessman from 
northern montana 
winslow 38 has appealed to the younger elements of the 
republican party portraying himself as a conduit for attracting 
new business to the state 
the six democratic candidates include three serious contenders 
thomas judge who was governor from 1973 to 1981 is attempting 
a comeback after losing in the 1980 democratic primary to 
schwinden the 53yearold investment adviser has built his 
campaign on experience and an elaborate economic development plan 
i wont need four years of onthejob training he has said 
boasting of the states lucrative economy during his two terms as 
governor 
attorney general mike greely 48 overcame the stigma of a 1986 
drunkendriving conviction to enter the race hes called for a 
more aggressive program for marketing montana products elsewhere 
frank morrison jr who resigned as a state supreme court 
justice last year to run has emerged as the candidate most 
vehemently opposed to a retail sales tax 
seen as the most liberal of the democrats the 50yearold 
morrison has political roots in nebraska where his father was a 
threeterm governor 
the other democratic candidates are ted neuman a littleknown 
state senator and farmer emmett curly thornton a traveling 
evangelist who preaches on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse 
based on his own past addictions and martin red beckman a tax 
protester and author

harvard university has filed objections 
with the national labor relations board about a union vote by 
whitecollar workers charging that organizers used illegal tactics 
to gain a slim victory 
the university action tuesday was ordered by harvard president 
derek bok harvard officials claimed workers were intimidated or 
coerced as they voted may 17 in favor of unionizing 
a union officer said harvard was stretching it with the 
charges and had no evidence to prove the claim 
harvards 3300 clerical and technical staff members voted by a 
44vote majority to make the harvard union of clerical and 
technical workers their negotiating body the ivy league school 
fought the union drive with flyers inhouse meetings with 
supervisors and public statements 
the union drive was closely watched by national labor leaders as 
a benchmark for organizing whitecollar workers harvards prestige 
and the bitterness of the fight between the university and the 
union drew national media attention 
harvard worked very hard to ensure that staff members would be 
permitted to vote on may 17 in a fair and lawful process without 
being intimidated or coerced said anne taylor who coordinated 
harvards response to the union drive there is some evidence 
that the union did not share this principle 
taylor said 41 of those who voted for the union were ineligible 
to vote because of their jobs status as a result she said the 
actual margin could have been as small as three votes 
harvard charged that union representatives maintained lists of 
voters interrogated workers at the polls campaigned near polling 
places escorted workers to voting places and pressured union 
opponents not to vote 
harvards filing of the nlrb claim drew a rebuke from gerald w 
mcentee national president of the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees to which the harvard union belongs 
he called the charges an insult to the thousands of university 
employees who participated in this free and open election and an 
insult to the entire labor movement harvard has flunked its 
fairness report card 
chief union organizer kristine rondeau questioned the charge 
that she and others intimidated workers i dont think that i 
could intimidate a fly rondeau said its really stretching 
it 
rondeau said the university issued a questionnaire to the more 
than 3300 workers tuesday asking whether they noticed any pressure 
by the union on election day she denied that the union pressured 
anyone 
robert garner assistant regional director for the nlrb said 
the boards policy has been to conduct union elections in 
laboratory conditions as free from pressure as possible 
the nlrb could take from a month to more than a year to review 
harvards charges he said 
from the unions standpoint the worst that could happen is 
that they have to run the election over again garner said

an advocacy group accuses federal regulators 
of permitting lead concentrations in fresh florida grapefruit juice 
20 times that allowed in drinking water 
the environmental protection agency is closing its eyes to the 
extreme use of lead arsenate a chemical used to accelerate the 
ripening of grapefruit the national coalition against the misuse 
of pesticides said tuesday 
the last federal license to sell lead arsenate was surrendered 
earlier this year by the manufacturer microflo co of lakeland 
fla rather than conduct more tests that epa said were needed for 
its 10yearold review of arsenicbased pesticides 
in return for surrendering the license the company was 
permitted to sell remaining inventories up to 100000 pounds per 
year have been used recently enabling growers to earn almost 10 
million a year in extra profits by sending fruit to market early 
according to epa estimates 
the coalition says there is enough lead arsenate in florida 
distribution channels to serve growers for another two years

congress has approved legislation to restrict 
the use of a popular boathull paint that is effective against 
marine organisms like barnacles but which poses environmental risks 
the bill approved by voice vote in the house on tuesday would 
ban the use of paints containing organic tin additives on 
nonaluminum hull vessels less than 82 feet long the most widely 
used additive is tributyltin or tbt 
the measure would permit continued use of such paints on large 
vessels and those with aluminum hulls so long as the organic tin 
compounds are not released into the water at more than 4 micrograms 
per square centimeter a day 
paints with organic tin are much more effective against 
barnacles and marine algae than copperbased paints meaning lower 
maintenance costs for boat owners but testimony in the house said 
those paints can remain toxic for up to six months when released 
into the water

at least 20000 people fled in panic 
when a 40foottall kerosene tank caught fire at an oil tank farm 
in this northern city threatening adjacent tanks it was 10 hours 
before residents could return home 
no serious injuries were reported in tuesdays blaze at the 
storage facility operated by the government oil monopoly pemex in a 
residential area 
authorities said some firefighters suffered minor burns in the 
eight hours it took for them to bring the inferno under control 
about 900000 gallons of kerosene were in the steel tank when it 
ignited in an explosion at about 1010 am 1210 pm edt 
the government news agency notimex said area residents had been 
protesting the tank farms presence and the tanks were to have been 
relocated months ago but new facilities have not been completed 
the conflagration threatened 14 other tanks on the farm that 
were filled with millions of gallons of gasoline fire and smoke 
spiraled more than 150 feet above the plant 
fearing the worst authorities evacuated people living around 
the plant 
one estimate said as many as 200000 people fled their homes 
there were all kinds of accidents in the road the whole city 
was running away from the site said luis alonso hernandez 26 
who works at the plant you could see the flames and black smoke 
from miles away 
chihuahua 230 miles south of el paso texas has 550000 
residents and is the capital of chihuahua the largest of mexicos 
31 states 
the cause of the fire was under investigation but company 
officials said maintenance work was going on at the time of the 
explosion 
what we do know is that two men were soldering to repair a 
line at the base of the tank and that the top part exploded said 
francisco cortez coronado a plant spokesman 
there was an explosion but it was very muffled and then the 
fire started said plant foreman arturo rubio 
pemex workers and firefighters used water and foam to douse the 
blaze and cool off a nearby gasoline tank scorched by the flames 
the danger lasted about five hours rubio said it was a 
question of cooling off the other tank 
notimex said four tanks were very close to the burning tank 
it quoted the local fire chief as saying soldiers police and 
volunteers evacuated more than 100000 people from a twomile 
radius around the plant 
notimex later gave its own estimate of 200000 people evacuated 
and said hundreds of soldiers and rescue workers helped in the 
effort 
reporters at the newspaper novedades de chihuahua placed the 
number of evacuees at 20000 
city police spokesman lucia perez said it could only be 
estimated that several thousands of residents were evacuated 
from the nearby workingclass and middleclass neighborhoods 
pemex officials at the site said the tank that burned had a 
capacity of 12 million gallons and was threefourths full the 
other tanks on the farm contained regular and premium gasoline 
red cross radio dispatcher olga rojo said efforts to control the 
blaze were initially hampered by a scarcity of water much of 
northern mexico is suffering from drought this season 
on nov 19 1984 more than 500 people were killed at an 
explosion of storage tanks owned by pemex in san juan ixhuatepec a 
working class neighborhood on the northern outskirts of mexico city 
the disaster led to heated debate about locating oil and 
industrial complexes near residential neighborhoods

pat robertson supporters accusing party 
regulars in north carolina of plotting against them are 
threatening a boycott of next weeks state republican convention 
by not participating in a process designed to abuse our 
delegates we believe we are today making a positive protest that 
we hope will help deter similar behavior in the future sue 
wyatt the state chairman of robertsons organization said tuesday 
ms wyatt accused state gop chairman jack hawke of stacking key 
committees and levying a fee of up to 150 for convention delegates 
in an alleged effort to deter robertson supporters from attending 
although robertson got less than 10 percent of the vote in the 
march 8 presidential primary his supporters packed many precinct 
and county conventions often comprising a majority 
bush supporters say state law gives their candidate a right to 
his choice of at least 29 of north carolinas 54 national gop 
convention delegates based on his victory in the primary they say 
dole who finished second won the other 25 delegates who would be 
uncommitted because he quit the race

traded charges of incompetence and unethical conduct with 
challenger lacey t smith in perhaps the most heated primary on the 
ballot tuesday

have said no a loud no to the type of campaigning that weve seen 
in this race the 50yearold congressman said after receiving 73 
percent of the vote in the most bitterly contested race 
with all but four of the districts 491 precincts reporting 
unofficial returns hubbard received 62251 votes to 22828 votes 
or 27 percent for smith a 48yearold businessman who moved from

hubbard of incompetence and improperly investigating a loan smith 
had received 
roll call a washington weekly that calls itself the newspaper 
of the congress had labeled the campaign the nastiest in the 
country

the state attorney general said he 
will seek contemptofcourt charges against the mother of a black 
teenager who claims she was abducted and raped by a group of white 
men 
attorney general robert abrams said tuesday he found it ironic 
that dozens of friends neighbors and acquaintances of tawana 
brawley will talk to investigators but that the teenagers own 
family continues to resist the probe 
miss brawleys mother glenda has defied a subpoena to tell a 
grand jury investigating the case about her daughters allegations 
of sexual abuse at the hands of six white men the brawleys say the 
incident was racially motivated 
the strategy of defiance and noncooperation on the part of 
the family and their representatives continues to impede our 
investigation from learning the full story of what happened to 
tawana brawley abrams said 
abrams called the situation unfortunate and regrettable and 
said the blame must be shared by the brawleys representatives 
attorneys alton maddox jr and c vernon mason and the rev al 
sharpton 
mason and sharpton have called abrams and gov mario cuomo 
racists and insisted that abrams step aside as special prosecutor 
in the case 
mrs brawley talked about her daughters case on a new york city 
radio station tuesday at the same time she had been summoned to 
appear before the grand jury here 
i could not get any justice so i went to the black community 
and i got all the power that i need to back me to help me to fight 
for my daughter said mrs brawley who was interviewed on 
station wlib with tawanas stepfather ralph king and the familys 
advisers 
mason and maddox said they are eager to explain the reasons for 
defying the subpoena a hearing on the contempt allegation will be 
sometime next week said abrams spokesman timothy gilles 
the 16yearold wappingers falls girl was missing for four days 
before she was found nov 28 in a dazed state with racial epithets 
and excrement smeared on her body she said that white men one of 
them with a badge had abducted and raped her 
miss brawley has refused to cooperate with investigators her 
only statements about what happened have come through her family 
authorities have not be able to find evidence to corroborate her 
story 
after allegations by attorneys for miss brawley that local 
investigators could not be impartial cuomo assigned the case to 
abrams 
if found in contempt mrs brawley could be jailed for up to 30 
days or fined 250 abrams said

despite assurances of better services 
voters in several resort communities decided against forming the 
city of lake tahoe after casinos helped wage a vigorous advertising 
campaign against the move 
the vote tuesday was 1001 against and 802 for the plan the 
issue prompted an unusually high turnout of 60 percent said 
douglas county clerk barbara reed she said a normal turnout was 
3540 percent 
the proposed city with a population of about 6500 would have 
embraced the casino area of stateline and smaller communities along 
about 15 miles of lake tahoes southeastern shore 
the proposal lost in all the lakeshore communities although 
proponents had argued that the communities which make up 25 
percent of douglas countys population do not receive a 
proportionate share in services of the 60 percent in tax revenue 
they contribute 
ron nino leader of the opposition said he was very pleased 
with the vote adding we believed there was going to be a 
substantial tax increase people will pay more for more but we 
didnt see where there was going to be more we saw the same or 
less 
the opposition received financial support from the stateline 
casinos whose tax burden nino said would rise by at least 300000 
yearly under a city government 
the tax scare did it admitted bill bigham a leader of the 
movement to create the city i think that did us in perhaps 
along with mixing it with the highway patrol opponents also 
argued there would be fewer or no state trooper patrols in the area 
if the city was created 
the ads that came out in the paper were rather overwhelming 
bigham said while we had some good editorials in the paper and 
some people sponsored their own ads for the city we just didnt 
have the money to spend on it that the opposition did 
commissioners of douglas county which would lose about 18 
million in yearly tax revenue to the city mostly from the big 
stateline casinos had advised voters to reject the plan 
communities in california on the western side of the lake also 
had complained about the plan saying the name lake tahoe would 
create confusion between the lake and the city

thousands of evacuated residents waited to 
return home today while many others faced commuting headaches as 
propane from an overturned tank truck burned for a second day 
the fire was so intense and potentially explosive that 
firefighters were prevented from approaching the burning truck 
loaded with about 2500 gallons of propane instead unmanned 
pumpers threw water on the blaze

hours or until about 330 pm today if no explosion occurred

authorities released from jail six 
americans and four other foreigners charged with violating the 
countrys territorial waters but kept them under city arrest until 
a court decides their case 
the group includes three australians and a briton and some 
members threatened monday to launch a hunger strike to try to 
expedite the proceedings the 10 were arrested march 22 for 
allegedly entering indonesian waters without a proper permit in the 
eastern sumatra province of riau a few miles south of singapore 
a local news report quoted one of the americans as saying the 
group was on a scuba diving holiday looking for a sunken wreck when 
they were arrested 
indonesian newspapers said that in 1986 the crew of a british 
vessel the ocean pluto had recovered 15 million worth of china 
and gold bullion from the wreck of a dutch ship the geldermalsen 
that sank in 1752 near where the 10 were found by the authorities 
public prosecutor halius hosen said the foreigners were not 
charged with illegally hunting for treasure the charge is that 
they have entered indonesian waters and held scientific research 
without proper permit 
hosen said by telephone today that the group was released from 
jail may 5 in the provincial city of tanjung pinang but they are 
not allowed to leave 
he said some of the foreigners denied the charge and some had 
threatened to go on a hunger strike after a preliminary court 
hearing monday during which the trial was adjourned until june 2 
the prosecutor said he did not know whether the protesters had 
begun a hunger strike he also said he had not decided what 
punishment to seek for the defendants 
hosen refused to link the foreigners detention with the 
geldermalsen wreck which was left there by the british divers in 
1985 
the six americans all from california were identified as 
daniel m commerford 38 robert alan lanham 34 and bruce edward 
lanham 34 patrick gilbert gibson 47 clifton bert craft 43 and 
james e vorus 46 
the australians are peter john howes 30 martino paul kenneth 
40 and paul martino jr 17 the briton is mark tomlinson 26 
no hometowns were available and none of the 10 could be reached

masked workers spent two days cleaning out 
the ratinfested home of a 71yearold woman who authorities said 
allowed more than 20 tons of garbage to pile up for 20 years but 
more work remained 
the odor was so offensive i couldnt breathe pomona fire 
inspector george barrigan said tuesday after cleanup crews dug 
their way through the filth sometimes ducking to avoid hitting 
their heads as they walked on garbage piled three feet deep 
theres everything imaginable in there clothes rotting 
food rats bugs you name it its unbelievable said pomona 
fire chief tom fee he estimated the cleanup which began monday 
would be completed today 
masked excavation workers used shovels and a tractor to scoop up 
the garbage and haul it away 
homeowner erleen burman 71 was unhappy with the cleanup 
however protesting that she had been accumulating the contents of 
the home for years the singlestory home sits in a neighborhood of 
100000 houses 
its my whole life she said 
ms burman concedes she hasnt cleaned her house in years 
ive been sick for 20 years im trying to find another husband 
i need somebody to help me you know paint the house and help pay 
for the food 
the retired hairdresser said she sleeps but doesnt eat in her 
home 
i struggle off somewhere to get something to eat and then come 
back here for a rest she said adding she frequently visits her 
daughters home 
as workers sorted through the rubble tuesday she pointed at 
piles of filth and said this isnt all mine she shook her 
head vaguely and said my husband then her voice trailed 
off 
twenty tons of garbage and seven refrigerators were removed from 
the homes back yard by a private contractor hired for 4000 ms 
burman must pay the costs 
i carried out stacks of wood completely rotten with 
termites said contractor curnelius king i flipped over a 
refrigerator and a rat jumped straight in the air 
fire department officials originally became aware of the filth 
five or six years ago while investigating a fire call that turned 
out to be a false alarm fire capt terry staudenmayer said they 
were unable to do anything at that time he said 
if its not producing rats we cant do anything he 
explained adding the case was then turned over to the los angeles 
county health department 
the fire department was called back march 19 because ms burman 
hadnt been seen for some time and neighbors were describing 
hundreds of rats on the roof staudenmayer said

idahos lessthansuspenseful republican 
presidential primary added another win to vice president george 
bushs column michael dukakis cruised to an easy victory in the 
democratic beauty contest 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting bush had 82 percent 
of the vote to 9 percent for pat robertson who suspended his 
campaign earlier this month to rejoin the christian broadcasting 
network 
bush was winning 15 of the 18 national convention delegates at 
stake in the lackluster primary tuesday with two going to 
robertson and one in the uncommitted column 
dukakis was pulling in 73 percent of the vote to 16 percent for 
jesse jackson with only a handful of precincts still unreported 
sen albert gore jr had 4 percent and sen paul simon 3 percent 
both have suspended their presidential campaigns 
the democratic vote was not binding dukakis the frontrunner 
claimed a majority of the delegates at caucuses two months ago 
with no statewide elected offices at stake this year and the 
presidential candidates all but formally crowned there was little 
to draw idaho voters to the polls beyond a handful of heated 
legislative and local races 
for various reasons the presidential election and others 
neither we nor the county clerks are seeing very much intensity in 
this one deputy secretary of state ben ysursa said 
in congressional primaries state rep jeanne givens rolled up a 
large victory over two challengers to take the democratic 
nomination to face fourterm republican congressman larry craig in 
the 1st district 
former state sen dane watkins won the republican nomination to 
challenge twoterm democratic congressman richard stallings this 
fall in the states 2nd district 
bush made a 19hour campaign swing through idaho earlier this 
month to bolster his support in a state that has not given its four 
electoral votes to a democrat since lyndon johnson in 1964 
democrats allotted 18 of their 24 nominating delegates in super 
tuesday caucuses held on march 8 dukakis captured eight of them 
jackson four and six were uncommitted 
since then however gov cecil andrus one of the six 
previously uncommitted super delegates has endorsed dukakis 
and urged others to do the same so the party is clearly unified for 
the november assault on the white house 
although there has been no statewide polling conducted a 
democratic poll this spring in the conservative 2nd congressional 
district of southern idaho showed dukakis only 2 percentage points 
behind bush 
but its a long time to the finish line said state senate 
president pro tem james risch of boise bushs state chairman 
the people will have a choice between a person who knows the 
issues and a governor of a state that really hasnt done very 
well

a retiree described by neighbors as a 
recluse is accused in federal court documents of having been 
secondincommand of a system of nazi slavelabor camps during 
world war ii 
the justice departments office of special investigations filed 
a civil complaint tuesday claiming that juris kauls of sun city 
west believed to be 75 years old was the deputy chief and 
inspector of guards in 1941 and 1942 for 14 concentration camps at 
riga latvia 
the concentration camp was a place of persecution for its 
prisoners says the complaint filed in us district court 
such persecution included the incarceration of civilians 
solely because of their race religion political beliefs or 
national origin 
according to the complaint the camps prisoners were used 
primarily for slave labor but some were beaten starved and 
executed 
it was a terrible facility but not as wellknown as 
auschwitz said neal sher director of the office of special 
investigations in washington 
the office requested that kauls who moved to arizona from 
indianapolis be deported because he allegedly concealed his 
involvement with the nazis in order to become a naturalized us 
citizen 
kauls entered canada in february 1951 entered the united states 
in 1954 applied for permanentresident status in detroit and 
became a us citizen april 13 1960 according to the complaint 
a woman who answered the door at the kauls residence and 
identified herself as kauls wife was asked about the allegations 
thats not possible we are united states citizens she said 
she refused to talk further with reporters 
neighbors said the couple rarely left their home in the 
retirement community except to go shopping 
nazi hunters at the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust 
studies in los angeles and the jewish antidefamation league in new 
york said they were not familiar with kauls

a weekend fisherman who enlisted the american civil 
liberties union to fight the federal governments zero 
tolerance policy says he is outraged over the coast guards 
seizure of his boat for absolutely nothing 
aclu lawyer barbara s levenson said us customs has two days 
to return the boat of jean sebastian gros 28 before the miami 
aclu chapter plans to go to federal court seeking an injunction 
against the coast guard and customs for return of the boat 
she said she filed a petition tuesday with customs for the 
23foot boats return 
the day before coast guard and customs service officials 
announced they were slightly refining the use of the reagan 
administrations policy under which boats cars and other vehicles 
have been confiscated if even a trace of illegal drugs is found in 
them 
the modifications prohibit the coast guard from seizing boats 
outside the 12mile territorial limit if there is no evidence of 
intent to smuggle apart from those changes however attorney 
general edwin meese iii said tuesday there is no softening 
whatsoever of the policy 
ms levenson said the aclu is lining up challenges because she 
is afraid we may be approaching a police state 
we feel that mr gros represents many many recreational boat 
users who enjoy their boats who are not drug dealers but 
merely mr and mrs john q taxpayer she said the reason for 
zero tolerance does not justify suspension of the constitution 
gros a plantation resident said tuesday he is outraged over 
the may 15 confiscation of his new 40000 boat by the coast guard 
he uses it for his recreational fishing excursions to the bahamas 
they went through everything i mean my entire boat said 
gros a service station owner who insists he neither uses illegal 
drugs nor condones their use 
we had absolutely nothing on board they never showed me what 
they found gros said they say they scraped up six grains 
approximately a gram and it tested positive for thc the active 
ingredient in marijuana its simply not true 
gros said his boat was searched by two armed coast guardsmen 
confiscated 7 miles off the bahamanian island of bimini which is 
beyond the 12mile limit and impounded at the coast guard station 
in miami beach about 45 miles away 
coast guard lt cmdr james simpson said the robalo at first 
stopped for the coast guard then took off running and was 
chased for about five minutes before being boarded 
the boarding team found about half a gram of substance on the 
deck in the open behind the seat tested that and it came up 
positive simpson said based on one the vessel fleeing 
boarding by a coast guard vessel and two finding a quantity of 
controlled substance a further search was authorized simpson 
said 
small quantities of what tested as marijuana were subsequently 
found on the boats console and in a mop he said

a group of up to six israeli diplomats will 
leave for moscow possibly by next week as the first israelis to 
take up consular duties there in 21 years officials and news 
reports said today 
the soviets agreed to issue visas to the israelis at a secret 
meeting in zurich switzerland on monday said foreign ministry 
political adviser nimrod novick who negotiated for the visas 
novick told israeli army radio the diplomats main job in moscow 
will be to administer an embassy building for which israel has been 
paying monthly rent even though it has been empty for 21 years 
agreement for the visas came 10 months after soviet consular 
officials began operating from the finnish embassy in tel aviv 
novick said he hoped the consular visit to the soviet union 
could lead to renewal of full diplomatic ties with moscow but 
described the current agreement as less than a breakthrough 
what we are talking about is dipping ourselves in the water to 
check if it is hot or cold it remains to be seen when our 
delegates reach moscow how well they will be received novick 
said 
he added that the agreement followed two months of secret 
contacts with vladimir terrasov the deputy head of the soviet 
foreign ministrys middle east department 
the soviet union broke diplomatic relations with israel during 
the 1967 middle east war when the jewish state captured the west 
bank gaza strip and golan heights from the kremlins arab allies 
kremlin leaders have improved ties with israel in the last two 
years largely as part of an effort to become involved in 
peacemaking efforts in the middle east 
the soviets held numerous meetings with israelis abroad and then 
sent an eightmember consular team to israel in july 1987 
the israeli diplomats will number as many as six and work from 
the dutch embassy in processing visas for soviet jewish emigrants 
israeli news reports and officials said 
there was no date set for when the visas would be issued but 
one foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the israeli diplomats could be on their way to moscow as early 
as next week 
the yediot ahronot daily said the visas may come this week or in 
advance of the superpower summmit in moscow 
novick indicated that israel had sought a broader role for its 
diplomats which would include handling visas for soviet jewish 
emigrants 
it looked like it was broadening things to the soviets 
novick said adding that now there is no argument between us and 
the soviets that our group will have a mandate as outlined to 
check out the israeli embassy building in moscow 
he added that the soviets had agreed there would be no 
restrictions placed on other contacts between the israelis and 
jews in the soviet union

jersey citys schools are in an advanced 
stage of decay new jerseys education commissioner charged in 
announcing the state will attempt to seize control of the 
32000student district 
it would be the first time a state has taken over such a big 
urban district new jerseys secondlargest said the national 
governors association in washington 
education commissioner saul cooperman citing rampant political 
patronage mismanaged schools and chronic failure to educate the 
districts students began efforts to take over the district on 
tuesday 
the school system in jersey city an ethnic melting pot of more 
than 200000 people many of them recent immigrants has come under 
fire for poor test scores and a high dropout rate the city is 
across the hudson river from new york city 
an independent auditors report cited by the state also charged 
that jobs in the school system are treated as political paybacks 
and courses are so outdated that one on africa failed to list 17 
countries formed since 1958 
as is true of other enterprises that reach such an advanced 
stage of decay the jersey city school district offers a compelling 
case for bolder more decisive and nontraditional intervention by 
higher public authorities cooperman said at a news conference 
the commissioner said district administrators are incapable of 
properly running the schools or fixing widespread problems 
political patronage union pressure and cronyism is a 
consistent motivation at all levels in the hiring firing and 
promoting of staff he said 
under new jersey legislation enacted five months ago cooperman 
could abolish the local board of education fire the superintendent 
and top administrators and appoint a state superintendent to 
operate the schools for at least five years 
the law gives new jersey officials some of the broadest powers 
in the nation to take control of deficient school districts 
the district has 10 days to accept coopermans decision or 
respond with reasons why it shouldnt be taken over 
jersey city board of education spokeswoman leslie silberman said 
the panel would not comment on coopermans recommendation until 
reviewing the report 
meanwhile the state division of criminal justice is to 
determine whether local officials have committed any crimes 
auditors found inadequate record keeping missing contract 
documents and questionable payroll personnel and procurement 
practices the district has wasted more than 12 million on an 
improper health insurance plan the report said 
richard kaplan who ran a separate investigation for the state 
said employees routinely were rewarded or demoted based upon which 
mayoral candidate they backed in the democratic stronghold 
in addition curriculum guides in jersey city are so outdated 
that a course guide for a high school class on africa fails to list 
17 countries formed between 1958 and 1980 and lists four countries 
that no longer exist 
teachers werent optimistic tuesday that state control would end 
the districts problems 
mike bogart a grammar school teacher said over time rules 
have been forgotten and replaced with double standards we cant 
come back but i guess weve got to try bogart said 
schools superintendent franklin williams has said if the 
district were properly funded the state would not need to take it 
over 
he also said that conditions are not as bad as the state 
maintains and that many problems stem from the citys high crime 
rate and drug problems and poverty among district students many 
of whom are homeless or do not speak english 
cooperman countered that the district has enough money but it 
hasnt been properly spent its bleak he said ive read 
everything and respect the superintendent the facts are stubborn 
things

and continued through tuesday morning in the southwestern town of 
nanchong in sichuan province the sports news said

how many fans were hurt 
the incident appeared symptomatic of growing violence in chinese 
society in the past few years one the one hand official control 
over peoples lives have relaxed somewhat but frustrations have 
risen because incomes have not soared as quickly as expected

teams

after police escorted the players to a local police office and a 
hotel the mob broke hotel windows and stole stores of cigarettes 
and beer several dozen other people broke into the police office 
damaged several rooms and stole cattle prods handcuffs cameras 
and firefighting equipment the newspaper said 
police beat and arrested 43 people at the station it said 
the violence basically subsided by morning it said and the 
local and prefectural governments convened emergency meetings to 
discuss the riot 
it was not the first time sports passions translated into 
violence in china 
in 1985 angry fans threw rocks and bottles attacked police and 
spat at foreigners in beijing after hong kongs soccer team 
defeated china 21 in world cup qualifying play five youths were 
charged with hooliganism 
the same year fans in shijiazhuang 150 miles southwest of 
beijing stoned a referee and smashed seven vehicles when the

a judge has ordered a young woman to remain on 
birth control for the rest of her childbearing years for 
abandoning her two young sons in a sweltering apartment last summer 
debra ann forsters attorney and the head of the american civil 
liberties union in arizona objected to the sentence tuesday as a 
violation of the 18yearold mesa womans constitutional rights 
superior court judge lindsay ellis budzyn sentenced ms forster 
to lifetime probation and ordered her to give regular written proof 
to her probation officer that she is on birth control 
your case represents the epitome of whats wrong with our 
society a child having children the judge said 
ms forster pleaded guilty in april to two counts of attempted 
felony child abuse 
her estranged husband found the two boys ages 18 months and 6 
months in the apartment where police say they had been left alone 
for two days 
the children were suffering from malnutrition dehydration and 
lesions caused by a rash and were hospitalized in serious condition 
for eight days 
police said ms forster told them she left the children because 
she was unable to cope with the pressure of caring for them she 
said she had used drugs to escape from the pressures and had 
attempted suicide police reported 
louis rhodes executive director of the aclu in arizona called 
the sentence a stunning violation of a persons right and 
robert billar a deputy public defender said it violated her right 
to privacy 
but the judge said ms forsters lack of nurturing and the 
close call the children had with death merited such an order 
the judge also barred ms foster from seeing her sons or the 
daughter she bore in prison two months ago she also was told that 
she cannot babysit for others 
court records show that ms forsters daughter has been adopted 
and that her sons also have been put up for adoption 
i know i did something wrong and i have to pay for it im 
sorry a tearful ms foster she told the judge

thousands of people caught a longawaited 
glimpse of two giant pandas that went on display at the toledo zoo 
over the objections of a conservation group that wants the 
endangered animals returned to china 
the exhibit which began tuesday after nine months of planning 
marks the first time the chinese have permitted two pandas to be 
exhibited together at a us zoo the animals are on loan to the 
zoo until aug 21 
le le and nan nan made their debut before an invitationonly 
crowd of about 250 later the zoo opened its gates to hundreds who 
had waited in line since dawn 
about 5000 people visited the zoo on tuesday zoo spokeswoman 
betsy clark said the zoo has between 2000 and 3000 visitors on 
an average weekday up to 1 million are expected to see the pandas 
by the time the display ends 
theyre so cute said lorraine grove 18 of port clinton 
i waited on line for three hours but it was definitely worth 
it 
the international world wildlife fund contends the exhibit could 
endanger the pandas and had gone to court to prevent the animals 
from going on display 
in washington the wildlife fund asked a federal court tuesday 
to shut down the exhibit charging it represents commercial use of 
the pandas in violation of the endangered species act and an 
international wildlife convention 
the group asked for an expedited hearing which is expected to 
be set after the us fish and wildlife service files its response 
within five days 
it is the first shortterm panda exhibit in which both animals 
are of prime breeding age and were taken from a captive breeding 
and research facility said kenneth cook spokesman for the 
wildlife fund 
it is no exaggeration to say that among zoo professionals and 
conservationists these might be considered to be among two of the 
most valuable animals on the planet 
the zoo has spent nearly 3 million in preparing to exhibit the 
pandas including 19 million for their quarters edwin bergsmark 
president of the toledo zoological society said the exhibit is 
aimed primarily at children 
they are perhaps the last generation that will be able to 
enjoy seeing the giant pandas if the immense conservation efforts 
being employed by the chinese do not receive unified support from 
the conservation world he said 
viki billis and her 21monthold son andrew were among the 
first in line 
this is very exciting for toledo we needed this every mother 
and father should take time out and bring their children to the 
zoo mrs billis said

a soviet army spokesman today said that 13310 
soviet troops have been killed in afghanistan and 35478 wounded 
since the soviet union entered the afghan war in december 1979 
in the first official statement on casualties from the war gen 
alexei d lizichev head of the army and navy political 
departments also told a news conference that 311 soviets had 
disappeared they are believed to have been captured by rebels 
or to have deserted 
the figures through may 1 were higher than western sources had 
estimated a us state department report in late 1987 estimated 
there had been 33000 to 38000 casualties about a third of which 
were deaths 
lizichevs casualty figures were in line with a may 19 statement 
from eduard rosenthal commentator for the official novosti press 
agency that news reports estimating fatalities between 12000 and 
15000 were more or less correct 
lizichev said 9500 of the soviet officers and troops in 
afghanistan have left their bases since the pullout began may 15 
he refused to give a figure for the soviet force in afghanistan 
before the pullout began but western estimates say they numbered 
about 115000 
deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov and lizichev held fast to 
the kremlin position that soviet intervention in afghanistans 
civil war was justified soviet troops had been invited to 
afghanistan by the government vorontsov said that is a fact 
this cannot be reassessed 
asked whether the retreat signaled an end to the brezhnev 
doctrine the kremlin policy developed under late leader leonid i 
brezhnev of military intervention to protect socialist revolutions 
vorontsov said past practices do not apply to the new kremlin 
vorontsov said the soviet armed forces are committed to 
protecting allies but did not make clear whether that protection 
extended to ideological threats 
lizichev said soviet policy has not changed that it was only 
recently that there were conditions that allowed the kremlin to 
leave afghan government troops to fight on their own against the 
moslem guerrillas 
soviet officials and the staterun media have cast the pullout 
as a successful conclusion to an intervention that has inflicted 
heavy damage on international relations as well as on the soviet 
public 
the afghan government meanwhile charged for the fourth time in 
recent days that pakistan is violating the peace accord that led to 
the start of the soviet withdrawal the official soviet news agency

edwin meese iii for a top justice department post said today he 
accepted the position without hesitation despite ongoing criminal 
investigations of the attorney general 
edward sg dennis jr the us attorney in philadelphia said 
he did not talk to meese about an independent counsels 
investigation of the attorney general when he was tapped for the 
job 
no we did not discuss that at all dennis said on cbstvs 
this morning program i feel that the process with regard to 
the independent counsel is going forward and that will resolve 
itself and in any case the criminal division still has a mission 
which hopefully i can help fill 
dennis said he accepted the post as assistant attorney general

consideration 
dennis said he had not spoken with his predecessor weld about 
his reasons for leaving he said if theres a morale problem in 
the criminal division he plans to try to do my part to 
overcome it

million from a developer to obtain city council approval to build a 
waterfront development

defense minister dmitri t yazov says soviet 
soldiers in east germany lack discipline and battle preparedness 
the ministry daily krasnaya zvezda reported today 
red star said yazov addressed a special meeting of senior army 
officers from the east german detachment estimated by western 
sources to number about 380000 soldiers as part of the 
preparations for next months communist party conference 
he pressed for reform of the military units stationed in the 
allied country and championed soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
policy of perestroika or rebuilding as the appropriate 
foundation for building a better fighting force 
yazov who became head of the kremlins armed forces a year ago 
appeared to be stumping for the leaders policies among military 
officials before the party conference which is expected to be a 
faceoff between reform advocates and conservatives 
he made the address in east germany but the newspaper did not 
say when or in what city the gathering took place 
the defense minister provided no specific examples of poor 
performance by the troops serving in east germany but he delivered 
a largely critical report on their military preparedness according 
to the newspaper 
yazov blamed the substandard conditions within the military 
units on stagnant tendencies low attentiveness and 
oversimplification 
the communist party of the soviet union the soviet people 
demand of us that we liquidate these negative tendencies in the 
army which are harming military readiness yazov told the 
officers 
it was not clear how many were present for his scolding but the 
newspaper said the meeting was attended by several other generals 
and staff members of the soviet military council marshal nikolai 
v ogarkov and the soviet ambassador to east germany 
many of the party organizations of the gssg group of soviet 
soldiers in germany have yet to show themselves to be generators 
of perestroika yazov was quoted as saying 
the newspaper said he brought up problems of improving the 
quality of military preparedness and gave constructive 
recommendations for change red star did not report yazovs 
suggestions 
yazov told the meeting that part of the problem was adherence to 
the administrativecommand form of management a phrase that 
has come to refer to the leadership style of late dictator josef v 
stalin 
the gap between commanders and leaders and their subordinates 
must be narrowed and the needs concerns and interests of the 
soldiers taken into consideration in all decisionmaking the 
newspaper quoted yazov as saying 
yazov was named to succeed marshal sergei l sokolov on may 30 
1987 two days after west german teenage pilot mathias rust 
slipped past the soviet air defense forces in the baltic flew his 
singleengine plane undetered over more than 500 miles of soviet 
territory and landed in red square 
yazov became a candidate or nonvoting member of the ruling 
politburo a month later he has called for reform of the military 
services in the few articles and speeches he has given 
yazov met with his american counterpart defense secretary frank 
carlucci in switzerland in march

iraq said it launched a major ground 
offensive east of basra today to retake iraqi territory captured by 
iran 16 months ago iran said it repulsed the attack 
iraq also said its warplanes destroyed a power station in 
northern iran and tehran said a separate iraqi air raid killed 28 
civilians in northwestern iran 
the latest hostilities coincided with the opening in baghdad of 
a global popular conference on peace attended by delegates from 
dozens of countries 
staterun baghdad radio broke into regular programming to 
broadcast a military communique announcing the iraqi ground 
offensive it said iraqi forces made considerable gains in the 
operation codenamed on god we depend but it gave no casualty 
figures 
our men attacked the enemy forces to get rid of them and crush 
their heads which are empty of human values the communique said 
a later communique carried by the staterun iraqi news agency 
said iraqi forces took the southern end of fish lake a large body 
of water created by the iraqis on the border as an obstacle to 
iranian attack 
the lake was the scene of fierce fighting when iran took the 
area in january 1987 
iraqi troops including elite presidential guards also took the 
jasim river running through the area as well as two police posts 
that had been occupied by the iranians the communique said 
the attack came after warnings by iraq that it could launch a 
major offensive if iran continued to reject a settlement of the 
nearly 8yearold persian gulf war it also came the day after iraq 
warned it would retaliate for alleged iranian shelling of iraqi 
border towns 
irans islamic republic news agency said the ground attack was 
repulsed it said fighting was continuing but iranian forces held 
their ground vigilantly defending their positions 
iranian forces in january 1987 advanced on a 25milewide front 
to within six miles of the southern town of basra and have held 
much of that territory since 
the iranian agency reported an iraqi thrust in the northern 
iraqi sulaymaniyah region but said it was crushed with the 
attackers sustaining heavy losses and casualties 
iraqi air raids on the northwestern iranian border town of 
sardasht killed 28 civilians iran said iraq did not comment on 
the claim 
the iraqi news agency said warplanes flew more than 600 miles to 
bomb a power station near the caspian sea 125 miles northeast of 
tehran turning it into ashes iran said the bombs hit workers 
houses but reported no casualties 
iraqs news agency said the peace conference in baghdad was 
attended by a large number of political and social figures from 
various countries 
tehran radio said iranian prime minister hussein musavi told 
reporters that iraqi president saddam husseins aim in holding 
the socalled peace conference is only to prevent disclosure of 
facts in regard with identification of the aggressor iran has 
said it will not agree to a ceasefire unless iraq first is branded 
the aggressor in the war 
elsewhere today vernon walters the us ambassador to the 
united nations arrived in the united arab emirates for talks on 
means for achieving a ceasefire in the iraniraq war and for 
resolving the arabisraeli conflict 
walters is on a middle east tour that has taken him so far to 
israel syria jordan iraq kuwait and oman his itinerary also

the syrian reaction would be if the warning was not heeded

doctor helping palestinians in south lebanon disappeared four days

the embattled slums by extremist factions affiliated with

syria has 7500 troops 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles 
massed in hills and dunes surrounding the slums a warren of 16 
square miles of narrow alleyways and cementblock shanties

delayed a syrian push into the slums 
acting prime minister salim hoss apparently alarmed by 
hezbollahs triumph traveled to damascus today several beirut 
radio stations said he would officially request syrias military 
intervention to halt the slums war

the school board has barred its members from 
taking chauffeurdriven cars at taxpayer expense averting a 
threatened cutoff of 30 million in state money 
clara rutherford and rose mary osborne who had refused to join 
fellow board members in giving up chauffeurdriven cars to take 
them to and from evening meetings were silent in the voice vote 
tuesday night 
the decision came two weeks after state treasurer robert bowman 
said he would withhold the money from the school district which 
has a deficit of more than 60 million unless rutherford and 
osborne relented 
school officials said earlier the district would fail to meet 
its may 31 payroll without the money 
bowman said the 30 million should be available by friday 
the 11member board has been criticized for using chauffeurs 
despite financial problems the district cut 16 million from its 
budget last year and plans to eliminate 515 jobs in the fall and 
close 13 school buildings within two years 
osborne had maintained that female board members need chauffeurs 
for protection when traveling to and from evening meetings she 
also said she had poor night vision and couldnt drive safely 
a survey showed the district paid about 500000 in salaries 
overtime and bonuses to 12 drivers assigned to the board in 1986 
and the first five months of 1987 
board members receive 30 for each meeting they attend they are 
also reimbursed for expenses

beijings first beauty contest has been called 
off because such pageantry would be unsuitable when so many people 
are living in poverty organizers said today 
the cancellation came after other cities across china called off 
scheduled beauty pageants 
in beijing conditions for such an event are not ripe said 
long xinmin head of beijing television studio one of the 
scheduled sponsors he cited chinas low standard of living 
shanghai scrapped its shanghai maiden contest two weeks ago 
also saying that conditions are not ripe 
long said beijings decision was not influenced by the other 
cancellations 
the beijing contest to select 10 girls of youth and elegance 
entered the semifinals last week the 10 winners were to have been 
selected in early june 
the event open to beijing women between the ages of 17 and 27 
drew 842 applicants the field was narrowed down to 50 contestants 
after two stages 
foreign reporters were barred from attending preliminary events 
and were told they could only cover the finals they also were 
barred from chinas first beauty pageant since the 1949 communist 
victory apparently because of fears of negative publicity that 
pageant was in canton in 1985 
after beijing announced its pageant plans in april at least 
half a dozen cities also held local beauty contests 
kunming yunnan province was the first to finish selecting its 
miss spring city in early may 
but beauty contest plans in other cities met with disapproval 
from many people who said such events were improper when many 
people in china are living in poverty 
newspaper commentators in shanghai said the city was facing 
economic and other problems that require leaders and the 12 
million city residents to be of one heart and one mind and to 
quietly immerse themselves in hard work it is premature to spend 
45000 yuan 126000 on a beauty pageant 
miss empress cup of the coastal province of fujian will be 
awarded 15000 yuan or 4054 worth of prizes thats the 
equivalent of 10 years pay for the average chinese worker 
supporters of the pageants argue that the events would educate 
people on the correct standards of beauty and help raise awareness 
of grooming and manners

up more of the expenses for maintaining military defense forces of 
the alliance 
i dont think this is an area that should cause bad blood 
between us the newspaper quoted him as saying but it would be 
helpful if the allies would carry more of the load especially 
since the american congress for years has declined to approve 
further increases for defense 
reagans quotes were provided in german and translated by the 
associated press 
reagan also said it was good that gorbachevs program of 
glasnost or more openness is being practiced in other communist 
nations the newspaper reported 
referring to his relationship with gorbachev reagan was quoted 
by die welt as saying we can discuss delicate issues without 
lingering personal bad feelings i believe there is actually a 
certain degree of friendship between us

romania today denied that it sold israel 
heavy water which can be used in the production of nuclear weapons 
the norwegian foreign ministry had asked romania whether it 
reexported 12 tons of norwegian heavy water in violation of its 
sales contract a foreign ministry spokesman said today 
romanias official agerpress news agency monitored in vienna 
said the hungarian communist party daily nepszabadsag and hungarian 
radio and television in a false report had accused romania of 
selling the water to israel 
the oslo newspapers verdens gang and arbeiderbladet also said 
last week that romania may have resold the material to israel 
the romanian news agency is empowered to deny this piece of 
information and to state that never did romania sell heavy water to 
israel agerpress said 
in oslo foreign ministry spokesman lasse seim said romanias 
charge daffaires was summoned to the ministry tuesday and asked to 
convey norways query about the reported resale to the romanian 
government 
a precondition of the norwegian sale in 1986 was that the heavy 
water be used only for a planned romanian nuclear power project 
which has not yet begun 
norway sold 21 tons of heavy water directly to israel in 1959 
and is now demanding the right to inspect israeli nuclear 
facilities to ensure that the material is being used for peaceful 
purposes israel refuses all foreign inspections 
for the second time in four weeks oslo newspapers have raised 
questions about the possible diversion of norwegian heavy water 
without norways knowledge 
a government investigation confirmed an april 21 report in 
verdens gang that 15 tons of heavy water was sent to an unknown 
destination in 1983 by a west german firm 
norway requested a criminal investigation by west germany 
a duesseldorf prosecutor replied on may 5 that the international 
transport of the heavy water was not illegal under west german laws 
regulating the nuclear industry because heavy water is not 
radioactive material 
heavy water or deuterium oxide is used to cool nuclear power 
reactors by slowing the speed of neutrons released in a chain 
reaction it enables reactors to run on natural uranium instead of 
enriched uranium fuel and it may be used to produce plutonium for 
nuclear weapons 
norsk hydro norways only producer of heavy water has denied 
breaking export rules

helped pakistan launch a missile and that it agreed to share 
technology for missile production with argentina

chinese leaders agreed to supply argentina with technology for 
producing antiship and mediumrange missiles capable of hitting 
the falkland islands

it calls the malvinas 
a report in the sunday times in london said china and argentina 
signed a secret agreement during president raul alfonsins visit to 
china last week it said the agreement was for cooperation rather 
than sale of missiles and that china in return would receive access 
to argentine research stations 
li said no such agreement was discussed 
he also denied reports that china helped pakistan test fire a 
missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead 
the allegation about chinas assistance in pakistans 
launching of a mediumrange missile is utterly groundless li

with the help of chinese experts and that is capable of reaching 
the indian cities of bombay and new delhi 
li also called groundless news reports that israel helped 
develop chinese groundtoground missiles sold to saudi arabia 
on tuesday israeli defense minister yitzhak shamir also denied

the guidance systems of the chinese css2 mediumrange missile 
deployed in saudi arabia

publication janes defense weekly that china had sold mine 
sweepers to thailand and agreed to sell submarines 
china last spring sold tanks armored personel carriers and 
small arms to thailand reportedly valued at 10 million 
li also denied a report in the us media that china helped the 
united states obtain soviet weapons from afghanistan for study by 
the defense department 
china has become a major arms supplier to third world countries 
according to some estimates china is the fifth largest seller of 
arms in the world behind the soviet union united states britain 
and france 
china has been a major supplier of arms to both iran and iraq in

president reagan left today for his fourth 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev extolling 
advancements in superpower relations but pledging to go still 
farther in the interests of freedom and peace 
we have many differences deep differences moral 
differences reagan told a white house departure ceremony minutes 
before he left for the moscow summit which begins sunday and ends 
four days later 
but we are still fellow human beings we can still work 
together to keep the peace and in working with the soviet union 
the united states can still remain true to its mission of 
expanding liberty throughout the world reagan said 
several hundred people were escorted onto the south lawn of the 
white house to witness reagans departure remarks under a steady 
rain reagan spoke as an aide held a black umbrella over him first 
lady nancy reagan stood next to the president sheltered from the 
rain by an umbrella held by a second aide 
but the umbrella failed to keep the president dry his wife was 
overheard remarking to reagan honey youre just soaked 
he answered i know it she then asked why didnt you put 
on a raincoat his answer was not overheard 
a military band had played patriotic marches as the reagans 
emerged from the diplomatic entrance among those in the large 
crowd standing by were several members of the cabinet and soviet 
ambassador yuri dubynin 
as the brief ceremony ended the navys blue angels precison 
flight team staged a lowaltitude flyby 
before leaving for a stopover in helsinki finland the 
president asked for the prayers of americans as i embark on this 
great task 
since my first meeting with mr gorbachev we have come a 
long way reagan said my task in the next week will be to go 
still farther farther in the interests of peace farther toward a 
universal respect for fundamental human rights farther toward 
world freedom farther toward a safer world for all people 
reagan said 
reagan was leaving without a ratified ussoviet treaty banning 
mediumrange nuclear missiles the highlight of his last summit in 
december with gorbachev 
the pact is still awaiting senate approval and white house chief 
of staff howard baker is staying behind in the hope the senate may 
act and the treaty can be rushed to reagan before he meets with 
gorbachev 
several of reagans own conservative colleagues have stalled 
action on the pact arguing it is onesided and does not address 
concerns about potential soviet cheating 
but senate leaders moved tuesday to halt debate 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said senate majority 
leader robert byrd dwva told reagan on tuesday that in all 
likelihood the senate will be able to act on the treaty by 
friday 
the president summing up his fourpart agenda for the may 
29june 2 talks with the soviet general secretary noted in his 
departure remarks that he and gorbachev have plenty of work to 
do 
i do not expect it to be easy reagan said 
on arms control reagan lauded the pact banning mediumrange 
missiles for reducing the level of superpower arsenals for the 
first time progress has been made on a second pact to slash 
strategic weapons by half he said adding that he intended to 
resolve the issues that still stand in the way 
secretary of state george p shultz held out the hope tuesday 
that the strategic arms treaty can be completed before reagan 
leaves office in january 
on human rights reagan lauded soviet advancements such as the 
loosening of emigration restraints and the release of political 
prisoners reagan said he intended to see that the positive 
trends continue and the reforms are made permanent 
on regional issues reagan noted that the two countries have 
signed the geneva accords outlining the withdrawal of soviet troops 
from afghanistan and that the first withdrawals have begun but he 
said he would be looking for soviet actions to help advance 
negotiations on problems in angola and namibia and to support 
un efforts to end the iraniraq war 
on bilateral ties reagan pledged to extend the areas of 
cooperation this will include everything from practical matters 
of nuclear safety to radio navigation and the protection of the 
global environment he said 
reagan said his goal throughout his meetings with gorbachev 
which began in geneva in 1985 has been to establish a better 
working relationship with the soviet union one no longer subject 
to the dangerous highs and lows of the past a working relationship 
based on realities not merely on a seeming relaxation of tensions 
 
in my talks with general secretary gorbachev next week we 
will be looking to the future for there remains much to be done 
reagan said 
reagan and gorbachev are expected to sign some minor agreements 
on cultural programs fishing civilian nuclear reactor safety 
transportation technologies and a packet of understandings on coast 
guardmaritime issues according to assistant secretary of state 
rozanne ridgway 
the visit marks the first time the 77yearold reagan sets foot 
in the nation he once derided as the evil empire it also is 
the first time in 14 years an american commanderinchief has 
visited moscow the last trip was made by thenpresident nixon in 
june 1974 
reagan is scheduled to arrive in helsinki in the predawn hours 
of thursday he will remain there until sunday morning when he 
boards air force one for the 1hour trip to moscow 
almost immediately after his arrival reagan and gorbachev are 
scheduled to begin their fourth summit in 30 months 
shultz said tuesday that the united states will make new 
proposals at the summit to help solve the problem of keeping track 
of mobile missiles one of the key obstacles to a new ussoviet 
treaty on strategic weapons 
the secretary said the administration would also pursue a system 
for sending observers to suspect sites with little advance warning 
in a speech broadcast in europe on tuesday reagan said he does 
not expect to achieve a quick radical transformation of the 
soviet system 
there still remain profound political and moral differences 
between the soviet system and our own 
the president said he hopes to reach an agreement on strategic 
nuclear weapons this year though it is the requirements of a 
good treaty and not some arbitrary deadline that will determine the 
timetable 
the presidents remarks were broadcast overseas on the us 
information agencys worldnet satellite service the speech was 
taped monday in the oval office

the reagan administration discussed a plan in 
1985 to send agents to france to abduct the reputed ringleader of 
the group holding american hostages in the middle east but 
rejected the proposal out of fear it would anger the french 
government a us official said today 
american intelligence had received word that imad mugniyeh a 
lebanese shiite linked to terrorist attacks was visiting france 
and some members of the administration advocated seizing mugniyeh 
and bringing him to the united states for trial said the official 
the state department fearing an abduction would cause a major 
blowup in usfrench relations shot down the proposal said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
instead french officials were asked to arrest mugniyeh but 
they did not act on the request said the official 
national public radio which first reported the proposal said 
in a report broadcast today that the plan was conceived by william 
casey then director of central intelligence 
npr reported that it was never completely proven that mugniyeh 
was in france at the time his abduction was proposed in early 
1986 following new reports of mugniyehs presence in france local 
authorities did act on the us request and went to a hotel to 
arrest him 
instead of finding a lebanese terrorist police found a family 
of vacationers npr reported 
mugniyeh has been identified by us terrorism experts as the 
leader of islamic jihad an iranianbacked group held responsible 
for the kidnapping of nine americans and other westerners in 
lebanon 
he is under indictment in the united states on charges of 
participating in the june 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner and the 
killing of navy diver robert stethem one of the passengers 
the us official who spoke of the proposal to abduct mugniyeh 
said theres always a lot of brainstorming about this sort of 
thing it was an idea that was floated people were saying how can 
we do this 
it didnt get to the top level he said 
the state department felt strongly that if something like this 
was to be done it could not be through secret connivance there had 
to be a decision by french political authorities to arrest him and 
turn him over to the united states he said

for almost four months an elderly widow was kept 
doped up and barred from contact with the outside world by a 
couple authorities say bilked her out of more than 100000 in 
savings 
one day however lucille knight managed to slip a note to 
relatives 500 miles away in hammond la and a sheriffs deputy 
eventually rescued her from the ringgold ga house that was her 
prison 
mrs knight went back to the hammond trailer where she was 
kidnapped and waited for word that her tormenters had been caught 
now almost two years later a georgia couple has been charged with 
federal fraud kidnapping and conspiracy 
terry lee barrett 29 and alice virginia barrett 31 were 
indicted may 10 by a federal grand jury in atlanta us attorney 
robert barr said tuesday they surrendered friday in tickfaw la 
and are being held on 100000 bond 
they destroyed everything i had the 83yearold mrs knight 
said tuesday in a telephone interview from her hammond home they 
kept me doped up most all the time i was there i couldnt stand 
up i couldnt walk i couldnt do anything 
the widows ordeal began feb 3 1986 when a couple she barely 
knew came to her trailer park home in hammond she says she woke up 
three days later in ringgold 
mrs knight said she had met mrs barrett only once on a visit 
the previous christmas to ringgold where mrs barrett had cared 
for mrs knights brother everett joiner for several years 
larry black then captain of detectives for the catoosa county 
sheriffs department said tuesday that mrs knights neighbors 
remembered seeing her carried from her mobile home but friends or 
relatives who would call to check on her were told she was sick or 
at the doctors 
louisiana authorities apparently were reluctant to pursue the 
case believing it was a domestic dispute rather than a kidnapping 
black said 
mrs knight said that one day she finally managed to get her 
brother to mail a letter to her niece barbara wittie in louisiana 
he took it out to the end of the driveway waited for the 
mailman bought a stamp from him and got him to mail it mrs 
knight said 
the letter brought her niece to black who said he went to the 
house on june 5 found mrs knight and told her that her 
relatives were here and asked her if she was ok 
eventually he said he took her to his patrol car because she 
was obviously in ill health and frightened he later notified the 
fbi 
black said he returned to the house a week later and the 
barretts had left he believes they traveled to st louis virginia 
and back to louisiana 
the indictment claims the barretts stole 10187572 in all 
depositing the money in a chattanooga tenn bank in the name of 
barrett bakery and barretts cajun bakery and deli 
it alleges they forged mrs knights signature on social 
security and retirement checks from california and gained access 
to her savings accounts using the money for their own purposes 
the barretts administered valium quaaludes percodan and 
laxatives to keep mrs knight under control according to the 
indictment 
i didnt know they had taken everything i had until black 
rescued her mrs knight said she has been living in hammond ever 
since and said she has suffered no lingering effects from the 
drugs 
at the time of the rescue black said he asked joiner if he 
wanted to leave but he refused joiner has since died and is not 
mentioned in the indictment 
mrs knights niece said that joiner had given mrs barrett his 
power of attorney and may also have been under the influence of the 
couple the constitution reported today 
if convicted the barretts could be sentenced to life in prison 
and fined 2 million barr said they will be arraigned in rome 
ga in a few days

vice president george bush today accused 
a liberal elite of seeking to undermine us defense and said 
that while he was encouraged by the upcoming superpower summit 
we cannot wish away the soviet union as a competitor 
the republican presidential contender addressing a graduation 
ceremony at the us military academy said the times require 
leadership that will pursue negotiations with the soviet 
realistically 
standing in a pouring rain during the outdoor ceremony bush 
told the graduating cadets that summits such as the one in moscow 
beginning this weekend are good in and of themselves for they 
contribute to an atmosphere of peace and familiarity 
however bush said americans must not become too complacent 
about a soviet threat just because the two sides are talking 
in what was billed by his aides as a nonpolitical speech bush 
lashed out at liberals 
however he praised the late president john f kennedy for 
standing firm against the soviets in cuba saying that kennedys 
acts were in line with a bipartisan consensus on dealing with the 
soviets that had prevailed from the 1940s 
but by the 70s the consensus had fractured splintered the 
center did not hold bush said 
the liberal elite do not understand they never understood 
the common sense behind the former approach to the soviets bush 
told the graduating cadets 
they are so blinded by ideology that they cannot see what 
americans have understood for 40 years that peace flows from 
strength he said 
bush said that such people whom he did not identify will 
make the world more dangerous 
the vice president addressed the graduating class of 849 men and 
90 women 
bush was campaigning later today in new jersey then was heading 
to his oceanfront vacation home in kennebunkport maine while 
reagan is in moscow bush is to spend the next week meeting with 
advisers and republican leaders with an eye to sharpening his 
strategy for the fall campaign 
republican advisers in recent days mindful of recent polls 
showing bush trailing democratic frontrunner michael dukakis have 
urged the candidate to come up with more specifics on campaign 
issues that will help to separate him from the administrations 
recent problems 
his aides are portraying the maine visit as lowprofile and say 
they expect the vice president to do more listening than newsmaking 
while the public spotlight is on the moscow summit 
during the time in kennebunkport bush will be meeting with 
republican governors senators congressmen people with 
expertise in economic and domestic affairs said campaign 
spokesman peter teeley 
basically hell be discussing issues and looking at these 
issues in relation to the general election 
despite his continued efforts to identify himself with 
accomplishments of the reagan administration bush in recent weeks 
has staked out his own stands apart from reagans on issues ranging 
from education to day care and the environment 
he has also put some distance between himself and the 
administrations efforts to strike a deal with panamanian military 
leader manuel antonio noriega including the possibility of 
dropping drug charges in exchange for his relinquishing of power 
bush has said that if elected he would not negotiate with drug 
traffickers and aides said bush privately has urged that talks 
with noriega be broken off 
on tuesday house republicans met for 90 minutes with top bush 
campaign officials participants said bush was applauded at the 
meeting for differing with reagan on noriega 
its a very symbolic circumstance where bush has moved from 
being vice president to being his own candidate said rep jim 
leach of iowa 
almost to a person they were pleased about the separation on 
noriega said rep lynn martin of illinois 
bushs poor showing in recent polls showing he was behind 
dukakis in a hypothetical fall matchup by margins ranging from 7 to 
16 percentage points was also discussed at the session according 
to participants 
we have bad polls if this were october wed be suicidal but 
its may martin said but she added there wasnt anybody up 
screaming my god weve got the titanic the seas are rough 
the republican lawmakers met with lee atwater the bush campaign 
manager craig fuller the vice presidents chief of staff and 
pollster robert teeter 
teeter shrugged off the recent polls and said he told the house 
members were in a very artificial period that period when 
dukakis has been rolling along what you got to do is get past this 
california primary before people begin to focus on it the 
presidential race 
california and new jersey both hold primaries on june 7 
after speaking in west point bush was to speak to a group of 
senior citizens in lakewood nj and attend a gop rally in jersey 
city 
on thursday he planned several campaign stops in the newark 
area before heading to maine

a flight mechanic without a pilots license stole 
a private jet in virginia early today and took it on a 1600mile 
joyride to denver where he shot himself as authorities closed in 
officials said 
the indication was that he just wanted to fly around for a 
while said richard boulware spokesman for stapleton 
international airport 
denver police fbi agents and emergency vehicles were waiting at 
the edge of a runway at the airport when the twinengine learjet 36 
came to a stop in a landing an airport spokesman said appeared to 
be that of a proficient pilot 
as the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached he 
was ordered to lock his brakes said boulware they heard a 
noise and when they looked in the cockpit they found him dead 
things happened really fast 
the man mike christiansen 24 of newport news va was alone 
in the jet stolen from his employer flight international at 
patrick henry international airport in newport news where the 
plane sideswiped a security van as it took off said airport 
spokesman pete daikos 
were not sure whether he had a gun when he started but when 
he landed he was surrounded and he shot himself shot and killed 
himself said dick stafford a federal aviation administration 
spokesman in washington 
daikos said at a news conference in newport news that 
christiansen had been a flight mechanic at flight international 
since march he said christiansen did not have a pilots license 
this is bizarre boulware said rarely do you find someone 
stealing a plane like this worth millions of dollars 
this guy obviously was a proficient pilot he said he 
made a good landing right in the middle of the runway with no 
damage to the plane or the runway 
daikos said the man is believed to be a former resident of the 
denver area no one saw him armed he said 
atlantabased flight international performs ground services for 
corporate aircraft and airlines and operates the worlds largest 
fleet of learjets daikos said 
daikos said flight international also is a major contractor 
with the armed forces to test defense mechanisms by challenging 
them he said some of the learjets have classified electronic 
gear but the stolen plane was not believed to be so equipped 
gordon james executive vice president of flight international 
confirmed that the man was an employee but refused further comment 
john hill of the peninsula airport commission security staff 
which oversees the newport news airport reported receiving a call 
about 215 am from a guard who told him an aircraft was being 
stolen daikos said 
hill drove onto the runway in a van and got out daikos said 
the airplane apparently hit the van damaging the drivers side and 
leaving what appeared to be part of a wingtip fuel tank on the 
runway daikos said no one was injured 
air traffic controllers at several airports had tracked the 
plane for parts of the flight across the country stafford said 
controllers in longmont picked up the plane over colorado springs 
south of denver according to boulware 
the jet landed at 518 am 
we got an experienced lear 36 pilot up in the stapleton 
control tower and he managed to talk him down into a good 
landing boulware said 
according to janes all the worlds aircraft the learjet has a 
flight range of about 1640 miles when carrying four passengers and 
a full load of fuel 
flight experts here said the learjet 36 is designed to seat two 
crew members and 11 passengers although boulware said this plane 
could seat six or seven passengers 
boulware said the plane was picked up at 39000 feet he said 
the learjet cruises at about 500 mph

vice president george bush today accused a liberal elite of 
chipping away at a national consensus that the united states must 
deal from strength in approaching the soviet union democratic 
presidential frontrunner michael dukakis reaped endorsements on 
capitol hill before flying west for a debate with jesse jackson 
bush the allbutcertain republican nominee used the 
graduation ceremony at west point to say that the 1980s require 
leadership that will pursue negotiations with the soviet 
realistically 
speaking as president reagan was leaving for the moscow summit 
bush said such superpower meetings are good in and of themselves 
for they contribute to an atmosphere of peace and familiarity 
however he added we cannot wish away the soviet union as a 
competitor 
without naming names he said the liberal elite do not 
understand they never understood the common sense behind what 
he said was a former consensus on dealing with the soviet union 
they are so blinded by ideology that they cannot see what 
americans have understood for 40 years that peace flows from 
strength he told the graduating cadets 
one day earlier bush picked up what could prove to be an 
unwelcome piece of baggage on the campaign trail reagans veto of 
a big trade bill 
dukakis who has frequently criticized the expected veto said 
today at the capitol that it was a tragedy for reagan to take 
such action because of a provision requiring companies to give 60 
days notice to workers before closing a plant 
on a happier note for bush the republican nomineetobe cruised 
to an easy victory in idahos presidential primary on tuesday he 
was picking up 15 of the 18 national convention delegates as 
dukakis won a nonbinding democratic beauty contest with no 
delegates at stake 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting dukakis was taking 
73 percent to jacksons 16 percent in idaho while bush was gaining 
82 percent to 9 percent for pat robertson who suspended his 
presidential bid earlier this month 
robertson was winning one delegate with two going to the 
uncommitted column bush already has more delegates than he needs 
for the gop nomination 
in washington dukakis picked up endorsements from more than a 
dozen members of congress and met privately with former rival 
albert gore jr 
dukakis talk with gore resulted in no endorsement but it was 
a good friendly meeting dukakis spokesman mark gearan said of 
the session he said the two men met alone in dukakis hotel room 
bush left washington to spend a week at his summer home in 
kennebunkport maine after speaking to the graduating cadets at 
west point he was expected to keep a low profile to avoid 
upstaging reagan during the moscow summit 
tonights jacksondukakis debate in san francisco comes as the 
two campaign for californias june 7 primary candidates debates 
were almost painfully commonplace earlier in the campaign as the 
thecrowded democratic field met frequently for talkfests 
but the last time jackson and dukakis met for a debate was in 
april prior to the pennsylvania primary back then the two were 
exchanging mainly pleasantries but jackson has been more critical 
of dukakis in recent weeks as the delegate gap between the two 
widened 
dukakis is now within striking distance of the 2081 delegates 
needed to nominate he has 1680 to jacksons 983 according to the 
latest associated press count 
on tuesday dukakis denounced reagans veto of the trade 
measure which would require advance notice of plant closings 
any administration that is willing to give gen manuel 
antonio noriega 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be 
willing to give the american worker 60 days notice before they are 
thrown out on the street the massachusetts governor said 
referring to talks aimed at easing the panamanian military leader 
from power noriega is under indictment on drug charges 
dukakis made it clear the plantclosing issue would be used as 
ammunition in his expected campaign against the vice president 
reagan and bush he said dont understand that for working 
families there is nothing more painful than losing a job 
even some bush backers broke with the administration on the 
trade bill rep guy molinari bushs new york campaign chairman 
was one of 60 house republicans who joined in the 308113 vote to 
override the veto senate democratic leaders have said they expect 
the veto to stand in their chamber 
bush has not come out directly in favor of the presidents 
position but he hasnt publicly dissented either 
he has edged slightly away from reagan by speaking favorably of 
the plantclosing law in massachusetts dukakis home state but 
bush has said that he approves of the massachusetts measure because 
it is voluntary whereas the federal one would be mandatory 
for the vice president the trade bill was the latest example of 
an administration action that has left him on the defensive as he 
campaigns in one such controversy the noriega affair bush let 
it be known if in cautious terms that he disagreed with the 
president 
on tuesday at an antiapartheid rally in los angeles jackson 
renewed his call for south africa to be designated a terrorist 
state and said he would push to include that in the party platform 
jackson also released a fiveyear budget plan this week calling 
for a freeze in military spending he underscored that idea on 
tuesday in a speech before a world affairs council luncheon in los 
angeles and said that he hoped it would also be reflected in the 
platform 
after the largest military buildup in our history we must 
change our course or lose our way he told the group

israelibacked lebanese militiamen 
today attacked three southern strongholds of proiranian guerrillas 
after israeli jets helicopters and artillery fired on the villages 
a police spokesman said about 750 militiamen from the 
israeliallied south lebanon army advanced toward the villages of 
soujud lowaizeh and mleekh behind fierce shelling and air cover 
the three villages a few miles north of this market town just 
outside israels selfproclaimed security zone are traditional 
strongholds of the shiite moslem extremist hezbollah or party of 
god 
most of the villages civilian populations had left after 
hezbollah started using them as bases for attacks against the south 
lebanon army 
israeli helicopter gunships and jet fighters carried out at 
least nine attacks against the three villages and surrounding hills 
before the tankled south lebanon army forces began a twopronged 
attack around dawn the police spokesman said 
the spokesman who by regulation cannot be identified said 
south lebanon army forces stormed through hezbollah lines in the 
villages of lowaizeh and mleekh and were advancing toward soujud 
south lebanon army fighters in sovietdesigned t54 tanks 
overran lowaizeh and are currently fighting hezbollahs pockets 
of resistance in mleekh he added 
another south lebanon army force advancing behind a barrage of 
israeli howitzer fire was engaged with hezbollah fighters at the 
southern entrance to soujud the spokesman said 
soujud is five miles north of nabatiyeh and lowaizeh is another 
five miles northeast of soujud mleekh is midway between the two 
villages 
the three villages are just one mile west of an south lebanon 
armyheld mountainous road connecting the town of marjayoun in 
israels security zone with the christian town of jezzine 
security sources in south lebanon said the south lebanon army 
attack came hours after israel massed a mechanized force of about 
600 troops in mountainous areas overlooking the battleground 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said the israeli 
forces crossed into the security zone late tuesday and drove to 
the hill of ali taher and the village of aishiyeh across 
marjayoun 
ali taher and aishiyeh are along the south lebanon 
armycontrolled stretch of terrain connecting the security zone 
with jezzine 
in jerusalem today israels armed forces chief of staff said 
there was a danger of escalating clashes between israel and the 
hezbollah militia in south lebanon 
there is no doubt that when we attack hezbollah there is a 
danger some threat of escalation but we attack only those who 
threaten us directly and in this case hezbollah does provide a 
direct threat said lt gen dan shomron 
he said hezbollah guerrillas had used bases just north of the 
security zone to launch attacks against israels northern border 
and its forces in the zone 
however israeli forces had limited their role to supporting the 
south lebanon army in todays fighting he said 
israel has maintained the 6to10miledeep security zone since 
the summer of 1985 after withdrawing the bulk of its occupation 
army from southern lebanon the south lebanon armypoliced border 
strip serves as a buffer against guerrilla attacks into northern 
israel 
hezbollah said its fighters were confronting the attack on 
the three villages and the police spokesman said the attacking 
south lebanon army force was facing stiff resistance from 
hezbollah fighters in valleys around mleekh and soujud 
hezbollah had earlier ordered its fighters to spread in the 
valleys in an apparent effort to avoid suffering heavy casualties 
tankled israeli troops stormed through hezbollah lines in the 
bekaa valleys village of maydoun on may 4 israel said 40 
hezbollah fighters and three israeli soldiers were killed in the 
confrontation 
israel has launched nine previous air attacks into lebanon this 
year that killed 49 people and wounded 75 by police count

former philippines president ferdinand marcos 
was hospitalized in intensive care because of chest pains 
officials said 
marcos 70 was listed in guarded condition tuesday night at st 
francis medical center and was undergoing tests said eugene n 
tiwanak the hospitals assistant administrator 
he began suffering chest pains during the day after an 
hourlong interview with allen neuharth chairman of the gannett 
newspaper group marcos continued to feel the pains the family 
consulted with marcos personal physician and it was decided he 
should be taken to the hosital for a checkup said arturo aruiza 
marcos chief spokesman 
marcos was taken to the hospital by car at about 8 pm tuesday 
said aruiza 
there were unconfirmed reports monday that marcos health was 
deteriorating but his spokesman gemmo trinidad said at the time 
marcos was healthy although still grieving the death of his mother 
hes admitted that hes feeling ill that he is not well 
aruiza said at the hospital 
also at the hospital was marcos wife imelda who was wearing 
her customary black dress and sunglasses 
mrs marcos left the hospital through a side door and appeared 
to be escorted by four people she told them thank you so much 
for coming 
asked if marcos was going to be all right she replied yes i 
think so i hope so 
in the philippines sen juan ponce enrile a former defense 
minister under marcos and sen ernesto maceda who ran on mrs 
aquinos ticket but has since grown critical of her administration 
said marcos should be allowed to return home 
this is going to create another problem if marcos comes home 
in a box maceda said today now is the time for the government 
to act and allow him to return 
marcos was hospitalized briefly at st francis last october 
during which a parathyroid gland was removed to ease chronic pain 
in his legs doctors said 
marcos his wife and their three children have lived here since 
fleeing the philippines during the february 1986 civilianmilitary 
revolution toppled him after 20 years in power 
marcos who was first elected president in 1965 ruled the 
philippines with a mixture of dictatorship and democracy reform 
and stagnation 
he was reelected in 1969 in 1972 he declared martial law as 
troops arrested scores of opponents saying it was needed to save 
the country from communism and to reform society marcos ruled with 
an iron hand for the next eight years 
he lifted martial law in january 1981 but gave up little of his 
vast powers a few weeks later he won another term against a 
little known candidate in an election that was boycotted by all his 
major opponents 
the beginning of the end for marcos reign came in 1983 when 
his most powerful challenger benigno aquino was assassinated on 
his return from exile in the united states opposition to marcos 
grew rapidly and he scheduled an early election in february 1986 
to prove his popularity 
the commission on elections said marcos won but opponent 
corazon aquino aquinos widow charged the election was rigged and 
also claimed victory 
later that month defense minister juan ponce enrile broke with 
marcos soldiers joined by hundreds of thousands of civilians 
rose up against marcos sweeping mrs aquino to the presidency 
marcos 95yearold mother josefa edralinmarcos died in the 
philippines on may 4 the family appealed to mrs aquino to allow 
marcos to return for funeral but she refused citing national 
security 
the body has been lying in state at a suburban manila church 
where scores of marcos supporters have been conducting a vigil 
marked by calls for his return

washington lawyer william a borders refused 
to testify today at house impeachment proceedings against federal 
judge alcee l hastings and deprived investigators of eagerly 
sought testimony by a crucial figure in an alleged bribery scheme 
borders flanked by two lawyers cited fifth amendment 
guarantees against selfincrimination in refusing to answer any 
questions by the house judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice 
which is studying impeachment charges against hastings 
borders noted only that he was convicted in 1982 of arranging a 
150000 bribe for hastings from two miami racketeers was 
sentenced to five years in prison and fined 35000 
he served 33 months in the allenwood pa federal prison and 27 
months on parole and was subsequently disbarred by the district of 
columbia court of appeals 
i believe that my legal debt to society expired on may 22 
1988 after my release from parole borders said i 
respectfully refuse to answer any and all questions based on my 
rights under the united states constitution 
rep john conyers jr dmich the subcommittee chairman said 
his panel would decidelater the very difficult question of 
whether to grant borders immunity from prosecution and compel his 
testimony 
hastings was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring with borders who 
is a close friend to solicit a bribe from the two convicted 
racketeers frank and tom romano in exchange for a promise of 
lenient sentences and return of a major portion of seized assets 
borders refused to testify at both his own and hastings trials 
he also refused to testify before a fivejudge investigative panel 
of the 11th us circuit court of appeals that was appointed 
shortly after hastings was acquitted 
the judicial panel concluded there was clear and convincing 
evidence that hastings actually took part in a bribery scheme and 
then attempted a coverup by lying under oath and manufacturing 
evidence at his trial 
the panels findings were endorsed unanimously by the judicial 
conference of the united states the chief policymaking body of 
the federal judiciary and forwarded to house leaders in march 1987 
with the advice that consideration of impeachment may be 
warranted 
hastings who continues to sit on the bench for the us 
district court in miami insists he knew nothing of the bribery 
scheme and accuses borders of using his name to shake down the 
romano brothers 
the house impeachment panel heard testimony on tuesday from 
linguistics expert roger w shuy who said a critical telephone 
conversation between hastings and borders on oct 5 1981 was 
spoken in code possibly in an attempt to disguise details of a 
bribery plot 
the phone call from hastings in miami to borders in washington 
was secretly recorded by the fbi one of its undercover agents 
posing as frank romano already had delivered a 25000 bribery 
down payment to borders 
hastings says the 29second conversation concerned some letters 
he had drafted to help another friend hemphill pride of columbia 
sc regain his lawyers credentials after serving a prison term 
for misappropriation of housing funds 
shuy chairman of the linguistics department at georgetown 
university in washington said the recording indicates that 
borders and hastings were using a code to convey information that 
was not obvious to outsiders both in their words and the 
structure of the dialogue 
shuy refused to speculate what hastings and borders were really 
discussing but under questioning by house staff lawyers he said 
it was possible they were talking about bribe payments and concern 
over whether hastings should order the return of forfeited assets 
seized from the romanos

the estate of hallmark cards founder 
owes the government more than 200 million in taxes the internal 
revenue service says 
if the irs prevails in the case being heard this week in us 
tax court the 1315 million estate left by joyce c hall could 
become bankrupt 
hall died in 1982 and had earmarked his fortune for kansas city 
charities 
the irs contends that halls main asset stock in hallmark was 
sold by the estate at far below its market value the irs says an 
accurate valuation is needed to establish the correct estate taxes 
so the government gets its proper share 
halls estate contends that the stock really has no market value 
because the kansas city greeting card maker is privately owned 
instead the stock was sold for a price determined by an oftenused 
formula based on the adjusted book value of the stock 
the estate is confident of its legal position hallmark 
spokesman charles w hucker said

the chief senate opponent of the superpower 
mediumrange nuclear missile treaty said today im licked in 
efforts to amend the agreement apparently clearing the way for 
approval before president reagan begins his moscow summit meeting 
im licked in terms of doing anything on the treaty said 
sen jesse helms rnc as he sat down at a meeting with senate 
leaders to work out a procedural tangle that has stalled action on 
the treaty for more than a week 
the move raised hopes among treaty supporters that the pact 
could be approved for ratification as soon as friday and forwarded 
to reagan by the time the summit begins on sunday to give him a 
stronger position in the talks with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva and his republican 
counterpart sen bob dole of kansas had filed petitions tuesday 
to limit debate and force it to a vote in time for the summit 
im fairly confident we will be able to finish the treaty 
friday or saturday byrd said but he noted that potential 
problems still exist including competing items on the senates 
legislative agenda such as attempting to override president 
reagans veto of a trade bill 
reagan left washington today for the summit with a threeday 
stopover in helsinki finland en route 
the president was looking ahead to the next armscontrol treaty 
one he hopes will call for massive reductions in us and soviet 
arsenals of intercontinental nuclear missiles he said he hoped 
such a pact could be reached before his term expires in january 
it is the requirements of a good treaty and not some 
arbitrary deadline that will determine the timetable reagan 
said in remarks broadcast on the governments worldnet 
satellite service 
the treaty which requires elimination within three years of all 
us and soviet nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3400 
miles requires 67 votes for senate approval estimates of senate 
support for the measure range from 87 to 95 votes so its ultimate 
outcome is not in question 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty as it is known 
would result in the elimination of 867 us missiles in europe and 
elimination of 1752 soviet missiles 
but helms and a few other conservatives have sought to delay the 
measure raising questions about the validity of intelligence data 
on the numbers of some soviet missiles and the crafting of the 
treaty language they have offered a series of amendments since the 
treaty was brought up last week all of which have been defeated by 
overwhelming margins 
both sides fouled up on this treaty helms said during 
tuesdays debate my conscience will not allow me not to pursue 
the obvious defects 
but byrd and dole filed motions tuesday to limit the debate and 
a vote on that matter was scheduled for sometime thursday it was 
considered virtually certain to win the 60 votes needed to cut off 
debate and that would set up a vote on final approval of the 
treaty for sometime friday 
sen dale bumpers dark a treaty supporter said he believed 
opponents were not attacking the intermediaterange missile treaty 
but were instead trying to sow doubt about a future treaty cutting 
longrange missile arsenals 
it seems to me like nuclear idolatry bumpers said the 
ideologues will never never go gently into that night 
byrd said he was confident democrats would still be able to 
bring up and debate the one amendment adopted during committee 
consideration of the treaty one that would force the president to 
get senate approval for any later change in interpretation of the 
treaty 
the amendment is an attempt to assert the senates 
constitutional right of advise and consent on the presidents 
treatymaking power and stems from a dispute over reagan 
administration reinterpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty with the soviets 
byrd said today he had prepared a possible compromise on the 
amendment which was put forward by sen joseph biden ddel but 
declined to discuss it

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis pocketed endorsements today from more than a dozen members 
of congress and met privately with vanquished rival albert gore jr 
as he methodically made the rounds of the capitol 
the massachusetts governor also renewed his criticism of 
president reagans veto of trade legislation he said it was a 
tragedy to veto the measure over a provision requiring companies 
to give 60 days notice to workers before closing a plant 
in addition during a meeting with western lawmakers dukakis 
criticized the administrations environmental policies saying 
offshore oil drilling should be a last resort not a first 
though republican vice president george bush is considered 
strong in the west dukakis told the lawmakers he would run an 
aggressive campaign in their states he said the issues that are 
important to voters nationwide are the same ones that concern 
western voters including jobs education economic opportunity a 
clean and safe america and a strong america 
dukakis private talk with gore resulted in no endorsement and 
aides said in advance none was expected it was a good friendly 
meeting dukakis spokesman mark gearan said of the session he 
said the two men met in dukakis hotel room without aides 
the massachusetts governor also was receiving the formal 
endorsement of several members of the house and senate and the 
views of several dozen others in a fastpaced series of meetings 
dukakis spent his morning in washington before a scheduled flight 
to california and an evening debate with jesse jackson in advance 
of the states june 7 primary 
dukakis is the democratic nominee in all but name and his 
morning schedule was designed to depict him as the leader of a 
united party he moved from meeting to meeting with lawmakers who 
will share the democratic ticket with him in the fall 
the dukakis campaign said those endorsing the governor included 
sens john breaux of louisiana dale bumpers of arkansas quentin 
burdick of north dakota wendell ford of kentucky harry reid of 
nevada and dennis deconcini of arizona 
among house members reps frank annunzio of illinois john 
bryant of texas norman dicks of washington william ford of 
michigan tony hall of ohio paul kanjorski of pennsylvania tom 
lantos leon panetta nancy pelosi pete stark tony beilenson vic 
fazio and esteban torres of california peter rodino of new jersey 
james scheuer of new york richard stallings of idaho ron wyden of 
oregon 
dukakis campaign made sure that the governors meetings with 
those lawmakers as well as groups of southern and western 
congressmen were well covered by reporters 
in contrast the session with gore was held in unusual privacy 
the meeting did not appear on dukakis printed schedule and the 
senator walked alone into the washington hotel where dukakis was 
staying and was ushered into his room 
the tennessee senator has more than 350 delegates to the 
democratic national convention in his column and has urged his 
supporters to stay loyal but dukakis has slowly been whittling 
away at gores delegate strength 
 
 
the massachusetts governor has 1680 delegates out of 2081 
needed to win the nomination aides say they have no doubt that 
dukakis will emerge from the final day of the primary season with a 
nominating majority in hand 
these campaign officials say they expect dukakis will earn 
roughly 300 of the 456 delegates at stake june 7 in the years 
final democratic primaries in california new jersey montana and 
new mexico 
that would mean they need to find another 100 to 150 from the 
ranks of the uncommitted or from candidate dropouts like gore to 
reach the total needed to clinch the nomination 
dukakis spent tuesday night in washington after an evening 
fundraiser in virginia 
the massachusetts governor set out on his campaign swing after 
spending most of tuesday in boston where he issued a statement 
that managed to link president reagans veto of the trade bill with 
the administrations protracted negotiations with panamanian leader 
manuel antonio noriega indicted on drug charges 
any administration that is willing to give general noriega 120 
days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the 
american worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the 
street the statement said reagan vetoed the trade bill citing 
objections over a provision requiring employers to give workers 
advance warning on plant closings 
in his statement dukakis tied his probable republican opponent 
in the fall vice president george bush to the veto saying that 
neither the president nor the vice president understands that for 
working families who struggle to pay the mortgage save for their 
childrens education and care for their elders there is nothing 
more painful than losing a job 
i think the president is making a very serious mistake the 
governor told reporters this is a good trade bill its a 
responsible bill to veto this bill because it will give 
working people and their families 60 days notice beore theyre laid 
off seems to be to be unconscionable he said

david letterman said today in a statement 
released by nbc that his manager and attorney are negotiating with 
the writers guild of america to get his late night show back on 
the air possibly as early as june 8 
the writers guild has been on strike against television and 
motion picture producers since march 7 negotiations broke off soon 
after the strike started but resumed this week with a federal 
negotiator and a session is scheduled for today no details of the 
negotiations have been released 
only the smothers brothers comedy hour and one independent 
movie producer have received waivers from the guild to continue 
production during the strike 
johnny carson whose tonight show like late night has 
been in reruns since the strike began went back on the air last 
week writing his own material carson is not a member of the 
writers guild but letterman is 
mona mangan executive director of the writers guild of america 
east said if the union membership agreed in its meeting on 
thursday the letterman show could receive a waiver

contracts which if the members agree at the meetings on thursday 
will be available to david letterman as well we do not wish to 
comment further on the substance of our conversations between our 
lawyers and the david letterman people she said

during the last two weeks my manager jack rollins my 
attorney ron elberger and us attorney general ed meese have been 
working with the writers guild of america and nbc in an attempt to 
resume production of late night the signs seem most encouraging 
that we could return to the air accompanied by our entire writing 
staff as early as june 8 1988 
in the meantime i am keeping busy with my gardening and 
phoning my favorite talkradio programs last month i splurged and 
treated myself to muchneeded liposuction surgery on my hips and 
thighs i look and feel 10 years younger

usbacked rebels have accepted 
managua as the site for a new round of peace talks with the 
government a rebel spokesman said today 
roberto ferrey secretary of the nicaraguan resistance 
directorate said by telephone from costa rica that the rebel 
delegation headed by alfredo cesar would go to managua later 
today 
the government of president daniel ortega had insisted that the 
talks scheduled to begin today be held here 
the rebels known as contras had refused to return to managua 
complaining of strict government limits on their activities during 
two previous sessions they wanted instead to meet with leftist 
sandinista officials in sapoa a post on the costa rican border 
where the two sides signed a preliminary peace plan on march 23 
the aim of the talks is to work out details of a permanent 
ceasefire in the war that ortega says has killed 26500 people and 
caused 3 billion in damage to the economy 
ferrey said the contras would go to managua with the 
understanding that there will be complete and unrestricted freedom 
of expression and the free right to meet with organizations and 
leaders 
the government had reiterated tuesday that it would allow the 
rebels to meet with the most important opposition group in the 
country the nicaraguan democratic coordinate visit the roman 
catholic bishops conference and the opposition daily la prensa as 
well as relatives 
presidential press secretary manuel espinoza said today that the 
government has everything ready to receive them 
american and honduran officials meanwhile said nicaragua 
appears to be building up arms stockpiles to attack the rebels if 
the peace talks fail according to a published report 
the new york times reported in todays editions that american 
and honduran officials cited aerial reconnaissance photographs of 
nicaraguan territory and other evidence they say suggest a 
sandinista military buildup 
us officials said the photos showed that airfields at wapsam 
near the honduran border and at la tranquera in southern nicaragua 
have been upgraded 
they say pictures also show new military storage depots are 
being built near sebaco 50 miles north of managua and that 
military supplies are being stockpiled at el tempisque just 
outside managua 
in washington a congressional aide said the rebels planned to 
offer to lay down their arms on sept 1 as part of a comprehensive 
peace accord to be presented to the sandinistas 
contra leader alfredo cesar said the proposal will include all 
the necessary things for a permanent end to the war in nicaragua 
ortega had argued that holding the talks in sapoa would be to 
put the conversations at the brink of breaking off and would mark 
a setback in political terms 
it would be to accept that all that has been achieved since 
the first contacts late last year can be lost he added 
in the initial sapoa plan the negotiators agreed on a 60day 
ceasefire to give time to arrange a more lasting peace 
the temporary truce was scheduled to run out on may 30 but 
ortega on monday announced he was unilaterally extending it for an 
additional 30 days 
in washington members of the rebels political directorate said 
they would not break the truce after it expires may 30 even if no 
new truce agreement is in effect but they said they were not 
officially accepting ortegas extension 
the contra leaders also said they would accept a proposal for 
delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside nicaragua by an 
agency with ties to the organization of american states

antarctic for research purposes 
the international whaling commission had passed a resolution 
opposing the hunt japanese officials say the commission has no 
power to ban such whaling 
researchers plan to study the health growth rates and diet of 
the whales japanese officials said 
in their letter hoelzel and amos said researchers have gained 
valuable information about whales from commercial and scientific 
whaling as well as from stranded animals 
but given what has already been discovered our new priority 
should be to characterize accurately the size of populations and 
their genetic status they wrote the technology needed to 
determine these fundamental population parameters without killing 
animals is at hand 
skin samples can be retrieved by firing a specialized arrow 
equipped to recover a skin sample and tethered to a fly casting 
reel into the animals skin they said 
genetic analysis can then determine each animals distinctive 
dna fingerprint providing an accurate method for population 
counts they said 
other genetic studies can trace reproductive behavior and the 
status of genes present in whale populations they said

genes play a major role in whether a honey bee 
serves its hive as a groomer guard or even an undertaker two 
studies suggest 
certain genes may make particular bees more responsive to 
environmental cues that trigger those behaviors the authors wrote 
the findings have substantial implications for our 
understanding of the evolution of division of labor in colonies of 
social insects michael breed of the university of colorado at 
boulder said in an editorial accompanying the papers which appear 
in thursdays issue of the british journal nature 
bee colonies are collections of subfamilies each created by the 
queen bee and a different drone 
researchers used artificial insemination to establish 
subfamilies that could later be differentiated then they looked 
for relationships between a bees subfamily and therefore its 
genetic inheritance and its job in the hive 
gene robinson and robert page jr of ohio state university 
studied worker bees that specialized in standing guard at the hive 
entrance or in removing corpses only a minority of bees do those 
jobs they wrote 
they found significant genetic differences between the groups 
and between each specialist group and other worker bees 
the other study found evidence for genetic influence on the 
tendency of worker bees to groom nestmates wrote peter frumhoff 
and jayne baker who did the work at the university of california 
at davis 
in the editorial breed said scientists should now see if queen 
bees choose a range of mates that would encourage variety in jobs 
queen bees mate up to 17 times he said

iowa democrats are nervously watching a 
crop of candidates loyal to political extremist lyndon larouche 
and worrying about a predicted dismal turnout in for june 7 primary 
featuring no statewide contests 
some top democrats even have endorsed republicans in a couple of 
legislative districts 
im confident that where there is a race were going to win 
said iowa democratic party spokesman phil roeder 
in all 16 larouche backers are running in iowa democratic 
primaries five seeking congressional nominations and the rest 
running in legislative districts 
roeder said democrats will work to make sure voters know which 
candidates back larouche and will deny them access to 
partysponsored events well be helping out the regular 
democratic candidates roeder said 
in 1986 three larouche backers ran for office when juan cortez 
of cedar rapids got nearly 18 percent of the vote in a us senate 
primary 
the increase has democrats scratching their heads because the 
states farmbased economy is improving 
the send them a message slogan that everybody was using in 
the midwest was very relevant we had big problems roeder said 
the general resentment toward government just isnt there this 
time 
few of the larouche candidates are actively campaigning though 
two legislative candidates will get the official party nomination 
because they are the only democrats on the ballot 
house speaker don avenson who runs democratic legislative 
elections has endorsed republican incumbents in those districts 
i far prefer a mainstream republican to a larouche backer 
avenson said 
were going to urge voters not to vote for them roeder 
said that means they either dont vote in that particular 
election or they vote for the republican 
while the number may have gone up this time the level of 
activity has gone down roeder said 
part of the reason democrats are nervous is the experience in 
neighboring illinois where two larouche backers won statewide 
primaries in the last election tossing that states party into 
turmoil and destroying efforts to unseat republican gov james 
thompson 
i think everybody learned a good lesson from illinois 
roeder said 
aggravating the worries is a projected low turnout which state 
officials say could be less than 15 per percent of the 16 million 
registered voters 
iowa political activists were wearied by months of intense 
presidential campaigning leading up to precinct caucuses feb 8 
and there are few races of interest to draw voters 
its the first election since 1976 in which neither a senate 
seat nor the governors office is at stake and all six incumbent 
congressmen are seeking reelection 
only freshman democrat david nagle in northeast iowas 3rd 
district has primary opposition and that comes from larouche 
backer james cox of grinnell 
in that district republicans don redfern and marvin simpson 
square off in a gop primary redfern wanted to run when the seat 
was open in 1986 but forgot to sign his nominating petition and 
missed the filing deadline by 15 minutes 
freshman republican rep fred grandy who for years played 
gopher on televisions love boat has no primary opposition in 
his bid for a second term from western iowas 6th district there 
are however four democrats running in a primary 
with little activity at the top of the ticket election 
officials say theyre counting on local elections to spark pockets 
of voter interest there are 30 democratic legislative primaries 
and 17 for republicans in addition sheriffs in all 99 of the 
states counties face election this year and that office usually 
gets heavy local attention 
as of this month iowa had 495182 registered republicans 
562039 registered democrats and 504082 registered voters who 
expressed no party preference

a naval investigator at a hearing for six 
sailors charged in the march 2 drowning of a recruit denied a 
defense request today to close the proceedings to the public 
the hearings which began today are the military equivalent of 
a grand jury inquiry 
lawyers for two of the sailors argued that extensive press 
coverage would prejudice any future panel that may consider the 
case if courtmartials are ordered in the death of airman recruit 
lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis 
cmdr daniel j dalesio jr the investigating officer said he 
may close portions of the hearings to consider whether certain 
evidence can be admitted or might prejudice any future 
courtmartial 
i think the law is clear if there is any closure it is to be 
done with a scalpel not an ax dalesio said 
mirecki died during rescue training exercises at a pensacola 
naval air station pool investigators said he was dragged into the 
pool against his will and his head held under water 
on may 10 five instructors were charged with involuntary 
manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery and their commanding 
officer was charged with dereliction of duty 
dalesio of the naval legal service office in philadelphia 
will recommend whether the charges should be handled at a 
presidential preference of the delegates selected or allocated thus

house democrats called today on the reagan 
administration to halt current deliveries of aid to nicaraguas 
contra rebels including plans for cash payments to the troops and 
set up a new delivery system through an organization linked to the 
organization of american states 
meeting in a closeddoor caucus party members approved a 
resolution stating that the current delivery system which 
includes a carrier with past ties to the cia violates a 
twomonthold ceasefire agreement and the legislation that 
provided 177 million in humanitarian aid 
the resolution called on the administration to make immediate 
arrangements for delivery of aid through the panamerican 
development foundation an oas arm that has been deemed 
acceptable to both the rebels and the sandinista government in 
public statements 
the state departments agency for international development 
which is administering the aid program has so far delivered 600 
metric tons of food clothing and other supplies to rebel forces 
inside honduras through other private contractors said aid 
spokesman roger noriega 
the loads delivered so far have been inspected by 
representatives of the catholic church in honduras to make sure 
they contain no lethal supplies noriega said most of the 
deliveries have been made by truck although there have been about 
a dozen airdrops he said 
aid also plans to begin this week purchasing cordobas the 
nicaraguan currency for distribution to rebel troops in the field 
as early as next week noriega added troops will receive about 1 
a day each he said 
noriega said aid could not begin to make delivery arrangements 
with the foundation as the democrats requested because it had no 
formal notification that the organization is acceptable to both 
sides 
there has to be a formal agreement in place he said we 
have said all along that the neutral delivery mechanism has to be 
part of an agreement between the resistance and the sandinista 
government 
he added it is wholly unrealistic to expect aid to talk with 
the padf in specific terms until there is a signed agreement or 
some kind of reliable public statement

superpower wrangling over president reagans 
prized spacebased missile defense is being viewed as the major 
stumbling block in negotiations to cut us and soviet longrange 
nuclear arsenals by up to 50 percent 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev had hoped to sign 
the treaty at their moscow summit beginning sunday 
the strategic arms reduction treaty would have slashed us and 
soviet strategic nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent by far the 
most radical achievement in the roller coaster history of arms 
control 
there are still unresolved problems about verification how for 
example could us monitors be sure the soviets were not illegally 
hiding missiles especially those that are hard to track mobile 
missiles are in this elusive category so are cruise missiles 
carried by planes and warships 
still the strategic defense initiative popularly called star 
wars and soviet attempts to constrain it turned out to be the 
main treaty spoiler 
the program launched by reagan five years ago is a 
multibilliondollar search for ways to use lasers kinetic energy 
or other futuristic technology to destroy soviet ballistic missiles 
as they hurtle through space toward their targets 
reagan and his supporters see the space defense program as a 
natural complement to nuclear weapons reductions they want to 
reduce offensive arms and also improve defenses so the weapons 
remaining in the soviet strategic arsenal have less of a chance of 
getting through 
besides they are convinced that the soviets while protesting 
star wars are quietly engaged in their own space defense program 
at the last superpower summit in washington in december the 
soviets proposed that the two sides agree to abide by the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty as signed and ratified 
the accord limited antimissile defenses on the theory that a 
potential aggressor would hesitate to launch an attack if his weak 
defense exposed his own country to devastating retaliation 
the united states countered proposing language to allow 
spacebased testing of star wars technology as required 
at the windup the two sides agreed on an ambiguous statement 
that included as signed from the soviet proposal and as 
required from the us side it did not settle the dispute over 
the future of star wars 
during negotiations this year in geneva the soviets proposed 
attaching to the start a protocol to limit space defense tests and 
demanded the right to stop cutting back their missiles if they 
concluded the us program violated the 1972 abm treaty however 
the us side refused 
instead the united states proposed that the soviets explicitly 
accept a broad interpretation of the 1972 treaty one that would 
give the current administration and succeeding ones a lot of 
running room to experiment in space the net result was deadlock 
referring to the star wars dispute and the verification 
problems secretary of state george p shultz said earlier this 
month its now clear there is no way these questions can be 
shaped up in treaty form in time for the summit 
so when reagan meets gorbachev in moscow they will have no 
treaty to sign 
all that will be ready for them to approve is a single provision 
designed to ease tensions it is a pledge for each side to notify 
the other before any missile test launchings

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis breezed through the capitol on wednesday picking up 
endorsements and advice from members of congress and declaring he 
will not concede one single state to the republicans in the 
fall campaign 
dukakis also met privately with defeated rival albert gore jr 
he got no endorsement there but said he and the tennessee senator 
had a very cordial meeting 
the massachusetts governor took a fresh shot at president 
reagans veto of trade legislation he said it was a tragedy to 
reject the big trade bill over a provision requiring companies to 
give their workers 60 days advance notice before shutting down a 
plant 
in a meeting with western lawmakers dukakis also criticized the 
administrations environmental policies saying offshore oil 
drilling should be a last resort not a first 
he made his fastpaced tour of the capitol before flying off on 
a western campaign swing including a wednesday night debate in san 
francisco with democratic rival jesse jackson 
dukakis expects to wrap up a nominating majority of democratic 
national convention delegates on june 7 the final day of the 
primary season when elections are set in california new jersey 
montana and new mexico 
several southern lawmakers observed pointedly that dukakis had 
fended off pressure during the primary campaign from traditional 
democratic interest groups and they said he would be a more 
popular general election candidate that walter f mondale was in 
1984 
sen terry sanford of north carolina said that four years ago 
mondale overpromised in the early primaries whereas dukakis did 
not that was a reference to the perception that mondale catered to 
a series of special interest groups during his campaign 
sen john breaux of louisiana said dukakis has been able to 
resist many demands that look good but turn out to pose problems 
later on 
dukakis said repeatedly he will contest bush in every state 
we are not going to concede one single state to the republicans 
in the fall he said 
the massachusetts governor held separate sessions with southern 
and western lawmakers where the talk centered on regional issues 
in contrast to the meetings in the capitol which were 
orchestrated for maximum news coverage the session with gore took 
place as quietly as could be managed 
it was not on dukakis printed schedule and the two men met 
privately in dukakis hotel room 
the massachusetts governor said they had had a very good 
conversation 
asked whether gore had agreed to release more than 350 delegates 
pledged to him dukakis repeated it was a very cordial 
meeting gore wrote his delegates last week urging them to stay 
loyal at least for the time being 
even so dukakis has been steadily whittling away at gores 
delegates as he has moved towards winning a nominating majority 
the lawmakers who endorsed dukakis during the day included 
sens sanford breaux dale bumpers of arkansas quentin burdick 
of north dakota wendell ford of kentucky harry reid of nevada and 
dennis deconcini of arizona 
among house members reps frank annunzio of illinois john 
bryant of texas norman dicks of washington william ford of 
michigan tony hall of ohio paul kanjorski of pennsylvania tom 
lantos leon panetta nancy pelosi pete stark tony beilenson vic

school children say they prefer watching 
television to any other leisure activity while reading is the 
least popular pastime according to a survey released wednesday 
grade schoolers also say they trust what they hear on television 
more than what they read in newspapers the survey released by 
weekly reader says 
in the lower grades they love reading books but that ardor 
cools by grades 4 to 6 the survey reported 
weekly reader said its survey of reading and tv habits was 
prompted in part because low test scores and high dropout and 
illiteracy rates indicate children are reading less than they once 
did 
survey results were compiled from teacher summaries representing 
about 117000 of more than 340000 children who answered 
questionnaires in class weekly reader said that statistically the 
survey was not a random sample whose results could be projected 
but it said the sample was large enough to be taken as 
representative 
some findings 
watching television was something 80 percent or more of all 
children in grades two through six said they liked a lot only 3 
percent or less said they didnt like tv 
among secondgraders 65 percent said they liked reading a lot 
and 8 percent said not at all by sixth grade only 39 percent had 
a strong yen to read 10 percent were antireading and the rest 
were lukewarm 
newspaper reading was popular with 28 percent of 
secondgraders but with only 11 percent of fifth and 
sixthgraders those who said they did not like reading newspapers 
at all ranged from 35 percent of sixthgraders to 43 percent of 
fourthgraders 
asked what they typically do at home 55 percent said watch tv 
14 percent play 14 percent talk on the telephone 11 percent 
listen to the radio and 6 percent read 
asked where they get their news 69 percent said television 23 
percent radio 5 percent magazines and 3 percent newspapers 
fiftyseven percent said they believed the tv news a lot but 
only 47 percent said they had strong faith in newspapers 45 
percent in radio and 15 percent in magazines

the us trade deficit narrowed dramatically 
during the first three months of the year as an alltime high in 
american export sales offset a relentless climb in imports the 
commerce department reported wednesday 
the trade deficit from january through march totaled 359 
billion a 127 percent drop from a deficit of 412 billion in the 
fourth quarter of 1987 
it was only the second quarterly improvement in the deficit in 
the past two years and it represented the biggest decline since the 
deficit fell by 189 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982 
analysts said the sharp narrowing showed that the united states 
has finally turned the corner on trade and should see in 1988 the 
first yearly decline in the trade deficit since 1980 
we believe that 1988 will finally be the year of the 
turnaround and these figures support that prediction said 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc an economic 
consulting firm in lexington mass 
she predicted the trade deficit would fall this year by about 10 
percent from last years record 1603 billion deficit when 
measured on a balanceofpayments basis 
the new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown 
up in the departments monthly merchandise trade reports the 
earlier figures showed a 164 percent drop in the deficit to 36 
billion in the first quarter compared with 431 billion in the 
fourth quarter of 1987 
wednesdays figures are smaller because they subtract factors 
such as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers 
the balanceofpayments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal 
variations the monthly figures are not 
we are making slow but steady improvement but we shouldnt 
get too confident said jay goldinger chief economist with 
capital insight a los angeles investment firm we wont see 
progress in reducing the deficit continue at this rate 
the improvement in the first quarter came from a 98 percent 
surge in export sales which rose to a record high of 747 
billion as american companies continued to enjoy an export boom 
fueled by the weaker dollar 
since the spring of 1985 the dollar has fallen in value by 50 
percent against the currencies of japan and many european 
countries making us products more competitive overseas 
unfortunately the weaker dollar has driven up the cost of 
imports as well in the first quarter they rose to a record high of 
1106 billion 13 percent above the fourthquarter level 
analysts termed the continued rise in imports disappointing but 
ms latta noted that much of the growth in imports apparently came 
not from consumer demand but from a pickup in business spending as 
us factories boosted investment to expand production facilities 
in order to meet the increased export demand 
she said this business investment should slow in coming 
quarters and this would help lower imports 
the reagan administration is counting on strong export sales to 
provide close to half of total economic growth in the united states 
this year as well as blunt the drive by congress to enact trade 
legislation that the white house considers protectionist 
president reagan cited the improving trade figures on tuesday 
when he vetoed the omnibus trade bill 
the figures are in current dollars before adjusting for price 
changes caused by the decline in the value of the dollar since 
1985 when inflation is factored out the trade deficit in volume 
terms fell 128 percent in the first quarter to 367 billion when 
expressed in 1982 dollars 
in current dollars the trade deficit with japan fell by 19 
billion to 129 billion in the first quarter the trade deficit 
with western europe dropped by an even sharper 38 billion to 45 
billion the deficit with the newly industrialized countries of 
singapore hong kong south korea and taiwan fell by 11 billion 
to 69 billion

only a year ago one of the hottest 
topics of public debate in western europe was president reagans 
plan for a missile defense system in space 
today its rarely mentioned and when it is talked about there 
is little of the urgency or anguish that punctuated the earlier 
discussion 
theres a more relaxed attitude now said peter corterier a 
west german who is secretarygeneral of the north atlantic 
assembly an advisory body of legislators from 16 nato countries 
the main reason a growing number of american allies in the 
north atlantic treaty organization suspect the us publics 
enthusiasm for reagans strategic defense initiative popularly 
known as star wars has passed its highwater mark 
its becoming less likely that it ever will come about says 
ton frinking a centrist christian democrat and member of the dutch 
parliament 
the europeans recognize that the issue of spacebased defenses 
is still an important obstacle to a ussoviet agreement on 
reductions in longrange nuclear weapons 
but as reagan headed for moscow for his fourth meeting with 
mikhail s gorbachev the europeans appeared less concerned that 
sdi would be the main problem 
the soviets strongly oppose the plan saying it would lead to an 
arms race in space they have insisted that reagan renounce the 
program although the vehemence of the soviet argument has subsided 
recently 
it seems to be negotiable now said frinking adding that a 
key reason for this was mounting concern in congress about the cost 
of the program 
the americans arent going to pay for it frinking said in a 
recent interview noting that the next us administration will 
inherit huge budget and trade deficits 
reagan insists he will not drop the idea of building the 
defensive shield which he said could make nuclear weapons 
impotent and obsolete but the program faces severe financial 
constraints 
for the current budget year the defense department has been 
allotted 36 billion for sdi research thats 17 billion less 
than it wanted 
for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the house armed services 
committee has recommended holding the research allotment to 41 
billion defense secretary frank c carlucci said the amount is too 
small and will lead to major restructuring and delays in the 
program 
frinking and other europeans say their doubts about the future 
of the program are strengthened by recent reports suggesting sdi 
may wither in the 1990s 
the defense science board an independent pentagon advisory 
panel said in a report this month that sdi initially should be 
scaled back to a limited groundbased defense against missiles 
when he first proposed the idea in march 1983 reagan said he 
wanted a spacebased shield that could protect not only north 
america but also western europe from ballistic missile attack 
reagans vision which he linked to the possibility of 
eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide stirred heated debate in 
europe some said it brought into doubt the basic nato strategy of 
deterring attack by maintaining large arsenals of offensive nuclear 
weapons 
many west european governments were ambivalent if not hostile 
to reagans proposal among their concerns was that it might 
provide only a limited defense for europe 
three years ago british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
said sdi raised crucial questions for nato strategy he suggested 
that a spacebased shield could be outflanked by relatively 
simpler and demonstrably cheaper countermeasures 
among the nato allies only britain west germany and italy have 
signed formal agreements to participate in research for the 
program there are indications that even these three are not 
entirely happy with it 
in september the north atlantic assembly adopted a report 
accusing washington of breaking a promise to offer its allies more 
than a token role in sdi research it said nonamerican companies 
had been awarded less than 100 million in contracts through the 
end of 1986 compared with 73 billion for us firms 
despite this irritation the us allies rarely raise the star 
wars issue any more 
in a special report this month on the future of the western 
alliance a select committee of the north atlantic assembly 
expounded on nearly every aspect of defense and security including 
natos technological challenges there was not a single word about 
sdi

a new treaty making deep cuts in each 
superpowers arsenal of longrange nuclear weapons could be 
dangerous because the soviets could either cheat or legally evade 
limits in the pact a house armed services study contended 
wednesday 
the report was issued an hour after president reagan left for 
moscow and his summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev one of the topics on the agenda is the proposed 
strategic arms reduction talks start 
no start agreement will come out of the summit next week and 
thats good said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
committee there is a great deal to be done before arms control 
policy and weapons system decisions are harmonized 
the proposed start agreement would affect the longrange arsenal 
of each nation it is being negotiated now and is designed as a 
successor to the separate ussoviet treaty eliminating 
mediumrange missiles a pact now before the senate for 
ratification 
the outlines of the proposed start agreement generally call for 
each side to cut its longrange arsenal by about 50 percent to 
6000 weapons aspin said 
but weaponscounting provisions which aspin said have already 
been agreed to on both sides would allow the soviets to legally add 
as many as 3000 warheads and the soviets could add up to 4300 
more if they cheat the wisconsin democrat noted 
all of this does not mean we should abandon arms control 
generally or start in particular aspin said what it does say 
is that we should look to the structure of our own forces to 
guarantee deterrence 
the warnings were issued by the defense policy panel an armed 
services subcommittee which aspin has used to examine arms control 
issues 
the proposed limit of 6000 weapons is an illusion the 
study said that is because of the proposed counting rules which 
treat each bomber as a single weapon regardless of how many 
nuclear weapons such as bombs or missiles are carried on each 
plane 
the united states also would be allowed similar additional 
weapons it said in fact because the united states has more 
bombers it would probably end up with more legal weapons 
thus the actual ceiling on weapons under start is more like 
900010000 on each side rather than 6000 the panel said 
the soviets would also be able to cheat particularly since the 
proposed start pact would not ban flight tests of permitted 
weapons weapons could be hidden without fears about their 
capability because some could be flighttested it noted 
the issue is similar to one which was raised as part of the 
mediumrange missile pact aspin said among the weapons banned by 
that pact is the soviet ss20 and the soviets have declared a 
stockpile of 250 of the weapons which must be destroyed 
some us intelligence agencies believe that even more ss20s 
may be hidden but their military value will degrade according to 
supporters of the treaty because the pact bans any flight tests 
start will not ban flight tests so the military capability of 
any concealed forces will not decline over time giving the 
soviets incentive to cheat the study said 
it said the soviets could also break out any start treaty 
quicker than the united states 
the reason is that given the history of us strategic arms 
development it seems unlikely that the president would propose 
such a course a breakout or the congress approve it a us 
planner however could not rely upon internal checks and balances 
in the soviet union 
thus the united states must plan for a soviet force not of 
6000 weapons but of many many more the study said 
stricter verification is not the answer because no verification 
is likely to be strict enough it said besides procedures such as 
anytime anywhere inspections might hurt the united states because 
the soviet inspections would be given the same right to look at 
us facilities

involving the darts in recent years according to commission 
records in addition an estimated 670 lawndart injuries are 
treated annually at hospital emergency rooms 
lawn darts which have long metal tips have become popular as a 
yard game they are tossed through the air with the points 
sticking into the ground in or near a target 
the 21 vote called for a ban on lawn darts with the long 
dangerous metal tips some darts on the market with blunt plastic 
tips would not be banned 
the matter now goes back to the commission staff to develop a

us and panamanian negotiators were close to 
agreement today on a deal leading to gen manuel antonio noriegas 
resignation as his nations defense chief and departure in august 
a reagan administration official said 
the official who insisted on anonymity said it was his 
understanding that an agreement was consummated this morning 
but added that the package could not be considered completed until 
noriega confirms it with a public announcement which could come 
later in the day 
according to the official both governments were preparing 
formal announcements the key provisions of the deal reportedly 
include noriegas resignation as commanderinchief of panamas 
defense forces and subsequent departure from panama and the 
dismissal of us drug smuggling indictments against him 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater en route to helsinki 
finland with president reagan told reporters at midday 
its still a daytoday proposition we could hear something 
at any time 
the cable news network said that panamaniam ambassador juan b 
sosa reported that a deal had been worked out 
us officials said that us envoy michael g kozak had worked 
with panamanian officials until the early morning hours in panama 
hoping to complete an agreement before president reagan left at 
midmorning for helsinki finland and eventually moscow for the 
summit meeting with mikhail s gorbachev that begins sunday 
the administration apparently was intent on reaching an 
agreement before reagans departure because it did not want the 
panama issue to overshadow his visits to finland and the soviet 
union 
secretary of state george p shultz indicated on tuesday the 
administration was prepared to suspend the talks for the duration 
of reagans absence from washington if no agreement was reached 
today state department spokesman charles redman said shultz 
who was to accompany reagan on the trip to finland delayed his 
departure until later in the day to monitor the situation in panama 
redman said the talks were continuing but he gave no details 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said today im 
for no deal 
he said it sounds to me like a deal that will get the 
president out of town give prestige to noriega and dump the 
problem in the next presidents lap 
sosa who has been allied with administration efforts to ease 
noriega from power said tuesday that the plan being worked on by 
the negotiators is certain to be rejected by the democratic 
opposition in panama 
the antinoriega forces will reject the deal sosa told a 
news conference there will be no peace in panama the turmoil 
will continue 
he said that the deal would enable the criminal empire 
noriega has created within the panamanian defense forces to remain 
in place and that it would not ensure that the scheduled 
presidential elections in 1989 will be free 
shultz disputed sosas contention that kozak was attempting to 
negotiate panamas political future in violation of diplomatic 
norms 
what gets put together there is up to the people of panama 
shultz said 
sosa who has continued to function as panamas ambassador in 
washington despite noriegas efforts to fire him confirmed many of 
the previously reported details about the arrangement that kozak is 
negotiating 
he said that noriega would resign as commander of the defense 
forces in august and leave pamana afterward returning once an 
elected civilian government is installed in may 1989 in the 
interim he would be allowed to return to panama for holidays the 
us indictments against him would be withdrawn and the economic 
sanctions the administration has imposed against panama would be 
lifted once noriega leaves 
president manuel solis palma who replaced ousted president eric 
arturo delvalle in february would continue to govern the country 
but the united states would still consider delvalle as the 
legitimate authority sosa said 
the state department position is that the indictments are 
unenforceable and that their dismissal would be a small price to 
pay for noriegas departure 
but sosa said that the proposed deal would change little in 
panama amounting to norieguismo without noriega 
sosa took his criticism of the administrations position on 
monday to assistant secretary of state elliott abrams one of the 
chief architects of us policy 
the administration view sosa said is that noriega would lose 
some power when he steps down as defense chief and lose even more 
when he goes into exile as the administration sees it assurances 
of a free press would be a further guarantee that democracy will be 
restored sosa said 
but sosa disagreed we shouldnt sacrifice principle for 
expediency he said no deal is better than a bad deal

israel launched a 5 million advertising 
campaign wednesday to counter the crippling effects on its tourist 
industry of the nearly 6monthold arab uprising in the occupied 
territories 
officials had hoped to reap a tourist bonanza on israels 40th 
anniversary but now theyre anticipating a drop of about 300 
million that would make tourism the nations biggest source of 
foreign capital the industry hardest hit by the unrest 
its a disaster the cancellations are coming in a murderous 
rhythm im losing hundreds of thousands of dollars said shimon 
shtern a hotel owner and chairman of the hotel association in 
netanya a popular mediterranean resort 
shterns 150room netanya hanesicha hotel is operating at 10 
percent of capacity and 63 hotel employees have been fired this 
month as a result 
shtern says each time his office telex switches on his hopes 
rise the telex starts up we all get excited and its another 
cancellation we dont even ask the reason anymore he said 
by comparison 1987 was a record year for israeli tourism with 
152 million visitors bringing in 16 billion 
on wednesday prime minister yitzhak shamir got the first 
official look at the advertising campaign slated for europe and 
the united states under the slogan israel see for yourself 
the ads feature television endorsements from american tourists 
saying how safe israels popular vacation spots are 
the idea were selling is israel isnt just the west bank 
its masada eilat jaffa oranges all these wonderful things 
said al lieberman president of new yorkbased grey advertising 
one of the companies involved in the campaign 
when theres a crisis on we cant compete with the front 
page but after people read the headlines these ads say forget 
whats going on in gaza its beautiful here in israel 
lieberman said 
israels tourism ministry is also treating european and american 
travel agents to allexpenses paid tours of israel to promote the 
country to help israeli hoteliers the ministry contributes two 
dollars for every dollar an owner spends to advertise his hotel 
abroad 
but some hotel owners have already complained that the 5 
million budget for the campaign is not enough to effectively fight 
israels tarnished image brought about not only by the unrest but 
by the armys handling of it 
more than 190 palestinians have been killed mostly by israeli 
army gunfire since december two israelis have died 
five million dollars when we are going to lose hundreds of 
millions is nothing its a drop in the bucket if you spend that 
little you might as well do nothing at all said yehuda 
greenbaum chairman of the jerusalem hotel association 
what we have today is as much an image problem as a security 
problem said yaacov katz marketing manager of the israel hotel 
association which represents the countrys 320 hotels 
people are not just worrying about rocks or terrorist acts 
the problem is that in the united states israels image has been 
sullied its a political problem something weve never tackled 
before he said in an interview 
katz believes the lost revenue will amount to 500 million 
instead of the 300 million estimated by the tourism ministry 
twenty percent fewer americans came to israel in april compared 
with the same month last year and the biggest decline was among 
american jews according to tourism ministry spokeswoman dvora 
gananielad 
tourism in march and april slid 23 percent compared to the first 
two months of the year and advance bookings have plummeted in 
europe alone about 60000 people have called off plans to travel 
to israel 
tourism buses standing idle in their lots have prompted israels 
largest bus company egged to announce it will lay off 500 
employees the hilton hotel in tel aviv has already fired 180 
workers and reduced the remainder of its 650member staff from a 
six to a fiveday work week

hail apparently knocked out both engines of a 
new boeing 737 forcing the jet to glide to a landing on a narrow 
strip of grass 20 miles short of new orleans airport a federal 
investigator said today 
passengers broke into applause for the pilot who safely brought 
down the taca international airlines jet tuesday without injury to 
the 40 or so people aboard the flight from el salvador to new 
orleans 
apparently the pilot ran into a hail storm and that knocked 
the engines out said jo johnson an investigator with the 
national transportation safety board office in fort worth texas 
the damage that was caused by the denting of the jet turbine 
blades was probably the major factor in the loss of power he 
said 
the 3weekold boeing 737300 jet remained on the grassy strip 
where it glided to a stop between an irrigation canal and a ship 
channel johnson said the ntsb federal aviation administration and 
taca officials are investigating 
i suspect theyll probably grade the strip down and fly it 
out later johnson said except for the engines the plane 
apparently suffered no damage 
at the time of the flight the entire gulf region was under 
national weather service warnings for severe thunderstorms 
including hail and high winds for several hours storm clouds were 
reported as high as 50000 feet 
the plane was going up and down sideways and twisting 
said the rev leo humphrey 52 a baptist missionary lightning 
was everywhere the lights went out on the plane and the engine 
died everyone thought it was over 
as the pilot said by the grace of god i got this sucker on 
the ground humphrey said after the smooth landing 
taca based in san salvador el salvador has business offices 
in new orleans the flight had made a stop in the central american 
country of belize 
the taca plane was at 11000 feet when it was diverted 15 miles 
to the naval air station at suburban belle chasse said a source 
with the federal aviation administration 
the pilot then managed to restart both engines the source said 
and asked for clearance to new orleans international before power 
went out again 
flying at about 5000 feet the pilot then was diverted 6 miles 
away to the less congested lakefront airport said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the pilot responded with two mayday messages and began 
looking for somewhere else to land the source said 
the plane came to a stop on the grounds of a national 
aeronautics and space administration complex in eastern new 
orleans five miles short of lakefront airport the wings barely 
fit between the drainage canal and the levee 
officials have put the total number of passengers and crew 
aboard the craft between 45 and 36 
two witnesses said they heard no engine sounds as the plane 
landed 
saidy duran 35 of costa rica said she and other passengers 
showed their appreciation with a round of applause a big one 
the pilot carlos dardano about 35 is from san salvador and 
has been with taca about five years said peter messina the 
airlines us regional manager 
hes a pretty cool captain he doesnt get flustered very 
easily messina said 
crew members refused to talk with reporters 
we went through rain and severe turbulence and i thought i 
heard them say lightning hit the plane said passenger july mora 
25 of new orleans 
officials could not confirm the report

55 percent from the 1985 book far above the normal 10 percent to 
15 percent authors receive 
common cause president fred wertheimer last week asked for an 
investigation of whether wrights campaign committees were involved 
in publishing or selling the book which could be a violation of 
house or other federal conflictofinterest rules 
the texas democrat indicated today that publication of the book 
had been halted at his orders 
the speaker said that longtime campaign supporter william 
carlos moore who published the book wanted last year to reprint 
20000 more and i said no wright added that he wanted to be free 
to concentrate on being speaker 
i told carlos its just not worth it wright said he said 
he bought 1300 worth of books in the last few days to be handed 
out to house members 
wright also sent a letter tuesday night to the ethics committee 
promising his cooperation if there is an investigation 
although i know my actions have been in full accordance with 
house rules i am concerned that the matters raised have led to 
increased public discussion which i believe is unwarranted he 
said 
therefore i wish to inform you that i will cooperate 
fully with any examination you may desire to make of these matters 
i hope that any such review will be resolved promptly he said 
rep newt gingrich rga has said he will make a formal 
request for an ethics investigation if a member makes a request

a judge has ordered a state agency to return 
about 800000 in sales taxes he said was wrongfully imposed on 
singersongwriter joni mitchell and the rock group america 
an attorney for miss mitchell and america said the decision by 
superior court judge aurelio munoz could open the way for 
recoveries by other recording artists 
the state had assessed the 6 percent sales tax on the theory 
that artists sell their master recordings to record companies 
in exchange for royalties the state called the master recordings 
tangible personal property 
attorneys for miss mitchell and the duo america composed of 
gerald beckley and lee bunnell had argued that they were not paid 
for their master recordings but rather for personal services and 
are thus not subject to a sales tax 
the state board of equalization began applying the sales tax to 
recording artists in the early 1970s 
state legislation prohibited the practice in regard to records 
issued after jan 1 1976 but the board continued to tax artists 
on recordings made before that date 
attorney paul hall told daily variety on monday that several 
other performers including neil young have litigation that could 
be affected by the case decided may 4

planners of the summer olympics in south korea 
are treating threats of attacks by north korea with total 
seriousness a highranking state department official says 
undersecretary of state edward j derwinski who has been 
representing the united states in international olympic 
discussions said in an interview on tuesday there is an 
extraordinary potential threat posed by the north koreans 
concern about north korean moves to disrupt the games has been 
heightened since late 1987 when that communist country was blamed 
by us officials for the bombing of a south korean jetliner with 
115 people aboard 
asked if security officials remained concerned that north korea 
might try to disrupt the seoul olympics derwinski said were 
taking them possible threats with total seriousness logically 
so 
north koreas realization that south korean organizers are 
planning the games in a very excellent fashion has increased 
the frustration and bitterness of the north koreans derwinski 
added 
north and south korea have been bitter foes since the late 1940s 
when the country was partitioned even if the olympics werent 
being held in seoul south korea there would still be worries 
about terrorism by wellknown nationalist groups 
you have this increase in sikh terrorism the lashing out at 
almost any indian the armenian terrorists periodically try attacks 
on turks the ira and their activities the plo going back to 
munich all of these are inherently out there the japanese red 
army the italian red brigades derwinski said 
he said south korea has been working on security since 1984 and 
should be able to handle the job when the games are held sept 
17oct 2 
i see no problem that i would attribute to indifference or 
complacency derwinski said the problem would be just how 
efficient the overall operation is pitted against whatever actions 
a couple of terrorist groups might take 
despite the concern about north korean disruption efforts 
olympic organizers are keeping the door open to that countrys 
participation in the games even though the official deadline for 
signing up passed in january 
quite frankly i think if the north koreans announced the day 
before the games that they were sending down 500 athletes they 
would come across the border unmolested derwinski said 
theres no real deadline 
cuba vietnam nicaragua seychelles and ethiopia have also 
failed to sign up for the games derwinski said he was not 
optimistic cuba would decide to take part because of cuban leader 
fidel castros close ties to north korean leader kim il sung 
if castro were being practical rather than having a dogmatic 
were told special relationship with kim il sung hed have in 
mind the excellence of the cuban boxing team their volleyball 
team their mens handball team some of their track and field 
people plus baseball derwinski said 
keeping in mind the excellence of these athletes it would be 
to his advantage in terms of international stature to have them on 
center stage he castro seems to have his priorities screwed up 
right now i guess we cant be too optimistic

the blood of 10000 new inmates from across the 
united states will be tested this summer as part of an effort to 
measure the spread of the disease among prisoners 
this study is not intended to identify people or identify risk 
groups said joanne ullrich coordinator of the project at johns 
hopkins school of public health the purpose of the study is to 
find out the prevalence rates of human immunodeficiency virus 
infection of people coming into the prison system so the systems 
can plan for what they are coming up against 
the study is being funded under a 332000 grant from the 
federal centers for disease control 
the blood samples will be coded to ensure neither inmates nor 
prison officials learn who is infected ms ullrich said 
information about sexual orientation or drug use will not be 
collected 
the prisoners age gender entrance date length of sentence 
and offense will be known that will give prison officials a broad 
profile of hivinfected patients researchers said 
results should help prison officials project the number of 
inmates who may eventually develop acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome and in turn plan services and prevention programs ms 
ullrich said doctors are unsure exactly what percentage of 
hivinfected people will develop aids but many experts believe the 
figure is at least half 
aids attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a variety of infections 
dr t forham brewer medical director of the maryland division 
of correction said the study is the first survey of hivinfection 
among inmates in a geographically diverse slice of the nations 
prisons 
in a survey by the national institute of justice aids cases in 
prisons rose 59 percent in the year ending oct 1 1987 from 1232 
to 1964 cases compared with a 61 percent increase in the general 
population 26002 to 41770 the survey was based on reports from 
70 federal state and local correctional systems 
the survey however did not measure the prevalence of hiv 
infection in the prison population the only reliable predictor of 
how many inmates may develop aids 
the johns hopkins study will screen the blood of 1000 inmates 
entering each of 10 prisons the study will be repeated next year 
hopkins investigators have said they not identify the prisons until 
the study is complete 
participating prisons will siphon off a small amount of the 
blood that is already routinely drawn to test for syphilis 
gonorrhea anemia and other diseases the samples will be shipped 
to johns hopkins

many of the nations pollutionfighters at the 
headquarters of the environmental protection agency have been 
gasping and wheezing from an air pollution problem apparently 
caused by new carpeting 
sixtyfive employees have sought medical attention and seven 
cant enter the building at all because of their reactions when 
they do william hirzy presidentelect of local 2050 of the 
national federation of federal employees said wednesday 
hirzy said he was 90 percent certain the reactions came from 
exposure to phenylcyclohexene a gas given off by the backing of 
new rugs the agency has been installing in the building used by 
5100 employees 
from talk in the halls i would guess that the number affected 
is at least 100 but not all have reported to the agencys health 
office hirzy said 
the agency has stopped putting in new carpets but charles 
grizzle assistant administrator for administration said 
phenylcyclohexene had not been fixed definitely as the cause of the 
problem and i dont see any reason to rip up the carpets until we 
are sure 
so far tests have shown nothing above background levels of 
any toxic chemicals grizzle said but the results of tests for 
phenylcyclohexene are not yet known hirzy said tests of the air of 
a warehouse containing about 175 remaining rolls of carpet showed a 
concentration of 60 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion the 
odor of the gas can be detected at concentrations of as little as 1 
ppb to 3 ppb 
about 100 rolls of carpet already have been installed 
little is known about the effects of phenylcyclohexene and there 
are no standards for workplace exposure but there is some 
indication that it damages lung tissue and intestinal mucous 
membranes in laboratory animals said hirzy a chemist 
the agency has not yet decided what to do about the seven 
employees who cant enter the building some are on sick leave 
some are using vacation time and some are being permitted to work 
at home hirzy said 
grizzle however said we are giving our employees the 
maximum relief we can and help with workmens compensation cases at 
the labor department while the agency tries to decide on a policy 
epa has asked the governments housekeeping agency the general 
services administration for space elsewhere if it is forced to 
relocate employees he said 
hirzy said the union had been pressing for removal of the new 
carpets but was rebuffed in a very stormy meeting of the 
unionmanagement facilities advisory committee on april 28 
epa officials proposed to steamclean the new carpets air them 
out and relay them hirzy said not only will it not work it 
doesnt make sense from a public policy standpoint its not the 
job of government employees to be used as test animals 
industrial hygienists say the sick building problem like 
epas is often caused by poor ventilation grizzle said i have 
asked our folks to make sure we are doing everything we can to 
improve ventilation i am told the dampers are open as far as they 
can go i am just a layman but it does seem to me we lack fresh 
air in here 
the epa building which was constructed in 1971 near the 
waterfront in the citys southwestern section is almost totally 
sealed many of epas employees work in cramped quarters in offices 
without windows and those who rank high enough to rate a window 
find they cannot open it 
grizzle said the agency has 125 square feet per employee below 
the 135 square feet gsa specifies for new offices

a congressman said wednesday he favors a 
proposal by immigration officials to set aside up to 200000 visas 
to spouses and children who didnt qualify for amnesty but whose 
relatives did 
rep charles schumer dny said he plans to incorporate the 
plan of the immigration and naturalization service into legislation 
he introduced with two other congressmen 
its humane its progressive its an excellent program and 
it will make the lives of hundreds of thousands of people easier 
because it will keep family units together said schumer 
under the visa plan favored by ins once an illegal immigrant 
obtains permanent residency under the amnesty program immediate 
family members would qualify for permanent resident status rather 
than facing lengthy waits 
the average wait for legal status for immigrants from most 
countries is 1 years and there is a 10year wait for spouses and 
children of permanent residents who want to immigrate to the united 
states from mexico 
the ins says the immigration reform and control act of 1986 does 
not allow it to grant a special benefit to ineligible family 
members and that the agency must treat each case individually the 
ins is allowing relatives to remain in the united states 
indefinitely for humanitarian reasons under voluntary departure 
status 
the 1986 law allows illegal aliens who came to the united states 
before jan 1 1982 and who have lived here since to qualify for 
amnesty under a oneyear program that ended may 4 some 16 million 
people applied

stoic observer 
one prospective juror who was accepted tuesday said she felt 
sympathy for mecham while others said they did not believe he 
should have faced recall from the governorship so soon after he 
took office in january 1987 
another prospective panelist said mecham has had a very big 
mouth through this whole thing and got himself into a lot of 
trouble because of the way he was so hardheaded prosecutors 
unsuccessfully sought to exclude her 
one man said mecham seemed to make goofs mistakes errors 
bad judgment that has nothing to do with his integrity 
all the prospective jurors however said they believed they 
could be fair in the trial 
mecham faces six felony counts of perjury willful concealment 
and filing false documents and faces up to 22 years in prison if 
convicted on all counts his brother faces three similar counts and 
up to 9 years if convicted of all three 
the former republican governor and his brother have denied all 
wrongdoing in failing to report the loan from a tempe developer 
opening statements are scheduled for june 2 the day after the 
arizona supreme court is to hear arguments on the defenses request 
that the charges be returned to the state grand jury for a new 
determination of probable cause 
the original pool of 99 possible jurors was narrowed to 51 on 
monday after lawyers and ryan examined questionnaires filled out 
last week 
mecham was removed from office april 4 when the state senate 
convicted him on two impeachment counts of misusing a protocol fund 
and of obstructing justice he was impeached in connection with the 
350000 loan but the senate decided not to hear the charge for 
fear of prejudicing the criminal trial

intelligence operatives floated a plan in 1985 
to send agents to france to seize a man believed to be behind the 
kidnapping of americans in the middle east but the state 
department torpedoed the proposal a us official and a broadcast 
report said wednesday 
american intelligence received word in the autumn of 1985 that 
imad mugniyeh a lebanese shiite linked to terrorist attacks was 
visiting france and proposed that he be abducted to the united 
states for trial said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the state department fearing the action would cause a major 
blowup in usfrench relations argued successfully against the 
plan and a decision was made to ask french authorities to arrest 
mugniyeh france did not act on the request the official said 
national public radio which first disclosed the plan in a 
broadcast wednesday morning said its sources disagreed on whether 
president reagan approved the plan at any rate the broadcast 
said secretary of state george p shultz and fbi director william 
webster scuttled the proposal 
npr said the idea was conceived by william j casey then 
director of the central intelligence agency but that it was never 
completely proven that mugniyeh was in france at the time his 
abduction was to be carried out 
in early 1986 following a second report of mugniyehs presence 
in france local authorities did act on the us request and went 
to a hotel to arrest him but instead of a lebanese terrorist 
police found a family of vacationers npr reported 
mugniyeh has been identified by us terrorism experts as the 
leader of islamic jihad an iranianbacked group held responsible 
for the kidnapping of westerners in lebanon including associated 
press chief middle east correspondent terry anderson and several 
other americans 
mugniyeh is under indictment in the united states on charges of 
participating in the june 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner and the 
killing of navy diver robert stethem one of the passengers 
state department officials have also said they suspect that 
mugniyeh was involved in last months hijacking of a kuwaiti 
jetliner which was held for two weeks by gunmen demanding the 
release of more than two dozen shiite moslems being held on 
terrorism charges in kuwait mugniyehs brotherinlaw is said to 
be one of the prisoners 
the plane hijackers disappeared in algeria after they released 
their remaining hostages 
the us official who spoke of the proposal to abduct mugniyeh 
said theres always a lot of brainstorming about this sort of 
thing it was an idea that was floated people were saying how 
can we do this 
the state department felt strongly that if something like this 
was to be done it could not be through secret connivance there 
had to be a decision by french political authorities to arrest him 
and turn him over to the united states he said

fear of higher taxes was the key factor 
behind voters rejection of the proposed new city of lake tahoe 
spokesmen for both sides said 
the measure which was fought by local hotelcasino interests 
lost by a 1001802 vote in a special election tuesday in this 
mountain resort area 
the proposed city would have embraced the casino area of 
stateline and smaller communities along about 15 miles of lake 
tahoes southeastern shore it would have had a population of about 
6500 
the tax scare did it said bill bigham a leader of the 
movement to create the city he also blamed casinos for the outcome 
the casinos scared their employees into voting against the 
city saying there would be chaos said bigham a local bank 
manager 
the leader of the opposition ron nino said he was very pleased 
with the vote our arguments were more credible particularly 
regarding a tax increase he said 
the oppositions vigorous advertising campaign received 
financial support from the stateline casinos whose tax burden nino 
said would rise by at least 300000 yearly under a city government 
commissioners of douglas county which would have lost about 
18 million in yearly tax revenue to the city mostly from the 
large stateline casinos had advised voters to reject the plan 
we believed there was going to be a substantial tax 
increase said nino who runs a property management business 
people will pay more for more but we didnt see where there was 
going to be more we saw the same or less 
the proposal lost in all the lakeshore communities although 
proponents had argued that those communities which comprise 25 
percent of douglas countys population do not receive a share in 
services proportionate to the tax revenue they contribute 
the issue prompted an unusually high turnout of 60 percent said 
douglas county clerk barbara reed she said a normal turnout was 
3540 percent

three men stole 81 pay telephones altered 
their electronics and reinstalled them elsewhere enabling one of 
the thieves to continue collecting callers money police said 
the alleged ringleader lou vagnoni 60 changed the locks on 
the coin boxes removed labels identifying the owner and changed a 
computer chip inside police said 
the telephones were valueda at 265275 the amount of money 
received by operating them illegally could not be determined 
police said 
police commissioner kevin tucker and district attorney ronald 
castille charged tuesday that vagnoni paid robert paige 31 and 
david olsen 22 to steal phones for him at 150 each throughout 
philadelphia 
the stolen telephones were then operated by needaphone a 
philadelphia pay telephone company in which vagnoni is a silent 
partner police said other partners were unaware of the 
activities police said 
about onequarter of the telephones belonged to bell of 
pennsylvania while the remainder belonged to members of the 
central atlantic payphone association a network of private 
companies that operate pay telephones 
the three men were charged with 60 counts each of theft 
conspiracy and unlawful use of computers 
the case broke in february when police sgt terry levins spotted 
paige and olsen dislodging a telephone and its steel base said 
detective philip silverman an investigation traced the men to 
vagnoni he said 
bystanders would spot the two men but they appeared to be 
utility people said deputy police commissioner willie williams 
it was when the owners of the equipment came by to service the 
phones and found the equipment gone that a pattern began to be 
noticed

a palestinian general strike shut down the 
occupied territories wednesday and the israeli army imposed curfews 
that confined 200000 arabs to their homes 
lt gen dan shomron chief of staff said the army has punished 
dozens of soldiers for violating orders since the arab rebellion 
began dec 8 in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
he did not elaborate but the army has issued rules on when 
soldiers are allowed to fire on or beat protesters 
shomron also said the violence has lessened the influence of 
jordans king hussein in the territories which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war and undermined his 
usefulness in peace negotiations 
the uprising in the territories has weakened jordans 
position as a potential partner for negotiations he told foreign 
reporters we hear voices today that king hussein is retreating 
from positions he had taken before the uprising began 
soldiers shot a palestinian youth during a clash with young 
arabs hurling rocks and bottles in the nur shams refugee camp near 
tulkarem in the west bank the army said officials at rafidiyeh 
hospital in nablus said he was critically wounded in the chest 
hundreds of arabs have been wounded since the rebellion began 
among the 15 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza at 
least 195 have been killed and an israeli soldier and a jewish 
settler also have been slain 
indefinite curfews were imposed on the dheishe refugee camp in 
the west bank and on nine camps and villages in the gaza strip 
underground leaders called the oneday strike in a leaflet 
signed by the palestine liberation organization to mark the end of 
mourning for khalil wazir the plo military commander 40 days 
after he was assassinated at his home in tunis 
wazir whose code name was abu jihad spent his boyhood in gaza 
city his cousin ahmed wazir who lives there said soldiers barred 
mourners from attending a reception in the slain leaders honor 
the army is outside our house ahmed wazir said by telephone 
from his home where the reception was to have been held they 
turned back anyone who came here 
he said 10 army jeeps and other military vehicles were outside 
his house and soldiers with megaphones ordered all residents on his 
street to remain indoors 
stores were closed throughout the territories and in arab east 
jerusalem which israel took from jordan in 1967 and has formally 
annexed public transport was halted and most palestinians who have 
jobs in israel stayed home 
vendors selling newspapers and doughnutshaped bread covered 
with sesame seeds an arab staple provided the only signs of 
commercial activity 
classes were conducted at kindergartens and elementary schools 
in the west bank which were allowed to open monday for the first 
time in nearly four months 
olivier rafovicz spokesman for the military government said 
about 90 percent of the 200000 students showed up wednesday 
this shows the strengthening of the military government he 
said 
in the leaflet that called the strike however underground 
leaders said the school reopening was a victory and urged children 
to attend 
israel radio said the army threatened arab property owners with 
up to five years in jail if they failed to wash antiisraeli 
graffiti off their buildings and remove palestinian flags which 
are outlawed by israel 
army spokesmen had no immediate comment on the report which 
also said those who did not comply could be fined 15000 shekels 
9670 
a jewish settler was charged with manslaughter wednesday in the 
fatal shooting of a palestinian shepherd may 5 near shiloh a 
jewish settlement in the west bank israel radio reported 
it quoted the charge sheet yisrael zeev fired at arab shepherds 
despite their shouts that they would stop grazing sheep on disputed 
land near shiloh the radio said one shepherd was killed and 
another wounded 
government prosecutors also charged two editors of the leftwing 
newspaper derech hanitzotz with membership in a guerrilla 
organization and maintaining contacts with a foreign agent the 
radio said 
yaacov ben efrat and assaf adiv and two other staff members 
charged earlier this week face up to 40 years in jail if 
convicted they are accused of belonging to the democratic front 
for the liberation of palestine a radical plo faction and meeting 
with arab guerrillas in london

the former conrail engineer at the controls 
during the worst crash in amtrak history pleaded guilty today to a 
federal charge of conspiring to obstruct an investigation of the 
wreck 
rick gates 34 already is serving a fiveyear prison sentence 
after pleading guilty to a state charge of manslaughter for running 
a string of locomotives past a signal and into the path of an 
amtrak passenger train 
sixteen people were killed and 175 were injured in the jan 4 
1987 crash near chase md 
gates could receive up to five years in prison and a 250000 
fine at sentencing july 15 
gates public defender fred warren bennett called the federal 
charges morally unjust gates was indicted march 31 two days 
after pleading guilty to the state charges 
it amounts to kicking the dog when hes down bennett told 
us district judge norman ramsey 
in exchange for his guilty plea to conspiracy charges of 
obstruction and making false statements were dropped under the 
plea bargain bennett said prosecutors will recommend a fiveyear 
sentence to be served after gates state term 
gates was accused of lying to national transportation safety 
board investigators in denying that he and brakeman edward cromwell 
had smoked marijuana while operating the train 
the federal indictment also accused gates of lying about having 
tested cab signals to make sure they were in working order 
cromwell received state and federal immunity for his cooperation in 
the investigation 
the crash prompted the introduction of federal legislation to 
tighten regulation of train crews 
the legislation passed by the house on monday would require 
train licenses for engineers make it illegal for crews to tamper 
with safety devices and give the government more clout in handling 
safety violations 
the senate is expected to approve the legislation this week as 
well 
gates in state court admitted he failed to replace a cab 
warning light bulb and fix a whistle that was taped over to keep it 
from sounding either warning device would have alerted him to the 
stop signals officials said

economist john kenneth galbraith says he and a 
soviet counterpart in collaborating on a new book found that both 
their countries are experiencing what they call superpower syndrome 
galbraith and soviet economist stanislav menshikov who have 
known each other for more than 20 years wanted to find out whether 
each could write fairly about the others economic system 
galbraith said 
under a joint publication agreement the book capitalism 
communism and coexistence from the bitter past to a better 
prospect is being released in both the united states and the 
soviet union 
today galbraith said there are many similarities between the 
united states and the soviet union and the book offers hope that 
both sides can work together 
one of those similarities he said is the superpower 
syndrome 
both powers the united states in vietnam and the soviet union 
in afghanistan have recently collided with the determination of 
other peoples everywhere to conduct their own governments and run 
their own lives he said 
galbraith 79 and menshikov 61 were in chicago on wednesday 
to discuss the book at an awards breakfast sponsored by clergy and 
laity concerned an interfaith group 
the book is compiled from discussions galbraith and menshikov 
conducted at galbraiths summer home in vermont 
we wanted to see whether we could write a book that dealt 
fairly and squarely with the problems of the two systems 
galbraith said tuesday night in a telephone interview from his 
hotel 
galbraith said the topics of the discussions include past 
achievements of socialism and capitalism the current problems of 
both systems and suggested reforms for those problems 
galbraith a native of canada has taught at harvard and 
princeton universities and is the author of more than 20 books on 
economics and other subjects he has also held a number of 
governmental posts including that of ambassador to india from 
196163 
menshikov is staff editor of the world marxist review published 
in prague czechoslovakia and author of a number of books 
including an economic comparison of the united states the soviet 
union and japan

thousands of hindu migrant workers are 
fleeing punjab following attacks by sikh extremists who are waging 
a war of terror in their quest for a separate homeland 
police say 65 migrant laborers have been killed by sikh gunmen 
in the past week 
even if i have to die at this age i must die among my 
relatives said piara ram 26 who was leaving for his home in 
uttar pradesh state there would be someone to cry for me 
the migrant workers departure could seriously undermine 
punjabs economy 
the punjab labor department estimates the state employs about 
700000 migrant workers a year most for planting and harvesting in 
the nations richest agricultural state 
several sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said about 
onethird have left since the sikh extremists raids escalated 
earlier this month the state government acknowledges laborers have 
returned home but gives no figures 
construction work has nearly stopped on a major canal designed 
to carry punjab river water to neighboring states and even migrant 
rickshaw pullers and other manual laborers are leaving 
although radical sikhs have frequently attacked hindus in their 
sixyear struggle for greater autonomy or an independent nation in 
punjab they started singling out hindu migrnt laborers during the 
police siege of the golden temple the 10day siege aimed at 
driving armed sikhs out of the shrine ended may 18 after more than 
200 sikh extremists and their supporters surrendered 
although punjab officials have pledged to protect the migrants 
who come mainly from the poor northern states of bihar orissa and 
uttar pradesh many say they are returning home rather than face 
more terrorism by sikh extremists 
police say the attacks may have a dual purpose to reduce the 
number of hindus in punjab and to undermine the states economy 
the attacks began may 17 when 31 men and women working on the 
sutlejyamuna link canal were shot to death by sikhs at their camp 
near majjat 30 miles northwest of the state capital at chandigarh 
the gunmen then burned the bodies 
seventy other camp workers fled to nearby fields and hid from 
the gunmen a day later they begged the government to arrange for 
their return to bihar and orissa states 
the attack was claimed by the khalistan commando force one of 
the largest of a dozen sikh extremist groups active in punjab in a 
note left with the bodies the group said it avenging the siege of 
the golden temple and threatened more reprisals 
the charred bodies of the 31 laborers remain in the deserted 
campsite and bloodstains still can be seen on the muddy footpaths 
leading to their tents 
the canal project they were working on has lost almost 7500 of 
its 10000 workers according to figures provided by the canal 
headquarters at chandigarh 
the sikh militants and some sikh moderates oppose the canal 
because it is designed to carry water from punjab to the 
neighboring states of haryana and rajasthan the militants contend 
it will reduce the water available for irrigation in punjab a 
breadbasket state of wheat fields rice paddies and sugar cane 
plantations 
romesh kumar sharma a contractor on two bridges being built 
along the canal said work was all but stopped on the canal and 
could not be resumed unless the migrants were lured back to the 
project 
the average migrant worker in punjab earns betweeen 38 and 46 
per month most send money home to support their families jobs in 
their native states are hard to find and pay much less 
lubhaya a rickshaw puller worked for seven years in ludhiana 
the district capital but was at the railway station this week 
waiting for a train he said he was leaving the death land of 
punjab for good 
ram kumar sharma owner of a brick kiln in ropar district just 
north of chandigarh said many of his 35 migrant employees have 
left chaman lal another kiln owner estimated that twothirds of 
the districts 1700 migrant kiln workers have fled 
an official at the states home ministry which is responsible 
for internal security said special camps would be set up for 
migrants to make them feel more secure 
in ropar district deputy commissioner jr kundal said security 
would be provided for the canal workers camps and he urged 
laborers to stay 
if you dont work here what will you or your family members 
eat he asked them he did not say when the security would be 
provided

rising production costs and cutbacks in 
federal payments are keeping up the pressure on farmers this year 
says a new outlook report by the agriculture department 
net cash income of farmers is forecast at 50 billion to 55 
billion this year down from the record of 57 billion in 1987 the 
report released tuesday said that is unchanged from usdas 
previous forecasts 
the departments economic research service added that underlying 
the forecast are improvements in several of agricultures key 
fundamentals 
use of most of the major commodities has increased thereby 
reducing burdensome stockpiles 
market prices for those commodities are approaching or are 
higher the governments support levels 
higher cattle prices have offset minor declines in production 
interest rates have continued to be moderate 
total farm debt is declining for the fifth consecutive year 
indicating further gains in the financial position of operators 
production expenses are expected to rise after declining at 
an unprecedented rate the last three years the report said 
spring fertilizer prices were up 10 percent from a year ago and 
those will be felt most by corn and barley producers whose 
outlays for fertilizer make up 38 percent and 30 percent 
respectively of variable costs the report said the corn belt 
will be the region most affected 
energy expenses may rise about 5 percent this year with cash 
grain and cattle and hog operations accounting for more than 60 
percent of fuel costs last year again the corn belt will be most 
affected 
thus the drop in 1988 net cash income the difference between 
gross cash income and cash expenses will be mostly due to higher 
cash expenses outweighing greater cash receipts from the sale of 
crops and livestock 
further the report said direct payments to farmers in 1988 are 
expected to drop by as much as 20 percent from last years 17 
billion 
despite the dip in cash income this year analysts said the 
balance sheet of us agriculture continues to show improvement 
from the hardpressed economy of a few years ago 
with improving income lower debt and adequate credit for farm 
real estate loans buyers are coming back into the real estate 
market the report said with recent improvements in cash flow 
many land sales have been for cash

the agriculture department has hired a new 
administrator for the agricultural research service under an 
arrangement that gives him an annual benefits package worth 
126500 a year at taxpayer expense 
ronald d plowman 59 is leaving his job as head of the 
department of animal dairy and veterinary sciences at utah state 
university to take over the agricultural research service or ars 
at a salary of 77500 agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
announced the appointment on april 15 
but that is only part of the story says ed curran a retired 
usda editor who writes a twicemonthly newsletter that often 
includes gadfly accounts of department goingson 
curran disclosed in his latest issue that plowman will continue 
to draw a federal pension of about 35000 a year earned in 27 
years on the job with ars from 1956 to 1984 when he retired and 
went to work for utah state 
the plowman job package involves an ipa maneuver provided by 
the federal intergovernmental personnel act which allows state 
governments to get the loan of federal experts or send their 
employees to washington on a shortterm basis 
in this particular case confirmed tuesday by agency officials 
plowman technically will be on loan from the university which will 
pay his salary while in washington the usda in turn will 
reimburse the university 77500 a year 
plowman also will get 14000 a year in federal per diem to help 
pay moving expenses and make up for higher living costs in the 
washington area 
normally plowman would give up his federal retirement income 
while returning to work at the usda agency but under the ipa 
arrangement plowman will be able keep his pension income although 
the loan deal with utah state is for a year officials said the 
contract is renewable on the same terms 
thus plowmans prospective income of 126500 a year is 
substantially more than lyngs pay of 99500 or members of 
congress who get 89500 a year 
if plowman converts over to federal employment severing his 
connection with utah state he automatically would be cut off from 
his old pension benefits at least until he retires again from 
federal service

rains last month brought temporary relief to 
many parched areas of the west where the outlook for this summers 
water supply had been poor says the agriculture department

see an increase in rainfall wilson scaling chief of the 
departments soil conservation service said tuesday were 
hoping this change will develop into a longterm pattern 
scaling said precipitation in april was near to above normal in 
most areas west of the rocky mountains the columbia basin got 
abovenormal precipitation and arizona received twice its april 
average 
reservoir storage is very good in the colorado and rio grande 
basins he said we also expect reservoirs in arizona and new 
mexico to fill 
but scaling said the water supply outlook in other areas is not 
nearly so bright 
some areas in montana will be facing water supply shortages as 
early as next month he said there are also sections of 
california nevada oregon idaho and washington that remain very 
dry despite the recent increase in precipitation 
scaling added its going to take a lot more than just one 
good month of precipitation to ease the drought in those areas

israel will send diplomats to moscow to take up 
consular duties for the first time in 21 years a foreign ministry 
official said wednesday 
another ministry official told israel army radio he hoped the 
agreement between the two countries would eventually lead to full 
diplomatic ties the official political adviser nimrod novick 
declined to describe the pact as a breakthrough in sovietisraeli 
relations 
what we are talking about is dipping ourselves in the water to 
check if it is hot or cold he said it remains to be seen when 
our delegates reach moscow how well they will be received 
the soviets agreed to issue visas to the israeli diplomats 
during a secret meeting monday in zurich switzerland novick told 
the station 
the other ministry source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said diplomats from the jewish state could leave for the soviet 
capital as early as next week 
the soviet union broke ties with israel when the jewish state 
captured the occupied west bank gaza strip and golan heights from 
the kremlins arab allies in the 1967 middle east war 
this weeks agreement came 10 months after soviet consular 
officials began operating from the finnish embassy in tel aviv 
novick who negotiated for the visas said the soviets resisted 
israeli efforts to have the diplomats handle visas to israel for 
soviet jewish emigres it looked like it was broadening things to 
the soviets he said 
but he added that the soviets agreed not to restrict other 
contacts between the israelis and soviet jews 
israels diplomats will administer an embassy building that has 
been vacant since 1967 but for which israel has continued to pay 
monthly rent novick said 
the diplomats up to six in number will work from the dutch 
embassy where visas for jewish emigres are processed according to 
sources quoted by israeli media 
the agreement followed two months of secret contacts with 
vladimir terrasov deputy head of the soviet foreign ministrys 
middle east department novick said 
in the past two years kremlin leaders have improved ties with 
israel to try to gain a role in peace efforts in the middle east 
that led to the agreement nearly a year ago for the eightmember 
consular team to come to israel

the dispatch union city nj on reagan administration and 
noriega 
the reagan administration reportedly has offered to dismiss 
15 indictments brought against gen manuel antonio noriega by 
grand juries in miami and tampa fla if he will resign as 
panamas military commander and leave the country until after 
the 1990 presidential elections 
somebody must be kidding 
noriega is accused of taking 46 million in payoffs from 
colombias violent medellin cartel to protect cocaine shipments 
launder money supply drug laboratories and shelter the gangs 
leaders from law enforcement 
why should it bother him to go into exile until 1990 he 
will simply leave his corrupt cronies in place to keep the drugs 
and money flowing while he serves his time in some pleasure spot 
president reagans war against drugs has been anything but 
successful and dismissing the indictments would indicate the united 
states condones drug trafficking

providence ri journalbulletin on the addictiveness of 
smoking 
on the surface the essence of the us surgeon generals annual 
report on smoking that nicotine is potently addictive is 
nothing new anyone who has ever smoked regularly then tried to 
stop knows painfully well the hold nicotine has on people 
yet this years report equates the addiction of nicotine to that 
of heroin and cocaine and in the process raises some eyebrows 
can it really be as difficult to give up smoking as it is to 
stop shooting up with heroin 
with such a comparison isnt there a danger that now smokers 
will begin to be equated with drug users and perhaps shunned by 
employers when their functioning under the influence of nicotine 
has no relation to ones functioning under that say of heroin 
adults who choose to indulge their habit ought to be free to 
do so except in outlawed premises for in their cases they are the 
only ones affected

alamogordo nm daily news on a proposal to legalize drugs 
election year posturing drives politicians antidrug rhetoric 
to hysteria levels some very extreme and absurd ideas have gained 
unwarranted respectability 
chief among these is the notion that legalizing heroin cocaine 
and other addictive substances will alleviate americas alarming 
drug problem 
the logic behind this proposal is identical to giving a drunk 
another drink to cure his alcoholism 
making illicit narcotics legal and thus cheaper and even more 
readily available would not discourage drug abuse 
on the contrary legalization would cause consumption to soar 
and magnify to a dangerous degree the full range of personal and 
societal destruction caused by drug use

baltimore sun on apartheid 
the newest debate over economic sanctions against south africa 
raises familiar questions about the effectiveness of sanctions and 
the impact on the people they are designed to help 
it also raises anew the issue of where the united states should 
stand in the battle over apartheid the racist system upheld by the 
whiteminority government in pretoria 
two sweeping sanctions bills have been introduced in congress 
both would bar most us trade with south africa and require 
american firms to withdraw their investments 
the new sanctions would be much stronger but if the united 
states is alone in imposing them legitimate questions can still be 
raised about their effectiveness against a determined pretoria 
government and eager investors from other countries 
it also is fair to ask how the sanctions would affect blacks 
since their victimization by the apartheid regime is the source of 
us concerns

the san luis obispo calif telegramtribune on removing 
noriega 
the reagan administration has made a mess of its attempts to 
oust gen manuel antonio noriega panamas drugdealing dictator 
each day seems to bring a new proposal the latest being that if 
noriega steps down his handpicked president could remain in 
office until elections are held next year 
that makes even less sense than a white house offer to drop the 
drug charges against noriega if hell get out of office and 
eventually out of the country entirely 
sol linowitz former ambassador to the organization of american 
states and perhaps the most respected us observer of latin 
american affairs proposes that the reagan administration practice 
mediation rather than muscle 
lets enlist the help of neighboring latin states in trying to 
talk sense to noriega says linowitz 
noriega is not likely to leave in the face of the bully tactics 
that have been tried by the white house also the sanctions have 
hurt the panamanian people more than their selfstyled leader 
stirring bitterness against the united states 
getting him to take a walk will require a bunch of carrots 
rather than a bundle of sticks

vice president george bush finally stepped outside the shadow of 
president reagan however slightly on the issue of panamanian gen 
manuel noriega and drugs 
that should encourage supporters who have watched bush continue 
to sink in the polls the latest gallup poll has massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis leading bush nationally by 54 to 38 percent 
pollsters also are finding out that voters believe the democrats 
are handling the drug issue better than the republicans 
so bush said recently that as president i wont bargain with 
drug dealers whether theyre on us or foreign soil 
he said the antidrug effort he has spearheaded wasnt enough 
and he outlined a program in which the vice president would be the 
drug czar in a bush administration 
its time that george bush stop hiding behind the cloak of his 
loyalty to president reagan and establish his own identity

the bellingham wash herald on the supreme court decision on 
trash 
the us supreme court was too cavalier with individual rights 
when it ruled police are free to search through barrels and bags 
people leave out for trash collection 
the decision made in regard to a 1984 narcotics case in laguna 
beach calif allows police to search through garbage without a 
warrant and without any reason to suspect criminal activity 
it is disturbing that a majority on the supreme court believes 
most americans wouldnt object to police picking through their 
trash without a warrant on a fishing expedition for evidence that 
might implicate them in a crime 
the fourth amendment of the constitution reads the right of 
the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and 
effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be 
violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause 
supported by oath and affirmation and particularly describing the 
place to be searched and the persons or things to be searched 
does a majority on the supreme court believe most americans do 
not consider their trash as part of their effects

the commercial appeal memphis tenn on congressional 
appropriations 
members of congress hoping to dip into the congressional pork 
barrel this year for new water and energy projects will find 
themselves on a welldeserved starvation diet if the house 
appropriations committee has its way 
the committee decreed for the first time in the memory of those 
who serve on it that no money will be appropriated for the next 
fiscal year to start construction of new water or energy projects 
it isnt that the committee has suddenly become allergic to 
pork its just that committee members felt constrained to 
honor a twoyear agreement reached at last decembers white 
housecongress budget summit to keep costs down to reduce the 
federal deficit 
but this being an election year few politicians are eager to 
endorse increased taxes even to satisfy the desires of house and 
senate members who gain bragging rights for federally funded 
projects that benefit their districts and states 
its gratifying that however brief and limited it may be the 
house appropriations committee decided to give taxpayers a break 
from higher porkbarrel spending

portland maine press herald on george bush 
last week george bush began the task of cutting the apron 
strings 
although the reagan administration is apparently willing to drop 
drug trafficking charges against panama strongman manuel noriega if 
hell relinquish power bush has declared he would never negotiate 
with drug dealers 
the conflict doesnt bother the president white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater says the president takes no offense adding that 
i expect a number of them bushs positions will be different 
than existing policies during the campaign 
there are other good reasons for bush to stop masquerading as 
son of reagan 
first its not all positive reagans refusal to fire attorney 
general edwin meese iii is a millstone around bushs neck so are 
charges that the reagan administration had links with noriega 
beyond that however although hes been in government for 
decades bush has never articulated clearly where he stands in 
terms of political philosophy hes drifted from one administration 
to another his beliefs often shifting with political winds 
cutting loose from reasgan provides bush with the opportunity to 
develop his own clear agenda in a postreagan presidency and hes 
got to if he is to have any hope of succeeding the boss

the augusta ga chronicle on michael dukakis 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis says he wants 
to end reaganomics 
but wait a minute america is in its 66th straight month of the 
longest and strongest recovery in us peacetime history 
the economy is still creating jobs at a 3 million annual rate 
through the first four months for a record 156 million since the 
recovery began in december 1982 
incidentally according to economist warren brookes over the 
past year 63 percent of new jobs were professional and 
managerial and only 1 percent were in service occupations 
thus finally silencing all the yammering about hamburger 
flippers 
democrats are trying to claim that inflation looms as the nation 
moves closer to full employment the policies of the federal 
reserve board of course will determine if this could become a 
serious problem 
but brookes reminds us of some recent history in the last seven 
years as the jobless rate has fallen two points 28 percent 
inflation as measured by the gross national product deflator has 
also fallen by more than 7 points 75 percent 
vice president bush needs to tell voters about it the liberal

milwaukee wis sentinel on the drug war 
the wages of sin can be an effective weapon in the war against 
crime but less so in wisconsin 
thats because money or property seized from criminals in drug 
raids isnt kept by state or local law enforcement agencies for use 
in future drug buys but is turned over to the state school fund 
as a result and because the state civil forfeiture proceeding 
takes longer than the federal procedure local prosecutors often 
involve federal authorities in the cases 
after custody of money has been obtained by federal officials 
they return the cash to local authorities keeping 10 percent to 20 
percent for administrative costs 
that 10 percent to 20 percent could be used here in wisconsin if 
state law was changed to speed things up and to allow local 
agencies to keep the loot they seize the loss to the school fund 
probably would be negligible considering that local authorities 
now use the federal option anyway 
far from negligible would be the gain if that money helped 
capture another drug trafficker

the reagan administration will begin 
purchasing nicaraguan currency this week for distribution to the 
contra rebels to buy food and clothing despite a plea from house 
democrats to drop the idea a spokesman for the aid program said 
wednesday 
the democrats met in a closeddoor caucus wednesday and voted to 
approve a resolution calling for the cash aid program to be 
scuttled and for food and clothing to be shipped through the 
panamerican development foundation or padf an agency with ties 
to the organization of american states 
both the contras and nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
have made public statements accepting the padf as the delivery 
agent for a 177 million humanitarian aid program approved by 
congress earlier this year 
but a spokesman for the agency for international development 
which is administering the aid said there had been no formal 
request from the two sides to establish padf as delivery agent and 
that the congressional request was premature 
there has to be a formal agreement in place said spokesman 
roger noriega we have said all along that the neutral delivery 
mechanism has to be part of an agreement between the resistance and 
the sandinista government 
noriega added it is wholly unrealistic to expect aid to talk 
with the padf in specific terms until there is a signed agreement 
or some kind of reliable public statement 
aid plans to begin purchasing cordobas the nicaraguan currency 
this week for distribution to rebel troops in the field as early as 
next week noriega added troops will receive about 1 a day each 
he said 
the first purchases will be this week then youll see the 
first movement across the border next week he said adding that 
the money is to be channeled through the contra military structure 
noriega said it is the rainy season in nicaragua and that 
scheduling of airdrops is unreliable so that cash aid may have to 
continue even after a neutral delivery agent as called for in 
the legislation is established 
the resolution approved by house democrats contended that the 
reagan administration is violating the ceasefire agreement and 
the us ceasefire assistance program by providing cash sending 
aid without inspection by the verification commission and by using 
a delivery contractor that does not meet the test of neutrality 
aid continues to use a delivery company circle gthat has past 
links to the cia the caucus noted 
the resolution called on the administration to make immediate 
arrangements for delivery of aid through the panamerican 
development foundation 
noriega said aid has so far delivered 600 metric tons of food 
clothing and other supplies to rebel forces inside honduras through 
private contractors 
the loads delivered so far have been inspected by 
representatives of the roman catholic church in honduras to make 
sure they contain no lethal supplies noriega said most of the 
deliveries have been made by truck although there have been about 
a dozen airdrops he said

thives struck museums in two 
cities in the days following the biggest art theft in dutch 
history officials said wednesday 
on sunday thieves at amsterdams biblical museum forced open a 
glass showcase and stole six antique egyptian statuettes according 
to the rotterdam newspaper nrc handelsblad 
the bronze and clay figures worth an estimated 7800 to 
10400 apparently were stolen while the museum was open the 
report said 
the theft came two days after thieves broke into amsterdams 
municipal museum and stole three paintings estimated at up to 52 
million including works by vincent van gogh and paul cezanne the 
theft highlighted the relatively low security at the museum which 
houses 3000 mainly modern masterworks but has no night guard 
the burglary triggered an electronic alarm but it took up to 20 
minutes for police and security officials to arrive on the scene 
later that day thieves smashed a showcase and stole two jewelry 
items in the dutch literary museum in the hague according to 
museum director anton korteweg 
the stolen cameo brooch and a goldedged medallion were worth 
several thousand dollars korteweg told the associated press 
adding the incident at his museum also occurred while it was open 
to the public 
the literary museum housed in the ultramodern royal library 
complex has electronic surveillance and a night guard and owns a 
collection of manuscripts books and other objects associated with 
dutch literary figures 
the biblical museum which has a collection of artifacts from 
the holy land had only one guard on duty at the time of the theft 
the newspaper said

soviet economists said wednesday they have seen 
the future and it holds family farms thriving foreign trade and 
rubles acceptable on world markets one predicted however that 
the future is not near at hand 
nikolai l shmelev told reporters his liberal ideas encounter 
opposition that makes him feel like a minority of one 
he predicted the ubiquitous symbols of the soviet unions 
economic ills long lines or lists for consumer goods would be 
around for a long time shmelev said it would take at least 10 
years to catch up with the demand for cars 
another economist oleg t bogomolov said all of us are 
suffering particularly our wives who do most of the shopping 
bogomolov was more optimistic he said lines should become a 
memory in five or six years as cooperatives a form of limited 
private enterprise soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev favors help 
meet consumer demand 
shmelev who is with the soviet institute of the usa and 
canada has published articles in the literary journal novy mir 
advocating reforms far more radical than gorbachevs 
he mentioned two at the news conference wednesday selling some 
of the soviet unions vast gold reserves for foreign currency to 
buy consumer goods made abroad and letting farm families lease 
land from the state 
the economist conceded his proposals had received only lukewarm 
support 
at times i find myself in this situation a minority of one 
shmelev said these questions can be discussed but these are not 
yet practical issues 
shmelev has been particularly critical of collectivized 
agriculture he said the country is moving toward increasing the 
number of familyrun farms because of excessive bureaucracy in 
collective operations 
the future belongs to family farms he said but he does not 
envision turning the land over to private ownership 
articles have appeared in the official press about agricultural 
experiments in which farm families own buildings equipment and 
animals and have longterm leases on land in collectives members 
of a cooperative own buildings and machinery jointly and share in 
the earnings 
gorbachev wants to improve the collective farm in its various 
forms including the idea of smaller work teams that would include 
the family 
making the ruble a convertible currency that could be traded 
freely has been debated vigorously in the official press some 
economists say it would lead to serious inflation problems because 
of fluctuations against other currenciews 
lack of convertibility hampers foreign trade foreign companies 
are not eager to earn rubles which they cannot use outside the 
soviet union 
in order to buy the western technology and products it needs 
the soviet union must sell its own goods abroad for acceptable 
foreign currency 
ivan d ivanov first deputy chairman of the foreign economic 
commission sounded confident that the change would come we want 
to be sure our ruble becomes a hard currency he said 
ivanov said the ruble should become convertible by the 
mid1990s first in the soviet bloc and later elsewhere in the 
world but prices of soviet goods first will have to be brought 
into line with world markets 
another kremlin goal is at least a doubling of foreign trade by 
the end of the century he said the volume of soviet foreign trade 
with developed capitalist countries was 20 billion rubles about 
33 billion at the official rate in the first three quarters of 
1987

the missing 100 bill that led to a strip 
search of high school students and the demotion of the official who 
ordered the search was found tucked in a closet of the room where 
it vanished last month 
martin county high school officials dont know how or when the 
money ended up in john parsons classroom the bill was still 
tucked inside a coin purse 
its been very painful principal wanda yarboro said 
tuesday after all weve been through we just want to put it 
behind us 
she said it appears the coin purse was taken and later stuffed 
into a closet 
it definitely was not misplaced yarboro said but im not 
going to draw any conclusion because i dont know all we wanted 
was for the money to be found it just happened a month too late 
deneen deshields 18 reported the money missing during parsons 
cooking class last month 
a student looking for grill cleaner during a yearly inventory 
found the money tuesday in the rarely used closet parson said 
it could have been there all along i dont know he said 
miss deshields had brought the money to school april 11 to pay 
for a trip to texas with the schools choral group when she 
reported it missing and a search didnt find her coin purse the 
16 juniors and seniors in the class were locked in the room 
dean of students michael lindgren and security personnel 
separated the students by sex and searched them assistant 
principal jc williams helped in the search which infuriated 
parents 
the martin county school board earlier this month demoted 
lindgren to a teacher and suspended williams for five days 
lindgren was pleased that the money turned up 
thats all i ever wanted he said

the little league boosters club is out 
its 37000 savings account and its treasurer whos suspected of 
taking the money 
club president ernie shultz said the apparent theft came to 
light earlier this month when some of the clubs checks bounced 
treasurer bobbi sanor was asked to attend a meeting but didnt turn 
up he said 
police chief harry montgomery said ms sanor has not been seen 
in town since the first week in may an arrest warrant has been 
issued charging ms sanor with embezzlement 
when we called the meeting and told her we wanted to see the 
books she said no problem then we met and she was gone and 
shed taken her son out of school too shultz said 
shultz said the club which sponsors football basketball and 
cheerleading programs that last year involved about 200 youngsters 
is faced with 20000 in unpaid bills 
shultz said ms sanor was the clubs treasurer in 1986 without 
any problems she worked real hard i guess thats what stumped 
everybody he said when you get somebody for volunteer work 
who works that hard you dont push them too much you know but 
well be more careful in the future 
he said the club is going to become bonded and require two 
signatures on all checks 
he said the club will try to have fundraisers and hope people 
will give us money to pull through this thats about all we can do 
right now

the partial deregulation of the trucking 
industry has saved the economy tens of billions of dollars a year 
while having little effect on safety or service to small 
communities a staff report by the federal trade commission 
concluded wednesday 
ftc chairman daniel oliver cited the report in calling for the 
removal of remaining federal and state economic restrictions on the 
commercial trucking industry his views were endorsed by heather 
gradison chairman of the interstate commerce commission 
according to the ftc staff study between 39 billion and 63 
billion are being saved annually because of increased competition 
and efficiencies flowing from the partial deregulation of the 
trucking industry eight years ago 
the best available estimates suggest that the gains have 
outweighed the losses by approximately 20 to 1 concluded the 
report released by the ftcs bureau of economics the commission 
has not formally endorsed the findings 
the motor carrier act of 1980 greatly eased entry into the 
trucking business by making it easier for a trucking company to 
begin operating along a particular route in recent years 
applications for a route have been denied only rarely it also has 
become easier for carriers to set their own rates 
the ftc staff report by economist diane owen said the easing of 
government control over the trucking industry has resulted in new 
shipping services and greater scheduling and pricing flexibility 
leading to increased savings and allowing shippers to better 
compete with foreign companies 
ms owen acknowledged that there have been concerns about 
deregulation on some trucking companies as well as about truck 
safety and a possible decline in services to small and rural 
communities 
the report said that despite these concerns trucking services to 
small communities generally have improved or remained unchanged 
deregulation does not appear to have adversely affected safety 
and while many trucking companies have gone out of business the 
overall number of companies and employees in the industry has 
increased 
the report said that while interstate commerce has benefited 
from deregulation continued state regulation costs consumers and 
the economy billions of dollars annually 
oliver called for additional action removing the yoke of 
unnecessary economic regulation that still exists of the trucking 
industry the transportation department has sought further 
deregulation of trucking but congress so far has not taken action 
meanwhile oliver said states should eliminate many of their 
retrictions on commercial trucking 
in california it now costs more to ship goods from oakland to 
san francisco a distance of 15 miles than to ship interstate from 
reno to san francisco oliver said

president reagan says he may hold 
another summit with mikhail s gorbachev yet this year to finish 
work on a treaty to reduce longrange nuclear missiles according 
to a published report 
in an interview with the die welt newspaper published in its 
thursday editions reagan also said he wants his nato partners to 
pay more of the alliances expenses 
the interview was conducted in washington before reagan left for 
moscow and his fourth summit with gorbachev 
president reagan figures that the start treaty which foresees 
the halving of nuclear intercontinental missiles still can be 
brought to completion before the end of his term the 
conservative daily said 
advance copies of the report were provided to other media 
wednesday the germanlanguage excerpts were translated into 
english by the associated press 
die welt said reagan told the journalists that the soviets are 
interested in concluding an intercontinental ballistic missile 
treaty with him rather than waiting until his successor takes over 
in january 
therefore the president doesnt exclude the possibility of a 
fifth summit conference with gorbachev this year on neutral 
ground the newspaper said 
reagan who left washington for finland on wednesday en route to 
moscow met with gorbachev in geneva in november 1985 in 
reykjavik iceland in october 1986 and in washington in december 
1987 
during the interview die welt said reagan was asked how he gets 
along with gorbachev 
we can discuss delicate issues without lingering on personal 
bad feelings i believe there is actually a certain degree of 
friendship between us die welt quoted reagan as saying 
the newspaper also said reagan touched on problems facing the 
americans in financing costs of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and urged that other nato partners share more of the 
burden 
i dont think this is an area that should cause bad blood 
between us die welt quoted reagan as saying 
but it would be helpful if the allies would carry more of the 
load especially since the american congress for years has declined 
to approve further increases for defense the newspaper quoted 
the president as saying 
reagan told the reporters he is pleased that gorbachevs policy 
of glasnost or more openness in soviet society has influenced 
other east bloc countries 
die welt said reagan also made reference to last weekends 
communist party leadership change in hungary in which janos kadar 
who had led the party 32 years was replaced as premier by karoly 
grosz 
reagan said kadar had simply been in office too long die 
welt reported

asked what chance he saw for the signing of a start treaty at a 
fifth summit meeting with the soviets before he leaves office on 
jan 20 1989 reagan said i cant discount that i certainly 
dont want to say that it is impossible because i believe we can 
exclude signing a start treaty at this summit 
i believe however that negotiations in this summit will bring 
us further and i hope that it can be concluded while i am still in 
office he told the newspaper 
i also believe that the other side also thinks this way that 
unnecessary delay could be caused if they had to wait until my 
successor becomes familiar with the job and is in the position to 
work with them the soviets 
therefore i hope that we can clear up all remaining questions 
during my time in office then it can be that we decide to sign 
this treaty at a new meeting and not separated by thousands of 
miles 
since we have visited each other in our home countries we 
would probably decide on a neutral location for the signing 
reagan told the newspaper

sales of existing homes increased 45 percent 
in april the biggest advance in 17 months as buyers rushed to 
close deals before interest rates went up a real estate trade 
group said wednesday 
the national association of realtors said existing singlefamily 
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 348 
million units last month following increases of 25 percent in 
both february and march 
john tuccillo chief economist for the association predicted 
that sales would be slowed in the months ahead by rising mortgage 
rates 
rates for 30year fixedrate mortgages hit a low this year of 
984 percent on feb 12 and have been rising since then climbing 
to 1052 percent last week according to a survey by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp 
home prices edged down slightly in april with the median price 
of a home falling to 87700 while this was down 200 from the 
march median sales price it was still up from a year ago when the 
median price was 86000 
the slight marchtoapril decline in the median price masked 
wide regional differences home prices rose 53 percent in the 
northeast to 145100 the highest in the country prices were up a 
slight 04 percent in the midwest to a median of 67500 prices 
fell 46 percent in the west to 113700 and were down 14 percent 
in the south to 82100 
tuccillo said the slight overall decline in home prices was an 
indication that prices were finally leveling off and would increase 
only modestly for the remainder of the year 
the association is predicting that resales of existing homes 
will total 331 million this year down 6 percent from the 352 
million homes sold in 1987 
the overall april increase was led by a 62 percent increase in 
sales in the northeast which climbed to an annual rate of 690000 
units 
sales were up 57 percent in the south to an annual rate of 13 
million units while the midwest had a 23 percent increase in 
sales to an annual rate of 900000 
the west was the only region of the country to have a decline in 
sales a drop of 18 percent to an annual rate of 560000 units

two white policemen were 
convicted wednesday of murdering a black youth in what the judge 
described as a wanton beating expedition in a township 
warrant officer leon de villiers and constable david goosen 
could receive the death penalty they were expected to be sentenced 
later this week after arguments about extenuating circumstances 
it is believed that no white policeman has ever been executed 
for killing a black while on duty in the black townships 
the trial which began in october is one of the few in south 
african history in which white policemen have testified against 
colleagues facing the death penalty for alleged brutality against 
blacks 
justice nw zietsman who presided over the nonjury trial 
said de villiers had led his 10man allwhite unit into a black

a world war ii veteran accused of 
shooting his benefits counselor has been ordered to undergo 
treatment at a state hospital after being found incompetent to 
stand trial for murder officials said 
a jury ruled tuesday that rufus william smith 63 of stonewall 
was incompetent to stand trial on charges that he killed john 
walker pettit 54 
state district judge v murray jordan ordered smith committed to 
vernon state hospital smith had been in the kerr county jail in 
lieu of 250000 bond in the slaying jan 20 
jurors heard two days of testimony before deciding that the 
former marine was incompetent to stand trial now and that there 
is no substantial probability that he will attain competency in the 
foreseeable future 
pettit was a veterans affairs counselor for the texas veterans 
commission who was handling smiths claims 
district attorney ron sutton said smith was enraged by delays in 
his medical claims and shot pettit in the counselors office near 
the veterans administration hospital as pettits wife linda and 
other workers watched 
testimony monday indicated smith believed that va officials had 
been keeping duplicate files on him 
smith claimed officials removed information from his records 
that showed he killed japanese soldiers during world war ii he 
believed the lack of that information was keeping him from getting 
full disability payments sutton said 
smith who had undergone treatment at the va hospital had 
sought full medical disability instead of the partial claims he was 
being awarded 
dr robert g harper of the baylor college of medicine in 
houston testified that he examined smith in 1982 and diagnosed him 
as a paranoid schizophrenic who believed pettit was the source of 
his troubles 
smiths attorney scott stehling of kerrville said smiths 
family wanted him to receive treatment

a former conrail engineer already serving a 
fiveyear state prison sentence pleaded guilty wednesday to a 
federal charge of conspiring to obstruct the investigation of the 
worst crash in amtrak history 
in exchange federal prosecutors dropped three other charges 
against rick l gates 
gates 33 was sentenced almost two months ago after he pleaded 
guilty to a state misdemeanor charge of manslaughter by locomotive 
for running a string of conrail locomotives past a signal and into 
the path of an amtrak passenger train 
the jan 4 1987 crash near chase killed 16 people and injured 
175 others 
former conrail brakeman edward cromwell with whom authorities 
say gates conspired received state and federal immunity for his 
cooperation in the investigation 
in the plea agreement assistant us attorney gregg bernstein 
recommended that gates be sentenced to a fiveyear prison term to 
be served consecutively with his state sentence the maximum 
penalty on the conspiracy charge is five years and a 250000 fine 
sentencing is scheduled july 15 
the charges which were dropped included obstruction of justice 
and two counts of making false statements 
in the statement of facts the prosecutor read into the record 
wednesday gates admitted lying on jan 7 1987 to national 
transportation safety board investigators about sharing a marijuana 
cigarette with cromwell 
the statement also said gates lied about having tested cab 
signals to ensure they were in working order and lied about 
observing and calling out signals along the route including a 
signal telling the train to slow down and stop after he smoked the 
marijuana cigarette 
gates public defender fred warren bennett told us district 
judge norman ramsey that the federal government shouldnt have 
brought the charges 
bennett said the government waited until gates pleaded guilty to 
the state charges including an extensive statement of facts 
before filing its indictment 
it amounts to kicking the dog when hes down bennett said 
he literally gave a written confession to what would be federal 
charges 
bennett said in my judgment the federal prosecution smacks 
of both grandstanding and pandering to the public 
bernstein said after the hearing he would respond to bennetts 
accusations at sentencing but added i wonder whos doing the 
grandstanding 
gates was indicted by a federal grand jury march 31 two days 
after being sentenced and fined 1000 in baltimore county circuit 
court on the state charge

the united states assailed singapore on 
wednesday for continuing to allege that american diplomats are 
meddling in its domestic politics 
in spite of our denials the government of singapore continues 
to allege that us diplomats engaged in activities not in keeping 
with accepted international practice and interfered in singapores 
domestic affairs said state department spokesman charles redman 
the united states is not and has not been engaged in 
interference in singapores domestic affairs all activities of 
us government officials in dealing with singapore have been 
legitimate and in full accordance with customary diplomatic 
practice he added 
the dispute centers around allegations by singapore that 
american embassy officers met with singaporan lawyers and urged 
them to run against prime minister lee kuan yew who is expected to 
retain control of the island nations parliament in elections 
scheduled for next year 
the united states contends that its diplomats meet routinely 
with members of the constitutional opposition in other countries to 
keep abreast of political developments 
earlier this month singapore asked the united states to remove 
one of its embassy officers and the united states retaliated by 
asking for the ouster of a singaporan diplomat stationed in 
washington

iraqi forces drove the iranians from the 
marshes east of basra on wednesday dealing iran its third major 
military defeat in recent weeks 
an iraqi statement said the iranians were pushed across the 
border after 10 hours of fighting in an offensive called on god 
we depend 
iraq also said its warplanes made a longrange bombing raid on 
an important power plant near irans border with the soviet union 
iran initially claimed to have repelled the iraqi assault in the 
salamchah region which its revolutionary guards seized at great 
cost in january and february of last year 
several hours later the official islamic republic news agency 
announced following heavy clashes the moslem forces of iran 
had to retreat from parts of the area they had captured before the 
moslem forces are responding to heavy artillery fire 
it said iranian planes heavily bombed iraqi troop 
concentrations inflicting substantial losses in men and 
equipment 
an iraqi communique distributed by the official iraqi news 
agency said five iranian divisions were wiped out and survivors 
retreated across the frontier it did not give figures but an 
iranian division usually averages about 10000 men 
there was no way to confirm the iraqi casualty claim us 
military analysts estimate iran lost at least 25000 soldiers in 
last years battle for basra and about 10000 iraqis were killed 
conflicting reports seldom can be verified because neutral 
observers have been allowed into battle zones only rarely since the 
war began in september 1980 
loss of the bridgehead near basra would extend a string of 
iranian defeats that began when iraqs 7th army corps led by elite 
presidential guards pushed the iranians off the faw peninsula 
south of basra on april 1618 iran had held the marshy finger of 
land for two years 
also on april 18 the us navy destroyed two of irans offshore 
oil platforms in the persian gulf and sank or disabled six iranian 
naval craft in related confrontations 
those defeats combined with economic problems and political 
uncertainty within iran appear to have put ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis regime on the defensive after a long period of 
initiative in the ground war 
baghdad said the 3rd army corps again led by presidential 
guards moved before dawn to recapture the marshes around fish lake 
east of basra 
iraq created the artificial lake early in the war as a barrier 
to iranian invasion but revolutionary guards fought through 
several iraqi defense lines last year to take the wetlands 
a communique from iraq said its soldiers pushed across the 
jassim and duaiji rivers around fish lake on wednesday and the 
iranian invaders have been defeated and driven outside our 
international borders 
president saddam hussein personally supervised the 
offensive traveling to the battlefield with his defense 
minister gen adnan khairallah the communique said it did not 
elaborate 
baghdad radio interrupted regular programs to announce a great 
victory in an epic battle iraqi soldiers in the capital 
fired automatic weapons into the air to celebrate 
another iranian report said its army repelled an iraqi 
counterattack in the mountainous sulaimaniyeh region of northeast 
iraq where the iran seized territory several weeks ago it 
reported heavy losses and casualties among the iraqis 
until the faw offensive iraq had fought a static war since 1982 
behind defense lines of heavy artillery tanks rocket launchers 
and minefields their main offensive operation was a bombing 
campaign against economic targets and iranian cities 
earlier this week khairallah told army commanders to be fully 
ready for new offensives if iran insists on flouting a un 
ceasefire resolution passed july 20 
iraq has said it will abide by the resolution if iran does but 
the iranians say there can be no truce until iraq is designated the 
aggressor iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after border 
skirmishes 
the defense minister said iraq would seek to regain territory 
seized by the iranians the iranians still hold part of the majnoon 
marshes north of basra and iraqi territory in the mountainous 
kurdistan region of the north 
dispatches from baghdad said iraqi warplanes flew more than 600 
miles to bomb the neka power station on the caspian sea 125 miles 
northeast of tehran turning it into ashes the iraqi air force 
also bombed the plant several months ago 
iran said bombs struck the homes of workers near the power 
station but it gave no details irna said other iraqi jets raided 
sardasht a northwestern border town killing 29 civilians 
an iraqi military spokesman said no raids were conducted in the 
sardasht region he said iran was trying to justify iranian 
bombing of iraqi residential areas and to cover up its defeats 
on the battlefield

the relatively light vote behind george 
bushs easy victory in idahos presidential primary raised 
democratic hopes that michael dukakis could claim the states four 
electoral votes in november 
however gop leaders pointed out that idaho has landed in the 
republican column every presidential election since lyndon 
johnsons 1964 national landslide 
bush captured 82 percent of the vote in a gop primary that was 
barely contested pat robertson who pulled out of the campaign 
earlier this month split the other 18 percent with an uncommitted 
bloc 
the result was the vice president adding 15 of the 18 nominating 
delegates at stake to his total that already exceeds the number 
needed for the nomination 
unofficial returns from tuesdays balloting showed bush who 
campaigned in the state during two days three weeks ago receiving 
nearly 56000 of the less than 68000 republican votes cast 
four years ago by comparison president reagan got 97000 of 
106000 votes 
george bush cannot and never has been able to generate 
enthusiasm and strength as ronald reagan has and a lot of people 
didnt care enough about him to go to the polls democratic gov 
cecil andrus said wednesday 
i think that shows the dukakis candidacy will do much better 
than any other democratic candidate has for years in idaho said 
andrus who endorsed dukakis three weeks ago 
the democratic primary was only a popularity contest with no 
delegates at stake dukakis the massachusetts governor won it 
easily with 73 percent of the vote 
that overwhelmed the support he garnered seven weeks earlier in 
the county caucuses where he captured eight convention delegates 
while six went uncommitted and four backed jesse jackson 
turnout on the democratic side was about 51000 that was down 
3500 from the primary four years ago when gary hart of neighboring 
colorado was trying to wrest the democratic nomination from walter 
mondale 
republicans on wednesday were saying little about the primary 
results though some contended the low turnout was due to a lack of 
contested state races 
there just wasnt a big incentive for republicans to get out 
and vote republican sen steve symms said 
symms said of the allbutcertain gop nominee if he brings 
out who the individual george bush is he will win by fall the vice 
president will be able to carry a large vote

a hearing on whether six sailors should 
face courtmartial in the death of a recruit who drowned during 
training in a swimming pool opened wednesday with the investigating 
officer ruling to keep the proceedings open 
airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis died march 2 
while receiving airsea rescue training at the navy rescue swimmer 
school at the pensacola naval air station 
five swimming instructors are accused of dragging mirecki into 
the pool and holding his head under water while struggling with him 
until he collapsed and later died the sixth man charged is their 
commanding officer 
a cause of death is not mentioned in the charges against the six 
military lawyers for two of the instructors argued wednesday 
that the hearing should be closed because extensive press coverage 
may prejudice a future courtmartial panel 
lt cmdr larry d wynne the goverments lawyer argued to keep 
the hearing open 
daniel j dalesio jr the investigating officer agreed 
saying such hearings are traditionally and presumptively open and 
public access promotes fairness and confidence in the military 
legal system however he reserved the right to close portions of 
the hearing 
i think the law is clear if there is any closure it is to be 
done with a scalpel not an ax dalesio said 
lynn johansen mireckis sister and her husband lawrence 
attended the wednesday session navy officials have denied charges 
by the johansens that they were slow to investigate mireckis 
death charges were filed may 10 after two months of investigating 
the johansens said during the investigation that the navy 
refused to confirm or deny accusations by mireckis classmates that 
the recruit was roughly treated by instructors just before his 
death the johansens said the students told them they were ordered 
to turn their backs to the pool while the instructors kept mirecki 
in the water and sing the star spangled banner to drown out his 
screams 
i think what pushed us all along is that we lost our lee and 
thats what were looking for not for revenge or anything but 
we still are driven by wanting to know the true facts mrs 
johansen said late tuesday 
other action wednesday was limited to lawyers objections to 
various statements collected by investigators another procedural 
hearing is scheduled friday beause two defense lawyers were unable 
to be present wednesday 
dalesio of the naval legal service office in philadelphia 
said the hearing then will recess until june 4 when the first 
witnesses are to testify

vietnam and the united states are considering 
a highlevel meeting to discuss the resettlement of vietnamese who 
worked with americans during the war and have been freed from 
prison camps there the state department said wednesday 
spokesman charles redman said vietnamese foreign minister nguyen 
co thatch sent a may 23 message through the us embassy in 
bangkok thailand asking for a meeting with us presidential 
envoy retired army gen john vessey 
vessey held talks with vietnamese officials in hanoi last year 
on stepping up efforts to find some 2500 americans missing in 
action from the indochinese war 
contacts with vietnam which does not have diplomatic relations 
with the united states have been sporadic in recent years the 
united states has adopted a policy of isolating vietnam 
economically and diplomatically in order to pressure the hanoi 
government into ending its 10year military occupation of cambodia 
secretary of state george p shultz sent a letter last month to 
thatch welcoming vietnams release of hundreds of prisoners from 
socalled reeducation camps in september 1987 and february 1988 
redman said 
but shultzs letter also expressed our concern about the fate 
of these prisoners because of their association with us and the 
former saigon government redman said 
the former vietnamese officials and loyalists were placed in 
prison camps after communist north vietnam defeated usbacked 
south vietnam in 1975 
shultz asked thatch to discuss resettlement of the released 
prisoners in the united states a move which reflects our 
continuing concern for the welfare of our former allies redman 
added 
slightly more than 1000 political prisoners were freed in 
february 1988 and vietnamese officials have assured the united 
states that fewer than 150 people remain in reeducation camps 
said a state department official 
the official who asked not to be named said some 900000 
vietnamese had undergone shortterm or longterm reeducation 
since 1975 he said only a handful of those who were released from 
the camps have come to the united states

an internal study ordered by defense secretary 
frank c carlucci concludes the pentagon could eliminate 7300 jobs 
from its headquarters around the world or 12 percent of the total 
without jeopardizing military readiness 
such cuts would save more than 300 million a year in operating 
cost and eliminate duplication that in some cases almost guarantees 
americas military forces will have a hard time fighting any war 
the study asserts 
the situation has gotten so out of hand the pentagon doesnt 
even properly count its headquarters staff it added 
we have a situation where the department is reporting about 
33132 positions in unified and specified commands and supporting 
service component commands in budget justifications provided 
congress while we identified 59510 positions in these same 
headquarters during the review it said 
the review disclosed significant areas of overlapping 
responsibilities duplication of functions layering and 
opportunities for saving manpower 
the study requested by carlucci last dec 14 was performed by 
a 22member panel chaired by derek j vander schaaf the defense 
departments deputy inspector general the associated press 
obtained a copy wednesday 
the inchthick report has been closely held since its completion 
in february on the ground that carlucci is still awaiting a review 
of the findings by adm william j crowe chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff 
that review is not expected to be completed before next month at 
the earliest but the study itself was provided to key 
congressional leaders on tuesday 
carlucci asked vander schaaf whose office serves as an internal 
watchdog to review the organization of the joint chiefs and the 
major military commands after the white house and congress reached 
a deficitreduction agreement cutting defense spending at the 
time carlucci said he hoped to reduce overhead costs 
although probably no one will agree with all of the 
recommendations contained in this report i believe that 
substantial savings can be made without jeopardizing military 
readiness vander schaaf wrote 
in many cases output will actually increase when layering and 
staff sizes are reduced i recommend the elimination of 7309 
military and civilian positions by the end of fiscal 1989 
the study panel spotlighted what it called overlapping or 
superfluous headquarters units that amounted to military 
bureaucracy run amok

the us forces caribbean command in key west fla was 
established as a response to reports of a soviet brigade in 
cuba 
but in all the important contingencies imaginable it appears 
the command will either get in the way or be ignored the command 
is clearly not essential to either our peacetime or wartime needs 
the division of responsibility for air and ground defenses in 
alaska is confusing and will probably not work in an emergency 
it said the situation has been complicated by the need to 
obtain the political blessing of sen ted stevens ralaska a top 
member of the senate defense appropriations subcommittee 
the army has a separate western command in hawaii designated 
as its representative to the us pacific command the pentagon 
simply cannot afford the luxury of having 527 personnel in a 
command to serve as the army trainer for hawaii and guam and as an 
adviser to the us pacific command on army matters 
the strategic air command maintains a system of air division 
headquarters within the continental united states that is largely 
superfluous and can only be categorized as nice to have but 
unnecessary 
the panel took special aim at the space command the special 
operations command and the transportation command saying it could 
see no reason for each of the military services to have 
headquarters units representing them within those commands 
for example the transportation command does not really need a 
separate military airlift command military sealift command and 
military traffic management command underneath it the study said 
if those units were disbanded the estimated savings in 
headquarters manpower over the next two years would be 1015 
positions 
an additional 286 positions could be slashed from the staff of 
the joint chiefs which now numbers 2005 the study added

because you cant take it with you the 
state senate approved a bill wednesday that would allow lottery 
winners over 65 to receive their winnings sooner than younger 
people who hit the jackpot 
older lottery winners could take the current value of their 
lottery prize in one lump sum or in periodic payments over their 
expected lifetime 
the usual 20year payoff on a lottery prize will not always 
result in a total benefit to the winner who is over 65 as he may 
not live to receive the full benefit said a memo on the bill 
the fact that the unpaid balance would be paid to his estate 
is of little consolation to many elderly winners who may wish to 
fully enjoy the fruits of their good fortune the memo said 
but john quinn director of the lottery division said he 
opposes the bill because it would substantially reduce jackpots 
the jackpot up wednesday was 3 million 
i dont have 3 million to give them i have 14 million 
he said the difference is interest money 
under the current plan a winner would receive 21 annual 
payments of 114000 after taxes said quinn if someone opted to 
take the prize in a 14 million lump sum they would owe about 
580000 in taxes he said 
quinn said he didnt believe any state lotteries now offer the 
lumpsum option 
the average milliondollar lottery winner is 49 years old said 
quinn 
quinn said he had not informed the state legislature of his 
opposition to the bill now before the assembly ways and means 
committee

under current law advertising of games of chance are prohibited 
in interstate commerce except for stateconducted lotteries between 
adjacent states that also have lotteries 
the bill approved by voice vote and sent to the senate would 
allow advertising across state lines of gambling activities such 
as casino gambling and church raffles and bingo conducted by 
public or private groups so long as they are legal in the state 
where they are held 
the legislation would still allow individual states to restrict

the nations commercial banks appear to be 
recovering from their worst year since the depression despite 
mounting bank failures in the southwest and continuing problems 
with loans to third world countries federal regulators said 
wednesday 
the banking system as a whole is sound and getting sounder 
the outlook for the immediate future is cautiously optimistic 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman told 
the senate banking committee 
the performance of farm banks the sore spot of the industry 
several years ago is slowly improving as agriculture recovers from 
its slump he said 
the nations largest banks bedeviled by shaky loans to less 
developed countries wrote off big losses last year and now have 
adequate if not comfortable reserves he said 
and there are signs that the economy of the southwest heavily 
dependent on the oil industry has hit bottom and turned up 
still he warned bank failures in texas could rise from 50 last 
year to 70 this year because banks performance generally lags 
economic changes 
we believe 1989 looks better in texas for two reasons every 
major bank will have its problems resolved in one way or another 
and smaller banks are already showing some recovery in the 
first quarter of 1988 he said 
last year by almost any measure was the worst for the nations 
13650 commercial banks since 1933 a record 184 banks failed 
seidman expects about the same number this year and banking as a 
whole posted its lowest profit level in 54 years a 202 percent 
return on equity 
but the entire drop can be attributed to the 206 billion in 
writeoffs for overseas loans a move the regulators said has 
strengthened banks ability to deal with the problem 
there are two areas of concern said the comptroller of the 
currency robert l clarke whose office regulates nationally 
chartered banks but they should not overshadow the fact that the 
national banking system remains sound 
sen william proxmire dwis agreed that the picture this 
year is by no means gloomy but he raised concerns about the 
possibility that developing country loans will have to be written 
down still further 
banks have written off the loans by about 25 percent to 30 
percent but they trade on the open market at only about 50 cents 
on the dollar he said 
federal reserve board governor h robert heller said 
meaningful progress has been achieved on the third world debt 
problem because much of the value of the loans depends on the 
countries willingness rather than their ability to pay 
judgments vary as to how much they should be written down 
proxmire the chairman of the committee also questioned the 
ability of banks to withstand a severe recession 
what haunts me is that texas today might be the united states 
tomorrow if we have a national recession he said 
seidman whose agency insures bank deposits up to 100000 said 
many banks are prepared to withstand a short recession with few ill 
effects 
he added the fdic fund is adequate to deal with any problems 
we can foresee in the banking system in 1988 
compared with the fund that insures savings institutions the 
fdic is in good shape ending 1987 with 183 billion up slightly 
from the end of 1986 but the fund could record its first loss 
depending on how much it costs to restore first republicbank corp 
of dallas to health 
at least one thrift industry trade group the national council 
of savings institutions is eyeing the fdic as a potential source 
of money to rescue the sampl insurance fund which most analysts say 
will not have enough money to meet the 20 billion to 60 billion 
pricetag of cleaning up insolvent savings institutions 
seidman vigorously opposed that idea arguing that the money 
should come from the thrift industry and as a last resort the 
taxpayer

wheat farmers will be required to idle only 10 
percent of their base acreage for the 1989 harvest compared with 
275 percent for 1988 the agriculture department announced 
wednesday 
deputy secretary peter c myers also said the governments price 
support loan rate for 1989 will be reduced to 206 per bushel from 
221 this year the 1989 target price will be 410 per bushel 
down from 423 for the 1988 wheat crop 
farmers who wish to qualify for price supports and other program 
benefits are required to go along with acreage setaside or 
idling requirements 
the loan rate is how much a farmer can borrow from the usda by 
using the crop as collateral if market prices are significantly 
higher later on the producer usually repays the loan and sells or 
uses the commodity at will if market prices are lower than the 
loan rate the producer has the option of forefeiting the grain to 
usda thereby canceling the debt 
target prices are used to compute federal direct payments to 
producers when market prices are below the target deficiency 
payments are made to make up the difference between the basic loan 
rate or the average market price whichever his higher 
myers said the reduction in the loan rate was necessary to 
maintain us wheats competitiveness in domestic and international 
markets 
the reduction in the setaside for 1989 reflects a drawdown in 
us wheat stockpiles and a decision to rebuild those inventories 
in order to meet future export demand

the agriculture department issued a permit on 
wednesday for a maryland firm to conduct field tests of a 
genetically engineered pesticide that doesnt alter the genetics of 
the pest or the plant being protected 
diane oconnor a spokeswoman said she was told that the 
departments animal and plant health inspection service signed the 
permit for the crop genetics international inc of hanover md 
aimed at protecting corn from the european corn borer through a 
process akin to inoculation 
the environmental protection agency gave its approval on tuesday 
for the test crop genetics plans to take a harmless bacterium 
found in bermuda grass and use it to carry a gene from another 
bacterium called cxcbt that will then produce a toxin lethal to 
corn borers 
the toxin would only be activated inside the alkaline stomach of 
the borer a kind of caterpillar after it eats the treated plant 
tissue 
the acid stomachs of humans birds animals and fish simply 
digest the protein 
cxcbt will have limited persistence in the environment and is 
not likely to be harmful to humans or other nontarget organisms 
epa said 
the effect on other organisms is not of concern epa said 
because the parent cxc strain is native to maryland the 
toxinproducing gene will be naturally eliminated from the cxc and 
stringent containment procedures will be followed 
the firm plans to inoculate 6300 corn plants on 137 acres at 
its research farm at ingleside md and 3500 plants on 078 acre 
at the agriculture departments research center in beltsville just 
outside washington 
the test will last through this fall

a former cia agent will be allowed to 
testify in a 24 million civil suit that accuses former cia 
officials contra leaders and cocaine traffickers of running a 
gunsfordrugs smuggling scheme 
us district judge james lawrence king agreed wednesday to take 
a formal deposition from edwin wilson in the civil suit filed by 
two journalists wilson is in prison on convictions for selling 
explosives and plotting to kill the federal prosecutor in his case 
according to the plaintiffs lawyer daniel sheehan wilson has 
testified that one of the defendants former cia deputy director of 
operations theodore shackley helped set up a secret illegal 
intelligence operation 
the lawsuit filed by journalists tony avirgan and martha honey 
maintains that shackley irancontra figures albert hakim and 
richard secord and others set up the operation to assassinate 
terrorists and enemies of us allies and ship weapons to the 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
wilson shows this is the offtheshelf operation set up by 
shackley secord and hakim just as we have been saying said 
sheehan 
the suit stems from a 1984 bombing of a news conference held by 
maverick contra commander eden pastora in la penca nicaragua 
three journalists and five pastora supporters died in the 
explosion although pastora was only slightly injured 
avirgan was seriously hurt and his camera damaged in the 
explosion under federal law he and his wife ms honey have the 
right to file suit for damages 
wednesdays hearing was held to consider a motion by shackley 
who left the cia in 1979 to drop him as a defendant in the 
lawsuit king said he would not rule immediately 
shackleys attorney jack mckay argued that two years after 
filing suit the plaintiffs have yet to come up with any credible 
evidence connecting shackley to any conspiracy that led to the 
bombing 
but sheehan countered with a sworn statement by wilson saying 
that wilson shackley secord and others had met in 1976 and 1977 
to set up the private intelligence operation to prevent it from 
being ended by the incoming carter administration 
the lawsuit contends the contra gunrunning operation was simply 
one of the latest in a series of activities by the secret team 
including the assassinations of enemies of the shah of iran and 
military aid to somoza both before and after his 1979 overthrow by 
the sandinistas 
after the hearing sheehan hailed kings decision to allow 
wilsons deposition to be taken as a victory for the plaintiffs 
they have argued that events of a decade ago when they claimed 
the operation was set up should be examined in the case prior to 
wednesdays decision king had only allowed depositions covering 
back to 1983 
mckay said the decision was not a setback but added it is 
going to complicate the case 
both sides agree the june 27 trial date will be more difficult 
to meet 
besides shackley secord and hakim other defendants in the suit 
include contra director adolfo calero medellin cartel leaders 
pablo escobar gaviria and jorge ochoa vasquez and retired maj 
gen john k singlaub 
the suit was filed in may 1986 six months before the 
irancontra affair became public and many of the names it brought 
to light have been indicted or appeared before congressional 
committees investigating that case 
all the major figures in the suit have strenuously denied the 
charges in the case 
in a may 6 hearing in miami sheehan accused members of the 
reagan administration of attempting to block the suit because of 
potential damage to vice president george bush who led the cia in 
1976

orourke the actress sucked into a swirling supernatural vacuum in 
the poltergeist movies 
heather died feb 1 on the operating table at childrens 
hospital of san diego she was 12 
she died of septic shock due to congenital stenosis of the 
intestine a bowel blockage the girl evidently had from birth 
hospital officials said at the time 
the suit filed in san diego superior court against kaiser 
foundation hospital of san diego and southern california permanente 
medical group on behalf of kathleen orourke peel heathers mother 
and administrator of her estate does not specify damages 
we want to be free to establish damages said sanford m 
gage the orourke familys attorney 
childrens hospital spokeswoman terry merryman said she could 
not comment on the suit 
kaiser permanente spokesman jim mcbride said about all we can 
say is that we have reviewed the case extensively and we are 
convinced that the care we provided was appropriate but we cant 
discuss the specifics any further 
the lawsuit contends the hospitals diagnosis led to heathers 
death 
the doctors failed to recognize that she had a bowel 
obstruction since birth and misdiagnosed her condition as a 
result they prescribed medication instead of a relatively simple 
operation that would have cured her gage said 
in addition to her poltergeist roles heather was a regular 
on televisions happy days a recurring character on 
webster and still the beaver and one of the stars in an abc 
miniseries on teenage suicide called surviving

the chief opponent of the mediumrange arms 
control treaty conceded defeat wednesday clearing the way for 
possible senate approval of the historic accord before president 
reagan meets soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in moscow this 
weekend 
im fairly confident we will be able to finish the treaty 
friday or saturday senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva said 
that would mean the treaty could be approved in time to fly the 
ratification notice to moscow so the president could present it to 
gorbachev during the may 29june 2 summit byrd noted 
reagan left washington on wednesday for the summit with a 
threeday stopover in helsinki finland en route 
ratification of the intermediaterange nuclear forces pact 
requires 67 votes and is assured because 90 or more senators 
support the treaty according to supporters and critics of the pact 
sen jesse helms rnc the treatys chief critic conceded he 
had failed in his attempt to modify the accord which reagan and 
gorbachev signed dec 8 in washington 
im licked in terms of doing anything on the treaty helms 
told reporters 
later helms admitted ive had no illusions from the very 
beginning about the prospects of defeating this treaty 
the treaty requires elimination within three years of all us 
and soviet nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3400 
miles it would result in the elimination of 867 us missiles in 
europe and elimination of 1752 soviet missiles 
helms byrd and other senate leaders met behind closed doors to 
work out an agreement that would end the procedural snarl which has 
blocked definitive action on the pact since it reached the floor 
last week 
helms and other critics using senate rules designed to protect 
the rights of the minority have stalled action filing a series of 
amendments that were rejected overwhelmingly 
in response byrd and senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
filed a cloture motion to halt debate that motion is set for a 
vote thursday approval of the motion requires 60 votes and is 
assured meaning the debate would be limited to 30 hours that 
would set up a final vote friday 
the backstage talks were aimed at setting aside the cloture 
vote which also would mean the senate could avoid the allnight 
session which would be required if cloture were invoked 
helms said that after the cloture motion was filed he realized 
the ball game was over but he said he still was seeking 
approval of some amendments which could be attached as conditions 
to the resolution of ratification 
but there was no agreement by late wednesday afternoon meaning 
the cloture vote was likely to go ahead thursday morning 
meantime the chamber voted 899 to reject a helms amendment 
which would have abrogated the treaty if the united states found 
that the soviets had furnished false information it was the 10th 
time the senate had voted overwhelming rejection of amendments 
offered by gop conservatives 
the soviets have cheated on other treaties they are 
cheating now and they will continue to cheat said helms 
but sen richard lugar rind said the proposal would be a 
killer amendment that would require the pact to be renegotiated 
with the soviets 
dole said the reagangorbachev meeting as do all summits 
offers the promise of progress and the peril of inflated 
expectations 
he urged the senate to do our part and approve the inf pact 
which he noted is the first ever to reduce existing nuclear 
stockpiles and eliminate whole classes of nuclear weapons 
one unresolved issue in the senate was the fate of a 
democraticbacked proposal which would require senate approval 
before any future president could change how the treaty is 
interpreted 
that amendment added by the senate foreign relations committee 
arises from a longrunning fight over a separate issue involving 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
reagan asserts that the white house can unilaterally change the 
interpretation of a treaty a view disputed by congressional 
democrats 
many senate republicans oppose that amendment sen arlen 
specter rpa noted wednesday 
this issue of treaty interpretation is one that will have 
farreaching consequences specter told his colleagues 
byrd said democrats still havent decided the specific language 
of that amendment

the chairman of the new york stock exchange 
said wednesday that continuing market skittishness is due to 
uncertainty over the future of the economy not to lingering 
aftershocks of the october market crash 
i think the markets are really looking toward the future 
and cannot make up their minds about it john j phelan jr said 
i think when they make up their minds confidence will return 
phelan in a luncheon speech to congressional clearinghouse on 
the future acknowledged that small investors have pulled out of 
the market since the plunge of last october but said i think 
they are behaving very prudently now which is in times of 
uncertainty do nothing 
phelan said his own view of the economys prospects was 
somewhere between that of the pessismists who have predicted a 
1930s style depression and optimists who assert the economy is 
headed for a rolling correction entailing little more than 
somewhat higher interest rates and slower growth 
unless you believe in the tooth fairy you dont believe the 
business cycle has gone away he said there are the beginnings 
of certain classic signs of the end of an economic expansion 
unless something is very strange the next 18 months to two years 
are not going to be easy 
but looking toward the 1990s and beyond phelan said the future 
looks bright 
im 57 years old and the bears have always lost he said 
the clearinghouse is a bipartisan caucus of senators and 
representatives concerned with longrange trends and issues of the 
future

a virginia congressman introduced legislation 
wednesday he said would speed congressional efforts to protect the 
manassas national battlefield from encroaching commercial 
development 
the bill by rep frank wolf rva calls for immediate 
government acquisition of the approximately 600 acres adjacent to 
the park where a developer plans to build a shopping mall 
it also directs the interior secretary to make sure the scenery 
around the park is protected calls for closing two roads that 
bisect the civil war site and proposes a bypass to carry traffic 
around the area 
a bill already has been introduced for government purchase of 
the land now owned by hazelpeterson co developers but it directs 
acquisition through the interior department a slower process than 
the legislative taking of the land recommended by wolf 
the earlier legislation was introduced by reps robert mrazek 
dny and michael andrews dtexas and by wednesday had 166 
cosponsors 
tad boggs mrazeks press secretary said the congressman is 
wholeheartedly endorsing the wolf bill 
he hopes that it can be melded together with his bill but it 
accomplishes everything he hopes to see done boggs said 
i think everyone should be pleased that a virginian has 
finally said no to the shopping mall andrews said 
stan parris another virginia congressman whose district is near 
the battlefield just outside washington said he will cosponsor 
wolfs bill 
rep d french slaughter jr whose district includes the park 
is studying the bill according to his administrative assistant 
george white 
ian spatz spokesman for the national trust for historic 
preservation which also has been fighting the developer said his 
organization was encouraged to have wolfs support 
we want to study it further but it looks like something we 
could support said spatz wolfs plan provides more 
certainty that the property owner would get paid for the property 
interior secretary donald hodel had proposed that the developer 
move the shopping mall so it would not be visible from the park he 
also said the roads bisecting the park should be closed 
though preservationists like the idea of closing the roads they 
say the mall should not be anywhere near the park because of 
traffic problems it would create

a federal judge has directed the government to 
require that warnings about the health hazards of smokeless tobacco 
be printed on umbrellas towels and other items used to promote the 
products 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson ruled that the 
smokeless tobacco act is clear and unequivocal in its 
requirement that all advertising for smokeless tobacco except 
billboards carry warnings the products may cause mouth cancer 
gum disease or tooth loss 
jackson ordered the federal trade commission to revise 
regulations that had also exempted promotional items such as 
tshirts promotional banners coffee mugs and caps from the 
requirement 
the judge stayed his order however to give the ftc an 
opportunity to appeal the decision 
jackson ruled that the exemption given by the ftc to promotional 
items undercut the clear intent of congress in passing the law 
if vendors of smokeless tobacco products are able to put their 
wares before prospective consumers bare of warning labels on 
tshirts hats coffee mugs beverage coolers and the like as a 
practical matter they may effectively frustrate the purpose of the 
warning label requirements by doing most of their advertising with 
utilitarian giveaways jackson said in an opinion dated may 20 
but made public wednesday 
jackson made the ruling in a lawsuit brought last year by the 
american cancer society the american heart association the 
american lung association and the public health association

tass adopted an upbeat presummit tone wednesday 
quoting president reagan as saying he was coming to the soviet 
union in the interests of peace 
the evening television news program vremya carried a report from 
a washington correspondent on reagans visit and later showed 
reagan leaving for helsinki finland en route to moscow 
tass the official soviet news agency quoted reagans departure 
statement that he intended to work in the interests of peace during 
his visit to the soviet capital next week 
it quoted reagan as saying measures to reduce tension between 
the superpowers capped by the signing of the agreement banning 
medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles at the last summit in 
washington last december were only a beginning 
the agency said reagan pledged to work for an agreement to cut 
us and soviet longrange missiles during his meetings with 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev in moscow 
it relegated reagans comments on the deep differences that 
still divide the soviet union and the united states to the final 
paragraph of its dispatch 
a pair of later articles distributed by tass were more critical 
one was a commentary by military analyst vladimir bogachev he 
said the reagan administration had backtracked on a pledge at the 
washington summit to observe the antiballistic missile treaty as 
signed in 1972 rather than using reagans broad interpretation 
that would allow more free development of the star wars program 
for a spacebased nuclear defense 
isnt it time that washington began showing a more responsible 
attitude to its commitments bogachev asked 
in a separate story tass said a group of soviet scientists 
appealed to reagan for more flexibility in allowing soviets to 
travel to the united states it cited the cases of several 
scientists who it said were denied visas 
tass quoted viktor karpov in another report as saying that 
reagan and gorbachev could exchange in moscow instruments of 
ratification of the december agreement if the us senate ratifies 
the treaty soon 
karpov head of the foreign ministrys arms control department 
said monday that the soviet union should not ratify the treaty 
before the united states does 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said wednesday 
that the senate should be prepared to take final action on the 
treaty friday or saturday 
there are no doubts that the soviet union will not delay that 
historic act by taking too long to ratify the inf intermediate 
nuclear forces treaty karpov said 
the treaty must be approved by the presidium of the supreme 
soviet the countrys top executive body

serious condition along with his mother wednesday after what may 
have been a double suicide attempt following the seizure of his 
company police said 
tex zachary hildreth fled the braintree mass area just before 
his 5yearold computer services company massdata corp was 
closed by authorities and its assets seized tuesday hildreth left 
behind about 30 angry employees and investors 
he was arrested as a fugitive from justice in manchester on 
tuesday after an employee at the holiday inn called police to 
report a bloodied man wandering in the lobby police said that when 
they arrived just after 2 pm they found hildreths mother rose 
hildreth 50 lying injured in the hotel room the two shared 
police lt william bovaird said both hildreths were taken to 
elliot hospital where according to hospital spokeswoman ann 
williams they were listed in serious condition wednesday 
bovaird said both hildreths were incoherent when police 
arrived at the hotel he gave only sketchy details about their 
injuries but said it appeared that hildreth may have slashed his 
wrists he said a bottle of nonprescription pills were found in 
the hotel room along with what appeared to be suicide notes 
bovaird declined to elaborate saying the case was still under 
investigation 
on monday rockland trust co owed more than 400000 tried to

about him from several people who said they did business with him 
mcgorty said weymouth police had charged hildreth with larceny 
over 250 tuesday after receiving a complaint from another person 
mcgorty said the investigation into hildreths business dealings 
was expected to be lengthy 
hildreths sudden fall came after a meteoric rags to riches 
tale hildreth was an overweight unhappy teenager who transformed 
himself into a computer whiz and budding millionaire just a few 
years out of high school 
hildreths company turned profitable in 1987 and expected sales

as recently as last month hildreth was profiled in an article 
that began with a description of him stepping out of a limousine 
with a beautiful woman to attend the fifth reunion of his braintree 
high school class in november 
this was my revenge for four years of hell hildreth said at 
the time 
after buying his first computer at age 16 hildreth began 
writing software programs the confidence he gained as a computer 
whiz prompted him to lose 115 pounds in less than two years

george bush said wednesday that a 
liberal elite is jeopardizing us security by opposing every 
new weapons system that would preserve a strong defense 
he also expressed optimism that panamas gen manuel noriega 
could be induced to step aside despite secretary of state george 
shultz announcement that negotiations aimed at achieving that had 
failed and no new talks were set 
im convinced noriega will be out of power bush told 
reporters in lakehurst nj 
speaking at a commencement ceremony at the us military 
academy the vice president said of unnamed liberals they are so 
blinded by ideology that they cannot see what americans have 
understood for 40 years that peace flows from strength 
the republican presidential nomineetobe did not say who he was 
referring to apparently in deference to a federal ban on political 
activity on military installations but it was clear he was talking 
about democrats michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
im sure theyd claim it isnt so and theyre all in favor of 
a strong defense bush said they look the part sober and 
measured in their gray suits moving their hands on the sunday talk 
shows with just the right amount of gravity and earnestness 
but what are we to think when they say theyre for a strong 
defense but they oppose every new weapons system that would 
preserve that strength bush asked 
asked about noriega bush told reporters in new jersey the 
fact that we havent solved this doesnt depress me 
i dont want a bad deal i want a good deal he said 
well have to go back and figure it out 
bushs aides said last week that the vice president had urged 
that talks with noriega be suspended however bush said while he 
and president reagan had some differences on the matter they both 
had the same policy objective of getting noriega out 
the vice president again denied that he had known of noriegas 
alleged drugdealing before the panamanian leader was indicted on 
us drug charges he said he thought noriega should be extradited 
to the us to face the chargs but acknowledged that would be 
difficult in light of the lack of a us extradition treaty 
with panama 
at west point bush delivered the speech under a small canopy on 
the field of the academys football stadium in a driving rainstorm 
then stayed to shake hands with each of the 939 graduating cadets 
and watched as they hurled their caps aloft 
bush who in the past has criticized both dukakis and jackson by 
name for a lack of foreign policy experience noted that reagan 
left wednesday morning for the upcoming superpower summit in moscow 
praising the five years of patient effort toward a nuclear 
arms limitation treaty bush said the summit was no reason for 
complacency toward the soviets 
we must be confident that those who will lead our country 
understand what it means to stand up to a challenge and meet our 
commitments bush said we must be confident that they will 
pursue negotiations with the soviets realistically 
bush aides had billed the speech as nonpartisan and the vice 
president did praise former democratic presidents harry s truman 
and john f kennedy 
they along with republican president dwight eisenhower were 
part of a bipartisan consensus on dealing firmly with the soviets 
that bush said lasted from the 1940s to the mid1960s 
there are some today who have abandoned those principles he 
said the liberal elite do not understand they never understood 
the common sense behind the consensus 
later addressing a group of senior citizens at a retirement 
village in lakehurst nj bush continued on the same defense 
theme and said weve got to keep our eyes wide open while 
negotiating with the soviets 
i am not naive aboutt soviet intentions we are on the right 
track we should not be afraid to talk we should never talk from a 
position of weakness he said 
bushs campaign meanwhile acknowledged that chief spokesman 
peter teeley was shifting to other duties 
hes going to make a job switch said campaign manager lee 
atwater he said teeley would be a more creative type guy and 
work specifically on the surrogate teams 
no reason was given for the change but teeley and bush chief of 
staff craig fuller were known to be at odds 
on thursday after campaigning in the newark area bush will fly 
to his oceanside vacation retreat in kennebunkport maine where he 
will spend the next week in a series of strategy and issues 
sessions while reagan is in moscow

two jetliners carrying a total of 286 people 
were assigned the same altitude and missed colliding headon by 300 
feet over the ocean north of puerto rico last monday officials 
disclosed wednesday 
according to the officials the pilots of the southbound pan 
american world airways a300 and the northbound american airlines 
boeing 727 did not see each other until the planes were passing at 
better than 500 miles an hour 
neither pilot had time to take evasive action spokesmen for the 
two airlines said 
federal aviation administration spokesman fred farrar confirmed 
that both jetliners were assigned to 29000 feet and were under the 
control of the san juan air traffic control center at the time of 
the incident that section of airspace is beyond faa radar so 
separation is maintained by assigning specific altitudes 
the incident is being investigated as a possible operational 
error by air traffic controllers farrar said he said he did not 
know whether the controllers involved have been removed from 
directing aircraft normally the procedure after such an incident 
the pan am plane was flight 217 from new york to caracas 
venezuela and on to trinidad and carried 131 passengers and 10 
crewmembers the northbound plane was american flight 902 from san 
juan to philadelphia with 138 passengers and seven crewmembers 
aboard 
the section of airspace about 550 miles north of puerto rico in 
the socalled bermuda triangle is beyond faa radar at both san juan 
and on the us mainland 
commercial jets operate under oceanic flight rules and are still 
under radio air traffic direction they are assigned specific 
altitudes to maintain proper separation 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said the pan am pilot filed a 
nearcollision report with the faa the american jets pilots also 
filed a report according to american spokesman john hotard 
farrar said the faa still was investigating who gave the planes 
their altitude assignments 
a source who asked not to be identified by name said the 
incident occurred near where control of planes switches from the 
faa center in new york to the san juan center and the handoff may 
have resulted in an altitude mixup 
farrar said he could not confirm that 
farrar said the two jetliners had about 300 feet horizontal 
separation as they passed both aircraft observed each other as 
they passed he said 
investigators for the national transportation safety board flew 
to san juan on wednesday to interview the controllers involved 
said ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
we are investigating the incident were looking into it 
lopatkiewicz said he said the investigators may later interview 
the pilots

senators approved on second reading 
wednesday a bill that bans nuclear weapons on philippine territory 
but allows port calls by nuclearpowered ships 
orlando mercado majority floor leader said the senate is 
expected to pass the bill next week on third reading a formality 
where the legislators register their votes 
the bill prohibits manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons in 
the country but was amended to allow nuclearpowered vessels to 
make port calls after they are inspected by philippine authorities 
the chief sponsor of the measure sen wigberto tanada is an 
antinuclear activisit and opposes us bases in the philippines 
most senators hailed passage of the bill and said it would give 
president corazon aquinos administration a stronger hand in 
negotiating with us officials on the future of clark air base 
subic naval base and four smaller us military facilities here 
sen mamintal tamano who earlier expressed concern about the 
bills implications said this is a backdoor way of repudiating 
the existing treaty between the us and the philippines and the 
termination of the bases agreement 
the americans will be very uncomfortable with such a law 
which will render the bases ineffective 
antinuclear activists have accused the americans of using the 
bases as storage or transit points for nuclear weapons us 
authorities have refused to say yes or no 
us policy also is to remain silent on whether a navy vessel is 
carrying nuclear weapons 
on april 5 us and filipino negotiators started a threemonth 
review of the 1947 agreement governing us bases here the 
agreement expires in 1991 
tanada said his bill will strengthen the position of our panel 
in their negotiations with the us a colleague sen rene 
saguisag said it gives mrs aquino a credible option on the 
bases issue 
the president has said she would keep her options open until 
1991 
sen aquilino pimentel an opponent of the bases said the bill 
will send a very strong signal to the world that the philippines 
is an independent nation

the collapse of the negotiations aimed at 
inducing gen manuel antonio noriega to step down from power in 
panama was greeted with relief on capitol hill from republicans and 
democrats alike wednesday 
i cant help but welcome this announcement said senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan noriega must go if we are to 
achieve our goals in panama but sending noriega off into 
retirement with a legal golden parachute would have been the 
wrong step at the wrong time 
secretary of state george p shultz announced wednesday that the 
negotiations between the united states and noriegas 
representatives had failed and no further talks were planned 
noriega would not carry through with the arrangements his 
representatives have negotiated shultz told an impromptu news 
conference 
dole had sponsored a resolution overwhelmingly adopted last week 
that put the senate on record in opposition to any deal that would 
have dropped us drugtrafficking charges against the panamanian 
leader 
not only were we going the extra mile to win noriegas 
departure said dole we may have been going too many extra 
miles perhaps the signal the senate was trying to send around this 
town and around the world was heeded 
sen john warner rva agreed i think we should make no 
deals that involve dropping drug charges that sends the wrong 
message particularly when we are trying to show more resolve 
against drugs 
sen alfonse damato rny said we missed many 
opportunities to get him out we should not have precluded the use 
of force its a surrender 
the administrations negotiations were nothing but bluster and 
bluff said damato a sharp critic of dropping the 
drugtrafficking charges it was wishful thinking on the 
administrations part 
sen alan cranston dcalif said frankly i dont see the 
collapse of the proposed deal as a major problem for the united 
states this administration has handled the noriega situation so 
badly that it is an embarrassment to the united states it wasnt a 
good deal for us 
this administration negotiates with the darndest people 
iranian terrorists and panamanian drug dealers said cranston 
i think we should have an administration which doesnt negotiate 
with people like that 
i think we need a multilateral approach to this problem in 
panama said cranston 
shultz at the news conference said the united states would 
work through other countries in the hemisphere in pursuit of its 
goal to get noriega out of panama 
meanwhile vice president george bush expressed optimism that 
noriega could be persuaded to step down telling reporters in 
lakehurst nj im convinced noriega will be out of power 
the fact that we havent solved this doesnt depress me 
said bush as he pursued his campaign for the presidency i dont 
want a bad deal i want a good deal well have to go back and 
figure it out 
bushs aides said last week that the vice president had urged 
that talks with noriega be suspended however bush said while he 
and president reagan had some differences on the matter they both 
had the same policy objective of getting noriega out

the state government said wednesday a 
gas and kerosene depot in a residential area has been closed and 
would be moved because of an explosion and fire that forced 
evacation of 100000 people 
spokesman sergio villarreal said at least 100000 residents had 
to flee tuesday as leaping flames threatened to ignite tanks filled 
with gasoline 
no one was seriously injured in the blast tuesday at the depot 
owned by pemex the state oil monopoly however several 
firefighters suffered minor burns and pemex employee luis alonso 
said he saw several car accidents caused by fleeing motorists 
the depot is closed villarreal said it was a state 
government decision that was supported by petroleos mexicanos 
pemex 
villarreal said an unpopulated site on the southern outskirts of 
the city of chihuahua had been selected for the new depot but he 
could not say how long it would take before it is opened 
local newspapers and neighborhood organizations had been 
demanding for nearly two years that the depot be relocated because 
of danger of explosion the daily chihuahua newspaper novedades 
said wednesday 
a pemex spokesman francisco cortez coronado declined comment 
on the depot closing saying the company was preparing an official 
statement

more than 100 pemex workers and firefighters worked until 830 
pm to put out the blaze which melted the top third of the 
11milliongallon steel tank 
the nearby gasoline tank scorched by the blaze was hosed with 
ice water throughout the day to keep the gasoline from reaching its 
flashpoint 
villarreal said the texas state government sent 6000 pounds of 
a firefighting solvent known as soft water to help battle the 
blaze 
residents were informed shortly after 8 pm that they could 
return to their homes 
the pemex supply depot which employs about 150 workers was 
built in 1952 in what then was open fields now it sits in the 
middle of heavily populated residential districts in this city of

the depot which supplies area gasoline station and other 
petroleum users includes 14 tanks capable of holding 11 million 
gallons in addition to several small tanks containing two grades 
of gasoline diesel fuel and kerosene

a washington attorney convicted of arranging a 
bribe for his close friend federal judge alcee l hastings of 
miami refused to testify wednesday before a house panel 
considering hastings impeachment 
accompanied by two lawyers william a borders invoked his fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination and told the house 
judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice that he would refuse 
to answer any and all questions about the case 
borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a 150000 bribe for 
hastings from two miami racketeers frank and tom romano in 
exchange for a promise of lenient sentences one year later a 
separate trial jury acquitted hastings of conspiring with borders 
to solicit a bribe from the romano brothers 
borders was fined 35000 served 33 months in a federal prison 
at allenwood pa and was disbarred by the district of columbia 
court of appeals 
i believe that my legal debt to society expired on may 22 
1988 after my release from parole borders told the house 
subcommittee that is investigating impeachment charges by a 
judicial panel against hastings 
rep john conyers jr dmich who is presiding over the 
televised hearings deferred what he called the subcommittees 
very difficult decision whether to grant borders immunity from 
prosecution to compel his testimony 
borders has remained silent about the alleged bribery conspiracy 
since he was indicted in late 1981 he refused to testify at both 
his and hastings trials and never appeared before a special 
investigative panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals that 
was appointed shortly after hastings was acquitted 
the judicial panel after a 3year study concluded there was 
clear and convincing evidence that hastings not only had 
engaged in a bribery schee but tried to conceal his role by lying 
under oath and fabricating evidence at his trial 
hastings has insisted that he knew nothing of the bribery plot 
and accuses borders of trading on his name in an attempt to shake 
down the romanos hastings who is floridas first black federal 
judge says the case against him is racially and politically 
motivated 
after borders was excused conyers led the subcommittee in close 
and sometimes critical questioning of john doar chief counsel to 
the fivejudge appellate panel whose charges against hastings 
prompted the house impeachment proceedings 
conyers said it was amazing that fbi agents arrested borders 
after he had received 125000 in bribery money from an undercover 
agent posing as frank romano but before borders could have given 
the money to someone else 
hastings was staying at a hotel five minutes away when borders 
was arrested oct 9 1981 inside a car with the undercover agent 
and a garment bag stuffed with 125000 in cash 
a few hours later hastings presumably would have met borders at 
an evening boating party which he and other friends were giving in 
borders honor but hastings flew home to miami shortly after he 
learned of borders arrest 
the fbi in effect broke up its own entrapment conyers 
said he said that seemed to suggest that they didnt believe 
there was anyone else involved in a bribery scheme 
doar said he understood that the fbi was not prepared to let 
the money get out of their control in any event he said the 
judicial panel believed there was plenty of other evidence 
implicating hastings in a bribery scheme 
they did not need the money to arrive in judge hastings 
hands no sir doar said 
doar agreed with rep don edwards dcalif that the case 
against hastings would have been almost impregnable if borders 
had actually passed money to hastings edwards said he felt it was 
significant that the fbi did not wait to see if this happened 
conyers said it also was very important for his subcommittee 
to determine why the justice department decided against bringing 
perjury charges against hastings before the statute of limitations 
expired in his case in january 1987 
under questioning by conyers doar conceded that william dredge 
a miami drug runner who tipped authorities to a possible bribery 
scheme could have made false and reckless charges against the 
judge because of dredges known racial prejudice 
rep mike synar dokla asked doar if there is any way you 
think you could be wrong in contending that hastings was involved 
in a bribery conspiracy and an attempted coverup 
doar a former assistant us attorney general who was special 
counsel for house impeachment proceedings against president nixon 
in 1974 said no theres not 
later us district judges william terrell hodges of tampa 
fla and anthony a alaimo of brunswick ga testified about 
their decision to file a postacquittal complaint against hastings 
that sparked the judicial panels investigation 
hodges said their complaint was prompted partly by an appeals 
court decision upholding borders conviction which suggested 
hastings may have been involved in a conspiracy with borders 
hodges emphatically denied the complaint was filed because hastings 
is black 
hastings allowed to crossexamine his fellow judges said 
litigants will be the losers when collegiality is destroyed 
among federal judges who file charges against each other

the breakdown in negotiations with panamas 
manuel antonio noriega is the latest twist in a bizarre 
confrontation that has left the united states seemingly powerless 
to engineer the military chiefs ouster 
instead of controlling events in panama us policymakers seem 
to be the victims of a wily military chief and of their own failure 
to realize the strength of his grip on power 
secretary of state george p shultz announced the collapse of 
the negotiations on wednesday he said the united states would 
continue efforts to get noriega out of power but he announced no 
specific steps 
what to do about noriega has been a major preoccupation of the 
reagan administration since february when he was indicted by a 
federal grand jury in miami on charges of taking at least 46 
million in payoffs from colombias medellin cartel to protect 
cocaine shipments launder money and hide drug smugglers from law 
enforcement officials 
its not clear if officials ever thought they would actually be 
able to bring noriega to trial if they did or if they thought 
the indictment would lead to a withering of noriegas power they 
were mistaken 
on feb 25 in what may have been a move suggested by the united 
states president eric arturo delvalle announced noriegas 
dismissal then the noriegadominated national assembly ousted 
delvalle and replaced him with education minister manuel solis 
palma 
us pressure began the reagan administration continued to 
recognize delvalle federal courts blocked the withdrawal of 
panamanian funds from american banks economic sanctions were 
imposed washington gave verbal support to striking panamanians and 
deplored police actions against demonstrators 
state department officials whispered privately that noriega 
would be history in just a few days or weeks at most 
on march 16 noriega survived a coup attempt by dissident army 
officers and the next day a state of emergency was declared giving 
soldiers power to patrol the capital 
when pressure didnt work the united states tried negotiations 
the first offer made march 18 was to allow noriega to go to a 
third country and to assure him he would not be extradited to the 
united states on the drug charges the offer was tempered two days 
later when shultz said the indictments would not be dropped and 
that noriega would have no say in the formation of a transition 
government 
by early may the situation appeared to be in a stalemate as 
deputy assistant secretary of state michael kozak began a set of 
secret negotiations with noriega the us officials who had 
predicted noriegas imminent departure were no longer talking about 
it 
kozak was reported to have reached a tentative agreement with 
noriega that would include his resignation as defense chief 
departure from the country in august not to return until after may 
1989 elections the deal also would permit noriega to have a hand 
in forming a transition government 
the offer divided the administration because it included the 
dismissal of the drug indictments against noriega officials in the 
justice department and the prosecutors who won the indictments 
denounced the proposal 
vice president george bush who prides himself on his loyalty to 
reagan had to confront questions every day on whether he supported 
dropping the charges finally he made his answer known he said as 
president he would not negotiate with drug traffickers at home or 
abroad 
shultz argued that the situation in panama warranted the 
dropping of charges against noriega since he wouldnt allow 
himself to be extradited anyway and the deal was set 
in another demonstration of noriegas power to control events 
shultz delayed his departure for helsinki on wednesday where he 
was to join reagan in preparatory sessions for next weeks 
superpower summit in moscow 
his wait was in vain noriega still said no

european nato members bristled at us 
complaints that they spend too little on defense and insisted on 
wednesday that they were carrying their weight in the alliance 
they issued a joint rebuttal stressing their nonfinancial 
contributions to the north atlantic treaty organization 
europe is taking a fair share of the burdens in the 
alliance said wim van eekelen the dutch defense minister and 
chairman of eurogroup an informal bloc of 12 european countries 
van eekelen and defense ministers of the other member countries 
presented a detailed brochure explaining their current role in nato 
the report said that of natos standing forces the united 
states allies provide 90 percent of the manpower and artillery 80 
percent of the tanks and combat aircraft and 65 percent of the 
major warships 
it said 35 million european men and women are on active duty 
and another 35 million are in reserve the united states has 23 
million soldiers on active duty and 15 million in reserve the 
report said 
van eekelen said he planned to address the issue on behalf of 
the european nato members thursday at the regular spring meeting of 
alliance defense ministers including us defense secretary frank 
c carlucci 
the nato meeting is expected to authorize an indepth study of 
how the allies share the burdens of western defense and how they 
can make better use of funds now available by cooperating more in 
building arms 
van eekelen told a news conference that while washington was 
justified in urging the allies to do more for the common defense of 
the west many members of congress were wrong to say europe is 
shirking its duty 
its one of the perceptions that have grown steadily but it 
is not entirely warranted van eekelen said it is important 
that the true extent of the european contribution to the alliance 
be properly understood 
he noted that the administration of president reagan had taken a 
less confrontational approach to the issue than some members of 
congress 
the west german newspaper die welt on wednesday quoted reagan as 
saying in an interview with european newspapers i dont think 
this is an area that should cause bad blood between us 
the eurogroup report acknowledged that all the allies should try 
to do more for the common defense in part by better managing their 
budgets 
they recognize that a stronger european defense effort is 
necessary in order to maintain the effectiveness of the alliances 
deterrent strategy and to satisfy legitimate american concerns over 
burden sharing the report said 
van eekelen said that while us defense spending has grown much 
more rapidly than europes since reagan took office in 1981 the 
comparison looks much different if calculations are based on a 
longer time span 
between 1970 and 1987 for example the defense expenditures of 
the european nato members grew by 34 percent compared with a 15 
percent increase for the united states the eurogroup report said 
actual us defense spending last year was 67 percent of the 
us gross national product which is the broadest measure of 
economic output the equivalent figure for the europeans was 33 
percent 
the eurogroup report said comparisons of defense spending tell 
only half the story of how the 16 nato allies share the burdens 
of their common defense 
it said the money figures do not take account of such other 
burdens born as environmental damage caused by nato military 
maneuvers it also cited a sacrifice of income from european real 
estate that is dedicated to military bases and other defense 
facilities 
in a related matter van eekelen said he expected thursdays 
nato meeting to issue a formal request for italy to accept the 
basing of 72 us f16 fighter jets that spain is forcing off its 
territory the main problem he said is deciding how the cost of 
transferring the planes and 4000 us soldiers to italy will be 
shared in nato

a major logjam was broken last week when the panel agreed on 
provisions of an outpatient prescription drug benefit to be 
provided under medicare for the first time 
but the basic foundation of the bill was laid months ago with a 
variety of provisions to protect americas 31 million medicare 
beneficiaries against the financial devastation of a prolonged 
acute illness 
despite the conference committee agreement some of the exact 
figures that will apply to individual medicare recipients will have 
to be added by technical experts before the final bill is printed 
for passage 
however the outofpocket deductible for doctor bills covered 
by medicare the amount paid by each recipient before government 
aid starts helping will wind up somewhere between 1320 a year 
and 1400 
the hospital benefit is already set full 365 dayayear 
coverage after a oneday deductible that rises along with average 
hospital costs the 1988 deductible is 540 
once fully implemented in 1993 the new prescription drug 
benefit will pay 80 percent of those costs after a 655 deductible 
by contrast medicare now pays no more than 80 percent of doctor 
bills no matter how high they climb and only 60 days of full 
hospital coverage after a oneday deductible 
the only prescription drugs now covered by medicare are a 
handful of particularly expensive ones such as antirejection 
medication for organ transplant patients

the organization of african unity 
marked its 25th anniversary wednesday with calls to unite to crush 
south african apartheid and to resolve africas 200 billion debt 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia the outgoing oau chairman 
celebrated the anniversary with a chorus of happy birthday 
oau as he cut a cake 
the african states declared our determination to be master of 
our own destiny in an 11page declaration marking the jubilee 
the states called for total political and economical liberation of 
the continent 
many of the 40 points in the declaration resembled previous oau 
resolutions the declaration offers no new plans of action 
it expressed disappointment at inadequate support provided 
by the international community despite promises to provide money to 
help africa put austerity programs into effect 
groups from sudan zambia guinea and algeria danced and sang as 
african leaders planted trees and unveiled a marble plaque with 
gold engraving of the organizations silver jubilee theme unity 
solidarity liberation development 
a helicopter gunship roared overhead but otherwise security was 
light for the more than 30 heads of government and state gathered 
at the 50member bodys headquarters in addis ababa ethiopias 
capital 
in zimbabwe which won independence eight years ago and is the 
oaus youngest member state the harare herald newspaper praised 
the organization as having played a key role in ending colonial 
domination prescribing ways of resolving the african debt and 
promoting regional cooperation in transport communications health 
programs and refugee care 
those attending the celebration in ethiopia included hosni 
mubarak of egypt who wore a dark suit jerry rawlings of ghana 
in camouflage fatigues and dark glasses sadiq elmahdi of sudan 
in flowing white robes and turban and maj gen ibrahim babangida 
of nigeria in khaki dress uniform emblazoned with red and gold 
braid 
kaunda said that although 19 african nations had achieved 
independence since the organizations founding may 25 1963 the 
oau should resist complacency 
africa must rise to strike the last blow against the racist 
regime of south africa to rid the continent of the last bastion of 
racism and colonialism he said we must therefore be even more 
united than before 
the celebration is followed by a threeday summit that begins 
thursday 
denunciation of south africa is a familiar theme at oau 
gatherings and summits which always end with calls to crush 
apartheid and with criticism of western governments for failing to 
impose mandatory sanctions on south africas whitedominated 
government 
the oau also calls regularly for the freeing of namibia which 
is under south african control 
at the same time black africa does about 1 billion a year in 
business with south africa much of it covertly 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp said in a 
commentary that the oau had failed to resolve the continents major 
problems 
there will be much south africabashing to cover up the lack 
of unity the social and economic crisis that plagues the continent 
and the heartrending suffering of the people of africa it 
said of the gathering 
oau secretarygeneral ide oumarou of niger said africas 
economic problems have weakened the organizations impact 
the words of a united africa would have been more resounding 
if its political and diplomatic influence had been matched by its 
economic power he said 
president mengistu haile mariam of ethiopia said the oau could 
count among its successes the rapprochement between ethiopia and 
somalia who restored diplomatic ties in april after an 11year 
break following the ogaden desert war 
the oau was not directly involved in the ethiopiasomalia 
rapprochement and has had limited success in mediation last year 
kaunda persuaded members chad and libya to accept a ceasefire in 
their territorial dispute after the united nations failed to do so 
president hissene habre of chad attended the oaus silver 
jubilee but col moammar gadhafi of libya stayed away from the 
meeting as he has in recent years

cbs officials said wednesday that getting the 
television rights to the 1992 winter olympics was the first step in 
rebuilding the beleaguered network and making it no 1 again 
its going to be a hard fight but were ready for an allout 
assault cbs president laurence tisch said 
the longtime ratings leader among the three major networks 
slipped to last place this season but tisch said the networks 
winning 243 million bid tuesday for the winter games in 
albertville france shows that cbs is determined to regain its 
former status 
were on the right track we just have to get the train 
moving faster he said at a news conference 
cbs which last televised the olympics in 1960 outbid nbc by 
68 million for the albertville games cbs sports president neal 
pilson said he expected cbs to make a small profit on the games 
but nbc sports president arthur watson said pilson was blowing 
smoke 
tisch also chief executive officer of cbs called the bid 
very realistic 
i think we can make money he said at worst i see us 
breaking even 
gene jankowski president of the cbs broadcast group said the 
bid reflected cbs new aggressiveness 
we are not the no 1 network but we intend to be he said 
we have promised our affiliates that we will go after the big 
events and thats what were doing

a newspaper said wednesday the army 
rejected a us proposal for gen manuel antonio noriega to step 
down because it did not guarantee his chosen president would remain 
in power 
the high command of the defense forces and the strategic 
military council rejected the points of conversation because they 
found no guarantee of the continuity of the constitutional mandate 
of president manuel solis palma said the progovernment la 
republica citing sources it did not identify 
the frontpage story carried the headline there is no 
agreement 
it said the military believed there would be security risks 
political confrontations among panamanians and that the us 
proposal would impede the process of turning over the panama canal 
treaties signed in 1977 require the united states to relinquish 
control of the canal on dec 31 1999 
the report in the afternoon paper said the military leaders felt 
any further talks should be held in a broader parameter in which 
other sectors of the panamanian state might be included 
secretary of state george shultz announced wednesday afternoon 
in washington that the talks had collapsed 
when the negotiations on noriegas removal began several weeks 
ago the united states insisted on retaining eric arturo delvalle 
as president that position appeared to have softened recently 
delvalle was deposed by noriega on feb 26 a day after the 
president tried to fire noriega the united states continues to 
recognize delvalles presidency 
there was no immediate public comment from noriega on the 
failure of the talks he is to address the legislative assembly on 
thursday said an assembly spokesman 
noriega the head of the 15000strong defense forces is under 
federal indictment in florida for drug trafficking removal of the 
indictments was reportedly part of the agreement that had been 
considered 
other terms were said to be lifting us economic sanctions 
noriegas departure from panama at least temporarily and agreement 
on who should head the civilian government until may 1989 elections 
sources close to romulo escobar betancourt noriegas chief 
negotiator with the united states told the associated press early 
wednesday that the two sides still had not reached agreement on 
what would happen to 50 million in panamanian funds frozen in 
american banks and on the status of solis palma whom noriega 
installed as president after deposing delvalle 
hours later shultz announced that the talks were off 
delvalle has been in hiding in panama since he was deposed and 
warrants are out for his arrest although the panamian government 
has made no serious recent attempt to find him 
the military has been the de facto ruler in this country of 22 
million since 1968 when gen omar torrijos ousted arnulfo arias 
madrid 
panamanianamerican relations have dropped in the past year to a 
25year low the us economic sanctions have taken a heavy toll on 
panamas economy 
international confidence in panamas banking industry has been 
shaken and scores of businesses have gone bankrupt or are 
struggling to stay open 
the opposition press has been silenced since early this year 
ricardo arias calderon president of panamas opposition 
christian democratic party said recently it may take a generation 
to restore panama to what it was economically and socially before 
the crisis

the japanese parliament on wednesday approved a new 
nuclear cooperation pact with the united states that the us 
congress had accepted earlier 
the 30year agreement allows japan to transfer spent nuclear 
fuel from the united states to reprocessing plants in britain and 
france without seeking us permission each time it was required 
to do so under a previous agreement 
the new accord also limits cooperation to peaceful purposes and 
allows japan to bring in americanmade nuclear materials including 
plutonium which can be used to make nuclear weapons 
during heated us congressional debate on the pact in march 
sen john glenn dohio expressed concern about potential risks of 
nuclear proliferation terrorism and environmental damage 
yozo hosokawa an official at the science and technology agency 
said the new pact will go into effect as early as fall

the soviet union announced wednesday for the first 
time how many casualties it suffered in afghanistan with a red 
army general telling a nationwide television audience that 13310 
soldiers died in the war 
gen alexei d lizichev also said 35478 soldiers were wounded 
and 311 are missing from the soviet unions 8year battle with 
moslem insurgents 
soviet soldiers began leaving their bases may 15 in accordance 
with a peace accord signed in geneva that aims to end foreign 
involvement in the afghan civil war and improve chances for 
internal resolution of the 10yearold conflict 
the general said in a news briefing which was also carried on 
the evening news program vremya that the death and injury tolls 
included casualties suffered between dec 27 1979 when soviet 
troops and tanks entered the war and may 1 the total of 49099 
dead wounded and missing was slightly higher than some western 
analysts estimated 
a us state department report last year estimated there had 
been 33000 to 38000 casualties about onethird of which were 
deaths 
lizichev said the soviet government would make every effort to 
learn the fate of the missing soldiers and indicated that there 
would be no barriers to the return of those who fell into the 
hands of the opposition or found themselves abroad he appeared 
to be referring to deserters as well as prisoners of war 
lizichevs casualty figures were in line with soviet journalist 
eduard rosentals statement may 19 that news reports estimating 
deaths between 12000 and 15000 were more or less correct 
the war in afghanistan often has been compared to us 
involvement in vietnam where about 58000 americans were killed 
and about 150000 were wounded 
since the withdrawal began 10 days ago 9500 soviet troops have 
left their bases as well as 1000 pieces of military equipment 
lizichev reported 
asked whether the departing forces had suffered any casualties 
the general replied that there had been attempts to prevent them 
from leaving but that there had been no marked increase in rebel 
attacks 
he declined to verify the size of the soviet contingent in 
afghanistan but western intelligence reports have indicated that 
prior to the start of the withdrawal about 115000 soviet soldiers 
were in afghanistan to back the government of president najib 
against anticommunist rebels 
lizichev and deputy foreign minister yuli m vorontsov held fast 
to the kremlin position that sending soviet troops into a 
neighboring countrys civil war was justified 
soviet troops had been invited to afghanistan by the 
government vorontsov said that is a fact this cannot be 
reassessed 
lizichev was asked whether soviet advisers would remain behind 
after the withdrawal is completed and replied that if the afghans 
appealed for such assistance we would consider this request 
najib told reporters in kabul last month that his government was 
counting on the continued help of soviet advisers 
vorontsov was asked whether the retreat signaled an end to the 
brezhnev doctrine former leader leonid i brezhnevs policy of 
military intervention to protect socialist revolutionary gains 
this was not our baby vorontsov said of the doctrine but 
he added that the soviet armed forces are committed to protecting 
allies as well as soviet territory 
lizichev said soviet policy has not changed that conditions 
appeared only recently that allowed the kremlin to leave the afghan 
troops to fight on their own 
soviet officials and the staterun media have cast the pullout 
as a successful conclusion to the war 
the unmediated geneva accords require all soviet soldiers to 
be out of afghanistan within nine months and half of the 
contingent to withdraw by aug 15 
ltgen boris gromov head of the afghanbased troops told 
reporters in kabul before the start of the withdrawal that 25 
percent of the soldiers would leave before president reagans visit 
to moscow which begins sunday 
earlier wednesday the afghan government charged for the fourth 
time in recent days that pakistan is violating provisions of the 
peace accord that prohibit arms transfers to the anticommunist 
rebels 
much of the weaponry supplied to the insurgents has come from 
the united states and vorontsov joked that some of the 
ussupplied stinger missiles provided to the rebels have been 
captured by soviet forces after claiming that the insurgents were 
selling the stingers to other countries for as much as 300000 
vorontsov said the kremlin had obtained some free of charge

a woman who said she had had it up to my nose 
with doctors and monitors with my children is under criminal 
investigation after she had four children die before the age of 4 
months officials said wednesday 
a family court judge ruled that bonnie lambert and her husband 
bruce were guilty of at the very least gross negligence and 
issued a finding of abuse of their only surviving child a 
10monthold boy who is currently in foster care 
one of the children who died had previously been held at a 
hospital because the citys special services for children 
department had received anonymous reports that the mother was 
killing her children for insurance money to sustain her drug habit 
judge judith sparrow said in her report 
brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman confirmed 
wednesday she was investigating the three deaths that occurred in 
her borough 
the circumstances under which these infants died are under 
investigation by my office this matter is being taken very 
seriously and is being investigated thoroughly holtzman said in 
a statement 
sparrow called the parents descriptions of how their children 
died inconsistent and incredible in the may 2 decision made 
public tuesday 
the decision was in response to a petition by the city alleging 
that the lamberts abused their surviving child bruce jr through 
reckless disregard for his care no specific acts of physical abuse 
were alleged a hearing to determine the childs future is 
scheduled for friday 
a call to the lamberts attorney jeffrey karan was not 
returned wednesday 
sparrows decision outlined the deaths of the four infants the 
report based on the lamberts testimony medical and social 
workers accounts and other records said 
kristen the couples first child died in august 1983 five 
weeks after birth in monticello ny of apparent natural causes 
the medical examiners report said the baby died of cardiac arrest 
and pneumonia 
a daughter heather was hospitalized three weeks after birth 
in june 1985 for an apnea disorder described as a tendency to stop 
breathing without cause she died in july at age 5 weeks just 1 
days after being released from the hospital 
the judge said maimonides hospital gave the lamberts a monitor 
to record heathers breathing and heart rate the parents testified 
they used the monitor but aspects of their description lacked 
veracity sparrow wrote 
heathers cause of death was given as sudden infant death 
syndrome but no autopsy was performed because the parents opposed 
it 
a third daughter erin was diagnosed as having drug withdrawal 
symptoms shortly after birth oct 10 1986 and doctors recommended 
that she be monitored for the apnea disorder she died feb 9 1987 
mrs lambert admitted she missed erins followup medical 
appointments and told the judge she had it up to my nose with 
doctors and monitors with my children the judges decision said 
erins cause of death was listed as sids but later changed to 
sudden unexplained death circumstances undetermined 
the last infant to die was jason the twin of surviving bruce 
jr sparrow said the twins were kept at a hospital after the 
childrens services department received the anonmymous reports that 
the mother had killed the children to collect insurance money 
the department had previously received such reports the judges 
decision said a social worker was assigned to the family after the 
third death and had been in contact with the parents 
the allegations of abuse were evidently not confirmed and the 
twins were released to the parents authorities said jason died 
last october with the cause of death listed as sids bruce jr was 
then placed in foster care 
the twins had infrequent bouts of apnea during their hospital 
stay but a doctor who handled the case said mrs lambert told him 
she did not plan to use monitors with them sparrow said 
the physician dr sheela laungani told the judge it was 
extremely rare for there to be multiple deaths in one family from 
sids 
the childs maternal grandparents have requested custody of the 
child said lenore gittis of the legal aid societys juvenile 
rights division

a 78yearold man who has never even 
received a traffic ticket now may go to prison for killing his 
ailing wife 
oscar carlson has admitted he shot and killed his wife agnes 
at a nursing home feb 29 but said he did so to end her suffering 
from alzheimers disease 
carlson pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder in exchange for a 
maximum 43month sentence the agreement departs from state 
sentencing guidelines which call for an 18year sentence for 
seconddegree murder 
still carlsons attorneys held out hope that during sentencing 
douglas county judge paul ballard would send the retired farmer to 
a nursing home where he could be cared for and receive counseling 
carlson has been free on bond 
he believes what he did was right said attorney michael 
dolan but over and above that i believe we have presented 
significant evidence to show the great pressure he was under from 
caring for her 
a hearing was held wednesday but a decision was delayed a day 
when the prosecutor said one witness could not appear until 
thursday 
douglas county attorney ann carrott had opposed even the 
43month sentence although she feels compassion toward carlson 
she said she believes sentencing guidelines should be followed 
she also presented a witness wednesday who suggested that mrs 
carlson had been abused by her husband 
the focus of the defense attorneys has been on the stress that 
oscar carlson was under and obviously there are some issues of the 
life of the victim and her general surroundings that i believe are 
just as important ms carrott said 
carlson testified last month during his sentencing hearing that 
his wife of nearly 47 years asked to be shot carlson said he shot 
her four times with a 22caliber pistol and then sat down to pray 
and watch her die 
the shooting occurred at the crestview manor nursing home in 
evansville a day after agnes carlson had broken a hip in a fall 
carlson testified that when he heard his wife who had suffered 
four years with alzheimers disease would require surgery my 
mind cracked 
i couldnt take no more he said 
relatives said they were crushed by mrs carlsons death but 
forgave carlson 
hes still our father and we understand it was hard on him 
said mildred penuel of fargo nd carlsons youngest daughter 
alzheimers is a disease thats very hard on the caretaker 
i hope that some good will come out of this and people will be 
a little more understanding of those who are caring for sufferers 
of alzheimers disease 
all three of carlsons daughters testified last month that they 
hoped their father would be shown leniency because of the strain he 
was under and his age 
were talking about a man whos never even had a traffic 
ticket before this said tom reif another attorney representing 
carlson i do not think sending him to prison at his age would 
serve society at all 
but during wednesdays hearing barbara walters director of the 
crestview nursing home testified that staff members became 
concerned about mrs carlson and the care she received when carlson 
took her out of the nursing home for brief visits at home 
she said staff members noticed bruises on mrs carlsons body 
after some of the visits after returning from one visit in august 
1987 mrs carlson told the staff im glad to be here that man 
really pounded on me mrs walters said reading from a nursing 
report 
on crossexamination by reif mrs walters said nursing 
officials were aware that mrs carlson bruised easily and 
sometimes because of her alzheimers said things that were 
untrue she said an investigation by the douglas county social 
services department determined that reports of alleged abuse were 
unfounded 
bonnie campeau administrator of the home also testified 
wednesday saying that carlson had complained to her on numerous 
occasions about the cost of mrs carlsons care

col moammar gadhafi on wednesday declared an end to 
libyas war with chad and said he now recognizes the chadian 
government libyan television reported 
the libyan leader also said that chadian prisoners will be 
handed over to the organization of african unity and that libya 
will resolve all its problems with chad in a friendly and 
fraternal way 
he made his remarks to african ambassadors in tripoli the 
libyan capital in a speech marking the 25th anniversary of the 
oau the address was broadcast by libyan television and monitored 
in london 
gadhafi has declared the chad war over before most recently in 
september 1987 
he said he was making his wednesday declaration so the 50nation 
oau which has been trying to resolve the libyachad dispute for 
12 years could concentrate on solving africas economic problems 
confronting racism in south africa supporting the palestinians 
and other issues 
a spokesman for chads delegation at the oau meeting in addis 
ababa ethiopia said wednesday night that president hissene habre 
of chad could not be reached for comment because of the late hour 
however the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
noted that habre said tuesday he was very optimistic about the 
possibility of resolving the dispute with libya 
gadhafi also used the occasion to declare unilaterally that 
libya will resume ties with eight african countries kenya 
liberia zaire mauritius gabon senegal gambia and ivory coast 
we want this day to be a day of joy for africa and a reduction 
in the burden of the organization so that it may devote itself to 
the historic objectives for which it was set up the unity of 
africa and the liberation of africa gadhafi said 
in order to salute and express appreciation for this day the 
day of africa the leadership of the libyan revolution wants to 
declare the following as a present to africa on the 25th 
anniversary libya declares its recognition of chad and ends all

entered chad in 1983 in support of rebels led by former chadian 
president goukouni queddei france the onetime colonial ruler of 
chad gave military support to habre who ousted goukouni in june 
1982 
habres forces pushed libyan troops out of chad early last year 
but chad and libya continued to dispute the mineralrich aouzou 
strip on chads extreme northern border an oau committe was set up 
to examine the issue 
gadhafi invited goukouni and habre to met in libya and said 
libya will do its utmost for the sake of national reconciliation 
between them 
he said that if chad does return to civil war libya announces 
that it will not intervene 
gadhafi said libya was offering what he described as a libyan 
marshall plan to reconstruct northern chad 
the marshall plan was set up by the united states to aid in 
european recovery after world war ii 
gadhafi also said that that under the libyan constitution the 
country did not to have a head of state and so his absence at the 
oau meeting should not offend that organization

president reagan dogged by a foreign 
policy problem he wanted to leave behind arrived here early 
thursday en route to a moscow summit with mikhail s gorbachev 
after proclaiming that superpower relations have come a long 
way since their 1985 faceoff in geneva 
less than an hour before air force one touched down secretary 
of state george p shultz in washington announced the collapse of 
negotiations to get panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
to relinquish power 
nevertheless reagan said i dont feel weakened by the 
foreign policy setback going into the summit 
the administration had hoped the long stalemate with noriega 
would be broken before reagan reaches moscow thus sparing him any 
embarrassment that would distract attention from the talks with 
gorbachev 
asked at a picturetaking session with finnish president mauno 
koivisto if he felt foolish about the noriega situation reagan 
replied i just dont feel that way 
in washington shultz announced the negotiations had reached an 
impasse and that the united states was withdrawing its offer to 
drop drug charges against noriega if he left the country 
reagan was upbeat as he left the white house on wednesday 
giving a mostly sunny assessment of relations between moscow and 
washington but he acknowledged that we have many differences 
deep differences 
there will be plenty of work for mr gorbachev and me in 
moscow next week reagan said i do not expect it to be easy 
reagan did not take with him a ratified intermediaterange 
nuclear forces or inf treaty but senate leaders said they hoped 
to win approval of the pact by weeks end so it can be rushed to 
moscow for a ceremonial exchange of treatyratification documents 
with gorbachev 
it was with much pomp that reagan and gorbachev signed the 
treaty during their last meeting in washington last december 
reagan planned to use the fourday helsinki stopover to prepare 
for the summit and to adjust to the eighthour time difference 
between moscow and washington 
he was greeted at the helsinkivantaa airport by koivisto and 
his wife tellervo 
spotlights flooded the tarmac and a red carpet was rolled out to 
air force one for reagans arrival 
reagan is scheduled to arrive in moscow at midafternoon sunday 
for a fourday summit expected to be short on substance and long on 
ceremony he had conceded beforehand that there was virtually no 
likelihood of a breakthrough on a longrange missile accord 
reagans trip marks the first visit to the soviet union by a 
sitting president since richard nixon and gerald ford made separate 
trips there in 1974 
reagan 77 has never visited the soviet union although he 
spent much of his long career speaking of americas challenges in 
the face of rising soviet power 
reflecting on his three previous summits with gorbachev 
beginning with the november 1985 meeting in geneva the president 
said in his remarks wednesday we have come a long way since 
then 
however he said we have many differences deep differences 
moral differences but we are still fellow human beings we can 
still work together to keep the peace 
the faceoff in moscow follows summits between reagan and 
gorbachev in geneva in reykjavik iceland in october 1986 and in 
washington last december reagan also has held out the possibility 
of a fifth gettogether later this year if the two sides are 
close to agreement on a strategic arms reduction treaty 
several hundred people including soviet ambassador yuri 
dubynin stood on the south lawn of the white house to hear the 
president make his departure remarks as aides held umbrellas over 
him and the first lady 
but the umbrella failed to keep the president dry mrs reagan 
was overheard remarking to him honey youre just soaked he 
answered i know it she then asked why didnt you put on a 
raincoat his answer could not be heard 
as the brief ceremony ended the navys blue angels precision 
flight team staged a lowaltitude flyby 
reagan outlined high expectations for the summit with the 
caveat that i do not expect it to be easy 
reagan said he will press gorbachev for continued human rights 
improvements for help in ending conflicts in angola namibia and 
central america and for assistance to prevent a manmade crisis of 
starvation in ethiopia 
he gave a laundry list of superpower accomplishments in recent 
years including the mediumrange missile treaty and said he could 
supply more evidence of improved relations but id miss my 
plane 
my task next week will be to go still farther farther in the 
interests of peace farther toward a universal respect for 
fundamental human rights farther toward world freedom farther 
toward a safer world for all people he said 
we will urge the soviets to help move the middle east peace 
process closer to a just and lasting solution reagan said and 
we will look for ways to help the parties resolve other regional 
conflicts in africa asia and yes central america 
reagan will spend three days relaxing in helsinki making final 
summit preparations and trying to adjust to the eighthour time 
difference in moscow 
the reagans will stay in a thirdfloor suite of a plush guest 
house equipped with a small indoor pool and sauna it is located in 
a suburb about a 15minute drive from downtown helsinki 
soon after his arrival in moscow on sunday reagan and gorbachev 
will begin their first round of talks at the kremlin 
both nations say it will be impossible to wrap up a treaty next 
week to curb strategic nuclear weapons but officials on both sides 
say they hope to make progress in ironing out some obstacles in 
hopes an agreement will be completed before reagan leaves office 
next january 
shultz said the united states will make new proposals to keep 
track of mobile missiles one of the key disputes blocking a treaty

sign tuesday for their father who moved his family from 
philadelphia earlier this month and spent their 1500 savings in 
the process

inspired an outpouring of 20 bills and sympathy 
i saw those two kids there and i just started crying said 
hallandale postal worker alicia mcloughlin 36 who gave the 
childrens father bill cannon 3 in coins it was all i had 
she said before returning 30 minutes later to give him two 20 
bills 
in two hours cannon collected 135 and the promise of a days 
work saturday for 100 
even police contributed but the officer who pushed 5 into 
cannons hand refused to be identified 
state social workers were not touched they told cannon his 
children should have been in school where they have been registered 
youre doing a dangerous thing having these kids out here 
said social worker brenda miller you shouldnt be playing upon 
the emotions of people with these kids 
cannon said he would not use the girls to seek work again 
i just want to get on my feet he said 
cannon his wife bonnie 27 shirley michelle sister samantha

israeliallied militiamen backed by 
israeli air strikes stormed guerrilla bases in south lebanon on 
wednesday proiranian guerrillas reported 25 of their fighters 
killed and 20 missing 
police also said four israeli helicopter gunships rocketed the 
palestinian refugee camp ein elhilweh on sidons outskirts late 
wednesday killing a plo guerrilla and wounding four 
the helicopters dropping parachute flares destroyed a base of 
the mainstream fatah guerrilla faction of yasser arafats palestine 
liberation organization in the 1005 pm 405 pm edt strike 
police said 
the israeli army command in jerusalem later announced that 
israeli warplanes hit the ein elhilweh base at about 11 pm and 
scored accurate hits despite antiaircraft fire 
despite discrepancies the israeli and the lebanese accounts 
apparently were referring to the same air strike 
earlier in the day hezbollah or party of god irans main ally 
in lebanon said 25 of its men were killed in a daylong sweep by 
the south lebanon army militia supported by israeli helicopter 
gunships 
a hezbollah statement issued in beirut said 17 guerillas were 
wounded and 20 were missing the predominantly christian sla said 
five of its fighters were injured 
the assault on three villages in south lebanon began at daybreak 
and ended at nightfall when the attacking force rolled back to its 
base in israels selfdesignated security zone the slas voice 
of the south radio station said 
lebanon instructed its un mission to lodge a strong worded 
complaint against the israelisponsored aggression with the 
security council an official statement said 
the action in the south came as hezbollah concentrated its 
efforts on the battle for control of shiite moslem slums in south 
beirut 
syria reportedly warned hezbollah not to harm any of the 18 
foreign hostages including nine americans believed held in the 
slums site of a bloody 20day battle between hezbollah and the 
prosyrian amal militia 
the beirut newspaper annahar said syria told hezbollah that 
harming any of the hostages would be viewed as an infringement of 
syrias security 
it gave no source for its report and did not elaborate syrian 
spokesmen declined comment 
the captive held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was captured on march 16 
1985 
a belgian physician dr jan cools was reported missing 
wednesday in south lebanon but there was no word on whether he had 
been kidnapped 
the norwegian aid committee said cools 32 a general 
practitioner left the qasimiyeh refugee camp on saturday heading 
for the rashidiyeh shantytown eight miles to the south he never 
reached rashidiyeh 
on tuesday hezbollah consolidated its grip on more than 90 
percent of south beirut 
syrian troops and tanks surround the slums and syria has 
threatened to move in and stop the battle 
lebanons acting prime minister salim hoss drove to damascus 
for a meeting with vice president abdulhalim khaddam of syria 
sources close to hoss said he asked that the syrian army be sent 
into the slums and that hussein husseini speaker of lebanons 
parliament was expected to make a similar plea 
syria is tehrans main arab ally but has been alarmed by irans 
attempt through hezbollah to dominate lebanons 12 million 
shiites the largest sect in the country 
the intensity of the south beirut slum war decreased 
significantly wednesday with only automatic weapons fire reported 
police said they had no word on casualties 
the fighting has killed 296 people and wounded 1000 since may 6 
a police spokesman said hezbollah was reorganizing its forces 
apparently preparing for a final push against shiyah amals 
last stronghold in the 16 square miles of slums

an attorney for gen manuel antonio noriega says he 
isnt convinced talks are off between the indicted panamanian 
leader and us officials despite secretary of state george 
shultzs statement to that effect wednesday 
ive heard that only from the secretary of state and i 
remember hearing the secretary of state say that last march neal 
sonnett said after the shultz announcement 
that was followed by more negotiations over the last 10 days 
so i dont think it would be useful to comment on whether the 
negotiations are at a permanent end or not said sonnett one of 
several miami attorneys for noriega who faces drug indictments in 
miami and tampa 
the federal prosecutors who brought those indictments last 
february remain eager to meet him him in court rather than have 
charges dropped in a poltical deal in which noriega would give up 
power 
i stand ready to prosecute mr noriega said robert merkle 
us attorney in tampa 
however getting the defendant to florida to stand trial wont 
be easy because noriega cannot be extradited by the united states 
i offered him a trip to disney world but i dont think hell 
take me up on that merkle said 
merkles successful prosecution of colombian drug kingpin carlos 
lehder rivas took place after lehder was captured in a colombian 
jungle and immediately flown to tampa 
noriega is charged in a 12count indictment in miami with taking 
at least 46 million in payoffs from the violent medellin drug 
cartel led by lehder and others 
the threecount tampa indictment accused noriega of helping 
smuggle 1 million pounds of marijuana 
both merkle and leon kellner us attorney in miami were 
opposed to dropping their drug charges against noriega in exchange 
for his giving up power in panama 
all i can say is we are prepared to go forward with the case 
and we will do so kellner said declining further comment 
but sonnett said he thought charges against his client could 
well be dismissed and not necessarily as a result of negotiations 
i have continued to work on our motion for dismissal of the 
indictment on legal grounds and we will continue to do so he 
said we still feel that we have a strong case for dismissal on a 
variety on various grounds

a boeing 737 that lost all power and made an 
emergency landing on a narrow canal bank was battered by hail but 
possible fuel problems were also being examined officials said 
wednesday 
the taca international jet carrying about 40 passengers lost 
power in both its engines twice tuesday afternoon about 20 miles 
from new orleans international airport the pilot set the plane 
safely down between a drainage ditch and the intracoastal waterway 
as far as we know this is the first successful offairport 
deadstick no power landing of a commercial jet said warren 
wandel national transportation safety board inspector 
wandel said it was too early to tell if the rough weather had 
caused both jet engines to lose power 
we have to look at the commonality of both engines losing 
power so it could be a fuel problem wandel said 
jo johnson an ntsb investigator in fort worth texas had 
said earlier wednesday that the planes engines could have suffered 
damage from hail while the jet passed through a storm front along 
most of the gulf coast region 
but wandel said an initial inspection of the engine turbines did 
not suggest hail damage as the cause of their failure he said the 
plane had approximately 12800 pounds of fuel on board leading 
investigators to believe the problem could have been fuel 
contamination 
he also would not rule out the possibility that lightning hit 
the plane and said it would be several months before the ntsb 
releases a report on a probable cause 
examination of the plane could be finished by friday wandel 
said and then officials must decide how to remove it from the 
canal bank he said the plane could either be flown off the grassy 
strip or moved by barge along the intracoastal waterway to new 
orleans lakefront airport 
johnson said flying it out would be better 
i suspect theyll probably grade the strip down and fly it 
out later johnson said 
federal and airline officials have not confirmed the number of 
people aboard the plane but have placed the figure at 36 to 45 
taca is based in san salvador el salvador but has business 
offices in new orleans 
the pilot identified as carlos dardano landed the jet on the 
narrow strip on the grounds of the national aeronautics and space 
administrations michoud facility in eastern new orleans after it 
twice lost power in both engines 
the plane was at 11000 feet when the engines died the first 
time the control tower at new orleans international diverted the 
plane to the us naval air station at suburban belle chasse 15 
miles away 
the pilot then managed to restart both engines an faa source 
said and asked for clearance to land at new orleans international 
however the planes power failed again at about 5000 feet and 
the pilot was directed to the small but less congested lakefront 
airport about six miles away the faa source said 
the pilot responded with two mayday messages and began 
looking for somewhere else to land the source said 
saidy duran 35 a vacationing teacher at the national 
university in costa rica said she and other passengers showed 
their appreciation for the captains work with a round of applause 
a big one 
dardano of san salvador has been with taca about five years 
messina said adding hes a pretty cool captain he doesnt get 
flustered very easily

a record company executive a reputed mob 
figure and a third man were convicted wednesday on federal 
conspiracy charges in a case authorities called an example of 
organized crime influence in the recording industry 
morris levy president of roulette records and two associates 
howard fisher and dominick canterino were convicted of two counts 
each of conspiring to commit extortion 
they were charged with an attempted shakedown of john lamonte of 
darby pa who ran a record wholesale company in a 1985 dispute 
over 125 million in records and tapes from mca records inc of 
los angeles mca has not been charged in the case 
after a threeweek trial the jury deliberated about 4 hours 
over two days before convicting levy 60 of new york city fisher 
60 the comptroller of roulette records and canterino 57 whom 
law enforcement officials described as a member of the genovese 
organized crime family 
attorneys for the defendants said they would appeal the verdicts 
federal judge stanley s brotman whose district includes darby 
scheduled sentencing for july 8 each defendant faces a maximum 
sentence of 40 years in prison 
assistant us attorney bruce repetto said the government won 
its case on the merits of hours of taped conversations obtained by 
government wiretaps at levys office and other locations 
we didnt offer a whole lot beyond the tapes repetto said 
after opening statements in the case repetto told brotman the 
government would prove that the case involved reputed mob ties 
the organized crime element is there repetto said 
fbi documents filed in the case said government agencies 
believed levy a selfmade millionaire has been involved with 
organized crime for 20 years 
but brotman ordered prosecutors not to discuss organized crime 
connections during the course of the trial 
repetto in a meeting with reporters following the verdict 
declined to comment on whether the jury drew conclusions that 
organized crime played a role in the case 
mr canterino did not drop in from mars said repetto who 
asked the judge to raise bail on canterino and levy from 500000 
to 5 million cash 
its been reported that mr levy wishes to go to australia 
repetto told the judge while describing canterino as a highranking 
member of the conspiracy 
the judge ordered bail for canterino and levy to be raised to 1 
million that will be secured by a 15 million farm belonging to 
levy 
defense attorneys assured the judge the men would turn in their 
passports to the us attorneys office in newark and would not 
apply for new passports 
he isnt going anywhere levys attorney martin london 
told the judge 
during the trial the defense attacked record wholesaler 
lamontes credibility calling the man an excon with a history of 
criminal activity 
lamonte who served 18 months in prison for a 1977 conviction 
for bootlegging records agreed to wear a wiretap while meeting 
with the three men over an 18month period he did not testify in 
this case however 
lamonte and his business were the victims of this extortion 
repetto said 
defense attorneys also alleged through the trial that one of 
lamontes three partners in record wholesale firm was gaetano 
vastola a reputed member of a new jersey organized crime family 
vastola and three codefendants go on trial this fall before 
brotman on federal rackeetering charges related to the levy case 
repetto said

graduation ceremonies at the us military academy in west 
point ny and the naval academy in annapolis md were both 
marked wednesday by rainy skies and warnings not to underestimate 
the soviets 
it may be cold and blustery out here but this ceremony will 
be a warm and friendly one rear adm ronald f marryott naval 
academy superintendent told the thousands gathered in navymarine 
corps memorial stadium to watch graduation exercises for the class 
of 1988 as a light rain began to fall 
the academys class of 1041 graduates included 77 women 46 
hispanics 38 blacks 36 orientals two native americans and seven 
citizens of six foreign nations 
immediately after receiving their diplomas 855 of the graduates 
were sworn in as navy ensigns nd 174 as marine corps 2nd 
lieutenants five graduates will become 2nd lieutenants in the air 
force and the foreign students will return home 
defense secretary frank c carlucci told the graduates that the 
united states welcomes signs of change in the soviet union but must 
remain aware that mikhail gorbachevs reforms could mask a 
resurgence of soviet military power 
the departure of president reagan today for the summit 
demonstrates a commitment to explore all reasonable avenues to 
lessen the tensions that divide us he said 
if gorbachevs goal is to change soviet society in a way that 
makes it less aggressive in its expansionist policies then we will 
all have gained said carlucci on the other hand if the west 
heeds the siren call and relaxes its security guard only to awaken 
to a rebirth of soviet military power based on a modernized and 
technologically advanced industrial base then we will have made an 
enormous miscalculation 
carlucci called reagans proposed strategic defense initiative 
popularly known as star wars the first major step in reversing 
nuclear military capabilities from an offensive to a defensive 
force he predicted the navy will play a greater role in the 
militarys space involvement 
imaginative thinking is under way he said as can be seen 
in proposals to use naval platforms to launch replacement 
satellites in the event of a conflict thus the navy will 
unquestionably adapt to the nations changing defense requirements 
he also recommended us policy makers carefully construct our 
security relationship with japan korea and china countries he 
predicted would exert greater economic and political influences on 
the world in the future 
at west point the us military academy graduated its 190th 
class sending 939 new junior officers into the armed forces 
vice president george bush former chief justice warren burger 
and lt gen dave r palmer weest point superintendent handed out 
diplomas to 849 men and 90 women in a raindrenched ceremony at 
michie stadium 
in the commencement address bush criticized what he called the 
liberal elite who he said never understood that the soviet 
union must be dealt with from strength 
they are so blinded by ideology that they cannot see what 
americans have understood for 40 years that peace flows from 
strength the republican presidential aspirant said in what was 
billed as a nonpolitical speech 
political campaigning is prohibited at military installations 
the vice president told the cadets that it was a good thing that 
the united states and soviet union engaged in summit meetings but 
he said americans must not become complacent about the soviet 
threat just because the two sides were talking 
he said the times require leadership that will pursue 
negotiations with the soviet realistically 
douglas fraley 21 of irondale ohio was at the top of the 
class finishing with the best academic record and also winning a 
rhodes scholarship the class boasted a second rhodes scholar john 
nagl 22 of omaha neb 
the class goat was michael klee 22 of el paso texas too 
much socializing and not enough studying was klees explanation 
for his finishing at the bottom academically 
the goat is not formally designated by the academy and the 
identity of the cadet who squeaked through becomes known only 
because of the extraloud cheers when his name is read he also is 
slipped a bag of money collected by classmates relieved at having 
escaped his fate

antiamerican sentiment expressed by 
radical south korea students is not shared by the mainstream a 
senior government official said wednesday 
an influential newspaper on wednesday meanwhile accused the 
united states of meddling in south korean affairs but opposed 
calls for expulsion of us troops 
hyun hongchoo minister of legislation said we are 
confident the majority of the people are happy with our relations 
with the united states 
he was commenting at a lunch with the press about a wave of 
antigovernment and antiamerican demonstrations in south korean 
cities in the past week 
referring to calls by some radicals for the us army to 
relinquish its operational control of the south korean army hyun 
said the government feels there should be changes as time 
progreses and situations change 
the united states has 42000 troops based in south korea under a 
mutual defense pact a us general heads the combined military 
forces 
the newspaper chosun ilbo said in an editorial that south 
koreans resent us interference in domestic politics and economy 
in a highhanded manner its support for dictatorship and coercive 
demands to open korean markets 
radicals contend the united states has supported military rule 
in south korea and encourages the continued division of the korean 
peninsula the peninsula was divided in 1945 into communist north 
korea and prowestern south korea 
the recent antius criticism apparently indicates students 
and dissidents are mounting a major antius campaign aimed at the 
removal of us troops chosun ilbo said 
but the newspaper backed the presence of the american troops it 
called on koreans to maintain critical but balanced views of the 
united states instead of blind opposition 
the editorials criticism of the united states was quite unusual 
for the south korean press 
student protesters claim south korea is not a democracy as they 
did during the authoritarian regime of president roh taewoos 
predecessor and ally chun doohwan 
roh was elected last december in south koreas first direct 
elections in 16 years

tallahassee fla ap the lawmaker proposing a statewide 
coolingoff period for handgun sales wednesday withdrew a version 
of his bill weakened by legislators he accused of knuckling under 
to the national rifle association 
i cannot personally allow the bill in its current posture to 
come out with my name on it said rep ron silver a democrat 
from north miami beach 
the national rifle association is a very powerful financially 
secure organization and the legislature is responding more to the 
national rifle association than to the people of florida 
silver distributed a memo to the other 119 house members 
decrying a tuesday vote that reduced his proposed weeklong waiting 
period to three working days at the option of each county the 
proposed constitutional amendment would have been put to voters in 
a november referendum 
state law already allows counties to enact waiting periods of up 
to two days 
a lobbyist for the nra dismissed silvers claims that the 
association was improperly influencing lawmakers 
he knows thats not true said marion hammer director of 
the unified sportsmen of florida the nras florida arm theres 
no hue and cry out there for waiting periods he only wants to 
let the people decide if he can pick the question whos fooling 
who 
silver said he will mount a petition drive to place the 
sevenday question on the ballot anyway which will require him to 
collect several hundred thousand signatures of registered voters 
across the state by august 
if that drive succeeds and voters adopt the constitutional 
amendment silver said he would push separate legislation to 
require gun buyers to sign their intent to purchase weapons the 
current 48hour waiting period which several counties have 
enacted has been faulted because it doesnt require written intent 
to purchase a weapon 
rep ron johnson who sponsored the amendment to weaken silvers 
proposal as well as last years controversial law that made it 
easier for floridians to carry concealed weapons responded to 
silvers memo by telling his colleague i find it personally 
offensive

a us negotiating effort to induce panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega to go into exile this summer 
collapsed wednesday and no further talks are planned secretary of 
state george p shultz announced 
at the final moment in negotiations noriega would not carry 
through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated 
shultz told a hastilyarranged news conference 
no offers remain on the table he said 
under secretary of state michael armacost told reporters that 
noriega had indicated that majors and captains within panamas 
defense forces might take strong action against him if he 
agreed to the deal 
the united states has been seeking noriegas removal since his 
indicment in february by a federal grand jury in miami on charges 
of taking at least 46 million in payoffs from colombias medellin 
cartel to protect cocaine shipments launder money and hide drug 
smugglers from law enforcement officials 
the collapse of the talks came as president reagan was flying to 
helsinki finland on the first leg of his summit meeting in moscow 
next week with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
upon arrival reagan was asked at a picturetaking session with 
finnish president mauno koivisto whether he felt his hand had been 
weakened on the eve of the summit i dont feel weakened he 
said 
republicans and democrats on capitol hill welcomed the 
development sending noriega off into retirement with a legal 
golden parachute would have been the wrong step at the wrong 
time said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
the key provisions of the proposed agreement called for 
noriegas resignation in august as defense force commander his 
departure from panama and in exchange the dismissal of us drug 
smuggling indictments against him 
the goal was to remove noriega from the panamanian political 
scene as the country moved toward civilianled rule with 
presidential elections in may 1989 
shultz indicated that the two countries now appear to be back to 
square one 
all proposals addressed during these negotiations have been 
withdrawn he said 
attorney general edwin meese iii said in a statement that 
noriega is a fugitive and the us government will use every 
legal means at our disposal to bring him to justice to remove him 
from power and to restore democracy to panama 
the us negotiating plan had drawn considerable bipartisan 
opposition at home and from antinoriega forces in panama as well 
among the critics was democratic presidential front runner michael 
dukakis 
vice president george bush in a break with reagan said he if 
elected president would not negotiate with reputed drug dealers 
either domestic and foreign the senate approved 8610 a resolution 
criticizing the proposed dismissal of the drug charges against 
noriega 
throughout the state department view was that dismissal of the 
indictments against noriega was a small price to pay for his 
departure from panama and the restoration of democratic rule 
the negotiations reached the doordie stage starting on monday 
when state department envoy michael g kozak returned to panama 
after two days of consultations in washington 
us officials said wednesday morning that agreement seemed to 
be in hand but kozak telephoned the department at 4 pm edt to say 
that noriega had rejected the plan 
shultz said the administration expects to work with latin 
american democracies in hopes of seeking a solution 
he said the united states will continue to work with the 
people of panama to get noriega out of panama but he offered 
no details of how that might be accomplished 
he refused comment when asked if military solutions are being 
contemplated but at the pentagon officials insisted there were no 
plans afoot for direct military intervention in panama 
the officials who agreed to discuss the matter only if not 
identified also said the roughly 11000 american troops in panama 
had not been placed on any special alert 
shultz said that noriega backed away from the proposal when he 
saw that it got him out of panama and it got him out of power 
shultz said the united states would continue to recognize ousted 
president arturo eric delvalle as the legitimate leader of panama 
rather than president manuel solis palma the nominal leader 
approved by noriega 
in panama a progovernment newspaper said panamas military 
rejected the proposed accord because the plan would not guarantee 
that solis palma remained in power 
the high command of the defense forces and the strategic 
military council rejected the points of conversation because they 
found no guarantee of the continuity of the constitutional mandate 
of president manuel solis palma said the progovernment 
afternoon daily la republica citing unidentified sources 
us attorney leon kellner who obtained the indictment against 
noriega in miami said after shultzs announcement we are 
prepared to go forward with the case and we will do so 
neal sonnett one of noriegas four miami lawyers said he 
believes the miami indictment against his client could well be 
dismissed 
i have continued to work on our motion for dismissal of the 
indictment on legal grounds and we will continue to do so we still 
feel that we have a strong case for dismissal on a variety on 
various grounds sonnett said 
shultz had planned to accompany reagan when he left washington 
wednesday morning for helsinki 
but shultz stayed behind to monitor the panama situation 
delaying his departure for finland until early evening

tom bird was 19 years old when he first saw 
vietnam in 1965 
this is paradise he remembers saying as he looked down from 
an airplane at a pristine beach there cant be a war here 
some 23 years later the image of that paradise still haunts 
him so do images of the vietnam war a conflict he experienced 
first hand as a member of the battered first cavalry division 
in walking point a vietnam voyage now on view at 
offbroadways samuel beckett theater bird tries to reconcile the 
two memories his reconciliation forms the core of walking 
point a harrowing yet hopeful tale of vietnam that eloquently 
tries to explain the hold this strange wonderous country had and 
still has over the american servicemen who fought there 
in walking point bird founder and artistic director of the 
vietnam veterans ensemble theater company sits alone on stage and 
talks for some 80 minutes about his visits to southeast asia in 
the fervent almost monotone voice of a true believer he tells the 
audience about three trips he made to vietnam after the war ended 
birds postwar journeys including one he made with performance 
artist and clown bill irwin become vivid travelogues he describes 
a calm strangely tranquil vietnam no longer divided into north 
and south theres a visit to a water puppet show in hanoi a 
magical almost mystical experience that suddenly brings back 
horrific memories of the war and there are profiles of various 
guides and interpreters men who a few years before were part of 
the enemy 
the juxtaposition of past and present never is far from the 
surface in any of birds stories they overlap when bird travels 
south to saigon he cant bring himself to call it ho chi minh 
city to visit places he saw during the war 
he finds the city alive and vibrant full of reminders of an 
american presence that left abruptly more than a decade ago there 
are the fading signs in english proclaiming us military 
installations there is the burned hulk of an american tank that 
sets bird wondering about who were the soldiers who died in its 
wreckage and there are the amerasian children the questioning 
faces of the young who bear the unmistakable imprint of america 
what finally makes the evening such a moving and unsettling 
experience is birds extraordinary feeling for vietnam it embodies 
love hate and just about every emotion in between 
but walking point never sinks into despair even though 
birds story is melancholy and at times painfully sad maybe 
thats because its author wont give up hes a determined 
storyteller who wont stop talking until he understands why it all 
happened and what have been consequences of americas attempt to 
save vietnam from communism

the wonder years now playing at offbroadways village 
gate may be the first musical built entirely on name and product 
recognition 
virtually every pop icon and every fad from the 1950s and 60s 
are mentioned in this mild little revue that examines the baby boom 
generation from birth to the year 2018 the 50th anniversary of 
woodstock they are all here from lucy riccardo to mr and dr 
spock from hula hoops to the watusi from wally cleaver to 
polaroid swingers 
the music and lyrics by david levy are as unsurprising as the 
cast which is headed by the always cheerful lenny wolpe he plays 
an irritating character named skippy billed as the first babyboom 
baby born one minute after midnight on jan 1 1946 
at least wolpe is enthusiastic but the wonder years is as 
bland as the white bread it celebrates

unesco chief federico mayor on wednesday proposed 
slashing programs and reining in spending to woo back the united 
states and other exmembers but ran into opposition from soviet 
bloc and third world nations 
the directorgeneral said the 158nation organization faced 
new challenges that required fresh solutions and called for 
reduction of unescos 16 major programs to five and of its 60 
general programs to 16 
mayors plan officially called a sketch to indicate that it 
could be considerably modified proposed austerity measures aimed 
at saving 8 million it called for shorter conferences reduced 
travel and controls on document production 
the parisbased united nations educational scientific and 
cultural organization should do fewer things but do them better 
with fewer activities and more followup mayor said adding 
that the agency had to be more visible in order to be more 
credible 
mayor elected to head unesco in november outlined the 
preliminary plan to members of the 51nation executive board at the 
start their threeweeklong spring meeting 
on monday the spanish scientist said he was asking the united 
states britain and singapore to rejoin unesco 
the united states and britain which paid 30 percent of unescos 
budget pulled out in 1984 and 1985 to protest the organizations 
alleged antiwestern bias and squandering of resources the unesco 
budget was 2893 million for 198687 
mayor had described his proposals as provocative and likely 
to stimulate a major debate at unesco 
in fact some members found them so disturbing that the agenda 
was changed at the last minute so that mayor could present his plan 
at the opening session instead of monday of next week as scheduled 
the group of 77 third world countries circulated a paper sharply 
critical of the plan which they said treated them as objects for 
whose benefits activities have been proposed rather than as actors 
and equal partners 
it said the proposals do not reflect the wishes of the member 
states and should be redrafted and presented at the boards 1989 
spring meeting 
another indication of the tough sledding mayors plan will face 
came from indian delegate swaran singh 
he said the document contained contradictions and that it dealt 
in terms of concepts and not real problems and played down the role 
of governments 
singh called for restoration of one of the dropped programs that 
deals with peace and development and the struggle for human rights 
and against discrimination 
polish delegate kazimiierz zygulski said there was an 
obsession with change and efficiency in mayors proposals we 
cant be just a pragmatic organization we have to have specific 
goals he said 
in opening the meeting board president jose israel vargas of 
brazil praised the orginality freshness and broadness of view 
in mayors proposals 
mayor said the agency should concentrate on five major areas 
education natural science culture communications and social 
science 
he has promised to consult intellectuals artists scientists 
educators and journalists before preparing a final version of the 
plan 
during his presentation mayor made no reference to unescos 
controversial plan to establish a new world information and 
communication order which has been sharply criticized by western 
governments and news media organizations 
in speeches to media professionals last week in rome and 
istanbul turkey mayor said he favored a new phase at unesco 
that would allow a free and uninhibited flow of information

district of punjab and raised to at least 1171 the number of 
people killed by extremists in the northern indian state since the 
year began the toll for all of 1987 was 1030 killed 
police meanwhile reported that municipal workers recovered human 
skeletons wednesday from sikhisms holiest shrine the golden 
temple 
the amritsar city police superintendent baldev singh said two 
skeletons of a man and a woman were pulled from under the debris 
inside the temple complex by city laborers 
these are the remains of people tortured and then killed by 
sikh terrorists singh told the associated press 
there are more such skeletons we are trying to bring them 
out 
sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an 
independent homeland in punjab since 1982 singh said the radicals 
often tortured people they suspected to be police informers 
police and paramilitary forces surround the golden temple where 
a 10day siege ended last week after militants inside were forced 
to surrender the temple was opened to the public for the first 
time monday

aldermen in the nations thirdlargest city 
approved an ordinance wednesday that sponsors said would bar 
smoking in most public areas and force restaurant owners and 
employers to set aside smoking sections 
new york and los angeles the first and secondlargest cities 
already have smoking restrictions 
those of you who want to die do it yourselves declared 
anna langford one of 33 city council members who voted for the 
ordinance eight voted against it 
law enforcement officials would be better placed trying to 
chase criminals than smokers said alderman edward burke in 
speaking against the ordinance whose quick passage surprised even 
some supporters 
mayor eugene sawyer a smoker favors the ban said aide monroe 
anderson 
we thought the vote was going to be closer and he was 
prepared to break the tie and vote for it the mayor smokes but he 
has cut back dramatically he never smokes in public anderson 
said 
the ordinance bans smoking entirely in enclosed public areas 
like meeting rooms and taxicabs and requires restaurants with 40 
seats or more to set aside smoking and nonsmoking areas said 
alderman raymond figueroa the ordinances main sponsor he said 
the amount of designated restaurant space would be based on the 
percentage of smoking and nonsmoking clientele 
bars and private meeting rooms would be exempt from the ban 
in addition figueroa said employers must designate smoking and 
nosmoking areas if workers request them nosmoking signs must be 
posted in all designated areas he said 
the ordinance which takes effect in 60 days carries fines 
ranging from 25 to 100 
chicago has to line up with the rest of the major cities we 
have been lagging figueroa said 
a state house committee blocked legislation in late april to 
restrict smoking in most public places in illinois even though the 
proposal had been watered down to appease business groups similar 
legislation has been introduced annually in recent years without 
success 
los angeles smoking ban the citys fifth antismoking 
legislation since 1964 went into effect in january it bans 
smoking in indoor sports arenas concert halls stores not 
specializing in tobacco products transportation terminals day 
care centers and most private schools restaurants seating more 
than 50 would be required to reserve more than half their seats for 
nonsmokers 
new yorks antismoking law one of the toughest in the nation 
went into effect last month although small establishments are 
exempt the bill forbids smoking inside sports arenas theaters 
banks hospitals and taxis it limits smoking in offices 
restaurants and hotel lobbies smoking has been limited in all city 
buildings since june 1986 
when the new york legislation passed health officials said 
about 150 cities had enacted some kind of smoking restriction 
legislation

the government on wednesday opened another 
front in a us effort to boost sales of american oranges and 
orange juice in japan 
us trade representative clayton yeutter announced that he has 
accepted a florida citrus industry petition for a formal 
investigation of japanese restrictions on orange and juice imports 
as unfair trade practices 
the restrictions include import quotas and a requirement that 
imported juice be blended with homegrown juice 
yeutters office already is pursuing the orange dispute at other 
levels after months of unsuccessful negotiations with the japanese 
government it moved earlier this month to have the japanese orange 
import quotas along with those on beef imports declared illegal 
under international trading rules by gatt the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
any of the cases could culminate in formal us retaliation 
against japanese products or official demands for compensation for 
lost sales 
yeutter said in a statement the united states already is 
aggressively moving on two different fronts to resolve the 
citrus and beef disputes with japan 
in the coming weeks we will vigorously pursue our gatt case 
he said while at the same time making additional efforts to 
resolve the dispute directly with tokyo where a us delegation 
has been meeting with japanese agriculture ministry officials 
if those efforts do not lead to a satisfactory resolution of 
the matter or if japan obstructs the gatt process the us could 
retaliate against any violation by japan of its gatt obligations 
or any unfair unreasonable or discriminatory japanese government 
practice that limits access to its citrus market yeutter added 
the florida citrus industry which petitioned may 6 to get the 
japanese restrictions declared unfair contends that lifting them 
would cut by onethird the prices japanese consumers must pay for 
oranges yeutter noted 
yeutters office had 45 days to decide whether to accept the 
industry petition for an investigation but it took only 19 days if 
the office finds that unfair practices do exist and the dispute 
cannot be resolved through negotiations or the gatt machinery it 
recommends action to the president 
the petition was filed under section 301 of the 1974 trade act 
which also authorizes investigations on the governments own 
initiative 
organizations joining in the florida petition were the florida 
citrus mutual the florida citrus packers the florida citrus 
processors association the florida department of citrus and the 
indian river citrus league 
elimination of the barriers they said could boost annual us 
exports to japan to 300000 metric tons compared with 1987 sales 
of 126000 tons of fresh oranges and 8500 tons of juice 
japan buys more american farm products than any other country 
but disagreement continued in still another foodstuff trade 
conflict 
japanese agriculture ministry official hirohumi ueno ended two 
days of talks with yeutters office wednesday without formally 
announced results on implementation of gatt findings earlier this 
year that japanese import quotas on 10 varieties of canned or 
processed foods were illegal 
the japanese embassy said ueno would return to japan and the 
talks would continue at a date not yet fixed 
during the exchange the us side demanded total removal of the 
quotas within two years while japan proposed a slower 
liberalization program the embassy indicated without giving 
specific details the us side also urged japan against measures 
that could nullify removal of the quotas such as import 
surcharges the embassy said 
there was no immediate comment from the us side led by susan 
early assistant trade representative for agriculture 
affected us exports include preserved concentrated or 
sweetened milk and cream processed cheese preserved beef and 
pork fruit purees pastes pulps and juices tomato ketchup and 
sauce starch sugar dried leguminous vegetables and ground nuts

will be arrived at to resolve the situation in nicaragua 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros told the sandinista governments 
voice of nicaragua radio station 
a few hours later col enrique bermudez the rebel military 
leader arrived on a private plane from the honduran capital of 
tegucigalpa he was accompanied by alfredo cesar head of the rebel 
delegation and other contra officials 
the two dozen rebel delegates went immediately to the camino 
real hotel near the international airport on the outskirts of the 
capital 
matamoros said the first known visit of bermudez to managua 
during the war underlines the contras political will to search 
for a nicaraguan solution to the war 
contra leaders initially refused to return to the capital 
complaining that their movements were restricted in two previous 
sessions this year 
roberto ferrey secretary of the nicaraguan resistance said 
representatives of the contra umbrella organization were going to 
managua with the understanding that there will be complete and 
unrestricted freedom of expression and the free right to meet with 
organizations and leaders 
he spoke by telephone with the associated press from san jose 
the government said tuesday it would allow the rebels to meet 
with the most important opposition group in the country the 
nicaraguan democratic coordinate and to visit the roman catholic 
bishops conference the opposition daily la prensa and relatives 
president daniel ortega rejected contra demands the talks take 
place in the border post of sapoa where the two sides agreed to 
the 60day truce scheduled to expire may 30 
in washington wilson morris an aide to house speaker jim 
wright dtexas said the rebels planned to offer to lay down their 
arms on sept 1 
ortega said on monday he was unilaterally extending the 
temporary truce for an additional 30 days 
rebel leaders have rejected extensions of the truce but members 
of the political directorate said in washington they would not 
break the truce even after may 30 
a major obstacle to agreement has been the issue of delivery of 
nonlethal aid to the rebels gathered in ceasefire zones inside 
nicaragua 
under the sapoa agreement the aid was to come through a neutral 
international organization contras insisted in the talks that they 
had the right to choose the organization 
contra leaders were quoted as saying they would accept a 
proposal for delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside 
nicaragua by an agency with ties to the organization of american 
states 
cesar said in washington that the rebels would propose a 
timetable for political changes that include a free and fair 
electoral system an independent judiciary with the power to 
guarantee human rights removal of the military from sandinista 
party control and guaranteed property rights 
the progovernment newspaper nuevo diario said wednesday the 
government sent the national assembly a bill providing for direct 
elections of city councils in nicaraguan municipalities includng 
managua late this year or early next year 
mayors who now are named by the executive branch would be 
chosen from the city councils it said 
maria elena martinez an assembly spokeswoman said the bill was 
not yet available to the news media 
the constitution provides for election of municipal governments 
through direct free and secret balloting 
ortega says the war has killed 26500 people and caused 3 
billion in damage to the economy

medical tests showed former philippines 
president ferdinand marcos did not suffer a heart attack and the 
philippine consul wednesday accused the hospitalized marcos of 
faking chest pains to gain sympathy in his homeland 
i think these are charades these chest pains are not 
substantiated medically tomas gomez the consul here said we 
are faced with a master manipulator 
marcos physician dr derek pang ruled out a heart attack as 
the cause of the discomfort and ordered marcos to undergo tests 
thursday for a possible lung ailment said marcos spokesman gemmo 
trinidad 
hes in high spirits but will have to have additional tests 
to determine the cause of the pain trinidad said 
marcos 70 was listed in guarded condition wednesday in the 
intensive care unit after being admitted tuesday night st francis 
medical center spokeswoman cheryl yoshina said 
marcos began suffering chest pains tuesday before an hourlong 
interview with allen neuharth chairman of the gannett newspaper 
group according to arturo aruiza marcos chief spokesman after 
consulting his personal physician dr derek pang marcos was 
admitted to the hospital aruiza said 
marcos admitted during the interview that his health was poor a 
rare statement for the former president who has often denied 
earlier reports of ill health 
gomez said marcos hospitalization was a ploy to gain support in 
the philippines for his bid to return home 
he went to the hospital voluntarily under his own steam 
gomez said we know what hes up to 
the hospital would release no specific information about marcos 
condition except that he would be hospitalized at least until 
thursday 
gomez would not speculate on whether marcos would be allowed to 
return to the philippines but in manila several politicians said 
he should be allowed to come home 
this is going to create another problem if marcos comes home 
in a box said sen ernesto maceda now is the time for the 
government to act and allow him to return 
philippine president corazon aquino has refused to allow marcos 
to return for the funeral of his mother who died may 4 and awaits 
burial aquino said marcos poses a threat to national security 
the hospitals intensive care unit section was guarded closely 
by marcos security guards who also manned every entrance to the 
hospital 
marcos wife imelda spent most of the night with her husband 
according to spokesman gemmo trinidad but she made no statement to 
the news media 
marcos and his wife have lived here since fleeing the 
philippines during the february 1986 civilianmilitary revolution 
toppled him after 20 years in power

a flight mechanic stole a private learjet from 
virginia on wednesday and took it on a 1600mile joyride to 
denver where he killed himself as authorities approached the 
plane officials said 
mike christiansen 24 who was not a licensed pilot was found 
dead at the controls of the twinengine plane a learjet 36a 
moments after a pilot he knew talked him through a relatively 
routine landing at stapleton international airport at 518 am 
authorities said 
the pilot bob cunningham said he was not nervous in talking 
christiansen down because i was confident he was going to listen 
to me 
police fbi agents and emergency personnel were waiting at the 
edge of the runway with their lights off when christiansen landed 
the plane five hours after stealing the 10seat plane from patrick 
henry international airport in newport news va 
christiansen of newport news worked as a flight mechanic at 
the airport for atlantabased flight international which owned the 
plane and operates the worlds largest fleet of learjets officials 
said 
as the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached he 
was ordered to lock his brakes said stapleton spokesman richard 
boulware they heard a noise and when they looked in the cockpit 
they found him dead things happened really fast 
denver fbi spokesman dick schussler said the agency knew little 
about christiansen gordon james executive vice president of 
flight international would only confirm he had been employed 
there the associated press made 30 calls to the apartment complex 
where he lived and found only one resident at home she said she 
never had heard of him 
authorities said they do not know why christiansen who was 
alone in the plane killed himself or where he got the gun the fbi 
and federal aviation administration were investigating 
no motive for the plane theft was given although boulware said 
the indication was that he just wanted to fly around for awhile 
this guy obviously was a proficient pilot said boulware 
he made a good landing right in the middle of the runway with no 
damage to the plane or the runway the very fact that he got off 
the ground shows that he knew something 
pete daikos spokesman for patrick henry airport said 
christiansen did not have a pilots license and had been employed 
with flight international since march 
as the plane was taking off around 215 am edt it clipped a 
security guards van on a runway shearing off part of a wingtip 
fuel tank and damaging the drivers side of the van said daikos 
the guard escaped injury because he had gotten out of the van 
moments earlier daikos said 
the plane apparently was airborne for the next five hours 
although faa officials in denver said they did not know 
christiansens whereabouts until he was detected over western 
kansas 
controllers at several airports had tracked the plane during 
parts of its flight said dick stafford an faa spokesman in 
washington dc 
frank johns senior faa official at the stapleton tower said 
the faa contacted international jet aviation services in englewood 
and asked whether a learjet pilot was available to help 
christiansen land the plane 
in the meantime the faa rerouted some flights along 
christiansens projected flight path and stapleton officials 
cleared runways 
cunningham an international jet aviation pilot talked 
christiansen through the landing the faa played a 19minute tape 
recording of their conversation which dealt exclusively with 
altitude airspeed and other technical adjustments christiansen was 
asked to make before setting the plane down 
in a news conference wednesday evening he said he quickly 
recognized the voice on the radio as christiansen a former 
employee of his own company whom he recalled as a very personable 
man 
he did his job well i never had any problems with him he 
said adding that he did not find out that christiansen had 
committed suicide until 10 minutes after the landing 
i was shocked to get that news and i though it was very 
tragic he said 
after christiansen landed cunningham asked are you ok mike 
mike are you ok have you got that thing shut down yet there 
was no reply and boulware said christiansen was found dead moments 
later 
vern alexander a spokesman for learjet in tucson ariz said 
the learjet 36a has a range of 2568 miles and a cruising speed of 
over 500 mph a standardequipped model which sells for 425 
million seats 10 passengers and a crew of two

after six years and a dozen emmy awards nbcs 
unconventional hospital show st elsewhere left the air 
wednesday night after a final scene that may have perplexed many 
viewers 
in a maniacal twist on the itwasalladream plot that 
dallas made famous the final scene revealed that the entire 
series had never existed except in the mind of the autistic son of 
one of the doctors westphall 
up until the surprise ending the final episode titled the 
last one seemed a basic endofseries sendoff in view of the 
shows irreverent philosophy perhaps it was in fact an obscure 
satire on final episodes 
i expect a very mixed reaction to the ending said bruce 
paltrow one of the shows executive producers i think some 
people will think its extraordinary and existential and 
quintessential st elsewhere i think other people will find it 
puzzling odd maybe unfulfilling in some way i think well get a 
broad range of responses those being the poles 
when it made its debut six season ago the show was part of a 
wave of creativity mainly from mtm productions that 
revolutionized stodgy network programming in the 1980s st 
elsewhere followed the mtm series hill street blues onto nbc 
and was inevitably compared to the earlier shows groundbreaking 
style quick cuts subplots overlapping dialogue and handheld 
cameras 
but st elsewhere went beyond hill street a police 
show in social satire even making fun of its own network and 
previous mtm shows 
the st elsewhere writers had wanted to go all out in the 
final episode but prohibitive costs kept their script a 
futuristic view of st eligius hospital at the edge of apocalypse 
from being filmed 
set in the year 2013 it depicted the st eligius doctors as 
well as some nowpracticing offspring waiting for a huge cloud of 
toxic gas released in a war between us inc and corporate 
africa the script revealed that fox and nbc are the only two tv 
networks of the future and that ed mcmahon will become a major 
cultural figure 
in the end prohibitive costs knocked down not only the intended 
final episode but the show itself st elsewhere was produced 
at a loss by mtm at a time when hourlong series are not selling 
well in syndication 
the show has been sold in syndication though mtm will release 
no details in an apparently personal inside joke in the dialogue 
of the final script dr wayne fiscus howie mandel says of his 
years at st eligius grueling hours bad food egomania death 
and moral confusion itll be hard to leave 
the producers of the show have long since left and are busy on a 
new series for nbc tattingers an offbeat romantic comedy set 
in a popular new york restaurant it is being shot on location here 
and stars stephen collins blythe danner and jerry stiller the 
show is on nbcs fall schedule in the same time period that st 
elsewhere is leaving

leaving 17 rebels dead and three soldiers seriously wounded 
military sources said wednesday 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
fighting occurred early tuesday on the outskirts of marcala about 
90 miles northwest of the honduran capital of tegucigalpa and 40 
miles from the salvadoran border

firefighters opened a vent on a blazing 
overturned propane tanker wednesday to try to speed up the burning 
of a fire that closed two highways and a commuter rail line for a 
second day officials said 
some 500 families remained evacuated wednesday police said 
a vent atop the truck normally used to let air out as the 
tanker is filled was opened on the firefighters third attempt to 
increase the flow of fuel without setting off an explosion 
officials said they couldnt predict how long the fire would 
burn because they didnt know how large the rupture was or how much 
opening the valve helped the blaze started when the tanker 
overturned at 930 am tuesday 
fire chief raymond kuhner said earlier wednesday although the 
accelerated burn method was risky it was no riskier than 
letting the blaze continue the 2500gallon tank could have burned 
up to eight days if the flow had not been increased he said 
the seafordoyster bay expressway and the sunrise highway 
remained closed for a second day forcing thousands of motorists to 
find alternate routes to new york 
the long island rail road said 30000 rail commuters were 
directly affected by the closing of several stations on a branch 
line although extra trains were added to the main line 
the threat of an explosion caused officials to evacuate homes 
within a halfmile radius around the tanker said nassau county 
executive thomas gulotta police said 500 households were affected 
revising tuesdays figure of 2000 families about 300 evacuees 
spent the night at seaford middle school 
firefighters kept firetrucks spewing water on the fire to 
control it even as they tried to open valves to increase the 
propane flow 
the first valve attempted was found to be melted shut they then 
tried to install a belly valve that would allow a controlled 
flow but that also failed finally in late afternoon they opened 
the vent and hoped propane would trickle out 
fire communications supervisor douglas wood said the fire 
marshals office and hazardous materials experts were at the scene 
and ambulances were standing by in case of an explosion 
county police lt willard krausch said the truck owned by 
conservative gas co of hyde park overturned on the expressway 
tuesday morning when the driver experienced a problem with the 
trucks rear wheels 
the driver identified by police as roger vai 35 of westbury 
and a passenger escaped before the truck ignited 
vai who was treated at the scene for a shoulder cut was 
arrested on an outstanding traffic offense and was charged with 
driving with a suspended license and failure to produce a license 
he was released on 100 bail 
propane such as that carried on the truck meets a variety of 
residential and commercial energy needs particularly in areas not 
served by natural gas

cable viewers can catch a couple of hot stars 
from the big screen in a new hbo movie ellen barkin from the big 
easy and andy garcia who went from virtual unknown to star of a 
boxoffice smash the untouchables 
in clinton and nadine garcia plays a downonhisluck 
smuggler of exotic birds who gets mixed up in a plot to run guns 
for the contras the movie premieres saturday 
garcia was born in cuba but his family fled as political 
refugees in 1961 and settled in miami beach 
clinton and nadine was shot on location in florida 
ive been here los angeles for 10 years but i still like 
miami better because of the weather garcia said its closer 
to the caribbean the downfall for me here is the smog i like 
the feeling of tropical weather i like a tropical night with the 
breeze off the ocean the caribbean is in my blood 
i was only 5 when i left cuba so im obsessed with it ive 
built my own memory of it thats greater than what it was 
clinton and nadine also stars 1988 oscar nominee morgan 
freeman street smart as a slick miami lawyer who is part of 
the scheme to raise money for the contras 
garcia plays clinton dillard a smalltime smuggler who is 
quitting the business when he discovers that his lawyerbrother has 
been murdered a key to the murder is a cassette tape which he 
finds in a womans purse the purse belongs to nadine powers a 
highclass hooker with a baby and a dream of living an idyllic life 
in canada 
the two are quickly swept up and find themselves in costa rica 
in a lot of trouble 
the key for me was that jerry schatzberg was directing said 
garcia hed directed scarecrow and panic in needle park i 
met him in new york and when he told me he was talking to ellen 
barkin and morgan freeman that was the icing on the cake 
the costa rican scenes were shot on a 30acre estate in fort 
lauderdale it was filled with monkeys and they became quite a 
sound problem garcia said every morning the owners would come 
out on the balcony and feed them some became quite aggressive and 
one day they attacked the person i was sitting with 
garcia also recently costarred in stand and deliver a true 
story about a crusading teacher played by edward james olmos he 
said another reason he liked the role of clinton was the chance to 
play a nonminority character clinton is from oklahoma 
ive played a lot of ethnic characers using spanish or 
italian he said clintons life was in limbo hed been an 
athlete i could tell he was in the line of business he was in and 
spending his time in mexico to alienate himself from the baseball 
world it was painful he wanted to be a loner in nadine he found 
a woman going through the same alienation 
i was a jock myself except for me it was basketball but that 
didnt pan out and i was in limbo my interest in the arts sort of 
took over after my first college play it sort of took over i 
think theres a geat parallel between sports and acting especially 
basketball which is very spontaneous you have the thrill of the

through their churches american kids are 
sending a colorful stream of good wishes to their counterparts in 
the soviet union as it marks the 1000th anniversary of 
christianity there 
i love you many of the youngsters scrawl on their 
handfashioned cards decorated with brightly hued figures lets 
be friends write to me 
called a childtochild crayon brigade about 40000 cards 
have been received by the national council of churches for relay to 
children of soviet church members 
the cards are being carried personally in batches by church 
groups visiting soviet churches this year groups went in april and 
may and others go in july august september and october 
additionally many protestant roman catholic and eastern 
orthodox leaders from this country and elsewhere are to be there 
for special celebrations june 516 
but it was the outpouring of fond joyful artwork by children in 
more than 3000 sunday school classes in about 60 denominations 
that provided the sentimental touch 
it was an overflowing of childrens naturalness says 
suzanne nagel a new york episcopalian who originated the project 
asking churches across the country to send cards made by youngsters 
she says some include photos of themselves and families and 
adds these are really meaningful theyre personalized so the 
receiving soviet child can say see my american friend has brown 
hair 
many of the cards which have come from children in all 50 
states are decorated with crosses hearts flags birthday cakes 
balloons trees flowers and smiling faces 
besides wishing happy birthday many cards include 
expressions of affection and cheering hopes 
there also are typical childish misspellings such as habbi 
l000 and prays the lord 
we want to be friends with our brothers and sisters in christ 
in the ussr and we send these handmade birthday cards as tokens 
of friendship wrote the treacher of a denver sunday school class 
when some of the cards were being distributed to soviet children 
at a church in kiev mothers had tears in their eyes says the 
rev john lindner who led a us tour group there in april 
the cards range from simple to elaborate many with words and 
pictures in crayon colors others done with magic markers or 
watercolors some children sent posters decorated by the whole 
class others cloth banners 
ms nagel says the project breaks down hate and lessens 
fear between soviet and american children and helps us to see 
our mutual christianity 
so much of the hate on both sides is manufactured and our 
children are afraid each child that sits and scribbles away will 
feel less threatened 
the overwhelming response to the project was generated in part 
by an article about it in the march 1988 issue of guideposts an 
interdenominational magazine published by the rev norman vincent 
peale 
kathy todd coordinator of the ecumenical travel seminars to the 
soviet says the response has been a touching and dramatic 
demonstration of an openness to and interest in soviet christians 
the cards are for the most part coming from ordinary 
christians all over america in fact from the people most often 
thought of as patriotic and antisoviet 
this flow of good will toward their brothers and sisters in 
the soviet union shows the strong desire on the part of many 
americans to get involved and to know each other better

mikhail s gorbachev the reformminded son of a 
southern russian peasant is redefining what the world expects from 
the soviet union and from the man who leads it 
this 57yearold law school graduate and career communist has 
turned a halfcentury of soviet economic orthodoxy on its head by 
praising individual enterprise and profitability and relaxing 
bureaucratic controls on managers and workers alike 
unlike his predecessors this kremlin leader preaches his 
reformist brand of socialism with a mix of fiery conviction and 
madison avenue flare whether he is facing foreign journalists 
questioning him about human rights bantering with peasants on a 
collective farm or inviting american schoolchildren to the kremlin 
gorbachev seems at home with himself and his role as general 
secretary of the communist party 
he says he seeks a new working relationship with the united 
states and the west that will decrease global tensions and allow 
the soviet union to turn more resources from the military sector to 
developing the countrys stagnant civilian economy 
when he greets president reagan on sunday for their fourth 
summit meeting gorbachev will be hoping to further his own 
domestic agenda as well as foreign policy goals such as a 50 
percent cut in strategic nuclear arms 
soviet foreign policy he has said is more than ever 
determined by domestic policy by our interest in concentrating on 
constructive endeavors to improve our country this is why we need 
lasting peace predictability and constructiveness in international 
relations 
since march 1985 when he became soviet leader gorbachevs 
achievements in the foreign policy field have been far more 
tangible than progress in the titanic task he has set for himself 
in reviving his countrys economy and modernizing its social 
structure 
at the washington summit last december gorbachev and reagan 
signed a treaty banning mediumrange nuclear missiles the first 
superpower pact in history that mandates the scrapping of an entire 
category of weapons 
on may 15 the first units of a soviet force estimated at 
115000 troops returned home from afghanistan the soviet military 
intervention in support of a socialist regime in that neighboring 
country had been an irritant in ussoviet relations for more than 
eight years 
at home gorbachev is pursuing reforms that dismantle much of 
the topheavy bureaucracy that has micromanaged the soviet economy 
since the reign of dictator josef v stalin this renunciation of 
longstanding socialist orthodoxy plus the kremlins glasnost 
campaign for more openness and criticism has left many soviets 
bewildered 
some people have indeed lost their bearings amid all these 
processes under way gorbachev acknowledged earlier this month 
some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked 
gorbachev can be charming or tough philosophical or 
downtoearth solemn or jovial but his message to his countrymen 
is usually the same the country must modernize quickly and work 
harder or it will squander the gains of 70 years of socialism 
the reorganization which we have launched this is where we 
want to direct our resources this is where our thoughts are going 
these are our actual programs and intentions on this we intend to 
spend the intellectual energy of our society he has said 
in november gorbachev proved his toughness by firing moscow 
party chief boris n yeltsin a former protege who criticized the 
slow pace of the reforms at a closed meeting of the party 
leadership but rather than thrust yeltsin into the utter obscurity 
usually reserved for fallen officials gorbachev has appointed him 
to a high post in the housing bureacracy 
when widespread demonstrations broke out in the armenian capital 
of yerevan in february calling for the annexation of a part of 
neighboring azerbaijan gorbachev temporarily defused ethnic 
tensions by issuing an unprecedented personal appeal for calm 
in late june gorbachev is expected to use a special nationwide 
party conference the first since 1941 to set his stamp even more 
firmly on the party by ousting communists who oppose or are 
indifferent to his drive for perestroika or economic and 
social restructuring 
like most of his predecessors gorbachev rose to the kremlin 
from humble origins 
born march 2 1931 to a peasant family in the farming region of 
stavropol between the black and caspian seas gorbachev started 
work as a laborer on a tractor station when he was 15 
little is known about his early years or his life during the 
nazi occupation of southern russia during world war ii gorbachevs 
mother still reportedly lives in the village of privolnoye where he 
was born 
in 1950 gorbachev was among the members of the komsomol young 
communist league chosen because of academic ability and 
workingclass origins to study at the prestigious moscow state 
university 
it was there he met raisa titorenko an auburnhaired student 
from siberia whom he married in 1954 and whose glamor and wit 
would later help him give the soviet union a new image abroad 
in 1955 gorbachev graduated with a law degree and he returned 
to his native stavropol region to begin a succession of komsomol 
and communist party jobs in 1970 at age 39 he was named party 
first secretary in the graingrowing region becoming moscows 
viceroy in an area the size of south carolina 
in 1979 under thenpresident leonid i brezhnev gorbachev was 
brought to moscow to take charge of the nations problemplagued 
farm sector his inability to produce any visible improvement in 
food supplies had no apparent effect on his party standing 
once in the soviet capital gorbachev quickly widened his 
influence becoming a candidate member on the ruling politburo in 
1979 and a full voting member the next year 
after the death in 1984 of brezhnevs successor yuri v 
andropov who was believed to be grooming gorbachev for toplevel 
responsibilities gorbachev reportedly acquiesced in the choice of 
konstantin u chernenko for the soviet leadership 
but by the time the ailing chernenko died in march 1985 
gorbachev had been dubbed the partys second secretary by a 
soviet editor and was running meetings of the ruling politburo 
within hours of chernenkos passing gorbachev was named party 
general secretary becoming at age 54 the youngest kremlin leader 
since stalin 
in his first months in power gorbachev moved quickly to chart a 
program of economic modernization decreed an antidrinking 
campaign proclaimed the kremlins desire to scrap all nuclear 
weapons by the year 2000 and had to deal with historys worst 
nuclear power accident when an explosion and fire ruptured a 
reactor at the chernobyl power plant in the ukraine in april 1986

deep in a mangrove swamp near the gulf of 
mexico archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be 
another ancient mexican civilization 
so far the only clues to these mysterious people are a fourton 
stele or stone slab covered with hieroglyphic writing and a 
19inchhigh clay figure of a fertilityrite priest 
but says fernando winfield capitaine director of the 
xalapa museum of anthropology the finds are so promising that 
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of 
veracruz state in cooperation with the national geographic 
society 
the stele was found in november 1986 it is covered with 
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some mayan numerals 
the priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a 
flayed sacrificial victim 
both are about 1800 years old 
that would place them in the second century ad which is 
after the archaeological olmecs who flourished in the area from 
around 1050 to 500 bc and before the mayas who emerged around 
the fourth century ad winfield said in an interview 
adding to the intrigue the mayas lived in the yucatan 
peninsula more than 700 miles to the east winfield said at the 
museum in xalapa where the stele and figure are kept 
but there are two dates on the stele in mayan writing in 
their socalled long count calendar made up of dots and bars 
equivalent to may 22 143 ad and july 13 156 ad winfield 
said 
if the mysterious people did exist winfield said they also 
appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known 
civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast the totonacas who 
emerged around the seventh century ad in the area where the 
artifacts were found or the huaxtecas farther north about one 
century later 
they could be the xicalancas of which clavijero briefly 
talked about winfield said referring to the rev francisco 
javier francisco javier clavijero 17311787 a jesuit priest who 
was the first to systematically study mexicos ancient languages 
and peoples 
in his history of ancient mexico clavijero in three lines 
briefly mentioned the xicalanca civilization in relation to the 
olmecs but did not go into details 
in nahuatl the trading language of the aztecs who came 
much later xicalanca means the people who live by the great body 
of salt water as the gulf of mexico was called 
the two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in 
the village of la mojarra where the piojo river meets the acula 
river the crocodileinfested region is so swampy that it can be 
reached only by boat winfield said 
la mojarra with a population of fewer than 200 is up the acula 
about 20 miles south of the port of alvarado in veracruz state but 
neither the village nor the piojo river can be found on any map of 
mexico 
carved in relief on the previously polished stele which is of 
basalt one of the worlds hardest rocks is the full length 
profile of a regal figure a man about 25 years old holding out in 
both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering 
he was probably a ruler or a chief warrior or a high priest 
or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region 
in ancient times winfield said 
the figure wears earstops a tall headdress adorned with four 
representations of something like a rain god trimmed with eight 
feathers and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over 
what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic 
a total of 577 glyphs or picturewords divided into 21 neat 
rows running from top to bottom plus 33 elements like the 
raingod representations cover the rest of the slab 
it was all carved during one continuous period winfield 
said it was a single piece of work it is the oldest and richest 
piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient mexico 
about 7 feet tall slightly oblong and with a gently rounded 
top the stele once stood on the right bank of the acula just 
outside la mojarra 
over the years erosion toppled it and it lay in the river 
until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of 
villagers 
archaeologists retrieved the stele but winfield said he kept 
the find quiet for two years so work could proceed without the 
pressure that such a discovery creates 
the second piece the ceramic figure of a priest made with the 
regions thick orange clay has a square base it is the only one 
of two artifacts from that area with a base the other also in the 
museum is so badly damaged it cannot be studied winfield said 
in the la mojarra figure only the head is missing 
that type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf 
cultures the aztecs called it in xipe totec or the lord of the 
flayed and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring of 
fertility of abundance and of the metalworkers 
a peasant at la mojarra found the shattered figure many years 
ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces 
in a cardboard box 
we got wind of it three weeks ago and we convinced him to let 
the museum have it winfield said 
winfield suspects the la mojarra area could have been a 
ceremonial site 
if so there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be 
found he said

political disorders ethnic tensions 
poverty and international disputes are churning up the south seas 
in an arc curving sharply northward from new zealand and back down 
to australia 
vanuatu new caledonia fiji tahiti papua new guinea tonga 
western samoa even new zealand and australia themselves have had 
a taste of trouble in the past year 
most recently it was rioting in vanuatu over land claims and in 
the french territory of new caledonia 19 native kanaks were killed 
in a shootout with french troops in ethnic and political disorders 
fiji has seen two coups in the past year and the former british 
island remains unstable in the aftermath 
australia is concerned about what it sees as the speading 
influence of libyas col moammar gadhafi in the area and the 
inroads made by the soviet union in what long has been seen as an 
american lake 
a commentator in the sydney morning herald newspaper said the 
image of a south seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished 
the past year also has seen riots in tahiti and political 
upheaval in papua new guinea over the alleged corruption of cabinet 
ministers 
new zealand faces racial unrest as indigenous maoris press the 
labor party government of prime minister david lange with a battery 
of land and fisheries claims 
in australia aborigines are using this years bicentennial 
celebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of european 
settlement 200 years ago 
in early may bloody violence erupted over territorial and 
french presidential elections in new caledonia culminating in the 
rescue of french hostages held in caves by melanesian separatists 
21 people were killed 
on may 16 a drunken mob ran riot through vanuatus capital 
port vila looting shops and smashing office windows one man died 
nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in the 
rioting over land claims 
australia and new zealand responded to the crisis by airlifting 
riotcontrol gear to vanuatu at prime minister walter linis 
request 
prime minister bob hawke of australia linked libya to the 
rioting and said australia could not stand by as a friendly 
countrys government is undermined by what he called a 
nondemocratic process 
there is no doubt about a libyan connection in vanuatu 
hawke said in a city with a population of less than 20000 it is 
clear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale 
vanuatu formerly the britishfrench new hebrides shocked the 
generally prowestern south pacific with its decision in 1986 to 
establish diplomatic relations with libya and the soviet union 
since then the soviet union has sought fishing agreements with 
papua new guinea and impoverished kiribati creating concern in 
australia as well as washington about soviet inroads in the region 
more recently the soviet union has approached australia for 
fishing access to australian ports for refueling purposes and to 
australian airports for fishing crews in transit hawke said he 
would treat the request with caution 
elsewhere in the south pacific such nations as tonga and 
western samoa face poverty overcrowding and unemployment many of 
the islanders have migrated to australia and new zealand in search 
of jobs 
all these are turning the once tranquil south pacific into an 
increasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots the 
sydney morning herald said 
the sydney daily telegraph echoed that concern calling the 
situation a powderkeg 
the multiple problems of these islands has led to a rising 
discontent the telegraph said moscow has been making big 
efforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group through 
fishery deals and aid 
racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem of 
many pacific islands where populations are mainly melanesian fiji 
and new caledonia are examples 
australia is the major power in the region and its largest aid 
donor 
foreign minister bill hayden has expressed concern about libyan 
activities going as far as to close down libyas diplomatic 
mission in canberra last year after an incident involving the 
aboriginal activist michael mansell 
mansell had returned from libya saying gadhafi was prepared to 
bankroll a black revolution in australia 
the scattered violence in the south seas has no single 
connective thread although in new caledonia and french polynesia 
the crises erupted after france refused to follow the regional 
pattern of decolonization and independence 
france already suffers a major image problem in the south seas 
with the bombing of the greenpeace vessel rainbow warrior in new 
zealand in 1985 and its continued underground nuclear testing on 
the mururoa atoll over the objections of almost every island state 
in the region 
the island states supported by australia and new zealand have 
declared the south pacific a nuclearfree zone 
in a major turnaround the united states in 1986 designated the 
south pacific an area of concern because of a buildup of the soviet 
pacific fleet 
us officials believe the soviet fleet consists of 755 ships 
and patrol craft including 141 submarines

it began with rural women passing on 
the traditional crafts of knitting and weaving grandmother to 
mother to daughter 
today it is a 4millionayear business cooperative shipping 
colorful sweaters around the world including the united states 
manos del uruguay hands of uruguay is made up of 18 rural 
cooperatives whose workers spin knit weave and dye virgin wool 
one of uruguays top commodities entirely by hand 
it was founded in 1968 by sara beisso and four other members of 
uruguays high society who had second homes on ranch estates 
outside montevideo 
unemployment was high in south americas smallest republic at 
the time so the five devised a way for rural women to do what they 
knew best weave colorful sweaters using natural vegetable dyes 
and uruguays virgin wool 
the result is a richly colored wool woven in bright distinctive 
sweaters as well as in rugs tapestries and placemats each 
article bears the name of the artisan and where it was made on a 
card accompanying the product 
finding many of the artisans work sites on a map is often 
difficult they include tacuarembo said to be the birthplace of 
famed tango singer carlos gardel and villages such as los mellizos 
and quebracho 
one thousand workers in more than 40 sites some using just a 
loom or a table under a tree labor over the sweaters tapestries 
and rugs each sweater takes 12 to 28 hours to finish mrs beisso 
said 
most of the sweaters end up in shops in neighboring argentina 
but many are shipped to the united states italy japan and 
belgium seventy percent of manos sweaters are exported said 
maria orfila algalarronda 
ms algalarronda 36 was with manos from its start weaving 
from the village of paso de la cruz two decades later she is 
secretary counsel of the sevenmember directorate five women two 
men that oversees manos operations from montevideo 
now one of uruguays largest exporters of wool manos is 
wellregarded in business circles for the quality of its work and 
fashion acumen 
manos is an experience thats practically unique in the 
world ms algalarronda said in an interview the world is a 
very competitive place and uruguay is a very small place but at a 
minimum manos has turned into a source of work for 1000 women 
each sweater which costs the equivalent of about 30 in 
uruguay sells for up to 300 in the united states or japan said 
maria cecilia fernandez an aide in the promotion department of 
manos main office in the oldtown section of this capital city 
in the united states manos sweaters can be found in some saks 
fifth avenue and ann taylor stores mrs beisso said manos 
recently opened a small showroom in new york city 
ms algalarronda said 50 designs are ready for the 1989 summer 
collection including sweaters specially made for japan smaller 
sizes because the japanese are smaller the united states 
simpler designs and spain reds and blacks are popular 
a specially designed sofa that pope john paul ii used at a mass 
in salto uruguay on his visit in may was produced by manos mrs 
beisso said 
manos is set up so that regional leaders from each cooperative 
elect representatives who then report to the directorate in 
montevideo all business decisions from designs to marketing and 
exports are made only after receiving input from the interior ms 
algalarronda said 
any profits 1987 sales were 4 million are plowed back into 
the business helping keep those workers employed which was the 
founding purpose of manos 
its a fine source of employment but not a good business 
mrs beisso said the people in the country are the ones who 
really profit from this

david shepherdsons job is to take the boredom out 
of life for the animals at the london zoo putting something more 
into their day than sleeping eating and watching humans 
he has piped gibbon music into the the gibbon cage 
for the mongooses he has provided pieces of hollow wood filled 
with crickets for the animals to try to catch cricket 
dispensers he calls them 
he plans a lightandsound show for the orangutans 
the lanky 28yearold englishman whose doctoral thesis had him 
tracking wild badgers by radio at night became behavioral 
enrichment officer six months ago at the london zoo the first 
british zoo to have one 
believing a little work for the animals is healthy too 
shepherdson is making some species work for their dinners 
zoos should show the animal as it behaves in the wild he 
said for example in the wild most species spend more than 50 
percent of their time foraging for food in the zoo they get 
fed once a day 
you have a choice either change the environment or you 
dont keep the animals properly 
trevor paul director of research at the universities federation 
for animal welfare the independent body cosponsoring 
shepherdsons post says the project also works well for people who 
visit the zoo 
there isnt a great deal of point in them seeing an animal 
sitting in a corner behind bars he said 
he and shepherdson say that while zoos in many countries are 
making cages more natural few have spent much time studying animal 
behavior in relation to their habitats 
the 161yearold london zoos gibbon monkeys never did much 
loafing in their treelined outdoor enclosure but with the change 
in their zoo habitat theyve become much more feisty 
gibbons usually have one mate for life and assert their 
territory by singing london zoos pair werent as musical as they 
should have been until shepherdson hung stereo speakers near their 
cage and played taped gibbon duets twice a day 
thinking they have neighbors the gibbons now sing too 
shepherdson is also working on a computer keyboard to produce 
sounds food or even slide shows when orangutans operate it 
paul said an electronic organ failed to excite the apes so 
well try to get a keyboard which does more things than produce 
sound 
simple toys often involving food are best for most animals 
shepherdson said 
he had praise for hal markowitz a us behavioral enrichment 
pioneer who installed a machine to toss meatballs into a servals 
cage but added that he believes more naturalistic tools should be 
explored 
recently shepherdson equipped the ringtailed lemurs cage with 
poles that sway like the trees in the primates native madagascar 
paul said one of the best ways to simulate natural behavior is 
to make an animal work for its food and spend normal amounts of 
time foraging 
in the kinkajous cage carrots bananas and apples hang from 
the ceiling some tantalizingly out of reach for the weasellike 
creatures 
before getting the snacks the female paced for hours one of 
the first signs of boredom said shepherdson watching as she 
pursued a banana just beyond nosereach 
even tortoises pace im told shepherdson added its not 
a lack of space its what you have in that space thats 
important 
after a cage is outfitted zoo workers watch the animals for 
hours to see how they respond 
in every case so far theres been a beneficial effect said 
shepherdson if every zoo in the country did these things it 
would be a great step forward in animal welfare

it was all set a rare convergence in the soviet 
union of eastern orthodox leadership plus other top christian 
echelons but then by some labyrinthine tangle unravelings 
appeared in the orthodox tapestry 
little was clear about why and official statements about it 
were couched in the vague circumlocutions of byzantine innuendo it 
stunned and bewildered many churchmen 
its very strange and astonishing says the rev john 
meyendorff dean of st vladimirs seminary at crestwood ny and 
a leading theologian of the orthodox church in america 
however you interpret the official statements there must be 
other reasons there is something more subtle and typically 
mideastern about it they never never say anything directly but 
always sideways 
what jolted eastern orthdoxy was the abrupt word last week that 
its top spiritual leader patriarch demetrios of constantinople 
modern istanbul wont attend soviet celebrations of 
christianitys 1000th anniversary there 
most all of the eastern churchs nine patriarchs apparently had 
been going to be there june 516 including or so it seemed 
demetrios making it an unprecedented modern gathering of leaders 
of the worlds 200 million orthodox 
demetrios had visited the soviet union last august had friendly 
meetings with the russian orthodox patriarch pimen and other 
clergy and said he planned to take part in the june celebrations 
there 
then came the cryptic announcement last week from orthodoxys 
ecumenical patriarchate in constantinople that demetrios would not 
attend because appropriate conditions for participation do not 
exist 
an orthodox official in athens greece maintained then that 
demetrios had determined he would not join in liturgies with 
leaders of the russian orthodox church in america whose 
independence he did not recognize 
however that was an old issue going back 18 years to 1970 
when russian orthodoxy granted selfgoverning status to its us 
offspring the millionmember orthodox church in america 
while that status was not officially recognized by the 
ecumenical patriarchate no open conflict or breach in communion 
occurred over it and the matter seemed largely disregarded 
working relationships have gone on between the russianderived 
oca and the 2millionmember greek orthodox church which remains 
under governing oversight of the ecumenical patriarchate 
there must be some other factor in greek politics memory or 
worry behind demetrios somewhat lasthour decision to avoid the 
gathering says ocas meyendorff who had a friendly visit with him 
in 1986 
i suspect theres something more to it than the american 
situation meyendorff added in a telephone interview it may be 
just a pretext thats very characteristic perhaps the turkish 
government is behind it it may be an administrative not 
ecclesiastical conflict 
i personally dont understand it something is behind it with 
which i cannot fully connect 
there also was puzzlement in greek orthodox offices in new york 
where the head of american greek orthodoxy archbishop iakovos 
promptly called off plans to attend the soviet celebrations since 
demetrios isnt going 
iakovos exarch representative of demetrios in the america 
meanwhile was briefed by a demetrios aide metropolitan 
chrysostomos on the reasons for the sudden reversal of plans 
afterward iakovos said that chrysostomos said it became 
evident that through the millenium celebrations an attempt was 
being made to gain panorthodox acceptance of certain 
anticannonical conditions 
the circuitously worded may 24 statement added 
the cancellation of the trip became obligatory because the 
anticannonical conditions assume seemingly de facto recognitions 
concerning matters already included in the agenda of the 
forthcoming preparatory meeting of the panorthodox synod on which 
most of the worlds orthodox churches have already taken a position 
against 
asked what that meant nikki stephanopoulos information 
director for greek orthodoxy said she just couldnt be sure 
they didnt want to say what the conditions were its a matter 
of trying to be diplomatic 
they dont want to offend anybody the powers that be must 
know but they evidently dont want to say maybe there are other 
things but as i see it its strictly ecclesiastical 
it came so much out of the blue its a big shock theres a 
lot of stories and rumors floating around 
the rev michael roshak an oca clergyman noted that the oca is 
a canonically recognized member of the council of orthodox bishops 
which iakovos led in organizing 20 years ago 
roshak who heads the europesoviet office of the national 
council of churches said that for demetrios to cancel 
participation in the russian orthodox celebration was certainly 
not a sign of conciliarity and unity 
it was not an exemplary thing to do the church in the soviet 
has enough problems it has withstood difficulties and is at an 
uneasy moment that also has hopeful possibilities this shift is 
very peculiar 
it is too much a revival of byzantine intrigue

eight soviet kids go to school at the phillips 
academy in andover mass vladimir horowitz performs in moscow 
scientists from the superpower nations agree to work together to 
combat the greenhouse effect which is overheating the world 
those are some of the consequences from the first meeting 
between president reagan and soviet communist party general 
secretary mikhail gorbachev in neutral switzerland 2 years ago 
agreements reached in geneva dealing with the environment air 
travel cultural scientific and educational exchanges nuclear 
tests and reduction of the risk of nuclear war led to the following 
events 
a historic treaty eliminating mediumrange nuclear weapons was 
signed by reagan and gorbachev at their third meeting in washington 
last december the groundwork had been done in geneva 
eight soviet high school students spent more than a month at 
the phillips academy and eight american teenagers studied at 
novosibirsk school of physics and mathematics in siberia 
horowitz the famous pianist performed in moscow in april 
1986 the first time he played in his homeland in 60 years 
pan american world airways and aeroflot formed a joint venture 
for direct flights between moscow and new york 
members of congress exchanged views on security and human 
rights with soviet officials in a live television show beamed 
directly to audiences in both countries 
twenty americans toured the soviets test site at semipalatinsk 
in central asia as part of an agreement to monitor nuclear tests 
soviet scientists did the same at a site in nevada 
the national resources defense council signed an agreement with 
the soviet academy of sciences to begin work on a conservation 
project designed to abate climate changes resulting from the 
warming of the globe the greenhouse effect 
eleven soviet researchers attended a symposium at the 
university of iowa last october on how to transport pesticides and 
the presence of chemicals in the environment 
the two sides agreed to open consulates in kiev and in new 
york these have yet to be established although preliminary work 
has started 
peripheral agreements are sure to grow out of the fourth 
gorbachevreagan summit opening sunday in moscow not all summits 
lead to agreements summit no 2 the october 1986 meeting in 
reykjavik iceland was a public failure ending in harsh words and 
recriminations on both sides 
much of this is dependent on changes in the soviet society 
said greg guroff speaking of the burgeoning number of 
peopletopeople exchanges guroff is acting coordinator of the 
ussoviet exchange initiative at the us information agency 
the treaty signed in washington that calls for the elimination 
of the nuclear missiles with a range of between 300 and 3400 miles 
is the most significant agreement reached by the superpowers at the 
summit 
but it has overshadowed some of the lesspublicized results of 
the summit meetings which are often the climax of months and years 
of behindthescenes diplomatic negotiations 
one summit issue left over from 1985 steps to halt the spread 
of nuclear weapons to nations that dont have them may resurface 
in moscow us officials said the two sides also may sign an 
agreement limiting experiments at the soviet and american test 
sites the americans say 
the reagan administration has refused to push for ratification 
of a 1974 treaty on peaceful nuclear explosions for engineering 
purposes and a 1976 treaty that limits the size of such explosions 
until verification for both is improved 
but for the average citizen of either country such agreements 
are abstract and remote agreements in the scientific educational 
and cultural fields are more likely to have results people can see 
understand and applaud 
us officials are thrilled with the enthusiasm americans and 
soviets have shown for getting to know each other but they say the 
soviets have a long way to go in matching the us response to 
exchange programs 
its a dramatic change compared to the past and the potential 
growth is quite exciting guroff said in 1988 for example 
about 15000 soviets will visit the united states while about 
120000 americans will travel to russia 
the 15000 figure high compared to the past is tiny when put 
into perspective guroff said china has sent about 15000 students 
to the united states as well as many more tourists

president reagan has vetoed major trade legislation amid signs 
that the nations export business is picking up 
reagan said he vetoed the legislation tuesday as expected 
because of his objections to a provision that would require 
companies to give their employees notice of plant closings and 
largescale layoffs 
i am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our 
economic growth reagan said in his veto message 
within hours the house voted 308113 to override the veto the 
margin was well above the twothirds majority required but it was 
thought unlikely that the senate would go along when it considers 
the override after a memorial day recess 
meanwhile the commerce department said orders for big 
ticket durables items expected to last three or more years rose 
08 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 1163 billion 
the climb followed gains of 09 percent in march and 01 percent 
in february orders in april were 85 percent greater than a year 
earlier 
the moderate increase in durable goods reinforced earlier 
signals of an improving trade picture some economists said 
it clearly shows that export orders are very strong said 
lawrence chimerine chairman of wefa group a philadelphiaarea 
economic forecasting firm 
the commerce department last week reported that us exports 
surged 23 percent in march to a record 29 billion with much of 
the strength coming in machinery aircraft and computers 
the declining value of the dollar which is less than half of 
what it was three years ago when measured against the japanese yen 
is bolstering sales of us goods overseas by making them cheaper 
when compared with foreign goods 
chimerine and david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer in new york said the cheaper 
dollar also is helping us manufacturers by boosting the cost of 
imported goods in the united states 
there are some hints that consumers are beginning to turn away 
from higherpriced imports in favor of domestic goods jones said 
with the signs of economic strength comes concern that 
production in industries is approaching capacity limits a 
development that could fuel price increases 
however chimerine said i think the fears of an inflationary 
boom have been exaggerated right from the start even with an 
upturn in exports were not in the midst of an economic boom

at a time when most seasoned investors were 
having trouble picking winning stocks 11 middle school students in 
decatur took 300000 in pretend money and turned a 154200 profit 
in 10 weeks of market action 
the rookie investors seventh and eighthgraders at renfroe 
middle school who formed three separate investment teams swept 
the top three places among 2700 teams that entered the statewide 
stockmarket game contest 
their money existed only on paper their transactions were fed 
into a computer at georgia state university not at the new york 
stock exchange 
all three winning teams portfolios increased by more than half 
during the contest while the dow jones industrial average rose 
just 13 percent if a teams initial 100000 investment had 
increased by the same amount as the dow it would have netted only 
1325 for a final portfolio of 101325 
the odds of three teams from the same school winning the top 
three spots are simply astronomical said david martin executive 
director of the georgia council on economic education which runs 
the 8yearold contest for georgia students in grades 612 
equally remarkably martin said all seven renfroe teams made a 
profit on their 100000 while only 22 percent of teams statewide 
managed to do so with the dow hovering close to 2000 throughout 
the contest 
the students analyzed companies and combed stock analyses with 
some teams profiting from huge purchases of lowcost stocks and 
others buying into wellmanaged firms whose stocks climbed slowly 
but surely 
the common denominator among the top three teams was their 
purchase of stock in blockbuster entertainment corp a 
dallasbased company that owns and operates some video rental 
stores and grants franchises for others 
students bought the stock for about 31 a share in february and 
early march to their delight the stock split 2for1 and within 
weeks the price of the newly split stock had climbed to about 24 
a share or 48 for each original share 
pat hone reallife stockbroker to renfroes school librarian 
karen allen had recommended blockbuster to ms allen as one of 
about 10 companies that the students might have fun with 
i gave the stock to other people as an idea said mrs hone 
but the price just kept climbing and climbing more cautious 
adults looked at it and said oh itll pull back and they 
didnt buy it

auto companies decisions to offer leaner 
incentives in midmay may have slowed domestic car sales but didnt 
hurt overall domestic vehicle sales which rose 26 percent from a 
year ago analysts said 
sales of domestically built cars which fell 22 percent in 
midmay from a year ago also dropped in the wake of an early may 
rush by buyers hurrying to beat the may 11 expiration of most 
majormaker incentive campaigns 
the eight companies that build cars and light trucks in the 
united states sold 345004 in the nine selling days from may 1120 
up from 336381 in the identical period a year ago the companies 
reported tuesday 
sales of domestic cars slipped to 216325 from 221127 while 
sales of light trucks rose 116 percent to 128679 from 115254 a 
year ago 
the companies think were moving into the strong spring 
selling season and can afford to take off incentives but every 
time they do car sales fall said kathleen heaney analyst with 
nikko securities co international in new york 
the incentive campaigns were extended but many rebates were 
trimmed and some models were removed 
sales have remained stronger than expected so far in 1988 
leading the big three to increase estimates of total 1988 vehicle 
sales import and domestic to 153 million from 15 million 
buying conditions have improved for consumers nationwide through 
lower interest rates strong income gains and low unemployment 
said ted sullivan analyst with wharton econometrics in 
philadelphia 
but much of the additional strength has come along the pacific 
and south atlantic coasts where the weakness of the dollar against 
foreign currencies has boosted sales of products such as textiles 
light machinery and lumber he said 
if the dollar does continue to weaken then the price gap 
between import and domestic goods will grow and youll get this 
boost in the interior section of the country which produces heavy 
industrial products sullivan said 
chrysler corp the no 3 us automaker sold 31 percent more 
domestic cars and 319 percent more domestic trucks during midmay 
than a year ago 
chryslers share of the domestic car market grew to 147 percent 
from 137 percent and its share of the domestic light truck market 
rose to 229 percent from 21 percent a year ago 
general motors corp the worlds largest automaker and the us 
industry leader sold 64 percent fewer domestic cars during the 
period than a year earlier but gms light truck sales rose 105 
percent 
gms share of the domestic car market slipped to 49 percent from

graduates and almost half of their companies said they seek 
humanities majors by recruiting on campus 
there is a very substantial hiring of liberal arts graduates 
by the nations major employers michael useem director of the 
universitys center for applied social science who conducted the 
survey said tuesday 
useem said companies with chief executives who advocate a broad 
education were out there hiring liberal arts graduates way above 
average 
the study completed earlier this month was sponsored by the 
corporate council on the liberal arts in collaboration with the 
presidents committee on the arts and humanities 
top corporate executives are more concerned than before 
certainly than in the 1970s about the overly narrow education of 
some of those who are applying for white collar jobs in the 
corporation useem said 
letters seeking information on hiring patterns were sent to the 
chief executives of the fortune 1000 the nations 1000 largest 
corporations and 200 midsize companies the survey had a 45 
percent response rate including more than half of the nations top 
100 companies 
in addition 505 middle and senior managers at large companies 
were interviewed by telephone about their career experiences 
working with other managers of varying educational backgrounds 
what weve seen in recent years is perhaps more employers have 
become convinced of the value of a liberal education in terms of 
their longrange needs said skip sturman director of career and 
employment services at dartmouth college in hanover nh 
increasing corporate competition in the united states and abroad 
has made students with diverse backgrounds more attractive the 
study showed 
some corporations are facing a much more competitive 
environment that places a premium on creativity and innovation and 
they want people who can easily move across boundaries think in an 
interdisciplinary way useem said 
a nationwide survey by the university of california at los 
angeles cited by useem found that student interest in liberal arts 
is rebounding after a 10year decline 
it found that 25 percent of firstyear college students reported 
an interest in a liberal arts major compared with a low of 21 
percent in the early 1980s but far below the 40 percent of 1970 
at the same time 27 percent of students said they were 
interested in business arts majors up from 24 percent in the early 
1980s and 16 percent in 1970 
companies are looking for students who can be trained in 
that specific industry but will bring to the company a broader 
thinker said liza bernard director of career development for 
haverford and bryn mawr colleges in suburban philadelphia 
bernard said oncampus recruiting by businesses has doubled 
since 1980 with about 60 companies seeking students last year at 
the two liberal arts colleges each of which have about 1200 
undergraduates 
the principle attractions for liberal arts students are better 
salaries to help pay off tuition debts and training that can be 
applied to other jobs 
if you do an undergraduate business degree and then a 
masters of business administration it seems to me the education 
is much too narrow said mary maples dunn president of smith 
college in northampton mass after all anyone who wants to make 
a success out of a life in business or anywhere else needs to have 
a broad understanding of the human condition 
at smith the largest of the nations womens liberal arts 
colleges economics was the second mostpopular major among this 
months graduates 177 in a class of 700

south koreas trade surplus with the 
united states shrank to 258 billion between january and april 
from 269 billion in the same period last year the trade and 
industry ministry reported today 
officials attributed the reduced surplus to efforts to increase 
imports from the united states and reduce imports from japan to 
correct the bilateral trade imbalance the source of friction with 
the reagan administration 
the ministry officials said the korean wons rise against the 
us dollar also slowed the pace of korean exports to the united 
states the won south koreas currency has risen 8 percent 
against the dollar since january 
south koreas trade deficit with japan during the januaryapril 
period shrank to 131 billion from 185 billion a year earlier 
the narrowed deficit with japan was attributed to brisk exports 
to japan helped by the strong japanese yen as well as less reliance 
on japan for machinery and raw materials 
south korean exports to the united states between january and 
april were tallied at 607 billion up 193 percent from a year 
earlier while imports equaled 349 billion up 458 percent 
south korean exports to japan jumped 591 percent to 356 
billion while imports from japan rose 191 percent to 487 
billion

some of the financial woes at eastern airlines must 
be laid at the door of parent texas air corp which even as it 
decries labor costs siphons money and assets from the miamibased 
carrier a new report says 
it is not possible for an airline to shrink its way to 
profitability says the report by touche ross amp co an 
international accounting and management consulting firm 
the report commissioned by the air line pilots association and 
criticized by eastern and texas spokesmen details the sale of 
eastern assets to texas air for what it called less than market 
value and the apparently heavy management fees eastern has paid 
texas air since it was purchased by the houstonbased company in 
1986 
management of texas air and eastern have defined easterns 
difficulties solely in terms of labor costs and unions yet 
nonunion continental lost substantially more than unionized 
eastern even after the adverse impact of the above transactions on 
eastern is taken into account says the report largely prepared 
by analyst farrell kupersmith 
without the above transactions the difference in performance 
at eastern and continental would have been even more dramatic 
with eastern performing substantially better than continental 
according to the report 
eastern lost 182 million last year compared to 258 million at 
continental also owned by texas air 
most of easterns losses and erosion of liquidity are because of 
upstreaming of payments and assets to texas air the report 
says 
texas air which lost a total 466 million last year is heavily 
leveraged with junk bonds is dependent on upstreaming of 
cash from its subsidiaries has overstated its liquidity and 
probably lacks credit standing for much new financial backing 
touche ross says 
texas air spokesman bruce hicks called the report a work of 
fiction 
the touche ross analysis is just replete with distortions and 
false assumptions robin matell an eastern spokesman said 
tuesday citing examples of figures he said were inflated in the 
report 
matell said the reports conclusions showed a lack of 
understanding of normal business practices 
the touche ross report cited 225 million paid by eastern to 
continental for strike preparation fees 6 million in management 
fees paid last year by eastern to texas air 91 million for 
administrative and fuel purchasing services paid to tac and tens 
of millions more paid for use of computers and reservations systems 
eastern which has indicated plans to reduce flying further this 
summer lost available passenger miles estimated worth 50 million 
to 75 million because of flying cutbacks the report says some 
routes were transferred to continental 
it is widely accepted that shrinking revenue raises cost per 
available seat mile and results in an exaggeration of losses the 
report says 
the touche ross report notes that eastern attempted to sell its 
profitable northeast shuttle to texas air to become a subsidiary a 
machinists union federal lawsuit has blocked it there has also 
been talk of selling easterns latin american routes 
matell said such transactions as the sale of the systems one 
reservations system to texas air injected badly needed cash into 
eastern he said the fees eastern now pays for use of the 
reservations system are less than what easterns own cost of 
operating the system would be 
the management fees are a miniscule fraction of operating 
costs he said 
texas air contends that eastern labor costs are too high and 
that the unions must make some concessions eastern is locked in 
federal mediation with its largest union the 12000member 
international association of machinists local 
the department of transportation is expected to soon release the 
results of its own study announced april 13 into the ability of 
texas air to run airlines a us house resolution has questioned 
texas airs commitment to keeping eastern viable 
in washington on tuesday federally mediated hearings opened to 
settle a bitter dispute between airline unions and texas air over 
whether eastern and continental should be considered a single 
airline for bargaining purposes

the government expressed relief wednesday after 
us president ronald reagan vetoed an omnibus trade bill providing 
for sanctions against a japanese electronics maker and retaliation 
against countries that violate international trade agreements 
the relief was qualified however by a vote overriding the veto 
in the us house of representatives and the reasons behind 
reagans disapproval of the bill 
speaking to reporters at his official residence prime minister 
noboru takeshita welcomed the veto and added concern now is 
primarily on domestic issues in the united states when the 
negotiations between the white house and congress begin the 
issues most affecting japan will be brought out 
during a news conference hajime tamura minister of 
international trade and industry said our ministry has in the 
past requested efforts from the united states government to see 
that the trade bill would not be enacted and we welcome president 
reagans veto 
opposition to the bill in japan stems mainly from provisions 
requiring retaliation against violations of international trade 
agreements and other unjustifiable practices 
if enacted the bill would transfer from the president to the 
us trade representive the authority to decide what unfair trade 
practices another country is engaged in and what if any 
retaliatory measures to impose 
a provision imposing sanctions against toshiba corp and one of 
its subsidiaries toshiba machine co for the subsidiarys sales 
of sensitive equipment to the soviet union also concerns the 
japanese 
no mention of the toshiba sanctions was made in reagans veto 
message which focused on curbs on exports of alaskan oil and a 
mandatory requirement forcing businesses to give employees advance 
warning of closures or layoffs 
toshiba machine corp sold the soviets milling machines that 
could be used to make submarine propellers quieter and more 
difficult to detect the sales violated international rules 
regulating trade between the west and communist countries 
tamura said he hopes congress will support reagan and that the 
bill will not be passed but he added for us foreigners it 
is very hard to say what will happen in the united states 
the house overrode the veto with a margin well above the 
twothirds majority required but it was thought unlikely that the 
senate would go along when it considers the override after next 
weeks memorial day recess

a top us beef industry representative on 
wednesday praised the hardline approach by us negotiators in 
farm trade talks with japan and predicted a favorable bilateral 
beef agreement would be concluded by the end of may 
philip seng asia director of the us meat export federation 
said recent concessions by the japanese government should serve to 
break an impasse in talks to renew a beef and citrus fruit pact 
that expired in march 
our governments approach of hardlining it has already 
paid dividends as far as the us beef industry is concerned 
i think hopefully we can actually realize a bilateral agreement 
within the month said seng whose federation represents major 
us farm organizations and businesses 
last week prime minister noboru takeshita instructed the 
government party to seek a speedy solution to the dispute brought 
about by us demands for full access to japans beef and orange 
markets he leaves next monday for an official visit to the united 
states 
other government officials including japans ambassador to 
washington have also indicated recently that an agreement was 
expected soon 
bilateral talks to settle the beef and orange issue broke down 
in april after washington flatly rejected a japanese plan to 
counterbalance marketopening measures with variable surcharges on 
beef imports aimed at bringing import prices up to domestic levels 
but seng said the ruling liberal democratic party strongly 
dependent on the rural vote was prepared to scrap the levy or 
surcharge and retain the present tariffs 
ldp secretary general shintaro abe indicated that they will 
just have a tariff at the end of the day seng said other 
officials have indicated that they would raise their quota of 
us beef imports to 40000 metric tons per annum for the next 
three to four years thats a substantial increase over the 
9000metricton annual increases that weve enjoyed so far 
seng also said a bilateral beef agreement would include a 
reduction in the power of the livestock industry promotion 
corporation which controls some 80 percent of beef sold throughout 
japan 
he ruled out a us move to abolish the quasigovernmental 
organization that slaps a 50 percent tax on imported beef prior to 
the complicated wholesale stage 
rather than trying to attack the lipc openfaced the us 
strategy is to effect change meaningful change in the role of 
the lipc and limit the amount of control that they do have 
on may 4 the united states brought the dispute to the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade a genevabased forum to rule on 
international trade disputes but both us and japanese officials 
have maintained they will continue efforts to forge a new agreement 
out of gatt 
us beef shipments to japan account for some 85 percent of the 
193 million pounds the nation exports annually worth some 600 
million that figure says seng could be multiplied by three to 
four times if japan fully liberalizes its market

farm equipment manufacturer deere amp co says 
an improved farm economy helped boost its net earnings in the 
second quarter by 145 percent compared with the yearago period 
north american retail sales of john deere agricultural and 
industrial equipment during fiscal 1988 have increased 
significantly over last years levels chairman robert a hanson 
said in a statement tuesday 
deere reported net income of 864 million or 126 per share 
for the three months ended april 30 compared with 353 million 
or 52 cents per share for the same period a year ago 
net sales increased 27 percent from 114 billion to 145 
billion the company said 
during the remainder of the year we expect retail sales 
to exceed those in the final half of 1987 hanson said 
worldwide production of all deere products in 1988 was scheduled 
to be about 30 percent higher than actual 1987 output he noted 
the agricultural economy has continued to strengthen in 1988 
with improvement in a number of important agricultural economic 
indicators hanson said price competition remains keen in our 
markets but the fundamentals of our businesses are stronger and 
our operating results greatly improved 
gary benjamin of the federal reserve bank of chicago agreed that 
deere had been helped by a turnaround in the agricultural economy 
noting that record high farm earnings of 55 billion were posted in 
1987 
earnings this year are expected to be close to last years 
record high benjamin said that is helping to improve farmland 
values farmers feel a little more confident now about going out 
and making capital expenditures 
deeres net income for the first six months of 1988 was about 
154 million compared with last years net loss of 157 million 
which included the adverse effects of a strike through the first 
quarter 
analysts said the weak dollar probably helped deeres exports to 
increase by 36 percent to 340 million from 251 million last year 
they also noted that deere has drastically cut its workforce in 
the past nine years lowering employment costs steven colbert of 
prudentialbache securities inc said deere employment last year 
was only 37931 compared with 65392 in 1979

bat industries plc said wednesday its 
firstquarter pretax profit rose 141 percent over a year ago on 
a robust performance by its tobacco operations 
that performance more than offset a decline in contributions 
from financial services and disappointing results in the united 
states the company said 
pretax profit for the first three months of 1988 came to 283 
million pounds or 529 million at current exchange rates that was 
up from 248 million pounds in the yearearlier period 
net profit increased 14 percent to 163 million pounds or 305 
million compared with 143 million pounds in the 1987 first 
quarter the company said 
revenues gained 42 percent to 397 billion pounds or 742 
billion from 381 billion pounds 
the company said the adverse effects of currency movements 
reduced pretax profit by 17 million pounds or 32 million in the 
latest period this reflected the pounds gains against european 
currencies it said 
tobacco operations contributed 163 million pounds or 305 
million to operating profit up from 120 million pounds helped in 
part by strong gains in exports to japan following greater opening 
of the japanese market to imported cigarettes bat chairman patrick

the us trade deficit shrank by 127 percent 
from january through march the biggest improvement in five years 
the government reported today 
the commerce department reported that the difference between 
what the united states imports and what it exports totaled 359 
billion for the first three months of 1988 down from a deficit of 
412 billion in the last three months of 1987 
the 127 percent decline represented a dramatic turnaround in a 
deficit that has steadily worsened oveyears it was 
the biggest quarterly improvement since an 189 percent decline in 
the fourth quarter of 1982 
the new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown 
up in the departments montr the last five hly merchandise trade reports 
the 
earlier figures showed a 164 percent drop in the deficit to 36 
billion in the first quarter compared to 431 billion in the 
fourth quarter 
todays figures are smaller because they subtracted factors such 
as the cost of shipping and insurance and military sales from the 
monthly numbers the balanceofpayments deficit is also adjusted 
for seasonal variations the monthly figures are not 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the improvement in the first quarted the fact that 
exports climbed faster than imports although both hit alltime 
highs 
exports jumped 98 percent to a record 747 billion while 
imports rose 13 percent to a record 1106 billion 
the administration is counting on strong export sales to provide 
close to half of total economic growth in the united states this 
year the figures for the first quarter show that this estimate is 
on track 
president reagan has also pointed to the improvement in the 
trade deficit as an argument against passing protectionist trade 
legislation reagan on tuesday vetoed the omnibus trade bill and 
republicans in the senate are expected to cite the big drop in the 
trade deficit as a strong argument that this would be the wrong 
time to threaten trade retaliation against other countries who are 
purchasing record levels of us products 
exports of both agricultural and nonagricultural goods 
increased in the first quarter 
the trade deficit with japan fell by 19 billion to 129 
billion the trade deficit with western europe dropped by an even 
sharper 38 billion to 45 billion the deficit with the newly 
industrialized countries of singapore hong kong south korea and 
taiwan fell to 11 billion to 69 billion

federal regulators have given bank of new york 
corp a 45day extension for completing its hostile tender offer 
for irving bank co and the unwanted suitor extended its bid until 
the end of this week 
the federal reserve boards action tuesday prompted new york 
state supreme court justice herman cahn to delay acting on bank of 
new yorks challenge to irvings latest antitakeover poison 
pill defense 
meanwhile tuesday irving reinstated its board of directors 
after a final count showed it had beaten bank of new york in the 
bitter proxy battle for control of the company 
cahn also set up a briefing schedule for bank of new yorks 
challenge of the election results the company must submit 
supporting documents by next tuesday and a hearing on the issue 
will be held by june 3 
bank of new york had asked federal regulators for an extension 
to consummate its proposed takeover of irving which has been 
stalled by a number of factors including a series of lawsuits the 
outcome of the proxy fight and from irvings poison pill 
although the fed granted a 45day extension tuesday it noted it 
was concerned about some possible adverse affects of the merger 
the board required bank of new york to notify the fed when it had 
acquired 5 percent of irvings shares and obtain the boards 
permission before proceeding with the takeover 
the fed had given bank of new york conditional approval for the 
merger in february that approval was scheduled to expire on today 
bank of new york has maintained it will proceed with its 11 
billion tender offer and run irving as a separate subsidiary 
regardless of whether it could win control of irvings board the 
offer is for 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its stock for each of 
irvings 185 million common shares outstanding 
it was set to expire at midnight tuesday although it was 
extended until midnight friday and conditioned upon bank of new 
york receiving at least 67 percent of irvings shares as of last 
monday bank of new york held about a 50 percent stake in irving 
including shares it owned and those tendered 
irving recently took steps to prevent bank of new york from 
proceeding with its tender offer last week it amended its 
poison pill so that it would be activated should any unwanted 
investor acquire at least 20 percent of irving shares on the open 
market the poison pill previously would have gone into effect in 
the event of a takeover not supported by management 
poison pill defenses are designed to discourage takeover bids by 
greatly increasing the cost of an acquisition in irvings case 
all existing shareholders except bank of new york would be allowed 
to buy irving shares for halfprice once bank of new york acquired 
20 percent of irving shares 
irving has steadfastly rejected bank of new york takeover 
proposals instead opting for a friendly merger with the staterun 
banca commerciale italiana spa italys second largest bank 
the company announced today that its board unanimously approved 
banca commerciales sweetened cash offer of 80 a share for a 51 
percent stake in irving the revised bid up 5 a share from the 
previous offer was conditional on irving keeping intact the latest 
antitakeover defense it adopted to fend off bank of new york 
the banca commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring 
plan that includes sale of irving assets several costcutting 
measures and a special 10 dividend the proposal still needs 
regulatory approval 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said his company has no 
plans to raise its tender offer 
the company had proposed increasing the stock portion if irving 
agreed to hold friendly talks and dismantle its poison pill 
defense but irvings board of directors unanimously rejected that 
proposal last week 
in a reconvened annual shareholders meeting tuesday irving 
said its shareholders reelected the incumbent board over bank of 
new yorks slate of 16 nominees by 52 percent to 48 percent the 
count confirmed preliminary results that were released earlier this 
month 
brady said it would file suit in new york state supreme court to 
declare the results invalid the company claimed that four irving 
shareholders with more than 950000 shares of irving stock 
confirmed that their votes were improperly counted

a federal appeals court has upheld a ruling 
temporarily forbidding hallmark cards inc from making greeting 
card designs resembling those of a small competitor clearing the 
way for a full trial of the companys 50 million damage suit 
against hallmark 
blue mountain arts has pushed the bullies back to the alley 
weve been waiting and waiting on the ruling and its entirely in 
our favor said bob gall general manager of the boulder 
colobased company which won the injunction we are absolutely 
ecstatic 
blue mountain brought suit against hallmark based in kansas 
city mo in july 1986 alleging that hallmarks personal 
touch line of greeting cards is deceptively similar to blue 
mountains airebrush feelings and watercolor feelings lines 
blue mountain alleged that hallmark was guilty of unfair 
competition and copyright infringement 
a federal court ruled in november 1986 that blue mountains two 
card lines have an inherently distinctive and highly uniform 
overall appearance that is recognizable and attributable to blue 
mountain 
it ordered hallmark to stop producing and marketing 83 specific 
greeting card designs 
the blue mountain cards are characterized by backgrounds of soft 
colors done with air brush blends or light watercolor strokes 
in april hallmark appealed the injunction order arguing that a 
single greeting card company should not have perpetual rights to 
a style of art a style of text and a concept of their combined 
use 
in tuesdays decision the 10th us circuit court of appeals 
affirmed the injunction saying the lower court was correct in 
determining that the combination of features comprising the trade 
dress or the overall appearance of blue mountains cards can be 
protected 
a date for a full trial is expected to be scheduled now that the 
appeal has been decided blue mountain is seeking 50 million in 
damages from hallmark and will fight what they consider hallmarkss 
other copycat card designs 
its not only a victory for stephen and me and for blue 
mountain but its also a victory for the arts and for all creative 
people said susan polis schutz a poet who cofounded blue 
mountain with her husband stephen schutz 
polis schutz said blue mountains main complaint was the look of 
the cards which she said confused everyone including myself 
this decision means you can create something and not have to 
worry about it being stolen she said one of the things that 
stephen and i learned is that it is possible to stand up for your 
rights no matter how small you are or how big your opponent is 
charles w hucker a spokesman for the greeting card giant said 
tuesday night that hallmark was disappointed but not surprised by 
the decision 
we will consider making a further appeal it is important to 
understand that this is a preliminary decision based on a limited 
airing of the issues hucker said we will have the opportunity 
to present our case in full for the first time at the trial 
hucker noted that the blue mountain suit contended hallmark 
copied the smaller companys look 
it is absolutely not true and they know its not true that 
we copied specific designs he said

small companies still hunger to see their names 
on a filigreed stock certificate but its a luxury few can afford 
these days 
the companies that can make a convincing sales pitch for their 
stock to a jittery postcrash wall street are those with 
substantial track records and solid innovative products 
but other young companies are shrinking from the prospect of 
selling stock at firesale prices and instead are knocking on the 
doors of venture capitalists who may ask for a few board seats in 
return for capital 
industry insiders say the market crash and its aftershocks have 
been devastating for lessdeveloped companies by limiting the 
financial tools they depend on 
a lot of companies wont be financed and it will lead to a 
pruning out a survival of the fittest one expert said 
since last octobers black monday the number of initial public 
offerings raising 25 million or less a size typical for small 
companies has fallen off dramatically 
in april 1987 28 such offerings were recorded raising a total 
of 2054 million according to idd information services inc last 
month only 10 offerings were made for a mere 532 million the 
intervening months saw even fewer new issues 
a pervasive lack of investor confidence is the main reason it 
has become almost impossible for companies without a strong 
record of earnings or strong evidence of exceptionally powerful 
technology to go public said martin orland president of amev 
venture management inc 
many companies simply scrapped their plans after the oct 19 
market collapse orland had three companies that had registered 
with the securities and exchange commission to issue stock but 
they aborted their plans rather than slash the offering price 
pulse engineering inc a san diego maker of electronic 
components that hoped to raise about 15 million by selling shares 
for between 9 and 10 was one of those companies 
orland said the stock price would have been substantially 
lower had the company decided to go ahead with the issue in the 
wake of the crash instead the group was able to secure additional 
bank financing 
not all companies are that fortunate 
a lot cant fill the gap and we are seeing many situations of 
aborted public offerings coming to us for financing orland said 
but money from venture capitalists is exchanged for a piece of 
ownership forcing management to decide how much control they are 
willing to give up 
for young companies the alternatives can be limited some have 
opted to go public anyway at lower offering prices while others 
are bootstrapping their way along simply growing slower without 
the funds still others are seeking mergers or equity links to 
larger corporations 
neorx corp a seattlebased biotechnology firm had registered 
with the sec in march to raise 30 million but has since witnessed 
a deterioration in the market particularly in biotechnology and 
pharmaceutical stocks said chief financial officer robert 
littauer 
in the meantime littauer said the company is looking for other 
methods of financing until the market turns around so far the 
company has held discussions with a japanese company and a european 
firm 
we would be doing that anyway littauer said but we might 
make the terms more responsive to our current situation we might 
ask for a larger upfront payment so we can use it as a tool to 
help our current financial situation 
companies that are braving the stock markets choppy waters are 
established often showing annual revenue in excess of 50 million 
clean harbors inc a bostonbased hazardous waste firm with 50 
million in annual revenue raised 10 million last november shares 
that initially sold for 9 each are now trading in the 14 range 
sandy robertson a partner in the san francisco investment 
banking firm robertson colman amp stephens inc attributed the 
issues success to institutional investors who understood the 
hazardous waste business which he described as immune from the 
economy as a whole 
another market survivor is tampa flabased silk greenhouse 
inc a budding retail chain of artificial flowers whose stock 
traded as high as 16 a share after intially selling at 11 
the market saw it as a new unique retailing concept 
robertson explained 
in addition to providing companies with needed working capital 
going public has more subtle benefits entrepreneurs and small 
business owners agree there is a certain status to being 
publicly held 
it makes a company seem much more substantial and thats very 
important to many of our customers said edward wilner president 
of the 4yearold long island software developer software 
performance group inc 
it conveys the impression were here to stay and its 
important to original investors to have a mechanism for cashing in 
on their investment said wilner who saw his own plans to issue 
stock delayed by three months software performance currently is 
scheduled to go public in september rather than june 
wilner noted that the small size of the offering the company 
is seeking to raise only between 2 million and 3 million helped 
insulate it from postcrash queasiness 
there are still underwriters and investment bankers that need 
to make a living wilner noted ironically he found the crash 
actually left us with an opportunity because there are not a 
lot of companies left to do an offering and a strong company that 
is set up properly actually is more attractive now 
indeed for venture capitalists who often specialize in 
earlystage financing business is busy 
were looking at more were traveling more but were being 
discriminatory orland said 
while investors may not be attracted by the potential of 
handsome returns that go handinhand with speculative deals 
venture capitalists have before them some significantly undervalued 
companies 
people ask if the market window for financing is open or 
shut but the market really is like a filter robertson 
explained after the crash the market is tougher and the filter 
is finer but fine companies if you will the really good 
companies can get through theres billions out there

when the publication newsweek on campus was 
first sent to college nearly six years ago its owners hoped 
students would read it and later graduate to its parent newsweek 
not enough students made the step up however and newsweek inc 
recently announced that newsweek on campus will make its final 
appearance this fall 
it wont be the only dropout among college magazines although 
their reasons for calling it quits vary 
mcgrawhill inc announced that it was suspending publication of 
the 5yearold business week careers magazine citing lagging 
advertising support for campus publications 
and whittle communications a media concern based in knoxville 
tenn published the final issue of its 17yearold campus voice 
magazine in march saying it had become too hard to stand out from 
the crowd of college magazines 
media analysts say a shakeout was inevitable as the number of 
magazines newspapers billboards sampling programs and other 
media options aimed at college students mushroomed in the mid1980s 
publishers felt advertisers would salivate at the chance to 
reach an audience numbering about 12 million with estimated 
purchasing power of about 30 billion a year malleable brand 
loyalties and promising earnings prospects 
the audience remains attractive for some advertisers such as 
those in automotives electronics beverages and snack foods but 
their ad budgets have limits said leo scullin director of print 
media for the advertising agency young amp rubicam 
with a preponderance of media vehicles available the 
advertiser made his choices scullin said he said they tended to 
pick magazines with pizazz and excitement because there was a 
better chance students would look at them 
randy achee president of alan weston communications inc a 
burbank califbased company that publishes three magazines 
targeted at segments of the college audience estimated national 
advertisers spend about 35 million a year specifically to reach 
college students 
that figure includes only product and service advertising not 
recruitment advertising or local and regional ad spending which 
achee said could push total spending toward 100 million a year 
achee said his company has survived the shakeout by focusing on 
narrow segments of the college market and using the mail instead of 
simply leaving the magazines at hightraffic spots on campus 
westons moving up magazine is sent to about 500000 men who are 
college juniors seniors or graduate students college woman goes 
to about 700000 women who are college students and college 
musician goes to 100000 college music students through their 
teachers 
even those who are closing magazines say the audience remains 
attractive 
newsweek intends to promote its main magazine more aggressively 
on campus mcgrawhill plans to offer advertisers a chance to be 
the only sponsor of special editions of business week careers 
whittle plans multipanel wallboards for the campus that will carry 
news features job information and advertising 
gerard smith the publisher of newsweek inc said newsweek on 
campus was never intended to be a major profit contributor it was 
launched in september 1982 as a way of introducing college 
students to newsweeks style of reporting and editing he said 
the strategy didnt work although newsweek on campus 
circulation reached 13 million this year smith said there was 
insufficient indication that readers later subscribed to newsweek 
and some evidence that the number of students reading newsweek 
itself had dipped it appeared six times a year and its last issue 
will be the backtoschool edition this fall 
smith said newsweek on campus was at a disadvantage in selling 
ad space because some competitors who publish magazines also 
offered sampling programs and other promotions aimed at college 
students weston for instance offers sampling direct mail and 
college newspaper ad placement services a movie guide and campus 
promotions as well as magazines 
time inc plans to continue publishing its student life college 
magazine twice a year but is launching other services to reach 
college students student life publisher jonathan bulkeley said 
marketers will have a chance to advertise in student life 
distribute a sample of their products through college bookstores 
assembled by time and give away coupons through posters on campus 
or by direct mail 
standalone magazines have a tough time being successful in 
this market he said advertisers are interested in more than 
just print

federal regulators and senators today offered 
a cautiously upbeat view of the prospects for a rebound this year 
of the nations banks which in 1987 suffered their worst year 
since the depression 
the regulators testifying before the senate banking committee 
noted two longstanding problems dragging down banking as a whole 
shaky loans to third world countries and bank failures in 
southwestern states whose economies are heavily dependent on oil 
there are two areas of concern said the comptroller of the 
currency robert clarke whose office regulates nationally 
chartered banks but they should not overshadow the fact that the 
national banking system remains sound 
in the troubled southwestern states of texas oklahoma and 
louisiana which accounted for more than half of the 
postdepression record of 184 bank failures last year the worst 
may be over he said 
sen william proxmire dwis agreed that the picture this 
year is by no means gloomy but he warned that the financial 
devastation in texas could be an indication of what lies ahead if 
the national economy turns downward 
what haunts me is that texas today might be the united states 
tomorrow if we have a national recession he said 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures bank deposits up to 100000 said many banks 
are prepared to withstand a short recession with few ill effects 
he added the fdic fund is adequate to deal with any problems 
we can forsee in the banking system in 1988 
by any measure 1987 was a disaster for the nations 13650 
commercial banks the industry as a whole recorded a profit of only 
37 billion on 3 trillion in assets the worst performance since 
1933 
the nations largest banks set aside reserves in anticipation of 
losses on loans to third world countries nine of the 10 largest 
banks in the nation and 17 of the 25 largest recorded a loss for 
the year 
federal reserve board governor h robert heller said 
meaningful progress has been achieved on the third world debt 
problem 
leaders in a number of borrowing countries have recognized the 
need to restructure their economies he said 
seidman in a trip to san antonio texas last week said that 
texas banks would hit bottom in 1988 and improve next year he has 
been predicting that bank failures in texas should climb from 50 in 
1987 to 70 this year but that improvements elsewhere should hold 
bank failures nationally to about the same level as last year 
one substantial but known cloud on the horizon is first 
republicbank corp of dallas in march the fdic infused 1 billion 
into banks owned by the huge holding company with the idea of 
coming up with a permanent rescue package within six months 
the ailing giant likely will cause the insurance fund which 
stood at 183 billion at the end of 1987 to register its first 
loss in its 55year history 
according to an audit of the fdic released last month by the 
general accounting office an investigating arm of congress bank 
profits probably will improve despite a continued high level of 
bank failures and continuing and longterm problems presented 
by third world debt 
last month 12 of the 15 largest bank holding companies reported 
increased earnings for the first quarter of this year 
the banking committee hearing today is the second session on the 
condition of us financial institutions the first last week 
reviewed the state of savings institutions where much of congress 
attention has been focused 
compared with banks the 3120 federally insured thrifts are in 
much worse shape as a whole posting a 68 billion loss last year 
the sampl insurance fund has been hardpressed to cope with mounting 
insolvencies

the securities and exchange commission has 
decided not to take action against wall street underwriters and 
others who helped offer washington public power supply system bonds 
that eventually flopped in the biggest municipal bond default ever 
a published report said today 
the wall street journal quoting unidentified sources said the 
commissions report is basically complete but that it is not 
expected to be sent to congress until the sec completes a proposal 
that would tighten up disclosure in the municipal bond market 
wppss defaulted on 225 billion in bonds sold for construction 
of two nuclear power plants in washington state the plants wppss 
nos 4 and 5 were abandoned in january 1982 and default occurred 
18 months later 
the journals sources said sec staff had recommended earlier 
that the agency take enforcement action against certain parties 
including underwriters 
but the sources said sec chairman david ruder feared such an 
approach would tie up the commissions resources for years in such 
a complex case and that a decision was made against taking 
enforcement action 
chiles larson spokesman for the sec told the associated press 
today he did not expect any official comment on the newspaper 
account he also said he did not know or could not say how widely 
the investigations findings to date had been circulated 
dennis fitzgibbons communications director for the house energy 
committee said he had not seen a copy of the investigation report 
and could not verify the newspaper story 
rep ron wyden dore a member of the investigations 
subcommittee of the house energy committee said he could not 
confirm the report 
if these sources are correct what it does is confirm the old 
adage if youre going to mess up do it big because people might 
not have the resources to do anything about it thats if this 
report is correct 
john britton spokesman for wppss said of the published report 
if that is true it is good news 
in march 1987 wppss disclosed that sec lawyers had informally 
advised supply system officials that they planned to recommend the 
commission file a civil action against wppss for fraud wppss said 
at that time it believed it was innocent and would vigorously 
defend itself 
the sec investigation was reportedly to have been released 
earlier this year and it has become an issue of concern in the 
huge federalcourt lawsuit filed by bondholders over wppsss bond 
default defendants include wppss utilities that contracted for 
the two terminated plants bond underwriters attorneys and others 
major wall street firms that served as underwriters in the 
selling of wppss bonds agreed last september to settle their part 
of the case for 92 million however some bondholders have argued 
that figure does not adequately reflect the underwriters 
involvement in the alleged fraud especially if the sec 
investigation finds in favor of enforcement action 
trial for the case dubbed multidistrict level 551 is 
scheduled for sept 7 in tucson ariz 
larson said it was unusual that the secs investigation had 
become public knowledge at all he said the commission was forced 
by the 9th us circuit court of appeals to disclose subpoenas it 
was issuing several years ago in its investigation since then he 
said the supreme court ruled against the 9th circuit in the matter 
and the investigation once again gained its mantle of secrecy

american airlines announced a multibillion 
dollar purchase of as many as 100 boeing 757s today the second big 
order for the aircraft maker this month 
under the arrangement american will acquire 50 757s with an 
option to purchase 50 more american chairman robert crandall would 
not disclose a dollar amount but analysts have said the order is 
worth up to 42 billion 
american will take delivery of the planes starting in 1989 they 
are primarily designed as replacement airplanes for the aging 737s 
and 727s in americans fleet 
the 194passenger 757 jetliner with a range of about 3200 
miles burns 25 percent less fuel than comparable aircraft and will 
be powered by two rolls royce engines 
overall this is a transaction that gives american on 
excellent terms a highly efficient new airplane that can make our 
fleet more efficient and productive and allow us to save truly 
impressive sums of money in the years ahead crandall told a news 
conference here 
analysts have said seattlebased boeing co could break previous 
records in 1988 a decade after the aerospace giant introduced the 
twinengine jetliner so far this year boeing has had 276 aircraft 
ordered compared with just 88 ordered at this time last year 
the new york times meanwhile reported that allegis corp the 
parent of united airlines was considering ordering as many as 60 
of the 757s worth an estimated 25 billion to 29 billion 
allegis spokesman joe hopkins in chicago would neither confirm 
nor deny such an order was pending or say whether allegis was 
negotiating with boeing we simply dont comment on rumors like 
that hopkins said tuesday 
so far this year boeing has received orders for 40 757s from 
the time boeing announced development of the plane in 1978 through 
the end of 1987 just 239 of the planes had been ordered 
it was just a matter of time before the 757 would grow into 
its time analyst david smith of robert elsworth and co in 
washington dc said tuesday 
the companys previous largest order was just last week a 46 
billion deal for 100 planes being purchased by international lease 
finance corp of beverly hills calif 
even with the possibility of 160 additional orders boeing 
spokesman jack gamble said boeing had no immediate plans to add 
workers to its 757 production line at renton wash or to increase 
output from the current four 757s a month the line has a capacity 
of about seven planes a month gamble said 
any large orders would lengthen the life of the production run 
and stabilize work schedules he said 
orders are indicators of future business for boeing since the 
company isnt paid by customers until planes are delivered 
paul nisbet aerospace analyst at prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york said the american order means the time has come 
for an aircraft program that was the fly in the ointment for 
boeing he said 
new orders he said may turn what has been a continuousloss 
program into what will be a continuous fullproduction line 
nisbet said the large international lease order and rush of 
interest in the 757 may be the start of a bonanza year for boeing 
it may encourage everyone to hurry up and get their place in 
line he said if they want new aircraft delivered before the 
mid1990s 
boeing had a record 202 billion in commercial jet orders for 
1987 but nisbet said 1988 could see orders reaching 25 billion 
boeing intended the 757 which first flew in 1982 as the 
eventual replacement for the aging 727 trijet which went into 
service in 1964 
the new plane is quieter than a 727 far more fuelefficient 
features a computerized cockpit and can be flown by a crew of two 
instead of three it also costs 41 million to 47 million which 
analysts say was enough to scare away new buyers when the price of 
oil fell in the early 1980s 
when fuel went down it became feasible to operate 727s with 
three pilots and big gaseating engines said william whitlow 
analyst for dain bosworth inc in seattle 
there was not a need to replace 727s that were fully written 
off as far as costs were concerned as long as fuel costs were 
low nisbet said but maybe were seeing that 20yearold 
airplanes are not worth flying because of higher maintenance 
fuel and crew costs 
both whitlow and nisbet said that with airports becoming more 
congested the 757 is attractive because of its passenger capacity 
and nisbet noted that if you want an airplane delivered before 
1991 in the small to midsize range the 757 is the one to pick 
since mcdonnell douglas corps md80 airbus industries a320 and 
boeings smaller 737 series are all pretty well booked 
boeing does not release profit or loss figures on individual 
programs but smith nisbet and whitlow all said a new round of 
major orders should be enough to make the 757 a moneymaker

launderers in the gold rush 130 years ago today theyre flying in 
from hong kong with millions of dollars to invest in businesses and 
real estate 
for the large majority canada is a hedge against hong kongs 
reversion to chinese communist sovereignty in 1997 
while hong kong entrepreneurs find easy entry under canadas 
investor immigrant program hospitals in toronto and vancouver 
in british columbia report an increase in the number of hong kong 
women who come to have babies because the infants automatically 
become canadian citizens 
other chinese come as students and professionals 
but the entrepreneurs and investors often get a special welcome 
they have no problem flipping down 5 million dollars 4 
million for a house because in hong kong it would be 20 million 
16 million said premier david peterson of ontario 
one recent buyer was stanley ho whose casino and ferry empire 
in hong kong and macao makes him one of asias richest men he paid 
55 million canadian dollars 44 million for a 25room mansion 
on bridle path torontos millionaires row

16 billion a year half of it in real estate hong kong chinese 
own onethird of the shopping malls in the toronto suburb of 
scarborough one of three metropolitan chinatowns 
edward hou a canadianchinese community leader said his real 
estate company deals with 100 hong kong investors a month 
after the first chinese came for the gold rush and later to work 
on the construction of the canadian pacific railway canada 
discouraged further immigration by imposing a tax of 50 a head on 
new arrivals those who stayed were denied citizenship until 1947 
today 600000 canadians are of chinese descent including more 
than 200000 in toronto and 175000 in vancouver

soybean futures closed sharply lower wednesday on

futures prices also fell 
technical factors also entered into the fray wednesday analysts 
said attitudes turned bearish after an effort to push the price 
for november delivery of soybeans beyond 808 a bushel the 
contracts lifetime high stalled at 807 
a sharp drop in cash prices for argentine soybean meal also 
weighed on the soybean complex said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
but overpowering everything else is the weather he said 
they are saying there will be more rain early next week than 
previously anticipated 
weather has been the dominant factor in the grain and soybean 
markets since april when government reports indicated a large 1988 
soybean crop would be needed to prevent a substantial tightening of 
supplies 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 8 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 341 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 4 cents lower with july at 214 a bushel oats were 2 cents

kidder peabody amp co denied a published report 
wednesday that it is considering putting some traders on a fourday 
work week because of slackened activity on wall street 
the wall street journal quoted unidentified kidder officials as 
saying the investment firm might shift some securities traders and 
some institutional sales personnel to a shorter work week during 
the summer 
a memo distributed wednesday to all kidder employees nationwide 
said the journals story is not true 
kidder chairman silas cathcart and president max chapman jr 
said in the memo that at no time has kidder peabody considered 
placing professional traders or sales personnel on a fourday work 
week 
steve swartz the journal reporter who wrote the story said he 
stood by his story 
the journal said the move would save kidder money by cutting 
stock and bond traders compensation in exchange for the extra day 
off 
the paper said kidder was considering a plan to operate with at 
least some traders on hand at all times while securities markets 
are open 
the journal said such a move would be highly unusual but 
reflected lethargic times on wall street since octobers stock 
market crash 
trading volume has been unusually low on monday for example 
only 1026 million shares traded hands on the new york stock 
exchange the lightest level since thanksgiving bond trading also 
has tapered off

singlefamily homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 348 million units last month following increases of 25

prices which fell by 200 to 87700 compared to march however 
the resale price of a home was still 2 percent higher than a year 
ago when the median price of a home was 86000

business failures declined by 101 percent in 
the first quarter over a year ago as more farmers and retailers 
climbed out of the red a report released wednesday said 
dun amp bradstreet corp a businessinformation concern said 
15211 businesses nationwide went under during the first three 
months of this year compared with 16924 in 1987 
joseph w duncan dun amp bradstreets chief economist said 75 
percent of the improvement was due to a decline in failures in the 
agriculture and retailing sectors 
firstquarter retailing failures slipped 17 percent to 2918 
from 3515 while agriculture failures plunged 53 percent to 596 
from 1266 
the strong levels of consumer demand that characterized the 
early years of the current economic expansion also resulted in a 
high level of entrepreneurial activity in retailing duncan said 
he attributed the improvement in the agriculture sector to the 
introduction of chapter 12 into the federal bankruptcy laws 
chapter 12 protects farmers from their creditors while allowing 
them to reorganize 
other large declines in business failures included mining down 
53 percent transportation and public utilities down 132 percent 
manufacturing down 111 percent and construction down 98 
percent dun amp bradstreet said 
by region the westsouthcentral states texas arkansas 
oklahoma and louisiana fared the best with business failures 
down nearly 30 percent but the south atlantic states new york 
new jersey and pennsylvania had a 68 percent jump in failures 
until further data are available in 1988 it will be difficult 
to tell if the trend in new york and new jersey is somehow linked 
to the october stock market crash duncan said

american telephone amp telegraph co confirmed 
wednesday it is reevaluating aspects of its relationship with ing 
c olivetti amp co spa the italian partner that builds its personal 
computer line 
atampt chairman robert e allen said tuesday in madrid that the 
company may curtail purchases of olivetti personal computers and 
may seek another supplier 
allen speaking at a news luncheon also said the company plans 
to take direct management control of its foreign operations 
the remarks were reported wednesday by the wall street journal 
and confirmed by atampt 
but atampt spokeswoman marj mckean said atampt expects to 
strengthen not weaken its ties with olivetti both sides are 
looking at the arrangement with a hard business eye but a 
reassessment does not automatically mean a change she added 
olivetti currently sells atampt minicomputers and phone switches 
in europe ms mckean said she could not confirm whether allens 
mention about taking direct management control referred to the 
olivetti relationship 
allen said the olivetti review was prompted in part by changes 
in currencyexchange rates and the two companies product 
portfolios according to the journal 
atampt owns 223 percent of olivettis stock there were reports 
of discord between the companies earlier this year after they 
reportedly could not agree on terms for atampt to boost its stake in 
the italian company 
vittorio cassoni hired away from olivetti to head atampts 
computer operations recently returned to olivetti as managing 
director robert m kavner the new head of atampts data systems 
group was elected last week as an olivetti director 
ms mckean said cassonis return to olivetti could help the 
relationship cassoni has a clear vision of what were doing here 
and he understands our needs and he takes that with him to 
olivetti she said

the bottom and fear of high interest rates on the top observed 
robert h stovall president of the stovalltwentyfirst advisers 
inc securities firm 
high interest rates hurt wall street by cutting into the 
corporate profits that support stock prices and by causing 
investors to take money from stocks and put it into highyielding 
debt instruments 
one exception wednesday was the strength that developed in

swiss chocolate maker jacobs suchard sa on 
wednesday offered 21 billion pounds or 39 billion for rowntree 
plc if the british confectioner agrees to a friendly merger 
but suchard which just received british government approval to 
purchase up to 299 percent of rowntree said it would launch a 
hostile bid if its amicable approach failed 
the announcement came immediately after the british government 
also cleared a competing hostile offer from swiss foods giant 
nestle sa 
the approvals came in the form of a decision by trade secretary 
lord young not to refer nestles bid and suchards stake to the 
monopolies and mergers commission 
rowntree chairman kenneth dixon said he was disappointed that 
the government failed to call for an investigation into nestles 
bid because of the important public issues to be considered 
dixon said rowntree remains firmly opposed to nestles bid 
which he said fails to reflect the true value of the company 
rowntree makes the internationally popular kit kat candy bars and 
after eight chocolates among other products 
rowntree did not comment on whether it would meet with suchard 
nestle which holds about 16 percent of rowntrees 224 million 
outstanding shares said it was pleased the government will allow 
it to pursue its 1664ashare bid while that bid values rowntree 
at about 37 billion nestle has said it would cost 39 billion 
to complete the acquisition 
suchard vice president walter anderau said his company was 
seeking a fundamentally different form of cooperation with 
rowntree if that doesnt succeed then well make a full bid 
suchard a zurichbased company with interests in chocolate and 
coffee said it is seeking a recommendation from the rowntree board 
of directors for a possible cash offer 1758 a share or for other 
means of joining the two companies confectionery businesses 
lord young said a full bid from suchard would need government 
clearance 
the swiss companies bids for rowntree dubbed the candy bar 
wars have sparked controversy in britain over whether rowntree 
should remain in british hands the takeover target and members of 
parliament pressured the conservative government to refer the bid 
to the monopolies commission 
but lord young said wednesday that in deciding whether to refer 
a bid we look mainly at the effect on competition in the united 
kingdom these proposals raise no competition issues 
he noted that nestle and suchard currently control 3 percent and 
2 percent respectively of the british chocolate market 
critics claim it is unfair for swiss companies which are 
protected from takeovers by foreign firms to bid for british 
companies that do not operate under the same protection 
opposition lawmaker doug henderson noted that people are now 
very worried he said it seems rowntree is among the first 
casualties in the battle for 1992 
the common market intends to abolish all internal trade barriers 
to create a single european market of 320 million consumers by 1992 
earlier this month the government cleared usbased general 
cinema corps acquisition of a 177 percent stake in cadbury 
schweppes plc 
general cinema which has announced that it doesnt any longer 
consider its stake in cadbury to be a passive investment said 
wednesday it increased its stake to 184 percent

precious metals futures prices fell broadly wednesday on 
profittaking as fears of inflation eased and the dollar gained 
strength against other currencies 
on other markets soybean futures plummeted and prices retreated 
for an array of commodities including grains cotton livestock 
and meat oils and stockindex futures 
prices for future delivery of platinum which has led the 
preciousmetals complex in posting impressive gains this month 
dropped 1120 per troy ounce across the board on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
the platinum contract for delivery in july settled at 57940 a 
troy ounce july platinum rose from 515 a troy ounce at the 
beginning of this month to a high of 59750 at one point during 
tuesdays session 
analysts said the dollars gains declining commodity prices and 
nervousness about thursdays government report on the gross 
national product all contributed to the fall in precious metals 
prices 
mainly theres some uncertainty as to what the gnp number is 
going to be said andrea gould director of investments for the 
platinum guild international in new york whenever there is 
uncertainty and there are profits to be taken theyll take their 
profits 
the commodity research bureaus index of 21 commodities a rough 
indicator of inflation fell sharply wednesday which spurred 
further selling of precious metals futures analysts said 
nevertheless many technical and fundamental factors suggest 
platinum gold and silver will continue to rally analysts said 
i would categorize this as a normal correction following a 
meteoric advance in platinum since the beginning of the month 
said bernard savakl an analyst in new york with painewebber inc 
nothing goes straight up like a rocket 
savakl noted that warehouse stocks of gold at the commodity 
exchange in new york fell about 185000 troy ounces wednesday to a 
10year low of about 1224 million ounces the physical tightness 
is supportive for the gold market and could be a prelude to an 
explosive upside move this summer he said

with june at 45480 a troy ounce silver was 162 cents to 182 
cents lower with may at 6592 a troy ounce

their forecasts for early next week 
technical factors also entered into the fray analysts said 
attitudes turned bearish after an effort to push the price for 
november delivery of soybeans beyond 808 a bushel the contracts 
lifetime high stalled at 807 
a sharp drop in cash prices for argentine soybean meal also 
weighed on the soybean complex said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
but overpowering everything else is the weather he said 
after the close the national weather service issued a 
sixto10day forecast calling for normal to abovenormal rainfall 
in the midwest during the second half of next week 
wheat settled 4 cents to 8 cents lower with july at 341 a

cotton futures which are also weathersensitive posted steep 
losses on the new york cotton exchange the july contract settled 
110 cents lower at 6507 cents a pound 
livestock and meat futures retreated on the chicago mercantile 
exchange on expectations of a temporary slowdown in wholesale meat 
demand

holiday weekend is pretty much done said tom ohare an analyst 
in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
live cattle settled 25 cent to 65 cent lower with june at 
7170 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 75 cent lower

american airlines announced wednesday it 
would buy up to 100 boeing 757200s to replace aging aircraft in 
its fleet giving the seattle aerospace company its second 
multibilliondollar order in as many weeks 
american officials said they were ordering 50 757s for delivery 
between july 1989 and november 1991 with an option to purchase 50 
more the deal could be worth more than 4 billion to boeing 
boeing commercial airplanes president dean thornton said the 
order substantiates boeings belief in a plane that had been a slow 
seller since its launch a decade ago 
i think most of you know that weve been probably a little 
disappointed with the 757 over the years thornton said 
the purchase and thereby the endorsement of the product by an 
airline like american is going to be a real boost to boeing and a 
real boost to what we think is going to be a mainstay in the 
domestic and international markets he said 
american executives said exact cost figures were proprietary 
but robert w baker americans vice president for operations said 
the order was on very favorable terms for american with the 
first 50 jets costing just over 2 billion and the second 50 about 
the same 
analyst wolfgang demisch at union bank of switzerland in new 
york said american got a very good deal at a price of roughly 
40 million a plane depending on configuration 757s normally sell 
for 41 million to 47 million each 
industry analysts say boeing could be headed for its fourth 
straight year of record orders topping 1987s 202 billion 
boeing has had orders for 326 aircraft so far this year compared 
with 366 ordered for all of 1987 
wednesdays announcement follows a may 16 firm order by 
international lease finance corp of beverly hills calif for 100 
boeing aircraft with options for 24 more at 46 billion for the 
124 planes the ilfc deal was a record for boeing 
several newspapers have reported that allegis corp parent of 
united airlines is considering ordering up to 60 757s worth an 
estimated 25 billion to 29 billion possibly this week both 
allegis and boeing officials have declined to comment on the 
reports 
american canceled an order to buy 15 757s in 1982 because of 
poor economic conditions and thornton said boeing has been talking 
with american about buying the new jet since 
baker said americans new jets will primarily replace aging 
boeing 737s and 727s in its fleet the 194passenger 757 jetliner 
with a range of about 3300 miles burns 25 percent less fuel than 
comparable aircraft and will be powered by two rolls royce engines 
the 50 additional planes if ordered would be delivered through 
december 1993 in an interview with the seattle times last week 
american chairman robert crandall said it was possible american 
could order yet another 100 757s by the end of the century 
boeing introduced the 757 in 1978 as a hightech fuelstingy 
replacement for its 727 trijet which went into service in 1964 
but a drop in fuel prices and airline deregulation stalled sales 
just 239 of the jets were ordered through the end of 1987 
so far this year however 90 757s have been ordered analysts 
say higher maintenance costs for older planes tougher airport 
noise restrictions and airport congestion have brought the plane 
new popularity 
it was just a matter of time before the 757 would grow into 
its time analyst david smith of robert elsworth and co in 
washington dc said tuesday 
thornton said boeing planned to increase 757 production at its 
renton plant from four a month at present to five a month sometime 
next year however he said boeing did not expect to need to hire 
many new workers 
crandall said american chose rollsroyce engines for the 757 
because of what he called its superior reliability over comparable 
pratt amp whitney models available he said pratt amp whitney undertook 
a vigorous competition to gain the order but rolls simply 
prevailed

dayton hudson corp shareholders on wednesday 
accepted an antitakeover defense suggested by management and 
rejected a stockholders request to dismantle another antitakeover 
provision

elected each year to threeyear terms instead of all directors 
standing for reelection every year the company announced

hudsons poison pill plan to a shareholder vote directors 
adopted the poison pill which allows more stock to be issued 
during a hostile takeover in september 1986

and defended the poison pill as a useful bargaining tool in 
takeover situations 
dayton hudson was the target of a 662 billion takeover attempt

profits two years in a row and earnings were down in the first 
quarter of 1988
