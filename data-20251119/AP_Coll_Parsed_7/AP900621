the us navy sought thursday to assure 
the public that the aircraft carrier midway was safe after two 
explosions on board killed two crew members and seriously injured 
nine 
the safety of the ship was never in jeopardy rear adm lyle 
bull commander of the battle force 7th fleet told reporters 
escorted aboard the ship a day after the fire 
japan the only country to experience nuclear attack asked the 
us military to improve its safety practices yokosuka officials 
had demanded assurances of the 45yearold carriers safety before 
its return 
demonstrators charged the ship was carrying nuclear weapons into 
its home port at yokosuka despite a japanese ban the united states 
refuses to comment on the location of its nuclear weapons 
about 50 protesters chanting dont let the midway land here 
and nuclear ship get out assembled outside the navy base gate 
about an hour before the 67000ton ship moored at yokosuka 28 
miles southwest of tokyo 
eight of the demonstrators wore sashes identifying them as 
victims of the us atomic bombings of the japanese cities of 
hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 
navy officials allowed relatives of the crew onto the ship 
before reporters were taken aboard 
midway is safe and seaworthy in all respects bull said 
stressing that there was no danger to the ships weapons systems 
from the explosions 
bull said the first explosion occurred shortly after noon 
wednesday when a firefighting crew investigating smoke opened the 
hatch to a 12by12foot emergency equipment storeroom six decks 
below the flight deck 
death most probably was instantaneous for the two sailors 
killed in the blast he said in addition to the nine seriously 
injured who were flown to hospitals ashore seven other injured 
crewmen were treated on the ship 
the second explosion came 45 minutes later bull said earlier 
navy officials said there was a fire in the room bull said there 
were explosions burn injuries smoke and intense heat but not 
necessarily a fire 
the room was near a pipe for the ships catapult system 
containing pressurized steam at 850 degrees and water sprayed on 
the bulkhead turned to steam thats how hot it was he said 
one unidentified crew member interviewed on japanese television 
said a fuel pipe near the steam line cracked and leaked fuel which 
then ignited navy officials said they could not comment until an 
investigation is complete 
capt arthur k cebrowski said about 1000 sailors worked 
through the night to secure the area and flood it with water and 
foam and provide support the bodies were found early thursday he 
said 
in washington the pentagon identified the two dead sailors as 
ulric patrick johnson of martinez calif and jeffrey allan vierra 
of nevada city calif 
the midway carries a crew of 4500 and 62 aircraft the 
1000foot carrier was commissioned in 1945 and is the navys 
oldest in active service although it has been extensively 
modernized 
the explosions occurred as the ship participated in a joint 
exercise 125 miles northeast of yokosuka with the japanese maritime 
self defense force navy officials said the exercise would continue 
without the midway 
in japan many people have misgivings about the presence of 
50000 us troops and us armaments here 
the midway fire was the second serious navy accident since a 
series of incidents last fall killed 14 people

luther campbell beleaguered leader of the 
controversial rap group 2 live crew has come under attack from two 
new sources a former lover suing for child support and the naacps 
top official 
the miami groups most popular album as nasty as they wanna 
be has been ruled obscene by a federal judge campbell and two 
other group members were arrested june 10 in hollywood fla on 
charges of giving an obscene performance 
the obscenity ruling is being appealed and the rappers are 
awaiting a court date on the misdemeanor charge 
on thursday daycare teacher davania branch went public over a 
lawsuit she filed seeking support for the child she claims was 
fathered two years ago by campbell 29 
and dr benjamin l hooks executive director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people criticized the 
raw nature of some of 2 live crews lyrics 
hooks said in a statement wednesday that the naacp found itself 
in the position of defending their right to freedom of 
expression while at the same time condemning the vicious sadistic 
and demeaning nature of some of their material 
we are particularly offended by their efforts to wrap the 
mantle of the black cultural experience around their performances 
by saying this is the way it is in the black community he said 
our cultural experience does not include debasing our women 
the glorification of violence the promotion of deviant sexual 
behavior or the tearing into shreds of our cherished mores of 
standards of behavior 
but hooks said the naacp believed as campbell maintains that 
many of the attacks on the group contain some elements of 
racism otherwise he said white perfomers who use profane sexy 
lyrics would also be condemned 
telephone calls seeking comment from campbell on thursday were 
not returned 
the miami paternity lawsuit was filed in march when ms branch 
accused campbell of providing only sporadic and limited financial 
support since the birth of 2yearold lutheria renea branch 
ive had a lot of serious problems she told reporters 
thursday i have been struggling and he knows this 
she said she was trying to provide the child with the best of 
things that she needs 
when youre dealing with an infant the milk is not cheap 
she said 
in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit campbell said he was not ms 
branchs exclusive lover during their relationship

nelson mandela 
name nelson rolihlahla mandela 
age 71 
born july 18 1918 in transkei the son of a xhosa tribal 
chief 
title deputy president of the african national congress

current political objective mandela says dialogue between the 
south african government and the anc is the only way to a peaceful 
future he wants the government to free all prisoners convicted of 
politically motivated crimes stop police from firing on black 
protesters and end the state of emergency in the natal province 
where anc supporters are battling members of the rival inkatha 
organization 
when those conditions are met he says the anc and the 
government can enter into negotiations apparently including other 
political organizations to develop a new nonracial democratic 
constitution based on a oneperson onevote system 
current tour mandela is on a sixweek tour of africa europe 
and north america to thank the world for pressuring the south 
african government to remove the ban on the anc and free him and 
his colleagues

norma chavarria a former teacher has 
opened a makeshift store to keep going until president violeta 
barrios de chamorro makes the stalled economy run and times get 
better 
we have to give violeta time she said how can a 
president do in 40 days what the sandinistas couldnt do in 10 
years my husband and i are confident things will get better in 
about six months 
mrs chavarria 24 leaned on the counter in the dirtfloored 
wooden shack where she sells single cakes of laundry soap soft 
drinks envelopes of soup mix and other inexpensive items 
a neighbor who had just come in said thats right those 
sandinistas didnt do anything except make us go to meetings a 
meeting for this a meeting for that we have to give a little time 
to poor dona violeta 
mrs chavarrias husband jose is a bricklayer who brings home 
20 a month slightly more than she earned as a grade school 
teacher her teaching papers were lost they moved here recently 
from esteli so they decided she should open the store 
many people seem to share the guarded optimism of mrs chavarria 
and the neighbor but there also is a show me attitude that 
good times are not just around the corner 
nicaraguans voted the sandinistas out feb 25 and inflation 
still is high nearly two months after mrs chamorros proamerican 
government was inaugurated 
inflation reached 36000 percent in 1988 then declined to 1800 
percent in 1989 
francisco mayorga president of the central bank now gauges it 
weekly his figures were 47 percent for the first week of may then 
17 percent 12 and 11 for the next three 
mayorga who was educated at yale and devised mrs chamorros 
economic recovery plan accused the sandinistas of using the 
twomonth transition period to undermine the new government 
he said they spent money wildly and printed more to cover the 
deficit 
president bush signed a 300 million aid package may 26 the 
first 60 million arrived quickly and between may 25 and may 31 
the black market price of a dollar declined from 310000 cordobas 
to 290000 
the exchange houses are supplying dollars again thats why it 
went down said jose gutierrez one of two dozen currency dealers 
on a street near the mexican embassy 
gutierrez and his colleagues wave wads of cordobas at passing 
motorists and police look the other way 
another sign of improvement is a 20 percent increase in planted 
farm acreage over last year mayorga said food production fell 
steadily under the sandinistas 
on the negative side nicaraguas currency has been devalued 
frequently since mrs chamorro took office the parallel exchange 
rate which governs most dollar transactions had gone from 70800 
cordobas to 226600 by may 31 
some chamorro supporters are beginning to grumble 
maybe we would have been better off under the sandinistas 
said julio gonzalez 33 who runs an auto repair shop with his 
cousin former president daniel ortega he said had the economy 
more or less under control 
what does he expect to happen now maybe well see an 
improvement in six months a year but it better happen just like 
we knocked down somoza we knocked down the sandinistas well we 
can knock down this government too 
the sandinista revolution overthrew the late president anastasio 
somosa in july 1979 
rolando perez sanchez a 29yearold sandinista union leader 
listened with skepticism to gonzalez his friend and neighbor 
its not going to happen he said shaking his head this 
government if full of bourgeois who will hoard all the capital and 
leave the workers the crumbs 
what we have to do is what daniel said rule from below to 
defend the conquests of the revolution 
ruling from below took the form of a crippling strike by 
public employees in may aftr which the government gave broad 
concessions to unions 
mrs chamorro has had to proceed carefully because of the 
militant sandinista opposition 
her government plans to review confiscations of property under 
the sandinistas and continues to trim the huge bureaucracy firing 
public employees 
sandinista threats of more strikes if the firings continued have 
not materialized and their protest marches draw smaller crowds if 
economic improvement continues the sandinistas could lose the 
leverage of being the defenders of workers buying power 
another sandinista rallying point the contra rebels might 
disappear once the guerrillas demobilize 
im like st thomas ill have to see it to believe it 
gonzalez said 
for mrs chavarria who has three small children abolition of 
the twoyear draft for boys of 16 is great progress 
you dont know what a relief this is for us mothers she 
said as for the rest of it well have to wait at least we eat 
every day

scientific research is about to blow the lid 
off the mystery behind a common household horror why thick soups 
and stews explode and splatter the inside of microwave ovens 
its a consumer problem the housewife or kid comes back and 
heres lunch all over the inside of the microwave said david w 
cable a mechanical engineer at metricor inc in woodinville wash 
metricor a subsidiary of corning inc sells 12000 fiberoptic 
sensors that are being used by rutgers university scientists to 
measure temperatures and pressures of food as it is cooked in 
microwave ovens 
he said the researchers want to know why some microwaved foods 
splatter as they cook and how to prevent the messy problem 
cable who is metricors marketing and sales manager presented 
preliminary results of the study wednesday during the annual 
meeting of the institute of food technologists which drew more 
than 15000 food scientists to the anaheim convention center 
what causes cream of mushroom soup to attack the walls of a 
microwave oven while chicken bouillon remains cautiously in its 
bowl the institute asked in a news release scientists are 
coming close to an answer for that question 
cable said a food being cooked in a microwave oven is injected 
with microwave energy at a rate similar to lightning striking a 
tree the phenomenon is the same except for its magnitude 
as water and sap in a tree flash to steam the tree 
literally explodes this is what happens in the microwave to 
foods that are trapping the steam 
food scientists call the splattering phenomenon popping or 
bumping cable said 
some people have developed a sort of richter scale of these 
explosions he said 
cable and the institute said that so far the foodindustry 
sponsored study has provided the following solutions some of which 
may seem obvious 
foods should be centered in the microwave because heat is more 
evenly distributed there the edges contain hot spots that are more 
likely to make water in thick soups flash into exploding steam 
bubbles 
thicker soups are much more likely to splatter than thinner 
liquids because heat concentrates more easily in a viscous liquid 
allowing steam bubbles to expand until they are large and create a 
messy explosion 
cable suggested cooking thick soups or stews at lower power 
stirring them before putting them in the microwave oven and 
covering the cooking container with a paper towel to contain the 
splattering 
if a cooking container contains ridges or some other rough 
surface bubbles can form more easily and in greater numbers and 
lots of small bubbles distribute heat more evenly while a few 
large bubbles are more likely to send the soup flying 
the rutgers study may result in improvements in packaging for 
microwaveable foods allowing them to be cooked with less mess 
cable said 
cable acknowledged the research may seem silly but said 
consumers dont expect this nice clean package you put in your 
microwave to come apart and throw food all over the inside 
its a cleanup issue and were all tidy americans we dont 
like to be untidy

than 800000 people 
the african national congress leader responded with a plea for 
continued economic sanctions against his homeland a theme he has 
sounded throughout his worldwide tour 
we appeal to you in all humility and in all sincerity that you 
must join us in the internal actions that you are taking to force 
the government to abandon apartheid mandela said shortly after 
landing at kennedy international airport 
there and at city hall mandela thanked americans for their 
support of the antiapartheid movement after receiving the key to 
the city he declared apartheid is doomed south africa shall be 
free the struggle continues 
he told the city hall crowd that he envisions a new south 
africa one which banishes forever racism in all its forms and 
becomes a truly nonracial nonsexist society 
in huntsville ala president bush reiterated that the united 
states would not lift economic sanctions against south africa until 
that country meets the requirements of the sanctions law those 
requirements include the release of all political prisoners in 
south africa 
mandela is to meet with bush during a later stop in washington 
police estimated that 350000 people lined streets along 
mandelas route from the airport and another 450000 turned out 
for the tickertape parade up broadways canyon of heroes 
the anc leader was in a specially designed mandelamobile a 
flatbed truck outfitted with a bulletproof glass shed 
the crowd cheered wildly as mandela passed by many wore mandela 
buttons and waved posters with his picture 
i just feel proud said denise brutus an american airlines 
employee im so happy i couldnt stay home and watch it i had 
to be in his presence 
the avenue was ankledeep in ticker tape and other paper trees 
and traffic lights throughout the area were dripping with streams 
of computer paper 
judith bateman a senior citizens program director from 
irvington nj showed up early to insure a first row seat 
i pray for him every night said bateman who was outfitted 
in a red tshirt with a map of africa and wore a mandela button

of city police and federal and state agents part of a security 
detail dubbed operation topaz 
mandela was greeted at the airport by dignitaries including gov 
mario cuomo who said mandelas visit was not a victory lap but a 
long distance journey to remind us that until south africa is 
completely free the march toward freedom has not reached its final 
destination 
mayor david dinkins the citys first black mayor gave the man 
he has called his hero a giant bear hug upon meeting him and 
promised 
one day in this lifetime we will reach freedoms gate together 
and pass through to a land where we all will be judged by our 
fellow beings for the content of our character rather than the 
color of our skin 
despite a twohour arrival delay mandela insisted on stopping 
at a brooklyn high school where thousands of students and residents 
from the predominantly black bedfordstuyvesant neighborhood 
greeted him with cheers of mandela and keep the pressure 
on 
i sincerely feel very strong and encouraged because if in our 
struggle we receive the support of the youth of the world then our 
cause can never fail can never be lost mandela told the crowd 
he then ate lunch at the coast guard station in battery park 
overlooking the statue of liberty after lunch he and his wife 
winnie stepped outside to look at the statue before leaving for 
the parade 
the mandelas arrived from canada nearly two hours late after

spokesman tom kelly 
mandela was released from prison four months ago after serving 
27 years for his activities on behalf of south africas black 
majority during that time his name became a rallying cry around 
the world for black equality 
after his release he resumed his active role in the anc and is 
presently seeking money and political support for the movement 
mandela waved to the cheering crowd as he stepped off the plane 
and raised a clenched fist as the boys choir of harlem sang the anc

a report today that a controversial drug appears 
to slow the onset of aids has met with skepticism from doctors with 
the food and drug administration 
the study conducted in scandinavia found that isoprinosine 
resulted in an eightfold reduction in the progression to aids in 
infected people who took the medicine for six months 
fda doctors noted that earlier studies showed no benefit from 
the treatment 
azt is the only drug approved to slow the onset of aids in 
people infected with the aids virus it works by attacking the 
virus directly interfering with its reproduction inside the body 
while no one knows precisely how isoprinosine works doctors 
speculated it boosts the power of white blood cells that fight 
infection 
in the latest report dr court pedersen of the university of 
copenhagen and other doctors from denmark and sweden reported on 
use of the medicine in 866 patients they reported their findings 
in the new england journal of medicine 
we conclude that treatment with inosine pranobex 
isoprinosine delays progression to aids in patients with hiv 
infection they wrote hiv is the human immunodeficiency virus 
which causes aids 
the study was conducted on men and women who were infected with 
the virus but had no symptoms of aids a total of 429 took 
isoprinosine while 437 got dummy pills 
during the treatment period two patients on isoprinosine 
developed aids compared with 17 people in the comparison group 
however levels of helper t cells the white blood cells that are 
the primary target of the aids virus fell identically in both 
groups 
in an accompanying editorial dr sandra l kweder and two other 
fda physicians expressed skepticism 
because of conflicting results of other studies and the lack of 
understanding of how the drug might work more study is needed 
before isoprinosine can be considered effective by doctors and the 
fda they wrote 
in 1986 the fda accused newport pharmaceuticals international 
which manufactures the drug of making misleading claims about its 
usefulness against aids two years later the company announced the 
drug had proved ineffective in clinical testing

getting infected with the aids virus is a major 
hazard for doctors and nurses who work in operating rooms in places 
where aids is common researchers reported today 
their study estimates that at san francisco general hospital 
where the research was conducted there is likely to be one aids 
infection every eight years among operating room personnel because 
of onthe job exposure 
but in most cities where aids is far less common the risk is 
closer to one infection every 80 years the study said 
some surgeons and other doctors have urged testing of patients 
for aids infection before surgery so they will be extra careful 
when operating on them 
however the latest study concludes that this is unlikely to 
help 
it found that even if doctors highly suspected that their 
patients were infected they were just as likely to be exposed to 
their blood 
the study was directed by dr julie gerberding and published in 
todays new england journal of medicine 
aids infection represents a major lifethreatening 
occupational hazard for surgical personnel practicing at san 
francisco general hospital and similar locales with a high 
prevalence of hiv the researchers wrote hiv or human 
immunodeficiency virus causes aids 
the study was based on a review of 1307 consecutive surgical 
procedures performed over two months in 1988 
in 22 cases doctors and nurses suffered cuts and other mishaps 
that could have brought the aids virus into their bodies these 
included needle jabs cuts with surgical instruments and blood 
splashed into the eyes 
in 95 other cases they had patients blood on their skin 
mostly through tears in gloves splashes in the face or 
bloodsoaked gowns 
chances are slight that a single exposure even a needle jab 
will result in infection although several such cases have been 
documented scientists say 
based on their data the doctors wrote we calculated a 
theoretical risk of hiv infection in surgical personnel at san 
francisco general hospital of 0125 infections per year or one 
infection every eight years

concern for nelson mandelas health prompted 
cuts in his schedule wednesday even before he left canada to begin 
a busy visit in the united states 
were heeding the winds of caution sylvia hill a tour 
organizer said in announcing that mandela a month short of 72 
years old and less than three weeks out of the hospital needed 
rest and would arrive late 
we feel after careful review particularly based on the prior 
schedule in canada we must scale back his program she said 
we were told this morning that mr mandela himself felt the 
schedule was too heavy and he asked for the changes said 
cecelia mccall a tour committee spokeswoman 
lindiwe mabuza the african national congress representative in 
the united states said that after talking with the mandela party 
in canada early wednesday i didnt get the impression he was 
sick i got the impression he needed rest 
mandelas arrival nearly two hours behind schedule cut some of 
his rest time between speaking at a brooklyn high school and his 
tickertape parade on broadway the last event of the day 
afterdinner meetings with south african exiles was dropped so he 
could turn in early 
a breakfast thursday with the rev jesse jackson was also 
scrapped instead he was to meet with jackson shortly before a 
meeting later in the morning with religious leaders said mayoral 
spokesman tom kelly 
since he left a hospital bed on june 3 mandela has described 
his health as good but organizers of the american leg of mandelas 
13nation tour said from the start that he may be overbooked and 
that protecting his health would come first 
coordinator roger wilkins labeled the the us schedule of 34 
major events in eight cities in 12 days as tentative and asserted 
that mandela was a precious 71yearold human being rather than 
an ambulatory prize to help americans feel good about themselves 
mandela had a cyst removed from his bladder in johannesburg 
south africa during the last week of may he was sent off with a 
supply of vitamins and antibiotics for the trip 
his doctor described him then as being medically like a man of 
50

in the gritty decaying 
factories of this town along the elbe river the talk is of job 
dismissal notices threatening hundreds of workers 
tangermuende is one of scores of towns and cities throughout 
east germany where freemarket spirit will soon lead to the 
shutdown of communistbuilt plants 
despite hopes for a brighter tomorrow the dirtcovered work 
places of today are looking better and better 
you can imagine what would have happened if henry ford had 
pulled out of detroit said engineer guenter netzband the 
whole city would have died 
the wood products and chipboard factory where netzband works is 
faced with a 50 percent drop in demand for its products in large 
part because east germany has been flooded with west german 
products 
the first job dismissal notices already have gone out this is 
something we never faced in 40 years said the 64yearold 
netzband it is expected that at least 800 of the 1200 workers 
will be unemployed by the autumn 
nationwide the number of unemployed is expected to swell a 
staggering 25 percent of the work force of 8 million as clothing 
textile and machinery factories collapse 
burdened with debt and bad management east germanys factories 
will face enormous pressures once the west german mark becomes the 
currency for both countries july 2 unemployment benefits will 
climb from the current 63 percent of ones salary to 75 percent 
but the jobless will still find themselves short of money when 
prices rise across the board 
the creditreform economics information center of west germany 
predicts that more than half of east germanys 8000 businesses 
will fold the rest will be saved in part during the shift from 
state ownership to fledgling private ownership 
some people have predicted a hot autumn of unrest after 
workers come back from summer vacations to face life without a job 
in tangermuende a nearly 1000yearold town along one of 
central europes major waterways the situation will be especially 
acute in the coming months four factories in this town employ 
about 2000 people and only several hundred have more or less 
certain jobs the rest may soon find themselves out of work 
the mood here is lousy said 22yearold mario engel 
outside the dilapidated veb ogema factory im just waiting for 
my layoff notice 
the ogema factory which makes syrups for soda and jams has 
tried to attract west german companies but the dickensian sight of 
rotting pipes broken windows and heaps of rubble has scared away 
potential partners 
sure people are all worked up said 53yearold ogema porter 
elfriede piotrovski who started working at the factory as a 
teenager everything is up in the air we just dont know whats 
going on 
beyond the threatened factory jobs hundreds of others nearby 
may soon be unemployed including the 500 forestry workers who 
supply the wood products plant with timber 
the end is looming for a small city said the east german 
labor union newspaper tribuene in a front page report about 
tangermuende 
where the town will head remains to be seen as is the case for 
hundreds of other east german communities retraining courses are 
sprouting up computer training appears to be a favorite 
engineers dont have to become boilermen or ironworkers is 
the motto at one training center in nearby magdeburg 
tangermuende economics director joachim roexe would like to see 
development of tourism in tangermuende where a handful of restored 
homes shows how beautiful the town could be if the historic center 
were restored 
west german tourists when they see tangermuende for the first 
time compare it with rothenburg ob der tauber roexe said 
proudly referring to the carefully restored west german medieval 
village that attracts millions of visitors each year 
roexe is also hoping for a partial rescue by west german firms 
although he acknowledges that so far no contracts have been signed 
new businesses are also being sought 
one thing is clear the citys industry is woefully behind 
western standards 
there was plenty of idle time in the factories but the 
employees werent at fault said roexe there were 
technological and organizational problems 
often there wasnt any material or there was idle time 
because the macines broke down he added 
he criticized local managers for insisting on keeping all jobs 
as they negotiated with potential west german investors 
they tried to save all of the jobs but wound up jeopardizing 
all of them he said 
roexe said there are some comparable west german wood factories 
that can produce more products at a lower price than those coming 
from the tangermuende plant and with onethird the work force 
the former communist mayor of tangermuende roexe was thrown out 
of office after the democratically elected government took over 
for roexe the local economic troubles are hitting home 
his wife evamaria is likely to lose her job at the chipboard 
factory while his 20yearold daughter works at a nearby nuclear 
plant under construction the plant may be abandoned because of 
massive safety problems

here is the text of president bushs 
news conference wednesday at the marshall space flight center 
bush are we ready 
well based on the recommendation of the secretary of state i 
have decided to suspend the dialogue between the united states and 
the plo pending a satisfactory response from the plo of steps it is 
taking to resolve problems associated with the recent acts of 
terrorism in particular that may 30th terrorist attack on israel 
by the palestinian liberation front a constituent group of the plo 
by way of background on december 14th 1988 yassir arafat 
speaking on behalf of the plo executive committee recognized 
israels right to exist he accepted the united nations security 
council resolutions 242 and 338 and he renounced terrorism 
now subsequently the united states announced that because the 
plo had met our longstanding conditions for dialogue we would begin 
a substantive dialogue with the plo 
and at the time we applauded chairman arafat for taking these 
essential steps and we have conducted such a dialogue with the plo 
through our embassy in tunis 
over the past 18 months representatives of the united states and 
the plo regularly exchanged views about the political and security 
situation in the region on balance we believe that these 
exchanges contributed to progress in the peace process 
on may 30th 1990 the palestinian liberation front attempted a 
seaborne terrorist infiltration into israel palestinian liberation 
front leader abu abbas represents the plo on the executive 
committee of the plo the size of the force and the geographical 
target area strongly indicate that civilians would have been the 
target 
that day we issued a statement deploring this attempted 
terrorist attack 
on may 31st we raised this incident with the plo in tunis we 
told them that it could not avoid responsibility for an attempted 
terrorist action by one of its constituent groups and needed to 
take steps to deal with the matter by condemning the operation 
disassociating itself from it and by also beginning to take steps 
to discipline abu abbas the perpetrator 
weve given the plo ample time to deal with this issue to date 
the plo has not provided a credible accounting of this incident or 
undertaken the actions outlined above the us does take note of the 
fact that the plo has disassociated itself from this attack and 
issued a statement condemning attacks against civilians in 
principle but as we previously indicated this is not sufficient 
this alone is not sufficient 
the usplo dialogue has demonstrated that it can advance the 
arabisraeli peace process and at the same time the dialogue is 
based on the assumption that the plo is willing to abide by the 
conditions it accepted in december 1988 including renunciation of 
terror 
and any time that the plo is prepared to take the necessary 
steps we are prepared to promptly resume the dialogue in the 
meantime we would hope and expect that the peace process would 
proceed as intended and without delay we remain committed to the 
pursuit of a comprehensive settlement of the arabisraeli conflict 
and to a just and lasting peace 
and as we often stated it is our view that such a peace must be 
based on those two resolutions un resolution 242 and 338 and the 
principle implicit therein of territory for peace and provide for 
israels security and palestinian political rights 
we believe that palestinian participation is vital to any 
successful process and that there are real opportunities for 
palestinians in this process 
we strongly hope that israelis palestinians and the arab states 
will recognize these opportunities and take the necessary steps to 
create an environment in which a viable peace process can thrive 
we denounce violence in the area and call upon all parties to 
eschew violence and terror and opt instead for dialogue and 
negotiation we are prepared to continue working with the parties 
toward this end 
ill be glad to take a few questions

q mr president about your announcement 
q mr president 
bush yes john sorry norm 
q doesnt your announcement of today coupled with secretary 
bakers words that the israelis should call the white house when 
they are serious mean that the us position on the peace process 
in the middle east is dormant right now 
bush john its not moving forward right now and the offer 
still stands i have sent a letter to prime minister shamir i have 
very specifically asked questions that relate to seriousness about 
the peace process 
but i would like to see the peace process move forward nothing 
herein should indicate anything different because here we are 
simply taking inaudible shot at terrorism 
norm excuse me i forgot my protocol here 
q marlin seemed to have lit a fairly short political fuse with 
his comments on the sampl bailout in accusing the democrats of having 
had a big part in that mess 
are you ready to play that game this election year and blame the 
democrats for a problem that others have laid on years of 
permissive regulation by the reagan administration 
bush norm youre almost getting me into the fight by the way 
you ask the question but no im not going to chuckles no i 
want to get the savings and loan problem solved 
and marlin properly seeing a couple of shots across my bow 
from certain distinguished members of the united states senate 
decided not to acquiesce in those attacks without some response 
what he did was appropriate but what im trying to do is not 
respond to individuals and to simply keep moving forward on this 
on this process and not try to be out there saying heres whos to 
blame and heres whos not to blame 
but it was interesting because i think youre right a spark 
seemed to be ignited there and i think more important than 
continuing to pour fuel on that spark is to work cooperatively with 
the congress in trying to get this mess solved 
and of course that is a part of what will be discussed in the 
budget process 
i would say to the american people on this one the obligation 
is to protect the depositor thats what our obligation is 
and another obligation is to prosecute those who have broken the 
law and there has been an active prosecution under way i talked 
with dick thornburgh at lunch yesterday i got some impressive 
numbers of the numbers of cases that are that are being followed 
up on now and i expect well see plenty more 
so protect the depositor put those that are guilty into the 
dock where they belong and see that they are you know brought to 
responsibility for what theyve done 
q do you in retrospect though agree with the argument that 
deregulation or unregulation of the savings and loan the financial 
industry occurred too quickly went too far in the 80s 
bush well i think in looking back i think some of the 
excesses of the loan policies are rather obvious basically we 
made some proposals i think in that task force that i headed that 
might have corrected some of the abuse 
but i dont want to i dont want to argue in favor of 
reregulation of industries but i will say that i think some of 
the loan policies instituted after the changes were made were 
foolish and were certainly illadvised and the result is a 
pounding for the original purpose of the sampls which was financing 
primarily financing housing in this country 
yeah john 
q is it true that none of our allies with the exception of 
course of the israelis wanted you to suspend these talks with the 
plo and you said you have given the plo enough time i mean why 
now i mean is there some reason to toughen in today 
bush no i dont think of any reason today and i didnt set 
it you know in my mind x numbers of days but john i think 
there will be a lack of agreement with what ive done here on the 
part of our strongest allies 
and i know this is true on the part of some of the most 
reasonable and moderate arab states 
but i would simply remind them of the conditions upon which the 
dialogue started in the first place and i would also remind them 
that if they look at this statement and remedial action is taken 
the dialogue from the us side can promptly be restored

q mr president at the same time youre having this trouble 
with the plo youve also got a new israeli government that has an 
avowed policy of settling in the west bank more rapidly than its 
been settled in the past how are you going to deal with that 
government whats your policy going to be on aid for that 
government specifically on housing guarantees for soviet 
immigrants 
bush well jerry i think i probably my position on 
settlement in the territories is probably as well known as 
anything and our policy is not to have new settlements and our 
policy is certainly not to finance new settlements is that 
responsive or was there another part to your question 
q theres a specific question now though of whether well 
provide housing guarantees for soviet immigrants of 100 million 
bush well but not to settle in the in the post 67 
territory in the territories beyond the 67 lines 
q are you going to seek specific new guarantees from this new 
government that that wont happen 
bush well i will and i hope im successful but i think they 
they there is no question that the shamir government knows my 
position on this knows the standing position of the united states 
here and then jim 
q mr president as you know nelson mandela arrived in the 
united states today and youre going to meet with him next week 
what are you going to tell him on the sanctions question 
and second the second part there have been reports oh some 
weeks ago that the united states central intelligence agency was 
involved in a process that led to a rift many years ago and there 
have been suggestions that you should apologize on behalf of the 
united states government and the american people will you do that 
bush no i will take my leadership on that question from mr 
mandela who put it very well when he said let bygones be 
bygones and that is not to agree with or disagree with the 
charge 
on the second point your first my second the sanctions 
under the law cannot be lifted until certain additional steps are 
taken by south africa 
let me be very clear i salute mr de klerk for what hes done 
hes come a long long way and i salute mr mandela for his 
approach to de klerk i think that demonstrates a willingness to 
talk that few of us might have predicted a couple of years ago but 
there still are things that have to be done under our law in order 
to lift the sanctions 
and ive listed them here but anyway you dont want to go into 
the details on it but if you do id be glad to click them off for 
you 
but in any event there has to be progress and id like to find 
a way to show mr de klerk that we the united states are grateful 
for this new approach that is having south africa evolve to a much 
more open society and hopefully one day to one which is color blind 
in terms of participation in the political process 
but i cant lift the sanctions under existing us law but im 
looking forward to talking to mr mandela about this there are 
black leaders in south africa that disagree with him on this 
question of sanctions the foremost of those that come to mind is 
mr buthelezi but with whom i have talked about this question 
and i historically have not felt that certainly adding to the 
sanction base would help at all and i had some original 
reservations about a sanction approach but i will say that it 
seems to if you can credit sanctions with the evolution of 
towards democracy in south africa id have to say well it seems 
to be you know there are some good things to it 
but its delicate because i want to find a way to show our 
appreciation to de klerk and yet i dont want to pull the rug out 
from under mr mandela

weary from only a few hours sleep cecelie 
blakey began another long day at the telephone changing nelson 
mandelas tour schedule for the umpteenth time and frustrating a 
lot of folks who had counted on seeing him up close and personal 
they are not going to like this at all blakey associate 
coordinator of the mandela tour national welcome committee said as 
she dialed 
this day she was breaking the news that mandela had decided not 
to attend any event on his us tour before 9 am or after 9 pm 
that word came on the eve of mandelas wednesday arrival in new 
york effectively axing a lot of earlymorning and lateevening 
events already planned for the eightcity 12day tour 
youd be surprised how many breakfasts there are said 
blakey throwing up her hands 
when the news got to capitol hill the congressional black 
caucus was finalizing plans for an 8 am sitdown breakfast for 
350 next tuesday that was clearly out and alternatives were still 
up in the air early today 
the south african black nationalist leader is nearly 72 
recently had minor surgery and already has been on tour for several 
weeks 
blakey said the reactions to her schedule changes have run the 
gamut 
people can be quite crass she said theyll say weve 
collected x amount of dollars and if he wants the money then he 
must come to a private reception or whatever 
then there are people who just learned about mandela but are 
now insisting they have been at the forefront of the antiapartheid 
movement and deserve a photo opportunity with a signed picture 
she said 
blakey and other tour organizers said mandelas main message is 
to keep economic sanctions and other pressure for change on the 
white south african government 
with that mission blakey said mandela must speak at the united 
nations and congress reassure the new york financial community and 
meet with president bush the other activities are just extras she 
said 
people are very possessive about not only their cities but 
their neighborhoods blakey said of the hundreds of daily phone 
calls asking why not a trip to philadelphia houston the rural 
south why not swing by baltimore for a quick appearance at a 
convention 
hundreds of requests are rejected daily and were still 
turning them down 
the state department has received requests for credentials from 
more than 5500 media personnel 
mandela is a man who should be a president but isnt said 
blakey ticking off the privileges that are being denied like 
secret service and blair house accommodations 
the tour is being organized by private groups led by 
transafrica an antiapartheid lobbying group 
this is the first time africanamericans have had an 
opportunity to plan at this level she said because he happens 
to be a black leader and because africanamericans play such key 
roles it has been humbling to see the little power we have 
the clamor for tickets interviews photo opportunities and 
other contact with mandela by people willing to try everything 
imaginable to get on the tight schedule she said demonstrates 
our success in educating people about apartheid and making it a 
popular cause 
ive never seen anyone who is loved as much as this man and 
its not just blacks said lisa alfred legislative assistant 
with transafrica 
officials at fenton communications the public relations firm 
overseeing local events in washington without a fee said there are 
about five file folders crammed with requests for interviews and as 
many as 50 telephone calls are being fielded each hour 
its been incredibly hectic alfred said people are 
calling saying they named their baby nelson mandela and they want 
him to baptize the child some want him to come by their house for 
a barbecue or to eat potato salad 
alfred has been helping with ticket sales for a rally slated for 
next tuesday evening at the washington convention center officials 
expected to sell all the 20000 tickets for 10 and 25 by today 
controlling the rally tickets has been a major challenge for 
alfred because transafrica wants mandela to address a wide range of 
washington residents tickets for 12000 were distributed among 40 
groups including the elderly and labor unions 
the remaining tickets were sold daily only two hours a day for 
about a week 
people still call and beg for tickets said alfred some 
say they plan to just come to the center and stand outside during 
the rally

q mr president 
q mr president are you 
bush oh jim sorry well come back youre standing up i 
cant see you 
q mr president are you planning to support a g7 initiative 
to offer economic aid to the soviet union at next months economic 
summit and if so what has caused you to change your mind on that 
bush no im not planning to do that and i expect though 
that matter may be discussed there are ive tried to be very up 
front with mr gorbachev when he was here about difficulties in 
terms of financial support i talked to him in malta about that 
indeed we presented him with a list of things that might be 
done to improve our ability to work in full cooperation with them 
on that 
but i dont plan a new a new initiative and yet i want to 
see perestroika continue i havent changed my view that economic 
reform is important and i recognize that support from the west can 
well can well help the economy 
but there is an awful lot of reform that has to take place in 
the market and the distribution systems theres some political 
problems that we have that ive discussed very frankly with mr 
gorbachev not the least of them 5 billion a year going down to 
cuba 
so weve still got some problems there but discount the fact 
that we are planning some bold new initiative on the other hand 
im perfectly prepared to talk to our allies on any subject and i 
think that will probably be one of them 
q well there are reports that president mitterrand would 
propose such a plan is that 
bush well the germans are interested too and im not saying 
were not interested but i am saying there are some formidable 
obstacles 
yeah jim 
q back on the plo one of the theories passed around in your 
own administration was that the intent of this terrorist attack was 
to derail the peace process are you at all concerned that by 
suspending the dialogue youre playing into the hands of the 
hardliners like abu abbus and is there also a danger 
bush yes let me stop you there just to respond so i dont 
get forget the question yes i am concerned about that go ahead 
scattered laughter 
q well if youre so concerned about it then why did you why 
did you take this action 
bush well because we had to weigh the whole question and the 
question was complicated by the fact that there were three specific 
undertakings one of which a very important one in my view has 
clearly has been violated 
so but its not an easy call because i know some feel that 
the plo dialogue is totally unproductive and as i indicated in 
this statement i dont 
and the question up here was well do our allies will they 
agree with the steps that ive taken here in huntsville today and 
the answer is no some of them will not agree because they do 
feel that the dialogue has kind of helped calm things in some parts 
of the middle east 
so so what the answer to it is is for the plo to take the 
action that ive called for and to satisfactorily to satisfy us 
that those who were responsible will be disciplined and condemn 
this specific act its not enough to simply reiterate ones 
concern on terror 
q if i may follow up 
bush please 
q is there a danger too that those palestinians who would put 
some hope in the dialogue between the plo and the us might now 
throw up their hands in desperation and resort to violence 
bush well i hope thats not the case and yet i would refer 
you to the very last page of my last paragraph or two of the 
statement when i did call for no violence and i think its fair 
to say that at any time youre dealing with something as 
complicated as the middle east you worry about that 
but i hope thats not the case and i hope theyll see in my 
statement a rather temperate view here that though were specific 
in calling for the condemnation of this particular terrorist act 
that once that is done in keeping with the arafats arafats 
undertaking that we can resume talks 
there has been a frustration jim in the arab world that this 
dialogue has not resulted in more progress and i understand the 
frustration i dont happen to agree with it i think things are 
better because weve had the dialogue but israel has strongly 
objected to it and some palestinians have been as we can clearly 
see concerned about it but i believe that we ought to try to find 
a way to get it back at some point

q mr president 
q follow up sir what about the flip side of that coin if i 
might as you grappled with this did you worry and are you worried 
now that israel will just take this and say see weve been 
right about the plo all along and 
bush im not so troubled on that because i think they will see 
here that i am not accepting the premise that there is no good to 
come from talking to the plo so i dont worry too much about that 
point 
q but do you see mr shamir as too hard line as the kind of 
leader who is going to say well we were right and therefore 
well stay away from inaudible 
bush well i am hoping thats not the case and one of the 
reasons i sent him this long lengthy letter was to make clear to 
him that it is our view the peace process ought to go forward and 
its going to be difficult for him but it must go forward and it 
must go forward along the original the lines of what originally 
was the shamir plan and then it became mubarak got interested and 
he played a useful role in it then jim baker got involved and has 
done a heroic job in trying to get the talks going 
so we are we are i hope that the us will have a useful 
role to play regardless of the step i have taken here in the plo 
because as we all know we were not proposing that the plo be at 
the table this was a charge made against us by some of the some 
in israel and that isnt that doesnt happen to be the case and 
i think the government knows that 
yes rita excuse me i shouldnt have gotten you earlier 
q mr president during the campaign you said often that weve 
got to find a way that people who have children wont be threatened 
with the loss of their jobs and now youre saying that that has to 
be a voluntary provision on the part of employers to give parental 
leave how does that fulfill your campaign promise for people who 
work for employers who wont give voluntary leave 
bush youve got to keep working for them till they do because 
my campaign promise did not go to what they call mandated benefits 
and just to be sure i was right we looked it up again yesterday 
and but my position has not changed and i see that i must 
convince some republicans as well as many democrats that it hasnt 
changed 
q do you have any point of view on how you are going to 
convince these employers many of them say if its not a mandatory 
requirement why should they do it 
bush well i have a great great faith that collective 
bargaining and market forces move towards progress and weve seen 
it in the private sector and i want to see it faster and quicker 
in the private sector without burdening every business by the same 
formula of mandated benefits 
q mr president 
bush yes charles excuse me 
q you specified that the plo dialogue has been positive and 
productive but you havent really told us in what way could you 
be a little more specific about that what productivity do you see 
in it 
bush well i think the very fact we are talking can and 
thats one of the reasons i hope that it can be restored can 
eliminate differences and i would like to feel that the plo 
because of our dialogue doesnt see us as quite the hostile 
country that once they did 
and theres all kinds of small points that are taken up by our 
ambassador pelletreau in tunis that i think have reduced the levels 
of misunderstanding i dont want to leave you the wrong 
impression that i think the dialogue has resulted in a more 
dynamic peace process but i do think its i do think that its 
good and i think that it encourages moderation in the palestinian 
within the plo ranks 
i think the we lose sight of the fact that arafat did 
something that was predicted no palestinian leader could do when he 
recognized israels right to exist as a state and some might say 
well its about time and im one of them but that was quite 
a step forward 
it was quite a step forward when he recognized resolution 242 
and i think that was positive and then i think weve had a chance 
to solidify those gains modest though they might have been 
through dialogue 
but i cant point to the fact that that has really solved the 
question of middle east peace i just feel that talking offers more 
potential than stiffarming each other and yet we cant digest it 
as long as this this terroristic act is sticking in our throat 
and properly so as a country that decries international terror

q mr president a question about rafters here 
bush the rafters coming two rafter questions here 
q a question about space how serious are you about this 
lunarbased mars mission proposal would you go so far as to veto 
the bill that contains nasa appropriations if congress decides to 
delete all the money 
bush i havent even contemplated any veto strategy id like to 
get what i want i think its in the national interest i think 
that the united states must remain way out front on science and 
technology and this broad program that ive outlined seed money 
that ive asked for should be supported but im not i think 
its way too early to discuss veto strategy weve got to take one 
took one on the chops in a house committee the other day and 
ive got to turn around now and fight for what i believe 
yeah and then over to brit yeah 
q mr president how far will you go to protect the nasa budget 
in the future can you remove it from hud and give it to 
bush its pretty hard given the way congress functions and 
that is a function of the congress not of the executive branch to 
decide under what committees these budgets are budgets are worked 
but i think it is fair to say that i will fight for a 
fullyfunded space program weve put forward what i think is a 
bold one ive taken some shots saying hey how can you propose 
something this big when we have such a large deficit and i 
understand the question but were talking about stretched out 
were talking about stretchedout financing and were talking about 
hopefully a continued dynamic economy and between the two we can 
accommodate this goal if we all get with it 
brit up in the attic 
q was there not a need here sir to not appear to be indulgent 
of the plo at a time when the administration has been tougher than 
perhaps any recent administration has been to israel 
bush thats not what made my decision and i dont know that 
weve been tougher im the president of the united states and the 
united states has a policy and im supposed to i think go forward 
with our policy 
and one of the big problems we have had is the question between 
ourselves and the israeli government is this question of 
settlements but i dont i wouldnt read my decision here to go 
as follows he made this decision because hes concerned about a 
complicated relationship with israel at this point thats not 
why i made the decision 
but some may read it as that but we are we are staying with 
our concept on the peace process and we are staying and are 
staying with our policy on settlements and this action that i have 
taken today is consistent with our policy on antiterror 
q mr president 
bush yeah 
q do you feel that israel has committed acts of terrorism upon 
palestinians 
bush well we spoke out in the on recent recent violence in 
the gaza and please note my last comment to call for calling for 
peaceful resolution to these questions as opposed to violence and 
international terror and thats the way i would respond on that 
q why youre here in huntsville sir if you are here to help 
raise money for gov guy hunts gubernatorial campaign 
bush im not standing right here to do that but i was downtown 
doing exactly that and i hope we were successful because i am 
totally committed to his reelection i have respected the progress 
the state of alabama has made under his leadership and as i look 
at the way my philosophy of government works the governors are 
very very important on all this 
i cite not just the education summit in which i worked closely 
with guy but this whole concept that the states and localities 
have a significant role to play not just in the money end of it 
but in the whole setting of objectives and goals 
so im glad you raised it and yes im here that part of the 
trip was strongly to support him to support other political 
leaders too 
q mr president are you going to appoint an alabamian on the 
tva board 
bush maam 
q you have goals for your space initiative do you believe 
governor hunt can help you reach some of those by being so strong 
in the tennessee valley 
bush well i think hes a proponent of the space program that i 
have set forth i think hes got great credibility 
with other governors if im not mistaken i think hes hosting 
the national governors down here and thatll give him an 
opportunity to make the case for space or any other initiatives 
for but he is seen by other governors to know what he is talking 
about in this area and clearly to be a strong proponent so i guess 
the bottom line is yes i think governor hunt here can be helpful 
to our objectives of terms of a vibrant space program 
q mr president are you going to nominate or appoint governor 
hunts nominee to the tva board 
bush well i dont know that im going to carry my enthusiasm 
that far but laughter hes made a strong case for a person 
that he believes in and he did it in his typical way typical of 
guy hunt right direct he told me exactly why he favored a certain 
nominee and then seemed to be saying look i recognize that you 
have a lot of factors to weigh in this decision 
but i leave here understanding exactly why he has taken the 
position he has and i leave it and the position has respect and 
im not prepared to discuss further what i might or might not do in 
this tva youre talking about the tva appointment 
q can you say how long its going to take you to make an 
appointment 
bush a matter of days laughter 
reporters thank you 
bush thank you all very much

albanians will soon be entitled to hold a 
passport for travel abroad under new legislation liberalizing 
travel a further sign that the countrys leaders are abandoning 
their longtime isolationism 
travel for albanias 3 million citizens has been difficult if 
not impossible for decades 
but the communist leadership has signaled its willingness to 
increast foreign ties and grant citizens freedoms long denied under 
the rigid stalinist system imposed by the late leader enver hoxha 
under the new regulations all albanians age 16 and above will 
be entitled to apply for a passport valid for five years the 
albanian state news agency ata reported wednesday 
all the citizens of albania enjoy the right to be equipped 
with passports for traveling abroad the agency quoted ilmi 
muharremi the man in charge of visas and passports as saying 
he added however that this excluded the cases foreseen by 
the decree he did not elaborate on who could be denied a 
passport 
the ata dispatch was telexed from tirana 
the decree on granting passports was approved last week ata 
said it did not give a date for the new regulations to enter into 
force but indicated it could be next month 
travel to albania is also to be simplified in some cases 
muharremi indicated he told ata that foreigners who have obtained 
approval for their trip from albanian authorities can get the visa 
directly at the border 
muharremi said that 6200 albanians have been granted passports 
and traveled abroad recently he was not more specific 
albanian earlier this month pledged to adopt basic reforms and 
seek full membership in the conference on security and cooperation 
in europe 
albania is the only nation in europe that refused to sign the 
1975 helsinki agreements on security and human rights 
other cautious reforms announced in recent weeks include the 
abolition of the death penalty for those trying to flee the country 
and acceptance of religion officially banned for decades 
albanian leaders have announced they were also seeking to mend 
relations with the superpowers

an agency seeking corrective surgery for a 
6yearold boy born with clubfeet won a favorable ruling from the 
us supreme court but still has to find a hospital willing to 
perform the operation 
supreme court justice sandra day oconnor refused to set aside 
lower court rulings ordering the surgery on kou xiong who also was 
born with a dislocated hip the ruling was dated tuesday but 
released wednesday 
the boys parents hmong immigrants from laos oppose the 
surgery because they believe spirits would punish their extended 
family for tampering with the boys deformity 
valley childrens hospital in fresno and shriners hospital for 
crippled children in san francisco have refused to perform the 
operation without parental consent said fresno county department 
of social services director ernie velasquez 
velasquez said his agency would continue searching for a 
hospital that will perform the surgery but no operations would be 
scheduled until he meets with lawyers representing ger xiong and 
his wife houa vue xiong and hmong community leaders 
they truly believe that something bad will happen if the 
surgery takes place velasquez said those beliefs are very 
strong 
he said one way around the issue of parental consent would be 
making the boy a ward of the court im not so sure its a good 
option but its one of the options velasquez said 
dang vang president of hmong american human rights committee in 
fresno said the earlier superior court decision was a blow to the 
hmong communitys freedom of religion 
i talked with the family and they are very depressed and not 
just the family but all people across the country in the hmong 
communities vang said 
fresno county judge lawrence oneill ordered the operation in 
february after the social services agency notified by school 
officials of the boys deformity sought such help 
medical testimony during a twoday hearing before oneill 
indicated the boy would lose movement in his legs and be 
wheelchairbound by adulthood without the surgery 
however velasquez said that the orthopedic surgeon considered 
the key expert witness in the case says he would not perform the 
surgery without parental cooperation

scientists found the partial skeleton of an 
ice age bison in the mojave desert more evidence that the parched 
landscape once was forested and crossed by streams a researcher 
said wednesday 
the discovery of the 10700yearold fossil in red rock canyon 
state park was the first time researchers have found the partial 
skeleton of a large ice age animal in the vast desert said 
paleontologist david whistler curator of the natural history 
museum of los angeles county 
single bones of bison mammoths camels and horses had been 
found previously along with numerous bones of 25 other species 
including frogs lizards snakes shrews bats a mountain gopher 
and lemminglike creatures called voles he added 
the desert is no more than 10000 years old these fossils 
including the bison reinforce that knowledge whistler said 
this further confirms that the desert was once much cooler and 
much wetter 
at the time the bison roamed the mojave the area was a 
pinyonjuniper scrub forest like what youd find in northern 
arizona today he said adding that the types of fossilized 
creatures indicate the area also had lakes and yearround cold 
water streams 
whistler said that on may 27 a single fistsized vertebra from 
the bison was spotted in an ancient streambed in the state park by 
pam owen a paleontology graduate student at california state 
university long beach 
scientists then unearthed about onethird of the bisons 
skeleton which was broken in various pieces the rest of the bison 
had been exposed by erosion over the ages and had weathered away 
im afraid mother nature got about twothirds of it and we got 
about onethird whistler said weve got part of the chest 
part of a hip a shoulder blade a hind leg and about five 
isolated teeth 
red rock park officials asked whistler not to reveal the exact 
digging site but he said it was close to state route 14 the main 
highway through the park which is located about 100 miles north of 
los angeles 
the bisons worn teeth and arthritic bones show it was old when 
it died whistler said adding that the species went extinct and 
was different than modern bison 
radiocarbon dating of fossil wood in the streambed near the 
bison allowed scientists to determine it died about 10700 years 
ago 
museum spokeswoman ellen girardeau said the bison fossils will 
be used for research and wont be displayed they will be moved to 
los angeles late this month

president bush broke off americas 
dialogue with the palestine liberation organization wednesday 
saying a guerrilla raid on israels coast is sticking in our 
throat and must be renounced by yasser arafat for the 
relationship to resume 
weve given the plo ample time to deal with this issue bush 
said at a news conference at the marshall space flight center in 
the midst of a day of campaigning for republicans in alabama and 
north carolina 
bush said israeli civilians were clearly the target of the may 
30 raid for which the palestine liberation front has taken 
responsibility the plf is headed by abul abbas an arafat 
associate and a member of the plo executive committee 
the attack was thwarted when israeli defenders intercepted five 
speedboats when they landed four guerrillas were killed and 12 
captured the boats carrying 16 guerrillas armed with rockets and 
machine guns reportedly were dropped off a libyan ship 120 miles 
at sea 
this terroristic act is sticking in our throat bush said 
declaring he was acting even though his decision could incite new 
violence in the mideast 
bush said he was willing to reopen the talks which enhanced 
arafats standing in the arab world if the plo condemns the raid 
dissociates itself from the action and moves to discipline abbas 
who bush said was the perpetrator 
bush noted that the plo did dissociate itself from the action 
but said that and a general condemnation of violence against 
civilians was not enough 
the plo last week said 
the plo position remains unchanged we are against any 
military action that targets civilians whatever form it may take 
secertary of state james a baker iii who had recommended 
bushs action told reporters flying with him to europe for talks 
on german unity that israel still needs the acquiescence of the plo 
to find a partner for peace talks he admitted that bush action 
could hurt moderate arabs 
without plo consent there wont be a dialogue for israel 
they israeli governments have been seeking to develop one for 22 
years and none has come forward baker said before a refueling 
stop at shannon ireland 
bushs decision disrupts a relationship with the plo started by 
thenpresident reagan in december 1988 after arafat met two us 
conditions he disavowed terrorism and recognized israels right to 
exist 
the decision comes at a time when us efforts to induce israel 
to revive the middle east peace process have run out of energy 
israel welcomed the administrations decision a statement 
issued by the embassy in washington said bushs decision will 
encourage those palestinians seeking peace with israel to seize 
upon this opportunity to begin a direct dialogue with israel 
the league of arab states called the suspension of the dialogue 
a blow to peace and said it signals a penalty to arab 
moderation especially palestinian moderation and rewards 
israeli intransigence 
and faisal husseini one of the leading palestinian nationalists 
in the israelioccupied west bank said the united states was 
punishing the wrong people israel he said in an interview in 
washington was refusing to match the concessions made by the plo 
this will make the radicals and all those who oppose peace 
strong he said 
yael dayan daughter of the late israeli general moshe dayan 
said cutting off the dialogue opens the doors to war ms 
dayan who is touring the united states with husseini on behalf of 
the israeli peace now movement said bushs decision signals the 
burial of a slow process that had barely begun 
on capitol hill the speaker of the house rep thomas s foley 
dwash said he supported bushs decision 
i think the president sought to find a way to conscientiously 
continue this dialogue but it has to be one in which conditions 
which we set forth are respected foley said 
rep william broomfield of michigan the senior republican on 
the house foreign affairs committee also hailed bushs action 
america must let arafat know that the plo cant talk peace and 
wage war at the same time he said adding 
president bush was wise to suspend rather than terminate the 
talks arafat should know that the united states is still willing 
to cooperate in the search for peace but not under the barrel of a 
gun 
the reagan administrations willingness to talk directly with 
the plo had bolstered arafats claim to be the foremost spokesman 
for palestinians and for their goal of achieving statehood 
the palestine liberation front which abbas heads is a radical 
plo faction 
even after the raid contacts continued between the united 
states and the plo while the united states awaited the plos 
response robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia 
met with plo officials outside tunis several times 
the plo had played an offstage role in the bush administrations 
attempt to reignite the peace process egypt acting as an 
intermediary checked with the plo as baker put together a formula 
for setting up talks in cairo between israel and palestinian arabs 
that effort had been stalled since march when the israeli 
coalition government collapsed 
bush recently wrote prime minister yitzhak shamir who heads the 
newly formed israeli government in an attempt to revive the peace 
process through cabinet secretary eliakim rubinstein the 
government in jerusalem has promised to pursue peace with the arabs 
last march the state department in a report to congress said 
the plo was adhering to arafats commitment to disavow terrorism 
although palestinian groups have launched nearly 30 border and 
rocket attacks against israel since the usplo talks began the 
report said we have no evidence in those cases or any others 
that the actions were authorized or approved by the plo executive 
committee or by arafat personally 
on other subjects in his meeting with reporters bush 
said he has no plans for a bold new initiative to help 
mikhail gorbachev cope with the ailing soviet economy he said his 
administration is willing to talk with allies about helping the 
soviet union some western nations are reported to favor a costly 
plan to assist gorbachev 
defended his press secretary marlin fitzwater for his 
comments on tuesday critical of democrats on the savings and loan 
bailout issue he said fitzwater was doing no more than 
responding to a couple of shots across my bow 
said he would tell nelson mandela next week that american 
sanctions against south africa will remain in place until 
conditions fixed under law are met he also paid a tribute to south 
african president fw de klerk for what hes done to start 
dismantling apartheid hes come a long way bush said

president bush says hes willing to 
resume the newly suspended talks with the palestine liberation 
organization if yasser arafat denounces a recent foiled terrorist 
attack on an israeli beach 
the president who announced the suspension wednesday said the 
plo has not provided a credible account of this incident in 
which a plo affiliate group launched a guerrilla attack on the 
civilianfilled beach near tel aviv 
weve given the plo ample time to deal with this issue but 
plo leader arafat has refused to denounce it or discipline the 
leader of the group the radical palestine liberation front bush 
said at a news conference during a oneday political trip to 
alabama and north carolina 
the president said the administration is willing to resume the 
talks if arafat fulfills those conditions bush said he believes 
the 18month usplo dialogue has encouraged moderation within the 
plo 
but i cant point to the fact that that has really solved the 
question of middle east peace i just feel that talking offers more 
potential than stiffarming each other he said and yet we 
cant digest it as long as this terroristic act is sticking in our 
throat 
bush spoke during a trip to the marshall space flight center in 
huntsville on a day otherwise devoted to fundraising for 
republican gov guy hunt in alabama and sen jesse helms in north 
carolina 
the president helped raise 450000 for hunts bid for a second 
term and about 1 million for helms fight against democrat harvey 
gantt aides said 
he attacked a house appropriations subcommittee that last week 
axed 300 million from his proposal to send manned flights back to 
the moon and on to mars 
touching on other matters at the news conference the president 
said 
parents who work for employers who do not give parental leave 
time as he urges them to do should keep working for them until 
they do because he does not believe the government should require 
firms to offer such leave 
he has no plans to support a european move for an international 
economic aid package for the soviet union although he is willing 
to discuss the matter with the allies 
his press secretary marlin fitzwater acted appropriately in 
lambasting democrats for partisanship in their criticisms on the 
governments massive savings and loan bailout 
said he would tell nelson mandela next week that american 
sanctions against south africa will remain in place until 
conditions fixed under law are met he also paid a tribute to south 
african president fw de klerk for steps toward dismantling 
apartheid hes come a long way bush said 
on the plo question the president said the evidence shows that 
civilians clearly were the target of the may 30 terrorist attempt 
in which the perpetrators were intercepted by israeli military 
forces before they could harm anyone four guerrillas were killed 
and 12 captured 
secretary of state james a baker iii who recommended the 
suspension defended the decision even while admitting it would 
hurt moderate arabs we really could not let our pursuit of peace 
stand in the way of our commitment to fight terrorism baker said 
while en route to east berlin for german reunification talks 
the us talks with the plo began in 1988 after arafat complied 
with us conditions that he renounce terrorism and back the right 
of israel to exist 
the plo last week insisted that it opposes any military action 
that targets civilians but bush said wednesday that that generic 
statement is not enough and he expects a specific condemnation of 
the may 30 action 
israel praised the president in a statement from its embassy in 
washington saying his decision will encourage palestinians who 
want peace to seize upon this opportunity to begin a direct 
dialogue with israel 
the league of arab states however said bushs suspension of 
the talks signals a penalty to arab moderation especially 
palestinian moderation and rewards israeli intransigence 
yael dayan daughter of the late israeli general moshe dayan 
said cutting off the dialogue opens the doors to war ms 
dayan who is touring the united states for the israeli peace now 
movement lamented the burial of a slow process that had barely 
begun 
on capitol hill house speaker thomas s foley dwash backed 
bushs move saying the president sought to find a way to 
conscientiously continue this dialogue but it has to be one in 
which conditions which we set forth are respected

no one wants to be the abortion doctor in 
north dakota 
the only doctor in the state who performed abortions retired 
earlier this year none of the states 1200 doctors has come 
forward to take the place of dr robert lucy a obstetrician and 
gynecologist he predicts no one will 
peer pressure from colleagues is the main reason said lucy 
who practiced in jamestown 100 miles west of here theyre also 
afraid of public pressure 
abortions still are performed at a womens clinic in fargo but 
it has to fly doctors in from neighboring minnesota 
women in the western part of the state must drive up to 350 
miles to fargo on the states eastern side some have driven all 
night in bad weather 
the distance adds to hurdles this conservative mostly rural 
state has put up to restrict abortions 
in north dakota a minor seeking an abortion must have the 
consent of both parents or a judge the state allows no public 
financing for abortions and prohibits abortions at public hospitals 
our patients are pretty persistent said jane bovard 
director of the womens clinic which operates out of a white 
clapboard house on a quiet city street theyve made up their 
mind and they get here no matter what 
a 21yearold patient who did not want to give her name said she 
was getting an abortion because she has a 4yearold child is 
getting divorced and is on welfare 
i want to go to school she said maybe its selfish of 
me i dont know but if i go to school i can provide my child with 
a better life 
the clinic owned by the national womens health organization 
performs abortions twice a week last year it performed 1308 or 
about 25 a week this year it is averaging about 36 a week bovard 
said the cost is 275 to 300 
after years of picketing outside lucys clinic abortion foes 
were thrilled when he announced his retirement they hope the fargo 
clinic will go next 
i believe god is closing down the centers in north dakota and 
hell close this one too said aletha schommer one of a handful 
of protesters outside the clinic last week 
schommer who drove four hours from her home in munich to join 
the pickets shouted mother dont kill your baby at women 
entering the clinic she seemed unperturbed by the angry gestures 
with which some women responded 
by coming here ive become a more loving person she said 
we dont want to personally harm them we just want them to 
stop 
inside the clinic a man who brought his 16yearold daughter 
for an abortion was angry at the protesters he refused to identify 
himself 
you can believe whatever you want about abortion until it 
happens to your family he said then youve got to make a 
decision and its not easy 
and then to have people screaming at you what kind of people 
would do that he added 
bovard said antiabortion activists are fooling themselves if 
they think they can close the clinic which opened in 1981 
i know what we do is within the law she said the crazy 
things these people do out front here will hang them eventually 
lucy said the protesters had no bearing on his decision to 
retire after 42 years of practicing medicine 
i felt i performed a service he said if they wanted to 
carry a pregnancy to term i could take care of it if they wanted 
to terminate it i could still take care of it so they had a 
choice thats why i did it

a free trade pact between the united states 
and mexico would create a market of 400 million north american 
consumers and supporters say put more goods on shelves all over 
the continent 
but some union leaders are asking who will get the additional 
money to buy those goods 
president bush and president carlos salinas de gortari of mexico 
agreed earlier this month to talk about a free trade agreement like 
the one between the united states and canada 
but the heads of the largest unions in canada and the united 
states argue that an agreement with mexico would push wages down in 
the two other countries 
us trade and investment with mexico has already 
significantly harmed the domestic manufacturing sector said lane 
kirkland president of the aflcio kirkland and shirley carr head 
of the canadian labor congress voiced their opposition to the pact 
during a recent visit with bush 
tens of thousands of american workers have lost their jobs or 
seen employment opportunities vanish as us companies move to take 
advantage of the poverty of mexican workers kirkland said 
the average us worker in manufacturing earns 1450 an hour 
and the average canadian not much less the average mexican gets 
only 190 
under a free trade accord a us auto manufacturer could make 
parts much more cheaply in mexico than in the united states or 
canada the result more jobs in mexico and fewer jobs up north 
where the manufacturer sells a lot more vehicles 
that could happen in the short run acknowledged claude 
barfild who worked for the us trade representative under 
president reagan but in the longer run both stockholders and 
workers will get the money mexicans who make auto parts will be 
able to ask and get higher wages 
since the 1940s he said wages in countries that export to the 
united states have been rising toward american levels wages in 
some european countries are higher than here said barfild a 
fellow at the american enterprise institute a conservative 
research group on public policy 
the wage question was discussed last week at the first 
congressional hearing on the proposed pact with mexico witnesses 
said a major purpose of the pact would be to encourage investors 
from the united states and elsewhere to put factories in mexico 
rather than in lowwage countries on other continents 
a north american trade alliance of the us canada and mexico 
will allow us to better compete with other emerging trading blocs 
in europe and asia and maintain our competitiveness around the 
globe said rep jim kolbe rariz a trading bloc from the 
yukon to the yucatan with upwards of 400 million in population 
would be the most powerful in the world 
rudiger dornbusch who teaches economics at the massachusetts 
institute of technology said manufacturers would in any case build 
factories where wages are low in mexico asia africa or europe 
the right question to ask about free trade with mexico is 
whether we should prefer that when jobs do go abroad that they go 
south rather than to asia he said

and teenagers will end up in hospital emergency rooms this year 
from injuries associated with fireworks said cpsc chairwoman 
jacqueline jonessmith

prevented said commissioner anne graham she said parents should

the house is overwhelmingly recommending an 
increase in social security benefits for some working elderly 
recipients telling its negotiators to accept that senateapproved 
provision in a child care bill 
the house voted 38436 wednesday for a nonbinding motion to 
instruct its conferees on the bill it acted despite warnings by 
opponents that the benefit increases for working retirees would 
come at the expense of new programs 
it means a difficult choice between generations said rep 
thomas downey dny a leading sponsor of the child care bill 
the vote came as the measure appeared to become more deeply 
mired in legislative disagreement 
bills establishing major new child care programs and expanding 
others including the head start program have followed a tortuous 
path leading to house and senate approval of far different packages 
the measures remain in two senatehouse conference committees 
created to resolve those differences and one of the panels earlier 
this week produced a preliminary agreement on several provisions 
that plan would keep the senates plan for a new categorical block 
grant child care program instead of the house versions expansion 
of entitlement programs 
that agreement appeared to run counter to house wishes the 
chamber voted 4110 on may 9 not to instruct conferees not to 
accept those senate provisions on the main elements of a child care 
bill 
the house on wednesday pointed to that vote and delivered a 
direct rebuke to its own conferees it voted 4160 on a second 
nonbinding motion reaffirming its opposition to the senate version 
members said that accepting the senates provisions would prompt 
president bushs veto as well as lose important house support 
neither vote binds the conferees but they amount to recorded 
expressions of the chambers sentiment 
the motion on social security instructs the conferees to modify 
and accept the senates rider allowing people 65 to 69 years old 
to earn more money through working while continuing to receive 
their retirement benefits 
rep hank brown rcolo said it would relieve a devastating 
penalty that social security recipients must pay for continuing 
to work often part time 
opponents said the change in social security policy has no place 
in a child care bill and should await congressional budget talks 
with the white house and other panels deliberating social security 
changes 
it would be truly unfortunate if we forgot that we are here to 
provide help to children who would otherwise be left alone said 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee 
the provision added by the senate would raise the annual 
earnings limitation for social security recipients by 1200 to 
10560 for those earning up to 5000 beyond that social 
security benefits would be reduced by 1 for every 4 earned 
brown recommended altering the senates provision by delaying 
the change in benefit reduction and recalculating lumpsum payments 
in the awarding of back benefits for some social security 
recipients this in effect would reduce one benefit to pay for 
increasing another 
the house budget committee chairman rep leon panetta 
dcalif estimated the bills cost at 15 billion to 24 
billion but brown said the lumpsum reduction would produce more 
than enough money to pay for the increase in the earnings 
limitation 
it has no effect at all on child care brown said it in 
no way limits or restricts the funds available for child care

its shaping up as a possible record year for 
farm income according to new forecasts by the agriculture 
department 
sales of farm commodities are showing some unexpected 
strength so income prospects have brightened since the last 1990 
forecast was issued three months ago the departments economic 
research service said wednesday 
strong hog prices and firming coarse grain prices are behind 
the improvement the report said coarse grains include corn 
sorghum oats and barley 
overall the net cash income of farmers was forecast at 55 
billion to 59 billion this year up 1 billion from the range 
indicated since march last years net cash income was about 54 
billion and the record was 572 billion in 1988 
as used by the agency net cash income measures the value of 
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments less 
outofpocket costs some commodities sold actually may have been 
produced in earlier years and stored until marketed 
direct government payments to farmers in 1990 are expected to 
drop about 15 percent from last year to a range of 8 billion to 
10 billion the report said 
in another method of accounting the report said net farm 
income may be in the range of 47 billion to 51 billion a 2 
billion increase from the earlier 1990 forecast last years was 
49 billion a record 
net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural 
production whether sold or stored in a calendar year plus 
government payments minus all costs including depreciation and 
other allowances 
the report said world wheat production is expected to exceed 
consumption in 199091 leading to the first increase in stockpiles 
in four years however supplies of corn and other coarse gains 
probably will drop for the fourth straight year despite larger 
output this year 
so wheat prices are slipping while coarse grain prices are 
expected to remain firm the report said wheat will figure more 
prominently in livestock feeds as producers try to hold down 
costs 
in the united states unusually heavy rains have slowed the 
planting of corn soybeans and rice this spring meaning that some 
farmers will switch to soybeans and sorghum 
looking at the rural economy the report said unemployment in 
the first quarter was unchanged from a year earlier at 66 percent 
after declining in rural areas for four years 
rural areas are expected to see more moderate job growth and 
stable unemployment rates for the rest of the year the report 
said and rural jobless rates probably will remain above urban 
rates over half of all farmers now hold offfarm jobs

the agriculture department says egg producers 
will vote next month on whether to eliminate refunds permanently 
under a federal research and promotion program 
daniel d haley administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said wednesday that ballots will be mailed by 
july 16 to all producers of record 
all commercial egg producers owning more than 30000 laying hens 
during the period jan 1 through march 31 1990 except those who 
produce mostly hatching eggs will be eligible to vote 
in 1988 congress amended the egg research and consumer 
information act to suspend refunds for 18 months beginning jan 1 
1989 pending results of a national referendum 
for the new provision to be adopted approval would have to come 
from at least twothirds of those voting this summer or a majority 
of producers representing at least twothirds of the volume of eggs 
produced by all voters 
if adopted producers will continue to pay mandatory 
nonrefundable assessments of five cents per 30dozen case of 
commercial eggs to the american egg board for research promotion 
and consumer education programs 
exemptions would continue for producers with flocks of 30000 or 
fewer hens and for all egg producers in alaska and hawaii 
currently the assessments raise about 72 million annually 
the agency said

recent surveys show that almost 20 percent of

obtain loans 
the agriculture department said wednesday that the surveys were 
for crop insurance bought in the 198889 season 
of those who said they had to buy the insurance before getting 
a loan almost half dealt with commercial banks the departments 
economic research service said in its report 
roughly another onethird borrowed from the farmers home 
administration and one out of seven from the farm credit system 
farmers were more likely to say they had to buy the insurance 
if they borrowed primarily from one source the report said

federal aviation officials say they will 
closely watch operations of a charter air service that was allowed 
to resume flying last month after being shut down for safety 
violations 
the operation nicknamed celebrity airline because it 
carried rock stars politicians and other wellknown passengers 
came under intense scrutiny during a twoday congressional hearing 
that ended wednesday 
tony broderick head of regulation and certification for the 
federal aviation administration said northeast jet operating as 
personal jet services met rigorous faa qualifications to gain a 
new certificate 
the faa pulled the allentown pa airlines operating 
certificate in september 1988 accusing the service of overworking 
its pilots skimping on training and keeping two sets of 
maintenance records one for its own use and one for faa inspectors 
the owners denied the allegations but decided to seek a new 
certification a year later rather than appeal 
the house public works investigations subcommittee has been 
looking into faa oversight of northeast jet and the 3000 other 
us air charter and taxi services that carry more than 8 million 
passengers a year 
the hearings focused on northeast jet because its owner had 
managed to get a new certification after being shut down for safety 
violations some lawmakers accused the faa of having a revolving 
door policy of recertifying airlines whose licenses are pulled 
broderick testified that the case was unusual and that 
revocation of a flight certificate was usually a death sentence 
for an airline 
he said faa inspectors would pay especially close attention to 
private jet which has only been operating for a few weeks and has 
only one plane because of its previous violations 
we often apply extra surveillance to carriers who have 
received a new certificate after having a certificate previously 
revoked broderick said 
he said 100 small airlines have been shut down because of safety 
problems over the last five years 
no special preference is given carriers that try to reapply for 
certification after being shut down for a year or more broderick 
said 
the faa does not have the power to permanently ban a company 
from flying but must reevaluate it based on operations when it 
files a new application he said 
northeast jet gained the nickname celebrity airlines after 
flying clients such as first ladies nancy reagan and barbara bush 
presidential hopefuls michael dukakis and sen bob dole rkan 
and pop singers billy idol bruce springsteen and barry manilow 
company president earl holtz said he would carry anyone who 
pays but his lawyer mark kahan said most passengers are business 
travelers

the pentagon is appealing to congress to 
extend special benefits and severance pay to activeduty enlisted 
personnel who will be forced out as the armed services grow smaller 
defense secretary dick cheney sent to congress on wednesday a 
proposal that would provide separation pay for enlisted men and 
women in uniform with at least five years service 
this benefit will be particularly important to those 
noncommissioned officers who dont serve long enough to retire 
but who nevertheless have dedicated a big part of their working 
lives to the nations service cheney said in a statement 
currently separation pay is only given to activeduty officers 
and reserve enlisted personnel who have served for at least five 
years the payment is based on a years base pay 
under the defense secretarys plan the separation pay would be 
10 percent of the base pay times the number of years of service 
the pentagon envisions cutting the size of the 
21millionmember activeduty force by at least 90000 in the next 
two years although further budget reductions could raise that 
number 
while cheney made his appeal his senior enlisted advisers urged 
lawmakers to adopt legislation that would help ease the impact of 
significant cuts in the defense budget 
recent debate over reductions in president bushs 3033 billion 
budget has focused on air force fighter wings army divisions navy 
ships and base closings 
but the pentagon advisers testifying before the senate armed 
services subcommittee on manpower and personnel put the reductions 
in personal terms 
spouses and even some of the children are becoming uneasy with 
the future outlook sgt maj of the army julius w gates told 
the panel 
duane bushey master chief petty officer of the navy said the 
overriding concern among enlisted sailors let go after more than 
five years on the job is not an improvement in their education 
benefits but enough separation pay 
at that point theyre looking to survive they want to put 
meat and potatoes on the table most with a family are looking to 
feed the family bushey said 
gates said army personnel are not asking for free handouts or 
welfare 
last month sens john mccain rariz and william cohen 
rmaine introduced legislation that would ease the pain for 
military personnel from the cuts in defense spending 
the bill is a package of severance pay health benefits and 
relocation and job counseling for those forced out of the service 
with more than seven years experience and before they are eligible 
for retirement 
the current pentagon system caps the severance pay at 30000 
the senate legislation would increase the limit to 83500 
we have a personnel crisis of nearly unprecedented 
proportions mccain said at the hearing 
later in the day senate and house democrats introduced 
legislation that will assist the nations communities that have 
been dependent on the defense buildup of the 1980s as they adjust 
to reduced military spending 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo touted the 
measure as a plan to move our economy from a cold war footing to 
a new era of vitality 
the bill would create a highlevel federal office to assist 
defense adjustment provide grants to communities to start 
adjustment planning and require advance notification to 
communities workers and businesses of planned cuts

president bush says he wants to cooperate with 
democrats in congress to clean up the savings and loan mess but 
hes also endorsing remarks from his spokesman singling out 
democrats for criticism 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater had gone on the 
offensive tuesday inviting reporters to examine the contributions 
to the crisis of specific democrats 
marlin properly seeing a couple of shots across my bow from 
certain distinguished members of the united states senate decided 
not to acquiesce in those attacks without some response what he 
did was appropriate bush said wednesday 
the spokesman had singled out for criticism sens donald w 
riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate banking committee 
dennis deconcini dariz and bob kerrey dneb former house 
speaker jim wright dtexas and former reps tony coelho 
dcalif and fernand j st germain dri 
however bush told reporters at the marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala what im trying to do is not respond to 
individuals and to simply keep moving forward on this process 
he conceded that a spark seemed to be ignited by fitzwaters 
comments but added i think more important than continuing to 
pour fuel on the spark is to work cooperatively with the congress 
in trying to get this mess solved 
the president defended his administrations pursuit of sampl 
fraud saying there has been an active prosecution under way 
he said impressive numbers of cases were being pursued and i 
expect well see plenty more 
meanwhile the house voted 4201 wednesday to provide the 
justice department with 75 million to fight whitecollar crime in 
financial institutions during the 1991 fiscal year beginning oct 
1 at the administrations request congress had provided 50 
million for 1990 an amount democrats said was inadequate 
democratic criticism of bushs management of the sampl bailout has 
been growing since last month when the administration said 
congress would have to provide a second bailout of 30 billion to 
50 billion later this year 
public citizens congress watch an organization affiliated with 
consumer activist ralph nader issued a report wednesday 
criticizing the administrations anemic efforts to prosecute 
sampl fraud 
the report estimated that the governments civil and criminal 
actions have recovered only 300 million in sampl losses that is 
less than 2 percent of the 163 billion in losses attributed to 
fraud among the 440 sampls seized by the government since early last 
year the group said 
the bush administrations efforts to pursue and punish sampl 
fraud have been anemic at best irresponsible at worst said 
sherry ettleson an attorney who prepared the report 
congress watch said the justice department is pursuing 891 cases 
actively compared with a backlog of 6993 cases yet the 
department has added fewer than half the 425 additional agents 
requested by the fbi and only 118 of the 231 assistant us 
attorneys requested by the departments field offices it said 
the group recommended that the administration spend more on 
pursuing fraud turn its attention to accountants and lawyers who 
aided sampl executives in committing fraud and drop its support of 
legislation that would remove the threat of triple damages from 
civil racketeering suits 
it said congress should enact legislation that would permit 
whistleblowers to bring suit against alleged sampl criminals on 
behalf of the government and share in the damages if fraud is found 
to have occurred

convicted drug dealer charles lewis got a 
sweet deal from the government in exchange for damaging 
testimony that mayor marion barry staged a coverup of his own 
cocaine use barrys lawyer contends 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy said wednesday that lewis 
testimony is influenced by the fact that he still hopes to get a 
justice department recommendation of leniency when he is sentenced 
for a drug conviction in his native virgin islands 
if you testify to exonerate the mayor you wouldnt get 
that letter of leniency mundy stated flatly during lewis second 
day of testimony in barrys cocaine and perjury trial in us 
district court 
my testimony isnt to convict the mayor lewis insisted he 
said he is simply trying to testify completely and truthfully 
lewis acknowledged that he didnt start cooperating with the 
government until he was convicted in the virgin islands drug case 
in 1989 but he insisted that the agreement with the government 
wasnt like a present 
lewis recently was released from prison after serving seven 
months on two drugrelated charges perjury charges have been 
dropped 
you got a pretty sweet deal didnt you said mundy 
i dont have anything to measure it by lewis replied 
except selfpreservation the lawyer suggested 
lewis testified that he and barry smoked crack cocaine on four 
occasions in december 1988 at lewis hotel room lewis said that an 
hour after barry brought a crack pipe to the room and smoked crack 
there lewis found out from a washington post reporter that he was 
under suspicion by police for involvement with drugs 
in a telephone call later in the day lewis and barry agreed 
lewis would tell police the same thing he had told the reporter 
that there were no drugs in lewis room and that neither the mayor 
nor lewis used any drugs 
did you and mr barry talk about what you were going to tell 
the police assistant us attorney judith retchin asked 
yes lewis replied 
what was your understanding retchin asked 
i would tell the police the same thing i told the post 
reporter replied lewis 
the truth or a lie retchin asked 
i told the post reporter a lie and therefore i would be 
telling the police a lie lewis testified 
in a later phone conversation with barry lewis said he was 
concerned about a possible drug test the police might administer 
when he went in for an interview 
he said he asked barry if there was anything he could he do to 
get the drugs out of his system 
he said yes lewis recalled lemon juice and lots of 
water 
retchin asked lewis what he did 
i used a considerable amount of lemon juice and lots of 
water he replied as the courtroom erupted in laughter 
lewis said he lied to the police and later to a federal grand 
jury barry also testified to the grand jury saying he and lewis 
hadnt ever exchanged cocaine and that he didnt know of any 
involvement by lewis with drugs 
those statements form the basis of the three felony counts of 
perjury against barry the threeterm mayor also is accused of one 
misdemeanor count of conspiracy and nine counts of cocaine 
possession 
at one point wednesday barry bantered with reporters about 
lewis and other government witnesses who will testify against him 
the canaries are singing the mayor quipped 
a whole flock of them one reporter responded 
yeah theyre coming in droves barry agreed with a smile

members of the house ethics committee 
reportedly are deeply split over how severely to punish rep barney 
frank for his ties to a male prostitute and how soon to bring the 
matter to a vote 
those who favor a light sanction against the massachusetts 
democrat are pushing for a vote next week after months of deadlock 
face strong opposition from panel members seeking a tougher 
penalty congressional sources said wednesday 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
committee of six democrats and six republicans could find itself 
with a 66 split on the punishment question the tie could be 
mostly but not totally along partisan lines 
a mild punishment for frank would be a letter from the committee 
criticizing his behavior more serious would be a vote by the full 
house to either reprimand censure or expel frank one of congress 
most outspoken liberals 
any mild sanction approved by the panel formally the committee 
on standards of official conduct is almost certain to be 
challenged on the floor in an attempt to upgrade the punishment 
the committee will meet next tuesday and wednesday through 
months of stalemate the panel has found it extremely difficult to 
deal with a members personal behavior rather than his official 
actions 
while there typically is vigorous debate in the committees 
closed meetings in such investigations the final decision is 
usually unanimous 
but two sources said democratic members favoring a milder 
punishment no longer want to wait for unanimity and believe the 
case should be settled before the july 4 recess 
one of these sources who favors action next week said weve 
investigated everything theres not a lot more to do than decide 
it 
one consideration is whether frank violated the houses 
catchall rule 43 clause 1 which says a member officer or 
employee of the house of representatives shall conduct himself at 
all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the house 
of representatives 
a floor debate is almost certain because rep william e 
dannemeyer rcalif has promised to push for an expulsion 
resolution and others reportedly will introduce resolutions for 
reprimand or censure 
reprimand and censure both require a resolution criticizing a 
member but censure forces him to stand before his colleagues as 
the content is read 
frank has acknowledged hiring prostitute stephen l gobie for 
sex in 1985 
the lawmaker an acknowledged homosexual said he subsequently 
hired gobie as an aide and driver and paid him with personal funds 
gobie has said he used franks former capitol hill apartment for 
a prostitution ring with the lawmakers knowledge frank strongly 
denied knowing of the illicit business 
some parts of the case center on franks official duties gobie 
said the two men had sex in the house gymnasium and he contended 
that frank invoked congressional privilege to waive parking tickets 
incurred by gobie while using frankss car to keep appointments for 
illicit sex 
frank said he fired gobie in august 1987 after learning of the 
prostitution ring the lawmaker denied the sexinthegym 
allegation and said he asked for the waiver of parking tickets 
incurred only while the car was used for official house business

pentagon planners want to triple spending on 
the star wars antimissile system over the next six years a senate 
panel chairman says 
sen james exon dneb said defense secretary dick cheneys 
internal budget planning documents show a projected spending total 
of 58 billion for the 199297 period for star wars known 
officially as the strategic defense initiative or sdi 
the average of 10 billion a year that the secretary is 
requesting is far far above what we have ever provided in previous 
years even in years when we didnt have a budget crunch said 
exon chairman of the senate armed services subcommittee on 
strategic forces and nuclear deterrence 
charles m herzfeld director of defense research and 
engineering at the pentagon told exon at a hearing wednesday that 
he could not discuss the budget figure openly because it was 
classified 
star wars research is aimed at developing nonnuclear weapons 
radars and sensors based in space and on the ground to detect and 
shoot down ballistic missiles the total cost is estimated at 
between 55 billion and 140 billion 
herzfeld and other pentagon officials testified that greatly 
increased spending on sdi was justified despite the waning threat 
of a superpower war 
while the nature and scope of the threats we face are 
changing we find that strategic defenses can provide a unique and 
vital contribution to our defense posture said stephen j 
hadley assistant defense secretary for international security 
policy 
the current sdi budget is 35 billion and the figure has 
averaged 33 billion over the past five years the bush 
administration is requesting 46 billion for the coming fiscal 
year which begins oct 1 but congress is expected to cut that 
sharply 
exon said he supports sdi which was launched by former 
president reagan in 1983 but sees no way congress will approve any 
increases in spending for it 
im sitting on the realistic side of the table exon told 
lt gen george l monahan jr director of the pentagon office 
that administers sdi 
monahan who is retiring at the end of the month said 
substantial increases in sdi spending will be necessary if the 
pentagon is to meet president bushs goal of deciding by 1993 
whether to deploy a ballistic missile defense

if 29 senators have their way goldcolored 
11sided dollar coins commemorating christopher columbus will soon 
be jingling in americans pockets 
however the bush administration and the congressional general 
accounting office say the coins will simply occupy space in 
government vaults unless congress simultaneously moves to end the 
availability of dollar bills 
the government could save an average of 381 million a year by 
minting dollar coins l nye stevens of the gao told the senate 
banking committee on wednesday 
but he warned we think these savings are unlikely to occur 
unless congress and the administration jointly resolve not only to 
eliminate the dollar note but also stand up to a negative public 
reaction that should be fully anticipated 
stevens said australia canada japan britain and other 
european nations succeeded in introducing highdenomination coins 
only after they eliminated the corresponding paper bills 
donna v pope director of the us mint pointed to the susan 
b anthony dollar coin minted in 1979 and 1980 as an object 
lesson about 425 million of the coins half of the total struck 
are still sitting in us mint and federal reserve vaults 
nevertheless sen pete domenici rnm and 28 cosponsors are 
offering legislation authorizing the columbus dollar which would 
be slightly larger than a quarter and be 90 percent copper it 
would not eliminate the dollar bill 
domenici who represents a copperproducing state conceded that 
some americans are reluctant to change but he said his dollar coin 
would win acceptance because its color and shape would clearly 
differentiate it from other coins 
anyone who rides a city bus purchases a sunday newspaper from a 
machine or makes longdistance calls from a pay phone will 
recognize the convenience of carrying a few dollar coins rather 
than a pocket full of quarters he said 
due to inflation the 1 bill today buys about what a quarter 
purchased in 1950 domenici said 
taxpayers will save money he added the government currently 
prints 32 billion dollar bills a year at an average cost of 26 
cents dollar coins would cost 6 cents each but they would last 20 
or more years in contrast with the 16month life of the average 
greenback domenici said 
commercial banks are opposing domenicis bill and a similar one 
introduced in the house by rep jim kolbe rariz who unlike 
domenici would phase out dollar bills 
the american bankers association says it would cost more for 
financial institutions to handle and transport dollar coins which 
would weigh 17 pounds per 1000 as opposed to bills which weigh 3 
pounds per 1000

striking greyhound drivers say they will obey 
a government ceaseanddesist order not to shout vile epithets 
at replacement workers or wave threatening signs at them 
a national labor relations board order also prohibits the 
strikers from firing guns throwing firebombs playing cat and 
mouse with buses or making throatslashing motions at 
strikebreakers 
this will put the full force and authority of the federal 
government to work in our campaign to stop the violence against 
greyhound lines the bus lines vice president anthony lannie 
said wednesday 
the company called the nlrb order a major development in the 
3monthold strike 
but union officials shrugged off its significance noting they 
have not admitted any part of the dozens of shootings or 
rockthrowing incidents that have taken place during the drivers 
strike 
we dont believe theres that kind of conduct going on act 
this time and furthermore we dont believe the union is behind 
it said earle putnam an attorney for the amalgamated transit 
union 
we consented to this because we never condoned nor encouraged 
nor ratified any violence this says we will not do what the law 
says we cannot do and which we never did in the first place 
putnam said 
the nlrb approved the order on tuesday but it is agency policy 
not to publicly announce it until both parties receive it 
most of the shootings occurred during the first two months of 
the strike but greyhound officials say assaults and intimidating 
acts are still occurring the bus line which filed for bankruptcy 
two weeks ago has been operating with 3200 replacement drivers it 
hired 
the order stems from an unfair labor practice complaint the nlrb 
filed against the union more than a month ago over violence in the 
strike 
the nlrb has also filed charges against greyhound for attempting 
to implement a contract before an impasse in negotiations had 
occurred the company is appealing that charge 
rather than appeal the violencerelated complaint the transit 
union which represents the 6300 drivers who walked out march 2 
over wages and job security agreed to the ceaseanddesist order 
if violent or harassing acts can be traced back to union 
leaders they will be subject to contempt of court charges and 
stiff fines 
specifically the nlrbs order prohibits union drivers from 
playing cat and mouse games with buses by shining lights at 
the vehicles or braking right in front of them 
throwing rocks concrete bricks bottles cans eggs coffee 
milk oil or transmission fluid at buses or replacement drivers 
spitting on replacement workers 
engaging in industrial sabotage such as breaking bus doors 
mirrors or windshield wipers throwing or setting off firebombs 
firecrackers and other devices at or near greyhound terminals or 
garages 
placing nails or glass in terminal driveways 
picketing in mass so as to block terminal driveways 
shouting vile epithets at strikebreakers or verbally 
threatening them or their families 
displaying signs with pictures of coffins or hangmens nooses 
aimed at intimidating replacement workers or brandishing baseball 
bats 
making shooting throatslashing or hanging motions at 
replacement workers

the prestigious british wine fraternity that 
honors topranking wine connoisseurs is extending its cachet to 
americans and other foreigners if they can pass a grueling 
fourday exam 
the institute of masters of wine a staid club of british wine 
merchants is actively soliciting foreign winemakers wine 
stewards teachers and others in the fermented grape business who 
aspire to use the coveted letters mw after their names 
nine out of 10 candidates fail the rigorous written exams and 
blind tastings but for the successful few mw is the wine worlds 
equivalent of academias phd 
the club has only 131 members and all but 14 of them are men 
we felt that we were becoming a rather introverted little 
club said executive director david stevens we would rather 
become an internationally recognized body with prestige weight 
and influence he said 
we took a very dramatic decision for us to throw open our 
doors to anyone in the world who could actually come and sit and 
pass this exam 
the first step was to open membership to eligible journalists 
and wine writers only one british wine writer and broadcaster 
jancis robinson has passed muster 
then foreigners including americans were allowed to take the 
exam so far no us palate has been admitted although eight 
americans took the annual exam in london last month stevens 
wouldnt give their names but said they included wine teachers 
wine wholesalers and retailers and sommeliers 
they will learn on july 17 whether they have joined the tiny 
group of foreigners in this unique professional body founded in 
1953 olivier humbrecht from the alsace region of france 
australian wine consultant michael hillsmith and winemaker michael 
brajkovich from the kumeu river winery in new zealand 
i think the examination is now much tougher than it used to 
be for the very simple reason that the wine industry has become 
far more complicated stevens said 
he passed on his first try in 1961 when basically if we knew 
about the wines of france germany a little bit about sherry 
port that was about it now you have to know about the wines of 
the world 
this years blind taste included wines from california 
australia new zealand spain and lebanon plus the produce of the 
more traditional wine regions of france germany and italy 
candidates had to identify the grapes from which the wine was 
made where they were grown and the wines vintage then they had 
to comment on how the wine was made and aged whenever possible 
the judges sneak in a bad wine to test their ability to detect 
imperfections 
stevens said he feels education standards have declined and 
that many potential masters of wine are unaccustomed to writing 
short essays required to test their knowledge of growing and 
harvesting grapes and the chemistry of winemaking 
i think that americans are not used to an examination where 
they have to express themselves in the written word he said 
they are much more used to answering multiplechoicetype 
questions a tick in the box to have to produce a very long 
reasoned written answer in written form they do find difficult 
the essay questions test knowledge of all aspects of the wine 
industry from planting and harvesting to winemaking chemistry 
storing and maturing bulk wine changing consumer tastes and the 
trend toward mergers and takeovers in the industry 
the openended questions range from are bubbles worth a 
premium to the chardonnay grape has been described as the 
perfect artists palette discuss and compare methods used in 
different wine regions to produce the various styles and how 
much should a wine reflect the personality and aims of the producer 
as opposed to the character of the vineyard

congressional democrats return to the budget 
bargaining table today unhappy with a 50 billion deficitreduction 
plan that the bush administration hopes will energize the stalled 
talks 
white house budget director richard darman made the proposal on 
wednesday the first to be advanced at the sixweekold budget 
summit 
the administration clearly presented this so we could start 
negotiations said sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking 
republican on the senate budget committee 
domenici said the plan will save 440 billion over the next five 
years he called it a good starting point in efforts to shrink 
a budget gap that administration and congressional experts believe 
is swelling beyond earlier expectations 
but democrats were not enthusiastic 
we have a good long way to go said their lead bargainer 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
democratic negotiators met privately following wednesdays 
negotiating session and called darmans proposal inadequate said a 
participant in the talks who asked not to be identified 
the plan was seen by some democrats as differing little from the 
37 billion in savings that president bush proposed in january in 
his fiscal 1991 budget 
bushs spending plan has been declared obsolete by democrats and 
republicans on capitol hill fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 just more 
than three months from now 
id compare darmans plan that to building a new room onto a 
house thats already collapsed said senate budget committee 
chairman james sasser dtenn 
according to officials involved in the talks the administration 
proposal relies on 20 billion in new taxes and other revenues 18 
billion in reductions in benefit programs such as medicare and 6 
billion in defense cuts 
it also includes 4 billion in domestic program reductions and 
2 billion saved by making lower than expected interest payments on 
the national debt 
the administration provided few details on where the savings 
would come participants said 
democrats say they believe at least 55 billion in savings are 
needed next year and 500 billion to 600 billion over the next 
five years 
the red ink grew again on wednesday 
darman told negotiators he now believes next years budget 
shortfall will be 159 billion unless action is taken if no action 
is taken 86 billion in cuts in most government programs would 
occur oct 1 under the grammrudman law that amount is considered 
intolerable by most lawmakers and white house officials 
grammrudman requires the president and congress to reduce next 
years budget gap to 64 billion if they miss that target by more 
than 10 billion the law imposes cuts in federal spending 
last month darman projected next years deficit at 138 billion 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated the 1991 
shortfall at 164 billion on wednesday 
all figures excluded the government cost of covering the 
collapse of the savings and loan industry those expenses could 
drive next years deficit to about 230 billion cbo and the white 
house agree

consumer groups hope electionyear politics 
will help them overcome insurance companies lobbying power and win 
congressional repeal of the industrys exemption from antitrust 
laws 
the house judiciary committee bolstered their effort wednesday 
approving 1917 a bill to subject insurance companies to federal 
antitrust lawsuits for the first time since 1945 
three of the committees 22 democrats reps dan glickman of 
kansas bruce morrison of connecticut and edward feighan of ohio 
voted with all 14 republicans in opposing it 
the bill would remove the industrys exemption from federal 
antitrust laws under the 1945 mccarrenferguson act which turned 
the regulation of insurance companies over to state governments 
policyholders who could show that states are not actively 
regulating the industry could sue insurance companies and their 
agents for pricefixing and other anticompetitive practices 
private individuals local governments and businesses of all 
sizes have found their premiums skyrocketing and their coverage 
severely restricted said rep jack brooks dtexas the 
committee chairman congress can no longer ignore the widespread 
economic dislocation caused by unreasonably high premiums or 
policies that are unavailable at any price 
in addition to pricefixing damages could be sought for the 
following anticompetitive practices 
allocating territories among competing companies 
monopolization 
forcing consumers to purchase insurance they dont want so they 
can buy the kind they do want an example is requiring the purchase 
of a homeowners policy in order to get auto insurance 
consumer groups seeking the legislation for the past 15 years 
acknowledged they face an uphill fight but they voiced optimism 
that the committee vote opens the way for a house floor fight that 
will draw public attention to the issue 
this represents an important breakthrough said robert 
brandon vice president of citizen action a grassroots consumer 
organization claiming 2 million members it demonstrates that an 
informed and aroused public can break the insurance industrys 
stranglehold over legislators 
linda lipsen legislative counsel for consumers union predicted 
the bill will become a major electionyear issue once it reaches 
the house floor 
behind food and shelter insurance is the single largest 
expenditure of the year for the average consumer she said 
just like the gun lobby the insurance lobby is no longer being 
perceived by congress as invincible 
the bill would allow insurance companies to continue sharing raw 
data on claims but after a fiveyear transition period it would 
greatly weaken companies reliance upon the insurance services 
office a new yorkbased industry organization that now advises 
what rates should be charged 
a similar bill was approved by the panels economic and 
commercial law subcommittee two years ago but died there under an 
intensive industry lobbying effort democrats said they hope to 
bring the new version to the full house in late summer or early 
fall 
although similar legislation has been introduced in the senate 
industry lobbyists say they are counting on sens dennis deconcini 
dariz and howell heflin dala both members of the senate 
judiciary committee to prevent it from reaching a floor vote there 
if this bill is enacted into law it may prove disastrous for 
consumers and small insurance companies alike said lowell beck 
president of the national association of independent insurers 
every litigated claim would subject to additional antitrust 
counts legal costs which by necessity would be passed on to 
consumers would soar 
lipsen disputed that claim citing a report by the general 
accounting office showing that workers compensation insurance 
rates fell by 30 percent in michigan after its legislature in 1982 
repealed a state antitrust exemption for such coverage

a former new york model whose face was slashed 
by razor blades says the stigma of victimization haunts her 
more than the actual memory of the attack four years ago 
in the scope of things those cuts to my face that night 
became almost insignificant except as a reference point marla 
hanson told the senate judiciary committee on wednesday 
the comment came at a hearing on legislation sponsored by 
committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel calling for tougher 
penalties for violence against women it would make genderrelated 
crimes a violation of civil rights entitling victims to sue for 
damages 
the bill also would 
double the minimum penalties for rape on federal property from 
six to 12 years and from nine to 18 years for rape that involves 
injury weapons or kidnapping a convicted rapist would have to pay 
his victim for medical psychological or rehabilitation costs and 
lost income 
provide 300 million in grants to combat genderrelated crimes 
create a national commission on violence against women 
the number of rapes has increased four times faster than total 
crime over the last decade according to committee figures a woman 
is beaten every 18 seconds and raped every six minutes the 
committee said 
the committee also heard from nancy ziegenmeyer a grinnell 
iowa woman who was abducted and raped in 1988 she said police 
treated her well but that prosecutors were overworked and she was 
hurt emotionally by an impersonal criminal justice system 
the crime against my body and my person became a crime against 
the state she said i became just a witness for the state of 
iowa and a case number it was a crime against the state it no 
longer was a crime against me 
ms hanson and mrs ziegenmeyer who testified in an effort to 
draw attention to the problem said they saw little that congress 
could do to cut down on such crimes but that women could be better 
treated by the system 
they called for advocates to ensure that victims understand the 
court process 
female victims often suffer harsh treatment in the court system 
said linda fairstein chief of the sex crimes prosecution unit in 
the manhattan district attorneys office 
i agree wholeheartedly with nancy and marla there is a true 
need within the system for advocates working with both the 
prosecutors and the victims she said 
ms hanson a 29yearold student at new york university 
underwent extensive plastic surgery to diminish the scars she 
suffered the attack occurred after ms hanson rebuffed advances 
from her landlord 
it seems in this society the term innocence implies some sort 
of guilt and nowhere is that attitude more apparent than in our 
current judicial system she said telling the committee that 
defense lawyers tried to make it seem that she was a woman of 
loose morals 
ms hansons landlord and two other assailants each were given 
the maximum five to 15year sentence mrs ziegenmeyers attacker 
was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole on 
firstdegree kidnapping charges

despite the suspension of us talks 
with the palestine liberation organization secretary of state 
james a baker iii says israel still needs the acquiescence of the 
plo to find a partner for peace talks 
baker whose recommendation for a suspension of the 18month 
dialogue was approved and announced by president bush on a 
political trip to alabama defended the decision even while 
admitting it would hurt moderate arabs 
we really could not let our pursuit of peace stand in the way 
of our commitment to fight terrorism baker said late wednesday 
en route to east berlin for talks on german unification 
a resort to terrorism would undermine any peace process that 
was unfolding baker said before a refueling stop here 
and yet he said the 18month dialogue that bush suspended over 
an aborted attack on tel aviv three weeks ago contributed the to 
us effort to get israelis to talk to palestinian arabs 
and baker said the suspension ordered by bush because plo 
chairman yasser arafat did not disavow the attack or punish the 
perpetrators could have an adverse impact on egypt and other 
moderates including some palestinians 
baker stressed they will keep trying to persuade israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs government to approve us terms for 
talks with palestinians 
we were not seeking a dialogue between israel and the plo 
baker said 
but he said everybody recognizes that without plo 
acquiescence there wont be a dialogue for israel they have been 
seeking to develop one for 22 years since the 1967 mideast war 
and none has come forward that points up the way in which this 
dialogue could contribute toward progress toward a peace process 
the last israeli government also headed by shamir refused to 
accept bakers formula for talks in march and then collapsed the 
new government formed by shamir has laid down even stiffer terms 
for talking to palestinians 
but senior us officials on bakers plane said the formula 
would not be changed were not prepared to embrace ideas that 
are nonstarters said one official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the us break with the plo long sought by israel could put 
pressure on shamir to go along with bakers formula which includes 
participation in the talks of palestinians deported from the west 
bank 
weve not got a formal answer to our question a us 
official said now if we get a no what is the reason for it 
ok

prosecutors have offered to release up to 6 
million from manuel noriegas frozen accounts to let him pay for 
his defense panamas new government immediately warned it will lay 
claim to the former dictators assets 
the deal wednesday with noriegas lawyers could end weeks of 
wrangling over 20 million frozen in accounts around the world 
after the us invasion of panama money the defense in the drug 
trafficking case said it needs to proceed 
the move also would avoid a showdown over potentially 
embarassing details of payments by the cia and other us 
intelligence agencies to the former panamanian leader 
this avoids distracting litigation and premature presentation 
of evidence that would only sidetrack us from the real issues 
said us attorney dexter lehtinen 
noriegas chief attorney frank rubino who had threatened make 
the cia payments public after the collapse of a previous compromise 
under which the government was to pay noriegas lawyers said he 
was happy with the new deal 
i think the american people should be thrilled that their 
taxes are not funding noriegas defense rubino said he denied 
the government was trying to avoid embarassment saying prosecutors 
simply wanted a good trial a fair trial 
however one potential roadblock for the deal was a 53 billion 
racketeering suit against noriega announced at the hearing 
wednesday on behalf of panama 
panamas attorney gregory craig said the lawsuit will allege 
murder grand theft and extortion by noriega he said it is being 
filed so that no irreparable damage be done to those funds that 
rightfully belong to the panamanian people 
but us district judge william hoeveler warned craig he will 
not let the lawsuit interfere with the criminal trial set to begin 
in january 1991 
under the arrangement to free some of noriegas assets the 
government will ask european nations that froze some of 27 noriega 
accounts at the request of the united states to release them to 
hoeveler some of the accounts were seized by other judicial 
districts in the united states and assistant us attorney michael 
sullivan said judges there and in europe will have to approve the 
deal 
rubino said the money is deposited in about half a dozen 
european countries 
under the agreement the total to be released will be between 
45 million and 6 million 
defense attorney steven kollin estimated the defense will cost 
5 million and said the government is prepared to spend close to 
40 million to convict noriega 
wednesdays deal was foreshadowed last week when the judge 
criticized the freezing of noriegas accounts the judge said the 
government must either prove that the money was drug profits as it 
claimed or release it to the defense 
noriegas lawyers had threatened to quit unless they got paid 
noriega who surrendered to us troops jan 4 is being held in 
the metropolitan correctional center outside of miami on charges of 
taking 46 million in bribes to protect the colombian cocaine 
trade 
in addition to the racketeering lawsuit two news photographers 
injured by us gunfire during the invasion of panama sued manuel 
noriega for 3 million on wednesday saying he is to blame for 
letting loose the dogs of war 
sygma photographer patrick chauvel of france was shot in the 
abdomen and reuters photographer malcolm linton of britain was shot 
in the leg on dec 15 outside a panama city hotel 
in the lawsuit they claim noriega is responsible for their 
injuries because he provoked the invasion

the food and drug administration has approved 
a new combination drug treatment that has been shown to prolong 
survival for patients with advanced stages of colon cancer 
the therapy combines levamisole a drug previously approved only 
for eliminating intestinal parasites in animals with fluorouracil 
already approved for treatment of several types of cancer 
fda officials said wednesday the combination of the two drugs in 
patients who have undergone surgery for colon cancer that has 
spread to nearby lymph nodes has been shown to reduce tumor 
reccurence and death in some patients 
colon cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is classified as 
stage 3 a category that applies to about 21000 of the 110000 
americans diagnosed with colon cancer each year about 40 percent 
live for five years or more after surgery the fda said 
the combination therapy was tested in two clinical trials 
sponsored by the national cancer institute that involved about 
1700 patients who had undergone surgery for stage 3 colon cancer 
researchers found that the treatment reduced the death rate for 
these patients by about onethird and the tumorrecurrence rate by 
about 40 percent 
they dont know however how the fiveyear survival rate will 
be affected since they have not followed these test patients that 
long yet said fda spokeswoman eva kemper

automakers and insurers disagree over 
copyright protection for product designs 
the auto industry urged congress on wednesday to approve 
legislation that would prohibit independent manufacturers from 
copying a parts original design for a decade after it first 
appears on the market 
the bills would protect consumers from shoddy imitation parts 
auto lobbyists told the house subcommittee on courts intellectual 
property and administration of justice 
imitation sheet metal parts are often of lesser quality in 
fit finish and durability said kenneth w myers of ford motor 
co 
he spoke on behalf of the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association which represents the big three us automakers 
opponents led by insurers said the legislation was designed to 
squelch competition in the lucrative replacement parts industry 
which generated 52 billion in sales in 1988 the price of parts 
will soar if the bills are passed they said 
american consumers will have to pay hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year in monopoly profits to auto manufacturers and 
they will get nothing in return said ca ingham vice president 
of state farm insurance co

british french and belgian museums

wednesday night 
mansell said the remains which included parts of eight bodies 
would be given to their original communities and finally laid to 
rest in burial ceremonies 
he said lobbying for other remains still in overseas museums 
would continue 
some institutions need prompting from the australian 
government it has to step behind us to stop our moves being 
frustrated he said 
mansell and the federation of aboriginal land councils had 
fought for five years to have the remains returned to communities

the worlds biggest convention on aids 
began under siege by thousands of angry demonstrators frustrated 
that many of them are likely to die of the disease before 
scientists learn to control it 
police said 80 demonstrators were arrested wednesday and 
speakers at the opening ceremonies in the evening repeatedly 
alluded to the protesters 
while conference participants were entertained by the san 
francisco gay mens chorus in the heavily guarded moscone center a 
crowd outside chanted were here were queer and we demand 
access 
about half the estimated 50000 gay men in san francisco are 
infected with the aids virus epidemiologists say 
the anger and frustration that surrounds this conference and 
pushes into it comes from seeing loved ones die mayor art agnos 
told the conference i know because i have gone through the same 
experiences and i am doing so now with people i love 
the sixth international conference on aids drew an estimated 
12000 researchers doctors social workers and other aids 
professionals along with 1800 reporters and thousands of 
activists 
more than 100 groups including the international planned 
parenthood foundation boycotted the meeting in opposition to an 
immigration policy that allows foreigners infected with the aids 
virus to be barred from the united states 
the conference organizers also oppose the us immigration 
policy in the strongest possible terms the conference chairman 
dr john l ziegler told the gathering 
while aids specialists generally sympathized with demonstrators 
frustration many resented disruptions like one that occurred at an 
aids pharmaceutical meeting earlier wednesday 
about a dozen members of the aids coalition to unleash power ran 
through shouting and tossing leaflets after a few minutes of 
arguing over an act up members attempt to seize the floor the 
invited speakers left and talked by closedcircuit tv from another 
room 
many doctors were upset 
they think that practicing physicians are the enemy this will 
hinder the exchange of useful information said dr john weiser 
of minneapolis 
dr june e osborn chairman of the national commission on aids 
cautioned that anger can be a powerful source of raw energy but 
it must be transformed into resolve in order to be useful 
in an effort to avert trouble peter staley an act up member 
from new york was invited to give one of the opening speeches 
he attempted to lead the delegates in an antibush 
administration chant using a conservative estimate of the worldwide 
aids toll 300000 dead from aids where is george few 
participated 
on my side the level of anger and frustration is reaching 
such a point that attitudes claiming that all of you are uncaring 
and in it for greed are now widespread staley said 
the magnitude of the challenge was clear in a report by the 
national academy of sciences about the likely course of the 
epidemic it said that while new infections appear to be leveling 
off in gay men the virus is spreading rapidly among crack smokers 
heavy drinkers women and teenagers 
we believe the picture of aids and hiv infection in the 
foreseeable future is one of a continuing toll of sickness and 
death for a steadily broadening profile of individuals said one 
of the authors dr don c des jarlais of mount sinai school of 
medicine in new york 
there were also reminders of sciences rapidly building 
understanding of aids and the human immunodeficiency virus 
at a symposium dr luc montagnier of the pasteur institute in 
paris suggested tiny bacteria called mycoplasma might work with 
hiv the aids virus to kill cells 
there are shortcomings in the idea that hiv causes all the 
signs of aids said montagnier a discoverer of the virus 
preliminary studies in his laboratory suggest treatment of aids 
patients with antiviral drugs in combination with drugs that attack 
mysoplasma might alleviate some of the worst symptoms of the 
disease 
dr jay a levy of the university of california at san francisco 
noted the recent discovery that white cells called suppressor cells 
make a protein that holds virusinfected cells in check 
identifying this substance should provide a new antiviral drug 
experiments in chimpanzees also show that a vaccine against hiv 
may be possible 
in this decade we have come a long way in our understanding 
of hiv infection and our direction now seems much better 
defined levy said where we are on the path to conquering 
aids however is still uncertain but we have begun to see the 
horizon and we will get there

honored to host the final performances of dame joan sutherland but 
watching the last show will be a costly proposition

australian operas performance of les huguenots in september 
will be the swan song of her 40year career

and a premium seat cost 390 us

die fledermaus was too hard on the legs a killer for her

time has not stopped the tears or shaken 
judy bradleys belief that a murderer ended her mothers life five 
years ago 
now new witnesses and an exhumation and autopsy have 
authorities reevaluating what they thought was the natural death 
of thelma lillian blodgett 
life itself had shown no signs of slowing the tiny graying 
spitfire known around the neighborhood as aunt tillie if she 
feared the exconvicts and rowdies around her apartment in south 
salt lake she didnt let on 
the 4foot11 woman often was in the thick of things upbraiding 
drug users refereeing a brawl or lending money to a neighbor 
pleading hard luck 
actually it scared a lot of us but my mother was feisty 
bradley said guys would fight in the parking lot and shed go 
out there and grab them by the ear and tell them to knock it off 
my mother could get scared but she wouldnt let anyone else 
know it she was feisty right up until the day she died 
she died on july 11 1985 bradley was convinced her mother did 
not go peacefully things were just not right she said 
a south salt lake police report indicates blodgett died in her 
bathroom in the afternoon finding no marks on the body or 
suspicious circumstances officers told bradley her 69yearold 
mother apparently had a heart attack 
i said im telling you right now somebody killed her i 
argued with all of them and believe me that house was full of 
police officers bradley said 
one of them detective sgt jim foster said police followed up 
when bradley phoned later that night to report some of her mothers 
belongings missing but a medical examiner concluded blodgett died 
of natural causes 
new evidence suggests bradley was right investigators say 
on june 11 blodgetts body was exhumed and an autopsy performed 
by a new medical examiner dr todd grey he changed the cause of 
death to undetermined and promised a further report in about a 
week from today 
investigators said the exhumation order was obtained after they 
talked with witnesses who had not previously come forward 
homicide cases are like that youll hit a brick wall then 
somebody decides to talk about it said jim bell chief 
investigator for the medical examiner 
investigators said their new information involves daniel troyer 
a utah state prison inmate awaiting trial on charges of murdering 
88yearold ethel luckau of salt lake city in 1988 
troyer who has a prior conviction for the rape and beating of a 
66yearold woman was questioned in 1988 about the deaths of four 
elderly woman including blodgett and luckau but police came up 
with few leads in all but the luckau case 
defense attorney james valdez insists his client had nothing to 
do with blodgetts death or the deaths of any of the other women 
police have questioned him about 
the problem is any time an elderly woman dies of suspicious 
circumstances theyre all the time automatically considering danny 
as a suspect he said 
the attorney did not know of any new evidence investigators may 
have against his client and police will not say 
the renewed interest came as a surprise to bradley 
tears still flow freely when she thinks of her mother as she 
has every day since that morning she met her for coffee left for a 
half hour and returned to find her body 
you relive it every day i know i want them to find her 
killer itll give me some relief but it wont make it easier 
she said 
her days are spent at home taking care of an old friend 
immobilized by a stroke the two get by on bradleys widows 
pension and his social security and veterans benefits the ordeal 
has drained her of energy and ambition at age 49 
but it hasnt quite snuffed the spark of the renegade who like 
tillie grew up fast ran wild as a teenager and married too 
many times 
they better find that guy because sooner or later i will if it 
takes the rest of my life she said

a popular folk singer deported back to his 
native taiwan for criticizing beijings crackdown on dissent says 
chinese officials gave him a choice prison or the return to taiwan 
i chose to leave hou dejian 34 was quoted as saying by 
the united daily news taiwan officials said hou had returned to 
taiwan on wednesday by fishing boat and that he was being 
questioned by authorities 
hou defected from taiwan in 1983 saying he needed to seek his 
roots liu pengchun deputy director of the exit and entry bureau 
said the singer would be allowed to resettle in taiwan because he 
was fleeing political suppression 
hou and two other dissidents disappeared in beijing on may 31 
just hours before they were to issue an open letter to chinese 
leaders calling for the release of political prisoners 
the other two university newspaper editor gao xin and former 
university lecturer zhou duo resurfaced earlier this week in 
beijing with gao saying he spent the two weeks vacationing 
under police supervision 
in an interview with the united daily news hou said he was 
deported by chinese authorities after being detained 10 days in 
beijing for his public criticism of the bloody crackdown of the 
prodemocracy movement last year that left hundreds of civilians 
dead 
i had tried to persuade them chinese officials into 
accepting good reasoning and accepting dissidents who held 
different opinions hou said my efforts were a complete 
failure 
he said he was placed on a patrol boat in the southern chinese 
port of fuzhou on monday and transferred to a taiwanese fishing 
vessel that brought him back to the offshore island 
hous father was soldier and one of the 2 million followers of 
the nationalist government who retreated to taiwan in 1949 after 
losing a civil war to communist forces on the chinese mainland 
hou was a commercially established singer before during a 1983 
visit to the communist mainland he decided to stay 
the darling of the government he was allowed to keep living 
like a star with two homes and two cars one a maroon mercedes 
benz 
the skinny chainsmoking hou is famous among chinese on the 
mainland taiwan and hong kong for his bob dylaninfluenced songs 
about social concerns such as the endangered pandas and about the 
worries of youth but he became known to westerners when in the 
final days of chinas student democracy movement he and three 
friends began a hunger strike in tiananmen square to protest 
martial law 
many students were already leaving the square out of fear and 
the hunger strike infused the movement with new spirit 
when troops were called in to crush the prodemocracy movement 
on june 34 the four negotiated safe passage out of besieged 
tiananmen square for the few thousand remaining student protesters 
hou then hid in the australian embassy in beijing for more than 
two months until the chinese government promised he would not be 
arrested after he left the embassy he was one of the few chinese 
to continue to publicly call for democratic reform

a new species of monkey with a lions head and a 
striking gold and black coat has been discovered in an unlikely 
place a highly urbanized part of brazil scientists say 
the blackfaced lion tamarin as the new monkey is called is a 
golden squirrelsized monkey with black face forearms and tail 
and a big bushy mane it was discovered this spring researchers 
said wednesday 
its quite remarkable because its almost like finding 
something in the suburbs of los angeles said russell 
mittermeier president of conservation international in washington 
it is only the fourth species of lion tamarin known it will be 
the highlight of a meeting on lion tamarins to be held in brazil 
beginning today 
the discovery of the monkey complicates conservationists jobs 
because we have to be concerned with another species in another 
habitat said charles snowdon a zoologist and psychologist at 
the university of wisconsin 
on the other hand he said it may be important for getting 
better ideas about how to conserve all species of lion tamarins 
the new lion tamarin was found by two biology students who had 
just taken their first jobs as professors lucia lorini and vanessa 
guerra persson they were collaborating with dante martins teixera 
of the national museum in rio de janeiro 
the discovery is biologically important and an important 
conservation challenge as well said benjamin beck associate 
director of the national zoo in washington further studies of the 
animals habitat and their relation to other lion tamarins should 
be conducted soon he said 
when mittermeier learned of the discovery he immediately 
committed 30000 toward such studies and toward protection of this 
highly endangered new species 
the blackfaced lion taarin was discovered on the island of 
superagui south of the city of sao paulo in the brazilian state 
of parana parana is one of brazils most developed areas with 
only 3 percent of its original forest cover remaining mittermeier 
said 
part of the island is a national park mittermeier said but the 
blackfaced lion tamarin was found only in another part of the 
island he said 
preliminary surveys suggest that only a few dozen of the 
blackfaced lion tamarins have survived mittermeier said 
three other species of lion tamarins are known the most famous 
of them the goldenlion tamarin which has been bred in captivity 
at the national zoo and elsewhere around the world it has been 
reintroduced into a reserve in brazil 
all are members of the genus leontopithecus the new lion 
tamarin was named leontopithecus caissara after the coastal 
fishermen or caicaras who live and work on the island where it 
was found 
all of the lion tamarins are endangered primarily because the 
coastal atlantic forest of brazil their sole habitat has nearly 
disappeared under the crush of a burgeoning human population 
researchers must find out exactly how many blackfaced lion 
tamarins remain exactly where and how they live what they eat and 
what other animals live in the same places beck said

a 4000yearold temple believed to honor a 
goddess of healing is being unearthed in iraq and may shed light on 
ancient medicine and other aspects of life in babylonian times 
archeologists say 
digging began in january on the relatively untouched structure 
in nippur nippur was the religious heart of mesopotamia and the 
site of many temples but archeologists said they were surprised by 
the size of this temple 
diggers have only uncovered about a sixth of the temples 
foundation estimated to be 100 yards long and 40 yards wide and 
already they have discovered baked clay figurines in the shapes of 
humans and dogs 
the temple believed to honor the goddess gula may shed light 
on babylonian politics economics medicine and social structure 
said mcguire gibson archaeology professor at the university of 
chicagos oriental institute 
we really still dont understand a lot about mesopotamian 
culture he said wednesday 
mesopotamia the area between the tigris and euphrates rivers in 
what is now iraq and syria was the site of several ancient 
civilizations beginning some 8000 years ago 
much of what is known about those times comes from clay tablets 
the equivalent of modernday letters remnants of other temples in 
nippur and elsewhere have been examined piecemeal and have often 
been disturbed by diggers who have removed important artifacts 
archaeologists say 
findings from the dig could supplement information from clay 
tablets and show not what people say they did but what they 
actually did said harvey weiss an archaeology professor at yale 
university who was not involved in the dig 
gibson and his colleagues hope to find new insights into 
babylonian medicine one figurine shows a man clutching his 
throat another shows a man holding his stomach he said 
theyre obviously showing gula where it hurts 
the dog figurines may have been left to honor the goddess since 
dogs were associated with gula gibson said 
there was a highly developed system of health care during the 
period in which the temple existed doctors prescribed herbs when 
the herbs didnt work magicians performed exorcisms or other 
spiritual intercession but that information is based largely on 
information from clay tablets said william biggs a university of 
chicago professor who studies such tablets 
the best possible discovery would be an archive of medical 
texts which might have been stored in the temple biggs said 
that would be tremendously important because most of the medical 
texts we have are from 800 years later he said 
gibson said he first found a corner of the temple in 1973 but 
shifting sands prevented excavation 
digging is at a lull during the hot summer months but gibson 
said he will return to the site in january archaeologists from the 
oriental institute have been digging in nippur for 40 years under 
an agreement with iraq gibson said

delivery boys and wall streeters mothers and 
grandmothers blacks and whites they mixed and cheered together 
during nelson mandelas historic visit to their city 
the south african freedom fighter who spent 27 years behind bars 
in his struggle against apartheid stepped off a plane wednesday and 
into a heros welcome 
ticker tape cascaded onto his bulletproof mandelamobile 
during a parade up broadway students at a brooklyn high school 
shouted mandela mandela he got the key to the city 
mandela made people laugh and made them weep he smiled and 
waved and enchanted the politicians along with the throngs 
nelson i named my son after you shouted a tearful uhuru 
williams of rochester accompanied by the 3yearold boy at city 
hall 
the 71yearold mandela smiled at her from the stage 
there are few really great heroes left said martin 
mcdonnough of suburban new york city this is not a nixon or a 
bush but someone who was in jail 28 years of his life and suffered 
and stood up for his beliefs 
just look around its whiteblackwhiteblackwhiteblack 
businessman tom kellerhals said of the parade crowd sometimes 
the answer is in front of us 
in brooklyn students at boys and girls high school shouted as 
mandela arrived in a motorcade after landing at kennedy airport 
at the parade the emotional peak of mandelas first day in the 
united states derrick fuller shouted the greatest freedom 
fighter ever as mandela and his wife winnie passed by in the 
flatbed truck outfitted with a glass bubble 
riding with the mandelas were gov mario cuomo and mayor david 
dinkins 
fathers hoisted sons on their shoulders and women thrust forward 
uncomprehending babies as if they were cameras 
leslie anderson of plainfield nj took the day off to see the 
man she called a legend i was too young to see martin luther 
king and malcolm x hes the last of the great black heroes she 
said 
we dont live in apartheid but its here its real she 
added new york is a prime example think of bensonhurst where 
a black teenager was murdered by a white mob last year 
standing a few feet away was fred marks a white businessman who 
also had come out to see mandela 
i think any man who spent 27 years in jail deserves a look 
he said 
a father and son guitar duo sat under a tree nearby playing the 
blues 
me and my father wrote a little something about mandela and 
dinkins meeting about the mandelas in new york said ted 
williams jr its happy its nice you can do the chicken dance 
to it 
many who skipped work to see mandela declined to be interviewed 
for the record but one man agreed to appear on television asked 
what he would tell his boss if he was spotted he said im gonna 
say two words nelson mandela 
sean smith a foreign currency options broker saw irony in the 
parades location this is the biggest laughable thing that ever 
happened he said that wall street supported apartheid and 
turned around and threw a tickertape parade 
not everyone was impressed with the visit wayne moore squatted 
as he shined the shoes of a welldressed man at a broadway corner 
shine em up he yelled as he buffed shine em up 
i heard mandela was coming down today so thered be a big 
crowd and id make more money moore said do i think he could

a senior plo official said today that the 
us suspension of its dialogue with the group struck a blow to 
peace efforts and will encourage israel to come down harder on the 
palestinian uprising 
suleiman najab a member of the plos ruling executive 
committee described the move by president bush on wednesday as a 
flagrant defiance of the palestinians arabs and world peace 
in jerusalem an aide to rightwing prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said wednesday that the us decision removed a major 
obstacle to peace 
bush said he suspended the 18monthold dialogue because the 
palestine liberation organization failed to forcefully condemn an 
unsuccessful may 30 terrorist attack against israel 
the dialogue began after plo chairman yasser arafat renounced 
terrorism and accepted israels right to exist 
bush had urged arafat to disavow the assault and to discipline 
the plo faction that sent two speedboats filled with fighters 
toward a tel aviv beach the boats were intercepted by israel and 
four guerrillas killed and 12 captured 
najab said in an interview in baghdad iraq that bushs 
decision will encourage israel to commit more crimes and 
massacres against our people in the occupied territories 
the plo official spoke this morning after a predawn meeting of 
the 15member executive committee najab and other committee 
members were in baghdad for a meeting on recent developments in the 
palestinian issue and to discuss the recent formation of the new 
rightwing israeli cabinet 
in tunis salah khalaf regarded as the plos secondincommand 
was quoted wednesday by the french news agency agence francepresse 
as saying bushs move would freeze peace efforts and reinforce 
extremist forces in the middle east 
jamil hilal who heads the plo information department said in a 
telephone interview from tunis where the plo has its headquarters 
that the suspension of the dialogue can be judged only as an 
unfriendly and colonial move its a blow to the peace process 
and a provocation to arab states 
hilal said he expects the plo in retaliation for the suspension 
of talks to call on arab nations to apply economic sanctions 
against the united states i expect the uprising in the occupied 
territories to escalate 
avi pazner a top aide to shamir praised bushs decision to end 
the dialogue 
its an important and positive decision as far as the peace 
process in the area is concerned he said in jerusalem the plo 
was a major obstacle to peace and now that obstacle is removed 
in the occupied west bank jamil tarifi a proplo palestinian 
leader who has been named as a possible peace negotiator condemned 
the us move 
anyone who wants to talk to the palestinians must talk with 
the plo he added

fortyfour redwood summer demonstrators 
were arrested at a lumber mill in a protest against logging 
practices they say endanger californias old forests 
about 350 took part in the protest at louisiana pacific on 
wednesday the first day of a summerlong series of demonstrations 
by environmentalists who have come to california from around the 
country 
the demonstrations are modeled on the freedom summer of 1964 
during which civil rights activists converged on mississippi 
many of those arrested wednesday marched onto company property 
and approached officers so they could be taken into custody deputy 
sheriff leona mendenhall said most were issued citations for 
trespassing and released 
the rally was organized by earth first which is known for 
tactics such as standing between loggers and trees the group 
renounced its practice of driving spikes into trees to make them 
useless as lumber after sawmill workers were injured by broken saws 
mainstream environmental groups including the sierra club have 
refused to take part in redwood summer and have disavowed the 
tactics of earth first 
redwood summer organizers are demanding an end to what they say 
is excessive clearcut logging and cutting of virgin redwood trees 
the demonstration was largely peaceful with only sporadic 
namecalling from passing motorists and between protesters and 
lumber mill employees 
weve got to save whats left of the forests said david 
solnit 26 a carpenter from san francisco they louisiana 
pacific are acting like outlaws and we need to take direct 
action 
duane plant a lumber worker who carried a sign denouncing 
environmental terrorists said that the louisiana pacific had 
engaged in proper cutting techniques and that the protesters didnt 
understand how the industry works 
samoa is about 275 miles north of san francisco 
in sierra county about 250 miles southeast of samoa in the 
sierra nevada sheriff lee adams said two sacramento men were 
arrested after reports of shooting near a logging site near 
downieville 
no one was hit adams said investigators were trying to 
determine if the shots were an attempt to halt the logging he said 
the two men were apparently not involved with any antilogging 
organization

secretary of state james a baker iii headed 
for backtoback talks today with the foreign ministers of the two 
germanys to go over military and legal questions raised by 
impending unification 
on bakers agenda was a proposal by west germany and france to 
provide economic aid to the soviet economy 
the help is designed to assist soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev in his perestroika program with the hope the kremlin 
leader would drop his objections to nato membership for a united 
germany 
but a senior us official said the bush administration had not 
decided whether to support the proposal whose details were not 
immediately available he said there was a distinct possibility 
that the united states would not take part 
the west german government several months ago took the lead in 
offering to help gorbachev cope with his economic woes 
the bonnbased newspaper die welt reported today that west 
germany plans to give moscow more than 3 billion in credit to 
support development of an open market 
bakers separate meetings with foreign ministers markus meckel 
of east germany and hansdietrich genscher of west germany were to 
deal with the nato issue and also procedures for the big four 
allies of world ii the united states the soviet union britain 
and france to relinquish their control of berlin 
baker who arrived in berlin on this morning also will meet 
separately with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on 
friday 
he is in berlin for two days of twoplusfour talks that 
bring together the four victors of world war ii and the two 
germanys who are set to merge their economies july 2 and may hold 
allgerman elections in december 
french president francois mitterrand said tuesday he would ask 
the united states and five other major industrial democracies to 
consider extending financial and technical aid to the soviets at an 
economic summit in houston next month 
baker officials said also was weighing other assurances to 
allay moscows concerns over a united germanys membership in nato 
officials said those assurances included issuance of 
declarations by nato and the sovietled warsaw pact designed to 
reflect the lowering of eastwest tensions and the prospective 
withdrawal of tens of thousands of us and soviet troops from 
europe 
gorbachevs economic problems are apt to be compounded when east 
germany is absorbed by west germany there are an estimated 380000 
soviet troops in east germany some would stay for a transitional 
period under a us proposal baker took up with shevardnadze in 
copenhagen 
but the soviets would be limited to no more than 195000 
soldiers in all of central europe including what is now east 
germany under a treaty being negotiated in vienna by nato and the 
warsaw pact 
the return of the troops would strain the soviet budget both in 
terms of housing them and finding jobs for those mustered out of 
the service as part of a cutback of 500000 men promised by 
gorbachev in december 1988

cabinet ministers hope to reverse a decision 
delaying construction of a voice of america radio relay station for 
a twoyear study of bird migration communications officials said 
today 
the national planning board voted tuesday to commission the 
study of bird migration patterns before making a final decision on 
the 300 million project the relay station designed to transmit 
voa broadcasts to eastern europe and africa would be located in 
the arava desert area on the southeastern tip of israel 
twice a year large numbers of birds fly over the arava in their 
trips back and forth between africa and the northern hemisphere 
israeli environmentalists opposing the voa transmitter say it would 
disturb the migrating birds 
the united states and israel signed an agreement in 1987 to 
build the transmitter for the us governmentrun voice of america 
the project is expected to create hundreds of jobs and give an 
economic boost to the sparsely populated arava area 
us officials expressed disappointed by the decision to delay 
construction 
the issue of possible damage to migrating birds from 
shortwave transmitters has been wellstudied a us embassy

tamil rebels launched heavy attacks on 
northern military installations today and the government rushed in 
reinforcements for what could be a decisive battle in sri lankas 
civil war 
more than 1400 combatants have been killed since the separatist 
conflict in the countrys north and east exploded into fullscale 
war again 10 days ago the government said no figures were given 
for civilian casualties also believed to be high 
additional soldiers were sent by air and sea to the northern 
city of jaffna to bolster defenses at two naval bases a military 
airfield and an army garrison said deputy defense minister ranjan 
wijeratne he refused to give figures 
tamil tiger rebels today attacked the bases airfield and 
garrison with rocketpropelled grenades automatic weapons and 
suicide squads of guerrillas carrying explosives tamil sources 
said on condition of anonymity 
the sources said the militants were mustering men and weapons 
for an allout onslaught on jaffna fort where the largest military 
garrison in the region is located 
jaffna a rebel stronghold is on the northern tip of this 
island nation and 200 miles north of the capital colombo 
the government claimed to have recaptured all major towns in the 
east this week 
right now we have liberated the entire eastern province which 
includes the districts of ampara batticaloa and trincomalee 
minister wijeratne told reporters in colombo 
he said that despite the fighting the government is determined 
to go ahead with political moves to grant greater political and 
administrative autonomy to the tamil minority in the north and east 
we regard the fighting as a minor aberration the political 
process will go on wijeratne said 
the government appealed to foreign governments for urgent 
medical assistance 
government forces under orders to crush the rebels wherever 
they exist were using helicopter gunships and bombing runs by 
ground support planes to defend the northern bases military 
officials said 
the 200yearold dutch fort in jaffna has been under severe 
pressure from the dominant tamil tiger rebels since fighting broke 
out between the rebels and government troops on june 11 
the defense ministry says several attacks on the fort have been 
repulsed about 150 troops and police defend the 55acre stronghold 
the latest round of fighting broke out june 11 after a tamil 
resident in the eastern town of batticaloa complained he had been 
manhandled by sinhalese police tamil tigers then overran a police 
station and combat escalated from there 
sri lankas tamils make up 18 percent of the countrys 16 
million people the sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population 
military officials including defense secretary gen cyril 
ranatunge said that since june 11 800 rebels 278 policemen and 
219 troops have been killed they did not say where or when the 
deaths occurred in addition at least 500 policemen who 
surrendered to the rebels are missing 
officials say civilian casualty figures are unknown but also 
high since the military relied on air attacks to neutralize rebel 
positions in populated cities in the north and east 
rebel statements issued by their london office claim that more 
than 100000 tamils and moslems have fled their homes in the region 
this month 
the tamil rebels are fighting for autonomy in the northern and 
eastern portion of the indian ocean island nation the mainly hindu 
tamils say they are discriminated against by the buddhist sinhalese 
majority 
the rebels had taken control of most major towns of the region 
after indian troops trying to enforce a peace agreement withdrew in 
march the pullout made at the request of president ranasinghe 
premadasa followed the indians unsuccessful 32month attempt to 
disarm the tamil tigers 
at least 11000 people have been killed since tamil militants 
began fighting for an independent nation in 1983 in 1987 india 
brokered a peace accord between the two sides and sent a force to 
disarm the rebels fighting ensued and the indian troops were 
withdrawn in march of this year

french judges barred by law from striking 
postponed trials and staged protests across france today in an 
unprecedented walkout organized to demand more autonomy and better 
working conditions 
the day of national action marked the first coordinated 
protest by french judges on behalf of their profession a majority 
of the 6000 judges participated and only urgent criminal cases 
were heard in several cities 
the judges say the judiciary has been degraded by inadequate 
facilities budget restrictions and an excessive workload 
the three unions of judges usually divided by political 
differences all supported the oneday protest one of them the 
leftwing syndicat de la magistrature called on members to strike 
in defiance of a 1958 statute while the moderate and rightist 
unions advised members to find some legal way of expressing 
discontent 
in paris and other major cities judges abandoned their chambers 
to attend union rallies 
justice for the courts of justice read a banner at a 
protest attended by robed judges in strasbourg 
union leaders contend that the workload for judges has increased 
steadily even though france now has fewer judges for its 56 million 
people than in 1914 when the population of 39 million was served 
by 6600 judges 
the unions also have demanded statutory reforms to lessen 
executive branch control over the judiciary also they have 
complained about a governmentbacked amnesty law which requires 
judges to drop charges against various politicians involved in 
alleged fundraising scandals 
the protests took place despite an appeal wednesday from justice 
minister pierre arpaillange who asked that court operations not be 
disrupted he promised that the government would adopt a major 
courthouse construction and renovation program to start by next 
year 
michael joubrel president of the moderate union syndicale des 
magistrates said the protest was not aimed at the justice ministry 
its not the courts that will be held hostage but the 
ministry of finance which possesses the means of improving 
justice he said 
although the protesting judges contend that the government 
should allocate more on the court system it now gives 136 
percent of the national budget they are not specifically 
demanding a pay raise most judges currently earn the equivalent of 
between 30000 and 60000 annually 
the only previous coordinated protests by judges according to 
french newspapers were organized to denounce disciplinary actions 
taken against colleagues

final results of last months election 
in burma will be delayed because bad weather has hampered access to 
remote areas burmese state radio said 
official results through wednesday show the opposition national 
league for democracy taking 396 of the 485 seats in the national 
assembly 
the may 27 poll was the first multiparty election in three 
decades some western diplomats in rangoon have said the military 
government may be intentionally delaying the final results because 
of a reluctance to hand over power 
the government said before the election that it would take up to 
three weeks for the final results 
rangoon radio on wednesday broadcast a statement issued by the 
elections commission saying it was awaiting results from five 
remote constituencies in the far northern states of sagaing and 
kachin a transcript of the broadcast was seen in bangkok today 
although efforts have been made to obtain reports about the 
elections from those townships with the help of military 
helicopters weather conditions have so far prevented the trips 
the commissions statement said 
it said messengers had been sent by land but there have been 
delays because of mudslides on mountain roads and because some 
bridges have been washed away 
as soon as they are obtained the commission will resume 
announcing the names of the candidates elected it said 
the statement did not say how long that would take 
foreign diplomats said the polling appeared to have been 
conducted fairly but was preceded by the detention of thousands of 
dissidents 
many burmese distrust the military government soldiers killed 
thousands of people demanding democracy in 1988

scientists today said an apelike creature that 
lived 10 million years ago may be the earliest known direct 
ancestor of humans 
the claim met sharp skepticism from experts who said they were 
unconvinced by the researchers anatomical analysis of a remnant of 
the creatures skull 
i dont believe for a minute that the beast is a direct 
human ancestor peter andrews of the natural history museum in 
london said wednesday in a telephone interview 
the analysis also implies that ancestors of humans may have 
started evolving away from ancestors of chimps and gorillas 
millions of years earlier than many scientists believe 
it is presented in the british journal nature by l de bonis of 
the university of poitiers in france g bouvrain and d geraads of 
the university of paris and g koufos of the university of 
thessaloniki in greece 
the fossil found last september in greece is thought to be 9 
million to 10 million years old it represents a previously known 
animal called ouranopithecus macedoniensis 
the fossil includes the right part and a portion of the left 
part of an adults face plus the upper jaw with most of the teeth 
the researchers said 
they said the fossils anatomy suggests that ouranopithecus 
macedoniensis appeared on the human branch of the evolutionary tree 
after that lineage split from the ancestors of gibbons orangutans 
gorillas and chimpanzees 
that would make it a direct ancestor of humans 
the researchers also suggested that the human lineage may have 
started evolving away from the ancestors of chimps and gorillas as 
long as 12 million years ago 
other scientists have put that split at 5 million to 7 million 
years ago said lawrence martin assistant professor in 
antholopology at the state university of new york at stony brook 
martin who has studied other fossils from ouranopithecus 
macedoniensis said he is absolutely sure the new study is 
wrong in assigning the beast to the human lineage 
martin said he puts the beast further back in evolution before 
the human lineage started evolving away from ancestors of 
chimpanzees and gorillas

house republicans kept the house in session 
all through the night just like a telethon to talk about 
drugs and tough punishment for users and other proposals for 
combatting crime in america 
the speeches began at 715 pm wednesday and continued until 
after 8 am as member after member took the lectern to address a 
nearlyempty house chamber but television cameras broadcast the 
session to a nationwide audience over cspan the congressional 
cable channel 
one participant rep robert livingston of louisiana described 
the allnight session as being just like a telethon 
indeed some of the members propped before them a poster with 
the handlettered words crime watch and a telephone number for 
americans to call as the night wore on to report crimes in their 
cities 
that number again is 2022243121 was heard more than once 
as members urged watchers to call 
before it started speaker thomas foley dwash called the 
session total nonsense and a politically motivated activity 
because we are going to pass a major crime bill this year 
there was no indication how many people called or how many were 
watching the allnight show which began after the house had 
concluded the days regular legislative business 
shortly after 2 am rep jack fields of texas was agreeing 
with several earlier speakers that more jail cells for drug users 
was the answer and said they should be uncomfortable places that 
are hot in summer and cold in winter 
he said mosquitoinfested regions of texas and louisiana would 
be good places for prisons and that inmates should not be given 
insect repellent he also said it might be a good idea for them to 
be housed in tents tents with holes in them 
rep jim mccrery of louisiana said cocaine is sometimes smuggled 
across the mexican border concealed in red cans purported to 
contain tomatoes 
the chief threat to our security in the 1990s may well come 
from hordes of red tomato cans rather than hordes of red 
communists he said 
rep susan molinari of new york criticized gov mario cuomo for 
opposing the death penalty at 6 am sounding like a telethon 
host she announced we now shift coasts and turned the 
program over to rep dana rohrabacher of california 
the no 2 house republican rep newt gingrich of georgia went 
live on nbcs today at 709 for a network finale 
im glad the speaker made the commitment that he is 
willing to bring up the bill gingrich said on today 
so maybe we have made some progress during the night but we 
are determined if necessary to do this again in july or august to 
continue to make the point that the democratic leadership after a 
year of holding up the presidents crime and drug package owes it 
to the american people to bring it to the floor of the house 
gingrich said 
in an apparent preemptive response to the republicans 
talkathon house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks dtexas 
announced in advance that comprehensive anticrime legislation will 
be considered next week by the panels subcommittee on crime 
the crime bill would expand use of the death penalty for federal 
crimes including presidential assassination strengthen controls 
over chemicals needed to manufacture certain drugs and toughen 
criminal sanctions on those distributing anabolic steroids

in punishing the palestine liberation 
organization for violence the united states may have opened the 
door to even more violence even president bush recognized that 
irony when he announced his decision to suspend the 18month us 
dialogue with the plo 
bush said wednesday the united states must respond to the plos 
violation of its pledge to renounce terrorism the magic words 
that led the reagan administration in its waning days to lift a 
13year ban on direct talks with the plo 
and bush promised that as soon as the plo condemns the thwarted 
may 30 attack by plo guerrillas on israels coast the united 
states will resume the talks 
nonetheless analysts agree the suspension of the talks has 
badly damaged the tentative results of the lowlevel dialogue 
conducted in virtual secrecy in tunis where the plo has its 
headquarters 
this will make the radicals and all those who oppose peace 
strong said faisal husseini one of the leading palestinian 
nationalists in the israelioccupied west bank 
assistant secretary of state john kelly told a house panel 
wednesday that cutting off dialogue with the plo will harm the 
middle east peace process adding it may herald a period of time 
in which there is more violence and more terrorism 
bush asked whether he was worried about playing into the hands 
of plo hardliners said yes i am concerned about that and 
secretary of state james a baker iii who recommended the 
suspension acknowledged it would hurt moderate arabs 
the president said he recognized the frustration among 
palestinians at the slow pace of the dialogue but he cited 
achievements 
on balance we believe that these exchanges contributed to 
progress in the peace process he said in announcing his 
decision i think things are better because weve had the 
dialogue 
analysts say the dialogue proved to americans that the plo was 
the only representative of the palestinian people and therefore 
vital to the success of arabisraeli peace talks us influence 
also got the plo to accept negotiations with its archenemy israel 
we were just starting to drive the demons out of each others 
eyes said richard murphy the leading mideast official in the 
reagan administration 
for palestinians long shunned in the west as terrorists bent on 
the destruction of israel the dialogue provided a modicum of 
legitimacy 
and it showed palestinians that us foreign policy was not 
warped by its support for the jewish state murphy said in an 
interview 
us officials said last summer they were closer to arranging 
talks between israel and the palestinians than ever before 
the plan advanced by baker would have brought together israeli 
officials and palestinians whose participation was approved by the 
plo 
the talks to be held in cairo would have set up elections 
among the 17 million palestinians under israeli occupation 
for the mainstream of the plo which includes some factions 
radically opposed to the dialogue with israel the acceptance of 
talks with israel was a major concession 
we lose sight of the fact that arafat did something we 
predicted no palestinian would do bush said 
but israel balked at accepting some of the proposed palestinian 
negotiators because of their antiisrael activity 
the united states appealed for help last summer from egypt the 
only arab country which has made peace with israel 
besides advancing the peace process the other us objective in 
the dialogue was to bring about an end to plo terrorism us 
ambassador robert pelletreau often would bring up suspected 
terrorist incidents with a plo official named hakam balaoui and 
ask for explanations 
the state department cited results reporting to congress that 
while 30 border and rocket attacks were launched by palestinian 
groups against israel since december 1988 there was no evidence 
any were authorized by the plo executive committee 
but ultimately the suspension of the dialogue was prompted by 
the very obstacle that prevented direct talks with the plo since 
its inception in 1964 terrorism

east germany today overwhelmingly 
approved a treaty merging its economy with west germanys marking 
the biggest and most difficult step toward unification and the end 
of 40 years of socialism 
the vote in the east german parliament for the historic treaty 
was 30282 with one abstension 
earlier in the day east german lawmakers declared a united 
germany would not seek to reclaim former lands ceded to poland 
after world war ii 
west german chancellor helmut kohl urged lawmakers in his 
country to also pass the economic treaty and to promise that 
polands borders were secure 
the actions came as the parliaments of the two german states met 
simultaneously in their respective capitals to take final action on 
the treaty merging the economies of the germanys by july 2 
the treaty comes after months of work at breakneck speed 
following the collapse late last year of east germanys communist 
government and the fall of the berlin wall east germany elected a 
noncommunist government in march headed by prime minister lothar 
de maiziere 
on july 2 the powerful west german mark becomes the official 
tender for both countries and east germany moves toward a 
freemarket economy 
political unification is now seen as a possibility before years 
end 
under the treaty economic union will be based on a freemarket 
economy including private property competition and full freedom 
for workers the west german bundesbank or central bank will have 
responsibility for all monetary policy 
wages salaries and pensions will be converted to west german 
marks at a 11 exchange rate 
all other savings will be converted at two east german marks for 
one west german mark debts will also be converted at a 21 rate 
which is more favorable to troubled east german companies 
in bonn kohl opened a scheduled 13hour debate on the economic 
treaty 
the treaty shows the way to german unity and whoever doesnt 
follow this road sign doesnt want unity kohl said 
leftist opposition forces in west germany say kohl is rushing 
too quickly with german unification 
kohl on monday said 1990 would be the year of german unity 
and his christian democratic party has called for united german 
elections in early december 
the opposition social democrats insist that the economic treaty 
fails to go far enough in supporting east german businesses which 
will be hardpressed to compete with west german companies 
some experts have predicted up to 2 million unemployed in east 
germany as outmoded governmentowned factories and businesses try 
to compete more than a third of the enterprises are expected to 
close and there are fears social unrest could result 
six members of the 400member east german parliament voted 
against the guarantee of polands borders and 18 abstained 
the resolution urged poland to guarantee the rights and culture 
of millions of ethnic germans living in poland a third of 
presentday poland was once german territory 
lawmakers from the archconservative german social union sought 
a stronger resolution demanding that ethnic germans in poland have 
cultural independence and their own schools 
in bonn kohl strongly urged passage of the declaration 
recognizing polands western border although he acknowledged that 
the move was painful for some germans 
up until a few months ago there was widespread international 
concern that germany would try to regain some of the lands ceded to 
poland after the war 
the germanpolish border is final foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher told lawmakers 
still to be decided is the strategic future of a united germany 
the four world war ii allies that divided the country the united 
states soviet union britain and france are to hold a round of 
unification talks in east berlin on friday

prime minister yitzhak shamir today urged the 
united states to permanently end its dialogue with the plo and 
palestinians chanted antiamerican slogans to protest president 
bushs suspension of the talks 
israeli newspapers said bushs action wednesday could mean more 
american pressure on israel to forge a new peace strategy 
in nablus the occupied west banks largest city dozens of 
palestinians marched though the crowded market area chanting no 
to america no to israel yes to the plo 
at least one of the marchers carried a pistol and others covered 
their faces with checked palestinian kefiyyeh scarves one witness 
said 
an antiamerican march also was reported in the west bank town 
of tulkarem 
in arab east jerusalems silwan section a palestinian man was 
killed when police opened fire wednesday night on youths who 
blocked streets with stones as news of the us decision spread 
hundreds of palestinian women and masked youths battled riot police 
in silwan quarter today 
shamir who initially expressed elation today toned down his 
response to bushs announcement wednesday that the us dialogue in 
tunis would be suspended because the plo did not condemn a 
guerrilla raid on israels beachfront 
i hope that the suspension will not be temporary but instead 
will open a new chapter in the relations between the us and the 
middle east shamir said on israel radio 
he said that by only suspending the talks instead of cutting 
them off permanently washington still had not made clear its 
determination to fight terrorism 
of course this raises doubts that maybe the us 
administration hasnt reached the clear conclusion that we are 
talking about a terror organization he said 
shamirs government has been pushing the united states to end 
the dialogue it started with the palestine liberation organization 
in december 1988 after arafat renounced terrorism and accepted 
israels existence 
israeli newspapers bannered their front pages with bushs 
remarks which were seen as a thaw in recently chilly usisraeli 
relations 
but analysts and editorial writers quickly noted that bush had 
suggested talks could be renewed once the plo adequately condemns 
the may 30 attack 
a plo faction the palestine national front has claimed 
responsibility for the attack 
the haaretz daily quoted an anonymous senior official close to 
shamir as saying that now the burden would be on israel to take an 
initiative in the peace process 
the newspaper noted a letter that bush sent to shamir earlier 
this week reportedly urging israel to come up with new ideas 
and now pressure on israel read the headline on a 
frontpage analysis in the yediot ahronot daily 
palestinian leaders in east jerusalem and the occupied lands 
called bushs announcement a death blow to already faltering peace 
efforts 
it is an indication that in this region there is going to be a 
vacuum in the political process and encouragement to go to war 
said hannah siniora editor of the proplo arabic language daily al 
fajr 
israel objects to any plo involvement in peace efforts claiming 
the organization is a terrorist group bent on destroying the jewish 
state

here in summary form are the supreme courts 
two previous major decisions on political patronage 
in elrod vs burns a landmark 1976 ruling the court greatly 
limited the power of government employers to fire employees because 
of their party affiliation 
the court said only policymakers and confidential employees 
could be subjected to such politically motivated firings the 
ruling reinstated five lowlevel sheriffs employees in their cook 
county ill jobs and protected numerous other employees on the 
state and federal levels as well 
in a 1980 ruling called branti vs finkel the court went 
further it ruled that even some policymakers and confidential 
employees are protected against politically motivated firings 
the ultimate inquiry is not whether the label policymaker 
or confidential fits a particular position rather the question 
is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party 
affiliation is an appropriate requirement for effective performance 
of the public office involved justice john paul stevens wrote 
for the court 
the decision upheld a lower courts order to reinstate two 
parttime rockland county ny public defenders who had been

in the illinois case two men and a woman who said their job 
status suffered because they did not vote in republican primaries 
or give money to the party sued the governor the state gop and the 
heads of several state agencies 
cynthia rutan said she repeatedly was denied promotions to 
supervisory positions in the state rehabilitative services 
department because she did not support republican candidates 
franklin taylor an equipment operator said he was denied an 
illinois transportation department transfer to another county 
because party officials opposed it 
james moore said the state corrections department has refused to 
hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key gop 
leaders 
the three sued for more than 1 billion in damages their suit 
also seeks to shift control of the state employment system to a 
courtappointed federal receiver 
during oral arguments before the justices last january their 
lawyer mary lee leahy of springfield ill said thompsons office 
has controlled all new hires since 1980 in all 62000 civil 
service jobs are under the governors jurisdiction 
she previously had submitted to the court a form used to screen 
state employees who seek a promotion and live in sangamon county 
the form asks employees to declare how they or in some cases 
their parents voted in primary elections it also asks whether the 
person would be willing to work for republicans during an election 
lawyers for thompson and state gop leaders argued that hiring 
political allies stimulates good government because the employee is 
likely to appreciate the job and in turn serve the public well 
todays decision means all the lawsuits remain alive 
several groups from the state including independent voters of 
illinois and common causeillinois argued in a 
friendofthecourt brief a politically conditioned 
employment system inhibits the free functioning of democracy 
rather than advancing it since it seeks to assist only a single 
favored political party and to dissuade all other political 
activity 
in a similar brief lawyers for the aflcio said allocating 
governmental resources purely in the interest of partisan politics 
grants the favored party an advantage that threatens the legitimacy 
of our governmental structure 
lawyers for the commonwealth of puerto rico however urged the 
justices to uphold the illinois system 
the prospect of employment is a significant incentive to 
political effort and opportunities to implement the 
administrations democratic mandate are enhanced significantly by 
patronage hiring the puerto rico lawyers contended 
these are compelling state interests which outweigh the 
possible first amendment impairment resulting from patronage 
hiring 
no other state filed a brief in support of the illinois system 
the cases are rutan vs illinois republican party 881872 and

the supreme court today generally barred 
states and energy consumers from bringing federal antitrust suits 
against energy producers accused of conspiring to fix prices 
in a 54 ruling the justices said only direct purchasers of 
energy in this case utility companies may file such suits 
the court ruled against kansas and missouri officials who 
accused a natural gas pipeline and five natural gas producers of 
illegal price fixing 
the attorneys general of 32 states had urged the high court to 
permit such suits 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court rejected 
arguments that states or residential customers should be permitted 
to sue because utilities lack incentive to go to court since they 
can pass on any overcharges to their customers 
utilities have an established record of diligent antitrust 
enforcement kennedy said history makes us quite hesitant to 
take from the utilities the responsibility for enforcing the 
antitrust laws 
also he continued consumers may lack the expertise and 
experience necessary for detecting improper pricing by a utilitys 
suppliers 
kennedy added that state officials may hesitate to sue in 
cases involving smaller more speculative harm to consumers and 
they may sue only on behalf of state residents 
joining him were chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
john paul stevens sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia 
dissenting were justices byron r white william j brennan 
thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun 
kansas and missouri officials said in their suit that energy 
producers conspired to inflate the price of the gas sold to 
utilities and that the alleged overcharges were passed on to 
consumers 
todays ruling was prompted in part by disagreement among lower 
federal courts 
the bush administration without taking sides had urged the 
high court earlier this year to resolve the uncertainty

the governments drug policy coordinator is 
taking on critics who warn that the united states is heading for 
another vietnam by giving south american countries military 
help to battle cocaine traffickers 
this is not an american invasion william j bennett said in 
a speech today to the center for strategic and international 
studies 
it is not an escalating military intervention bennett said 
our policy is that there will be no us military personnel 
involved in operations 
the drug war must be fought at the source as well as on us 
streets he said 
if these efforts are caricatured as another vietnam an 
american invasion or involvement in a foreign war then we risk 
crippling a series of strengthened relationships that our president 
and the presidents of the andean region have recently forged 
bennett said 
he acknowledged that some americans may die fighting the drug 
war overseas 
this is a dangerous enemy and we cannot expect to fight this 
battle unscathed bennett said we have already lost americans 
in fighting this battle in foreign countries if we are not 
prepared to face these risks in the future then we should not 
undertake to assist our allies 
newspaper editorial writers columnists and others have likened 
the administratins andean strategy to early us promises that 
grew into the vietnam war but few such comments have been heard on 
capitol hill 
in a recent column in the new york times tom wicker wrote 
americans can sing it seems to me ive heard that song 
before 
the libertarian cato institute issued an analysis that concluded 
given the probable consequences of enlisting the military in 
the war on drugs and especially of deploying us troops in the 
source nations of latin america it is more likely to be the moral 
and operational equivalent of americas disastrous vietnam 
intervention 
president bush met in february with the presidents of colombia 
peru and bolivia and the four agreed that their countries would 
work together against drug traffickers since then colombia and 
peru have elected new presidents 
in colombia where the government has waged a bloody war against 
drug traffickers since last august when traffickers were blamed for 
killing a leading presidential hopeful the people recently elected 
the only candidate who strongly opposed the drug trade cesar 
gaviria 
peruvian presidentelect alberto fujimori said during his 
campaign that he would reject any foreign intervention in the 
war against drugs an apparent reference to us plans to have 
military advisers train peruvian soldiers in antidrug jungle 
warfare 
fujimori who must contend with a decadelong war with leftist 
shining path guerrillas as well as cocaine traffickers said he 
favors economic support to military force to eradicate coca 
plantations 
bennett said he hopes to complete a formal agreement soon with 
peru so the united states can start providing military equipment 
and training to peruvian police and military but not economic 
assistance for now 
economic aid and trade are an integral part of our plan 
bennett said but he added no plan for crop substitution and 
economic development no matter how generous can survive when the 
farmerpeasants themselves live under the gun of domestic terror 
the united states is giving about 230 million to the three 
andean countries this year all of it for law enforcement against 
drug trafficking the administration has proposed sending 430 
million next year and plans to spend more in 1992 with economic 
aid representing about half the aid in the next two years 
for now bennett said military assistance is needed in all 
three countries to achieve a level of security that law 
enforcement personnel alone cannot provide 
the andean presidents despise drugs every bit as much as we 
do he said and they are asking for our help to fight a common 
enemy cocaine we have begun a partnership with them 
the moment they tell us they dont want our help we will step 
aside and let them fight this battle on their own bennett said

the senate finance committee today completed 
action on a bill limiting imports of apparel and footwear but made 
no recommendation on whether it should be passed 
the bill is supported by a majority of members of the house and 
senate but there is some question whether the margins are large 
enough to override a presidential veto the bush administration 
opposes the bill and president bushs advisers say they will 
recommend a veto if it passes 
president reagan vetoed similar legislation in 1985 and 1988 and 
both vetoes were sustained by congress 
sen ernest f hollings dsc chief sponsor of the bill said 
it is necessary to prevent the outright extinction of the us 
textile apparel and nonrubber footwear industry 
sen bob packwood of oregon senior republican on the finance 
committee said i cannot think of a single justifiable smidgen 
of comment to say about this bill he said it would violate 
international trade agreements and send the wrong signal at a time 
when the united states is pleading for free trade 
the bill would limit 1990 imports of textiles and textile 
products to 1 percent above last years level and allow future 
increases of 1 percentage point a year quotas on nonrubber shoes 
would be frozen at 1989 levels 
under the legislation countries that allow greater imports of 
us farm products would get preferential treatment when the annual 
quota increases are allocated 
textiles and textile products from canada and israel would be 
exempted from the limitations the bill would guarantee that 
caribbean countries would always have a market share at least as 
large as it was in 1989 
hollings argues that imports have 60 percent of the us apparel 
market and their share is growing by 12 percent a year he said 
that since president reagan took office in 1981 nearly 1500 us 
apparel companies have gone out of business and 400000 american 
workers have lost jobs in the industry 
no one spoke for the bill as the finance committee agreed 
unanimously to send it to the senate without recommendation 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the chairman said he wanted to get 
the legislation out of committee so that sponsors would not attempt 
to attach it to other bills pending before the panel

the supreme court today reinstated a former 
wrestling coachs lawsuit against an ohio newspaper ruling that 
allegedly libelous statements in the case can be treated as 
assertions of fact not merely opinion 
but the 72 ruling did not appear to reduce significantly the 
freespeech protections from libel law that opinion 
traditionally has been given by the nations courts 
for the first time the court said the constitutions first 
amendment does not require a special separate privilege for stated 
opinions 
the decision makes clear however that the factopinion 
distinction will remain important in libel cases and courts may 
continue to throw out lawsuits that seek damages for someones 
stated opinion 
led by chief justice william h rehnquist the court overturned 
an ohio supreme court ruling that had thrown out michael 
milkovichs 1975 suit against the news herald of lake county 
the willoughbybased newspaper published by the lorain journal 
co and onetime sports columnist ted diadiun now an editor with 
the plain dealer in cleveland were sued over a 1975 column that 
accused milkovich and a former high school administrator of lying 
during a court hearing 
writing for the court today rehnquist said the first amendment 
protection of free speech did not create a wholesale defamation 
exemption for anything that might be labeled opinion 
but rehnquist added that 25 years worth of supreme court 
decisions do protect pure expressions of opinion which cannot be 
proved true or false 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented from 
todays ruling but only because they would have interpreted the 
comments in diadiuns 1975 column as opinion 
rehnquist wrote the dispositive question is whether or 
not a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the statements in 
the diadiun column imply an assertion that milkovich perjured 
himself we think this question must be answered in the 
affirmative 
milkovich was coaching maple heights high schools wrestling 
team at a 1974 home meet against mentor high school when a melee 
involving both teams and spectators erupted several wrestlers were 
hospitalized 
diadiun who was at the meet wrote several articles criticizing 
milkovichs conduct 
in a jan 8 1975 column diadiun accused the coach and h don 
scott then superintendent of maple heights public schools of 
lying to a judge who had overturned disciplinary measures against 
the maple heights team 
during extensive litigation milkovich won two preliminary 
rounds before the ohio supreme court and both victories were left 
intact by the nations highest court 
in a 1984 decision the ohio court ruled that diadiuns 
statements about milkovich were reported as facts not opinion 
but in ruling on scotts related libel suit two years later the 
ohio supreme court reversed its 1984 ruling and said diadiuns 
statements were expressions of his opinion 
in an unusual move the ohio court used its aug 6 1986 
decision in scotts case to doom as well milkovichs suit against 
the paper and diadiun 
the case is milkovich vs lorain journal co 89645

the supreme court today expanded police powers 
by letting them search a home when they are let in by someone they 
mistakenly believe has authority to consent to a warrantless search 
in a 63 ruling in a case from chicago the justices said 
evidence from such searches may be used in court as long as police 
at the time of the entry reasonably believe the person who granted 
them access shared authority over the premises with the owner 
the court revived a prosecution of edward rodriguez who was 
arrested on july 26 1985 on charges he possessed cocaine and 
marijuana with intent to distribute the drugs 
police said they found drugs and drug paraphernalia in plain 
view after rodriguezs girlfriend let them into his apartment 
gale fisher who for a time shared the apartment with rodriguez 
summoned police to her mothers home and told them rodriguez beat 
her at the couples apartment she said she wanted to file a 
complaint 
the police then accompanied her to rodriguezs apartment and she 
opened the door with a key she later testified that she took the 
key from rodriguezs dresser after the two argued earlier on the 
day of his arrest 
an illionis appeals court said police violated the defendants 
rights because ms fisher lacked authority to let the police into 
the apartment 
the appeals court noted that ms fishers name was not on the 
apartment lease and she did not help pay the rent she also was not 
supposed to have access to the apartment when rodriguez was not 
there the state court said 
but justice antonin scalia writing today for the supreme court 
said police were entitled to seize the evidence unless they knew 
ms fisher did not have authority to let them in 
what we hold today does not suggest that law enforcement 
officers may always accept a persons invitation to enter 
premises scalia said determination of consent to enter must 
be judged against an objective standard would the facts available 
to the officer warrant a man of reasonable caution in the 
belief that the consenting party had authority over the premises 
the case now goes back to illinois courts to determine whether 
police reasonably believed ms fischer had authority to let them in 
in a dissenting opinion justice thurgood marshall said the 
ruling ignores the legitimate expectations of privacy on which 
individuals are entitled to rely the majority has taken away some 
of the liberty that the constitution was designed to protect 
he was joined by justices wlliam j brennan and john paul

a judge today delayed for at least 24 
hours the execution of a woman dubbed the black widow for 
killing her husband and trying to kill other men in her life 
us district judge patricia c fawsett in orlando temporarily 
blocked todays scheduled 1201 pm electrocution of judi buenoano 
at florida state prison near starke 
the case went to federal court when a split state supreme court 
rejected defense arguments wednesday that floridas electric chair 
has a defect 
the judge issued the temporary delay and scheduled a hearing for 
today to review the workings of the electric chair said richard 
doran director of criminal appeals in the state attorney generals 
office 
the 24hour postponement would begin after the hearing unless 
the judge grants the appeal and extends the execution delay 
ms buenoano 47 could become the first women executed in 
floridas electric chair since it came into use in 1924 and the 
23rd person put to death in the state since the us supreme court 
lifted its ban on capital punishment in 1976 
only one woman has been executed in the united states since the 
us supreme court ruling north carolina executed velma barfield 
by injection in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend 
prosecutors nicknamed ms buenoano the black widow because of 
her record of trying in most cases successfully to poison blow 
up or drown the men in her life she was condemened for the 1971 
fatal poisoning of her husband 
her latest state appeal was based on the botched execution in 
florida of jesse tafero flames and smoke shot out from under 
taferos hood may 4 and witnesses said he seemed to breathe and 
move after two of the three jolts he was given 
defense attorneys allege tafero was burned alive and that ms 
buenoano would suffer the same fate because a faulty electrode has 
not been fixed 
such a fate they argue would violate the constitutions ban on 
cruel and unusual punishment 
we are fully confident that we know what went wrong in the 
last execution and its been fixed said jon peck a spokesman 
for gov bob martinez 
the department of corrections concluded the problem with 
taferos execution was the use of a synthetic sponge under the 
headpiece instead of the usual natural sponge tafero did not 
suffer because of it and the sponge was replaced the department 
said 
in wednesdays 43 ruling floridas high court said the matter 
was one for the executive branch of government and that the court 
must presume the corrections department would carry out its duties 
properly 
one malfunction is not sufficient to justify a judicial 
inquiry into the department of corrections competence the court 
said 
in a dissent justice gerald kogan said he found it difficult to 
believe the sponge was the main problem he warned of a ghastly 
possibility 
in another dissent justice rosemary barkett said to my 
knowledge this is the first time any court has ever held that it is 
the executive branch that decides without question or appeal a 
constitutional claim of cruel or unusual punishment 
ms buenoano was condemned for murdering her husband air force 
sgt james e goodyear his body was exhumed a decade later after a 
car bombing injured ms buenoanos boyfriend 
she was also convicted of killing her 19yearold paralyzed son 
by pushing him from a canoe in 1980 
she was convicted of attempted murder in the car bombing and is 
suspected of using arsenic to kill a commonlaw husband in colorado 
in 1977

the supreme court today upheld a convicted 
louisiana murderers death sentence refusing to let him argue that 
jurors were misled about their role in the lifeordeath decision 
by a 54 vote the court said death row inmate robert sawyer 
cannot benefit from its 1985 decision baring death sentences when 
sentencing jurors are told things that minimize their 
responsibility in choosing between life or death 
sawyer whose initial round of appeals were completed before 
that 1985 decision was announced had tried to raise the 
misledjury argument in federal court 
led by justice anthony m kennedy the court today relied on a 
1989 ruling in which it said a new rule of constitutional law 
cannot be applied retroactively to cases where initial rounds of 
appeals have been exhausted 
kennedy said the courts 1985 decision on misled juries 
announced such a new rule 
because sawyer seeks the benefit of a new rule his claim 
for habeas corpus relief is without merit kennedy said 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia 
justices thurgood marshall william j brennan harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens dissented 
writing for the four marshall said the jury that sentenced 
sawyer to death was deliberately misled about the significance of 
its verdict that sawyer was thus denied a fundamentally fair trial 
was as apparent when sawyers conviction became final as it is 
today 
marshall added the courts refusal to allow a federal habeas 
court to correct this error is yet another indication that the 
court is less concerned with safeguarding constitutional rights 
that with speeding defendants deserving or not to the 
executioner 
sawyer was convicted of a murder committed in new orleans 12 
years ago 
he and charles lane beat fran arwood scalded her with boiling 
water and set her afire after dousing her with lighter fluid 
lane pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison 
sawyer refused to plead stood trial and was convicted in 1981 
in closing arguments of sawyers sentencing trial a prosecutor 
told jurors that their recommendation of life or death as 
punishment would be reviewed by several courts 
but the judges instructions to jurors made clear that they had 
the direct responsibility to determine life or death

the supreme court dealt a devastating blow to 
political patronage today ruling that government employers 
generally may not base hiring transfer and promotion decisions on 
someones party affiliation 
by a 54 vote the justices said refusing to hire transfer or 
promote people for politically partisan reasons in most cases 
violates their constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and 
association 
the court said partisanship may play a role in such employment 
decisions only when political affiliation is an appropriate 
requirement for carrying out a job such as a highlevel policy 
adviser 
unless these patronage practices are narrowly tailored to 
further vital government interests we must conclude that they 
impermissibly encroach on first amendment freedoms justice 
william j brennan wrote for the court 
the decision reinstates a lawsuit by three illinois residents 
against gov james thompson and republican leaders in the state 
its sweeping prohibitions apply as well to federal and local 
government employers 
in a landmark 1976 ruling and a 1980 sequel the high court 
significantly weakened the political patronage system sometimes 
called the spoils system 
the rulings prohibited government employers from firing anyone 
even some policymaking and confidential government workers 
solely because of their political party unless party loyalty is a 
requirement for effective performance 
but those decisions dealt only with firings 
before today the court never had said partisanship can play no 
role in hiring transfers and promotions as well 
the court also struck down patronage powers of government 
employers in laying off and rehiring public employees 
in other action the court 
expanded police powers by allowing them to search a home when 
they are let in by someone they mistakenly believe has authority to 
consent to a warrantless search 
in a 63 ruling in a case from chicago the justices said 
evidence from such searches may be used in court as long as police 
at the time of the entry reasonably believe the person who granted 
them access shared authority over the premises with the owner 
reinstated a former wrestling coachs lawsuit against an ohio 
newspaper ruling that allegedly libelous statements in the case 
can be treated as assertions of fact not merely opinion 
but the 72 ruling did not appear to reduce significantly the 
freespeech protections from libel law that opinion traditionally 
has been given by the nations courts

generally barred states and energy consumers from bringing 
federal antitrust suits against energys producers accused of 
conspiring to fix prices 
in a 54 ruling the justices said only direct purchasers of 
energy in this case utility companies may file such suits 
a federal appeals court had upheld the illinois patronage policy 
in hiring transfers and promotions but banned such considerations 
in layoffs and rehirings it said layoffs are too similar to 
firings 
brennan said employee loyalty to government policies can be 
ensured without widespread patronage 
a governments interest in securing employees who will loyally 
implement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or 
dismissing certain highlevel employees on the basis of their 
political views he said 
brennan was joined by justices byron r white thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
anthony m kennedy and sandra day oconnor dissented 
in a dissenting opinion scalia wrote today the court makes 
its constitutional civilservice reform absolute extending to all 
decisions regarding government employment 
in the illinois patronage case two men and a woman who said 
their job status suffered because they did not vote in republican 
primaries or give money to the party sued the governor the state 
gop and the heads of several state agencies 
cynthia rutan said she repeatedly was denied promotions to 
supervisory positions in the state rehabilitative services 
department because she did not support republican candidates 
franklin taylor an equipment operator said he was denied an 
illinois transportation department transfer to another county 
because party officials opposed it 
james moore said the state corrections department has refused to 
hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key gop 
leaders 
the three sued for more than 1 billion in damages their suit 
also seeks to shift control of the state employment system to a 
courtappointed federal receiver 
during oral arguments before the justices last january their 
lawyer mary lee leahy of springfield ill said thompsons office 
has controlled all new hires since 1980 in all 62000 civil 
service jobs are under the governors jurisdiction 
she previously had submitted to the court a form used to screen 
state employees who seek a promotion and live in sangamon county 
the form asks employees to declare how they or in some cases 
their parents voted in primary elections it also asks whether the 
person would be willing to work for republicans during an election 
lawyers for thompson and state gop leaders argued that hiring 
political allies stimulates good government because the employee is 
likely to appreciate the job and in turn serve the public well 
todays decision means all the lawsuits remain alive 
several groups from the state including independent voters of 
illinois and common causeillinois argued in a 
friendofthecourt brief a politically conditioned 
employment system inhibits the free functioning of democracy 
rather than advancing it since it seeks to assist only a single 
favored political party and to dissuade all other political 
activity 
in a similar brief lawyers for the aflcio said allocating 
governmental resources purely in the interest of partisan politics 
grants the favored party an advantage that threatens the legitimacy 
of our governmental structure 
lawyers for the commonwealth of puerto rico however urged the 
justices to uphold the illinois system 
the prospect of employment is a significant incentive to 
political effort and opportunities to implement the 
administrations democratic mandate are enhanced significantly by 
patronage hiring the puerto rico lawyers contended 
these are compelling state interests which outweigh the

nonprofit social clubs may not gain a federal 
tax advantage by deliberately incurring losses from selling food 
and drink to nonmembers the supreme court ruled today 
the court ruled unanimously that the portland golf club in 
oregon may not use such losses to offset investment profits 
the internal revenue service had said a decision in its favor 
would mean a federal revenue gain of at least 4 million nationwide 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said clubs may 
use losses incurred in sales to nonmembers to offset investment 
income only if the sales were motivated by an intent to make a 
profit the portland club failed to show it tried to make a profit 
he said 
the club is exempt from paying federal income tax on dues and 
other fees paid by its members it qualifies for the exemption as a 
social club organized for pleasure recreation and other 
nonprofitable purposes 
the club also receives income from selling food and drink to 
nonmembers and in interest from its investments that income is 
not exempt from federal taxation 
the irs said the club owed 5298 in taxes for 1980 and 1981 
the club said it lost 98041 those two years from selling food 
and drink to nonmembers because its expenses and overhead for that 
activity exceeded income from the sales 
the club sought to use the losses to offset profits from its 
investments 
the case is portland golf club vs commissioner of internal 
revenue 89530

the city council is investigating reports of 
death threats allegedly made by security forces against one of 
president carlos salinas de gortaris harshest critics 
in the latest report of government intimidation of opponents 
jorge castaneda a writer and opposition leader said his secretary 
was stopped in her car friday and monday and told her employer 
would be killed if he continued his activities 
the governing institutitional revolutionary party issued a 
statement calling the threats against castaneda repugnant and 
saying the case would be a good test for the new human rights 
commission news reports said today 
salinas also condemned the attempt to intimidate one of his 
staunchest critics saying in a letter sunday to the liberal 
newspaper la jornada that there would be no impunity for those who 
threatened freedom of thought 
the usbased committee for the protection of journalists said 
wednesday it was profoundly worried by the threats and attacks 
against castaneda and his secretary mariana rodriguez villegas 
similar death threats were received by a state human rights 
commission head norma corona before her mysterious killing on may 
21 the killing led to the formation of a new federal human rights 
commission 
in a recent report the new yorkbased americas watch said 
violent human rights abuses have become institutionalized in mexico 
this pattern of excessive violence and abuse can only mean 
that either the mexican government has adopted a policy of 
tolerating such behavior or it has lost control over its police 
security and prosecutorial agencies the report said it cited 
several cases in which journalists were intimidated kidnapped or 
murdered 
salinas administration has pledged to end corruption and 
strongarm tactics by his party which has governed mexico since 
its founding 61 years ago 
the official government newspaper el nacional has suggested 
that the threats were imagined an assertion that has been roundly 
criticized by human rights groups other opposition figures and 
politicians 
we demand not just words from the federal government but 
actions that will put an end to this kind of thing mexico city 
councilman ruben venadero valenzuela said wednesday 
ms rodriguez said a man stopped her monday pulled her from her 
car by the hair and said something bad will happen to you if you 
dont stop going to the prosecutor 
the committee for the protection of journalists said in its 
release that the assault the second on ms rodriguez came hours 
after she identified one of the people in the first incident as a 
former official of the federal police 
the committee based in new york monitors conditions for 
journalists worldwide 
castaneda who has written for newsweek the los angeles times 
and the critical mexican magazine process is a supporter of 
opposition party leader cuauhtemoc cardenas cardenas ran a strong 
second in the 1988 presidential election and alleged that only 
widespread vote rigging gave salinas the triumph 
ms corona a 37yearold lawyer in culiacan capital of the 
northern state of sinaloa had publicly accused the federal 
attorney generals office of stalling the investigation of the 
february killings of four of her clients 
as president of the private sinaloa state human rights 
commission ms corona had successfully lobbied for recent state 
legislation sending any police officer convicted of torture to 
prison for 10 years 
she was gunned down on a culiacan street 
shortly before her death she told reporters im afraid i 
think something bad is going to happen to me the federal judicial 
police are after me if something happens to me the federal 
judicial police will be responsible according to news reports

the supreme court today reinstated a texas 
mans life sentence in the sexual assault of a young woman 
the court unanimously overturned a federal appeals court ruling 
that said the defendant carroll youngblood is entitled to a new 
trial 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that 
youngblood must be retried because his life sentence was combined 
improperly with a 10000 fine 
the appeals court said that at the time of his conviction texas 
law did not allow sentences that included both prison terms and 
fines 
but chief justice william h rehnquist in his opinion for the 
high court said youngbloods rights were not violated 
youngblood was not punished for an act that was legal at the 
time it was committed nor was his punishment increased by a law 
enacted after the commission of a crime said rehnquist 
the texas legislature acting after youngbloods conviction but 
before his federal court appeal was resolved revised state law to 
allow appeals courts to change unauthorized sentences by removing 
fines no retrial is required under the state law 
youngblood was convicted of abducting a 20yearold woman from 
her home and forcing her to drive to a secluded area where he 
sexually assaulted her 
according to court documents a previous conviction was taken 
into consideration when youngblood was sentenced to life

several members of 
parliament could be put in an awkward position if action is taken 
on a recommendation that polygamy be outlawed 
polygamy is traditional in many parts of the country and 
several politicians have more than one wife but according to a 
report by the task force on family law reform polygamy is not 
permitted under the constitution which stipulates equal rights for 
women the task force said this week the practice should be banned 
the alternative is polyandry allowing women to have more than 
one husband but this is not practical because the constitution 
also stipulates that papua new guinea is a christian country the 
report said 
therefore it is best for everyone to have only one wife or 
one husband it concluded 
the task force said it was considering recommending that the law 
reform commission ask parliament to abolish polygamy within two 
years athough existing polygamous marriages should continue to be 
recognized

bernard pivot frances no 1 literary ambassador 
says goodbye friday night to millions of viewers after 15 years as 
host of a talk show that turned authors and books into television 
stars 
the rumpled affable pivot who became a national institution as 
host of apostrophes transformed books into topics of public 
debate and kept even avid tv viewers in contact with the world of 
literature 
an authors appearance on the weekly 90minute show nearly 
guaranteed increased book sales 
publishers are going to have to use their imagination now 
said francois nourissier of the academie goncourt the prestigious 
literary circle that awards frances top book prize each year for 
15 years he said pivot did a good part of the publishers job 
studies show that apostrophes influenced up to onethird of 
bookbuyers in 1982 regis debray former counselor to president 
francois mitterrand complained that pivot was becoming a 
dictator of the book market 
pivot 55 said he was bowing out after 724 shows because he is 
tired of reading 10 hours a day his eyes his taste and even 
authors are wearing out on him le figaro magazine wrote 
the authors have changed it quoted pivot as saying they 
get on too well i try sometimes to spark a fire but the fire 
doesnt take 
pivot first noticed a problem when he began disliking novels 
especially historical novels and most especially those about the 
middle ages and the french revolution the magazine wrote 
a lover of soccer and beaujolais pivot brought books into 
frances living rooms making his literary gathering a sporting 
event as one publisher put it 
pivot desanctified books said francoise verny literary 
director of the publishing house flammarion thanks to him books 
became familiar to everyone 
so did pivot an elfin facedman with unkempt hair and 
halfspecs sliding down his nose who every friday at 930 pm 
gathered an assortment of authors to discuss praise or criticize 
each others books 
occasionally pivot spent his weekly rendezvous with a single 
author he traveled to the vermont home of soviet exile alexander 
solzhenitsyn and the swiss home of vladimir nabokov 
conspiratorially pouring whiskey from a tea pot for his illatease 
guest throughout the 90 minutes 
a little more tea mr nabokov 
with pleasure but i find it a bit strong nabokov replied 
politicians from former president valery giscard destaing to 
soviet radical boris yeltsin also appeared on apostrophes 
all the books launched on apostrophes were not 
masterpieces le figaro magazine quoted pivot as saying and 
all masterpieces were not launched by apostrophes but since 
1975 nothing which has made the life of books and the shock of 
ideas escaped apostrophes 
the show which already has inspired a spinoff on a competing 
channel will be replaced by another literary show pivot himself 
plans to return to the tv public in 1991 with what he calls a 
cultural magazine

that inspired playwright henrik ibsen to use maritime themes in his 
dramas the national news agency ntb reported thursday

120 feet of water off grimstad a southern town where ibsen did his 
first serious writing the agency said a bell engraved with the 
ships name charitas was brought up several months ago after a 
years search 
the find will have a place in world history because of its 
clear influence in the captains grandson said an ibsen expert 
bjoern hemmer in a ceremony at grimstads ibsen museum 
the playwright heard about the shipwreck from his grandmother 
in his works ibsen described the sea as compelling and 
threatening and used shipwrecks as symbols of human defeat and 
destiny 
ibsen among the most influential precursors of modern theater 
is best known for his late 19thcentury plays such as ghosts 
and enemy of the people which centered on rebellion against 
social restrictions

the years longest day for many 
residents of northern latitudes consists of midnight barbecues and 
3 am softball games but for some the total lack of darkness is 
no fun at all 
in much of alaska and other parts of the north summer solstice 
june 21 brings 24 hours of daylight and one of the years most 
celebrated times the clanging of icecream trucks can be heard 
late into the evening to the delight of children bedtime never 
seems to come 
but while most northerners blossom some just cannot adapt 
it was really bizarre said paul korchin who spent three 
years in nome on the bering sea and recently returned to virginia 
i found it extremely difficult to get a good nights sleep even 
the littlest crack of light would bug me 
the sun shining brightly past midnight freaked me out he 
said all that light would get on my nerves 
korchin whose jobs included a stint as a police dispatcher 
said all summer long he felt bedraggled it got so bad i went to 
the clinic to get checked out 
eventually he taped cardboard over his windows so he could 
sleep 
along the arctic coast the sun has been up since may 11 arcing 
through the sky it will set again aug 2 even as far south as 
anchorage twilight lasts all night though the sun does set for 
about 3 hours 
north of the arctic circle in communities along the arctic 
ocean such as barrow and wainwright residents in summer hunt and 
fish work and play all day 
we just dont sleep your body feels like it doesnt need 
sleep said eric loring an anthropologist in anchorage 
for two years loring has studied native life at wainwright a 
village more than 700 miles northwest of anchorage when he first 
arrived there he went to a whaling camp because it never got 
dark he said he lost all track of time 
when i got back home i thought it had been just a day or 
two he said 
five days had passed 
i just could not believe it he said 
although loring has studied northern populations for 13 years 
mostly in canada he still expresses amazement at differences in 
daily life 
its flat out youre up youre about hunting caribou 
whatever time it happens to be theres no clock 
he adds some people do go nuts to me now its just 
normal and its kind of weird to sleep in the dark now 
recreation begins after dinner often as late as 1 am or 2 
am softball and volleyball games are continuous and children 
talk to each other through the night on citizens band radios the 
primary form of communication in the village 
but then theres the dark side in winter theres no light 
especially above the arctic circle 
and it results in what some call cabin fever that depression 
and frustration that creeps up during long spells of darkness and 
bad weather 
scientists call it seasonal affective disorder or sad and its 
effects can be mild or devastating depending on the sufferer 
depression increases significantly among northern populations 
during the winter said dr carla hellekson a psychiatrist and 
sleepdisorder specialist at the providence sleep disorders center 
of seattle 
sad causes some people to sleep 14 to 16 hours a day overeat 
become agitated and generally complain of the winter blahs 
hellekson said 
that contrasts with what hellekson calls summer energy 
syndrome 
people are on a roll talking more shedding weight its 
not a disorder dont call it hypermania she says 
dr ted mala who heads the institute for circumpolar health 
studies in anchorage says the explanation is partly chemical the 
pineal gland in the brain secretes more endorphins under 
fullspectrum light the result people feel better in summer

the arrests in east germany this month of nine reputed members of 
the red army faction the leftist group has been blamed for a 
series of bombings and killings in west germany 
east german interior minister petermichael diestel alleged this 
week that harboring terrorists was the personal hobby of 
honecker and his secret police chief erich mielke both were 
ousted in last falls peaceful revolution 
in the west german city of karlsruhe on thursday state 
prosecutor gerhard klass said he had opened an investigation into 
honecker for alleged obstruction of justice 
we suspect that honecker and his secret police agents hindered 
the pursuit of red army faction terrorists sought in arrest 
warrants klass told reporters 
klass said the suspicion involves providing mostwanted 
criminals a place to live false identity etc 
in a later telephone interview klass said the maximum penalty 
ranges from a small fine to five years in prison 
this does not involve only honecker it includes mielke and 
all the way down to the ones that knowingly gave them shelter 
klass said 
the badenwuerrtemberg state prosecutor said he has jurisdiction 
in the case because the original arrest warrants against the 
terrorists were issued in karlsruhe which is in the state 
however the federal prosecutors office which issued the 
warrants has said it does not plan to investigate honecker 
asked if he really expected honecker or any of the others to be 
extradited for trial klass responded that we cant even 
speculate at this time we have to see what the investigation turns 
up 
klass did not say how long he expected the investigation to take 
shortly after klass announcement honeckers lawyer friedrich 
wolff rejected the allegations 
on wednesday honecker denied that his ousted government 
sheltered terrorists and blamed the charges on a campaign against 
the good reputation of his government 
honecker in a rare public statement defended what he said was 
his communist governments pursuit of peace and its fight against 
terrorism 
nothing in these accusations corresponds to reality 
honecker said in a statement released through the east german 
government news agency adn 
all the reputed terrorists arrested had false identities and 
some said they had been aided by members of honeckers secret 
police some had been fugitives more than a decade 
the red army faction waged a deadly terrorist war against west 
german capitalism and nato in the 1970s and 1980s the most recent 
victim deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen was killed in a bomb

the us aircraft carrier midway docked 
at its home base today after two shipboard explosions killed two 
crew members and injured 16 others nine seriously officials said 
midway is safe and seaworthy in all respects rear adm lyle 
bull commander of the battle force 7th fleet told about 100 
reporters aboard the 67000ton ship a day after the blasts 
the safety of the ship was never in jeopardy bull said 
shortly after the ship moored at the us naval base in yokosuka 
30 miles southwest of tokyo 
the commander stressed there was no danger to the ships weapons 
area from the explosions in a 12by12foot storeroom for 
firefighting and other emergency equipment on the fourth deck 
about six decks below the flight deck 
aside from the nine seriously injured who were flown to 
hospitals ashore seven injured crewmen were treated on the ship 
the navy said 
bull said the casualties occurred when a firefighting crew 
investigated smoke coming from the storeroom shortly before noon 
wednesday the first explosion occurred when they opened the hatch 
and entered he said 
for two of the sailors death most probably was 
instantaneous bull said they had earlier been listed as missing 
the pentagon identified the two dead today as ulric patrick 
johnson of martinez calif and jeffrey allan vierra of nevada 
city calif 
johnson 20 was a mess management specialist and had been 
inducted into the service in december 1987 vierra also 20 was a 
fireman and had been inducted into the navy in september 1988 the 
pentagon said 
the names of those injured were not released 
bull said the room was near a pipe for the ships catapult 
system containing steam at 850 degrees fahrenheit and water 
sprayed on the bulkhead turned to steam thats how hot it was 
but he declined to speculate on the cause of the explosion or 
whether it was related to the steam pipe he said the cause still 
was under investigation 
while bull acknowledged there was smoke before the explosion he 
said there was no proof a fire occurred cmdr mark j stull 
public affairs officer for us naval forces japan had said 
earlier that a fire in the storeroom had been put out shortly after 
midnight wednesday 
bull said the first explosion occurred at about 1230 pm 
wednesday the second at 115 pm it was confined to a small 
area there was no rocking of the midway 
he said the midway scheduled to remain at sea another two 
weeks returned to port early to give the crew a rest and to 
replenish our firefighting equipment we did not have to come in 
but there was no reason to stay out 
outside the bases gate about 50 antinuclear demonstrators 
chanted dont let the midway land here and dont let in 
nuclear weapons 
eight wore sashes identifying them as victims of the us atomic 
bombings of the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 
earlier about 20 japanese demonstrators from three citizens 
groups and the greenpeace environmental organization held signs 
protesting the us military presence in japan 
about 12 protesters tried to enter the base but were blocked by 
japanese police and us marines after a few minutes of shoving 
and shouting the police locked arms pushed the demonstrators back 
and locked the metal gate 
critics contend us ships have brought nuclear weapons into 
japanese ports despite a japanese ban against them as a matter of 
policy the united states refuses to comment on the location of its 
nuclear weapons 
japan is the only country that has experienced nuclear attacks 
and many japanese still have misgivings about the presence of 
50000 us troops and armaments 
city officials had demanded the midway be barred from returning 
until its safety had been confirmed and cause of the incident 
clarified 
the midway fire was the second serious navy accident since a

62 aircraft and has two steam catapults used to launch planes from 
the flight deck the 1000foot carrier was commissioned in 1945 
and is the navyss oldest in active service although it has been 
extensively modernized 
the incident occurred as the midway participated in a joint 
exercise 125 miles northeast of yokosuka with the japanese maritime 
self defense force stull said it was not known whether the 
exercise would continue 
in the last major fire aboard a us warship a predawn blaze

a senate panel passed a resolution today that 
praised president bush for suspending talks with the palestine 
liberation organization and spelled out conditions for resumption 
of the dialogue 
the 131 vote in the senate foreign relations committee 
reflected the widespread support that bush has garnered on capitol 
hill for his action on wednesday only sen gordon humphrey 
rnh voted against the resolution which has over 40 cosponsors 
the resolution which now goes to the senate floor demands that 
plo chairman yasser arafat expel abu abbas from the organization 
renounce all forms of terrorism and recognize israels right to 
exist it also commended bush 
sen connie mack rfla said the plo broke the trust that the 
united states placed in it by allowing terrorism 
that trust cannot and must not be restored without concrete 
actions that irrevocably demonstrate that the plo has abandoned 
terrorism once and for all he said 
lawmakers said the next move was arafats 
i hope that the plo will take the steps necessary to allow 
resumption of the dialogue based on the commitments undertaken by 
it in december 1988 senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said wednesday 
bush earlier in the day called a halt to the 18monthold 
dialogue with the plo because the umbrella group failed to condemn 
forcefully enough an aborted terrorist attack in israel on may 30 
the attack was thwarted when israeli defenders intercepted the 
guerrillas killing four and capturing 12 abu abbas a member of 
the plo executive committee claimed responsibility for the attack 
mitchell called bushs action a correct decision and others 
joined in praise 
the ball is in the plos court said senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan it must unequivocally condemn the recent 
terrorist attack it must discipline those responsible starting 
with abu abbas 
by suspending talks with the plo bush avoided a possible 
confrontation with congress over proposed legislation that called 
for a cutoff of the usplo dialogue 
if the president had not suspended the dialogue with the plo 
that would have been tantamount to giving terrorist elements within 
the organization a green light to renew their attacks on 
civilians said sen joseph lieberman dconn 
today the senate foreign relations committee passed a 
resolution commending bush for his action the vote was 131 the 
measure also spells out conditions the plo must meet if talks are 
to resume those conditions mirror the ones set out by bush 
john kelly assistant secretary of state for the middle east 
said at a house hearing that the decision could spark a wave of 
violence in terrorism in the middle east possibly undermining 
prospects for peace 
but lieberman said the failure to suspend the talks would 
result in more violence not peace acts of terrorism must be met 
with a strong response 
rep larry smith dfla one of israels staunchest supporters 
in congress said he was concerned that bush might try to 
reinstitute the usplo dialogue without waiting for substantive 
policy changes from the palestinian group 
to prevent such as occurrence smith proposed legislation to set 
strict terms for the plo to meet before talks resume 
the plo cant go back to their old ways added rep charles 
schumer dny 
rep william broomfield of michigan the senior republican on 
the house foreign affairs committee said bushs decision was the 
only one he could have made under the circumstances 
america must let arafat know that the plo cant talk peace and 
wage war at the same time broomfield said president bush was 
wise to suspend rather than terminate the talks arafat should know 
that the united states is still willing to cooperate in the search 
for peace but not under the barrel of a gun

lawyers for the woman dubbed robin hud are 
disputing prosecutors contentions that she gave to charity only 
11 million of the more than 6 million she stole from the 
department of housing and urban development 
marilyn louise harrell whose sentencing was scheduled friday 
pleaded guilty in january to stealing government property and 
failing to report income for taxes 
the 46yearold temple hills escrow agent gained the moniker 
robin hud by federal investigators because she claimed she gave 
most of the embezzled money to charities 
but prosecutors have contended harrell donated only 11 million 
to charities and spent most of the rest on herself her family and 
her businesses 
in documents filed wednesday in us district court harrells 
attorneys said the amount she spent to help others totaled more 
than 51 million 
the papers however show the total includes 155956 that went 
to members of harrells family 183000 for taxes and hundreds of 
thousands of dollars poured into numerous businesses to the benefit 
of friends relatives and business associates 
i cannot and will not deny that her family did benefit said 
attorney anthony r gallagher who represents harrell but 
certainly the bulk of the money did not go to marilyn harrell and 
her family 
based on the charitable giving and harrells cooperation with 
investigators gallagher will urge us district judge herbert f 
murray to sentence her to 16 months in prison 
federal prosecutors intend to argue for a 46month term

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken thursday by the supreme court 
 
political patronage 
 
the court dealt a devastating blow to political patronage today 
ruling that government employers generally may not base hiring 
transfer and promotion decisions on someones party affiliation 
by a 54 vote the justices said refusing to hire transfer or 
promote people for politically partisan reasons in most cases 
violates their constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and 
association 
the court said partisanship may play a role in such employment 
decisions only when political affiliation is an appropriate 
requirement for carrying out a job such as a highlevel policy 
adviser 
the cases are rutan vs illinois republican party 881872 and 
frech vs rutan 882074 
 
police searches 
 
the court expanded police powers by allowing them to search a 
home when they are let in by someone they mistakenly believe has 
authority to consent to a warrantless search 
in a 63 ruling in a case from chicago the justices said 
evidence from such searches may be used in court as long as police 
at the time of the entry reasonably believe the person who granted 
them access shared authority over the premises with the owner 
the case is illinois vs rodriguez 882018 
 
libel 
 
the court reinstated a former wrestling coachs lawsuit against 
an ohio newspaper ruling that allegedly libelous statements in the 
case can be treated as assertions of fact not merely opinion 
but the 72 ruling did not appear to reduce significantly the 
freespeech protections from libel law that opinion traditionally 
has been given by the nations courts 
for the first time the court said the constitutions first 
amendment does not require a special separate privilege for stated 
opinions the decision makes clear however that the factopinion 
distinction will remain important in libel cases and courts may 
continue to throw out lawsuits that seek damages for someones 
stated opinions 
the case is milkovich vs lorain journal co 89645 
 
gas 
 
the court generally barred states and energy consumers from 
bringing federal antitrust suits against energys producers accused 
of conspiring to fix prices 
in a 54 ruling the justices said only direct purchasers of 
energy in this case utility companies may file such suits 
the case is kansas vs utilicorp united inc 882109 
 
social clubs 
 
nonprofit social clubs may not gain a federal tax advantage by 
deliberately incurring losses from selling food and drink to 
nonmembers the supreme court ruled today 
the court ruled unanimously that the portland golf club in 
oregon may not use such losses to offset investment profits 
the internal revenue service had said a decision in its favor 
would mean a federal revenue gain of at least 4 million nationwide 
the case is portland golf club vs commissioner of internal 
revenue 89530

and masked youths clashed with riot police after an arab was killed 
there in an earlier protest over the us decision 
prime minister yitzhak shamir urged the united states to 
permanently end talks with the plo 
shamir who initially expressed elation toned down his response 
to president bushs announcement wednesday that the dialogue would 
be suspended bush made the decision because the plo failed to 
condemn an attempted raid on israel on may 30 by a palestinian 
faction 
i hope that the suspension will not be temporary but instead 
will open a new chapter in relations between the united states and 
the middle east shamir said on israel radio

be clear until it cut its dialogue with the plo permanently 
israel objects to any plo involvement in peace efforts claiming 
the organization is a terrorist group bent on destroying the jewish 
state israel has been pushing the united states to end its 
dialogue with the plo since it began in december 1988 after plo 
chief yasser arafat renounced terrorism

could mean more american pressure on israel to forge a new peace 
strategy

to come up with a reciprocal peace gesture

bank cities

the us economy advanced at its second 
slowest pace in 3 years from january through march the government 
reported thursday analysts said they expect only modest 
improvement for the rest of the year 
but the economists said any future growth would be fueled in 
large part by exports after a fall off in consumer spending which 
had been a driving force for the economy through much of the 
economic expansion 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
nations total output of goods and services grew at a revised 19 
percent annual rate in the first quarter 
at the same time the department revised a price index tied to 
the gnp to show an annualized inflation rate of 64 percent for the 
quarter the department said half of that increase was due to 
rising food and energy prices caused by unusual winter weather and 
analysts predicted prices would decline during the remainder of the 
year 
if the gnp and inflation reports are combined with other more 
recent economic indicators the economy is in pretty good shape 
although nobodys talking about a boom said michael k evans of 
evans economics inc a washington forecasting firm 
considering some of the recession forecasts we heard earlier 
in the year thats not at all bad he added a recession 
generally is defined as two consecutive declines in the gnp and has 
not occurred since 198182 
nevertheless the economy is growing slower than the 30 percent 
gain of 1989 and the 44 percent advance of 1988 
the picture is one of sluggishness said economist cynthia 
latta of drimcgrawhill a lexington mass forecasting 
organization sluggishness today and tomorrow and probably for 
several months to come 
the firstquarter gnp was up from the 11 percent annualized 
rate in the final quarter of 1989 that was the slowest advance 
since a 08 percent gain in the summer of 1986 
the department said a larger export total than had been reported 
was the largest factor in revising the firstquarter gnp from the 
meager 11 percent gain it had calculated last month it originally 
had projected in april that growth during the period had been 21 
percent 
exports increased 128 percent during the period while imports 
grew only 30 percent 
exports are keeping the recovery alive evans said 
consumer spending meanwhile was revised from a 24 percent 
increase reported last month to just 16 percent in thursdays 
report 
the lower consumption is consistent with the other news about 
consumers said ms latta noting earlier government reports that 
retail sales have declined for three straight months through may 
the first time that has happened since the fall of 1981 during the 
last recession 
retail sales represent about half of overall consumer spending 
which itself accounts for about twothirds of the nations economic 
activity 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
totalling 4193 trillion after the first three months of the year

the wood carver who created 
percy the blackringed new jersey seagull was no artist say tax 
officials who levied a stiff import duty on the wooden decoy 
richmond lumber dealer clark robertson received percy as a gift 
from a customer the customer had carved the bird out of leftover 
alaska yellow cedar that was shipped by robertson 
robertson balked when revenue canada said he owes 7337 in duty 
and taxes on the bird 
after receiving the assessment in early may he wrote the agency 
to protest saying hed tried to appraise the bird by comparing it 
to other handcarved gulls but couldnt find one that even 
remotely resembles percy 
robertson put the cost of the wood between 5 and 725 
our customer is a hobbyist who carves for sheer enjoyment by 
the appearance of the decoy i suspect it may well have been one of 
his initial attempts as it was absolutely lousy he wrote 
as a matter of fact it is so bad that the only good part of 
the whole scenario is that it scared away all those nasty crows 
that have been frequenting our back garden 
exactly replied the government original sculptures and 
statuary signed by the artist are exempt from duty and taxes but 
statuettes and other ornaments of wood are not 
it appears clear to us in ottawa that your friend is not a 
bona fide artist and as such the proper tariff and duty rates were 
charged you wrote revenue canada officer gaston gingrass 
gingrass included some forms for robertson to appeal the levy 
but when robertson got all the paper each of which had six carbon 
copies he said he wont pursue the matter 
he did offer to surrender this apparition to her majesty the 
queen via revenue canada 
theres been no reply he said

german unification will drive up us interest 
rates and slow economic growth here but the adverse effects will be 
offset somewhat by greater demand for american exports economic 
experts told congress on thursday 
the united states will see higher interest rates for quite 
some time because of greater global competition for capital 
triggered by efforts to rebuild east germany and the other eastern 
european nations said c michael aho director of economic studies 
at the council on foreign relations 
in the near future the investmentstarved economies of 
eastern europe are likely to begin soaking up funds like a dry 
sponge aho told the joint economic committee in a world of 
higher real interest rates the united states as the worlds 
largest debtor nation borrowing 300 million a day 
internationally would be in a vulnerable position 
with the us economy already sluggish the need to boost us 
interest rates to attract foreign capital will mean americas 
economic woes may be aggravated by having to pay more to balance 
its books 
aho cited studies showing a 1 percent rise in world interest 
rates would slow us economic growth by 04 percent in the first 
year and 06 percent in the second year a significant drop given 
the sluggish 19 percent us growth rate so far this year 
but stephen cooney director of international investment for the 
national association of manufacturers said higher interest rates 
would be partially offset by stronger demand for american exports 
he said rising demand for american products in western europe 
has translated into 1 million new jobs in this country since 1985 
and the demand should continue particularly for capital goods such 
as computers and heavy machinery needed to overhaul eastern 
europes manufacturing sector 
aho said dramatic changes in eastern europe would also increase 
pressure on american lawmakers to boost taxes and cut federal 
spending as a way of cutting the federal budget shortfall and thus 
reducing americas demand for foreign capital 
robert hormats vice chairman of goldman sachs international 
said joining east and west germany wouldnt do that much harm to 
other economies because west germans have strong resources to fund 
the unification 
but hormats warned that west germany may have to divert some of 
those resources to the soviet union to bargain for kremlin 
acceptance of a united germany in nato 
hormats said the bonn government may be called on to subsidize 
continued east german exports to the soviet union to help with 
emergency shipments of consumer goods there and to pay a portion of 
the cost of building civilian housing for returning red army troops

a new tombstone was supposed to honor 
william lindley wilcox for his civil war service with the union 
army but a government error branding him a confederate upset some 
descendants 
it sure is goofed up he was a union man and he was 
fighting the confederates he would have really had a fit said 
wilcoxs greatgranddaughter doris wilcoxbalmer of chicago 
the error on wilcoxs new tombstone was discovered this past 
memorial day by an exsoldier who became suspicious about the 
confederate marker while placing flags on veterans graves at 
prairie view cemetery 
some people bothered by the mistake questioned whether wilcoxs 
history would have been altered permanently had the error not been 
caught the government has already agreed to replace the marker 
this is a rather glaring error said state rep leo 
hamilton whose district includes hallie a wrong date or wrong 
month could occur the wrong army is not too common 
wilcox a corporal in company e of the first wisconsin cavalry 
died in 1899 the government issued a flat marble gravestone to 
honor his civil war service 
over the years the tombstone in the tiny northwestern wisconsin 
village of 1220 people weathered making it difficult to read in 
1986 the cemeterys caretaker ordered a new one from the 
governments monument service according to myron olson chippewa 
county veterans service officer 
erected in 1988 the new marker made of granite and valued at 
83 contained most of the right facts about wilcoxs life born 
feb 8 1827 died oct 7 1899 entered the military nov 2 1864 
released july 29 1865 
but instead of listing the soldier in the us army the 
gravestone put him in the confederate states army olson said 
while putting flags at veterans graves before memorial day 
veterans of foreign wars post 1038 commander jim gustafson spotted 
it figuring something was wrong about a wisconsin man fighting for 
the confederate army 
his curiosity put officials to work including a call to 
hamilton who has since contacted us rep dave obey 
ms wilcoxbalmer said some of her relatives were quite upset by 
the mistake she said the error wasnt caught by the family because 
an aunt who regularly visited the soldiers grave died in early 
1988 just before the new marker was installed 
olson said he could understand if wilcoxs descendants were 
offended 
when you make the kind of sacrifice you do in going to war 
you believe in the side you are fighting on so it is pretty grave 
to be depicted on the other side he said 
george gulas an administrator for the monument service of the 
national cemetery system within the us department of veterans 
affairs called the mistake an honest error that would not 
tarnish wilcoxs contribution to his country 
the clerk processing the order for the engraver probably 
didnt put information in the computer right gulas said in a 
telephone interview from washington dc 
there have been a couple of them before all the clerks arent 
that familiar with the civil war gulas said there are a lot 
of confederates buried in northern states it is not unusual

drug policy director william bennett launched 
a preemptive strike thursday on critics who say more us military 
aid for battling south american cocaine traffickers could entangle 
this country in a vietnamlike war 
increased law enforcement and military assistance for colombia 
peru and bolivia is not an american invasion bennett said in a 
speech to the center for strategic and international studies 
it is not an escalating military intervention bennett said 
but military assistance in all three of the andean nations is 
necessary to achieve a level of security that law enforcement 
personnel alone cannot provide 
bennett stressed that us personnel will not participate in 
antidrug operations 
we will not do it for them they must do it for themselves 
bennett said in response to growing expressions of concern by some 
lawmakers and others that steppedup us military assistance could 
involve american forces in guerrilla fighting 
but he conceded there was a danger that more american lives 
could be lost this is a dangerous enemy and we cannot expect to 
fight this battle unscathed and come out of it unblemished 
when we sent military trainers or drug enforcement 
administration agents or state department personnel to the andean 
region we expose them to certain risks bennett said but we 
need them there to give the governments a fighting chance and 
encourage them to take tough actions of their own 
if we want to help keep drugs out of america then we need to 
support those countries that are working on the front line against 
drugs bennett said 
colombia peru and bolivia are receiving 230 million worth of 
aid for antidrug efforts the bush administration has proposed 
increasing that to 430 million next year 
editorial writers and columnists have questioned whether plans 
to send us military advisers to train latin american forces will 
lead to american involvement in a vietnamstyle war particularly 
in peru where the leftist shining path guerrillas control much of 
the cocaineproducing areas 
on wednesday rep peter kostmayer dpa the acting chairman 
of a house foreign affairs subcommittee said he had grave doubts 
about the militarization of the andean antinarcotics effort 
are we getting the united states involved through the back 
door in fighting guerrilla wars kostmayer said 
bennett conceded that a serious effort against drug 
traffickers in peru will inevitably lead to fighting with the 
leftist shining path guerrillas 
peruvian authorities know that they cannot fight cocaine at 
the source without at the same time providing a measure of security 
from shining path terror bennett said 
bennett said the very mention of military assistance causes 
handwringing among certain members of the press and congress 
who ignore the fact that the cocaine business is a very dirty and 
often deadly business 
if these efforts are caricatured as another vietnam an 
american invasion or involvement in a foreign war then we risk 
crippling a series of strengthened relationships that our president 
and the presidents of the andean region have recently forged 
bennett said

the number of bombings nationwide increased 25 
percent last year as drugrelated bombings almost doubled a 
government report says 
these are largely bombings related to turf wars or 
disagreements within certain factions involved in narcotics 
trafficking said jack killorin a spokesman for the treasury 
departments bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms he was 
referring to the leap in drugrelated bombings 
firearms still are responsible for most drugrelated violence 
killorin acknowledged wednesday but he added nobody at atf 
likes the trend of almost exponential growth in the use of 
explosive devices as a weapon in the drug wars 
drugrelated bombings last year totaled 64 almost double the 33 
in 1988 according to a draft of the atf explosives incidence 
report of 1989 there were only five such attacks in 1987 the 
first year atf counted drugrelated bombings 
in those three years 18 people have been killed in drugrelated 
bombings 13 of them in 1989 the report said in addition 56 
people have been injured 17 of them last year 
i dont think theres any question but the street level of 
activity in narcotics is becoming increasingly violent killorin 
said 
meanwhile the total number of criminal bomb attacks for all 
reasons increased by 25 percent from 1108 in 1988 to 1384 last 
year the 1989 total was 59 percent higher than the 871 in 1985 
adding in attempted bombings last year there were 1699 a 28 
percent increase over the 1332 in 1988 last years total was 54 
percent higher than the 1103 in 1985 
thirtythree people were killed and 305 injured last year in 
bomb attacks since 1985 the number of people killed has ranged 
between 29 and 43 last year represented a high for the number of 
injured which had ranged from 182 to 283 in the previous four 
years 
among motives for bomb attacks drug issues ranked third the 
report says vandalism was first followed by revenge then drug 
disputes labor disputes homicide or suicide protest extortion 
and insurance fraud killorin noted that some bombings had several 
motives 
bombings listed in the report include explosive as well as 
incendiary devices the difference said killorin is the 
difference between a hand grenade and a molotov cocktail the 
numbers cover bombings either investigated by the atf or reported 
to the atf by other law enforcement agencies they do not include 
accidental noncriminal explosions 
the report shows that in addition to last years 64 drugrelated 
bombings there were 17 attempted bombings total drugrelated 
bombings and attempts in the past three years were 81 last year 38 
in 1988 and seven in 1987 the statistics show 
the drugrelated attacks include 11 on detroits north side that 
injured five people and appear to be part of a turf war between 
narcotics trafficking organizations the report says 
attempted bombings included a plot by two st louis drug dealers 
who were angered by the pike county mo sheriffs strict 
enforcement of narcotics laws they allegedly tried to recruit an 
undercover deputy sheriff to help kill his boss 
they decided to blow up the sheriff in his official vehicle to 
set an example for other law enforcement officers in the area 
the report says the two men face state and federal charges

ectopic pregnancies the dangerous development 
of fetuses outside the womb are increasing at epidemic 
proportions with 88000 cases a year federal health experts 
warned thursday 
the national centers for disease control said the estimated 
88000 us cases in 1987 the latest year for which statistics 
are available marks a 19 percent increase in one year and more 
than a doubling in a decade 
the cdc report was issued three days after a study in the 
journal of the american medical association said women who have had 
chlamydia are more than twice as likely as other women to have 
ectopic pregnancies the jama study used 1985 statistics 
chlamydia and other sexually transmitted diseases can cause 
pelvic inflammatory disease in women which is believed to be the 
chief cause of ectopic pregnancies 
if a woman has an infection of the fallopian tubes they can 
become blocked or scarred and the ovum does not get transferred to 
the uterus it implants outside the womb said dr hani atrash 
chief of the pregnancy and infant health branch at the cdc 
pelvic inflammatory disease does not explain all the 
increases he said noting other studies implicating factors such 
as smoking and stress 
ectopic pregnancies have increased about fourfold since 1970 
when national case surveillance began the cdc said the 1970 rate 
was 45 per 1000 reported pregnancies compared with 168 in 1987 
the increases are of epidemic proportions atrash said 
adding that the steady twodecade increase is more than would be 
expected simply from better reporting 
previous studies have reported that the rates are highest for 
women over age 30 and for minority women 
ectopic pregnancies killed 30 american women in 1987 while a 
relatively small number they accounted for a tenth of all maternal 
deaths in this country atrash said 
if detected early ectopic pregnancies can be ended surgically 
ending the danger to the mother

the senate by two votes today upheld 
president bushs veto of a bill to broaden the political rights of 
3 million government workers 
on a 6535 vote lawmakers refused to revise the 51yearold 
hatch act to remove prohibitions on campaign activities for federal 
and postal employees a twothirds majority was needed to enact the 
bill into law over bushs objections 
the vote gave bush an unbroken string of 12 victories in veto 
showdowns with the democraticled congress 
at the white house presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said we are pleased that that vote was sustained we 
felt that it incorrectly politicized the civil service 
the house voted wednesday to override the veto by a 32793 
margin well above the twothirds needed to override bushs veto of 
the bill last friday 
the house had originally passed the bill by a vote of 334 to 87 
the legislation would have allowed federal workers for the 
first time in five decades to attend political conventions and 
caucuses as delegates on their own time and speak at rallies on 
behalf of candidates 
it also would have removed a ban on government workers holding 
offices in local state or national political organizations or 
soliciting donations from coworkers for federal employee and 
postal union political action committees 
the president vetoed the bill last friday saying it would 
inevitably lead to repoliticizing the federal work force and 
destroy its essential political neutrality 
there was no immediate word on whether congressional sponsors 
would seek to write a bill more to the presidents liking 
the bill originally passed the senate on a vote of 6730 bush 
won his veto fight when three original republican supporters 
alfonse damato of new york pete v domenici of new mexico and 
trent lott of mississippi supported his veto 
in addition the white house picked up the support of republican 
sens pete wilson of california and kit bond of missouri both had 
missed the vote in may all 55 senate democrats voted to override 
bushs veto 
just before the vote senate gop leader bob dole of kansas 
issued an appeal to his colleagues to support bush saying 
supporters of the bill wanted only to give more power to federal 
employee unions to raise more money to give to democrats 
he said the law was enacted in 1939 as a remedy to gross 
patronage abuses in the federal government 
the only diffence now is that because of the hatch act these 
abuses are under control he said without it well be right 
back where we started from it probably wont happen overnight but 
it will happen 
sen edward m kennedy dmass a supporter of the bill 
attributed the loss to white house pressure to maintain bushs 
perfect veto record 
i regret that the merits are being overshadowed to extend the 
presidents unbroken string of vetoes kennedy said its time 
to end the secondclass status of federal workers in american 
democracy 
one senior republican ted stevens of alaska who voted for the 
original measure announced he would continue to support the bill 
for the first time i am asking the senate not to sustain the 
veto of this president said stevens its time that our 
federal employees be made firstclass citizens 
it would convert the present rule that partisan 
politicking by federal civil servants is prohibited into a 
presumption that such partisan campaigning should be encouraged 
he said 
stevens said he met with bushs advisers to attempt to forge a 
compromise but was rebuffed by administration officials who he 
said are caught up in the belief that government workers are 
overwhelmingly democrats 
thats just not true stevens said states such as mine 
colorado and california with large federal work forces 
repeatedly elect republicans 
the senate approved the bill by a potentially vetooverriding 
6730 vote in may with unanimous support from the 54 democrats 
since then former rep daniel akaka of hawaii who supports the 
bill has filled a 55th democratic seat in the senate vacated in 
april by the death of sen spark matsunaga 
the closest bush has come to allowing congress to enact a law 
over his objections was last july when 34 senators by a single 
vote upheld his veto of a bill to impose conditions on his sale of 
fsx jet fighter technology to japan 
weve been very lucky bush told a white house audience 
recently we may take one on the chin but generally the

a decision by both german states to guarantee 
polands existing borders is a crushing setback for millions of 
germans who dream of reclaiming their old homelands 
east german lawmakers overwhelmingly approved such a guarantee 
thursday and west german lawmakers were poised to follow suit 
the declarations promise that a united germany will not seek to 
reclaim former lands carved away by the allies after world war ii 
and ceded to poland 
the territories east prussia silesia and pomerania now 
comprise onethird of poland 
while german unity to most of the world is the merger of east 
germany with its western neighbor other germans say it will not be 
complete until those old lands are also returned 
you wouldnt believe how many phone calls we get these days 
said michael lohr a spokesman for the bonn west germanybased 
league of expellees people literally break down on the phone 
crying 
lohrs group is the umbrella for 30 organizations with 2 million 
members who have ties to the former lands they hold gatherings and 
festivals annually to mark their history and regional culture 
despite the resolutions lohr said there was nothing to prevent 
the issue from being raised again after a united german parliament 
is chosen perhaps as early as december 
it cannot be the end because these are not legally binding 
he said 
but it was with a note of finality that west german chancellor 
helmut kohl in a speech to west german supporters reaffirmed his 
grudging support of such a resolution 
there are many people in our country who will be deeply moved 
and distressed by the statement given here today kohl said 
they have strong emotional bonds with the country of their 
forefathers on a day like this they can feel nothing but grief 
hitlers germany invaded poland in september 1939 and under an 
agreement with the soviet union the poland was split down the 
center between the two countries 
six million poles died during the war about half of them were 
polish jews who were exterminated in concentration camps spread 
throughout the country 
after the war the three german areas west of the oderneisse 
river were ceded to poland to compensate for an even larger section 
of eastern poland kept by the soviets 
lohr said an estimated 10 million west germans and about 4 
million east germans trace their roots to the three regions which 
are still home to about 800000 ethnic germans polish and red 
cross estimates of the number of ethnic germans are much lower 
our position was to keep as much of german territory as 
possible and if it wasnt possible to keep any one of these eastern 
provinces we would like to see tougher negotiations he said 
lohr said if the lands cannot be reclaimed he said his group 
wants germans from the region or their heirs to be able to 
reclaim their old property in the region 
he said the resolutions as written would give away these 
territories unconditionally 
the resolutions passed by both parliaments call on poland to 
guarantee the cultural and legal rights of ethnic germans 
kohl who bases much of his political support on elements who 
believe germany has a right to the territories caused a furor for 
months before he finally said in march that he would agree to 
support polands current borders 
the guarantee was demanded by nations victimized by germanys 
history of hunger for other lands it is a symbolic promise the new 
germany will not become like the old one 
the germanpolish border is final said west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher without finality of the 
oderneisse border there will not be peace in europe

president mikhail s gorbachev accused his 
hardline critics of slander thursday and faced the prospect that 
one of them would be elected head of the russian republics 
communist party 
gorbachev was put on the defensive for a third day when a 
leningrad economist claimed he did not obtain party approval to 
switch the soviet union to a market economy 
to consider that this idea and program dropped from the sky 
or that somebody is undertaking an overnight coup to change our 
course that is slander gorbachev told the congress of russian 
communists a nationwide broadcast showed him angrily waving his 
hand in the air as he spoke 
numerous conservatives at the meeting which began tuesday have 
attacked the 59yearold kremlin chiefs political and economic 
reforms the hardliners have indicated they will try to replace 
gorbachev as party leader at a national party congress starting 
july 2 
gorbachev also might have to deal with a conservative party 
leader in russia the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
nearly all the seven candidates announced thursday for first 
secretary of the russian party are conservatives four of them gave 
election speeches and the frontrunner appeared to be ivan 
polozkov one of gorbachevs critics and one of boris yeltsins 
unsuccessful opponents in the race for the presidency of the 
russian republic 
polozkov the 55yearold party chief of the southern russian 
region of krasnodar received the most applause at the urging of 
delegates he was allowed to speak at least three times longer than 
the other three candidates who addressed the delegates 
polozkov has called for strict party discipline condemned 
informal political groups complained tht older party members are 
not respected and cracked down on cooperatives private businesses 
introduced by gorbachev 
in a speech wednesday he blamed the partys falling credibility 
in part on gorbachevs reform program and said the crisis is not 
just in the communist party but above all in its leading bodies 
on thursday polozkov portrayed himself as a moderate intent on 
saving the party from reprisals on the inside from the left and 
right 
he denied he opposed democratic forces or cooperatives 
gorbachev did not comment on the candidates for russian party 
chief but did shoot back at hardliners who accuse him of taking 
the party out of the decisionmaking process he cited numerous 
meetings of the party leadership where officials decided on the 
need for radical economic reform including a market economy 
dont be suspicious that something is being done secretly to 
turn the rails and move the country in the direction of 
capitalism gorbachev said 
these attempts are rotten improper made by people who seek a 
completely different goal from ours which is to find new forms of 
life and make the lives of people better he said 
the audience 2700 delegates to the founding congress of a 
russian communist party applauded briefly 
gorbachev was alluding to a complaint made wednesday by 
prominent conservative yegor ligachev who said gorbachev made 
crucial decisions without consulting the politburo the communist 
partys 12man ruling body 
his complaints underscored conservative concern that gorbachev 
has shifted power from the party to newly elected legislative 
bodies and to the new post of president a title gorbachev holds 
along with national party leader 
the changes mean that gorbachev may now be strong enough to 
remain the soviet leader even if he no longer heads the communist 
party there has been speculation for months that he planned to 
step down from his party post and exercise his power as president 
the 2700 communists of the russian congress will be the 
majority of the 4700 delegates at next months national party 
congress reformers have complained they were bypassed in the 
selection of delegates 
among the other candidates for russian party chief is alexander 
melnikov a hardline communist from siberia who demanded tuesday 
that gorbachev resign as general secretary 
other candidates are valentin kuptsov head of a party central 
committee department oleg shenin party chief of krasnoyarsk oleg 
lobov second secretary of armenias communist party and nikolai 
polovodov a leningrad worker the only known progressive candidate 
is vladimir lysenko a leader of the radical democratic platform 
group

the house today brushed aside lastditch 
delaying efforts and pushed toward what speaker thomas s foley 
said would be this years only vote on a constitutional amendment 
against flag burning 
a tough choice a choice that we would have hoped to have 
avoided said house majority leader richard a gephardt dmo 
who opposes an amendment we simply cannot protect the flag and 
refuse to erode the bill of rights at the same time 
a supreme court decision june 11 threw out a federal law passed 
last year against desecration of the american flag and rekindled 
debate over a constitutional amendment that was sidetracked last 
year 
the proposed amendment would allow the federal government and 
the states to ban burning or other desecration of the american flag 
critics of the amendment expressed increasing confidence that it 
would not win the twothirds support it would need for approval 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel told a hearing of his senate 
judiciary committee that the house is going to defeat this 
amendment 
foley told reporters that whatever happens today is the final 
action 
were not going to go around and around and around and 
around the washington democrat told a morning news conference 
the house voted 231192 to press ahead with five hours of debate 
followed by a vote on the amendment despite appeals for more time 
for lobbying by the american legion the veterans of foreign wars 
and amvets lawmakers said it did not necessarily reflect sentiment 
for the amendment 
emotional appeals to patriotism and warnings against tampering 
with the constitutions guarantee of free speech rang out in the 
chamber as the house debate got under way 
a panoramic picture of the iwo jima memorial showing marines 
hoisting the flag over mount suribachi was brought to the floor 
beside a photo of a flaming flag in central park where the gooks 
and the goons held it up in open rebellion said rep james 
quillen rtenn he afterward defined gooks as people who 
dont care 
are we so fragile as a nation that we cannot rise above such 
cheap tactics as flag burning asked rep david e skaggs 
dcolo what assurance is there that this excision in the bill of 
rights once breached would not lead to others 
foley appeared to rule out a suggestion by senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan even if the house rejected the measure the 
first time around the senate could approve it and send it back 
possibly in modified form 
we will vote today on this matter for the final time this 
session foley told a morning news conference on wednesday he 
said some of the measures supporters had given way to crass 
political opportunism and would hurt their own cause by that 
kind of egregious political snickering 
as the intensity picked up wednesday supporters promised to 
carry on their campaign even if the amendment is defeated on the 
house floor 
if they think this issue goes away on friday they have no 
comprehension of whats going on out there said republican whip 
newt gingrich of georgia and i expect that if we do lose youll 
see more anger and outrage than if we win 
backers and opponents of the amendment said it likely would not 
muster the necessary twothirds margin in the house 
president bush said wednesday in huntsville ala that a 
carefully drawn amendment to make burning of the american flag a 
crime is needed because the flag is a unique symbol 
republicans on capitol hill however grumbled that the white 
house should have done more oneonone lobbying 
democratic leaders have been campaigning against the amendment 
on grounds that it would undermine the constitutional guarantee of 
free speech 
the amendment would allow the federal government and the states 
to ban burning or otherwise desecrating the american flag 
to become part of the constitution the amendment needed 289 
votes in the house and 67 in the senate plus ratification by 38 
state legislatures 
in the senate democratic whip alan cranston of california said 
his count was 54 in favor 29 opposed and 17 on the fence 
meanwhile former federal judge robert bork was testifying today 
before the senate judiciary committee on the proposed amendment 
the house planned six hours of debate followed by a vote on the 
amendment after that the lawmakers planned to vote on a simple 
statute that would ban flag burning 
the amendment was debated heavily last year after the supreme 
court struck down a texas law that banned flag burning but 
lawmakers ultimately passed a law to ban flag burning instead of a 
constitutional amendment 
the supreme court last week declared the statute 
unconstitutional rekindling debate over the constitutional 
amendment 
house debate took on an acid tone wednesday as rep gerald 
solomon rny told critics that in pushing for a quick vote they 
were gagging 10 million veterans through this nation and 
kowtowing to ilk like the communist youth brigade 
democrats objected and solomon eventually apologized the 
remarks were stricken from the record 
the sharp words however underlined the intensity of emotions 
in the house over the issue foley asked about gingrichs remarks 
said some sponsors are concerned apparently about the political 
issue and the political opportunities they think this represents 
i dont think the american people are going to respond 
favorably to that foley said what i dont think they are 
going to appreciate and support is crass political opportunism a 
kind of wringing their hands gleefully and saying this is where we 
are going to clean up 
veterans groups had sought to mount a grassroots lobbying 
campaign for the amendment but were caught off guard by the swift 
move to whisk the bill to the house floor 
we fail to see why it is so necessary to rush this legislation 
to a vote on thursday said walter g hogan national commander 
of the veterans of foreign wars

with m16 rifle fire according to witnesses and independent radio 
reports 
two attackers wore army uniforms and two wore civilian clothes

pascaltrouillot she was not present at the meeting and her office 
had issued no statement by late afternoon

activist jeanmarie montes 
council member serge villard was wounded in the stomach and 
emmanuel mani a member of the socialist national progressive 
party was wounded in the thigh the reports said both were 
hospitalized

armys intentions as haiti moves toward what would be its first 
democratically elected government since independence from france in 
1804 the presidential election is scheduled for september 
it is horrible said rene theodore leader of the haitian 
communist party it doesnt seem the government can cope with the 
situation if the problem is not resolved it is difficult to 
hold elections with serenity 
haitis last indendepently run elections on nov 29 1987 were

stop the crime wave in which 13 people have been killed in 
portauprince since tuesday

the parliament of soviet georgia has decided to 
ignore president mikhail s gorbachevs embargo on lithuania and 
begin trading with the baltic republic tass reported thursday 
another soviet republic moldavia already has taken similar 
action the president of the russian republic boris yeltsin has 
called for an end to the embargo and he has discussed direct trade 
with lithuanian officials 
lithuania declared independence march 11 and gorbachev cut off 
all oil most natural gas and many raw materials shipments to the 
republic to try to force it to back down 
last week under growing domestic pressure to end the economic 
sanctions the soviet government restored 15 percent of the 
republics natural gas needs 
the georgian parliament also recognized the right to 
selfdetermination and the political will of lithuania latvia and 
estonia and all union republics to create truly sovereign states 
said tass the official soviet news agency 
the parliament also expressed readiness to establish direct 
interstate political and economic relations with them 
georgias action supporting the three baltic states came 
wednesday in a special legislative session where the parliament 
created a commission to work on restoring its own independence 
georgia is southeast of the baltics in the caucasus mountains 
while the baltics were occupied by the red army and forcibly 
annexed to the soviet union in 1940 georgia was occupied and lost 
its independence in 1921 
neither georgia nor the three baltic republics has a population 
of more than 6 million 
tass said the georgian parliament also approved a bill allowing 
alternative labor to military service 
avoiding the soviet army draft has become a strong concern in 
many republics partly because of deadly hazing practices 
in addition many young men do not want to be called into action 
to put down domestic ethnic violence or harrass independence 
governments as the army has been called upon to do in recent years

mandela fever now grips boston but what happens 
after the free south africa tshirts sell out and the last chorus 
of we shall overcome is sung 
longtime antiapartheid activists say nelson mandelas oneday 
visit saturday could have a positive effect on a city often wracked 
with racial tensions most recently during the highly publicized 
stuart murder investigation 
but some warn that the ovations and oratory that will greet the 
african national congress leader do not substitute for real change 
either here or in south africa 
boston is mandelas second us stop his itinerary includes a 
stop at the predominantly black madison park high school a 
motorcade through the roxbury section a luncheon at the john f 
kennedy library and a rally on the boston esplanade 
he has a message of making a nonracial society said mel 
king a former state representative and mayoral candidate it 
seems to me it will encourage the people who want to build a 
nonracial community 
mandela released in february after 27 years in prison in south 
africa is on a sixweek tour of 13 countries to raise money for 
anc and encourage countries to keep pressure on the whiteminority 
south african government 
hes a tremendous figure for young people an extraordinary 
opportunity to meet a contemporary hero said margaret burnham 
chairman of the fund for a free south africa 
to many american blacks the 71yearold mandela represents 
what could have been said state rep byron rushing who has 
backed antiapartheid legislation mandela is similar in age to 
what malcolm x or the rev martin luther king jr would have been 
had they lived he noted 
most americans feel a kind of moral leadership vacuum 
everybodys hero is dead heres a live one thats what you see in 
this big ovation rushing said 
rushing however said it would be a mistake to think mandelas 
sudden popularity would translate into domestic changes that is 
a copout things happen because people organize and persevere 
he said 
the significance of the red carpet treatment for mandela lies in 
the implication that for the first time the black community has 
shaped american foreign policy rushing said mandelas is a 
political not spiritual mission he said 
people are trying to make this into a popes visit he said 
its not 
racial conflicts rocked boston during the late 1960s and early 
1970s over courtordered busing to integrate public schools most 
recently tensions were heightened in fall when charles stuart told 
police a black mugger jumped in his car in boston shot his 
pregnant wife dead and wounded him after the white businessman 
apparently committed suicide in january prosecutors said stuart 
himself plotted to kill his wife and concocted the mugger story 
longtime antiapartheid activist richard clapp said mandelas 
visit could be part of a healing process among boston ethnic groups 
this is a person whos a beacon around the world for 
resistance to unjust regimes he said 
but sadiki kambon director of the black community information 
center predicts the majority of people at the madison park school 
and along the motorcade will be black and the majority of those 
attending the esplanade concert featuring paul simon jackson 
browne and bobby mcferrin will be white 
i dont believe his visit is going to affect the racial 
tensions in this city one way or another kambon said 
yet mandelas visit retains deep significance for 
africanamericans 
just his mere presence is an inspiration especially to young 
people kambon said

a soldier with more than seven years service 
and a family to support doesnt want a handout but does need 
adequate severance pay and health benefits as the military scales 
down pentagon advisers said on wednesday 
recent debate over significant reductions in president bushs 
3033billion budget has focused on air force fighter wings army 
divisions navy ships and base closings 
but the pentagons senior enlisted personnel advisers in 
testifying before the senate armed services committee on a bill to 
provide increased and special benefits to those involuntarily 
separated from the military put faces on the reduction numbers 
spouses and even some of the children are becoming uneasy with 
the future outlook army sergeant maj julius w gates told the 
panel on manpower and personnel 
duane bushey master chief petty officer of the navy said the 
overriding concern among enlisted sailors let go after more than 
five years on the job is not an improvement in their education 
benefits but enough separation pay 
at that point theyre looking to survive they want to put 
meat and potatoes on the table most with a family are looking to 
feed the family bushey said 
gates said army personnel are not asking for free handouts or 
welfare but the quality soldiers subject to force reductions want 
some form of separation pay and need some form of transitional 
medical care 
later in the day senate and house democrats introduced 
legislation that will assist the nations communities that have 
been dependent on the defense buildup of the 1980s as they adjust 
to a reduced military spending 
touted by house majority leader rep richard gephardt dmo as 
a plan to move our economy from a cold war footing to a new era 
of vitality the bill would create a highlevel federal office to 
assist defense adjustment provide grants to communities to start 
adjustment planning and require advance notification to 
communities workers and businesses of planned cuts 
the legislation eases the change from a waroriented economy 
to a peace economy rep ron dellums dcalif a member of the 
house armed services committee told reporters 
last month sens john mccain rariz and william cohen 
rmaine introduced legislation that would ease the pain for 
military personnel especially enlisted men and women in uniform 
from the cuts in defense spending 
severe budget constraints and the easing of the soviet threat to 
the west has prompted a loud long call in congress for slashing 
defense spending defense secretary dick cheney argued on tuesday 
that house and senate plans to cut the budget would force layoffs 
of a third of the 31 million military and civilian workers on the 
pentagons payrolls 
the senate bill is a package of severance pay health benefits 
relocation and job counseling for those forced out of the service 
with more than seven years experience and before they are eligible 
for retirement 
the current pentagon system provides separation pay at 10 
percent of annual basic pay times the number of years of service 
for officers who have five or more years of service the amount of 
pay is capped at 30000 
the senate legislation would raise the cap to 83500 
the pentagon on wednesday proposed its own plan that is similar 
to the senate bill but would affect personnel with five years of 
service who are on active duty at the time the bill is enacted 
we have a personnel crisis of nearly unprecedented 
proportions mccain said at the hearing 
army officials told the panel that the service is planning a 
reduction of 20000 soldiers in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
and 35000 soldiers per year after that cuts greater than that 
would force the army to layoff midcareer officers and 
noncommissioned officers 
navy officials said budget cuts in fiscal 1991 will result in a 
reduction of 494 officers and 5207 enlisted personnel however 
the cuts will come through reduced accessions and not involuntary 
separation 
the marine corps said it has no plans for such layoffs while the 
air force did not provide estimates

federal deficit spending totaled 15168 
billion in the first eight months of fiscal 1990 34 percent ahead 
of the overspending pace for the same period a year ago the 
treasury department reported thursday 
deficit spending in may was 4255 billion following a record 
surplus a month earlier during income tax time the department said 
many analysts now believe the deficit could top 200 billion by 
the end of the fiscal year on sept 30 
the imbalance also was well above the 100 billion target set by 
the grammrudman balanced budget law 
this just puts more pressure on congress and the white house 
to come up with a credible budget plan said william v sullivan 
jr money market research director for dean witter reynolds inc 
in new york 
the smoke and mirrors just wont help any more he added 
white house and congressional leaders currently are negotiating 
a package of budget cuts and increased revenues designed to meet 
the 64 billion grammrudman deficit target for fiscal 1991 that 
begins oct 1 
the bush administration budget last january projected the 1990 
deficit to be 1238 billion although officials admit it will be 
revised upward because of the unexpected costs of the savings and 
loan bailout increased interest rates and lessthanexpected 
revenue because of a sluggish economy 
the congressional budget office in march projected the deficit 
at 159 billion 
aprils record surplus of 4252 billion due to a surge in 
income tax payments had followed a record 5334 billion deficit 
in march 
revenues in may totaled 6921 billion down 27 percent from 
the comparable month last year spending on the other hand rose 
159 percent to 11176 
the outlays included 727 billion by the resolution trust 
corp the government agency charged with bailing out the savings 
and loan industry 
revenues for the first eight months of fiscal 1990 totaled 
66713 billion up 41 percent from the same period of 1989 
spending totaled 11176 billion a 159 percent increase over the 
first eight months of the last fiscal year 
the biggest spending categories as usual were the military 
social security and other programs for the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 2556 billion in may and 19242 
billion so far this year it is projected to total 28679 billion 
for the entire fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 2057 billion for the 
month and 15881 billion for the year so far they are projected 
to total 24459 billion for the year 
other hhs payments including medicare and medicaid totaled 
1675 billion during may and 12621 billion thus far they are 
projected to total 19117 billion in fiscal 1990 
interest on the national debt amounted to 2165 billion for the 
month and 16815 billion so far this year it is projected to 
total 25485 billion for the entire year

the pentagon revised its figures again 
thursday on the number of soldiers accidentally wounded by their 
comrades in the panama invasion reducing the number by one it was 
the second time this week it has dropped the count 
on tuesday pentagon spokesman pete williams said 16 out of 310 
soldiers wounded in action were hit by socalled friendly fire 
but williams said thursday that additional study has revealed that 
actually 15 men out of 311 wounded in the invasion were hit that 
way 
on monday the department had said 19 of some 324 soldiers 
wounded in action had been accidentally wounded by their comrades 
williams said a review of videotape taken by an air force ac130 
gunship does show an incident of possible friendly fire involving 
another 21 us army soldiers during the dec 20 military operation 
but the spokesman said it still is impossible to determine 
whether their injuries came from the fire of the gunships cannon 
or mortar fire from the panamanian defense forces 
the video taken at night in the area of the battle for the 
panamanian defense forces headquarters at the commandancia 
doesnt show impact you cant tell a lot from the video 
williams said 
we have been analyzing the tape and continue to do so he 
added 
williams said the pentagon stands by its initial count that two 
and perhaps three us servicemen had been killed by friendly 
fire during the panama operation the third case was still under 
study williams said 
the spokesman said he believed those families that requested to 
know the circumstances of their relatives deaths had been informed 
whether or not if involved friendly fire but some families asked 
not to be given such information 
the pentagons disclosure of the dead and wounded from friendly 
fire was prompted by a newsweek magazine report that nine us 
soldiers had been killed by their comrades and that more than 60 
percent of those wounded had been hit by friendly fire

an aidsinfected doctor who sued johns 
hopkins medical school accused the school thursday of trying to 
block him from delivering a speech at the international aids 
conference 
dr hacib aoun said the school filed an injunction to prevent 
him from delivering a speech that dealt in part with discrimination 
he said he had suffered at the hands of hopkins 
paul rosenberg vice president and general counsel for the johns 
hopkins health system in baltimore said we did in fact seek 
guidance of a court with respect to dr aouns speech he 
responded to aouns charges through a statement released by a 
hopkins spokeswoman 
aoun is a venezuelan doctor who contracted aids in 1983 when a 
tube of a patients blood broke in his hands and cut his finger he 
was then a doctor in training at the johns hopkins hospital 
although hopkins says aoun had distinguished himself in his 
career his contract was not renewed after he was diagnosed with 
aids in 1986 
he filed a lawsuit that led to a bitter confrontation and 
ultimately was settled in december 1987 he did not return to 
hopkins details of the settlement were kept secret as a condition 
of the settlement 
aoun has since lectured and written on the tragedy of aids 
discrimination in a moving speech thursday at the sixth 
international conference on aids he said his experience was a 
nightmare 
we had to sue the hospital to get health benefits he said 
such actions as hopkins attempt to deny benefits send a terrible 
message to health workers he said 
that was the speech that hopkins had attempted to block aoun 
said 
it wasnt to prevent him from speaking rosenberg said we 
actually wanted to see his speech 
last week hopkins officials asked the conferences program 
director dr robert wachter for a copy of aouns speech wachter 
told hopkins he didnt have a copy according to hopkins 
spokeswoman marion glick 
he said the request would have to go to dr aoun glick said 
a judge reviewed the legal filing by hopkins and required aoun 
to slightly modify his speech before delivering it rosenberg said 
hopkins sought a copy of the speech to determine whether aoun 
was violating the secrecy agreement in the lawsuit settlement 
glick said 
we never saw his speech and we dont know what modifications 
were made to his speech said glick the judge did all of 
that 
we have never had any intention to restrict dr aoun from 
discussing policy issues related to aids hiv testing health care 
or benefits for hiv infected persons rosenberg said in his 
statement

us religious leaders on thursday gave 200000 
and a heros welcome to nelson mandela who responded by calling 
them his comrades in arms in the battle to dismantle apartheid 
from a theological perspective i do think that god raises up 
giants of the faith for society and i think this is one that god 
has raised said presiding bishop edmond l browning of the 
episcopal church 
the gathering of more than 100 church leaders representing 
protestant catholic orthodox jewish and muslim groups cheered 
loudly as the 71yearold deputy president of the oncebanned 
african national congress called upon south african leaders to 
confess the sins they have committed 
mandela who was released feb 11 after a 27year imprisonment 
said churches have played a decisive role in the antiapartheid 
fight 
you are our comrades in arms you are our brothers and 
sisters we feel perfectly at home with you mandela told the 
gathering sponsored by the national council of churches the 
nations largest ecumenical organization 
mandela asked church leaders to keep up pressure on the south 
african government referring to economic sanctions as one of the 
prices we are prepared to pay to bring about democratic rule in 
south africa 
in addition to giving 200000 to the anc the religious leaders 
thursday approved a document entitled the new york declaration 
calling for continued support of us government sanctions against 
south africa and for the release of all political prisoners 
i will do everything in terms of my office to influence the 
president said browning the spiritual leader of the 
denomination of which president bush is a member i dont think 
we can remove sanctions until the people of south africa are free 
bush scheduled to meet with mandela next week reiterated 
wednesday that the united states will continue its sanctions until 
south africa meets certain requirements including the release of 
all political prisoners 
bishop john ricard of the archdiocese of baltimore representing 
the us catholic conference said mandelas presence vindicates 
years of church pressure on the south african government including 
the divestment of its own holdings in companies doing business 
there 
i think right now the role of the churches is to help the 
african national congress and mr mandela develop the 
infrastructure that will be needed once apartheid is dismantled 
several moslem and jewish leaders joined to honor the 
antiapartheid leader despite their differing views of mandelas 
support for the palestine liberation organization and his 
comparison of the struggle of palestinians to that of black south 
africans 
we have something in common we cannot separate said dawud 
assad president of the council of masajid of north america to 
us he is a great hero 
mohamed khan president of the islamic congress of the united 
states said the principle that mandela is standing up for is an 
islamic principle equality and justice 
it is also a jewish principle said rabbi alexander schindler 
president of the union of american hebrew congregations 
our faith has always taught us until all human beings are 
free no one is free he said 
schindler who noted the black nationalist leader also has 
supported israels right to exist within secure borders said his 
presence was a symbol of jewish support for mandela and the desire 
of american jews to strengthen their alliance with blacks in the 
fight for civil rights 
the man is an unusual spirit an incandescent spirit in our 
generation he said

a note found near the victim of a predawn 
shooting in central park on thursday may link the attack to a 
zodiac gunman who claimed to have shot three men police said 
a passerby notified police shortly after 5 am that a man had 
been shot in central park the victim described only as a black 
man in his 20s was hospitalized in critical condition with a 
gunshot wound to the chest authorities said 
a note was found nearby said a police source speaking on 
condition of anonymity the notes contents were not revealed but 
the source said it led detectives to believe the zodiac gunman may 
be linked to the manhattan shooting 
all four shootings occurred on thursdays and before dawn 
the gunman in three cryptic notes referring to the signs of the 
zodiac claimed responsibility for three shootings since march 8 
two were in the same brooklyn neighborhood one in an adjoining 
queens neighborhood 
although the gunmans notes indicated he had murdered his 
victims the wounded men two hispanics and a white survived 
detectives found the first note near the body of a man shot on 
may 31 the two other notes were mailed to the new york post and 
the cbss 60 minutes 
the notes began this is the zodiac and contained the phrase 
the twelve sign will die when the belts in the heaven are seen 
police said 
the notes contained accurate descriptions of the victims as 
well as the times dates and places they were shot 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli said that the gunman is not 
believed to be the man who calling himself the zodiac claimed 
responsibility for as many as 40 killings in a series of notes sent 
to san franciscoarea newspapers from 1968 to 1987 
the san francisco zodiac was never captured 
a psychological profile of the new york gunman indicates he is a 
man of limited education with a desperate need for attention he 
probably lives alone or is a loner and may be unemployed the 
police profile suggests

deputy manager of the federal crop insurance corp the agency said 
thursday 
last november cason 35 asked the white house to withdraw his 
nomination as assistant secretary for natural resources and the 
environment

his nomination between president bush and environmentalists who 
were supported by sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee 
opposition was led by the sierra club national wildlife 
federation wilderness society league of conservation voters and 
national audubon society 
the groups alleged casons record in several top interior 
department positions during the reagan administration showed 
favoritism toward development of public lands despite 
environmental concerns

new 79200ayear usda job had strongly supported the nomination 
and had characterized the opposition as both misguided and 
unfair

nato leaders will consider practical ways of 
building a new order to guarantee peace in europe at next months 
summit an alliance official said thursday 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said that as the western 
alliance moved away from a strategy based on confrontation with the 
warsaw pact it would seek to include the soviet union as a full 
partner in the new order 
the july 56 summit of nato leaders in london comes at a time 
when the alliance is seeking to change its role to reflect the 
rapid moves toward german unification and the relaxing of eastwest 
tensions following the democratic upheaval in the soviet bloc 
woerner told the anglo american press association of paris that 
new security arrangements for europe had to be developed within 
existing institutions such as the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the european community 
but he also called for an increased role for the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe csce which 
includes the united states the soviet union canada and east and 
central european countries 
woerner said the nato leaders at their summit would discuss 
setting up within the csce framework a verification center for arms 
control and a crisis solution center 
woerner also said there could be more regular meetings of the 
csce foreign ministers and heads of government and the 
establishment of a small secretariat the csce process was 
established at a meeting in helsinki finland in 1975 
asked whether he thought a european security council should be 
established as part of this process woerner said he thought such a 
body might be set up later after european nations had some 
experience with the kinds of problems that developed 
he said there was no need for any european code of conduct 
because it was already contained in the agreement that emerged from 
the helsinki conference the 1975 helsinki accords covered military 
security economic cooperation and human rights issues 
we have to make the helsinki agreement a binding 
commitment he said we are all too tempted to speak about 
institutions when it is more important to emphasize human 
rights freedom of expression protection of minorities the rule 
of law 
woerner a former west german defense minister said it was 
vital for a unified germany to be a full member of nato and its 
integrated military structure but with special arrangements to 
cover soviet security concerns 
he said the soviets had been offered a lot of tangible security 
guarantees to drop their opposition to a unified germany being a 
member of nato 
there is no reason for them to feel threatened woerner 
said the soviet union needs partners and friends where else 
better to find them than in a satisfied peaceful stable europe 
he said developments the past year in the soviet union and 
eastern europe had reduced the threat of surprise conventional or 
nuclear attack by the soviets on nato members 
but he said the western military alliance still was necessary 
because of the risk of instability in the soviet union which 
remains the main military power on the eurasian landmass 
in reply to a question woerner said there was no need to extend 
natos area of operations to include such areas as the middle east 
although its members had cooperated there on an individual basis 
during the iraniraq war he said there had been no request that 
nato consider playing a role in the middle east

the supreme court ordered an end to political 
patronage thursday ruling that federal state and local government 
jobs generally may not be awarded based on party affiliation 
the justices by a 54 vote said constitutionally protected 
rights are violated when people are denied government jobs 
promotions or transfers because of politically partisan reasons 
the decision reinstates a lawsuit by three illinois residents 
against gov james thompson and the states other republican 
leaders the suit says thompson has made party allegiance a 
requirement for 68000 state jobs 
while the ruling applies to all levels of government city and 
county governments may feel the biggest impact because most federal 
and state government jobs are covered by civil service merit 
systems that have made patronage obsolete 
only puerto rico filed a friendofthecourt brief to defend 
use of a patronage system 
were delighted said robert h chanin a lawyer who 
represented the national education association in urging the 
justices to stamp out patronage 
chanin predicted little impact for federal jobs but added it 
will have an impact at the state level there are probably 40 
states that have some type of comprehensive merit system but 
perhaps as many as 10 states and puerto rico dont have such 
systems or have slippage in their merit systems they rely 
primarily on what amounts to a patronage system 
our general gut reaction is that the most impact will be in 
local governments among county and municipal employers he 
said it could affect a great number of jobs 
the high court said partisanship may play a role in deciding who 
gets a government job only when political affiliation is an 
appropriate requirement such as for highlevel policy advisers 
in a landmark 1976 ruling and a 1980 sequel the high court 
significantly weakened political patronage sometimes called the 
spoils system 
those rulings prohibited government employers from firing anyone 
even some policymaking and confidential government workers 
solely because of their political affiliation unless party loyalty 
is a requirement for effective performance 
but those decisions dealt only with firings before thursday 
the court never had said that partisanship could not play a role in 
hiring transfers and promotions as well 
to the victor belongs the spoils that may be constitutionally 
obtained justice william j brennan wrote for the court 
the first amendment prevents the government except in the 
most compelling circumstances from wielding its power to interfere 
with its employees freedom to believe and associate or to not 
believe and not associate he said 
the constitutions first amendment protects freedom of speech 
and association 
brennan was joined by justices byron r white thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
anthony m kennedy and sandra day oconnor dissented 
scalia wrote for the four the court simply refuses to 
acknowledge the link between patronage and party discipline and 
between that and party success 
it is selfevident scalia added that eliminating 
patronage will significantly undermine party discipline and that 
as party discipline wanes so will the strength of the twoparty 
system 
the court also struck down government bosses patronage powers 
in laying off and rehiring public employees 
a federal appeals court had upheld the illinois patronage policy 
in hiring transfers and promotions but banned such considerations 
in layoffs and rehirings it said layoffs are too similar to 
firings 
in the illinois case two men and a woman who said their job 
status suffered because they did not vote in republican primaries 
or give money to the party sued the governor the state gop and the 
heads of several state agencies 
cynthia rutan said she had repeatedly been denied promotions to 
supervisory positions in the state rehabilitative services 
department because she did not support republican candidates 
franklin taylor an equipment operator said he had been denied 
an illinois transportation department transfer to another county 
because party officials opposed the move 
james moore said the state corrections department has refused to 
hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key gop 
leaders 
the three sued for more than 1 billion in damages their suit 
also seeks to shift control of the state employment system to a 
courtappointed federal receiver 
lawyers for thompson and state gop leaders had argued that 
hiring political allies stimulates good government because the 
employee is likely to appreciate the job and in turn serve the 
public well 
in other decisions the court 
ruled 54 in a case from kansas and missouri that states and 
consumers may not sue over alleged price fixing by energy producers 
ruled 63 in a chicago case that evidence obtained by police in 
a warrantless search of a home may be used in court if the officers 
were admitted by someone they reasonably but mistakenly believed 
had the authority to consent to the search 
reinstated a former high school wrestling coachs 15yearold 
libel lawsuit against an ohio newspaper 
the court said the allegedly libelous statements could be 
treated as assertions of fact not opinion but its 72 ruling did 
not appear to reduce significantly the freespeech protections 
courts traditionally have given to statements of opinion

the senate failed by two votes on thursday to 
override president bushs veto of a bill to broaden the political 
rights of millions of government workers 
the 6535 vote on the hatch act two short of the twothirds 
majority needed to override marked the 12th time in 12 tries that 
bush has prevailed over congress in veto confrontations 
three republicans who originally voted for the bill switched 
sides to support bush on the veto vote all 55 senate democrats 
voted to override the veto 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we are 
pleased that that vote was sustained we felt that it incorrectly 
politicized the civil service 
the president vetoed the bill last friday saying it would 
inevitably lead to repoliticizing the federal work force and 
destroy its essential political neutrality 
the house with nearly half of its republicans bolting the 
administration voted 32793 on wednesday to override bushs veto 
the legislation would have allowed 3 million federal and postal 
workers to on their own time attend political conventions and 
caucuses as delegates and to speak at rallies on behalf of 
candidates 
it also would have removed a ban on federal workers holding 
offices in local state or national political organizations or from 
soliciting donations from coworkers for federal employee and 
postal union political action committees 
the workers would still have been prohibited from taking leaves 
of absence to seek elected public office or soliciting campaign 
contributions from the general public or on behalf of a specific 
candidate 
one sponsor sen david pryor dark said after the vote he 
would try to extend the hatch act prohibitions on political 
activity for federal workers to presidential appointees 
senate gop leaders portrayed the bill during the debate on 
override as an electionyear bonanza for democrats 
democrats want to get this bill passed before this election 
said minority leader bob dole of kansas he said federal employee 
and postal union political action committees funneled 88 percent of 
their campaign contributions in the 1988 election to democrats 
the pac heads of the letter carriers and others unions want 
more power to raise more money to give to democrats dole said 
thats how it works around here money is power 
vincent sombrotto president of the 315000member letter 
carriers union said bushs strongarm tactics to get 
republicans to switch their votes places him in the same league 
as the worlds most oppressive dictators 
thirteen republicans had joined senate democrats in passing the 
bill by a potentially vetooverriding 6730 majority in may sens 
alfonse damato of new york pete v domenici of new mexico and 
trent lott of mississippi switched thursday to support bushs veto 
it would subject employees to subtle coercion to join 
associations and to contribute and i dont think most federal 
employees want to be solicited by campaign organizations or pacs 
said domenici 
the white house also gained the support of republican sens pete 
wilson of california and kit bond of missouri both had missed the 
vote in may along with one democrat 
democrats attributed the loss to white house pressure on 
republicans to maintain bushs perfect record of overpowering 
congress in veto showdowns in his first 17 months in office 
all of us regret that the merits of this struggle were 
overshadowed by partisan appeals to preserve the presidents 
unbroken string of consecutive vetoes sustained by congress said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass 
pryor said he planned to immediately seek to extend hatch act 
prohibitions on campaigning to the hundreds of white house staff 
employees and presidential political appointees now exempt from the 
law 
the government secretary who types letters should have at 
least the same rights as the secretary of labor for whom she 
works pryor said noting cabinet members frequently appear as 
draws at political fundraisers 
that federal employee who cannot stuff envelopes on his own 
volition can in effect now be required to write a partisan 
political speech for his boss the agency head pryor said

poor weather has sharply reduced this years 
production of both tart and sweet cherries the agriculture 
department said thursday 
production of tart cherries is expected to be down 19 percent 
from the 1989 harvest to an estimated 224 million pounds that 
would also be 5 percent less than the droughtdamaged 1988 harvest 
in michigan the largest producer tart cherry production is 
expected to be down 8 percent from last year and 3 percent below 
the 1988 crop the department said 
unseasonably warm weather in march got the crop off to a fast 
start the report said however temperatures dropped and were 
below normal through much of april and may 
the cold wet weather during bloom discouraged bee activity 
which caused poor pollination and a poor set of fruit it said 
high winds took many blossoms off the trees 
major states were forecast at colorado 1 million pounds up 
from 500000 last year michigan 175 million down from 190 
million new york 20 million down from 31 million oregon 7 
million down from 15 million pennsylvania 3 million down from 6 
million utah 14 million down from 24 million and wisconsin 38 
million down from 82 million 
the crop of sweet cherries was forecast at 152000 tons down 22 
percent from 1989 and 18 percent below the 1988 harvest 
department officials say sweet cherry production in the western 
states is mostly quoted by the ton while eastern practice favors 
pounds since most production is in the west the agency reports 
sweet cherries in tons 
sweet cherry production forecasts were reported for california 
17000 ton down from 26000 last year idaho 2000 down from 
2700 michigan 20000 down from 25000 montana 275 up from

the nuclear regulatory commission has agreed 
to end controls on the disposal of some lowlevel radioactive 
wastes and materials at nuclear plants hospitals and laboratories 
officials said thursday 
the revised policy scheduled to be announced next week is 
likely to prompt a flood of requests from producers of such wastes 
that they be allowed to dispose of them the same way as 
conventional garbage 
the commission has been grappling for years with a revision of 
federal requirements for lowlevel radioactive wastes and 
materials currently all such items must be given special handling 
and may be discarded only in special waste disposasl facilities 
but according to sources in environmental organizations and on 
the commission staff who spoke on condition that their names not be 
used a majority of the five commissioners agreed in recent weeks 
that wastes emitting radiation below a certain level should no 
longer be regulated by the agency 
the commissioners approved the revised policy by indicating 
approval on the policy document socalled notation voting and 
planned no formal vote in an open meeting agency officials said 
joe fouchard a commission spokesman confirmed that a majority 
of the commission had approved the new policy and that details 
would be announced next week he said the policy would establish a 
procedure to consider requests to exempt wastes from federal 
controls but provided no figures on what the cutoff would be 
in early 1989 the commission proposed that any radioactive 
wastes exposing a person to no more than 10 millirems per year 
should be exempt from special treatment requirements the electric 
utility industry has proposed exempting materials emitting twice 
that amount 
a chest xray from modern apparatus could be expected to yield 
an exposure of about 20 millirems typical exposures in the united 
states from background radiation including cosmic rays and 
radioactive rocks are about 200 millirems to 300 millirems per

jonathan becker who has followed the issue for public citizen 
a washingtonbased environmental and consumer group said that the 
revised policy would allow as much as a third of the lowlevel 
radioactive wastes to be dumped into conventional landfills and 
through normal sewer systems 
these efforts to deregulate the disposal of nuclear wastes 
illustrates the nrcs and the nuclear industrys inability to 
dispose of their radioactive garbage in a safe sensible manner 
said becker 
he estimated that the nuclear industry hospitals and 
laboratories could to save 82 million a year because of reduced 
disposal costs 
the utility and nuclear industries have argued that radiation 
from these wastes is too low to pose a health threat the 
associated risks if any are quite small compared to other actual 
risks an individual faces every day john j kerney a member of

major suppliers like the united states and the 
soviet union have seen the value of their arms sales to third world 
clients drop more than 50 percent in recent years according to a 
new study by congressional research service 
the total value of arms deals with the third world was 293 
billion in 1989 down from 614 billion in the peak year 1982 
said the study by the congressional agency a copy of the study was 
made available to the associated press this week 
saudi arabia and iraq have been by a wide margin the top third 
world arms buyers from 1982 to 1989 accounting for 146 percent 
and 141 percent respectively of the weapons transfers 
the united states accounted for 26 percent of the arms sales 
agreements with the third world but its total deals fell from 93 
billion in 1988 to 77 billion last year 
the us figures only include governmenttogovernment sales 
agreements excluding commercial sales for which the data is 
incomplete the report said but this exclusion does not affect the 
united states ranking among other arms suppliers it added 
the value of us commercial arms deliveries in fiscal 1989 fell 
to 161 billion from 33 billion the previous fiscal year 
according to state department figures 
the congressional research service study said france suffered a 
massive decline in its arms sales agreements which dropped from 
32 billion in 1988 to 300 million last year west germany on 
the other hand increased its sales from 83 million in 1988 to 
nearly 13 billion in 1989 
the report attributed the decline to several factors third 
world clients are still absorbing massive arms deliveries they 
ordered in the 1970s and 1980s and arent buying expensive new 
weapons their purchases in recent years have included a greater 
proportion of spare parts and ammunition less costly than 
aircraft tanks or ships 
secondly many third world countries are burdened by heavy debt 
and unwilling or unable to buy as many weapons as they did even 
oilrich nations have cut back on some arms purchases as oil prices 
have dropped 
also the end of the 8year iraniraq war in 1988 has reduced 
orders from the two combatants which accounted for a large part of 
the massive increase in arms sales in the early and mid1980s the 
study found 
the value of soviet arms deals which accounted for 384 percent 
of the weapons transfers to the third world fell from 147 
billion in 1988 to 112 billion in 1989 
in addition to a drop in demand the decline in soviet arms 
sales could also reflect a kremlin decision to cut back its support 
for third world clients who cannot pay in hard cash 
still in 1989 the soviets were the major supplier to eight of 
the 10 top third world arms recipients the study said they were 
afghanistan angola vietnam syria iraq libya cuba and india 
irans major supplier was china while saudi arabias was britain 
arms deals with afghanistan more than tripled from 1982 to 1989 
to 86 billion angola and vietnam increased their arms purchase 
agreements 37 percent and 12 percent respectively in the same 
period 
syrias purchases declined 564 percent iraqs were down 434 
percent and libyas fell 303 percent the report said 
india posted a massive increase in the value of arms deliveries 
up from 68 billion in the period 198285 to 13 billion in 
198689 the report said 
its author richard grimmett noted that the decline of 
eastwest tensions and the resulting cuts in defense spending by 
the worlds major powers could increase competition among arms 
manufacturers to sell to the third world to compensate for lost 
domestic markets

the agriculture department announced plans 
thursday to prepare an environmental impact statement on the 
control of mediterranean fruit flies 
it was a signal that usda is digging in for the long haul in a 
war against the medfly a pest that poses a threat to the nations 
commercial fruit and vegetables 
if established on the us mainland agricultural losses of 
over 800 million annually could result the announcement said 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said his agency is cooperating in 
two medfly eradication programs in california and florida 
but he said aerial application of bait laced with the pesticide 
malathion has met with considerable public demand for environmental 
analysis especially in california 
glosser said that medfly control is emergency in nature and must 
be implemented quickly when an infestation is found thus he said 
it is important that an environmental statement be prepared so it 
will be in place for future medfly eradication programs 
as a first step the agency is asking for comments from the 
public government agencies and the private industry about issues 
that should be addressed in the statement he said after review 
usda will schedule public meetings to gather fuirther comment 
the comments can be submitted by aug 21 an original and three

senators on an antiterrorism commission 
announced legislation thursday to appoint security managers at 
highrisk airports and to require a system for notifying passengers 
of terrorist threats 
the measure goes beyond bush administration proposals for 
dealing with air terrorism but sponsors said they expected 
unanimous support for the actions originally proposed by the 
presidential commission that looked into the bombing of pan am 
flight 103 
representatives of some relatives of victims of the december 
1988 bombing over lockerbie scotland said they support the 
legislation which is to be introduced friday but a lawyer for 
another relatives group said it falls far short of what is needed 
the lockerbie bombing blamed on unidentified terrorists killed 
all 259 people aboard the londonnew york flight and 11 people on 
the ground 
its essential that we proceed said sen frank lautenberg 
dnj a member of the nowdefunct presidential commission the 
terrorists are not giving up and we cant either 
it can no longer be business as usual with the faa federal 
aviation administration and the airlines lautenberg told a news 
conference on the capitol lawn 
lautenberg and fellow commission members sen alfonse damato 
rny and rep james oberstar dminn all said they expected 
strong bipartisan support and bush administration backing for the 
bill which is subject to change as it moves through congress 
the senate bill to be matched by a similar house measure next 
week would give special faa managers responsibility for security 
at airports where terrorists are considered likely to operate 
it also would require the faa and the fbi to assess the security 
threat to domestic airports and set up security screening of mail 
and cargo 
the bill would prohibit selective notification of government 
employees when there is a threat and would order that guidelines be 
set up for notifying the public when there is a credible threat 
against a flight 
george williams representing one group of victims relatives 
told the news conference the bill would cover most relatives 
concerns and he added god speed this legislation 
michael lemov a washington lawyer representing a rival 
relatives group told reporters before the news conference that the 
legislation fails to create a public oversight board recommended by 
family members and sets up too many hurdles before the public can 
be notified of a threat 
lemov said congress should create a separate agency to handle 
the aviation terrorist threat 
transportation secretary samuel skinner and faa administrator 
james busey announced several initial steps to meet commission 
recommendations last week including the appointment of top 
officials in the department to oversee aviation security 
skinner at a speech thursday said he expects to submit to 
president bush a full response to the commission report in july

the senate armed services committee approved 
on thursday three of president bushs nominees to top defense 
posts including the choice of lt gen carl w stiner to head the 
special operations command 
by a vote of 120 the panel sent to the full senate the 
nomination of gen michael j dugan as air force chief of staff 
adm frank b kelso as chief of naval operations and the selection 
of stiner 
the senate is expected to approve the choices without dissent 
the nomination of stiner got caught up in a debate between 
congress and the defense department over the role of special 
operations in intelligence gathering and civilian oversight of the 
elite unit formed in april 1987 
it may well be that this senator feels that that issue is 
going to have to be resolved prior to such time as this committee 
completes the work on your nomination sen john warner of 
virginia ranking republican on the armed services committee said 
last month at stiners confirmation hearing 
warner and sen sam nunn dga chairman of the panel also 
expressed concerns about a proposal calling for elimination of 
civilian oversight of intelligence activities by special operations 
gen james j lindsay commander of the special operations 
command made the proposal in a memorandum to gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
in a telephone interview thursday warner said he raised his 
concerns over the participation of the head of special operations 
in intelligence gathering and the issue has now been resolved 
i spent a considerable amount of time analyzing this 
nomination not only in terms of the individual but the general 
oversight of this important and vital segment of security forces 
warner said 
the republican senator also sought and received a letter 
from powell describing the reasons for stiners nomination 
in the end warner joined with other lawmakers in voting for the 
nomination

a federal judge thursday dismissed a 26yearold 
skyjacking case against a man who argued the cia ordered him to 
hijack the plane to cuba as a cover to infiltrate that nations 
intelligence service 
reinaldo lopezlima ended up spending 24 years in cuban prisons 
before he was released and returned to the united states in 1987 
for two years he lived quietly outside washington dc ignored 
by federal prosecutors but then was arrested on a 1969 indictment 
in the case 
us district judge kenneth ryskamp ruled the government failed 
to give the 50yearold defendant a speedy trial 
i believe the governments conduct in this case can only be 
described as draconian ryskamp said its puzzling to the 
court why it is pursuing this 
the judge noted cuba offered to return lopezlima in 1972 but 
the us government refused 
the defendant said he was thrilled to end his long ordeal but 
worried the immigration and naturalization service will move to 
deport him 
im very happy im going to celebrate tonight he said 
after the ruling the only thing im afraid of now is that the 
ins will take some action against me 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office said 
prosecutors will decide in a few weeks if they will appeal the 
dismissal 
according to the indictment lopezlima and enrique castillo 
hernandez held a gun to pilot richard lee wright and forced him to 
fly to cuba from key west in a small plane in february 1964 
the plan lopezlima said was to convince castros government 
that he and hernandez were cia defectors once inside cuba they 
were supposed to assist anticastro forces 
lopezlima and hernandez landed in cuba but failed to win the 
cubans confidence and wound up in jail lopezlima stayed in 
castros prisons and work camps for 24 years hernandez was 
imprisoned for 16 years before returning to miami in the 1980 
mariel boatlift he was later slain 
lopezlima won a major victory in a pretrial hearing two weeks 
ago when ryskamp allowed him to introduce evidence of his cia 
connections and the agencys authorization for operations that 
included hijackings 
the judge cited a 1955 national security order that gave broad 
powers to the cia including the right to break us laws that 
order was repealed in 1981 
ryskamp also said lopezlima made a good case of why he should 
be allowed to testify that he was working for the cia when he 
hijacked the plane 
according to cia records the people named in lopezlimas court 
documents as having sanctioned the hijacking worked for the cia at 
the time ryskamp said 
the government conceded lopezlimas cia contacts were valid but 
said he wasnt instructed to hijack a plane to cuba because his 
contacts had no authority to give such an order

world business leaders told president bush on 
thursday that the main aim of next months sevencountry summit 
should be to ensure a successful end in december to four years of 
global negotiations on trade 
the longterm talks among 100 countries are known as the 
uruguay round they are stalled by a deadlock between the 
united states and the 12 governments of the european economic 
community over cutting subsidies on farm products these subsidies 
cost taxpayers and consumers in the united states and other 
industrial countries an estimated 245 billion a year 
i think he bush accepts that the deadlock should be broken 
in houston said joseph e connor chairman of price waterhouse 
world firm and a leader of the group that went to the white house 
at least that was the message we were trying to convey to him 
that if it is not broken then there is hardly time for the 
governments to conclude the round in december and we do 
believe the round must conclude in december 
bush meets in houston texas july 9 to 11 with the leaders of 
japan west germany britain france italy canada and the 
europoean group 
the reagan and bush administrations have insisted on a pledge 
eventually to get rid of farm subsidies that directly affect world 
trade the europeans want a deal on all kinds of support for farm 
products 
the negotiations also aim at accords on other important issues 
including the trade in services from air travel to zoo keeping 
services now provide more jobs in the united states and other 
advanced countries than traditional manufacturing 
governments must be under no illusion that without 
substantial and substantive liberalization of market access and 
reform of the multilateral rules which govern world trade and their 
extension to new areas business will simply not consider the 
uruguay round a success said the statement given to bush

political observers question whether 
the us supreme courts ruling on patronage hiring in illinois 
would succeed in uprooting the old rule to the victor belong the 
spoils 
the court cleared the way for trial of a federal lawsuit filed 
on behalf of three illinois residents who claimed that a patronage 
system run by republican gov james r thompsons administration 
had prevented them from being hired promoted or transferred in 
state jobs 
in the past thompson has acknowledged giving preference to 
republicans in state hiring when choosing among equally qualified 
candidates he maintains the practice ensures that his policies are 
carried out 
after thursdays ruling he denied the lawsuits claims and 
declared that the matter will have to be settled in court 
i think this will strike a severe blow at whatever is left of 
political parties in america he said 
mary lee leahy a lawyer and democratic party activist who filed 
the lawsuit said the ruling would free state employees from 
concerns about how their political activity or lack of it would 
affect their jobs 
the patronage system just isnt going to be certainly not as 
we know it she said the average state employee is going to be 
free to do or not do what he or she wishes politically 
but other observers were skeptical about the rulings potential 
impact 
paul green a professor of political science at governors state 
university in university park said a smart politician will 
always find a way to get around any procedure that the court or the 
legislature will place upon him 
he added this will just make it a little more difficult to 
put your people in 
officials in other states poohpoohed the possible effects too 
andrew crane executive director of the massachusetts ethics 
commission said there is not a consensus about whether 
patronage is appropriate or not many people have said its 
inappropriate many other people say what is wrong with hiring 
political supporters if they are qualified for the job 
illinois labor officials noted that the union contract covering 
state employees bars consideration of political factors in 
promotion but enforcement depends on employees willingness to 
blow the whistle on violations 
unless there is someone there to protest its still going to 
continue to go on said henry bayer associate director of 
illinois council 31 of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees 
a total of 68268 employees are under the governors control 
according to the state comptrollers office both parties in 
illinois have a long track record of political hiring 
when you go back to the first governors of illinois the first 
mayors patronage has played an important role green said 
in cook county which includes chicago a consent decree to bar 
politically motivated hiring has been in effect since 1979 the ban 
is known as the shakman decree after chicago lawyer michael 
shakman who challenged the patronage system operated under the 
late chicago mayor richard j daley 
but political observers say the shakman decree effectively 
locked in many of the patronage workers who were installed in 
government jobs by the countys democratic organization before the 
decree took effect 
to some extent you might have a situation where people would 
be protected in their current jobs and that might hurt a future 
administration since thompson has had the chance to make these 
appointments for 14 years said david everson a political 
scientist at sangamon state university in springfield

a former bingo lobbyist testified 
thursday that he gave 32000 in cash to gov ned mcwherters 1986 
campaign and thousands more to state legislators debating changes 
in the law 
james v long testifying in the federal conspiracy and gambling 
trial of democratic state rep tommy burnett and two codefendants 
said he didnt disclose the gifts as required by state law 
long testifying under a plea bargain was the governments 
first major witness 
mcwherter who was speaker of the tennessee house when the gifts 
were allegedly made was vacationing in florida and unavailable to 
comment said spokesman ken renner 
renner said a quick review of the democratic governors 
financial disclosure records showed long contributed less than 
4000 to mcwherters gubernatorial campaign however the 
spokesman didnt rule out the possibility long may have concealed 
some donations 
burnett 47 is charged in a 10count indictment with illegal 
gambling conspiracy mail fraud and perjury his codefendants 
knoxville bingo operator virginia hurst and columbia businessman 
ee shutt are accused of illegal gambling and conspiracy 
long said the cash gifts ranged from 6000 to democratic state 
sen jim lewis to 100 to 200 to democratic lt gov john wilder

came through normal proper channels 
jim long said he gave me 6000 no lewis said he gave 
me 400 at a fundraiser i was selling 100 tickets and he bought 
four 
jim long did buy my supper occasionally and jim long had given 
me at one time maybe 500 aside from the 400 at another 
fundraiser but thats the most he gave me lewis said

of the sentences to run simultaneously

quick treatment with the drug azt in the 
earliest stages of aids infection can significantly slow the lethal 
disease according to research presented thursday at the sixth 
international conference on aids 
the study appears to provide the strongest evidence yet that 
early intervention can stall the emergence of aids in people 
infected with hiv the aids virus 
we have to come to the conclusion that the greatest advantage 
has to accrue with early intervention said dr margaret fischl 
it has to occur as early as possible in hiv infection 
fischl a researcher at the university of miami pioneered the 
use of azt in people who already have aids however most infected 
people are still outwardly healthy so fischl and other teams 
around the country have been exploring the risks and advantages of 
giving the medicine before aids infection reaches its final stages 
the conference opened wednesday amid angry protests by thousands 
of demonstrators frustrated over the slow pace of progress in 
controlling the disease 
the demonstrations continued thursday as several hundred 
protesters marched by government offices in san franciscos civic 
center about 50 protesters were arrested after they blocked a busy 
intersection 
another group rushed into the lobby of a building housing the 
state insurance commissioner but left a short time later without 
incident 
fischls recommendation is likely to be controversial during 
the past year some researchers have begun to question whether azt 
the only approved aids drug should be reserved for use during the 
later stages of the disease 
the medicine interferes with the reproduction of hiv when given 
to people with aids the drug loses its punch within two or three 
years as the virus becomes resistant to it 
some doctors believe that if given early in the disease azt 
will be powerless to slow the disease once aids develops 
fischls conclusions were based on patients who were infected 
with hiv but had not developed any major symptoms of aids two 
hundred received placebos for a year and then switched to azt for 
eight more months two hundred fiftyone others took azt for the 
entire period 
she found that significantly fewer progressed to aids if they 
got the drug without delay 
several other reports presented thursday focused on how the 
infection is transmitted 
dr nancy padian of the university of california san francisco 
found that women who have sex with aidsinfected men are 12 times 
more likely to catch the virus than are men who are sexually 
exposed to infected women 
her research based on 58 male sex partners of infected women 
and 269 women partners of infected men supports the widely held 
belief that the virus spreads more efficiently from men to 
women than from women to men 
during her study only one man caught the virus from his female 
sex partner this couple reported having intercourse without 
condoms more than 1000 times over seven years 
among other research presented 
dr rachel royce of the university of california berkeley 
reported circumstantial evidence that cigarette smoking may speed 
up the development of aids in people who are already infected with 
hiv 
the study based on 1000 infected gay men found that smokers 
were almost twice as likely as nonsmokers to develop aids or die 
over 4 years 
hivinfected mothers run a high risk of passing the virus to 
their babies before birth now a soviet study has found that 
infected babies can also pose a hazard to their uninfected mothers 
dr irina kuznetsova from the central research institute of 
epidemiology in moscow reported on babies who got infected from 
contaminated needles in hospitals they found that 11 of 18 women 
who breastfed their infected babies contracted the virus they 
attributed this to cracks in the mothers nipples that allowed the 
virus to enter their bodies 
dr tom peterman from the us centers for disease control 
reported that bisexuality appears to be an important source of aids 
infection in the army 
he and army researchers reviewed 43 soldiers who developed aids 
infections twentyone admitted to highrisk activities and of 
these 18 said they had sexual contact with other men most of these 
men had sex with women as well

the state department in a followup to 
president bushs suspension of the us dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization thursday urged americans traveling to the 
middle east and elsewhere to exercise extra caution 
deputy spokesman richard boucher attributed the advisory to 
rising tensions in the area but said he was not aware of any 
specific threats 
he said it was possible that the tension might increase as a 
result of bushs announcement but he stressed that there were other 
reasons for the warning as well 
he recalled that on may 31 the day after the abortive attack by 
the palestine liberation front on beaches near tel aviv the 
department had said it was concerned about tensions in the region 
and that terrorists had threatened to attack american citizens or 
interests

none of our customers want it i think the recall really 
frightened people said mark schachern manager of the washington 
square bar and grill in san francisco 
some distributors and industry officials say perrier has 
received a tepid reception from hotels and restaurants since it was 
reintroduced in the united states in late april the return 
included a 25 million advertising campaign and such publicity 
events as a giveaway of cases of the familiar pearshaped bottles 
in new yorks central park and rockefeller center 
theres still a certain amount of reluctance on the part of 
many hotels and restaurants said hellen berry of beverage 
marketing corp an industry trade group many customers are 
happy with whats been substituted 
perrier group of america inc based in greenwich conn said 
it had no concrete sales figures for the year but company 
spokeswoman jane lazgin said we are right on target for where we 
should be at this time 
lazgin admitted that the response from restaurants since the 
reintroduction hasnt been what the company hoped it would be 
we are working hard to regain our accounts but it wont be a 
quick fix we have a lot of work to do she said 
experts say perrier probably has done better at recapturing lost 
shelf space in supermarkets because it was able to offer its other 
brands poland spring calistoga and arrowhead as alternatives 
perrier distributors agree but admit that many customers still 
are reluctant to take perrier back 
the pepsicola buffalo bottling corp in buffalo ny a 
perrier distributor is sending its salespeople to supermarkets it 
once served in the buffalo area to help boost customer confidence 
we feel we owe it to them to meet face to face and explain 
that its ok to take perrier back said manager scott pastor 
pastor said his perrier customers now number less than the 800 
restaurants and supermarkets he had before the recall but he 
declined to be specific or release recent sales figures 
source perrier sa recalled its water from worldwide distribution 
after tests showed traces of naturally occurring benzene a 
cancercausing chemical in its product in several countries the 
contamination stemmed from improper filtration of the water the 
company said 
its absence from the american market was a blow to perrier 
which built the us sparkling mineral water market nearly from 
scratch in the 1970s said berry of the industry group 
in 1989 perrier posted us sales of 102 million that 
accounted for 44 percent of the industrys 23 billion in us 
sales 
the company has put the cost of the recall at 78 million 
berry said competitors took advantage of perriers absence to 
increase their own market share 
were in places we never were before said sandy klinzman a 
spokeswoman for evian waters of france which also is the parent 
company of saratoga bottled mineral water klinzman claimed sales 
of evian and saratoga water increased dramatically this year but 
declined to release any figures 
anytime you have a major player like perrier gone everyone 
benefits she said 
there are about 450 water bottling plants in the united states 
producing more than 600 different labels of drinking water natural 
water and spring water according to bevmark inc a los 
angelesbased consulting firm in addition there are about 50 
brands of imported waters bevmark said

bush administration officials and 
congressional leaders ended budget negotiations for the week 
thursday with both sides saying they had accomplished little 
what im fearful of is were in some kind of stalemate said 
sen pete domenici of new mexico one of the republican 
negotiators as the sixth week of the closeddoor sessions ended 
the 507 billion deficitreduction package that the white house 
presented on wednesday the first proposal of the talks went over 
badly with democrats 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo called it 
deficient house budget committee chairman leon panetta 
dcalif called it inadequate 
and it prompted chairman james sasser dtenn of the senate 
budget committee to distribute an analysis that called it a 
fiscal morning of the living dead that was a reference to the 
plans similarity to the rejected budget president bush presented 
in january 
were in a negotiation white house budget chief richard 
darman said of the democratic criticisms everybody understands 
that 
during two bargaining sessions thursday democrats attacked the 
latest white house plan and administration officials defended it 
but democrats did not offer a proposal of their own and some of 
them insisted that the administration come back with a more serious 
proposal 
the ball lies semideflated in the presidents court said 
sasser 
the administration plan claims 444 billion in savings over five 
years it relies heavily on cuts in benefit programs like medicare 
democrats say more savings are needed and argue that deeper 
reductions in defense are needed

poland named kazimierz dziewanowski a 
longtime opposition journalist as its new ambassador to the united 
states on wednesday the state news agency reported 
dziewanowski 59 was assistant editor of soldaritys weekly 
newspaper tygodnik solidarnosc in 1981 when the weekly was edited 
by tadeusz mazowiecki now polands prime minister 
the ambassadordesignate also participated in talks in 1989 that 
led to the legalization of solidarity and the holding of largely 
democratic elections in poland 
president wojciech jaruzelski nominated dziewanowski to the 
post according to the pap news agency 
dziewanowski succeeds jan kinast who has served as ambassador 
to washington since march 1988 when poland and the united states 
restored full diplomatic relations following a fiveyear 
interruption 
dziewanowski said in an interview wednesday evening that he 
expects to take up his post sometime in midjuly 
i think it is very important to try to change the image of our 
embassy in washington because it was not a very good image i am 
not for making any accusations but it was so and now we would 
like to change it he said 
he said he planned to work in two directions to improve polands 
image 
the first is american public opinion congress mass media 
intellectual circles and so on and the second is with americans 
of polish descent 
we would like very much to get into close contact with them 
and to help to improve things which were done very badly in the 
last 40 years this is very important he said 
dziewanowski joked that he was a little daunted by the 
assignment 
if you would like to know the truth i would say that between 
the vistula and the potomac you could hardly find another man as 
frightened as i am now this is a very important job 
but he added that along with other new appointees to the embassy 
staff he expected to be able to improve polands image

an earthquake shattered northern iran 
early thursday killing at least 25000 people and injuring tens of 
thousands iranian officials announced 
the quake shortly after midnight thursday demolished scores of 
villages and towns and buried thousands of people in their homes 
the iranian mission to the united nations which released the 
casualty toll said it would likely rise further as rescuers 
reached more remote areas 
the earthquake was at least as bad as the quake registering 77 
on the richter scale that struck iran on sept 16 1978 killing at 
least 25000 people 
the temblor measured 73 on the richter scale of ground motion 
the geophysics center at tehran university said the us 
geological survey however measured it at 77 
at least a dozen aftershocks shook the region within two hours 
after the quake the earthquake struck at 1230 am and was 
centered 125 miles northwest of tehran near the caspian sea the 
official news agency irna reported 
it shook buildings and shattered windows in tehran but 
apparently caused no deaths in the capital in the neighboring 
soviet republic of azerbaijan the temblor slightly damaged some 
older buildings in baku but caused no casualties the soviet news 
agency tass said 
the iranian ambassador to the united nations kamal kharrazi 
told cable news network that iran badly needs medical equipment 
blood blankets and medicine i understand that international 
organizations are trying their best to bring some of this equipment 
and medicine 
scenes shown on state television and monitored in cyprus showed 
young men frantically clawing at debris from flattened concrete 
buildings in rasht 175 miles northwest of tehran with a population 
of 189000 people 
occasionally they carried away someone on a stretcher 
bulldozers and cranes lifted away larger pieces of debris 
earlier thursday a statement by the iranian cabinet said the 
sad painful and horrible tragedy has so far claimed 10000 lives 
and left thousands of others wounded 
the announcement carried by the islamic republic news agency 
placed all government organizations on full alert and ordered 
an air bridge set up between tehran and the stricken areas to 
evacuate survivors 
landslides blocked rescuers on the ground and bad weather 
hindered helicopters trying to airlift supplies and victims irna 
said 
many people remained buried in the debris it said and several 
hundred revolutionary guards were flown from tehran after nighfall 
to join rescue teams 
irans spiritual leader ali khamenei called the disaster a 
divine test and urged the bereaved residents of the stricken 
provinces to pass this test with pride through patience and 
cooperation 
more than half of those killed and injured thursday were in 
zanjan province the secondhardest hit was gilan province irna 
said in dispatches monitored in cyprus 
the victims included at least 1000 people killed in one village 
in zanjan province abdar the news agency said also killed were 
768 people in qazvin just 80 miles northwest of tehran 
in zanjan alone 73 villages and towns were affected irna said 
many were leveled 
irna said the quake triggered landslides that blocked main roads 
dozens of rescue vehicles including trucks carrying food 
supplies and ambulances were stuck on the roads it said 
telephone lines and electricity and water supplies were cut in 
zanjan and gilan which have a combined population of 27 million 
communications with tehran from the outside world also were 
difficult 
in abdar the televison showed mountains of rubble which a 
speaker said were all that was left of apartment buildings they 
appeared to have been shaken off their foundations collapsing like 
a deck of cards 
the camera zoomed in on a stuffed rabbit and a shoe lying in a 
street carpeted with dust 
women in black chadors flanked by weeping children camped out in 
public squares afraid to return to their homes in case of 
aftershocks 
a dam south of rasht burst flooding the surrounding area irna 
said 
hospitals appealed for blood donations and helicopters and 
transport planes delivered thousands of tents and blankets they 
also carried rice tea sugar cheeses and canned food to the area 
irna said 
three usmade c130 transport planes shuttled between tehran 
and rasht to carry the injured to hospitals in the capital it 
said staterun iran air ordered special flights to carry the 
injured 
khamenei and president hashemi rafsanjani flew to the area to 
supervise relief operations rafsanjani declared three days of 
mourning and ordered all state agencies to be ready to provide help 
the united states offered humanitarian assistance to iran and 
president bush sent a message of condolence to rafsanjani the 
message was delivered to iran by another unidentified country 
since the united states does not have diplomatic relations with 
tehran 
the region is prone to earthquakes a quake registering 69 on 
the richter scale struck nearby soviet armenia on dec 7 1988 
killing 25000 people 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude a reading of 7 on the scale indicates a major 
earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage eight is a great 
quake capable of tremendous damage

a man faces an extradition hearing after 
being charged with kidnapping in the 1987 disappearance of a 
9yearold girl whose mother forced a grand jury investigation 
david c phelps 26 a longtime suspect in the case was 
arrested in perry iowa on wednesday night special prosecutor 
james d smith said thursday phelps a former norfolk resident 
was indicted tuesday 
as far as im concerned the grand jury was somewhat 
conservative but i understand why said joyce cutshall whose 
daughter jill remains missing 
but it means there will be a trial and everything that 
happened to jill should and will i feel be told in the end of 
it 
jill disappeared aug 13 1987 from this northeast nebraska 
prairie city about 110 miles northwest of omaha she had been 
waiting alone on the steps of her baby sitters home in norfolk 
her clothes were found in a wildlife area three months later 
the case attracted national attention including a report on 
cbss 60 minutes thousands of fliers with jills picture have 
been distributed throughout north america 
frustrated by what she considered lax police work ms cutshall 
began a petition drive and forced a grand jury investigation 
under state law a court is required to convene a grand jury if 
presented with petitions from at least 10 percent of the countys 
voters who participated in the last gubernatorial election ms 
cutshall needed 1024 signatures and collected 1471 
a madison county grand jury began work april 30 
phelps was being held in the dallas county jail in adel pending 
an extradition hearing which may be held as soon as monday smith 
said bond was set at 100000 
in an interview thursday ms cutshall said she is 99 percent 
sure that her daughter is dead but hoped the indictment and a 
trial would lead to further investigation into her daughters 
whereabouts 
its a daily thought for me i know jill is very very near to 
me within a 20mile radius of me and knowing that there are 
people who know where she is at and i dont is becoming very very 
frustrating she said 
ms cutshall said has no doubt that her petition effort was 
worth it 
in retrospect a couple of months ago i looked back at what i 
did and i was kind of surprised i was real surprised she 
said 
she said it was the only thing she could do for her missing 
daughter 
that was my last avenue my last road to take she said 
a private investigator who has worked on the case for two years 
promised to continue to search for jill 
this means the fight has just now really started said roy 
stephens director of investigations for the omahabased missing 
youth foundation

a truckload of dog biscuits from california 
arrived wednesday at the statehouse in a protest of what critics 
call substandard commercial dog kennels in kansas 
more than 100 protesters gathered at the capitol steps as the 
yellow rented truck with a sign reading no more puppy mills on 
the side pulled up 
we have brought a message to the governor and state attorney 
general of kansas said organizer ellen katzman of sonora 
calif as she opened the back of the truck each box of dog 
biscuits in the truck was stamped with no more puppy mills 
we will not tolerate any more sick dogs coming into california 
pet shops from the state of kansas she said 
anytime you ship a sick puppy to the state of california you 
ship grief and you ship heartache she told the crowd 
puppy mills is the term used by animalrights activists for 
commercial kennels that ship sick dogs and cats to outofstate pet 
stores 
california animalrights activists war of words with gov mike 
hayden and attorney general bob stephan escalated last week when 
stephan said the complaints about socalled puppy mills in kansas 
were coming from bozos from california 
stephan said tuesday the issues were being obscured by the 
rhetoric 
i accept part of the blame for this because i spoke in 
anger he told a news conference 
he also obtained a search warrant for a kennel that he said was 
not up to state standards but denied that the crackdown was 
prompted by the protests from california 
delivery of the 40 boxes of dog biscuits was prompted partly by 
a kansas law passed this year that spells out penalties for people 
who trespass on animal research facilities to take pictures 
the californians say the law protects puppy mills but stephan 
says it does not apply to commercial kennels

the three major networks which have steadily 
lost audiences to cable since 1980 released a cbs study thursday 
that shows viewers in four cities stay tuned to network tv 2 times 
longer than to cable 
the reaction from a leading cable industry group was immediate 
i think theyre trying to discredit cable as a growing and 
important source of programming for viewers said robert alter 
president of the cable television advertising bureau 
made public by the new network television association the study 
of primetime viewing in the week of nov 612 last year was based 
in part on nielsen data from 702 homes in new york los angeles 
chicago and philadelphia 
the study analyzed viewing of the three networks fox 
broadcasting and six major cable networks the usa network the 
family channel espn mtv and ted turners cable news network and 
tbs superstation in atlanta 
it found that viewers including those with remotecontrol 
channel switchers some call zappers are apt to change cable 
channels almost three times more than they do network channels 
i think zapping is a fact of life but it happens a lot 
less on network television than on cable thats what the study 
shows said tom delaney cbs director of marketing research 
he spoke at a news conference held by the network association 
formed by cbs nbc and abc in april to represent them in their 
battle to keep viewers and advertisers from defecting to cable and 
independent stations 
cbs fourcity study said that uninterrupted viewing of networks 
averages 27 minutes per tunein compared to 19 minutes for fox 
stations and 11 minutes for cable 
the study will be sent to advertisers in a bid to convince them 
that their commercials are more likely to be seen on the networks 
the studys release comes as advertisers prepare for socalled 
upfront buying of television time for next season with advance 
purchases of network time expected to reach 4 billion 
the networks will be competing with cable for advertisers in the 
upfront market and thats really the impetus of the release of 
that study said alter he said cable has become a major player 
in that market 
four years ago it earned 40 million in preseason sales he 
said last year he added the figure was 500 million and this 
year will be a record upfront for cable with 750 million to 
800 million in sales projected

plo leaders said thursday the united states 
was hostile to palestinians and urged arab action against 
washingtons suspension of the usplo dialogue 
a statement by the plo executive committee said president bushs 
decision will encourage israel to pursue its repressive practices 
against the palestinian people and increase their crimes and 
massacres in the ocupied territories 
the dialogue was a step forward on the road to peace and its 
suspension will reduce the us role in the middle east peace 
process the statement said 
the statement was the palestine liberation organizations first 
official response to bushs announcement wednesday that the 
18monthold talks had been suspended 
it was issued after a meeting of the 15member executive council 
in baghdad the iraqi capitalm called to discuss developments on 
the palestinian issue and the formation of a new rightwing israeli 
government 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir praised bushs 
action and urged the united states to end the dialogue permanently 
bush said he suspended the talks because the plo did not 
forcefully condemn an unsuccessful may 30 seaborne terrorist attack 
against israel 
in their statement the plo leaders said us middle east policy 
reflected a total bias in favor of israel which constitutes 
a major challenge to the arabs 
arabs are required to face up to the american challenge and to 
implement resolutions adopted at the last arab summit conference in 
baghdad last month it said 
that was a reference to summit resolutions calling on arab 
states to reevaluate their political and economic relations with 
other countries on the basis of their policies toward the 
palestinians 
the usplo dialogue began after plo chairman yasser arafat met 
longstanding us conditions for talks by renouncing terrorism and 
accepting israels right to exist since then the us ambassador 
to tunisia has met regularly with plo officials at the 
organizations headquarters in tunis 
bush had urged arafat to condemn the seaborne assault and 
discipline the plo faction that sent the two speedboats filled with 
fighters to a tel aviv beach the boats were intercepted by israeli 
soldiers who killed four guerrillas and arrested 12 there were no 
israeli casualties 
the attack was carried out by the palestine liberation front led 
by mohammed abbas better known as abul abbas who planned the 1985 
hijacking of the achille lauro cruise liner in a disabled american 
was killed 
arafat denied plo responsibility for the seaborne raid the 
executive committee said the movement remained committed to 
arafats december 1988 renunciation of terrorism and that there was 
no evidence abbas group planned to attack civilian targets 
bush called the plo response was not sufficient but said 
the united states was prepared to resume the dialogue immediately 
if the plo condemned the raid and disciplined abbas 
in its latest statement the plo executive committee reiterated 
its earlier position on the may 30 raid it said only the palestine 
national council or parliamentinexile which elects the 
executive committee could decide whether to expel abbas 
the palestinian leadership had taken a responsible and clear 
stand on the coast operation the committee said in its fivepage 
statement but despite that the us administration took the 
decision to break off the dialogue uncovering its true hostile 
policies toward the palestinian people 
this is clear evidence that israel and its branches inside the 
american administration still control the decisionmaking process 
the plo leaders expressed surprise that washington was making an 
issue of an attempted raid in which no israelis were hurt while 
it maintains silence toward israeli crimes against palestinians 
in the israelioccupied west bank masked palestinians chanting 
no to america marched through cities thursday to protest the 
us decision 
in annexed arab east jerusalem stonethrowing palestinian women 
and masked youths clashed with riot police after an arab was killed 
there in an earlier protest over the us decision 
shamir said washingtons determination to fight terrorism would 
not be clear until it cuts its dialogue with the plo permanently 
i hope that the suspension will not be temporary but instead 
will open a new chapter in relations between the united states and 
the middle east shamir said on israel radio 
israel objects to any plo involvement in peace efforts claiming 
the organization is a terrorist group bent on destroying the jewish 
state

the earthquake that devastated iran early 
thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep 
in fragile homes built on flood plains an earthquake expert said 
most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something 
falling on top of you said russ needham a geophysist with the 
us geological survey that monitors ground motion around the world 
the quake hit at 1230 am in iran when most of the people 
were in their homes needham said thursday in a telephone interview 
from golden colo 
at least 25000 people died and thousands were injured in the 
quake which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of 
people in the rubble of their homes iranian officials said 
needham said most structures in that area are built of a 
ceramictype brick or adobe that collapses easily 
its very similar to what we had in armenia he said of the 
dec 7 1988 earthquake that killed about 25000 people 
a soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of 
fatalities on shoddily built buildings 
the armenian quake was measured at 69 on the richter scale but 
thursdays earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 77 
the shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of 
coastal iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain 
of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows 
structures to collapse he said 
the 77magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that 
area where two major plates of the earths crust meet needhams 
said 
iran is in a very active seismic region he said and that 
there have been many smaller quakes 
twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in 
iran during the last 30 years needhams said 
a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake capable 
of widespread heavy damage in populated areas

environmentalists expressed concern thursday 
that the bush administration would fail to give enough protection 
to the rare spotted owl when it announces its plans friday under 
the endangered species act 
i think the forest service is under incredible pressure to do 
less than the right thing said frances hunt of the national 
wildlife federation 
the us fish and wildlife service has set an announcement for 
friday on its plans for protecting the spotted owl 
a decision to make the rare twofoottall brownish bird a 
threatened species could close millions of acres of forest in 
northern california oregon and washington to logging at a 
potential cost of tens of thousands of jobs 
such a decision widely predicted by environmentalists 
industry officials and members of congress would make it illegal 
to harm any of the estimated 3000 to 5000 pairs of surviving owls 
or destroy their critical habitat without government approval 
the announcement is expected to cap a bruising battle between 
environmentalists who favor maximum protection for the owl and the 
timber industry fearful for its own future the actual plans for 
protecting the owl are expected to be drawn up by the forest 
service and other government agencies 
white house deputy press secretary stephen hart said that if the 
owl is declared threatened the white house will monitor the 
development of plans to protect it our goal is that the plan be 
balanced between protecting the owl and saving jobs hart said 
environmentalists call the decision as an important precedent in 
a larger fight over protection of the northwests oldest forests 
because the forest service earlier decided the health of the owl is 
a good indicator of the overall condition of the forests themselves 
the decision has been expected since a panel of government 
scientists announced in april that current forest management plans 
are inadequate to ensure the spotted owl will survive the next 100 
years 
the scientific committee led by forest service biologist jack 
ward thomas determined the owl has lost about twothirds of its 
habitat since 1800 it recommended more than 3 million acres of 
previously unprotected forests an area nearly as large as the 
state of connecticut be set aside to save the owl from extinction 
the controversy continued as the formal announcement neared 
my sense is that the listing will raise as many questions 
as it answers in terms of the immediate implications of what people 
are supposed to do said mark rey of the industrys american 
forest resource alliance 
a fish and wildlife spokesman phil million said the formal 
documents are in the possession of agency director john turner he 
declined to comment on whether it had been reviewed by white house 
staff 
somebody said it is over 400 pages he said 
six northwest congressman asked president bush last week to 
delay the anticipated listings effective date until oct 1 so the 
industry and federal agencies would have time to sort out the 
ramifications of the ruling 
but environmentalists said such a delay would undercut efforts 
to protect the owl 
our fear basically is that would allow business as usual to 
continue for the next few months that would result in the loss of 
important spotted owl habitat said ms hunt 
a delay seems inconsistent with what the endangered species 
act is trying to do said bill reffalt of the wilderness 
society

they can see it now campaign commercials 
spawned by the flag debate aimed straight at them 
it begins said sen bill bradley dnj with an opponent 
saying the issue is not patriotism but judgment then comes the 
graphic 30second commercial featuring an unsavory bearded 
lowlife burning a flag and clearly implying that a particular 
senator is less than patriotic because he chose to preserve freedom 
over a constitutional amendment said bradley a runaway favorite 
for reelection nonetheless concerned about the impact of his 
decision to oppose an amendment against flag burning 
the 30second tv spot can cut both ways said rep f james 
sensenbrenner jr rwis and one of the leading house supporters 
of the amendment in thursdays debate i can see some liberal pr 
man starting a 30second spot with the bill of rights going up in 
flames 
those political worries and more like them underlie the debate 
about the flag and the constitution and they are arguments the 
house could not settle with its vote thursday against an amendment 
to permit laws against flag burning 
the roll call was 254177 a majority but 34 short of the 
twothirds required but senate advocates of an amendment already 
had vowed to force a vote there pointless legislatively but not 
politically it takes twothirds in each house of congress to send 
a proposed amendment to the states for ratification 
the speaker of the house rep thomas s foley dwash said 
the amendment vote on thursday would be the last in that branch 
were not going to go around and around and around and around 
he said 
but the issue has ever since the supreme court ruled just a 
year ago that flag burning was permissible under the first 
amendment to the constitution that invalidated 48 state laws 
against it and ignited the debate president bush pushed an 
amendment and congressional democrats passed a law forbidding flag 
burning instead the court overturned that this month and the 
amendment was revived 
the 1990 replay never had quite the emotional impetus of the 
1989 original even though a gallup poll this month showed 
twothirds of the public in favor of a constitutional ban on flag 
burning 
looking at those numbers republican campaign strategists figure 
they have an issue that will last rep newt gingrich rga the 
minority whip said it was not an issue that would go away soon he 
said if an amendment isnt sent to the states 38 would have to 
ratify in 1990 it will come up again next year that way he 
said republican congressional candidates who favor an amendment 
could demand that their opponents announce positions on a 
flagprotection amendment in the next session of congress 
i dont think this debate is going to end gingrich said 
thursday shortly before the amendment was turned down i am 
confident that this debate is going to go on for a long time 
democratic opponents called republican tactics the politics of 
fear and intimidation and said voters will see through it 
but that is more hope than assurance nobody is certain how the 
issue will play in the campaign ahead 
thats why the debate has been waged on two levels 
one is about the flag the court the constitution and freedom 
of speech 
the other as bradley said is about pure politics 
because it is wary democrats provided a fallback insurance 
vote on another measure this one to ban flag burning intended to 
incite violence the court already has overturned one federal 
statute and the outlook for this one would be dubious 
but the bill and a companion measure in the senate nonetheless 
give opponents of the amendment a way to vote for flag protection 
a vote they can tell their constituents about

the united states offered humanitarian aid to 
iran on thursday and expressed sadness over the loss of life in the 
earthquake that struck the northern part of the country 
us officials said the offer was not intended as a political 
signal to iran but was a gesture of support for the victims said 
iranian officials to include more than 25000 dead and tens of 
thousands injured 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said iran has 
contacted the un disaster relief office to ask for assistance 
the united states has not had diplomatic relations with iran for 
10 years and holds that country partially responsible for the 
continued detention of american hostages by proiranian elements in 
lebanon 
the us offer of assistance was to have been relayed to iranian 
authorities by the swiss embassy in tehran which handles us 
interests in iran 
as of late thursday us officials said that because of the 
time difference they had no confirmation the offer had actually 
been delivered to iranian authorities in any case they said no 
response had been received from the iranian government 
the officials said a us offer of aid following a previous 
natural disaster in iran was turned down 
we are saddened by the damage and the loss of life said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater he said a message of 
condolence had been sent to president hashemi rafsanjani

federal health officials said thursday they cant 
explain the return of encephalitis to central california last year 
after reports of such viral infections had virtually 
disappeared 
an outbreak of st louis encephalitis a mosquitotransmitted 
arbovirus caused 28 cases between august and october in the lower 
san joaquin valley of california the national centers for disease 
control reported 
during the 1970s and 1980s reports of these arboviral 
infections had virtually disappeared from the central valley the 
cdc said the reasons for the disappearance and subsequent 
recurrence are unclear 
especially perplexing was the absence of cases of western 
equine encephalitis which is transmitted in the west by the same 
mosquito the cdc added 
encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain nationwide the 
cdc reported 108 cases of various types of arboviral encephalitis 
last year other types include eastern equine encephalitis and la 
crosse encephalitis

federal health officials estimated thursday that 
4000 infants each year become chronically infected with hepatitis 
b virus because their mothers are infected at the time of delivery 
more than 90 percent of such perinatally acquired 
infections can be prevented through treatment and vaccination as 
soon as possible after birth the centers for disease control said 
in its weekly report 
transmission from mothers to infants at birth is one of the 
most efficient modes of spread of hepatitis b the cdc said 
out of some 10000 expectant women seen at atlantas grady 
memorial hospital between july 1988 and june 1989 85 were positive 
for hepatitis b the cdc reported 
health education efforts must be directed at hepatitis b 
positive mothers to emphasize the importance of hepatitis b 
prevention the cdc said 
the cdc in 1988 recommended hepatitis testing for all pregnant 
women and immediate vaccinations if needed for their babies it 
is estimated that 25 percent of the infants who become chronic 
hepatitis b carriers will die of liver cancer or cirrhosis 
hepatitis b transmitted chiefly via blood is one of the two 
most common forms of hepatitis a serious inflammation of the 
liver some 25000 cases occur each year in the united states

nearly 3 percent of people tested in one survey 
showed signs of infection with viruses that prompted a crackdown on 
imported research monkeys earlier this year government health 
officials reported thursday 
the 25 3 percent is higher than we thought it would be 
said dr kenneth herrmann of the division of viral diseases at the 
centers for disease control 
blood tests for infection with filoviruses the family of 
viruses that includes the deadly ebola virus were conducted in 
the wake of an ebolalike outbreak in research monkeys imported 
from the philippines to virginia pennsylvania and texas last 
winter 
at least 42 people exposed to such monkeys have now tested 
positive for infection with filovirus the cdc said thursday but 
where filoviruses such as ebola and marburg virus have killed 
hundreds in outbreaks in africa and europe no such illness has 
been reported this time in the united states 
out of 449 random adult blood tests 12 or 27 percent were 
positive for previous antibodies against filovirus the cdc said 
the tests were conducted among outpatients at primarycare health 
facilities 
the 12 positive results are unexplained but suggest that 
there may be other agents filoviruses or other viruses that 
crossreact with the filovirus that were concerned about in the 
monkeys herrmann said 
the cdc earlier this year pulled the registrations of three of 
the nations largest monkey importers and imposed new restrictions 
after the outbreak in groups of animals in virginia and 
pennsylvania

fifty aids activists were arrested thursday 
after a march that wound by government office buildings to protest 
what demonstrators said was government inaction in the prevention 
and treatment of aids 
the second day of demonstrations held in response to the sixth 
international aids conference ended when a small group of 
activists sat down in a busy intersection after setting fire to a 
pile of placards 
after issuing a warning police in riot gear surrounded the 
group and arrested protesters on charges of remaining at the scene 
of an unlawful assembly 
eighty people were arrested on wednesday near the moscone 
center the site of the aids conference 
thursdays protests which took place about a mile from the aids 
conference focused on complaints over lack of government funding 
and programs in the san francisco area speakers criticized 
reliance on the socalled san francisco model a system of 
volunteer programs praised and studied as a model for aids patients 
demonstrators carried signs reading san francisco aids model 
built on a fault and replicas of dollar bills with bloody hand 
prints 
the san francisco model was developed by people who care but 
they are being overwhelmed said harvey maurer a member of the 
citys aidsarc vigil 
jean harris a legislative aide to city supervisor harry britt 
criticized city officials for relying on volunteers rather than 
developing and funding programs for early prevention and treatment 
of aids patients 
we are dying and the people up there havent gotten off their 
butts she said as the march stopped outside city hall 
outside the department of public health bonnie ferguson whose 
group prevention point distributes clean hypodermic needles to 
addicts complained the program has received little other than 
praise from mayor art agnos 
arts been kind to prevention point in his public statements 
but we have not been able to get one sterile cotton ball or one 
alcohol prep out of him she said 
the marchers blocked another intersection by a state office 
building for a time passing dollar bill posters back and forth to 
symbolize what they said has been a case of passing the buck by 
local state and federal officials 
a small group ran into the lobby of the building that houses the 
state insurance commissioners office to protest what they said was 
a lack of state action on insurance discrimination against aids 
patients 
they left a short time later without incident

aids educators are alarmed by reports that 
homosexual and bisexual men are lapsing back into sexual behavior 
that could kill them 
at the sixth international aids conference on thursday several 
programs were announced to help the gay community avoid a second 
even larger wave of deadly infection 
almost 20 percent of gay and bisexual men surveyed had abandoned 
safesex practices at least once according to studies being 
presented to the sixth international aids conference by researchers 
from the center for aids prevention studies at the university of 
californiasan francisco 
ten years into the epidemic educators say they are facing a 
community increasingly weary with the burden of maintaining the 
massive changes in their lifestyle a community grieving for the 
carefree days forever lost 
people changed because they were scared to death said 
maggie reinfeld of the gay mens health crisis in new york which 
has created the nations first program for confronting the relapse 
problem safer sex gets a lot tougher when you have to live with 
it over your whole life fear turns into denial because nobody can 
live their whole life in dread of a disease 
the american foundation for aids research announced it has 
awarded in opposition party the leftleaning social 
democrats criticized the treaty saying it fails to adequately 
protect east germans who face economic hardship in the transition 
from socialism to a free market 
but their chairman hansjochen vogel told the bundestag a 
majority would approve the treaty failure to do so would be too 
much of a shock to east german expectations and could lead to 
uncontrollable developments he said 
the leftist greens party argued against passage saying the 
treaty would not bring the two germanys closer together but would 
create newer and deeper forms of division by making east germany a 
dependent institution 
some experts predict up to 2 million east germans could lose 
their jobs as outmoded governmentowned factories and businesses 
try to compete more than a third of the enterprises are expected 
to close and there are fears of social unrest 
the economic merger treaty comes after months of work following 
the collapse late last year of east germanys communist government 
and the opening of the berlin wall east germany elected a 
noncommunist government in march 
kohl acknowledge recognition of polands current western border 
was painful for many germans 
nonetheless he said either we affirm the present boundary 
or we lose the chance of german unity

the environmental protection agency will take 
over evaluation of health risks at all superfund hazardous waste 
sites because industry is underestimating risks too often 
according to an agency report to congress released thursday 
in addition the agency said it will require all regional 
offices to consult headquarters if they want to simply contain 
waste on a site rather than treat it or remove it 
the superfund subcommittee of the senate environment and public 
works committee chaired by sen frank lautenberg dnj had 
requested the report primarily to examine whether 
industryfinanced cleanups were using containment generally easier 
than other actions more than they should 
the first concern is that there continues to be substantial 
inconsistency in the calculation of risks including assumptions 
used such as landuse scenarios and routes of exposure and in how 
the data is organized and presented epas report said 
some risk assessments prepared by private parties tend to 
underestimate the risk posed by a site in many cases requiring a 
redraft by the epas regional office it said 
the risk assessments primarily try to estimate health dangers 
from the site before cleanup but increasingly they are being used 
to estimate what risks would remain after various cleanup options 
lautenberg praised epas decision to take over the assessment 
work rather than leave it in the hands of whoever is conducting 
the cleanup epa states or private industry 
thats where youre really calculating where the cleanup has 
to go whats the risk to people in the communities we ought not 
to leave that to parties responsible for pollution in the first 
place he said 
in terms of cleanup decisions at a given site epa found the 
study did not demonstrate great differences in remedies selected 
by the federal government or the polluter 
we found reasons based on differences in the sites rather than 
differences in who was doing the cleanup said bruce diamond 
director of epas office of waste programs enforcement at a 
hearing of lautenbergs subcommittee 
among those disagreeing with his interpretation were lautenberg 
and several environmental groups 
generally speaking where the government finances the 
investigative cleanup study cleanups use treatment at a higher 
rate than where responsible parties pick up the tab lautenberg 
said 
donald strait of the natural resources defense council said the 
overall treatment rate is 71 percent where government pays for 
cleanup studies compared with 61 percent when industry picks up 
the tab 
joel s hirschhorn president of the consulting firm 
envirosearcheast who studied superfund in detail when he was an 
analyst with the congressional office of technology assessment 
said the different interpretations arose from different 
definitions for example he said epa counts treatment technology 
whenever it is used but only counts land disposal or containment 
when it is the sole method used

the house on thursday rejected a 
constitutional amendment to protect the american flag from 
desecration heeding opponents who said it would risk damage to the 
bill of rights 
the 254177 tally left the amendment which was supported by 
president bush 34 votes short of the twothirds majority required 
to amend the constitution republicans voted 15917 for it 
democrats 16095 against 
the vote followed a sometimes impassioned day of debate 
featuring more than 100 speeches including a rare address by the 
speaker of the house rep thomas s foley dwash 
we should not amend the constitution of the united states to 
reach the sparse and scattered and despicable conduct of a few who 
would dishonor the flag and defile it said foley who also cast 
a rare speakers vote to register his opposition to the amendment 
by tradition the speaker does not normally engage in debate or 
vote 
countered rep henry hyde rill let us take the flag out of 
the gutter where the counterculture has dragged it and is smearing 
it we have 10 amendments that guarantee us all sorts of rights 
how about one amendment that gives us a duty 
foley told reporters that thursdays vote would be the last one 
on the amendment this year in the house but republicans promised 
to keep the issue alive 
i am confident this debate is going to go on for a long 
time rep newt gingrich rga told the chamber asked about 
the bushs efforts on behalf of the amendment gingrich said it 
was very hard for the president in two days to override the 
speaker 
supporters of the amendment backed by veterans groups seeking 
more time to lobby had tried to delay thursdays vote until next 
week but were defeated 231192 
rep rep gv montgomery dmiss the chairman of the house 
veterans committee and the amendments prime democratic sponsor 
said of the proposal i think we owe it to the brave americans 
who have died for this country 
but rep david obey dwis decried the attempt to modify the 
first amendment 
when i look around the politicians today i see more people 
who remind me of daffy duck than thomas jefferson he said 
the strength of the opposition was larger than expected and was 
aided by the unexpected support of some conservatives 
up until 24 hours ago i was a sponsor of this amendment 
said rep tim valentine dnc but over the rhetoric of the past 
few days i finally heard the voice of my own conscience 
the amendment read the congress and the states shall have 
power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the united 
states 
it was first proposed in 1989 after the supreme court ruled that 
flag burning was a form of protected free speech the issue was 
revived last week when the court rejected last years attempt to 
pass an antiflagburning law that the court could accept 
after the vote on the amendment the house also rejected a new 
statute not a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning 
the bill narrowly drawn in hopes of avoiding court rejection 
would impose fines and jail terms for people who burn flags to 
promote violence or who burn flags on federal property or belonging 
to the federal government 
republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after their 
leadership called it a fig leaf to protect democrats who 
opposed the constitutional amendment and it lost 236179 
the senate is expected to vote next week on the amendment which 
would require a twothirds vote in both chambers and approval by 
38 of the 50 states for ratification foley said the house would 
not vote again this year 
regardless of the outcome on capitol hill republicans promise 
to raise the issue in this falls campaign the house majority 
leader rep richard gephardt dmo acknowledged the political 
tightrope members were walking 
several members decorated their speeches with flags and other 
props 
rep gary ackerman trying to highlight the difficulty of 
enforcing legislation to protect the flag held aloft a wide 
variety of household items and gags decorated with the stars and 
stripes 
how about american flag napkins he said holding one 
what if you blow your nose in one have you broken the law 
although ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the 
debate rep james inhofe rokla said he was offended 
most republican speakers supported the amendment the bulk of 
opposition came from democrats 
there also was a noticeable generational tilt in the debate 
house minority leader bob michel rill a decorated world war 
ii veteran cosponsored the amendment and called it a measured 
prudent limited thoughtful approach to the problem 
surely this is something different from the assault on the 
bill of rights some critics say it is he said 
rep james h quillen rtenn another world war ii vet used 
photographs of the famed iwo jima flag raising and of a 
flagburning protest in new yorks central park to dramatize his 
support for the amendment 
but rep david bonior dmich a vietnam veteran who said he 
would never forget the sacrifices that have been made so that our 
flag can fly proudly and freely was a leader of the opposition 
in 200 years of our history these basic freedoms have never 
been amended never and if we start now who knows what freedoms 
will be next where will it end he asked

constitutional amendment against flag burning

the amendment 
a copy of the bill of rights was displayed by rep ben jones 
dga who said he would vote against the flag amendment to protect 
those constitutional freedoms 
rep gary ackerman brought a box of props to illustrate his 
speech on the inherent difficulty of enforcing legislation to 
protect the flag 
he held up one at a time a hat socks pantyhose a paper 
plate and a bathing suit ill spare you the athletic 
supporters all decorated with the stars and stripes 
how about american flag napkins he asked holding one 
what if you blow your nose in one have you broken the law he 
said to the laughter of his colleagues 
ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the debate but 
rep james inhofe rokla said he was offended personally by 
ackermans examples 
as the debate went on inside about 30 demonstrators on the 
capitol lawn protested the amendment an equal number of police 
officers kept watch 
most demonstrators were from a group called the vietnam veterans 
against the warantiimperialist 
the big mouths in there were challenging them to a

panicked monrovians scrambled to get on 
planes and cars leaving the city thursday a day after rebels 
captured a town 15 miles northeast of the capital 
the fall of careysburg gave the rebels control of an entrance to 
the us governments voice of america transmitter for africa the 
transmitter is about 1 mile from the settlement 
no americans were at the huge radio relay station wednesday when 
rebels seeking the ouster of president samuel doe attacked and 
within hours seized the town according to western diplomats and 
careysburg residents who fled to monrovia 
careysburg is a settlement of gracious houses styled after the 
southern us plantation mansions careysburg was built by the 
freed american slaves who founded this west african nation in 1847 
the rebels have been advancing toward the capital since late 
december 
on thursday fist fights almost broke out at the small spriggs 
payne airfield among passengers who elbowed their way aboard two 
chartered planes heading east for abidjan the capital of 
neighboring ivory coast 
the exodus west by road to sierra leone has been slowed by a 
fuel shortage on thursday hundreds of cars were lined up outside 
gas stations in monrovia and people fought to buy fuel which has 
nearly doubled in price 
the rebel advance comes a few days before a second round of 
peace talks between the warring parties is scheduled to begin in 
freetown sierra leone after a first round earlier this month the 
rebels signed an agreement pledging to exercise selfrestraint in 
the use of military force 
church sources said a delegation of christian and moslem leaders 
mediating the talks met thursday with doe at his atlantic oceanside 
mansion in monrovia 
were not optimistic one church leader he said doe dwelled 
on concessions he has made including a promise not to stand for 
reelection at polls scheduled in october 1991 
the liberian leader has refused to concede to a rebel demand 
that he resign saying it would leave a dangerous power vacuum

marion barrys attorney on thursday revealed 
inconsistencies in statements by a key government witness in the 
mayors drug and perjury trial and accused him of lying to save 
himself from a long prison term 
but charles lewis completing his testimony after three days on 
the stand stuck to his story that he and barry smoked crack 
cocaine together in the nations capital and the virgin islands 
you care for yourself lewis said when defense attorney r 
kenneth mundy compared his statements to investigators 
thats exactly it mundy said if you would lie to the 
grand jury in january 1989 to save marion barry a man who is not 
a particular friend you would surely lie in august 1989 to protect 
charles lewis and a lot of other people who are closer to you 
wouldnt you 
no i wouldnt lewis responded 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to three felony counts of 
perjury one misdemeanor count of conspiracy and nine counts of 
cocaine possession 
lewis testified in his three days on the witness stand that he 
shared drugs with the threeterm mayor repeatedly between 1986 and 
1988 a convicted drug dealer lewis is facing sentencing on 
drugrelated charges in his native virgin islands 
mundy attacked lewis credibility saying the witness had 
several times told investigators one thing and jurors in the trial 
another 
the defense attorney read from lewis testimony to a grand jury 
last year that barry visited lewis at a washington hotel one night 
after a monday night football game had ended lewis alleged this 
week that the mayor was there earlier during the game using crack 
cocaine 
if the earlier testimony is true barry wouldnt have been 
there at all on the 19th would he mundy said 
marion barry was there that monday night lewis told mundy 
lewis said another contradiction between his grand jury 
statements and trial testimony on where he and barry allegedly 
discussed drugs at one point resulted from a misunderstanding 
by the court reporter at the grand jury 
mundy also said lewis testimony suggested a third person may 
have been present when he and barry allegedly smoked crack in 
lewiss hotel room on dec 22 1988 
lewis said that implication was a mistake there was no 
security no one else 
lewis also agreed with mundys suggestion that he was not close 
friends with barry but said the two felt comfortable together 
barry felt comfortable with me and i felt comfortable with him 
on those short occasions when they used drugs lewis told said 
mundy 
the federal probe of barry began when city police aborted an 
attempted undercover drug buy from lewis when they discovered barry 
was in lewis washington hotel room in december 1988 
lewis said wednesday that he and barry agreed to get our 
stories straight after the mayors visits to lewis became public 
and that barry asked him to lie to police about their alleged drug 
use 
after lewis testified a bellhop at the washington hotel where 
lewis and barry allegedly used cocaine supported some of lewis 
testimony the bellhop said he saw barry arrive at the hotel on 
three of the four days lewis has said the mayor visited him 
police found traces of cocaine on the desk and nightstand inside 
lewis hotel room on dec 23 1988 according to a document 
introduced into evidence by prosecutors defense attorneys agreed 
to the contents of the record 
lewis is cooperating with the government in its case against 
barry as part of a plea bargain agreement resulting from separate 
drug charges in the nations capital

a house committee on thursday approved a 158 
billion foreign aid bill that begins shifting americas emphasis 
from military to economic help declaring the west has won the 
cold war and we have a right to say so 
but the measure won approval by the appropriations committee 
only after rep david obey chairman of the foreign aid 
subcommittee agreed to restore 144 million to military aid 
accounts as the price of republican support for the package 
other major disputes over us aid to el salvador to cambodian 
rebels and to international population control agencies were 
deferred until the measure goes to the full house expected to be 
next week 
the panel citing diminished eastwest tensions diverted 
roughly 400 million in military aid to refugee aid childrens 
programs and development assistance for countries from eastern 
europe to africa and latin america 
obey dwis called president bushs request for 5 billion in 
military aid an increase of 300 million over the current level 
particularly quaint given the changes in the world the 
committees report claimed victory in the cold war and accused the 
administration of proposing a sleepwalkers budget 
instead the panel approved just over 46 billion in military 
aid to friends and allies around the globe 144 million more than 
obeys subcommittee had voted last week 
to win gop support obey also agreed to provide 50 million for 
the world bank just less than half of what bush had asked obey 
has fought what he sees as the practice of giving money to 
international lenders which ends up going to bail out large 
commercial banks from loans made to third world countries 
and in another concession to the white house the panel agreed 
to raise aid ceilings for three countries which host us military 
bases turkey would get 430 million up 30 million from the 
earlier version of the bill greece would be increased from 280 
million to 301 million and portugal would go from 90 million to 
95 million all remained substantially below currentyear levels 
although republicans agreed to advance the bill to the full 
house the administration still had major problems with some of its 
provisions 
at the top of the list were its restrictions on aid to el 
salvador the bill would withhold half of next years expected 85 
million in military aid the fate of the money would depend on 
progress in peace talks between the government and leftist rebels 
who have waged a 10year civil war 
the assistant secretary of state for the hemisphere bernard 
aronson met late thursday with key lawmakers of both parties to 
begin forging a compromise bipartisan policy toward el salvador 
that could be substituted for that part of the bill 
participants said aronson brought a counterproposal to the 
meeting calling for similar conditions on the us aid money but 
restricting a smaller proportion of it perhaps 25 percent to 30 
percent but democrats were coming under pressure from liberal 
members to hold the line and make no concessions to the 
administration 
another fight loomed over a section barring any aid to the 
noncommunist resistance coalition in cambodia that includes the 
khmer rouge the group believed to have massacred some 1 million 
cambodians when it ruled cambodia in the 1970s 
about 7 million a year in us humanitarian aid now flows to 
the resistance coalition which is fighting the 
vietnameseinstalled government of cambodia the united states 
supports the faction of prince norodom sihanouk and provides aid 
even though some of it finds its way to the khmer rouge the 
militarily strongest part of the coalition 
rep stephen solarz dny planned to fight the provision on 
the floor because he believes it would undermine the resistance in 
united nationssponsored talks aimed at setting up elections

the black widow killer won a temporary 
stay of execution from a federal judge thursday just four hours 
before she was to go to the electric chair for poisoning her 
husband 
us district judge patricia fawsett blocked the scheduled 1201 
pm execution of judi buenoano at florida state prison to hear 
arguments on whether the states electric chair can malfunction and 
cruelly torture a prisoner 
the defense contends it can citing the states botched 
execution may 4 of jesse tafero flames and smoke shot out from 
under taferos hood and witnesses said he seemed to breathe and 
move after two of the three jolts he was given 
buenoanos case went before a federal court for the first time 
after the state supreme court voted 43 wednesday to reject the 
appeal on the grounds that floridas chair is defective 
following her 800 am ruling fawsett spent the day listening 
to arguments then adjourning the hearing until friday ms 
buenoanos death warrant does not expire until monday 
ms buenoano 47 could become the first women executed in 
florida since the states electric chair came into use in 1924 and 
the 23rd person put to death in the state and the 131st 
nationally since the us supreme court lifted its deathpenalty 
ban in 1976 
only one woman has been executed in the united states since the 
high courts ruling north carolina executed velma barfield by 
injection in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend 
prosecutors nicknamed ms buenoano the black widow because of 
her record of trying in most cases successfully to kill the men 
in her life she was condemned for the 1971 fatal poisoning of her 
husband but was also convicted of drowning her paralyzed 
19yearold son and trying to kill a boyfriend with a bomb 
in the hearing thursday an executionequipment expert testified 
that floridas chair is so badly made it can malfunction and 
torture a prisoner at any time 
fred a leuchter jr who designs and manufactures execution 
systems and hardware told fawsett a bad electrode caused the 
sparks smoke and flames around taferos head 
if no modifications or changes are made this could reoccur 
in every execution that comes up or every other one or 
intermittently said leuchter 
but the state argued that the smoke and flame were caused by a 
synthetic sponge attached to the electrode it has been replaced 
and everything is in working order for the next execution the 
department of corrections has said 
assistant attorney general margene roper repeated contentions by 
prison officials that tafero did not suffer and was dead after the 
first of three surges of electricity 
leuchter who was dubbed dr death on a recent television 
show featuring his execution systems called floridas chair a 
makeshift device poorly made and maintained 
he said corrosion or a break in an electrode resulted in a 
nonlethal charge that did not kill tafero until he was jolted 
three times 
defense lawyer jay nickerson pointed to ms buenoano sitting at 
the defense table and asked leuchter can you say that this 
woman when she is strapped into the electric chair will not 
experience cruel and unnecessary punishment 
no i cannot answered leuchter 
the state plans to reschedule the execution as soon as any stay 
expired said jon peck a spokesman for gov bob martinez 
we are fully confident that we know what went wrong in the 
last execution and its been fixed said peck 
ms buenoano was taken from the prison in starke to orlando on 
thursday morning on fawsetts order according to state department 
of corrections spokeswoman paula tully

the christa mcauliffe planetarium was 
dedicated thursday as a memorial to the teacherastronaut killed in 
the challenger disaster and a way to honor her passion for 
motivating children to learn 
this planetarium is more than a memorial to christa mcauliffe 
it is more than a planetarium it is a promise to continue the 
work she believed in and a promise to fulfill her dream said 
nasa administrator richard truly 
about 1500 people including some of mcauliffes former 
students and white house chief of staff john sununu attended the 
opening ceremony 
the 26 million planetarium is new hampshires official 
memorial to the 37yearold concord high school teacher who died 
with six other astronauts when the space shuttle exploded in 
january 1986 
the national aeronautics and space administration had selected 
mcauliffe as its first citizen in space from among 11000 teachers 
who applied for the spot 
christa was selected because she was an extraordinary role 
model as a teacher and an extraordinary role model as a person 
her widower steven said thursday 
he said his wifes goal was to excite and motivate children to 
learn and that she saw her shuttle mission as a way to honorably 
and credibly represent classroom teachers and the debt and respect 
that we owe to them 
mcauliffe and other speakers said the planetarium has 
accomplished those goals 
at a news conference before the dedication truly said hed like 
to see ordinary citizens return to space but made no promises 
because of the backlog of missions caused by the challenger 
disaster 
truly who flew on two shuttle missions said the experience of 
spaceflight is deserving to be shared with people who are not 
just like me 
right now weve got a series of important precious national 
missions to get off and weve got our hands full so im going to 
put that decision off a little bit he said he has made 
similar statements before 
the planetarium resulted from the fierce pride and love of 
people who cared about someone and who cared about what christa 
cared about said sununu who was new hampshires governor when 
the challenger exploded 
most of the funding for the planetarium came from the state but 
there were private donations as well including money raised by 
schoolchildren across new hampshire 
the planetarium which took 18 months to build features an 
interactive system that allows the audience to select by an 
electronic majority vote where they want to travel in the universe 
it also will allow journeys into mathematics geology meteorology 
art the history of music or the demise of the dinosaurs 
a special commission chose the planetarium from scores of 
suggestions for memorials to mcauliffe including a portrait a 
state holiday or a brightly lit statue atop mount washington new 
englands highest peak 
louise wiley of pittsfield suggested the planetarium 
she said thursday she had envisioned a smaller planetarium in a 
high school that students would run never in a million years did 
i think it would end up like this she said 
it is a dream we had tears in our eyes watching it 
mcauliffes mother grace corrigan looked on with pride 
im very happy and very proud to think that something so 
disastrous is culminating in something so wonderful she said

mexicans who repeatedly cross the us border 
illegally will be prosecuted instead of being shipped home the top 
federal immigration official said thursday 
immigration and naturalization service commissioner gene mcnary 
also vowed to seek prosecution and imprisonment for people who 
smuggle aliens 
mcnary said he favors creating a lottery to allow some 
foreigners to enter the united states even if they dont meet 
existing requirements that they have relatives or jobs waiting for 
them in this country 
but mcnary said his superiors in the bush administration might 
reject his lottery proposal 
the commissioner who took over the federal agency last october 
spoke during a thursday news conference and at a luncheon meeting 
of town hall of california a civic group 
the number of border patrol agents in the san diego area will 
increase from the current 750 to about 1000 within a year mcnary 
said more detention facilities and improved border lighting and 
detection devices will be added he said 
about 40 percent to 45 percent of all illegal aliens entering 
the united states cross a 12 to 14mile stretch of the border near 
san diego mcnary said the ins now lets most illegal aliens return 
to mexico voluntarily without formal deportation proceedings a 
process mcnary called a revolving door 
the policy will continue for many illegal immigrants but people 
who smuggle aliens and those aliens who cross the border repeatedly 
will be fingerprinted detained and deported he said 
those who violate deportation orders by reentering the united 
states can be charged with a misdemeanor the first time and a 
felony the second time he added 
were talking about the serious offenders he said the ins 
estimates there are about 1000 smugglers who live off and prey 
on innocent victims he said 
mcnary acknowledged the gettough approach might create a big 
backlog of court cases but said it should have a deterrent effect 
a lot of people would like to have a big wall or ditch or 
something mcnary said adding he simply wants to try to 
enforce the existing laws 
mcnary discouraged american motorists who on recent nights have 
lined up on the us side of the border to shine their headlights 
toward mexico to dissuade illegal immigration 
as for any americans who might take stronger measures to 
discourage illegal immigration mcnary declared i have 
absolutely no tolerance for vigilantes absolutely none

a constitutional agreement aimed at keeping 
frenchspeaking quebec in the canadian federation was on the brink 
of death thursday blocked in two provinces as the deadline for 
passage approached 
prime minister brian mulroney flew to st johns newfoundland 
one of the holdouts in an effort to save the agreement which must 
be ratified by all 10 provinces by midnight saturday or expire he 
warned that sinking the accord could prompt another referendum in 
quebec this time by the separatists 
troubles loomed too in winnipeg manitoba where a legislator 
has managed to block debate for a week on the agreement 
eight of the provinces favor the meech lake accord as it is 
called and mulroney is one of the most ardent supporters of the 
agreement 
in a restrained but tough address mulroney confronted 
newfoundlands 52seat legislature with the possibility of 
constitutional paralysis economic problems and increased support 
for the separatist cause 
on that night when youre sitting there with your family and 
your children one thought is going to go through your mind do you 
mean to tell me that we could have avoided all of this for meech 
lake mulroney said 
if that night were ever to come the terms of meech lake are 
going to look very very reasonable indeed to every member of this 
house of assembly and every house of assembly across canada 
one hour after mulroney concluded his address a bomb threat 
forced a 45minute evacuation of the legislature 
the fivepoint agreement would designate quebec a distinct 
society something the supreme court would be obliged to consider 
when looking at specific laws challenged under the constitution 
the meech lake agreement first approved by the prime minister 
and the premiers of the provinces in 1987 is aimed at winning 
quebecs signature on canadas 1982 constitution at that time the 
ministers set a threeyear deadline for approval by the parliament 
and legislatures 
in the interim governments changed in three of the provinces 
manitoba newfoundland and new brunswick and the premiers 
reneged on the signatures of their predecessors 
in early june mulroney called the premiers to ottawa where they 
spent a week in intense private meetings they agreed to pass the 
original accord as it is new brunswick passed it last week 
newfoundland premier clyde wells put the agreement up for a vote 
in his legislature where it is still being debated 
the biggest challenge has come from manitoba legislator elijah 
harper who as a cree is the only indian in the provincial 
legislature has said he will kill meech lake because it does not 
take native rights into consideration 
many of the indians and inuit leaders of canada believe their 
societies are as distinct as quebecs and they also want to be 
recognized in the constitution 
manitoba law requires public hearings before a vote on 
constitutional amendments and procedural delays introduced by 
harper have pushed debate back so far that it may be impossible to 
pass the measure before the deadline 
for many quebecois in montreal canadas secondlargest city 
the arguments have worn thin and the endless debate over a document 
thought signed and sealed in 1987 has led to widespread cynicism 
and a rise in nationalist feelings 
a poll published thursday in the frenchlanguage newspaper la 
presse indicated that 57 percent of quebecois favor sovereignty up 
slightly from 56 percent in march 
but unlike a decade ago when a referendum was held by the 
separatist parti quebecois to determine the future of the province 
passion is missing 
i think people have accepted that it meech lake wont pass 
with a shrug said robert gagnon a computer systems specialist 
for a montreal insurance company 
an exception to that feeling came from cabbie roger solari 
asked about independence for quebec he responded with a vigorous 
ah oui slapping the steering wheel for emphasis they dont 
want us were better off independent 
premier robert bourassa has categorically rejected suggestions 
for extending the saturday deadline there will be a profound 
disappointment sadness and much disillusionment in quebec he 
said 
jean chretien leading candidate for the leadership of the 
opposition liberal party told the partys congress in calgary that 
failure of meech lake would not necessarily mean a breakup of 
canada 
but premier frank mckenna of new brunswick once a strong 
opponent of meech lake predicted a wave of intolerance across 
canada if the deal fails 
we will see waves of hatred taking place across our beloved 
land mckenna said there will be alienation and lots of it 
enough to go around for everyone

a conservative lawmaker thursday blamed the 
government for death threats made against a prominent critic and 
warned there could be a violent reaction if human rights abuses 
by police are not curbed 
the death threats directed against jorge castaneda a prominent 
journalist and intellectual have provoked an uproar castaneda has 
been an outspoken critic of the economic and political policies of 
president carlos salinas de gortari and the ruling institutional 
revolutionary party 
the city council of mexico city has demanded an investigation of 
the threats the usbased committee for the protection of 
journalists wrote a letter to salinas that said it is profoundly 
worried about the threats 
cesar coll a federal lawmaker from the rightofcenter 
opposition national action party said the government was trying to 
intimidate castaneda because he is one of its most prominent 
critics 
the government is to blame for these threats coll told a 
news conference if it doesnt gain control over the police 
there could be a violent reaction 
on wednesday the executive committee of the institutional 
revolutionary party condemned the threats against castaneda it 
issued a statement calling them repugnant and adding that the 
case would be a good test for the governments new human rights 
commission 
earlier this week salinas called castaneda from tokyo where 
the president was making a state visit to express his solidarity 
in the face of this unacceptable incident 
salinas also made public a letter he wrote to castaneda saying 
the threats go precisely against what i have maintained as an 
invariable norm of conduct for my administration 
last friday castanedas secretary said she was stopped by four 
armed men interrogated at gunpoint and warned that her employer 
would be killed if he continued his activities 
on monday she identified one of the men who threatened her as a 
member of the mexico city judicial police on her way home from the 
prosecutors office she said she was again threatened by an armed 
man 
castaneda said he holds the government responsible for his 
safety and that of his family 
the incidents follow the release earlier this month of a report 
by a human rights monitoring group that sharply criticizes abuses 
by the police and security forces in mexico 
the report by the new yorkbased americas watch human rights 
in mexico a policy of impunity said violent human rights 
abuses have become institutionalized 
this pattern of excessive violence and abuse can only mean 
that either the mexican government has adopted a policy of 
tolerating such behavior or it has lost control over its police 
security and prosecuting agencies the report said 
torture and extrajudicial killings by federal and state 
police and the countrys security forces are disturbingly frequent 
in mexico it said 
americas watch cited several cases in which journalists had been 
intimidated kidnapped or murdered the most notorious is the 1984 
assassination of the outspoken columnist manuel buendia the 
salinas administration has indicted the former head of the mexican 
equivalent of the fbi in the slaying 
castaneda has written for newsweek the los angeles times and 
the mexican magazine proceso he also coauthored the recent book on 
usmexico relations limits to friendship with robert pastor 
of emory university in atlanta 
castaneda the son of a former mexican foreign minister is a 
supporter of leftist opposition leader cuauhtemoc cardenas leader 
of the democratic revolutionary party cardenas ran a strong second 
to salinas in the 1988 presidential election 
mexicos government and ruling party have long been accused 
inside mexico of using threats and violence to intimidate opponents 
and election fraud to maintain the institutional revolutionary 
partys 61yearold grip on power 
the castaneda incident coming on the heels of the americas watch 
report has focused international attention on allegations of human 
rights abuses 
in the past americas watch said such allegations had been 
overlooked saying this was more a testament to the mexican 
governments careful cultivation of its prohuman rights image than 
its care to ensure that individual human rights are respected 
other government critics have reported receiving death threats 
norma corona sapien the head of a state human rights commission in 
the west coast state of sinaloa received similar threats before 
she was gunned down on a street in the capital of culiacan may 21 
salinas who has pledged to end corruption and strongarm 
tactics by the ruling party created the national human rights 
commission after the corona slaying

peace talks between the salvadoran 
government and leftist rebels were suspended twice thursday over 
the thorny issue of impunity for the armed forces in human rights 
cases 
the talks mediated by a un envoy entered their third day 
negotiators want an accord to end el salvadors 10yearold civil 
war which has claimed an estimated 73000 lives several previous 
rounds ended without resolution 
col humberto vargas a member of the government negotiating 
team said he expected partial accords not spectacular 
results would come out of the latest negotiations 
the government has said progress depends on reaching an 
agreement on a ceasefire but the rebel farabundo marti national 
liberation front has insisted the issue of the armed forces be 
resolved first 
the rebels want the armed forces sharply reduced members of the 
right wing death squads purged and punishment for those who 
participated in political slayings the squads are believed 
responsible for thousands of civilian deaths the talks were 
suspended two times and were about to break off because of the 
heated arguments we had over the issue of the armed forces but the 
un representative brought us back to the negotiating table a 
rebel negotiator said on condition of anonymity 
un mediator alvaro de soto met separately with the rebel and 
government delegations thursday 
we are working on political accords that are necessary to 
arrive at negotiation of a ceasefire and we have taken up the 
issue of impunity proposed at the negotiating table soto said 
its logical for the situation to be difficult after 10 years of 
war there is progress but its minimal 
vargas said thursday that both sides were working to reach a 
point of equilibrium on the issue of the armed forces so we can 
move on to other issues 
shafik handal a member of the rebel high command said that if 
the question of the armed forces is not resolved it will be 
difficult to move on 
the talks being held in the mountain resort of oaxtepec 40 
miles from mexico city are the first since 1987 for the rebels and 
rightist government led by alfredo cristiani 
no salvadoran officer has been convicted of a crime involving 
politically motivated human rights abuse the rebels want that 
changed 
they particularly want the government to bring to justice the 
killers of archbishop oscar romero slain while saying mass in 
1980 and of six jesuit priests shot to death in november 
the decadeold civil war has turned el salvador into the largest 
recipient of us aid in the western hemisphere

the united states faces a painful decision 
between easing its opposition to forced repatriation of vietnamese 
boat people or seeing them pushed back out to sea perhaps to 
die because southeast asian countries are threatening to end 
temporary asylum congress was told thursday 
countries providing temporary first asylum refuge under a 
yearold geneva agreement have given the united states until july 1 
to arrange new options for people screened out as ineligible for 
resettlement usually because they are fleeing poverty rather than 
political persecution said the state departments refugee chief 
without waiting for the deadline malaysia has forced an 
estimated 7700 boat people back to sea causing five reported 
deaths said princeton n lyman refugee programs director in 
testimony before the asiapacific subcommittee of the house foreign 
affairs committee 
we have joined others in calling upon the malaysian government 
to cease such pushoffs immediately and to resume granting asylum 
to all who seek it lyman added 
the ultimatum from a manila meeting of participating countries 
last month threatens the worst crisis in a decade of indochina 
refugee relief humanitarian organizations testified 
we may be faced with choosing the lesser of two evils said 
subcommittee chairman stephen solarz dny the countries of 
first asylum called upon the united states either to agree to 
the mandatory return of nonrefugees or provide another 
alternative such as a holding center for nonrefugees 
it is now the 11th hour for the vietnamese boat people said 
rep hamilton fish rny 
fish and rep chester atkins dmass announced they are 
reluctantly introducing a resolution that would support mandatory 
repatriation of nonpolitical refugees as a last resort with 
adequate screening and safeguards by the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees 
a holding center for such refugees would become a magnet for 
greater flows of boat people refugees and quickly fill to capacity 
atkins said especially if located on any us territory 
lyman said the us administration continues to oppose 
involuntary return to vietnam under present conditions in that 
country answering questions he said the july 1 deadline doesnt 
necessarily mean first asylum for vietnamese will be ended by all 
countries and he hopes they will hesitate and avoid a lot of 
negative consequences 
noting that the united states acquiesces to involuntary 
repatriation to such countries as china haiti el salvador and 
guatemala but not vietnam solarz called the policy 
intellectually incoherent

in the age of aids the chicken ranch 
brothel is an island of safe sex in a sea of disease 
researchers spent most of the last year examining the results of 
4858 gonorrhea cultures 1333 blood tests for syphilis and 849 
hiv antibody tests 
the preliminary results scheduled to be presented at the sixth 
international conference on aids on saturday 20 positive gonorrhea 
tests all but one before 1985 no positive syphilis tests since 
1983 and no positive hiv tests since aids antibody screening began 
in 1986 
that was the same year condom use became the law at all 35 legal 
brothels in the state of nevada 
the study was conducted by researchers from the school of public 
health at the university of california los angeles 
i think this represents a successful marriage wrong term a 
successful collaboration between private industry and state 
regulators in the state of nevada said dr gary richwald 
assistant professor in uclas department of community health 
services who led the 21000 study funded by the nevada brothel 
association 
the wrong results could have meant disaster for the ranch but 
it was a risk coowner russell reade was willing to take 
along about 1985 when the aids epidemic really hit and was 
really a news item i really seriously thought that perhaps the 
party was over said the former high school biology teacher who 
has coowned the ranch since 1982 but with the protections we 
offer with the mandatory testing and the mandatory condoms i was 
pleasantly surprised that business increased and weve actually 
had an increase every year 
every week the 21 ladies of the chicken ranch are screened for 
gonorrhea hiv and syphilis tests are done monthly all tests are 
state law there have been no positive hiv results in any of 
nevadas 300400 licensed prostitutes 
i require that the working ladies of the chicken ranch go 
directly from the lab where the test is administered to the chicken 
ranch and wait for the test results after returning from any time 
off whatsoever reade said we agree that a lady is in complete 
control in the brothel to mandate the condom she may not be able 
to exercise such complete control in her personal life and there 
is where she is probably at greater risk 
from 1982 to 1989 about 87000 men visited the chicken ranch 
in pahrump nev about an hour outside of las vegas only 31 of 
the 7000 men who came to the brothel in the first half of this 
year refused to use condoms 
theyre gentlemen about it they just happen to have very 
strong feelings about it reade said they are graciously 
refused service 
for many of the men coming to the chicken ranch brothel 
theyre using condoms for the first time richwald said i 
think this demonstrates condom use is possible successful can be 
intimate and is a behavior they might consider at home as well 
the ranchs employees tend to be white and in their 20s all 
fees are negotiated and most women see about 15 clients a week for 
a gross weekly income of about 3000 half of that goes to the 
brothel 
the owners make sure their employees know the latest techniques 
to make safe sex erotic

the army said it has thrown out all 
records of its investigation into the world war ii theft of german 
medieval artworks that wound up in a small town in texas 
as a result the army may never know whether a former soldier 
from texas who died in 1980 was a suspect in the theft an army 
spokeswoman told the denison herald in an interview published 
thursday 
the artifacts some of them stored in the vault of the first 
national bank in whitewright have been valued in the millions of 
dollars by german art experts 
a lutheran church in quedlinburg east germany is suing to 
recover the artwork from the bank and the late joe t meadors 
family 
meador is believed to have stolen the objects while an army 
lieutenant and stashed them in his hometown about 60 miles north 
of dallas he left the artifacts to a brother and sister 
army military police investigated the theft but the file was 
apparently destroyed in 1964 when records of all cases older than 
15 years were purged barbara parker a spokeswoman at the us 
army crime records center in fort holabird md told the herald 
only records of historical interest survived the housecleaning 
parker said 
the army abandoned the case in 1949 when quedlinburg became part 
of east germany army spokesmen have said it is unclear whether the 
military will reopen the case 
the articles allegedly taken by meador include a silver ivory 
and gold reliquary from the 9th or 10th century a 10th century 
byzantine rockcrystal flask with sides formed like birds and an 
ivory comb inlaid with precious stones 
meadors heirs jack meador 70 and jane cook 58 said earlier 
this week that their unoccupied farmhouse was ransacked monday 
night by burglars who mistakenly believed the treasure was there 
the burglary was described in a motion filed by meador and ms 
cook seeking a protective order to keep all parties in the lawsuit 
from discussing the case in public us district judge sidney a 
fitzwater denied the motion tuesday 
the bank had acknowledged the artifacts are in the vault 
fitzwater has ordered the bank to allow representatives of the 
church to inventory and photograph the artifacts 
denison is 70 miles north of dallas

the devastation wrought by an earthquake that killed at least 
25000 people 
tens of thousands also were injured in the early morning temblor 
that rocked northern iran 
at the united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
expressed condolences to the iranian government and the families of 
the victims 
perez de cuellar in a message to iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani said the un system was ready to provide all possible 
assistance 
its disaster relief coordinator dispatched an emergency team 
and an airlift of emergency supplies from un warehouses was 
undertaken in coordination with iranian authorities officials said 
a statement from the un disaster relief organization in geneva 
said the most immediate needs were for medicine medical supplies 
and tents other needs include canned food blankets clothing 
vehicles and heavyduty equipment 
the organization was sending a senior officer and relief 
coordination officer to the stricken areas and a special task 
force was established at the iranian presidents office to 
coordinate relief the un said 
the iranian government already has allocated 14 million for 
relief 
in brussels the european community agreed to donate 12 
million to help send emergency relief equipment to the area it was 
announced 
a spokesman for the league of red cross in geneva said the 
organization would have no comment on relief efforts until friday 
morning 
but an american red cross official in washington said were 
attempting to raise money to send to the red crescent society to 
help buy tents blankets food medical supplies and emergency 
lighting red crescent is the islamic equivalent of the red cross

rather than shipping the supplies and had established a tollfree 
nationwide telephone number for people wanting to make 
contributions

supplies to iran via hartford conn as soon as clearance has

we are saddened by the damage and the loss of life 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said we are also expressing our 
willingness to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance should 
it be requested

the senate on thursday rejected a move that 
democrats said would gut a proposed 2 billion program to encourage 
construction of new and renovated housing for lowincome people 
the amendment was defeated on a 5245 vote largely along party 
lines as the senate spent a fourth day debating a bill that would 
overhaul federal housing policy 
the housing bill faced a long list of other amendments the 
senate concluded for the evening after majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine said progress had stalled and that debate would 
resume friday 
negotiations between democratic sponsors and the bush 
administration which has opposed major portions of the bill 
appeared to have broken down mitchell said he expected them to 
resume friday 
sen alan cranston dcalif who a day earlier said he was 
optimistic about reaching agreement with the administration on the 
bill said he was never able to talk with housing and urban 
development secretary jack kemp as he had expected 
its difficult to find out what an administration is really 
thinking if theyre unwilling to talk to you cranston said 
sen alfonse damato rny pleaded with the senate to accept 
the amendment that would allow states and cities to use the 2 
billion provided through the new housing opportunity partnerships 
program to help the poor with rental assistance as well as to build 
or rehabilitate housing 
if this amendment fails were not going to have a housing 
bill damato said i dont know how we can come to an 
agreement 
damato and republican supporters said it would give local 
governments more flexibility 
but democratic opponents led by cranston said the move was an 
attack on the program to provide money for construction he said 
other provisions of the bill have money to provide the poor with 
vouchers and other methods of rental assistance 
the hop program was carefully designed to expand the supply of 
affordable housing through rehabilitation new construction and 
acquisition cranston said the requirements of tenant rental 
assistance and the requirements of investment funds to provide more 
housing are very different and the two activities need to be kept 
separate 
the bill would provide a total of 176 billion for all housing 
assistance some 4 billion more than president bushs budget asked 
for 
among the stumbling blocks was disagreement over kemps proposal 
to increase downpayment requirements for home purchasers who 
obtain federal housing administration loan guarantees and make 
other changes aimed at shoring up the financially endangered fha 
program 
also in dispute was kemps home ownership opportunity for people 
everywhere or hope program which would provide money to 
encourage lowincome tenants of public housing to purchase their 
homes democrats included it in the bill but with less money than 
the administration wanted

secretary of state james a baker iii and the 
german foreign ministers began talks thursday on the international 
aspects of german unification 45 years after the allies divided 
the nation 
baker arrived in east berlin on thursday for separate talks with 
markus meckel the east german foreign minister and west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher at issue was a declaration 
that would restore germanys control of berlin and set forth the 
united nations borders 
the four victorious world war ii allies the united states the 
soviet union britain and france would sign the document along 
with east and west germany 
the toughest issues however would be set aside these us 
officials said include the size of the german army and whether the 
united country could be a member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
such issues concern the soviet union which wants to keep 
germany out of nato but a senior us official said moscows 
kitchen sink approach to the final settlement was not 
acceptable to the western allies 
still meckel proposed that the 16 nato and 7 warsaw pact 
members issue a declaration saying they do not regard each other 
as enemies and they wouldnt use any force against each other 
meckel told reporters after he met with baker that the 
declaration would assure moscow that nato was not a hostile 
alliance against the soviet union and assure the east europeans 
as well 
we havent talked about the details meckel said 
the idea initially was broached by the soviets at the washington 
superpower summit in early june baker then took it up with the 
nato foreign ministers in turnberry scotland two weeks ago 
asked about the proposal baker did not reply directly 
he said he had talked to meckel about several subjects some 
perhaps have promise some do not he said 
meanwhile west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
said after meeting with baker that the idea would be discussed 
further 
the soviets are about to lose east germany their most powerful 
ally which will merge its economy with west germanys on july 2 
full incorporation is expected to follow perhaps before the end of 
the year 
the soviets are trying to slow the merger while seeking 
assurances against a renewal of german militarism at least 20 
million soviets died before germanys defeat in world war ii 
the discussions about a german settlement will continue friday 
the occasion is another in a series of socalled 
twoplusfour meetings of the four world war ii allies and the 
two germanys 
us officials said they did not expect the declaration to be 
completed at the oneday session another round is planned for july 
17 in paris 
the four allies have shared control of berlin since the end of 
world war ii the final settlement would return control of the city 
to the germans who are expected to make it their capital 
on the borders question meanwhile baker is pushing for a 
provision establishing that the country would include the territory 
of east and west germany plus berlin and no more polands 
concern that germany might try to recover land now part of poland 
is to be taken up at the paris meeting

france will give more aid to african 
governments that move toward democracy president francois 
mitterrand said thursday at the close of a francoafrican summit 
mitterrand also excluded an immediate lifting of sanctions 
imposed by france on south africa saying the threshold in the 
disappearance of apartheid had not been reached 
french aid to african countries will continue as always the 
french president said 
but it is obvious that this aid will be cooler toward those 
acting in an authoritarian manner and more enthusiastic toward 
those who take with courage this step toward democratization 
mitterrand said 
the french president was flanked at the 16th annual summit by 
moroccos king hassan ii and president omar bongo of gabon of the 
36 nations present 22 were represented by heads of state 
several nations such as gabon have recently moved toward 
political plurality following a wave of protests similar to that 
which swept eastern europe but oneparty states still predominate 
in africa 
during the threeday summit france announced it would halve 
interest rates on loans to gabon ivory coast congo and cameroon 
countries ranked as having intermediate incomes he also announced 
plans to increase aid to less developed countries 
the french president said african nations were cruelly 
installed in this infernal cycle of debtunderdevelopment 
he said he would urge other nations to aid africa at next weeks 
european community summit in dublin and next months summit of the 
seven top western industrialized countries in houston texas 
senegalese president abdou diouf said in a radio interview 
thursday that african governments moving toward genuine democracy 
should receive bonus payments on top of continued foreign aid 
i think each state must go toward multiparty politics diouf 
said if they dont do it now on their own initiative they will 
be obliged to do it tomorrow in less favorable conditions under 
pressure 
many of africas frenchspeaking countries in recent months have 
experienced antigovernment protests and demands for multiparty 
elections 
the threeday summit was held at la baule a resort on the 
brittany coast

if 29 senators have their way goldcolored 
11sided dollar coins commemorating christopher columbus will soon 
be jingling in americans pockets 
however the bush administration and the congressional general 
accounting office say the coins will simply occupy space in 
government vaults unless congress simultaneously moves to end the 
availability of dollar bills 
the government could save an average of 381 million a year by 
minting dollar coins l nye stevens of the gao told the senate 
banking committee on wednesday 
but he warned we think these savings are unlikely to occur 
unless congress and the administration jointly resolve not only to 
eliminate the dollar note but also stand up to a negative public

move over rover this is cat city 
theyre everywhere pyramids have cats apartment stairwells 
have them and offices and hospital examination rooms cats prowl 
hotel lobbies and restaurants theaters have cats and bazaars have 
cats 
even an airplane had one it made frontpage headlines cat 
forces plane back to cairo 
the story tried to explain how a cat found its way into the 
cockpit of an air sinai flight headed for sharm elsheik on the red 
sea 
once airborne the cat made a great fuss about risking one of 
its nine lives in such a manner its howls caused pandemonium 
among the 31 passengers the article said forcing the pilot to 
turn back 
such cat stories abound in egypt where felines have a storied 
history cats were worshiped even before there were pharaohs and 
remained sacred long after the pharaohs were gone 
the singing cats of elgomhouriya a theater where operas are 
performed are famous throughout the city 
hassan kamy egypts leading tenor has been upstaged several 
times 
it was the last act of la boheme he said in an interview 
i was holding the dying mimi in my arms the orchestra was 
silenced for the finale a cat walked onto stage 
at first the audience simply giggled quietly but the cat 
took a long time getting across the stage and i kept holding the 
dying mimi finally the audience was in hysterics 
then there is kamys tale of two cats another opera and a lamp 
the lamp was a stage prop he said all was fine until two 
cats decided to walk onstage and go to sleep at the base 
it was act three a love duet you could feel the emotion in 
the air the audience getting hotter but so were the cats 
they chose this moment to begin a romantic interlude under the 
lamp the higher the diva sang the higher they sang the next 
day newspapers asked which had the greater range the soprano or 
the the cats 
cats made another artistic headline last year by disrupting an 
italian groups performance at an experimental theater festival 
the avantgarde play was set on a beach and the actors insisted 
the stage be covered with sand a foot deep 
midway through the performance cats wandered onto the stage and 
began doing what cats often do in sand the actors were horrified 
the audience howled 
what can you do kamy said nobody will touch a cat even 
now in the villages people are scared of them afraid to harm 
them or anger them cats are sacred in egypt 
in ancient times a favorite goddess was the cat bastet sleek 
and sensual 
shorthaired longlegged house cats domesticated from wilder 
strains are depicted in tomb paintings enjoying lifes better 
things they were much loved in life much mourned at death 
about 2000 years ago worshipers buried mummified cats near 
bastets sacred temples 
cat mummies embalmed and wrapped in intricate bandages were 
dedicated by the thousands archaeologists uncovered 300000 in one 
temple 
even cat fetuses were mummified sometimes and occasionally 
buried with a tiny mouse or ball of yarn 
mummified or live ancient cats never lost their special status 
an official record tells of a roman soldier in alexandria who 
accidentally killed a cat a mob killed the soldier 
owning an egyptian cat was such a mark of prestige that 
phoenician and greek traders and christian monks did big business 
exporting them to the far east and around the mediterranean area 
especially to italy 
trade ended when a place had enough cats to start its own 
colony thus did rome not cairo gain fame as the worlds cat 
capital 
islamic invasions in the seventh century and afterward disrupted 
many aspects of life in egypt but moslems viewed the whiskered 
pets as good omens that protected home and family 
the prophet mohammed is said to have been fond of cats one 
story says he awoke from a nap and wanted to get out of bed but 
found a cat asleep on his robe rather than wake the cat he cut 
the robe 
in the middle ages while their cousins were being killed in 
europe as agents of black magic egyptian cats were pampered as 
usual 
in the 13th century islamic rulers of cairo established a 
special garden for stray cats where attendants served them food 
with pomp each afternoon 
the tradition of feeding strays remained strong in the 19th 
century english travelers wrote home that special servants were 
assigned each afternoon to feed street cats which were 
wellmannered despite questionable pedigrees 
cairos cats still are fed well even poor peasants share their 
bread with stray cats beckoning them with the pet name mishmish 
arabic for apricot the most common color of egyptian cats

michael feinstein the young pianistsinger is 
best known as a leading interpreter of the music of george and ira 
gershwin but hed like to interview elvis costello rocker by 
trade 
that may sound like a clash of cultures but it aint 
necessarily so says susan lester tv producer by trade 
michael is going to be a correspondent on some pieces she 
says and id like to put him together with the kind of artist 
you wouldnt normally see him with 
lesters show is the arts amp entertainment revue a weekly 
onehour cable series that quietly opened for business last spring 
its a show of arts and letters in a time of bottom lines and 
ciphers 
shown twice friday nights on the arts amp entertainment network 
and repeated again saturday evenings and sunday mornings revue 
is close in spirit to omnibus the acclaimed cultural series 
that appeared on all three networks in the 1950s and 60s 
by sheer coincidence lester also was senior producer of the 
last network incarnation of omnibus a 1988 special she did for 
abc news where she worked 10 years before moving to cable in 
january 
the major difference in revue hosted by eric burns is that 
it tries to be timely a cultural newsmagazine 
each program is a showcase for art music films television 
theater dance pop culture and literature says lester brought 
over from abc by former abc vice president av westin executive 
producer of revue 
but current cultural news also is a key element says lester 
who doesnt finish each show until two days before it airs were 
not trying to be news up to the second she says but we 
wouldnt want to be a whole week behind 
as an example she says one show did what amounts to a primer 
on the flap touched off by the robert mapplethorpe homoerotic photo 
exhibits when that controversy was making headlines 
this summer the larger topic of art and obscenity in modern 
times will get the onceover she says 
revue which costs less than 150000 a show has an initial 
26week order the arts amp entertainment network which serves 44 
million homes started airing the show may 4 
the debut episode spotlighted broadway producer harold prince 
who has a record 16 tony awards reporting on his efforts to keep 
musical theater alive the neville brothers showed off the new 
orleans jazz festival in the next show 
in another edition sid caesar and imogene coca reminisced about 
your show of shows there also was a report on an unusual kind 
of rock video with closedcaptioning for the hearingimpaired 
other segments have included veteran dancer edward villella 
conducting a tour of his alma mater the school of american ballet 
a story on a pbs special saluting the music of the late sesame 
street composer joe raposo and a piece on a new homevideo 
offering whos afraid of opera designed for kids and hosted 
by joan sutherland 
tonights show has feinstein singing four littleknown gershwin 
songs including a beautiful ballad will you remember me 
that he says originally was written as an uptempo song 
it was cut from a gershwin musical lady be good and has 
gone unheard until now says feinstein who for six years worked as 
an archivist for the late ira gershwin the lyricwriting half of 
the gershwin brothers 
feinstein who appeared on lesters omnibus special in 1988 
is far removed from the world of rock 
his is the world of the fine old standards and lush 
orchestrations that were revived in woody allens manhattan and 
again in when harry met sally 
but he doesnt think it odd that as a guest correspondent he 
might eventually interview elvis costello whom he met this year 
for starters one costello album features a cover of my funny 
valentine 
he was telling me about how he was influenced by peggy lee and 
frank sinatra records and by the lyrics of ira gershwin 
feinstein says a lot of rock artists are inspired by the old 
guard i hear that intermittently 
producer lester doesnt find it odd either to have the sort of 
show in which say monet and madonna or dick tracy and el 
doctorow can peacefully coexist 
its all part of lifes rich cultural parade she says and 
none of it is mutually exclusive i dont think people divide 
them up that way

every day convoys of bulletproof cars 
roll into east lebanons bekaa valley home ground of shiite moslem 
extremists with syrian security men on guard against kidnappers 
the passengers are europeans based in damascus they are going 
shopping 
some of the diplomats un officials businessmen and oil 
workers have spent thousands of dollars at a time in the ghazali 
supermarket for luxury foods and other items virtually unobtainable 
in economically troubled syria 
off the highway 20 miles northeast of chtaura is baalbek an 
ancient roman city that has become a stronghold of the proiranian 
shiite fundamentalists of hezbollah the party of god 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for shiite 
extremists who hold most of the 16 westerners missing in lebanon 
some of the hostages have been reported held in the bekaa at 
various times 
the supermarket run by five lebaneseamerican brothers is 
amply stocked with good meat smoked salmon shrimp french wines 
and fruit not to mention salt toilet paper computers and washing 
machines 
they have everything you cant get in syria a canadian 
diplomat said 
most of the shoppers feel the dozen or so syrian army 
checkpoints along the highway the main route between beirut and 
damascus are enough protection from kidnappers during the onehour 
drive over the mountains 
as long as you stick to the main highway theres no 
problem said frans ptuyt a dutch diplomat 
another western diplomat who asked that his name be withheld 
said chtauras as far as were allowed to go in lebanon 
plainclothes syrian security men are posted inside the store to 
make sure no one parks a car bomb outside or tries to to grab one 
of the visitors a syrian checkpoint is just 100 yeards away 
the area around heres as safe as damascus said hasan 
ghazali one of the owners 
shoppers in the convoys are from canada austria scandinavia 
eastern europe japan china yemen saudi arabia libya arab 
nations iran and the families of highranking syrians 
american british australia and french diplomats are banned by 
their governments from crossing into lebanon because scores of 
foreigners have been kidnapped since 1984 
the ghazalis made a videotape of shelves crammed with goods from 
all over the world hasan said so the diplomats can do their 
shopping at home they send their syrian or lebanese staffers 
to get what they want 
he said the us embassy sent syrian personnel with long 
shopping lists for parties it gave for former president jimmy 
carter when he visited damascus this year 
hasan and his brothers who lived in the united states for 20 
years before opening the store in 1980 greet customers at the door 
with coffee or tea 
their domain is a gastronomes paradise exotic sauces from 
china lime pickle from pakistan poppadums from india coconut 
milk from thailand flatbread from norway and caviar from the 
soviet union 
in the freezers are shrimp from oman and kuwait salmon from 
norway senagalese squid and fish from argentina 
there are french champagne russian vodka puerto rican rum 
mexican tequila the brothers even sell american root beer 
outofseason fruits are flown in regularly including 
watermelons from sudan mangoes from india and africa south 
american papayas and grapes dates from tunisia 
american british french and german newspapers and magazines 
are stacked at the news stand 
everything comes through illegal lebanese ports run by moslem 
militias 
nadim ghazali said an ambassador bought 3000 worth of cognac 
and wine not long ago and another spent 1200 for cheese wine and 
fruit

john cronin uses the same tools against 
polluters that his medieval forebears used against poachers 
vigilance and cunning 
but the hudsons modernday riverkeeper also wields two more 
weapons outrage and lawsuits 
the hudson he says is supposed to be ours and im not 
going to be a chump for ge exxon or the city of new york who 
think they can take it away from me my children or any kid on the 
street who wants to go to the river with a fishing pole 
so in 1983 when cronin discovered that exxons tankers were 
emptying their ballasts off dutchess and ulster counties and then 
refilling them with fresh water to sell in waterpoor aruba he 
took the giant oil company to court exxon forked over a 
halfmillion dollars in settlement 
so has he taken on new york city in a slew of suits over its 
sloppy handling of its water system 
and so he defends the 315mile waterway with an almost ferocious 
protectiveness using a specially built 25foot vessel to 
investigate reports of illegal discharges or catch big ships 
poaching river water 
he skulks around dumps and along the riverbanks taking 
pictures gathering evidence but he spends more time in court 
than on the river says robert boyle his boss 
at first he would say things i considered outrageous 
recalls robert f kennedy jr son of the late attorney general and 
the legal counsel for the hudson river fishermans association 
cronins employer 
hes been right so much of the time hes like a cassandra 
says kennedy 
a childrens book has been written about cronin warner bros is 
planning a commercial film about his exploits as an environmental 
knight errant and a british crew did a documentary about his work 
his success has led to the creation of a long island soundkeeper 
and a san francisco baykeeper hes been working with new york and 
new jersey to create a new york harborkeeper 
such success would have been considered unlikely in 1983 when 
cronin took the job 
he was 32 and had worked at various times and places as a 
dancer roofer dishwasher book salesman political aide and 
fisherman he didnt set foot on a boat until he was 30 he grew up 
in yonkers a major hudson city but admits he was barely aware 
of the river 
then in the early 1970s cronin encountered pete seeger who 
was trying to alert people to pollution on the hudson 
cronin signed on to the campaign after a few weeks the other 
volunteers drifted away and it was just seeger and cronin 
pretty soon hes an environmentalist seeger says 
and pretty soon he was joining with others who contended the 
tuck tape company of beacon lacked permits for all its discharges 
cronin testified before a federal grand jury and the company 
pleaded guilty to violating the clean water act 
he went on to work for us rep hamilton fish rny and for 
the state assembly committee on environmental conservation where 
he helped investigate the us armys involvement in the 
contamination of love canal 
but after a while he got tired of sitting in a building in 
albany in a suit watching the rain fall on windows that didnt 
open 
as cronin tells it he planned to take to the road and fish in 
the chesapeake he was cleaning his truck at a friends house in 
garrison not far from the river when he put his arm through a 
storm door 
arm in a sling he couldnt go anywhere thats when robert 
boyle head of the hudson river fishermans association offered 
him the riverkeepers job 
it was boyles idea to resurrect the medieval tradition a 
hudson riverkeeper was appointed in the 1970s and held the title 
briefly before quitting the post was vacant until cronin came 
along 
by the time cronin joined up in 1983 the fishermans 
association had a respectable track record of inducing polluters to 
pay into a hudson river foundation to study and maintain the river 
boyle discovered an old law prohibiting discharges in the river 
which he used to start a bag a polluter program 
it was the associations determination to save the striped bass 
that helped put a halt westway a massive highway and redevelopment 
project that was planned for manhattans west side and it was 
hrfas research that pulled the plug on con edisons proposed 
pumped storage generator project at storm king mountain 
boyle continues to marvel at his success in bringing exxon to 
justice he wiped the floor with exxon the federal government 
couldnt do it but he did 
then con edison agreed to do something about its indian point 2 
nuclear power plant sucking in fish westchester county was cited 
for contempt of court for failing to properly close its dump site 
cronin brought a halfdozen suits against the town of newburgh for 
illegal discharges 
not everyone approves robert kirkpatrick a former newburgh 
town supervisor thinks cronin isnt acting for the river but for 
himself 
i envision john cronin saying lord step aside the hudson 
river is mine you can have the rest of the world he sees himself 
as the infinite being of the hudson river says kirkpatrick 
kirkpatrick accuses cronin of harassment his aim kirkpatrick 
says is to gain publicity and to raise money to fund the 
fishermans association through settlements his targets 
kirkpatrick says actually are friends of the river 
but boyle defends the riverkeepers knack for publicity 
hes put a legal focus on the river boyle says and a 
sustained focus on the river

editors note theyre the people who have lost jobs and homes

peggy adams is an expert in raising children 
and pulling together ends that dont quite meet hunger is no 
stranger in her household 
i have seen my childrens bodies stop growing like they 
should and i pray its not their brains as well mrs adams said 
earlier this year at a senate budget committee hearing on federal 
food and nutrition programs 
it was an emotional moment 
these senators were glued to their chairs and listening to 
every word intently jeff coleman a senior income analyst for 
the committee said later you could see on the spot that people 
were being affected the questions they asked were very very 
thoughtful 
capitol hill hearings are often characterized by the relentless 
recitation of government statistics the polite drone of think tank 
researchers the familiar arguments of professional lobbyists 
even the most sensitive lawmakers can become numbed thats when 
its time to bring on the victims 
theyre the people who have lost jobs and homes gone hungry and 
suffered illness endured beatings and lived with disabilities 
theyve been scarred by foster care harassed at the office and 
traumatized by illegal abortions 
theyre very useful because theyre real they take all the 
studies and statistics and make them personal says rep george 
miller dcalif whose select committee on children youth and 
families showcases victims of everything from domestic violence to 
gang warfare 
though some may relive their agonies and humiliations to no 
avail the consensus is that any cause is strengthened by the 
testimony of an ordinary person with no ax to grind 
advocacy and research groups certainly have a place and a 
role says judith lichtman president of the womens legal 
defense fund but very often realworld hardships are more 
persuasive 
lichtmans group led the fight for a bill guaranteeing unpaid 
jobprotected leave for employees needed at home 
despite the prospect of a presidential veto congress recently 
passed the jobleave bill after three years of hearings and a 
parade of people forced out of their jobs by births adoptions or 
medical emergencies 
one man testified was assigned to a night shift at a doughnut 
bakery although he had told his boss he had to drive his infant 
daughter to a washington hospital that night she was scheduled for 
heart surgery the next day i am no hero said david wilt of 
york pa i am just a working man who was fired because he loved 
his kids 
a woman from charleston sc claimed she was assured she could 
return to her job at a retail store after a doctorordered medical 
leave during a difficult pregnancy but when she returned six weeks 
after having the baby she said she was told no jobs were 
available it hurt said liberia johnson my family needed 
the income 
dexter manley a linebacker for the washington redskins at the 
time was asked last year to discuss his learning disability at a 
hearing when he realized he could not read his prepared statement 
he broke down and cried before a battery of television cameras 
manley was later suspended from professional football for using 
drugs 
at hearings on a bill expanding federal child care programs a 
bereaved couple haltingly recalled the death of their child in 
unlicensed day care and a police officer told of finding two 
children left alone by a mother desperate to hold onto her job 
dead inside a dryer 
senators heard unusually graphic testimony this year at a 
hearing on an abortionrights bill one member of the audience 
fainted as witnesses described their illegal abortions and 
selfinduced miscarriages 
aides who orchestrate these hearings say politicians find it 
difficult to be argumentative or ideological when a victim is 
sitting in front of them 
if a woman says she thwarted the law and risked her health to 
get an illegal abortion that decisionmaking process is 
something thats hard to secondguess said kelly signs an aide 
to sen howard metzenbaum dohio

diane shust a miller aide said one house member tried to take 
on a witness at a hearing on the sandwich generation people 
who have to raise kids and care for ailing parents at the same time 
and got nowhere 
she just fired back at him she slashed his theories to 
shreds shust recalled there was no way he could counter 
there was the expert sitting in front of him 
the perfect victim someone who is genuine articulate and 
sympathetic often surfaces in a newspaper story a letter to a 
lawmaker or a list kept by an advocacy group 
signs who organized the senate abortionrights hearing said 
all the witnesses who told personal stories had already done so at 
least once before in a public forum she said it is hard to find 
women willing to talk about longago abortions 
they were not legal and were done under secretive conditions 
there may be members of their family who dont know about it 
signs said 
most advocacy groups can readily point congressional aides 
toward people who have experienced the problem they want to 
illuminate and some go even further the maryland food committee 
of baltimore has developed a talent pool of sorts a stable of 
eloquent poor people regularly dispatched to press conferences 
meetings and hearings 
coleman said the baltimore group came up with six or seven 
possible witnesses for the senate hunger hearing in february the 
two chosen were adams a white woman with nine children and mary 
tamper a black woman with two children 
adams said her family lost its income when she separated from 
her husband who made 55000 a year as an engineer he was jailed 
on child abuse charges tampers husband whose annual salary was 
30000 died of leukemia she said she had to give up her 
teachers aide job and move the family in with her mother 
coleman said the two women forced to rely on a variety of 
federal programs to feed their kids were picked with an eye toward 
breaking stereotypes 
both had been middle class he said we felt that was a 
strong message there are so many myths about who poor people are 
minorities with lots and lots of kids on welfare and food stamps 
for years we felt it was important not to perpetuate those myths 
from colemans viewpoint the hearing was a success he said its 
major recommendations to expand food stamps and a nutrition 
program for mothers and children won the support of both chairman 
jim sasser dtenn and sen pete domenici rnm the senior gop 
member of the panel the extra money may be added to the 1990 farm 
bill 
lichtman said victim witnesses also helped secure passage of a 
1988 fair housing law 
when women described being denied housing because they had kids 
that helped make the case about why we needed to prohibit 
discrimination against families with children said lichtman 
she said the same dynamics were at work when the voting rights 
act was extended in 1982 people were brought in from alabama and 
georgia and talked about what it was like to be disenfranchised or 
never enfranchised lichtman said that helped get the law 
reauthorized 
even the strongest testimony however does not always convert 
lawmakers or alter the shape of public policy 
for example sen orrin hatch rutah a strong abortion foe 
heartened some in the audience at the wrenching abortionrights 
hearing by saying he was rapidly coming to the conclusion that we 
have to do more with family planning but he still opposes a 
longsought renewal of the federal grant program for family 
planning groups because he believes theyre too enmeshed in 
providing abortion counseling and services 
lawmakers sympathized with witnesses who said theyd been fired 
for taking a couple of weeks off while their children were 
hospitalized or dying and that may be part of the reason congress 
passed a jobleave bill but the testimony failed to impress bush 
who says the government shouldnt force employers to offer any 
particular benefit 
and foster children continue to suffer neglect and abuse despite 
a little boys poignant testimony in 1987 
marcia lowry the aclu attorney who accompanied the boy to that 
hearing said at the time that agencies were not meeting federal 
requirements to monitor foster kids find permanent homes for them 
or provide services to preserve their families she also alleged an 
almost complete lack of federal supervision 
what has happened since then 
things have gotten worse said lowry director of the aclus 
childrens rights project

new kids often receive the same criticism as elvis presley who 
sang black performers songs and became far more famous than those 
who first performed them such as big mama thornton and hound 
dog but he paid to cut his first record in the style he liked 
to sing as a present for his mother 
wahlberg says the new kids grew up listening to black radio 
stations in boston i respect the roots of the music i perform 
he said i feel like im not stealing it the music i do is music 
i grew up listening to 
adolescent girls loved elvis in the 1950s the beatles in the 
60s and the rolling stones in the 70s now they adore the new 
kids 
but times have changed drugs and promiscuity are no longer in 
the new kids sing about romance lasting love and selfreliance 
wahlberg says from the stage thank you for staying drug free 
three books about the band are on paperback bestseller lists 
and fans salivate for every nugget about the quintets personal 
lives wahlberg isnt in love at the moment jonathan knight has 
the same girlfriend he had before the group started 
the story of new kids on the block dates back to 1985 in boston 
where maurice starr worked he was a man of ideas as well as a 
facile songwriter and had put together groups before none meeting 
with wild success first he thought he and his brothers could be 
another jackson 5 then he heard four young singers called the new 
edition signed them and shepherded them through their first album 
they sued him for their release and won on the basis that they 
were minors when they signed 
starr put together a trio and managed a funk quartet next he 
had the idea that a white group singing music like the new 
edition with choreography like the motown groups in their heyday 
could appeal to white as well as the new editions black listeners 
he found four boys in boston high schools none of them aiming 
toward a show business career he found 12yearold joe mcintyre 
last younger and smaller than the rest the michael jackson of the 
latterday jackson 5 idea he never abandoned 
new kids wasnt an overnight success its first record was 
marketed by columbia records to black radio which wasnt crazy 
about it a station in tampa fla aimed at white listeners picked 
up on please dont go girl from the second album hangin 
tough in march 1988 and the group took off 
starr however isnt resting on his laurels he put together a 
trio perfect gentlemen which opened new kids shows in the winter 
tour theyre 12 11 and 13 knight says just having them 
around brings back a lot of memories stuff theyre going through 
now that we went through their fans are younger than ours we have 
fans from 4 to grandmothers but predominately its 13 to 18 
on this summers tour perfect gentlemen will open again along 
with tommy page who cowrote his single ill be your 
everything with two of the new kids and the latest protege 
16yearold rick wes whom starr thinks can become another elvis 
new kids on the block are prisoners of their own fame when 
theyre on the road but jonathan knight says he doesnt mind we 
cant leave the hotel because its so crazy outside we usually 
sleep most of the day wake up around 2 and get dressed and lounge

technology has changed much for midwives 
since edwin w edwards decades away from the governors mansion 
drove his mother down the back roads of central louisiana to 
deliver babies 
but kathy acree one of louisianas seven licensed midwives 
shares much with agnes brouillette edwards including the 
willingness to take trade when clients cant pay cash 
she did 1500 deliveries in her day said mrs acree who 
has visited mrs edwards 88 she had notebooks with the date 
the babys name the parents names and what they paid her it 
would usually be a dozen eggs a chicken one time she got some 
shoes for her son 
mrs acree 40 and her partner alicia abrin charge 1000 for 
a delivery onethird to onequarter the cost of an uncomplicated 
hospital delivery the husband of one woman who couldnt pay cash 
landscaped the yard of the acree house another painted two rooms 
the money or barter covers prenatal care delivery and two 
appointments after birth 
mrs acree teaches clients how to sterilize sheets towels and 
baby clothes by baking them in the oven a technique mrs edwards 
used to sterilize bandages and gauze pads according to her 
daughter dorothy isbell of baton rouge 
youre talking about the days before antibiotics youre 
talking about the days before blood transfusions youre talking 
about the days when cesarean section was fraught with hazards 
said mrs acree those midwives as a result became very skilled 
at breech deliveries at twin deliveries at triplet deliveries 
because they had to 
i would do a breech if it was coming and i just had to do it 
but i dont feel comfortable doing them i just dont have the 
experience 
unlike mrs edwards mrs acree carries iv equipment 
antihemorrhage drugs oxygen local anesthetics and special 
suction and resuscitative devices 
both women studied under physicians although mrs edwards 
studies were informal 
her mother before her was a midwife and she taught her some 
of what she knew said mrs isbell who said mrs edwards was 
recovering from double pneumonia and not able to talk to a 
reporter to my knowledge she never had any formal training she 
learned from doing 
this didnt mean that she ignored what doctors could teach 
she had a very good relationship with the doctors in town 
they taught her what they knew and she read some of the books that 
they had said mrs isbell 
mrs acree who has a bachelors degree in speech and hearing 
therapy began her midwifery studies with an obstetrician 
when she began training 10 years ago midwives could get 
licensed by passing a written test but the law was revoked in 
1980 a law passed in 1984 and revised in 1986 requires 30 hours of 
courses needed to become a registered nurse and clinical training 
by a physician or licensed midwife before a written test is taken 
the clinical training includes 100 prenatal visits helping with 
25 births and delivering at least 15 babies examining 25 newborns 
sewing up five lacerations and observing at least five highrisk 
births 
mrs acree said that like most modern midwives she decided to 
help women have their babies at home after shed had a baby in a 
hospital 
that birth really left me with some questions about the way 
women were treated in childbirth she said they didnt allow 
fathers in the labor and delivery area it was a big ward you had 
your baby by yourself they took the baby to the nursery right away 
and you never saw your baby unless you asked 
hospitals have answered demand by setting up birthing rooms 
its nice to say oh we have this birthing room you can have 
a homelike delivery but if you go in and you still are forced to 
labor strapped to a fetal monitor with an iv in your arm youre 
limited in your options for instance in the positions that you 
want to choose to labor or give birth said mrs acree 
when mrs edwards was delivering babies there was little 
question about where they would be born the houses in rural 
avoyelles st landry and rapides parishes often were so far from a 
hospital that there was no choice 
todays midwives in louisiana each state where midwives are 
licensed has its own rules may attend only women whose doctors 
have certified that their births are likely to be uncomplicated 
they must have a doctor on call 
mrs acree said shes lucky many lafayette doctors support 
midwives she and her partner deliver about 50 babies a year 
midwives in other cities have had trouble finding medical backup 
and one yaletrained midwife has given up and enrolled in law 
school she said 
women who seek out midwives are likely to be professionals and 
college graduates motivated and willing to do the research and 
investigate alternatives 
theres also the working poor they dont have 3000 or 
4000 for a hospital delivery they dont qualify for a medicaid 
card they dont have insurance mrs acree said 
that means midwives can help reduce louisianas high infant 
mortality rate by explaining the importance of nutrition and 
prenatal care she said 
according to 1988 census bureau statistics louisiana has the 
sixth highest infant mortaility rate in the nation at 118 per 
thousand live births compared with the us average of 101 deaths 
mrs acrees experience shows attitudes may be changing even 
among people who can afford hospitals 
believe it or not in the last two years ive delivered a lot 
of patients from the medical community she said i helped two 
physicians deliver their children at home i delivered about four 
nurseanesthetists and several dozen rns 
one doctor was the female obstetrician who is mrs acrees 
backup the other she said was a physician whose wife insisted on 
having the baby at home 
he was kind of resistant unfortunately physicians are 
ingrained in fear thats a basic part of their training is to 
learn complications and fear said mrs acree thats what you 
need a doctor for if everything was fine you wouldnt need 
help 
mrs acree said she and mrs edwards also have in common a 
feeling that lasts long after delivery 
she told me that youd go down the street and in an afternoon 
youd see a dozen kids in the neighborhood that youd delivered 
they were like your kids it didnt matter what color they were 
they were still your kids your baby you had delivered them

about half the children in a study experienced 
their most severe reactions a month after a parents death but 
many others were hit hardest psychologically six months after the 
loss 
a third of children in a study showed a more severe reaction at 
that time than at one month or 13 months after the loss said dr 
elizabeth weller of ohio state university 
it seems these kids are kind of numb earlier on she said 
they dont know what hit them it takes time for them to 
assimilate what has happened 
the study focused on 38 children ages 5 to 12 twentythree had 
expected the death 
using interviews weller and colleagues looked for two dozen 
psychiatric symptoms at about one month six months and 13 months 
after the death the 13month interval was chosen to avoid 
reactions to the anniversary of the death 
about half the children showed their most severe reaction at one 
month prominent symptoms among the children at that point included 
sadness irritability impaired concentration fatigue low 
selfesteem suicidal thoughts loss of pleasure and fears that 
something would happen to the remaining parent 
at six months only sadness and irritability were noted in at 
least 40 percent of the children at 13 months no single symptom 
appeared in 40 percent of the children 
interviews with parents found they tended to underestimate the 
severity of their childrens reactions she said parents are 
overwhelmed with their own grief and children may conceal symptoms 
to protect the stressed parent she said 
weller said researchers found no way to predict which children 
would have their most severe reaction at six months 
she described the work at the recent annual meeting of the 
american psychiatric association

surgeons who thought they were removing a tumor 
discovered the problem was actually a fragment of a ballpoint pen 
that lay undetected for 22 years a report says 
the patient had sought medical help for a swelling on the side 
of his face near his right ear he said it had appeared two years 
before and steadily grown 
after xrays showed an abnormality in a salivary gland doctors 
assumed it was a benign tumor and scheduled surgery to remove it 
but the operation uncovered an inchlong fragment of a ballpoint 
pen and no evidence of tumor the patient had a normal recovery 
and left the hospital two days later 
after direct questioning the patients parents recalled a 
fight with his brother when he was 4 years old during which he was 
punctured inside the mouth with a pen that now 22 years later 
was finally removed doctors reported 
drs guillermo raspall and javier gonzalalez of the hospital 
valle de hebron in barcelona spain describe the case in the june 
issue of the journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery 
foreign bodies are only rarely discovered in salivary glands 
but other doctors have reported finding toothpicks blades of

the house today raced toward a showdown on a 
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning and speaker thomas s 
foley said failure to capture the required two thirds vote would 
doom it for the year 
whatever happens today is the final action foley declared 
at a morning news conference were not going to go around 
and around and around and around 
emotional appeals to patriotism and warnings against tampering 
with the constitutions guarantee of free speech rang out in the 
chamber as the house debate got under way 
a panoramic picture of the iwo jima memorial showing marines 
hoisting the flag over mount suribachi was brought to the floor 
beside a photo of a flaming flag in central park where the goofs 
and the goons held it up in open rebellion said rep james 
quillen rtenn 
are we so fragile as a nation that we cannot rise above such 
cheap tactics as flag burning asked rep david e skaggs 
dcolo what assurance is there that this excision in the bill of 
rights once breached would not lead to others 
foley appeared to rule out a suggestion by senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan even if the house rejected the measure the 
first time around the senate could approve it and send it back 
possibly in modified form 
we will vote today on this matter for the final time this 
session foley told a morning news conference on wednesday he 
said some of the measures supporters had given way to crass 
political opportunism and would hurt their own cause by that 
kind of egregious political snickering 
as the intensity picked up wednesday supporters promised to 
carry on their campaign even if the amendment is defeated on the 
house floor 
if they think this issue goes away on friday they have no 
comprehension of whats going on out there said republican whip 
newt gingrich of georgia and i expect that if we do lose youll 
see more anger and outrage than if we win 
backers and opponents of the amendment said it likely would not 
muster the necessary twothirds margin in the house 
president bush said wednesday in huntsville ala that a 
carefully drawn amendment to make burning of the american flag a 
crime is needed because the flag is a unique symbol 
republicans on capitol hill however grumbled that the white 
house should have done more oneonone lobbying 
democratic leaders have been campaigning against the amendment 
on grounds that it would undermine the constitutional guarantee of 
free speech 
the amendment would allow the federal government and the states 
to ban burning or otherwise desecrating the american flag 
to become part of the constitution the amendment needed 289 
votes in the house and 67 in the senate plus ratification by 38 
state legislatures 
in the senate democratic whip alan cranston of california said 
his count was 54 in favor 29 opposed and 17 on the fence 
meanwhile former federal judge robert bork was testifying today 
before the senate judiciary committee on the proposed amendment 
the house planned six hours of debate followed by a vote on the 
amendment after that the lawmakers planned to vote on a simple 
statute that would ban flag burning 
the amendment was debated heavily last year after the supreme 
court struck down a texas law that banned flag burning but 
lawmakers ultimately passed a law to ban flag burning instead of a 
constitutional amendment 
the supreme court last week declared the statute 
unconstitutional rekindling debate over the constitutional 
amendment 
house debate took on an acid tone wednesday as rep gerald 
solomon rny told critics that in pushing for a quick vote they 
were gagging 10 million veterans through this nation and 
kowtowing to ilk like the communist youth brigade 
democrats objected and solomon eventually apologized the 
remarks were stricken from the record 
the sharp words however underlined the intensity of emotions 
in the house over the issue foley asked about gingrichs remarks 
said some sponsors are concerned apparently about the political 
issue and the political opportunities they think this represents 
i dont think the american people are going to respond 
favorably to that foley said what i dont think they are 
going to appreciate and support is crass political opportunism a 
kind of wringing their hands gleefully and saying this is where we 
are going to clean up 
veterans groups had sought to mount a grassroots lobbying 
campaign for the amendment but were caught off guard by the swift 
move to whisk the bill to the house floor 
we fail to see why it is so necessary to rush this legislation 
to a vote on thursday said walter g hogan national commander 
of the veterans of foreign wars

a kohlberg kravis roberts amp co plan to 
recapitalize rjr nabisco inc bolstered its junk bonds and 
indicated the food and tobacco company will be left intact and 
eventually returned to public ownership 
under the tentative plan announced wednesday kohlberg kravis 
would retire a large part of the 6 billion in junk bonds it used 
to buy the food and tobacco company in a record 2453 billion 
buyout last year 
the buyout firm plans to inject fresh equity into rjr nabisco 
and raise bank loans to retire the bonds kohlberg kravis also 
would issue preferred stock convertible into common stock in rjr 
nabisco 
the plan is likely to lower returns for kohlberg kravis and its 
investors but it would avert the prospect of rjr nabisco having to 
pay sharply higher interest rates on its junk bond debt next year 
the equity injection and sale of stock also could counter any 
notions that kohlberg kravis might dismantle rjr nabisco as it did 
after with beatrice co 
beatrice once owned such wellknown businesses as the avis car 
rental company tropicana juice products hunt and wesson foods 
samsonite luggage swift meats and playtex personal products 
between its 61 billion acquisition of beatrice in 1985 and 
this month when the conglomerates remaining food operations were 
sold kohlberg kravis divested the company piece by piece in the 
process the buyout firm and its investors reaped a fat 50 percent 
return on their original equity investment 
rjr nabisco also has a variety of food lines and a separate 
tobacco business but analysts say that while beatrice was ripe for 
a breakup rjr nabisco is not 
beatrice had this and that a lot of things that didnt make 
sense to have together anyway said jack maxwell an analyst who 
follows rjr nabisco for wheat first securities inc in richmond 
va 
rjr nabisco has product lines that conceivably could be pared 
but maxwell said he doubted kohlberg kravis would begin unloading 
food divisions and you cant sell bits and pieces of the tobacco 
business very well 
since its buyout rjr has divested 566 billion in assets to 
pare its debt which now stands at 22 billion its del monte 
canned foods and fresh fruit businesses and some foreign holdings 
were among those sold 
but said maxwell theyve sold pretty much what they want to 
sell 
in its announcement rjr nabisco said kohlberg kravis would 
invest an additional 17 billion in the company as part of the 
recapitalization 
analysts see rjr nabisco returning to public ownership in the 
next few years that is the route taken by another kohlberg kravis 
holding safeway stores inc 
after safeway went private in a 1986 leveraged buyout the 
supermarket company began hammering away at its debt and 
streamlined operations this past february the company announced a 
modest initial offering of 10 million shares 
rjr nabisco also said it was negotiating new loans with banks 
the company said it expected to begin enacting the recapitalization 
by the end of july 
the plan is intended to take off the market some of rjr 
nabiscos junk bonds which declined sharply in value earlier this 
year a buyback of the bonds would allow kohlberg kravis to 
sidestep provisions requiring the firm to guarantee the price of 
the bonds by next april 
rjr nabisco bonds rose sharply wednesday on word of the 
recapitalization gaining as much as 625 per 100 in face value 
kohlberg kravis investors mostly are large pension funds that 
generally do not have an active voice in the management of the 
companies they own including rjr nabisco officials of several 
funds declined to comment on what theyd like to see happen to rjr 
nabisco 
but several said they were satisfied with management 
david weig executive director of the washington state 
investment board said he was absolutely happy with the 
management at rjr nabisco and with kohlberg kravis 
oregon state pension officials also said they were happy we 
have had excellent returns from these kinds of investments said

the sagging defense industry has dealt another 
blow to the nations top two defense contractors 
mcdonnell douglas corp announced plans wednesday for major 
layoffs to help pare at least 700 million a year from its costs 
and general dynamics corp had its credit rating cut by a major 
rating agency 
the developments at the two st louisbased companies came one 
day after defense secretary dick cheney proposed a 25 percent cut 
in the nations military spending 
the proposed cuts would affect mcdonnell douglas harpoon and 
tomahawk missiles and the f15 and fa18 jet fighters general 
dynamics makes f16 fighter jets for the air force m1 tanks for 
the army and ssn688 submarines for the navy 
moodys investors service inc which downgraded general 
dynamics credit rating said the manufacturers of defense 
platforms planes tanks submarines will be the most severely 
affected by reduced defense spending 
officials at mcdonnell douglas the nations biggest defense 
contractor said they didnt know yet how many of the companys 
127000 workers might lose their jobs 
however sources at the company and in washington said they had 
been told about 4000 of mcdonnells 40500 employees in st louis 
will be cut nationwide the company probably will lay off 7000 to 
8000 people one source said 
the hard reality is we must begin immediately to take further 
strong actions to reduce our costs john f mcdonnell the 
companys chairman and chief executive said in a letter to 
employees 
he added that to reduce costs by the desired amount will 
entail substantial layoffs across the corporation the company 
will not offer voluntary retirement packages as part of the cuts 
he said 
mcdonnell already has announced plans to lay off 4000 workers 
and 3000 contracted workers at its douglas aircraft co in long 
beach and torrance calif douglas aircraft its production behind 
schedule on the c17 military cargo plane and the md80 jetliner 
has lost 306 million in the past 15 months 
mcdonnell said the costcutting plan should be in place by early 
august with immediate steps being taken on overtime travel new 
hiring consultants advertising and support activities 
the layoffs are likely to be focused on the companys salaried 
and administrative ranks rather than on production workers 
officials indicated 
industry analyst paul nisbet of prudentialbache in new york 
said the layoffs are a sign of transition rather than severe 
trouble at mcdonnell douglas 
nisbet estimated the company has a backlog of over 50 billion 
in commercial aircraft orders he predicted mcdonnells sales would 
reach 162 billion this year and 20 billion by 1992 compared 
with 1458 billion in 1989 
the layoffs represent just a shift in business from what 
predominantly was a military market in the 80s to a predominantly 
commercial market in the 90s nisbet said theyre just having 
trouble digesting it 
in addition to programs that would be affected by the proposed 
defense cuts chairman mcdonnell wrote employees that the company 
faces potential serious cost problems on its a12 advanced 
tactical aircraft the c17 airlifter and t45a goshawk trainer 
programs 
moodys cited sagging conditions in the defense industry in 
dropping its credit ratings by two notches on general dynamics the 
nations no 2 defense contractor 
the action dropped the companys senior debt from a2 to baa1 and 
its subordinated debt from a3 to baa2 the new ratings put the 
bonds in the bottom category of investment grade 
fred pastore an associate director at moodys said the 
downgrade reflected the companys decreased amount of readily 
available cash as well as its vulnerability to defense cuts 
spokesman pete connolly said general dynamics was disappointed 
with the downgrade we feel we have both a strong balance sheet 
and a strong balance of business which will sustain us through this 
period he said 
in addition to its military business the company owns cessna 
aircraft co and makes a launch rocket used to put satellites into 
orbit

chase manhattan corp said it would appoint a 
new chairman as part of an early management shakeup that officials 
indicated would include cutbacks in the corporate finance area 
current president thomas g labrecque 51 will replace willard 
c butcher 63 as chairman and chief executive officer effective 
oct 31 the nations secondlargest bank holding company said 
wednesday 
the change is part of a wave of cutbacks by major investment and 
commercial banks to cope with a downturn in the market for mergers 
acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that flourished on wall street 
in the 1980s 
in an interview labrecque said he and butcher recommended the 
change to the banks board of directors the succession had been 
expected but he said the timing was being accelerated to implement 
changes in corporate finance 
chase manhattan which ranks behind citicorp in terms of assets 
has 41000 employees worldwide 27 percent of them in corporate 
finance 
what we really have to restructure is our corporate finance 
capabilities in terms of its size worldwide and the integration of 
it worldwide he said the question is the size of the 
infrastructure to support the level of business being done 
the assumption should not be that were getting out of the 
business he said its anything but that 
labrecque declined to specify changes but said the bank would 
have more to say next week 
other banks that engage in wholesale lending to large 
corporations and corporate finance also are reducing their staff 
sizes 
bankers trust new york corp said monday it is cutting 10 
percent of its corporate finance department or 75 jobs 
manufacturers hanover corp also is expected to reduce its domestic 
and foreign corporate finance operations and already has announced 
a restructuring of its wholesale banking business 
labrecque said chase which recently sold subsidiaries in the 
netherlands and belgium planned to retain a presence in the more 
than 50 countries in which it now operates 
he also said restructuring efforts would focus on the banks 
loan problems which contributed to a 66 percent decline in 
firstquarter earnings to 44 million from 132 million in the same 
1989 period 
the bank said its earnings were hurt by a 75 million increase 
in provisions for losses from bad loans mostly because of 
deterioration in some us commercial real estate markets 
the company added 225 million to reserves against possible loan 
losses in the first quarter up from 150 million a year ago and 
130 million in the 1989 fourth quarter 
the bank said it wrote off 325 million in bad loans in the 
quarter including 114 million to third world countries up from a 
total of 159 million in the yearago period 
butcher issued a statement saying the executive change was a 
natural step in implementing an orderly management succession which 
has been under way since early 1988 he joined chase in 1947 and 
was elected chairman in 1981 
we have accelerated the process because there are a series of 
business challeneges requiring organizational changes that could 
not be implemented until the issue of management succession was 
resolved the statement read 
in addition chase said vice chairman arthur f ryan would 
become president and chief operating officer of chase manhattan 
corp and chase manhattan bank 
labrecque joined chase in 1964 and was elected vice chairman and 
chief operating office in 1980 and president in 1984

demands for minimum employment levels in exchange for improved 
income guarantees for most workers union president owen bieber 
said 
much of the job shrinkage the companies are confronting us 
with is not inevitable and we should fight it and try to reverse 
it bieber told the uaws ford council in indianapolis on 
wednesday 
contracts covering about 500000 active and laidoff workers at 
ford motor co general motors corp and chrysler corp expire 
sept 14 
under a big three proposal the uaw would scrap a requirement 
for automakers to hire one new worker for every two who retire 
quit or die in exchange automakers would have expanded income 
maintenance programs 
many automotive analysts have said the big three cant remain 
competitive with the number of hourly workers they currently employ 
bieber said the union acknowledges that job reductions are 
necessary but refused to discuss how or when the union would permit 
them until talks open next month 
bieber also called on ford to reverse its growing reliance on

the travelers corp says it will stop 
selling automobile and homeowners insurance policies in nine states 
where business has been slow in order to focus on more profitable 
markets 
in todays competitive environment we must preserve our 
capital for only the very best business opportunities and that 
requires increasingly higher standards of performance said 
ronald e foley senior vice president for personal lines at 
travelers 
the hartfordbased company said wednesday it will stop writing 
automobile and homeowners policies in south carolina north dakota 
south dakota wyoming west virginia nevada idaho arkansas and 
oklahoma the move takes effect immediately in some states said 
richard fly a travelers spokesman 
fly said the company will begin phasing out existing policies in 
november he said travelers had no figures on how many customers 
the decision would affect 
generally those states have proven to be unprofitable to us 
fly said our strategy for some time has been to concentrate on 
those states where we see the possibility for future and longterm 
growth 
the company also said it has reduced the number of independent 
agents selling its personal insurance policies and revamped its 
agent commission schedule paying them on a performance scale 
instead of a flat commission beginning jan 1 
fly said the decision will have no immediate impact on the 
companys staff although the company will evaluate whether layoffs 
are needed as the withdrawals take place 
the company said it has reduced its agent force by about 900 
over the past year 
analysts predict that the changes will not have much effect on 
consumers in the states travelers is leaving 
other insurance companies are going to be able to handle those 
policies with not much of a ripple in the market said alvin 
parsons vice president of the american insurance association a 
washington dcbased insurance lobby 
travelers said earlier this year it was evaluating its 
homeowners and automobile businesses nationwide the company has 
already withdrawn from the automobile insurance field in 
california and stopped writing new policies in pennsylvania it 
said it would carefully choose customers in other states 
travelers is one of a growing number of major insurers who have 
decided to cut or abandon personal lines of insurance because of 
what they say are declining profits and increased meddling by state 
regulators and lawmakers 
other insurers making drastic changes include xerox corps crum 
and forster insurance division aetna life and casualty co and 
the hartford insurance group philadelphiabased cigna corp the 
new hampshire insurance group and continental corp in new york 
travelers lost 13 million in 1989 on its personal lines 
business which includes automobile and homeowners policies fly 
said he said the nine states affected accounted for 42 million in 
premiums in 1989 about four percent of the companys 17 billion 
in personal lines premiums 
robert rusbuldt an assistant vice president with the 
independent insurance agents of america a lobby for independent 
agents said the decision was not surprising 
insurance companies have been looking at automobile 
insurance as a loss leader he said the loss has been getting 
so bad in certain states that its just not worth it anymore 
parsons blamed deteriorating business climates for travelers 
move 
if you look at the nine states they are small markets and 
travelers may have decided that it was not worthwhile writing 
business there he said

after years of seeing strong growth in the 
number of passengers flying around the united states the aviation 
industry is trying to figure out why air travel is actually down in 
some key markets 
despite the slowdown now in its third year industry groups 
still predict that strong growth will create a critical demand for 
new airports and more runways by the end of the century 
air travel within the united states increased only 1 percent in 
1989 while the number of passengers boarding international flights 
from us airports went up 11 percent the airport operators 
council international said in a report wednesday travel was up 
138 percent in pacific rim countries and 7 percent in europe 
an accompanying report by the partnership for improved air 
travel said aviations contribution to the economy hit nearly 600 
billion in 1989 a 138 percent increase over the last study which 
covered 1987 but most of the growth was in commercial aircraft 
manufacturing rather than in domestic airline operations 
jobs payroll and other economic factors involving the 
manufacture of airliners went up 22 percent over the two years the 
report said 
aviations share of the gross national product has remained 
steady at 56 percent said the partnership a wideranging group 
of industry and aviationinterest groups set up to ensure that us 
aviation meets future demands 
the reports by the partnership and the airport operators were 
released at a joint news conference 
george howard president of the airport operators group blamed 
slow overall economic growth higher fares and the impact of the 
eastern airlines strike for the stalled growth in domestic 
passengers 
he said inadequate capacity at larger airports also may be 
suppressing the growth in traffic as they simply run out of room 
for additional flights 
there is evidence of a shift in the growth of traffic to 
smaller airports where capacity while still a large concern is 
still somewhat more available howard said 
the airport group released its annual traffic report of each of 
the worlds major airports it showed three of four airports in the 
highestdensity markets new yorks kennedy and laguardia and 
washingtons national actually lost traffic in 1989 
the fourth chicagos ohare showed only a 06 percent increase 
but remained the worlds busiest airport with just over 59 million 
passengers boarding flights last year the report said 
dallasfort worth surpassed los angeles and atlanta for second 
place atlantas hartsfield airport fell to fourth from second 
primarily because of the strike against eastern which uses atlanta 
as a hub howard said 
new york with three major airports continued to be the worlds 
most heavily traveled market followed by chicago and london 
federal aviation administration figures compiled by the airport 
organization showed 4156 million emplanements for domestic flights 
in 1989 4142 million in 1988 and 4155 in 1987 
aviation officials indicated they did not expect the growth to 
be so flat but they pointed out the still significant increase in 
enplanements since 1983 when they totaled 2907 million 
our traffic results for 1989 might indicate a slight weakening 
in the growth rate of aviation for the year but we foresee a 61 
percent increase in passenger traffic by 2000 howard said 
he said the airport group predicts that 76 percent of all us 
air travelers will face delays if the capacity of the nations 
system of airports is not increased

switzerland for centuries an island of peace in 
troubled europe is increasingly haunted by fears of isolation in 
an emerging supercontinent 
the wealthy country has traditionally regarded itself as a 
special case treasuring its muchvaunted neutrality and 
stability that has helped attract capital from all over the world 
but as the newly democratic states of eastern europe look toward 
the 12nation european community for economic deals and political 
cooperation swiss leaders do not hide their worries about being 
left out 
it would be like being the only one in a school class not 
invited to join the soccer team said franz blankart 
switzerlands chief negotiator in talks on european integration 
pressure for full ec membership is increasing from companies 
anxious to share the economic benefits promised by the removal of 
trade barriers at the end of 1992 
at the same time however there are loud warnings from 
conservative groups that ec membership would jeopardize 
switzerlands independence and its system of direct democracy under 
which the people have the final say on all key legislation 
the government says its not ready to join the ec instead it is 
engrossed in complex talks aimed at a farreaching agreement 
between the powerful community and the sixnation european free 
trade association 
switzerland austria norway sweden iceland and finland are 
members of the loosely knit efta austria already has applied for 
ec membership swallowing fears for its neutrality 
the talks with the community are meant to lead to the creation 
of the european economic space ees providing for the free 
movement of goods people capital and services among the 18 
european countries and creating a market of 350 million people 
of all the efta members switzerland is the most dependent on 
the ec for trade according to government figures 57 percent of 
swiss exports went to ec countries last year and 74 percent of 
swiss imports came from the ec 
but the path toward creating a super european market has been 
rocky swiss demands for exemptions from certain provisions 
demonstrate the problems that would beset an application for full 
swiss membership of the community 
for example the government wants to keep the right to limit the 
influx of foreigners into a land where some 15 percent of the 65 
million population are nonswiss full ec membership would rule 
this out 
switzerland also could be forced to change its system for 
holding national referendums 
the ec also has objected to giving switzerland and others in the 
european free trade association an equal say in the decisionmaking 
process increasing speculation that the negotiations will end in 
failure 
the swiss government says in such an event there would be two 
scenarios a goitalone policy or full ec membership 
the goitalone policy for me is an unrealistic solution 
says swiss foreign minister rene felber the consequences would 
be isolation which would be unbearable for a land in the middle of 
europe with all our economic cultural and social connections 
the powerful farming lobby doesnt share this concern it is 
opposed to ec membership fearing a drop in agricultural prices and 
an opening of markets which are currently protected 
by contrast a government report has said that business concerns 
would on the whole benefit from ec membership 
experts say this is especially true of mediumsized companies 
the largest swiss banks and multinationals like nestle sa already 
have secured footholds throughout the ec 
economics minister jeanpascal delamuraz says ec membership is a 
longterm option but dismisses pressure for an immediate 
application as premature 
a proec grouping of politicians businessmen and publishers 
plans to launch a proposal on community membership to gain the 
100000 signatures required under swiss law for a national 
referendum a vote in favor of the proposed constitutional 
amendment would force the government to open formal talks with the 
ec 
one group opposed to joining the ec the action for an 
independent and neutral switzerland says the country will lose out 
in the european integration process and its democratic traditions 
will suffer 
freedom and independence until death reads one of the more 
extreme slogans at a recent meeting of the group 
political leaders do not underestimate the influence of the 
groups movement and still flinch at memories of voters rejection 
in 1986 of a proposal to join the united nations 
officials refuse to speculate on what will happen if a national 
referendum throws out the proposed ecefta accord 
there is more fear of isolationism now than 1986 contends 
felber we have to be optimistic we have to believe we are 
european

for japanese the word zaibatsu conjures up 
images of sacrifice and dedication to the lost cause of global 
domination during world war ii 
the zaibatsu huge holding companies that funded and armed 
japans war effort were dismantled more than 40 years ago but 
the even more powerful business alliances that arose in their place 
are coming under fire both at home and abroad for some of their 
business practices 
those alliances which have helped make japan one of the worlds 
biggest economic powers have become a prime target in trade 
negotiations with the united states 
talks in tokyo scheduled for monday and tuesday are expected to 
produce an agreement on curbing business practices that us 
officials say exclude outsiders and unfairly control markets 
the zaibatsu which had included mitsui mitsubishi yasuda and 
sumitomo launched modern industry here in the late 19th century 
their descendants span industries ranging from real estate to 
precision instruments 
the japanese remain uncomfortably aware of the latent power of 
these corporate behemoths in 1945 the zaibatsu controlled a 
quarter of the nations capital half its financial sector and at 
least a third of its heavy industry 
the six largest groups still account for about onequarter of 
both the assets and sales of all nonfinancial firms according to 
the fair trade commission japans antimonopoly watchdog 
major deals by two of the biggest of the groups mitsubishi and 
mitsui recently raised speculation that the zaibatsu was being 
resurrected 
the outcry began when the mitsubishi group announced plans in 
march for cooperation with west german aerospace and auto 
conglomerate daimlerbenz ag the tieup was seen as a bold move to 
further fortify japans top trader and defense contractor 
an announcement april 10 of a merger between mitsubishi mining 
and cement co and mitsubishi metal corp two group firms divided 
after the war raised further apprehensions 
the new nationalism of the mitsubishi zaibatsu trumpeted 
aera a weekly magazine of the asahi newspaper mitsubishis 
zaibatsu resurrection a dangerous gamble said the tokyo 
shimbun one of several newspapers that criticized the move 
the mitsui group also raised eyebrows with a merger between 
mitsui bank and taiyo kobe bank a combination that formed the 
worlds secondlargest bank in terms of deposits 
mitsubishi officials vigorously denied any attempts to 
reestablish their zaibatsu those claims are absolutely 
untrue said mitsubishi spokesman hiroshi ogawa 
not just former zaibatsu companies are coming under fire 
today there are about 150 major industrial groups in japan 
according to toyo keizai an authoritative financial publishing 
house 
the groups are loosely identified as keiretsu or 
affiliations corporate families bound by mutual shareholdings and 
other financial ties as well as cooperative business strategies 
the zaibatsu are like dinosaurs there arent any but the 
keiretsu are a tricky problem said james c abegglan a business 
consultant and professor at sophia university in tokyo 
some keiretsu are grouped around banks others group 
subcontractors around major manufacturers like sony corp and 
matsushita retailers in turn are linked to producers with ties 
that ensure stable trustworthy business relationships 
many economists believe that without keiretsu the nations 
entire justintime system of production and supply the key to its 
competitiveness in world markets would fall apart 
if the japanese are told they must abandon this sort of 
approach the very vitality of japanese corporations will be 
seriously damaged said economist iwao nakatani of osaka 
university in western japan 
japanese rewrote antitrust rules to allow firms to have cross 
holdings to protect desirable firms from hostile takeover bids 
former zaibatsu companies tend to keep about 30 percent of their 
shares in crossholdings the fair trade commission says 
these longterm lasting relationships make the japanese 
system more efficient said abegglan the sophia university 
professor 
but some smaller group members are beginning to chafe at the 
price of corporate kinship 
businessmen speaking confidentially say bigname firms at the 
top of the manufacturing pyramid squeeze their smaller 
subcontractors mercilessly 
once youre part of an industrial group you have no secrets 
your bank is the groups bank and your companys financial details 
are available on request to senior group members one president 
of a small group of electronics firms told business tokyo 
magazine 
the japanese subcontractor isnt in love with his parent 
company hes just tied to it by tradition and the threat of losing 
his business he said 
foreign firms criticize large manufacturers for establishing 
exclusive outlets for their own products offering retailers 
rebates and other incentives to sell items at listed prices and 
penalizing stores that sell at a discount or carry other brands 
on june 6 the fair trade commission issued new guidelines that 
prohibit manufacturers from pressuring discount shops that sell 
goods at below manufacturerrecommended prices the commission also 
has said it will tighten controls on bidrigging and pricefixing 
and raise penalties for illegal cartels 
finance ministry officials say they also are discussing wider 
requirements for financial disclosure of dealings among keiretsu 
members wider disclosure would give shareholders more control over 
their investments 
fuller disclosure is one of the changes texas oilman t boone 
pickens has been demanding in his own battle against keiretsu 
pickens owns the largest share in koito manufacturing co a 
major auto parts maker linked to toyota motor corp he has been 
demanding so far unsuccessfully a say in the firms management 
industry and government officials say they dont intend to 
dismantle the industrial groups but they are clearly coming under 
stricter scrutiny 
the key issue said economist nakatani is how to preserve the 
system that works so well for japan while opening it to outsiders 
the keiretsu need to consider the feelings of outsiders 
said nakatani theyve always done things for the sake of 
japanese and excluded foreigners 
now they are multinational companies and they cant afford to 
ignore the rest of the world

the deepset colors and intricate mexican 
designs of pressed concrete tile once could be found in homes and 
buildings all over san antonio 
thanks to a childhood fascination of designer bill demaree the 
art form that began to vanish with the advent of linoleum and 
carpet is making a vibrant return as demand for the matte tiles 
spreads across the continent 
demaree a selfemployed designer hit hard by the sluggish texas 
economy set out five years ago to find artisans to make the 
unusual tile which features colored geometric designs 
demaree had been intrigued with the tiles as a child when he 
spent hours on the floor of his familys san antonio home studying 
the old cement pieces 
i decided to go to mexico and see if there was anybody left 
who knew how to make them he said it was about a threeyear 
period in doing the research 
in san luis demaree came upon craftsmen trained by older family 
members to make tiles demaree fondly refers to them as the 
masters 
there are some people that somehow dont even think about it 
it is part of their being said demaree who now runs a 23worker 
tilemaking factory in san luis and an apprentices school he 
established these people grew up and learned from their father 
their uncle what have you 
demaree said the tile making dates to 1726 when it is believed 
vatican artisans created the first pressed concrete tile 
the tiles were used for wall decorations in vatican chapels 
early molds were made of wood and hammering was used instead of 
hydraulic pressing which came into use in the 1840s 
demaree said use of the tiles followed the production of 
portland cement at one point san antonio boasted the 
secondlargest portland cement plant in the united states and the 
tiles were widely used here 
the peak of pressed tile production in the united states lasted 
from about 1900 to 1928 san antonios bexar county courthouse 
built in 1891 used the tiles on its floors most of it remains in 
good shape 
but the depression world war ii and the growing popularity of 
linoleum and carpeting led to a decline in us tile use the tiles 
remained popular in mexico where solidcolored pieces often are 
found in the floors of lowcost housing 
demaree said basically nothing about tile making has changed 
since the 1840s except that color quality gradually has improved 
craftsman use two types of concrete portland cement for the 
tile base and white portland to create colors 
cement of precisely the right consistency must be poured into a 
mold at exactly the right depth to prevent colors from running 
together when the mold eventually is pulled out 
tile makers smooth the backs of the pieces with a straightedge 
and then use hydraulics to apply air pressure of 3000 pounds per 
square inch for three or four seconds to two heavy metal plates 
that sandwich the tile the hydraulic pressure bonds the sections 
of cement together for strength 
as much as 10 percent of the tiles dont survive the 28day 
process which includes drying the pieces overnight then submerging 
them in water for days 
the tiles range in size from 3 inches by 3 inches to 1 foot by 1 
foot prices range from 3 to 12 per square foot different tile 
patterns have names like saltillo star arabesque lattice 
victoria and even bahama mama 
about two years ago demaree joined with san antoniobased 
materials marketing corp to sell the product which he ships to 
san antonio for the company to farm out to distributors 
materials marketing which also sells other products from 
mexico has been peddling the tiles for about a year through 60 
distributors in the united states and canada 
a few other craftsmen and companies in the united states are 
showing interest in selling the tiles but materials marketing 
claims its operation is the biggest sales figures are not yet 
available

the nations economy grew at a 19 percent 
annual rate from january through march the second slowest 
quarterly advance in more than three years the government said 
today 
the commerce department said the increase in the broadest 
measure of the nations economic health the gross national 
product was up from the 11 percent rate in the final quarter of 
1989 that had been the slowest advance since a 08 percent gain in 
the summer of 1986 
at the same time inflation as a price index tied to the gnp 
rose 64 percent at an annual rate it was an improvement from the 
67 percent increase reported last month and the 65 percent 
advance originally reported in april 
the inflation rate was the highest since it raced ahead at an 
annual rate of 77 percent in the final quarter of 1981 however 
most economists attributed the jump in the januarymarch period to 
the adverse effects of unusual winter weather and predicted prices 
would decline during the remainder of the year 
the new gnp figure for the first quarter approached the 21 
percent gain in the departments original estimate in april that 
estimate was lowered last month to 13 percent 
most economists had expected little change from the may figure 
the economy advanced 30 percent in 1989 down from 44 percent 
a year earlier 
despite the slower growth most economists believe the economy 
will continue to skirt a recession generally defined as two 
straight declines in the gnp 
in fact the federal reserve released a survey on wednesday 
indicating the economy continued to grow sluggishly through the 
first part of june although recessionary pockets were found in 
some sectors 
the firstquarter growth rate was less than the bush 
administrations 24 percent estimate earlier this year to meet 
that goal the economy would have to spurt ahead 26 percent at an 
annual rate during the remaining nine months 
commerce said the improvement in todays report was due mainly 
to 68 billion more in net exports than previously thought at the 
same time consumer spending was 53 billion less than estimated 
last month 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
totalling 4193 trillion after the first three months of the year 
in a companion report the department said aftertax profits of 
us corporations were up a revised 11 percent in the first 
quarter after rising 28 percent in the final three months of 1989 
it originally reported that profits had risen only 02 percent 
corporate profits had fallen during each of the first three 
quarters of last year including a 11 percent drop during the 
comparable months of january through march 
in its report on wednesday the fed said its survey of its 12 
district banks suggests slow growth in the economy with little 
change in the underlying inflation rate 
the survey completed on june 8 shows that the manufacturing 
sector remains flat but is showing signs of improvement in some 
areas including some strengthening in the sluggish automobile 
industry 
the construction industry on the other hand has been edging 
downward in recent months in most districts and indicators of 
future construction suggest further softening the survey found 
the manufacturing and construction sectors have felt the brunt 
of the feds tightcredit policies as the central bank sought for 
more than a year to stem inflation by slowing the economy without 
tilting it into a recession 
the fed survey found very little growth if not a decline in 
real consumer spending for durable and nondurable goods this 
quarter from last 
consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity and has been a driving force for the economy for 
much of the last eight years 
recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in 
several districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent 
months and are expected to remain so in the short term the 
summary said 
retail sales representing about a half of overall consumer 
spending slid in the final month of the first quarter and 
continued to fall for two more months it was the first time that 
has happened since the fall of 1981 during the last recession 
the survey found indications of continued growth in capital 
goods industries another area of strength in recent months 
prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a 
result of ample rainfall in previously droughtstricken regions of 
the country the survey found but cool wet weather has 
delayed planting by as much as several weeks 
the survey results were similar to the three previous polls 
conducted this year that found slow but continued economic 
expansion with moderate inflation the latest was conducted by the 
cleveland district bank for use at the july 23 meeting of the 
central banks federal open market committee which establishes us 
monetary policy

the supreme court today stripped the 
interstate commerce commission of its authority to relieve shippers 
of their legal obligation to pay carriers less than their official 
rates 
the justices by a 72 vote said the icc policy violates the 
103yearold interstate commerce act 
the act requires carriers to file rate schedules with the 
commission showing how much is charged for services once such a 
rate schedule is filed a carrier cannot charge more or less than 
what it states 
but the commission which regulates interstate trucking and has 
the authority to approve or disapprove tariff proposals adopted a 
policy in 1986 that carved out an exception 
the policy stated that it was an unreasonable billing practice 
for a trucking company to first charge a customer a negotiated rate 
and later seek to recover the difference between that rate and the 
filed rate schedule 
quinn freight lines a subsidiary of maislin industries shipped 
1081 truckloads of steel for primary steel based in north haven 
conn 
the rates quinn charged primary for the shipment were lower than 
the rate schedule maislin had filed with the commission 
after maislin filed for bankruptcy protection in 1983 its 
auditors determined that quinn had undercharged primary by nearly 
188000 maislin sued primary in federal court in kansas city to 
collect the money 
us district judge john w oliver referred the dispute to the 
icc seeking a determination as to whether primary should be forced 
to pay 
the commission ruled that it would be an unreasonable 
practice to require primary to pay for the difference between the 
negotiated and filed rates on the basis of that finding judge 
oliver dismissed maislins suit and the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals upheld the dismissal 
todays ruling reinstated the suit 
although the commission has both the authority and expertise 
generally to adopt new policies when faced with new developments in 
the industry justice william j brennan wrote it does not 
have the power to adopt a policy that directly conflicts with its 
governing statute 
brennan said that if the commission wants to use its policy 
it is the responsibility of congress to modify or eliminate 
those provisions in the interstate commerce act now preventing such 
use 
chief justice william h rehnquist and john paul stevens 
dissented 
the case is maislin industries vs primary steel 89624

action was limited to range trading 
political and economic uncertainties over the soviet union 
eastern europe and the unification of east and west germany helped 
to underpin the dollar they said 
dealers also said the market was waiting for fridays report on 
us durable goods to confirm impressions of an economic slowdown 
worries that a slower us economy will soon translate into lower 
interest rates has been cited as a factor that may influence the 
dollar

hey buddy want a free rollsroyce 
all you do see is buy this mansion in brentwood brand new 
pool spa sauna stupendous views five bedrooms seven baths 
maids quarters three quarters of an acre 
just 38 million 11 million off the original asking price 
well also throw in a convertible 1990 corniche iii at no extra 
charge 
that deal outlined this month in a hollywood reporter 
advertisement is an extreme example of a host of homesales 
gimmicks in expensive california areas where reality has hit 
realty after a remarkable boom in sales and prices in the late 
1980s 
weve never seen as many incentives as now said mike 
silverman a veteran beverly hills broker who has sold houses for 
celebrities like judy garland and pia zadora 
all the brokers are scratching their heads everyone has been 
spoiled by all of these good years 
during 1988 and much of 1989 home prices soared at a clip of 
more than 20 percent per year in areas like san francisco los 
angeles orange county ventura and santa barbara in many cases 
all a broker had to do was list a house to sell it usually at a 
premium price 
now despite booming price increases in cheaper inland areas 
the median price of a california home actually fell to 197107 in 
april 1990 from 201034 in april 1989 according to the california 
association of realtors 
theres a glut of homes on the market too 
in the san fernando valley section of los angeles for example 
the realtors group said 13561 homes were for sale in may a 56 
percent jump from last year the average sales price was 306400 
but only the under300000 market was still hot the trade group 
said 
no one has suggested that residential property values will 
plummet as they have in the northeast recently or the oil states a 
few years back but observers such as norman katz a thrift 
consultant with grant thorntons mcs associates believe home 
prices might fall 15 percent below their peak 
responding to the slowdown developers have been cutting prices 
theyre also paying closing costs picking up months of house 
payments or offering tradein programs to help sell a buyers 
old home 
some buyers are even getting free vacations fully furnished 
homes or upgrades brokers who list expensive properties for sale 
are offering luxury cars and 10000 bonuses to agents who close 
deals 
incentives aside many experts say now is a good time to buy a 
home californias economy remains strong and housing prices are 
poised to rebound since builders are starting fewer projects 
lessening the risk of an oversupply 
for now though the biggest job is getting wouldbe buyers 
through the front door 
stephen ellis the broker whos giving away the rolls with his 
fivebedroom mansion said lowering the price didnt seem to work 
maybe the idea of the rolls will get somebody else up here i 
just want to get my money out he said 
ellis said he began building that home for his family five years 
ago but hassles with the city over its construction delayed it so 
long that his twin daughters are nearly college age now 35 
million later his 7000squarefoot dream home is too big for just 
a couple he said 
ellis said his rollsroyce gimmick has generated no serious 
offers so far 
but silverman the beverly hills broker said hes been able to 
peddle luxury homes by offering offbeat perks 
hell fly buyers around in helicopters cater meals and pay 
roundtrip tabs to new york and hawaii to sell homes he 
giftwrapped one house and swears another sold when a hungry buyer 
went to an open house because it had a free lunch 
it gives a little pizzazz to the promotion silverman said 
i read an ad that said for sale important fish tank included 
with the fish tank is a threebedroom house 
its like when you get junk mail some people put some really 
extraordinary copy on there that will make you open it 
not everyone is a fan of such pizzazz 
the best incentive is to price the house right said fred 
sands the founder of californias largest oneowner real estate 
brokerage for a while there you could price a house 30 percent 
over market value and in six months prices would catch up you 
cant do that now 
sands said he discourages most incentives 
gimmicks are gimmicks theyre mainly to make the sellers feel 
good he said the biggest incentive is to drop the price 
a lot of times it just makes people suspicious kay pick a 
silverman agent said of incentives they figure there must be 
something not quite right about the deal 
sands agent thelma orloff who has sold luxury homes in los 
angeles for decades said promotional deals are nothing new but 
theyve picked up recently as the market has cooled even 
rollsroyce giveaways were tried before with varying degrees of 
success she said 
mrs orloff said one popular gimmick these days is offering 
already furnished houses 
i have sold three big houses around 6 million each with 
them furnished she said of course youve got to like the 
furniture before youll buy the house but a lot of people dont 
want the hassle they want instant house just add people 
silverman sat poolside recently during an open house lunch 
provided of course at the home actors cornel wilde and jean 
wallace built in the trousdale estates section of beverly hills 30 
years ago 
realtors dropped by to examine the house nibbling chicken and 
pineapple chunks as agent pick explained that the 4000squarefoot 
home listed at 295 million was being sold by the children 
following the actors deaths within the past year 
they traded stories of incentives offered to get sales closed a 
mercedes benz here a 10000 bonus there roundtrip tickets to 
anywhere in the world 
real estate agents with weak franchises or overextended 
businesses can be maimed or killed in such a market silverman said 
the most notorious case involved mike glickman who built an 
empire of 1800 agents in the san fernando valley during the boom 
years he declared personal and corporate bankruptcy this month at 
age 30

the supreme court on thursday generally barred 
states and energy consumers from bringing federal antitrust suits 
against energy producers accused of conspiring to fix prices 
in a separate decision the court stripped the interstate 
commerce commission of its authority to relieve shippers of their 
legal obligation to pay carriers less than their official rates 
in the price fixing case the justices said in a 54 ruling that 
only direct purchasers of energy in this case utility companies 
may file such suits 
the court ruled against kansas and missouri officials who 
accused a natural gas pipeline and five natural gas producers of 
illegal price fixing 
the attorneys general of 32 states had urged the high court to 
permit such suits 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court rejected 
arguments that states or residential customers should be permitted 
to sue because utilities lack incentive to go to court since they 
can pass on any overcharges to their customers 
utilities have an established record of diligent antitrust 
enforcement kennedy said history makes us quite hesitant to 
take from the utilities the responsibility for enforcing the 
antitrust laws 
also he continued consumers may lack the expertise and 
experience necessary for detecting improper pricing by a utilitys 
suppliers 
kansas and missouri officials said in their suit that energy 
producers conspired to inflate the price of the gas sold to 
utilities and that the alleged overcharges were passed on to 
consumers 
supporting the appeal by kansas and missouri were alaska 
arkansas california colorado connecticut florida hawaii 
illinois indiana iowa kentucky louisiana maine maryland 
massachusetts minnesota nebraska nevada new hampshire new 
jersey north carolina ohio oregon pennsylvania south dakota 
tennessee texas utah virginia washington west virginia and 
wisconsin 
the case is kansas vs utilicorp united inc 882109 
separately by a 72 vote the justices said the icc policy 
requiring carriers to file rate schedules with the commission 
violates the 103yearold interstate commerce act 
once a schedule is filed a carrier cannot charge more or less 
than what it states but the commission which regulates interstate 
trucking and has the authority to approve or disapprove tariff

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
higher in subdued trading thursday on the chicago board of trade 
trading in corn futures was thin in reaction to the abrupt 
collapse in prices late wednesday 
after wednesdays action people were relunctant to take a 
position in corn said joel karlin an analyst with research 
department inc 
concerns over a potential drawdown in corn stockpiles helped 
boost longterm corn futures 
nearby futures were pressured by weather forecasts which call 
for normal temperatures over the next six to 10 days and below 
normal precipitation 
soybeans futures were slightly higher on the possibility of 
additional export business due to the continuing port strike in 
brazil prices were also helped by a lack of farmer selling by 
south american growers karlin said 
wheat prices were boosted by expectations of increased export 
business and concerns about the quality of the soft red winter 
wheat crop 
there were reports the us agriculture department is finding 
reduced test weights in the winter crop an indication of lower 
quality and reduced yields due to excessive precipitation 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 338 cents a bushel corn was 
cent to 3 cents lower with july at 285 a bushel oats were a 
cent to 1 cent lower with july at 140 a bushel soybeans were 4

postcommunist eastern europe opened thursday in budapest 42 years 
after it was closed by communist authorities 
officials hope the fledgling budapest trading floor will boost 
marketoriented economic reforms and become the stock exchange 
center for all of eastern europe 
on its first day the exchange reported 581 million forints 
more than 900000 worth of trading in the 41 listed companies 
prime minister jozsef antall in a telegram from west germany 
where he is on an official visit said the budapest stock exchange 
as an important institution of a market economy 
richard c breeden chairman of the us securities and exchange 
commission presented the exchange with a new bell modeled after 
one used for years to open trading on the new york stock exchange 
breeden also read a letter from president bush that said in 
part free and competitive markets are an essential attribute of 
a free economy they also represent an important element of a 
democratic society the reestablishment of the budapest stock 
exchange is thus a milestone in the continuation of democratic 
developments in hungary and it should encourage strong economic 
growth for the future 
on sale to mark the opening was a special englishlanguage 
edition of toezsde kurir stock market courier that was launched 
earlier this year 
a stock exchange first opened in hungary in 1864 but was closed 
in 1948 when communists came to power after world war ii 
until the 80s it was heresy to even suggest anything of the 
sort said hungarys interim president arpad goencz alluding to 
communists description of a stock market as the ultimate symbol of 
capitalism 
even before democratic change swept eastern europe last year 
hungary tended toward reform 
the communist authorities set up a market for stateguaranteed 
bonds in 1983 and an embryonic stock market was created two years 
ago that gave hungarian financial experts training officials hope 
will make budapest the best candidate as a center for a eastern 
european exchange 
in march a key government act on the stock exchange and 
securities took effect giving the market a legal framework 
but financial experts said the stock exchange still has a long 
way to go before it establishes itself on the international market 
finance minister ferenc rabar said at the opening ceremony that 
the exchange does not in itself solve the problem of the 
liberalization of the economy he said we have much to do yet 
in that regard 
in a recent article in the economic weekly heti vilaggazdasag 
the stock exchange executive president ilona hardy said the 
exchange will need to increase the number of listed companies 
to operate well there is a need for considerably more 
securities especially publicly issued shares a working 
infrastructure welltrained stockmarket experts and a new 
type of investmentoriented attitude she said 
the situation in hungary today and the present situation of 
the securities market are not optimal conditions for the 
development of a stock market but at the same time the stock 
exchange can make a significant contribution to the development of 
the market hardy said 
the exchanges main aim is to achieve reprivatization of the 
countrys inefficient stateowned enterprises by allowing 
companies to sell shares to meet their capital needs 
at a trial exchange that met three times a week volume was low 
with 5 million forints to 20 million forints 77000 to 300000 
worth of shares trading hands 
eva farago head of the exchanges financial department said 
one factor hindering the exchange is that the hungarian currency 
cannot be converted freely into foreign currencies 
but she said the lack of convertibility is counterbalanced by 
guarantees that foreigners can repatriate their dividends in hard 
currency 
rabar said hungary wants to make the forint convertible by the 
end of 1991 or early 1992 that would mean a major devaluation of 
the hungarian currency which presently is pegged at 63 forints to 
the dollar

leading west german banks plan to pump more 
than 3 billion into the struggling soviet economy officials said 
thursday as the government in bonn seeks the kremlins goahead 
for german unity 
otto lambsdorff leader of the free democratic party and a 
former economics minister confirmed the deal in an interview with 
deutschlandfunk radio in cologne 
the credit of 5 billion west german marks or 31 billion was 
negotiated by deutsche bank and dresdner bank two of west 
germanys largest with the soviet unions foreign trade bank 
the credit aims to help the soviet transition from a centrally 
planned economy to a market economy an effort that is similar to 
reform plans in other east bloc countries 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has told the soviet people 
that a transition to a market economy is needed in order to further 
plans for radical restructuring of the soviet system 
but the soviets have balked at introducing real price reform and 
making the ruble a convertible currency a move that would make the 
country more attractive for foreign investors 
west germany has indicated its willingness to broaden economic 
cooperation with the soviet union as part of shaping future 
relations with a united germany bonn also would like to see moscow 
drop bitter objections to nato membership for the joined country 
the soviet union stands to lose one of its key economic partners 
as east germany unites with west germany 
many of the east german firms with which the soviet union traded 
are likely to go bankrupt once the two germanys merge their 
currencies on july 2 others that survive will have their products 
priced in the new expensive marks 
east germany in the past has supplied soviet industry with high 
technology including optics and computers industrial components 
and consumer goods 
the future of trade agreements already concluded between the 
soviet union and east germany is unclear but west germany has 
indicated a willingness to take over at least part of the existing 
obligations 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told his 
soviet counterpart eduard a shevardnadze in talks in muenster 
earlier this week that bonn was prepared to further develop 
relations on a full scale 
west german finance minister theo waigel is expected to inform 
the appropriations committee of west german parliament on the terms 
of the credit at a session in bonn on friday 
committee approval is required for the governmentguaranteed 
loan but it is expected to pass easily 
west germany hopes that economic assistance will make it easier 
for moscow to accept the loss of its east german ally in addition 
to membership of a united germany in the nato alliance 
like other east bloc countries attempting to undo the chaos 
created by decades of central planning the soviet union needs 
massive injection of foreign capital 
soviet borrowing has increased in the last several years as the 
country develops a greater need for credit but at the same time 
its ability to repay is dropping 
the need for credit is a sign of a critical economic 
situation the soviet union must have credit because domestic 
savings are not great enough to carry out the great restructuring 
they have in mind said klauspeter schmidt of the institute for 
world economy in kiel

a late round of buying enabled the stock market 
to post a small gain today 
analysts said traders seemed uncertain about where the market 
might get any inspiration to extend its spring rally 
while interest rates and inflationary pressures have been ebbing 
in recent weeks nothing has happened to fulfill hopes that the 
federal reserve might adopt a more stimulative credit policy 
indeed fed officials have suggested they are still inclined to 
stay with a relatively restrictive approach 
this morning the commerce department reported that the gross 
national product grew at a 19 percent annual rate after 
adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors in the first quarter 
of the year 
the figure revised upward from a previous estimate of 13 
percent was seen as confirming evidence that the economy keeps 
growing sluggishly

japan will keep its ban on rice imports despite 
signs that some japanese would welcome them because the nations 
rice farmers need special protection the agriculture minister said 
thursday 
we have opened the agricultural market but there is a line 
beyond which we cannot pass tomio yamamoto minister of 
agriculture fisheries and forestry said in a lecture at the japan 
national press club 
agriculture is the foundation of our nation in other 
countries rice doesnt account for over half of all production the 
way it does here that is a special circumstance for japan 
yamamoto said 
his comments showed the government will continue to resist 
lifting japans virtual ban on rice imports despite indications of 
growing public support for liberalizing the rice market 
a recent poll showed growing public support for opening the 
market a survey of 3000 people by japans largest newspaper the 
yomiuri shimbun indicated 71 percent favored easing rice market 
controls up from 41 percent in 1988 only 24 percent wanted to 
keep the rice market closed compared with 53 percent in 1988 the 
survey said 
the agriculture ministry buys most of the nations rice crop at 
preset prices it stockpiles or resells the staple at subsidized 
prices that are several times higher than world market prices 
limited amounts of rice are imported for production of other foods 
and alcoholic beverages 
former prime minister noboru takeshita in comments at the press 
club last week said he thought japan ought to consider how to 
dismantle the food control system that has been in place since 
world war ii given the apparent shift in public opinion 
he praised as courageous a recent shift in position by the 
komeito the secondlargest opposition party which recently 
endorsed opening japans rice market 
the united states strongly has urged tokyo to ease its ban on 
rice imports during the current uruguay round of trade talks under 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade which ends in december 
japan has refused citing a need for selfsufficiency in the 
countrys staple food 
it is only thanks to the food control system that the japanese 
can be confident of always being able to buy rice at a reasonable 
price without it there could be food panics yamamoto said 
under pressure to open its markets japan has lifted controls on 
beef and citrus products as well as on some processed foods 
measured by calories roughly half the food japanese eat is 
imported as imports have grown so has concern that serious supply 
disruptions such as war could leave people hungry 
yamamoto said that even if all its trading partners lift farm 
tariffs and quotas making their markets completely free japan 
must continue protecting the small farmers who carry on japans 
ancient craft of rice cultivation the nation also needs to 
preserve the rural environment for future generations he said 
our farmers are losing confidence in the future of farming in 
japan this is a terrible thing he said international 
competition may require that we speed up efforts to improve the 
competitiveness of our farmers but it has to be done step by 
step 
the struggle to preserve japans rice culture also is challenged 
by declining domestic consumption 
in 1978 each japanese ate an average 180 pounds of rice in 
1988 each consumed only 156 pounds consumption fell another 22 
pounds last year 
unused rice fields can be seen throughout japans countryside 
and only 13 percent of japans rice farmers make a fulltime living 
from the crop

the national association of securities dealers 
inc says it will introduce its own rule to protect corporate 
stockholders from unequal voting rights if a federal version 
remains struck down by the courts 
last week a federal appeals court in washington unanimously held 
that the securities and exchange commission exceeded its authority 
in prohibiting publicly traded corporations from weakening the 
voting power of those who already own stock in the company 
the sec which oversees the stock and bond markets as well as 
the exchanges that trade in them has yet to say if it will appeal 
the decision by a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of 
appeals for the district of columbia 
but joseph hardiman president of the nasd said if the ruling 
is upheld we will propose a lookalike rule 
the nasd is a washingtonbased selfregulating organization 
that oversees the socalled overthecounter stock market it 
regulates stocks that are usually not traded on an exchange and 
provides an automated stock price quotation system to monitor such 
securities 
sec rule 19c4 adopted in july 1988 prohibited publicly traded 
corporations from weakening the voting power of those who own 
existing stock by issuing new classes of stock with superior or 
supervoting rights 
the sec is not allowed to interfere in how a company runs itself 
a matter left to state jurisdiction but the rule allowed it to 
bar an offending companys stock from being listed on the stock 
exchanges of the nasd quote system which the sec does oversee 
nevertheless the appeals court agreed with the business 
roundtable an association of top corporations that the rule 
crossed the line into corporate rather than exchange governance 
i think we clearly have the authority as a market operator and 
regulator to adopt those rules for our markets and so does the new 
york stock exchange and the philadelphia stock exchange and the 
american stock exchange said hardiman 
he insisted that such a rule would not be a one share one 
vote rule because it would not bar companies new to the public 
market from creating unequal shareholders rights only preventing 
them from stripping existing shares of their voting powers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
but he added that if other exchanges dont follow the nasds 
lead and permit unequal voting rights then the plan could be in 
trouble 
if the other markets dont go along and if they start to use 
shareholders voting rights differentials as a competitive tool 
then all bets are off he said

east and west german lawmakers 
overwhelmingly approved a treaty to merge their economies thursday 
removing one of the last remaining obstacles to de facto 
unification 
lawmakers in both countries also passed resolutions declaring 
that a united germany would guarantee polands western border 
the powerful west german bundestag the lower house of 
parliament late thursday voted 44560 with one abstention to pass 
the economic merger treaty after a sometimes heated debate lasting 
nearly 15 hours 
final approval of the historic pact outlining the monetary 
economic and social unification of the two germanys was expected 
friday when the west german parliaments upper house the 
bundesrat takes up the issue 
a loud round of applause greeted the announcement of the treaty 
vote in the bundestag which was seen as a major victory for west 
german chancellor helmut kohl who has pushed for rapid unification 
kohl appealed to bundestag members to pass the treaty saying he 
was convinced that each one of us will one day be judged by 
whether he or she faintheartedly backed away or gave full support 
on this momentous occasion 
earlier thursday the east german parliament or volkskammer 
approved the treaty ending four decades of failed socialism 
the treaty to take effect july 2 basically unifies the two 
german states however details of full political unification 
particularly the future military alliance of a united germany 
remain to be worked out by the two germanys together with the 
victorious world war ii allies the united states the soviet 
union britain and france 
the bundestag also voted 48715 with three abstentions to 
approve a resolution recognizing the oderneisse rivers as polands 
uncontested western border the east german parliament earlier in 
the day passed a similar resolution declaring a united germany 
would not seek to reclaim former german territories lost to poland 
after world war ii 
the issue had become one of the most emotional as the two 
germanys move rapidly toward unification 
poles had feared a united germany might try to reclaim the 
former german lands representing about onethird of polands 
present territory ultraconservative west germans opposed any 
moves to abandon german claims to the former territories 
the two german parliaments met simultaneously in their 
respective capitals thursday to take final action on the economic 
merger treaty the two governments signed the treaty may 18 but 
approval by both parliaments was necessary 
in east berlin as the volkskammer debated the treaty about 100 
people demonstrated against the measure outside the parliament 
building 
after the 30282 vote in favor of the treaty was announced east 
german lawmakers rose in a standing ovation there was one 
abstention 
the pds the successor party of the old east german communists 
bundnis 90 which led last falls revolution and the greens 
opposed the treaty they said they supported german unity but not 
under existing conditions 
as debate began in bonn thursday morning kohl urged lawmakers 
to pass both the treaty and the polish border resolution 
after over 40 years of painful separation the hopes of the 
people of germany for the unity and freedom of all germans are 
about to be fulfilled kohl said 
kohl urged unanimous approval of the economic merger 
the treaty shows the way to german unity and whoever doesnt 
follow this road sign doesnt want unity he said 
for the people in germany this will make unity come true in 
vital areas of their daily existence he said whoever rejects 
the treaty also rejects our compatriots in the german democratic 
republic 
under the treaty the powerful west german mark becomes the 
currency of both countries on july 2 and east germany moves from 
socialism to capitalism 
east german wages salaries and pensions will be converted to 
west german marks at a 11 exchange rate the exchange rate for 
savings deposits varies with age with a maximum of 3600 at the 
11 rate for those over 60 
west germanys main opposition party the leftleaning social 
democrats criticized the treaty saying it fails to adequately 
protect east germans who face economic hardship in the transition 
from socialism to a free market 
but their chairman hansjochen vogel told the bundestag a 
majority would approve the treaty failure to do so would be too 
much of a shock to east german expectations and could lead to 
uncontrollable developments he said 
the leftist greens party argued against passage saying the 
treaty would not bring the two germanys closer together but would 
create newer and deeper forms of division by making east germany a 
dependent institution 
some experts predict up to 2 million east germans could lose 
their jobs as outmoded governmentowned factories and businesses 
try to compete more than a third of the enterprises are expected 
to close and there are fears of social unrest 
the economic merger treaty comes after months of work following 
the collapse late last year of east germanys communist government 
and the opening of the berlin wall east germany elected a 
noncommunist government in march 
kohl acknowledge recognition of polands current western border 
was painful for many germans 
nonetheless he said either we affirm the present boundary 
or we lose the chance of german unity
