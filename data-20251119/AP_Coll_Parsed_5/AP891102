tugboats successfully dragged a 475foot 
yugoslavian freighter from a sandy shoal off the florida keys late 
thursday after the ships fuel oil was pumped off to a barge to 
lighten the vessel the coast guard said 
the mavro vetranic which ran aground on the shoal containing 
fragile coral last monday was refloated at 904 pm est with 
the assistance of tugs we dont know how many said coast guard 
spokesman steve sapp 
theyre moving it to safe anchorage in deeper water what 
theyre going to do is perform a survey inside the ship to see how 
much damage was done sapp said 
there was no leaking or pollution of any kind from the 
freighter he added 
sapp said the freighter was pulled free shortly after crews 
completed the twoday operation to unload the ships fuel as the 
tide was coming in 
the hull was not damaged when the ship ran aground early monday 
in the dry tortugas about 60 miles west of key west but state 
officials estimate the ship caused tens of millions of dollars 
damage by carving a 500foot swath through coral patches 
the state expected to file suit for reef damage friday in monroe 
circuit court

from ceasefire talks with the rightist government to protest the 
bombing of a union hall that killed 10 people 
thousands of people many chanting for the death of the leader 
of president alfredo cristianis governing party marched through 
downtown in a funeral procession for six of the 10 victims of the 
attack 
because the color of blood is never forgotten our slain 
companions will be avenged shouted the unionists and students 
carrying wreaths and banners denouncing cristianis government 
death to daubuisson shouted the marchers referring to 
roberto daubuisson founder and honorary president of cristianis 
republican nationalist alliance human rights advocates consider 
daubuisson the mastermind of rightist death squads that in the 
early 1980s killed thousands of suspected leftists 
leftist groups blame the administration and the military for the 
bombing tuesday military spokesmen have rejected the leftists 
accusation and promised to investigate and punish those 
responsible no one claimed responsibility 
soldiers and police stayed well away during most of the march 
the only incident occurred when a soldier tossed a teargas grenade 
at the rear of a march leaving a few dozen demonstrators crying 
and coughing 
in a radio broadcast the farabundo marti national liberation 
front guerrillas said they will not take part in the next round of 
negotiations until the government offers better guarantees for the 
survival of leftist organizations 
representatives of the two sides in the decadeold civil war 
were scheduled to hold their third meeting this year on nov 2021 
in caracas venezuela 
earlier meetings in mexico city and san jose costa rica had 
deadlocked but the two sides had agreed to continue meeting 
monthly until a ceasefire was negotiated 
there was no immediate government reaction to the guerrilla 
statement government offices were closed for the day of the dead 
holiday and an employee at the home of the government press 
secretary said he was out of town 
in the broadcast over private radio station ysu the guerrillas 
said they had information the bomb attack tuesday that killed 10 
people and wounded 29 was planned and carried out by the military 
in retaliation for a guerrilla attack monday on the defense 
ministry 
the statement said gen rene ponce military chief of staff 
approved attacks which were known and authorized by president 
cristiani and were executed by col francisco elena fuentes 
commander of the shady 1st infantry brigade squadron 
the guerrillas gave no details to back up their assertion 
the rebels said they were withdrawing from the talks in order 
not to legitimize the governments responsibility for the 
massacre 
the downtown hall belonging to the national federation of 
salvadoran workers known by its spanish initials as fenastras was 
partially destroyed by the blast 
another bomb earlier tuesday injured four people at the office 
of madres an organization of relatives of political prisoners 
two americans were slightly injured in the blasts 
on wednesday rebels fired two antitank weapons at the 
headquarters of the 1st brigade killing one civilian and wounding 
another 
more than 70000 people mostly civilians have been slain in 
the civil war 
president bush on thursday condemned recent violence from 
extremists from both the left and the right but said cristianis 
government continues in the democratic path of former 
salvadoran president jose napolean duarte 
bush spoke at a ceremony honoring duarte at walter reed medical 
center in washington where the former salvadoran leader is 
hospitalized with terminal cancer 
in march voters elected cristiani over the candidate of the 
thengoverning christian democratic party cristiani replaced 
duarte who by law could not run for reelection

only a few blocks separate the 
confederate banner flapping atop alabamas capitol from a new 
memorial honoring 40 people who died fighting for civil rights 
cool water flows down the black slabs that form the back wall of 
the monument which will be dedicated sunday as the nations first 
memorial to those killed in americas struggle for racial equality 
in front of the monuments wall a round granite table is etched 
with a timeline of the civil rights era 195468 and the names 
of those 40 who lost their lives during it water flowing out from 
the center of the table covers the words 
a few of the names are recognizable martin luther king jr and 
medgar evers for example as well as james chaney andrew goodman 
and michael schwerner the three who were murdered during the 
freedom summer of 1964 and whose story was depicted in the film 
mississippi burning 
others are not so well known who was vernon dahmer or jimmie 
lee jackson while kings 1968 assassination sent a tidal wave of 
emotion across the national landscape their deaths caused barely a 
ripple 
the 700000 monument was designed by maya lin who created the 
vietnam veterans memorial in washington dc it sits in front of 
the southern poverty law center a civil rights law firm founded in 
1971 by attorney morris dees 
the centers previous office burned down in 1983 two ku klux 
klansmen and a sympathizer were convicted for setting the fire the 
new facility a glassandstone structure of modern design and 
heavy security rose from those ashes 
dees came up with the idea for a memorial after addressing an 
naacp meeting in 1987 and realizing its younger members were 
unaware even of people like evers the head of the mississippi 
naacp who was shot on june 12 1963 
it really struck me that these young people were active in a 
black civil rights organization and didnt know who these people 
were said dees 
for ellie dahmer one of 600 relatives of the dead who will 
attend the dedication the memorial is one of the most beautiful 
things thats been done for the civil rights workers her 
husband vernon died of burns on jan 10 1966 after klansmen 
firebombed their home in hattiesburg miss 
dahmer a prominent black businessman had said he would pay the 
poll taxes for poor blacks who otherwise could not vote three 
klansmen were convicted of murder in the bombing 
former marion police chief to harris has a problem with one 
activist being honored jimmie lee jackson who was shot during a 
civil rights march that turned violent in marion on feb 26 1965 
jimmie lee saw a trooper strike his mother and he lunged for 
the man without thinking according to a publication put out by 
the law center to tell the stories of the honored 40 a trooper 
clubbed him across the face and slammed him into a cigarette 
machine as jimmie lee was forced against the machine another 
trooper shot him in the stomach 
harris who helped get jackson to a hospital after the shooting 
remembered it differently in an interview last week he hit a 
trooper in the head with a bottle before he was shot he brought it 
on himself 
montgomery is known as the cradle of the confederacy as well as 
the birthplace of the civil rights movement 
a visitor to the monument standing on a hillside near dexter 
avenue downtowns main steet can see the steeple of kings first 
church a little more than a block away just two blocks away are 
the first white house of the confederacy and the capitol where 
jefferson davis took the oath of office as the first president of 
the confederacy 
organizers have said up to 10000 people could attend the 
dedication including georgias first black state lawmaker julian 
bond and rosa parks who instigated the montgomery bus boycott of 
195556 by refusing to give up her seat to a white man 
the rev jesse jackson atlanta mayor andrew young and coretta 
scott king could not attend because of prior commitments spokesmen 
said although about 50 king relatives will be on hand gov guy 
hunt who has resisted attempts to take down the rebel flag over 
the capitol also cited a scheduling conflict 
in recent years litigation brought by the law center has helped 
bankrupt the ku klux klan in alabama 
david wayne holland of lawrenceville ga who recently resigned 
as grand dragon of the southern white knights of the kkk went to 
federal court seeking a permit to stage a demonstration during the 
dedication 
however us district judge robert varner ruled thursday that 
city officials concerns over public safety were justified in 
denying the klan permission to protest varner cited hollands 
speeches and his involvement in a violent 1987 confrontation in 
forsyth county ga as reasons to keep him away

leland holland survived his hostage ordeal and 
now battles prostate cancer thomas schaefer helps people cope with 
stress bruce laingen keeps a yellow ribbon on his flag to remember 
other us hostages 
kevin hermening treasures walks in the free fresh air of the 
forest with the appreciation of one who was held for 444 days by an 
iranian mob 10 years ago 
whether we like it or not well always be exhostages it 
drives me in everything i do said hermening 30 an exmarine 
and the youngest hostage 
i feel ive been given a second chance said hermening who 
lives in suburban milwaukee you can either go into a shell and 
have it eat at your insides or you can grow you have to get on 
with life 
it was sunday morning nov 4 1979 when an iranian mob broke 
international law and shamed a superpower by seizing the us 
embassy fiftytwo americans were held until jan 20 1981 the day 
ronald reagan took over jimmy carters foiled presidency 
the militants demanded the return of their hated shah who had 
entered a us hospital for cancer treatment 13 days before the 
takeover when that failed they dangled their captors as pawns to 
fuel their revolution in the process iran became an outcast in 
the world community 
the hostages became metaphors of american humiliation and pain 
but also were a unifying force the joy of their release rekindled 
patriotism and helped a nation heal the leftover wounds of vietnam 
their ordeal is seared into the american psyche along with 
images of a glowering ayatollah eight soldiers who died in a 
desert in hopes of freeing them billboards saying merci 
beaucoup to canadians who helped six americans escape and yellow 
ribbons that fluttered the message the entire country was hostage 
when we returned that burden of having been held hostage 
politically was lifted from the countrys shoulders said 
laingen the embassys charge daffaires who now directs the 
national commission on public service a private agency working to 
attract quality people to the government 
we were 52 americans in distress the whole country rallied 
around we saw a national catharsis he said 
laingen 68 sets out his american flag beribboned in yellow to 
remember the eight american hostages held by iranianbacked 
radicals in lebanon one of whom has been held for over four years 
i think most of us have put the hurt the travail of our 
experience behind us laingen said the most telling reminder 
is that terrorism has not gone away hostagetaking has not gone 
away 
the hostages endured mock executions beatings solitary 
confinement and wormy food over 14 months 
holland a retired army colonel says some scars still exist 
from being imprisoned alone in a buginfested dungeon 
heaven help a roach if i see one i will get a shotgun to kill 
a fly i hate bugs said holland 62 who was handcuffed 
blindfolded and smacked with a rifle butt during captivity 
he got some measure of revenge by showing his backside to tv 
cameras set up by his captors to track hostages when they went to 
the bathroom 
holland now living in the washington dc area was told 
three years ago he has prostate cancer 
i can sit around and worry myself to death or i can take 
advantage of however much time i have left on earth i dont intend 
to be miserable because of what happened to me holland said 
explaining why hes not bitter toward his captors he said if 
nothing else i want to show im tougher than they are 
the hostage crisis boiled down to a quarrel between two 
countries that still share a deep mutual distrust it was resolved 
when the united states pledged not to interfere in irans internal 
affairs and the two countries established a framework for settling 
billions of dollars in claims against each other 
the united states still holds iranian assets valued at billions 
of dollars diplomatic relations are severed 
the freed americans were treated like prisoners of a political 
war fought with nerves rather than bullets 
none of us thinks of ourselves as heroes we think of 
ourselves as people who survived said barry rosen a former 
press attache who is now assistant to the president at brooklyn 
college 
thomas schaefer a retired air force colonel rationalized his 
captivity as a learning experience he opened an agency devoted to 
helping people handle stress and adversity 
i dont look at it as losing 444 days of my life i gained 
many things such as finding out strengths i never knew i had until 
i was presented with this challenge said schaefer 60 now 
living in sun city west ariz 
some of the 52 hostages are still in the diplomatic service and 
some have switched careers or retired one william keough died in 
1985 
robert blucher an oil specialist who arrived in iran one week 
before the takeover doesnt register to vote so he wont be 
confined in a room if hes called to jury duty 
im not prepared to do jury duty i dont like to be in the 
control of others said blucher 63 of san antonio 
joseph subic a former army sergeant works in enforcement for 
the state agriculture department in southern florida he was the 
only serviceman not decorated upon his release other hostages say 
he cooperated with his captors by giving background information on 
comrades but he denies helping the enemy 
i did the best i could i have nothing to look back on and say 
im sorry for i sleep well at night i have nothing to hide 
said subic 33 
iran is over with

doctors may be able to prevent suicides by 
recognizing when people are in the grips of terrifying panic 
attacks and helping them seek treatment researchers report today 
the research published in the new england journal of medicine 
found that people who suffer recurring panic attacks are 18 times 
more likely than other people to try to kill themselves 
during panic attacks people are gripped by sudden 
unpredictable waves of intense apprehension or fear they may 
suffer a variety of distressing symptoms including difficulty 
breathing palpitations chest pain choking dizziness faintness 
trembling and hot and cold flashes 
victims often believe they are suffering heart attacks or dying 
when they go to emergency rooms however they are sometimes told 
nothing is wrong with them 
in an editorial accompanying the study dr peter reich of the 
massachusetts institute of technology called the findings quite 
remarkable he said they deserve widespread attention because 
they may provide general physicians with new opportunities to 
prevent suicide by recognizing and treating panic disorder 
an estimated 15 percent of americans or more than 3 million 
people have panic disorder recurring bouts of intense fear that 
strike for no apparent reason up to 9 million people have 
occasional panic attacks 
the study directed by dr myrna m weissman found that 20 
percent of people with panic disorder had attempted suicide as had 
12 percent of those with occasional panic attacks 
the finding points to a potentially serious complication of a 
common disorder that has been relatively neglected commented dr 
kerrin white of mclean hospital in suburban boston 
the researchers said that people plagued by panic attacks may 
believe they are going crazy and turn to alcohol become afraid to 
leave their homes or grow depressed 
they said their work should encourage emergency room doctors and 
other physicians who often see people during panic attacks to offer 
treatment for their disorder 
we hope this alerts the nonpsychiatric physician to the 
potential mortality and morbidity of panic disorder said 
weissman a psychiatric epidemiologist at columbia university if 
a patient comes into the cardiac clinic and has panic disorder and 
heart attack is ruled out we would like the physician to realize 
that the patient should be evaluated for panic disorder 
just why people with panic attacks are unusually prone to 
suicide is unclear some believe that depression may play a role 
although it does not entirely explain the increased risk 
people who have panic attacks for many years become 
demoralized said dr gerald l klerman of cornell medical 
school a coauthor of the study they stay at home and withdraw 
socially and become depressed we know that depressive feelings are 
associated with suicide 
panic attacks can be controlled with medical treatment and 
behavioral therapy however dr brian doyle of georgetown 
university said that some people simply try to live with their 
episodes of terror 
many patients with panic disorder are fine upstanding people 
who do not want to be considered flaky he said so they tend 
to white knuckle through their panic attacks many times they work 
very hard to control the symptoms but internally they are in a 
great deal of distress 
the underlying cause of panic disorder is not known however 
the problem runs in families and experts believe genetic factors 
may be involved 
in the study researchers surveyed a random sample of 18011 
people in st louis baltimore los angeles durham nc and new 
haven conn 
in addition to the 18 times greater chance of a suicide attempt 
by people who suffer recurring panic attacks the study found that 
such people also were twice as likely as those with other mental 
disorders to attempt suicide the risk grows as the number of panic 
attacks increase it is also higher for those who have their first 
attacks at early ages

nicaraguan president daniel ortega in an 
article published in the new york times pledged to hold free and 
democratic elections next year and defended his decision to end a 
ceasefire with the contra rebels 
ortega also lashed out at president bush for delivering a 
torrent of personal invective against the central american 
leader during a meeting of hemispheric leaders in costa rica last 
week 
he accused me of spoiling the garden party in costa rica 
ortega said in the oped piece published in thursdays editions 
well life in my country is no garden party eight years of 
war financed and directed by the reagan and bush adminstrations 
have seen to that 
ortega defended his move to end the ceasefire which he 
announced last week in at the democracy celebration in san jose 
costa rica provoking outrage from bush and other latin american 
leaders 
the only way to peace in nicaragua is to disband the 
ussupported rebels ortega wrote 
we do not consider it an acceptable ceasefire when we cease 
and the contras fire he said for peace to be achieved the 
war itself must be stopped there is no other way to end the war 
than to start immediately the demobilization of the contras 
a truly big man would have no difficulty making the right 
choice he wrote in an apparent reference to bushs 
characterization of him as a little man 
ortega said halting the ceasefire was necessary because the 
rebels aim through repeated violations was to subvert the 
electoral process in nicaragua which has elections scheduled for 
feb 25 
during october contra units newly supplied and infiltrated 
from honduras closed more than 50 voter registration centers 
preventing thousands of citizens from registering to vote ortega 
said they targeted for assassination known sandinista supporters 
prominent community leaders party activists and candidates for 
municipal offices and slit their throats 
he cited other attacks including one in which 19 reservists 
were killed in an oct 21 ambush on their way to register to vote 
why the upswing in contra violence the success of our 
electoral process has made them desperate they fear that free 
elections duly recognized by the international community will end 
their flickering hopes of continuing the way ortega said 
he also made a solemn pledge that his country would 
celebrate free fair and democratic elections

a nation that nervously watched the california 
earthquake on television and then sent more than 7 million in aid 
received a scare and a shaking from an equally powerful tremor 
today 
no casualties or major damage were reported in todays quake 
which measured an estimated 71 on the richter scale and whose 
impact was blunted by its epicenters distance from japans pacific 
coast about 80 miles 
nevertheless 6165 people from six coastal towns and villages 
were evacuated to town halls and school gymnasiums for fear of 
tsunami or waves generated by the quake said toshihara kon a 
fire department official in iwate prefecture about 300 miles 
northeast of tokyo 
the evacuation order was lifted 3 hours after the quake hit at 
326 am kon said shortly after that all tsunami warnings were 
lifted the central meteorological agency reported 
as felt in northern honshu japans main island the quake was 
strong enough to shake buildings and topple unstable objects 
waves of up to two feet were reported in some areas and about 
400 boats mostly fishing craft put out to sea from hachinohe to 
avoid being caught in the harbor by tsunami they later returned 
kon said a small landslide briefly blocked traffic on a local 
road but fallen dirt and rocks were cleared and traffic soon 
returned to normal 
officials briefly closed the main expressway through the 
affected region for inspection and overnight trains were stopped so 
rails could be inspected 
japans meteorological agency estimated the quakes magnitude at 
71 on the richter scale nearly the same as that of the quake that 
devastated much of the san francisco bay area on oct 17 
the us geological survey in colorado estimated the japanese 
quakes magnitude at 73 don finley a spokesman for the survey 
said it was the strongest in the region since a 77 quake on march 
9 1931 
toshio akiyama head of the japanese agencys earthquake and 
tsunami observation division said that although distance weakened 
the effect of todays quake authorities were concerned because a 
series of quakes have occurred in the area in recent months 
on sunday a quake registering 65 and centered about 95 miles 
off the coast hit the area without causing casualties or damage 
like california japan sits atop a major fault and is frequently 
shaken by earthquakes although few cause casualties fears of a 
major temblor prompt regular national disasterprevention drills 
and newer buildings are designed to withstand quakes of up to 8 on 
the richter scale 
many japanese had immediate word of the san francisco quake as 
they tuned in for a satellite telecast of the world series 
the foreign ministry said it knew of at least 72 million in 
government and private contributions from japan for san francisco 
quake victims 
after that quake japanese experts rushed to the area hoping to 
learn why some buildings collapsed and others stood 
akiyama said japan had a second quake today at 457 am in 
tottori prefecture about 300 miles southwest of tokyo he said 
there were no casualties or damage reported from that 57magnitude 
quake and todays two temblors were not related 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in 
populated areas and a quake of 7 is capable of widespread heavy 
damage

the contra guerrillas fighting the sandinista 
government in nicaragua have said it again and again they dont 
recognize the central american peace accords and they wont accept 
demobilization 
that stubborn stand now has become a stumbling block to peace in 
the region and to democratic elections in nicaragua leading to 
president daniel ortegas announcement wednesday that he was 
suspending a 19month truce and resuming the war 
the problem here is not the ceasefire the problem here is 
the demobilization said ortega 
he said he was ending the unilateral ceasefire which began in 
march 1988 because of increasing attacks by the contras in 
defiance of agreements signed by five central american presidents 
in tela honduras on aug 7 
the presidents called for voluntary demobilization repatriation 
or resettlement of contra fighters most of them based at camps in 
honduras in exchange ortega agreed to democratize the electoral 
process and hold elections on feb 25 with international observers 
battlehardened contra troop commanders who had taken over 
leadership of the movement quickly said the peace process would not 
work without their participation and vowed to move back into 
nicaragua with their men 
we will say thank you and goodbye to honduras said 
commander dima a member of the contra general staff in an 
interview at one of the camps on aug 25 
us officials said they would prefer that the contras remain in 
honduras to guarantee the fairness of the feb 25 vote and said 
they feared the small groups of contras would be wiped out by the 
vastly larger sandinista army 
but the angry commanders feeling betrayed both by the united 
states and by other nations in the region werent listening 
they also expressed contempt for contra office soldiers who 
spent the long years of war in miami or washington instead of the 
jungle they expressed bitterness about us support which one 
compared to a balky cigarette lighter that works when it wants 
to 
but they also felt a sense of freedom from restraints imposed by 
us policy as well as the taint of being us mercenaries 
contra army commander israel galeano in a speech at the 
contras main camp at yamales in honduras outlined a classic 
guerrilla strategy for the future 
if we fight for the people we have to gain their support he 
said we are the peasants of nicaragua 
he said that neither the sandinistas nor the rest of the world 
had ever acknowledged that the contras were real people poor 
people with real grievances against the sandinista government 
the bulk of the contra army was in fact made up of sharecroppers 
and small farmers who resented sandinista land reform and attempts 
to collectivize agriculture or force farmers to sell to the state 
at fixed prices 
we know we have made mistakes said defense minister 
humberto ortega daniel ortegas brother during a september 
interview in mexico city ortega said he thought contras 
infiltrating from honduras would try to move into 
sandinistacontrolled zones 
well attack them so that we understand each other he said 
when the aug 7 agreements were announced there were about 
12000 contra fighters in honduras many of them accompanied by 
their families 
some were already looking for ways to fade out of the war 
moving to canada finding work in honduras or simply returning 
quietly to their homes in nicaragua 
the numbers of those actually returning to nicaragua as members 
of fighting units is unclear 
enrique bermudez the only outside contra commander who 
retained respect among the fighters said wednesday that 6000 had 
returned daniel ortega said 1100 had returned in the last three 
weeks us sources put total contra forces in nicaragua at 4000 
the united states has been providing nonlethal aid to the 
contras since military aid was suspended in february 1988 the 
socalled humanitarian aid includes boots tents and uniforms 
that contras can use in nicaragua 
but no weapons or ammunition were received and us sources in 
washington said they refused pleas to provide food in smaller 
packages that would be easier to pack into the jungle 
nevertheless the contras said they would fight on seizing 
weapons and ammunition where they could we started with 22s and 
shotguns said dima 
that fierce determination foolish or not finally led 
nicaraguas sandinistas to the realization that the dec 5 deadline 
for demobilization would not be met 
the sandinistas vowed to proceed with elections no matter what 
the contras did but added that renewed us military aid might be 
cause for cancellation 
both sandinistas and contras on wednesday announced escalating 
clashes in the jungles and mountains of northern and eastern 
nicaragua where the contra troops were fighting for survival 
as the fighting flared bermudez said in a telephone interview 
that the contras had not received even a single cartridge from 
the united states and admitted that prospects for renewed military 
aid were grim 
faced with this reality we cant do anything except save our 
own lives and defend ourselves as best we can he said

the recent string of accidents aboard navy 
vessels may just be due to bad luck rather than a lack of training 
or poor equipment congressional military experts say 
but one civilian specialist whos studied hazards aboard 
aircraft carriers warns that budget cuts in navy training could 
lead to more accidents 
congress is always trying to cut training budgets but if a 
pilot cant practice flying those on the deck dont get trained 
either its a prescription for an accident said karlene 
roberts an industrial psychologist participating in a fiveyear 
study of nimitzclass aircraft carriers and hazardous industrial 
systems 
overall ms roberts said the navys safety record is 
excellent 
from sundays jet crash aboard the aircraft carrier uss 
lexington that claimed five lives to wednesdays fire aboard the 
oiler uss monongahela the week has brought a series of accidents 
that has left navy brass shaking their heads 
operating at sea is an arduous life and the lesson is that 
even at peace time there are dangers said rear adm brent baker 
the head of the navys information division 
thats no consolation to the families who have lost sons or 
daughters but those who have been around the navy a long time 
realize thats why we train so hard and emphasize safety you 
cant prepare for war at the pier said baker 
the admiral called the string of accidents frustrating its a 
real streak of bad luck 
sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on the 
senate armed services committee who served as undersecretary and 
secretary of the navy for five years called the incidents an 
extraordinary grouping of unrelated accidents 
unquestionably we have the finest navy in the world we have 
the best equipment the best training that money can buy warner 
told reporters 
warner called charges that navy personnel were too young for 
their duties nonsense the senator said that when he served in 
the navy during world war ii many of the personnel were 17 years 
old and some could not read or write 
ms roberts a professor of business at the university of 
california at berkeley said that while the sailors are young 
averaging usually 20 years of age they are trained for specific 
jobs through a repetitive system that demands attention to safety 
and accountability 
the navy released figures saying that since the beginning of 
this year there have been 101 operation and training related 
fatalities throughout the service 
however included in this number are the 47 fatalities that 
resulted from the explosion on board the uss iowa excluding those 
there have been 54 fatalities this year the navy said 
the navy counted 64 operation and training related fatalities in 
1984 61 in 1985 56 in 1986 72 in 1987 and 63 in 1988 
rep charles bennett dfla chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical 
materials said these tragic these sad events are not in 
substance very much connected 
bennett said the incidents of the past week could be viewed as a 
product of bad luck but that doesnt mean we cant use them to 
prepare for the future 
in the latest incident the navy reported that nine sailors 
suffered smoke inhalation and four of those were treated for burns 
following an early morning fire in a boiler aboard the uss 
monongahela some 500 miles west of gibraltar 
the others include 
three sailors and a reported 4 million worth of nonnuclear 
missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier uss 
eisenhower near cape hatteras nc on tuesday with one sailor 
still missing and presumed dead 
a sailor aboard the aircraft carrier uss carl vinson fell into 
the pacific about 620 miles north of wake island late monday and 
was presumed lost 
a fa18 pilot dropped a 500pound bomb on the guided missile 
cruiser uss reeves in the indian ocean also on monday causing 
minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a fivefoot hole in the 
ships bow 
in the weeks most deadly event a jet pilot making his first 
landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the uss lexington in 
the gulf of mexico on sunday killing him and four others on the 
deck of the huge ship

the managing editor of the bristol bay 
news glued his resignation notice to more than 1000 copies of the 
weekly newspaper then went to work for the papers competitor 
david mcelroy said he resigned after one month on the job 
because his former boss publisher john lindauer is planning to 
run for governor and gave him no control over the newspaper 
its really unethical for a journalistic operation to be 
controlled by a politician mcelroy said wednesday hes more 
or less stated that he intends to control political news i told 
him thats unethical and i wouldnt be a part of that 
lindauer a former republican state legislator said from 
anchorage that he had not yet decided whether to run for governor 
in 1990 he said he resigned wednesday as president and chief 
executive officer of his company lindauer newspapers and radio to 
pursue other interests including politics 
he denied that his politics had anything to do with mcelroys 
resignation 
he only worked for us for about 30 days i was gone almost all 
that time in california lindauer said let me put it this way 
it was bizarre behavior under any circumstance 
mcelroy 37 joined the bristol baytimes as a reporter less than 
a week after his 3by5 resignation notice was glued to copies of 
the oct 20 edition of the bay news mcelroy said he pasted the 
notice on the paper to underscore his lack of authority

in currency dealings the dollar started higher following a 
similar upswing on overseas markets overnight 
market players were afraid of the bank of japans 
intervention and started selling the currency in early trading 
which pushed down the dollar a bit temporarily but the dollar rose 
back as investment trust companies bought it back said a trader 
with mitsubishi bank 
japans central bank sold dollars to support the yen but the 
amount of its intervention was unclear the bank of japan does not 
comment on its monetary actions 
speaking anonymously the mitsubishi bank trader said japanese 
investors are buying the dollar because they think us interest 
rates will not fall soon even though us economic growth has 
slowed 
even if us interest rates fall they will still be much 
higher than japanese rates and more profitable the trader said 
higher interest rates tend to support the price of a countrys

as a wave of antiamericanism sweeps iran 
the countrys supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei called on 
citizens to wage perpetual struggle against the united states 
khamenei addressed hundreds of students wednesday the same day 
parliament passed a law giving the government powers to arrest 
americans anywhere and put them on trial if they seek to harm 
iranians or the islamic republic 
the move came three days before expected mass antiamerican 
demonstrations to mark saturdays 10th anniversary of the seizure 
of the us embassy 
militants stormed the sprawling embassy complex nov 4 1979 and 
held 52 diplomats and other embassy personnel hostage for 444 days 
the dismay and shame resulting from this humiliation will 
always remain on the face of the oppressor ringleaders of the 
united states said khamenei a former president and successor to 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
irans staterun television network broadcast khameneis 
address it showed students punching the air with their fists and 
chanting death to america and khamenei is our leader we 
obey your orders khamenei 
western and third world diplomats believe antiamerican feeling 
is being whipped up by radicals to undermine reported efforts by 
president hashemi rafsanjani leader of irans socalled 
pragmatists to improve relations with the west and end the 
countrys isolation 
the new law was enacted in response to the us justice 
departments action earlier this year authorizing the fbi to arrest 
people wanted by us courts anywhere in the world without seeking 
permission of the countries where they are located and bring them 
to trial in the united states 
the us action did not specify iran but the islamic republic 
is one of several states washington considers to support and 
encourage terrorism including the kidnapping of americans and 
other westerners in lebanon assassinations and hijackings 
iranian radicals saw the justice departments action as aimed at 
the islamic republic and an opportunity to exploit antius 
sentiment to counter rafsanjanis policies diplomats said 
us citizens and their agents and countries which 
collaborate with the united states in kidnapping or endangering 
iranian citizens or the interests of the islamic republic will be 
tried by iranian courts according to islamic justice the new law 
declares 
hundreds of students packed the covered lawn in the grounds of 
khameneis official residence in downtown tehran on wednesday 
among them were representatives of some of the main groups that 
have called for a massive protest outside the former embassy 
saturday 
these include the students following the imams line the 
group that stormed the embassy the association of militant clergy 
and students of the intelligence ministry college 
a leading cleric ayatollah ahmad jannati declared as long 
as the islamic revolution exists us hostility will not cease as 
long as our enemy is america the struggle against it tops all our 
efforts

major fiscal legislation is being held up on 
capitol hill by the partisan wrestling over president bushs call 
for a cut in the capital gains tax 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on wednesday reiterated 
the administrations position with congressional republicans in 
strong support that the gop was willing to live with the 16 
billion in automatic spending cuts which were ordered last month 
under the grammrudman law 
the cuts half from defense and half from domestic programs 
were mandated because congress and bush have failed to agree on 
alternative ways of reducing the federal deficit 
were prepared to go that route if thats what it takes to get 
some leverage said house minority leader bob michel rill 
but democrats said they felt politically confident if 
republicans wanted to hold education grants agriculture subsidies 
national defense and a host of other popular programs hostage to a 
capital gains tax cut 
republicans claim the tax cut which bush promised in his 
campaign would be a boon to the economy democrats say its a 
giveaway to the rich 
thats not a bad battleground for me ill take it said 
rep william h gray iii dpa the house majority whip if 
republicans want to cut programs for average americans to provide 
tax breaks for donald trump ill be glad to debate that from 
the cornfields of iowa to the bayous of louisiana 
the house has passed a plan to cut the tax rate on capital 
gains but it has been blocked in the senate by a parliamentary 
move led by majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
the deadlock is holding up such matters as revising or repealing 
the medicare catastrophic illness plan and a muchneeded bill to 
raise the governments debt limit 
if the treasury isnt given new borrowing authority next week 
it could be forced to default and bring major damage to the 
governments world financial position

an awesome aftershock to the 
devastating oct 17 earthquake jolted northern california late 
wednesday panicking people from san francisco to watsonville 
the tremor caused some minor damage but there were no immediate 
reports of injuries 
the aftershock hit shortly before 10 pm and was felt in san 
francisco santa cruz and watsonville 
it rattled pretty good at first and then kept on kind of 
rolling you could feel the foundation swaying said ani 
leritzmurphy of watsonville 
the 950 pm aftershock measured 44 on the richter scale of 
ground motion and was centered slightly north of the epicenter of 
last months magnitude71 quake said pat jorgenson spokeswoman 
for the us geological survey in menlo park 
san francisco police said there was only minor damage in the 
citys marina district which was devastated by the main quake 
weve had a couple of reports of minor stuff nothing major at 
this time just bricks falling people calling in sheer panic 
saying the big one is on the way we try to console them and 
tell them its an aftershock said officer gordon clark 
awesome said santa cruz county sheriffs dispatcher kevin 
fink shook pretty good we were sweating bullets for a few 
seconds 
there have been thousands of aftershocks and 84 have had richter 
readings of at least 30 and 21 of magnitude40 or greater the 
strongest registered 52 just 37 minutes after the initial jolt 
this is one of the biggest ive felt since i got here on the 
19th said lt jeffrey babineu at the national guard armory in 
watsonville which is housing 100 people left homeless by the quake 
we heard a rumbling then everything started rolling and the 
cars in the parking lot started jumping around he said a few 
of the people in the shelter screamed out but then it stopped 
watsonville police received about a dozen calls from people who 
were worried about any additional damage the aftershock might have 
caused their already damaged homes said dispatcher terry hernandez 
apparently a lot of people ran out into the street she 
said we got a call from an apartment complex and they said 
everyone ran out 
she said there were no immediate reports of damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage

the house wants to give the transportation 
secretary new authority to halt airline mergers or leverage buyouts 
even though the secretary says he doesnt need more power 
the house on wednesday passed 300113 a bill to require 
government rejection of any airline takeover that might affect 
safety hinder competition cut a carriers size affect jobs or 
result in foreign control of an airline 
under the legislation which now goes to the senate the 
secretary is to determine whether transactions meet the standards 
before they are completed but he also will have the power to 
approve any merger if he believes it is in the public interest 
current law calls for a department review of airline 
acquisitions after they have been completed and based only on 
considerations of safety financial fitness and foreign control 
transportation secretary samuel skinner says he doesnt want the 
new authority and would recommend a presidential veto the vote 
exceeded the twothirds majority necessary to override a veto 
the house added two amendments which are opposed by democrat and 
republican leaders of the public works committee 
one change extended the authority to cover any takeover that 
would reduce wages benefits or the number of employees at the 
affected airline opponents said this would be interference in 
managementemployee relations 
another change aimed at texas air corp owner frank lorenzo 
would bar anyone who has sent more than one airline into bankruptcy 
from acquiring another airline lorenzo has filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization of eastern airlines and took a similar step with 
continental airlines 
the bill was prompted by increasing concern over leveraged 
buyouts in the airline industry including the sale of northwest 
airlines and aborted attempts to take over american and united 
airlines 
skinner last month used his review authority to force changes in 
alfred checchis buyout of northwests parent company nwa inc 
reducing the interest of klm royal dutch airlines 
skinner has said he has enough power under current law to stop 
unworthy takeovers 
the house rejected efforts by rep ron packard rcalif to 
make the secretarys rejection of takeovers discretionary rather 
than mandatory 
sponsors said the secretarys authority to determine whether a 
takeover is in the national interest gives him the necessary 
latitude

a mechanical digester is being developed to 
safely dispose of waste water after farm sprayers are flushed to 
rid them of pesticides says the agriculture department 
the departments agricultural research service said wednesday 
that the portable treatment uses ozone gas and soil microorganisms 
to break down unused pesticides before disposal 
cathleen j somich a chemist at the agencys beltsville md 
research facility said the goal is to turn unused pesticides into 
innocuous carbon dioxide instead of converting them into other 
toxic compounds that are disposed of by burning 
we dont want to take the risk of substituting air pollution 
for water pollution she said in an agency report 
cibageigy corp of greensboro nc has entered into a 
cooperative agreement with the agency to continue with the 
development of the procedure and the device to see if it can handle 
larger volumes of pesticide officials said 
the treatment was originated at beltsville somich and agency 
colleagues a year ago tested the original apparatus with seed money 
from cibageigy using it on 150 gallons of typical pesticide 
soup consisting of detergent and water used to clean corn 
herbicides from spray tanks 
within three days the treatment destroyed between 46 percent 
and 96 percent of the chemicals used in the sprayer by subjecting 
them to a digestion process aided by the ozone gas 
somich said that pesticides are resistant to microbial digestion 
but the ozone treatment oxidizes and makes them more biodegradable 
the technology is far from the commercial stage but steve 
dumford cibageigys director of new technology and basic 
research said he envisions the device one day being transported 
from farm to farm for the treatment of pesticides and waste water 
left over from cleaning chemical sprayers 
department officials said the process might also be used by lawn 
care companies

the white house denies it has a litmus 
test for its appointments but concedes dr antonia novello never 
would have been named surgeon general if her abortion views clashed 
with those of president bush 
novellos selection as the nations chief public health officer 
was announced on wednesday a pediatrician and expert on aids in 
children she would be the first woman and the first hispanic to 
hold the post if confirmed by the senate 
she would succeed the outspoken c everett koop who served for 
seven years 
her nomination comes amid controversy over white house 
questioning of candidates for a variety of health positions on 
their abortion views 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater acknowledged such 
screening took place but defended it we dont hire people that 
dont support our policies he said 
in this case novello supports the presidents policies he 
said 
although the presidents own position has changed since 1980 
when he voiced support for the roe vs wade supreme court decision 
legalizing abortion he currently opposes all abortions except to 
protect the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest 
on the issue of federal funds his views are more restrictive 
within the past month he vetoed two bills that sought to expand 
federally financed medicaid abortions to include cases of rape or 
incest 
the current restriction supported by bush only permits the 
use of federal funds to pay for abortions for poor women when the 
mothers life is in danger 
fitzwater on wednesday insisted theres no litmus test for 
top appointments 
still fitzwater continued you can call it whatever you want 
but the fact is yes anybody who is coming into a policymaking 
position will be asked what their beliefs are and whether they can 
support our policies 
we dont hire people that dont support our policies that is 
a hard and fast rule fitzwater said 
however he said the rule does not apply to judicial 
appointments or to government jobs below the policymaking level 
it does apply however to officials approximately from the rank of 
assistant cabinet secretary on up he said 
louis w sullivan the secretary of health and human services 
found his own selection by then presidentelect bush in jeopardy 
last december when he was quoted in an atlanta newspaper as 
favoring a proabortionrights stance 
sullivan who then was the president of the morehouse school of 
medicine issued a statement to clarify his position to assert 
it was entirely consistent with bushs 
novellos nomination had been widely reported in advance of 
wednesdays announcement 
a native of puerto rico novello 45 is deputy director of the 
national institute of child health and human development one of 
the national institutes of health she is also coordinator for aids 
research 
she graduated from the university of puerto rico and in 1970 
from the universitys medical school in the top 5 percent of her 
class 
she is married to dr joe novello a child psychiatrist who 
hosted a talk show on a washington radio station offering advice 
for troubled adolescents her brotherinlaw is don novello the 
comedian better known as father guido sarducci

an advisor to energy secretary james d 
watkins is questioning the success of watkins effort to improve 
safety at the idled savannah river reactors that make gas for 
nuclear warheads 
john ahearne chairman of watkins independent advisory panel on 
nuclear safety said wednesday that watkins stricter safety 
approach apparently has not yet penetrated the middle management 
and lowerlevel workers at savannah river 
what we are questioning is the effectiveness of 
safetyrelated improvement programs at savannah river which is 
operated by westinghouse electric corp under an energy department 
contract ahearne said in a telephone interview 
the ahearne panel said in a letter to watkins last friday that 
westinghouse appeared to be relying on its training program to 
impart the new emphasis on safety 
this will not be enough the letter said 
at savannah river near aiken sc westinghouse spokeswoman 
becky apter said the company has made numerous improvements in 
safety training programs to bring the plant up to the standards of 
the civilian nuclear industry 
ms apter declined to directly dispute the ahearne panels 
assertions but said the group was told during a visit to the plant 
last september that numerous improvements were under way including 
training on reactor simulators 
ahearnes group applauded what it called numerous positive 
changes at savannah river since westinghouse took over last april 
but it also raised serious questions 
procedural errors and reporting problems continue and indicate 
that an emphasis on safety of operations is not yet pervasive 
the panel said in its report to watkins 
the plants nuclear reactors the nations only source of 
tritium used to make nuclear warheads have been shut down for more 
than a year for safety reasons that include doubts about the skills 
and attitudes of plant workers 
an accident during an attempted restart of one savannah river 
reactor in august 1988 led to the hiatus the accident was 
attributed in part to operator error and led to investigations that 
uncovered deepseated safety lapses 
watkins has made getting the savannah river reactors running 
again by next year a top priority 
ahearne panels conclusions suggest savannah rivers flaws are 
far from fixed 
the panel said it was generally pleased with westinghouses 
program for training reactor operators but the training was 
missing coverage of reactors fundamentals that are always 
included in training for commercial nuclear plants 
this omission may belie westinghouses claim that safety 
is their primary concern the report said 
watkins has raised questions about westinghouses commitment to 
savannah river 
in a letter to westinghouse president paul lego in july watkins 
said his review of the companys blueprint for restarting the 
reactors caused him concern that westinghouse still does not 
appreciate the magnitude of the problems it faces 
copies of the july 17 letter and legos response were obtained 
wednesday by the associated press under the freedom of information 
act 
watkins citing a concern that ahearne said still remains 
suggested to lego that more competent people should be assigned to 
savannah river to resolve the safety problems 
let me reiterate that i am more concerned with the 
capabilities of the individuals involved than numbers of people 
watkins wrote it would be a grave mistake to imagine that the 
problems cited can be corrected merely by adding to the numbers

president bushs nomination of debra r 
bowland to head the labor departments wage and hour division will 
not get to the senate floor because of a senate panels vote 
against her confirmation 
the labor and human resources committee voted 96 on wednesday 
not to send her nomination to the full senate 
opponents focused on bowlands campaign to repeal louisianas 
prevailing wage law the state equivalent of the federal 
davisbacon law that sets wage scales for work on government 
construction contracts the law is a favorite of organized labor 
prevailing wages are the going pay and benefits in a geographic 
area and usually are tied to union scales critics of the law say 
it artificially raises the cost of construction 
committee chairman edward m kennedy dmass criticized the 
nomination holding up copies of the federal and state laws and 
saying they were virtually identical 
this is the law she would have to implement and this is the 
law she could not implement kennedy said 
bowland 45 began fighting the louisiana law while she was 
state labor secretary from 1980 to 1982 under gov david treen a 
republican she later campaigned against the law as a lobbyist 
bowland told senators at a hearing last week that she could 
enforce the federal law 
but democrats said her vigorous past lobbying proved her deep 
philosophical objection to government involvement in wage and hour 
matters 
this is putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop said 
sen brock adams dwash 
sen paul simon dill added we shouldnt put somebody in 
charge of a law that they dont believe in period 
but sen james m jeffords rvt said bowland opposed the 
louisiana law because of problems with implementation and 
regulations 
they noted it was repealed after her involvement and under a 
democratic administration 
bowland has been with the labor department since 1985 and heads 
the womens bureau

a new book on the 1969 chappaquiddick case 
alleges that sen edward m kennedy may have staged the fatal 
bridge accident to cover up an earlier car wreck that same night 
in a book released today to washington media author kenneth 
kappel said previously overlooked evidence indicates that 
kennedy may have pushed his black oldsmobile off the dyke bridge to 
cover up an earlier accident and to conceal his own drunken state 
kennedys senate office had no immediate reaction to the book 
titled chappaquiddick revealed the book raises new 
allegations about the events of july 18 1969 when the 
massachusetts democrat and 28yearold mary jo kopechne were 
involved in an accident that claimed kopechnes life 
the book is published by shapolsky publishers inc a small new 
york firm 
gwen and joseph kopechne the victims parents released a 
statement calling for kennedy to respond 
we believe that mr kappels book does present new evidence 
and that it is worthy of serious attention the kopechnes said 
kappels book contends the car driven by kennedy with ms 
kopechne in the passenger seat was involved in an accident on dry 
land on chappaquiddick island according to kappel the car rolled 
over onto its roof the author theorized that kennedy believed 
kopechne was killed in the accident got help in righting the car 
and then pushed it off the dyke bridge 
kappels book said all of the damage to the car could not have 
been caused by the plummet off the wooden bridge and that 
bloodstains found on ms kopechnes blouse were dried stains from a 
previous accident also he said a dangling left sideview mirror 
could indicate a common technique in pushing cars into water tying 
the mirror to the steering wheel to steady the vehicle

the bush administration is allowing the rising 
fever over abortion politics to get in the way of scientific 
research say critics of a ban on the use of federal money for 
fetal tissue research 
a top federal health official said wednesday he intends to 
extend indefinitely the ban on using tissue from intentional 
abortions in federal research assistant health secretary james 
mason contended wednesday such testing could create a demand for 
more abortions 
i see this as suppression of legitimate science in the federal 
sector said john c fletcher director of the center for 
biomedical ethics at the university of virginia when political 
considerations dominate science it concerns me very very much 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the house energy and 
commerce health subcommittee said continuing the ban would be an 
indication that the bush administration is giving up any pretense 
about caring about research or treating sick people or curing 
chronic disease 
he added the whole administration has become paralyzed by 
fear of the abortion issue when thats not the main issue before 
us 
waxman called on health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan to reverse a decision planned by mason to extend the ban 
he said sullivans job as secretary is to lead not hide 
but hhs sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
sullivan will concur with masons decision an announcement was 
expected today 
conservatives have pressed the administration to continue the 
ban warning that lifting it would create a firestorm of protest 
from antiabortion groups 
the ban was imposed a year ago by masons predecessor as 
assistant secretary for health robert windom when he rejected a 
proposed project at the national institutes of health in which 
scientists would transplant fetal tissue into patients with 
parkinsons disease 
windom also formed a special advisory committee to study whether 
such federally funded research should continue late last year the 
committee recommended lifting the ban 
the ban does not include fetal tissue from spontaneous abortions 
and does not constrain privately financed research using tissue 
from induced abortions 
scientists believe that research using tissue from aborted 
fetuses could help treat parkinsons disease and other incurable 
conditions the tissue is valued for its unique properties and 
quick growth allowing it to adapt quickly to new environments 
the focus of fetal tissue research so far has been on 
parkinsons disease but experts say it may also be useful in 
treating other neurological degenerative diseases 
nih is supposed to be a partner with science in the private 
area said fletcher who was chief of the bioethics program at 
the clinical center at nih for a decade this is the only area in 
our scientific life that is being systematically suppressed in the 
federal sector 
mason a strong abortion foe said he opposes using federal 
money to support research on fetal tissue from induced abortions 
for moral reasons saying it could lead to more abortions 
ultimately he said society would have to trade off the rights 
of a fetus for those of a patient suffering from parkinsons 
disease or other condition that might benefit from fetal tissue 
even those that strongly favor fetal tissue transplantation 
acknowledge that a strict wall would have to be erected between the 
abortion decision and the decision to use fetal tissue in 
transplantation research mason said such a distinction is 
easy to theorize but i just dont believe that such a neat 
separation can be accomplished 
for anyone who believes that a fetus has some rights then i 
just find that this is unacceptable public policy he said

the government is imposing tighter standards 
for radioactive releases from hospitals nuclear power plants and 
other facilities but some environmentalists say the rules dont go 
far enough 
hospitals research labs and atomic power plants already meet 
the new requirements set by the environmental protection agency 
officials said wednesday 
some environmentalists complained the new regulations do not go 
far enough and allow too high a cancer risk for residents living 
near such facilities 
the environmental protection agency said the tighter standards 
aim at reducing the cancer risk from industrial radioactive 
releases to no greater than 1 in 10000 over a lifetime for persons 
living near the facility causing the pollution today those risks 
are from two to 12 times as great near some of the facilities the 
epa said 
the rules will protect public health from the risks of 
industrial radioactivity said william rosenberg the epas 
assistant administrator for air and radiation 
but some environmentalists said even tighter controls are needed 
on industrial radionuclide emissions which are a byproduct of many 
nuclear processes used in industry and medicine they maintain that 
a minimum risk level of 1 cancer in 1 million over a lifetime is 
justified for even persons living near the facilities 
we in the environmental community are not prepared to call 1 
in 10000 a safe level of exposure said david doniger an 
attorney for the natural resources defense council 
rosenberg said the risk level sought by the environmentalists 
would be counterproductive because it would result in significant 
reductions in the amount of radioactive therapy for cancer the 
national institutes of health maintained in comments to the epa 
that tighter controls might result in the added loss of life 
because it could hamper some cancer treatments 
the new epa regulations were issued 10 years after the federal 
clean air act called on the agency to establish emission standards 
for radioactive byproducts a lawsuit by environmentalists directed 
that the epa produce the new standards 
the new emissions requirements cover nearly 7000 facilities 
including hospitals research laboratories pharmaceutical plants 
atomic waste storage plants and electric utility generating plants 
as well as uranium mines 
richard guimond director of the epas office of radiation said 
most of the facilities already meet the new standard 
nevertheless he estimated that currently as many as 10000 
people may live in areas where exposure to radioactive pollution 
poses a cancer risk greater than the 1 in 10000 required by the 
new regulation 
among those facilities that according to the epa will have to 
curb radioactive emissions to come into compliance with the new 
requirements are 
seven of the countrys 15 underground uranium mines at a cost 
to the industry of 400000 a year as many as five of the mines 
may choose instead to shut down officials said 
a number of energy department sites where excessive radon is 
released from radioactive wastes some dating back to the early 
days of the nuclear program in the 1940s and 1950s 
some of the countrys five operating elemental phosphorous 
plants where health risks to nearby residents exceed epa standards 
a phosphorous plant in pocatello idaho likely will have to 
install a 24 million scrubber to reduce emissions because 
radioactive pollution there poses an estimated cancer risk 12 times 
as great as the 1 in 10000 standard allows according to the epa

the senate is closing its doors for the second 
time in two weeks to debate the ouster of a federal judge as it 
moves toward a decision in the impeachment trial of walter l nixon 
jr of mississippi 
the evidence against judge nixon is overwhelming rep don 
edwards dcalif said wednesday as senate floor action got under 
way to maintain the integrity of the judiciary he must be 
removed 
nixon currently living in a new orleans halfway house for 
former prisoners would be the seventh federal official removed by 
impeachment and the second judge ousted in two weeks if convicted 
by the senate 
as a us district judge he continues to collect an 89500 
government salary and says he would like to return to the bench and 
preside over trials despite his 1986 conviction for lying under 
oath to a federal grand jury 
the house on may 10 approved 4170 three articles of impeachment 
against the 61yearold judge conviction in the senate on any one 
of them would automatically remove him from the bench 
the senate planned to go into closed session today to debate the 
matter after hearing final arguments on wednesday lawmakers were 
likely to put off a vote until friday 
the senate on oct 20 ousted alcee l hastings from the us 
district court in miami on charges he plotted to obtain a bribe and 
lied to a jury that acquitted him of that charge in 1983 
nixon was convicted of lying to a federal grand jury in denying 
he talked with a local prosecutor and old friend paul holmes 
about marijuanasmuggling charges against drew fairchild the son 
of a wealthy contractor 
holmes was district attorney of forrest county miss at the 
time and the marijuana charges became inactive after the 
discussion prosecutors said 
nixon took the senate floor and denied any wrongdoing he said 
witnesses against him lied and that overzealous prosecutors held 
him to an unfairly high standard of accuracy in his sworn 
statements 
i had nothing to hide nixon said i had done nothing 
wrong i had not committed any corrupt act why would i lie 
about something that i hadnt done 
he assured lawmakers he had always acted fairly in his courtroom 
in accord with advice from my good friend sen john c stennis 
stennis retired in 1988 after representing mississippi in the 
senate for four decades 
i have served honestly and faithfully as a federal judge for 
21 years nixon said i have always been mindful that i was 
appointed not anointed 
defense counsel david stewart acknowledged forgetfulness in 
nixons testimony but said there was no attempt to deceive the 
government 
one of the house managers of the case rep james sensenbrenner 
rwis scoffed at that notion are they deceits or just a series 
of mistakes he said in an incredulous voice fourteen 
mistakes 
stewart also told the senate the charges against nixon did not 
accurately reflect the actual words of the judge when he was under 
oath 
they are asking you to send him to dishonor in history for 
lying about statements that he didnt make stewart said 
nixon said it would be understandable if senators believed 
something is wrong merely because the case has come before them 
there is something wrong with this situation nixon said 
but what is wrong is that i am paying a debt that is not owed 
from the very beginning the goal of the federal prosecutors was to 
get the federal judge no matter what it took and it took plenty

the bush administration is telling exile 
leaders of the afghan resistance it will keep sending them arms to 
fight the sovietbacked government in afghanistan officials say 
they assured us of their continued support said farooq 
azam the education minister of the afghan interim government 
which is based in peshawar pakistan near the border with 
afghanistan 
azam led a delegation that met wednesday with vice president dan 
quayle and on tuesday with secretary of state james a baker iii 
a spokesman for the vice president david beckwith said 
quayle assured them of our continuing support we continue to 
support an independent and representative government for 
afghanistan 
us military assistance to the mujahedeen guerrillas slackened 
after soviet troops withdrew last february hampering efforts to 
dislodge government forces from heavily fortified cities azam said 
in an interview 
this year we did not even receive the amount we received last 
year he said our friends have slowed down their assistance 
deliveries have resumed say us officials who spoke on 
condition they not be identified they declined to discuss details 
of the covert program which was estimated at close to 600 million 
last year 
asked whether the aid was sufficient to dislodge government 
forces from fortified cities they have occupied azam said we 
will see 
the mujahedeen need more weapons now he said because they are 
mounting offensives and sieges against fortified military 
positions a tactic which generally requires more armaments than 
the guerrilla warfare used earlier 
we need support now more than ever he said 
us and mujahedeen sources say moscow has continued to send 
huge quantities of arms to the regime the russians left behind even 
though soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said last 
week the 1979 red army intervention in afghanistan violated moral 
and civilized behavior 
we believe that since the soviet withdrawal there has been a 
kind of thinking in the united states that the war is over azam 
said 
in talks with quayle and baker he said we made our point 
that the war is not over 
the soviets left 2 billion worth of military hardware when they 
withdrew and have sent an additional 3 billion since then said 
azam 
the increase in soviet aid and drop in us assistance 
frustrated mujahedeen efforts to take cities such as jalalabad in 
eastern afghanistan he said 
the dec 23 meeting between president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev was not discussed in the meetings with 
administration officials said azam 
we dont think that the united states will reach an agreement 
with the soviet union that would harm the resistance he said

foreign nations are getting the message that 
the united states will no longer tolerate the theft of its films 
records books and computer software an administration official 
says 
us trade representative carla a hills said wednesday eight 
nations considered the worst violators of us intellectual 
property rights have improved their copyright protection enough 
that they wont be subject to increased pressure allowed under the 
1988 omnibus trade act 
the act calls for any nation placed on a priority nations 
list to face an accelerated sixmonth investigation 
i am encouraged by the genuine progress made in the protection 
of intellectual property by our trading partners hills said in a 
prepared statement clearly our message has been received 
but the situation will be reviewed in april she added 
us companies have complained they are losing hundreds of 
millions of dollars a year to foreign pirates or to foreign 
government policies that exclude american competitors 
in its 1988 trade law congress directed the trade 
representative to identify nations that violate us copyrights or 
deny access to us intellectual property 
on may 25 hills singled out 25 countries naming eight to a 
priority watch list and saying talks would begin with them 
hills said south korea taiwan and saudi arabia had made enough 
improvement that they were downgraded from the priority watch list 
to simple watch list status 
the other five brazil india mexico peoples republic of 
china and thailand will remain on the priority watch list 
tougher pressure could have been called for if the countries had 
been upgraded to the higher priority nations list 
hills said saudi arabia had agreed to enact a copyright law 
taiwan issued highlevel policy statements moved towards better 
law enforcement and initialed a bilateral copyright agreement and 
south korea had improved policing efforts 
eric smith general counsel for the international intellectual 
property alliance said the group was pleased overall with hills 
decision but that april will provide a litmus test of these 
nations intentions 
he said his group also was concerned that by dropping taiwan 
and korea particularly off the priority watch list its not a 
sign they can lay off their commitment to enforcement 
in both countries they have made some improvements in the 
enforcement area but theyre not there yet smith said 
he said it would be a major advance if saudi arabia enacts a 
copyright law which smith said would be a first for a persian gulf 
nation 
jay berman president of the recording industry association of 
america said hills had won meaningful negotiations but the 
real test is whether theyre going to produce concrete results on 
an ongoing basis 
smith said there had not been much progress reported in talks 
with the other five nations and his alliance recommended turkey 
and malaysia be added to the priority watch list 
she didnt do that but she did specially warn them that they 
have to start dealing with copyright issues smith said 
the special 301 authority allows the administration to negotiate 
improvements in copyright protection and market access directly 
with other nations or through the 97nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade

officials at three mile islands nuclear 
plant say they will be ready in about a month to begin evaporating 
23 million gallons of slightly radioactive water left from the 
march 1979 accident and cleanup 
a second stage of testing was scheduled to begin this week and 
the water will be pumped into boilers by early december said joe 
kuehn unit 2 site operations director 
he and tmi2 director michael roche briefed reporters wednesday 
to show off the 4 million projects equipment 
this is certainly one of the bigger milestones roche said 
of the expected startup 
two antinuclear groups three mile island alert and the 
susquehanna valley alliance have appealed the nuclear regulatory 
commissions approval of evaporation to an administrative board and 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
tmi unit 2 was damaged on march 28 1979 during the nations 
worst commercial nuclear power plant accident 
water laced with tritium cesium strontium carbon boron and 
sodium will be boiled distilled then reboiled the steam will be 
sent through a thin 100foot high stack and vented into the air 
the 5gallonaminute process will remove all but the tritium a 
radiation monitor attached to the system will automatically block 
releases if excessive radiation levels are detected in water headed 
to the final boiler 
this is not a new technology kuehn said 
he said the treated water being boiled this way is much cleaner 
than water normally subjected to industrial evaporation 
kuehn said the doses from the tritium releases will be no more 
than 12 millirems for someone who would have to stand at the plant 
boundary during the whole evaporation process people usually 
receive about 300 millirems a year from naturally occurring 
radiation 
six additional tritium monitors have been deployed in areas 
around the plant including one in york about 10 miles away he 
said 
he said officials expect the monitors will show levels above 
background radiation but that the average dose for people within 
50 miles of the plant would be 0005 millirem 
he said the amount of tritium in the 23 million gallons of 
water is equivalent to about 18 drops 
solids left from the evaporation will be mixed with water and 
turned into pellets that will be placed in 55gallon drums and 
shipped to a lowlevel nuclear disposal area in hanford wash the 
evaporation will produce one to two drums of solids a day or a 
total of 5000 to 10000 cubic feet

cartoonist garry trudeau has sued the writers 
guild of america for 10 million claiming the union harassed him 
because he refused to participate in a strike against a company he 
coowns 
the creator of the doonesbury comic strip said his 
independent television production company darkhorse productions 
was caught up in the unions 1988 strike against the television and 
motion picture industry 
he said the guild did not serve darkhorse with a 60day notice 
of intent to strike as required by law and he refused to 
participate in what he termed the unlawful strike against 
darkhorse 
the lawsuit contends the union launched a deliberate campaign to 
harass and punish trudeau a guild member for his association with 
darkhorse and his refusal to participate in the strike 
marty waldman a spokesman for the union said it would have no 
comment until its lawyers reviewed the suit 
the suit was filed tuesday in us district court

federal savings and loan regulator m danny 
wall says his congressional critics arent giving him a fair chance 
to respond to charges he mishandled the nations largest thrift 
institution failure 
fair play clearly has not been evident much less due 
process he said wednesday in an interview at his office a block 
from the white house 
the house banking committee is investigating the collapse of 
lincoln savings and loan association an irvine calif thrift 
controlled by phoenix ariz millionaire charles h keating jr 
in three hearings the committee has collected reams of 
testimony critical of walls handling of the collapse which is 
expected to cost taxpayers between 15 billion and 2 billion 
making it the nations costliest sampl failure 
committee aides say the panel will hear from wall later this 
month but a firm date hasnt been set and wall said he is 
concerned public opinion will harden and congress may even recess 
until next year before he gets a chance to tell his side of the 
story 
the public sees silence as being an admission of guilt i 
clearly will be eager to respond to every question that is 
asked wall said 
the committee is focusing on why wall as chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board now called the office of thrift 
supervision rejected a 1987 recommendation from his agencys san 
francisco office to take over lincoln and instead ordered a second 
examination supervised by regulators from washington which 
delayed the seizure of the institution until this april 
michael patriarca director of the thrift agencys san francisco 
office and william k black counsel in the office told the 
committee they had uncovered sufficient losses and irregularities 
at lincoln to justify its seizure two years ago 
however wall said the san francisco examiners only had enough 
information to justify an order restricting some of lincolns 
activities the new examination supervised by different regulators 
avoided a lawsuit blocking access to records of lincolns parent 
company american continental corp he said 
and the second examination eventually produced the evidence 
needed by the government to seize the sampl wall said 
its absolutely crystal clear what would have occurred other 
than our having used the approach of a clean set of examiners we 
may have been delayed further he said 
wall called patriarca a very competent regulator and noted 
he had recently reappointed him but asked why he did not dismiss 
him for presenting what he considered onesided testimony to the 
house panel wall said we will consider all of what needs to be 
considered at an appropriate time 
im not threatening anybody he said im clearly not 
rushing to judgment just as i dont want anyone to rush to judgment 
on me 
patriarca has complained that wall without informing examiners 
in san francisco met with keating three times wall said the 
sessions did not influence his thinking but conceded its very 
difficult to prove the negative 
he also said he was unimpressed that keating was able to 
persuade two senators and a member of the house banking committee 
to intervene on behalf of lincoln 
im not blase about senators dont misunderstand me wall 
said on the other hand im not impressed by the fact that 
someone can talk to x number of senators 
sen alan cranston dcalif called wall soon after he began a 
fouryear term as the nations top thrift regulator in july 1987 
after leaving a post as chief republican aide on the senate banking 
committee cranston was attempting to prod the agency into deciding 
whether or not to take action against lincoln 
early this year cranston sen dennis deconcini dariz and 
rep carroll hubbard dky called to urge speedy consideration of 
keatings proposal to sell lincoln he said 
cranston and deconcini are among five senators who received 
large campaign contributions from keating 
wall brushed off a call from the chairman of the house 
committee rep henry b gonzalez dtexas to step aside saying 
he wanted to see his agency through its reorganization as a wing of 
the treasury department 
i have a job to do here i believe and i want to see it 
through he said

scientists believe fetal tissue is a promising 
source for research into diseases such as parkinsons and 
alzheimers and even may help correct the afflictions of unborn 
children 
but there are advocates on the other side who fear that such 
research could subtly encourage women to have abortions 
a ban on using federal money for fetal tissue research was 
imposed a year ago and james mason assistant secretary for health 
at the department of health and human services told reporters 
wednesday he intends to continue it indefinitely 
the problem is the source of fetal tissue thats the 
concern said dr susan black a geneticist at fairfax va 
hospital in an interview of course the tissue would be coming 
from abortions they are afraid people will do this in order just 
to have fetal tissue and thats not the intention at all 
she said for example that earlier diagnosis of fetal tissues 
has much potential for correcting such problems as immune 
deficiency at an early stage of pregnancy 
the question is she said can you correct that problem and 
therefore have an intact fetus in which the options that a parent 
might have are not just to not continue that pregnancy but to 
treat the disease before the baby is born 
fetal tissue has the advantage of being still in the process of 
developing and thus able to deliver materials that an older cell no 
longer can said robert c baumiller director of the division of 
genetics at georgetown university 
what the fetal cell does better than any cell from an 
individual after birth is to grow he said there are growth 
factors present within a fetal human which are unique to that 
system so they have a vitality that is unique 
baumiller said scientists believe it would be a shame not to put 
fetuses to some positive use such as helping victims of 
degenerative diseases such as parkinsons and alzheimers 
some experts believe it may be possible to treat a variety of 
diseases by transplanting tissue taken from aborted fetuses there 
were especially hopeful signs in use of such tissues in treating 
parkinsons disease 
because of parkinsons we think there might be some advantage 
with other neurological degenerative diseases especially those 
with cells which are kind of sister cells said baumiller the 
next question would be if it helps in alzheimers disease could 
it help perhaps in huntingtons any place where you have a 
neurological degenerative condition 
dr robert hay head of the cell culture department of the 
american type culture collection in rockville md said fetal 
cells have provided information on aging and cell transformation 
the change from normal to cancerous properties and in virus 
replication studies and studies of chemicals that affect human 
cells 
some argue that there is enough primate research already being 
carried out that no one needs human fetal research 
human cells behave differently than cells from animals said 
hay there are properties of human cells we obviously need to 
know about that differ from those of a mouse or a rat 
the ethics of using tissue from aborted fetuses were studied 
recently by a committee at stanford university which drew up 
guidelines that include 
women who undergo abortions should not benefit directly from 
the medical use of their fetuses they should not be reimbursed for 
their abortions 
medical personnel who perform abortions also should not profit 
from use of the fetal tissue 
fetal tissue should be treated with the respect given to 
cadavers 
fetuses should not be aborted for the specific purpose of using 
their tissue

the labor department is seeking a record 73 
million fine from usx corp for 2000 alleged safety violations at 
two steel plants including hazards the government says were blamed 
for fatalities but not corrected 
the magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only 
by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from 
corporate indifference to worker safety and health labor 
secretary elizabeth dole said wednesday 
the departments occupational safety and health administration 
accused usx of permitting some of the violations at the 
pennsylvania plants even though the company agreed two years ago to 
eliminate them at all its facilities 
company managers had known about many of these safety and 
health deficiencies at the plants for years yet have failed to 
take necessary action to correct the hazards said assistant 
labor secretary gerard f scannell who heads osha 
usx has 15 working days to contest the citations and fines 
usx spokesman thomas ferrall said company officials would review 
the citations before commenting on specifics but denied they 
ignored safety concerns 
there is no consideration more important than the health and 
safety of our employees ferrall said in a telephone interview 
our commitment to all of our people at all of our plants is to 
provide a safe and healthy workplace we think we are doing that 
ferrall said the company cooperated with osha and corrected 
safety problems discovered during the investigation 
but mike wright safety director for the united steelworkers of 
america union said only some of the problems had been corrected 
were sorry that it came to this but we think that the 
citations are well deserved said wright the union has had 
real problems with both plants for some time weve got safety 
problems at all their plants 
the agency accused usx of 1628 violations at its fairless hills 
steel mill on the pennsylvania side of the delaware river near 
trenton nj and proposed a fine of 6095600 that is the 
highest fine osha has ever proposed for violations at one work site 
the company was accused of 376 violations at its clairton coke 
works near pittsburgh osha proposed a fine of 1202600 for those 
the alleged violations include failure to provide safe walking 
and working surfaces substandard cranesafety standards failure 
to properly guard machines and power transmission equipment noise 
violations failure to keep accurate records of injuries and 
illnesses structural flaws and violations of electricalsafety 
standards 
the citations stem from osha inspections that began in may at 
the clairton works which has 1500 workers and in june at 
fairless works which employs 4000 the steelworkers filed a 
complaint that triggered the clairton inspection employee 
complaints led to the other osha said there have been three worker 
fatalities at the two plants in the last two years and 17 since 
1972 
the proposed fines total 7298200 the previous record was 
51 million against companies involved in a building collapse at 
bridgeport conn the largest for a single company was 43 million 
against john morrell co two years ago for alleged violations at 
meatpacking plants both the bridgeport and morrell fines are 
being contested 
osha often accepts lesser amounts after negotiations with the 
companies involved

nicaraguas president daniel ortega says in an 
article on the oped page of todays new york times that president 
bush has blocked all efforts to demobilize and disarm the contras 
he has kept the contras intact militarily by continuing to 
provide them with nonlethal assistance ortega writes 
and concerning the presidential elections scheduled in 
nicaragua in february ortega says 
i shall continue doing everything i can to insure that the 
current electoral process remains democratic and that as in 1984 
our elections are judged free and fair by the international 
observers 
he said bush delivered a torrent of personal invective 
against him at the meeting of hemispheric leaders in costa rica 
last week 
he accused me of spoiling the garden party in costa rica 
by announcing he would end the ceasefire ortega said well 
life in my country is no garden party he continued eight 
years of war financed and directed by the reagan and bush 
adminstrations have seen to that 
ortega defended his decision to cancel the ceasefire saying 
the contras had steppedup their military activity threatening the 
election process 
the only way to achieve peace in nicaragua is to disband the 
ussupported rebels he wrote 
we do not consider it an acceptable ceasefire when we cease 
and the contras fire he said

sen orrin hatch says if the federal 
government can give money to residents of pacific islands affected 
by atomic testing theres no good reason not to do the same for 
residents of western states 
hatch and rep wayne owens both of utah called wednesday for a 
house panel to set up a 100 million trust fund for what owens 
called the nations forgotten guinea pigs in the development of 
nuclear weapons 
the republican senator and democratic congressman have teamed up 
on similar measures before but have never been able to get 
legislation out of committee 
they are more optimistic this year pointing out congress 
created a special fund for japanese people who were locked in us 
camps during world war ii and also voted assistance for veterans 
exposed to atomic radiation while on duty 
several civilians exposed to fallout from the nevada test site 
during the 1950s have won judgments in federal courts only to have 
them overturned on appeal because of a federal law that generally 
shields the government from lawsuits 
the house judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and 
government relations is considering broader legislation that would 
expand the right to sue the federal government if negligence can be 
proved 
but there was no indication how soon the panel will act on that 
or the onepurpose hatchowens bill 
hatch said the senate made history in 1985 by acknowledging in 
its approval of the marshall island compact that atomic testing 
fallout damaged the health of pacific islanders and by authorizing 
payments for the residents 
hatch said he fell eight votes short at the time of winning 
similar treatment for residents of the united states 
called downwinders the people exposed to fallout from open 
air nuclear testing in nevada in the 1950s live mainly in southern 
nevada southern utah and northwestern arizona 
hatch said the trust fund he is proposing would amount to only 
a fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of 
the problems that the government has caused 
he said the cases of those who mined uranium in colorado new 
mexico arizona and utah from 1947 to 1961 may be even more 
appalling 
even though the government had adequate warning of the hazards 
involved these miners most of whom were native americans were 
sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no 
instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation he said 
owens called the mining and testing as an unnoticed part of 
this nations nuclear cold war with the soviets 
the residents of this region were used as guinea pigs in a 
deadly experiment he said 
he noted a house subcommittee concluded a decade ago 
sufficient evidence exists for the federal government to accept 
at least compassionate responsibility 
then after wringing its hands over the suffering of these 
forgotten guinea pigs congress unfortunately forgot again said 
owens who said his brotherinlaw a former uranium miner 
recently died of lung cancer 
assistant attorney general stuart m gerson head of the justice 
departments civil division said the administration opposes the 
legislation because it would dramatically change current law by 
making the united states subject to unprecedented liability for 
implementing policy decisions and functions

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee says soviet president mikhail s gorbachev appears to be 
carrying out his pledge to make sizeable cuts in soviet forces in 
eastern europe 
but rep les aspin dwis added that soviet forces have also 
increased artillery strength in eastern europe gorbachev has said 
8500 artillery pieces would be cut from eastern europe and 
adjacent soviet territory 
it is still not certain gorbachev will fulfill a promise to 
reduce soviet troops overall by half a million men aspin said 
wednesday night 
we dont see that yet aspin said at the carnegie endowment 
for international peace a private research group its just hard 
for us to understand when they will do that 
gorbachev in a speech last december at the united nations 
promised to withdraw six tank divisions from east germany 
czechoslovakia and hungary within two years and reduce soviet 
forces in the warsaw pact countries by 50000 men 
he said the soviet union would also reduce the overall size of 
its armed forces by 500000 men 
a lot of unanswered questions remain about the force 
reductions west of the urals within soviet territory but the 
rest of the reductions seem to be taking place aspin said 
aspin said three of the six tank divisions have been withdrawn 
from eastern europe and a big chunk of the troops left with 
them 
he said the pullout contradicts the general impression that 
were still waiting for something to happen 
however aspin said the soviets have also increased their other 
military vehicles in eastern europe by about 20 percent and were 
adding more than 1000 artillery pieces or a boost of about 15 
percent 
the net result of all of that is that the capability of their 
forces in eastern europe would be reduced on the order of 20 
percent by december 1990 thats on track and irreversible 
he said 
aspin and other members of the armed services committee went on 
a twoweek trip to the soviet union and east germany in august 
hes halfway delivered in half of the time aspin said of 
gorbachev who will meet with president bush in a summit meeting 
off the mediterranean island of malta dec 23

secretary of states james a baker iii 
defense secretary dick cheney and other administration officials 
arrived today as part of the most senior us delegation to visit 
australia in more than 20 years 
the officials arrived for annual talks and for a 12nation 
conference that could put the asiapacific region on a new economic 
footing 
other members of the us group included commerce secretary 
robert a mosbacher and trade representative carla hills 
its the greatest conglomeration of us cabinet ministers 
ever here said an australian official 
us officials said it was the highestranking delegation since 
president lyndon b johnson visited in 1967 for the funeral of 
prime minister harold holt 
this years talks replace the annual anzus treaty consultations 
which included new zealand until that country adopted an 
antinuclear policy in 1984 that caused a major rift in its 
relations with the united states 
anzus takes its name from treaty partners australia new zealand 
and the united states new zealand while still a member no longer 
operates as a functioning partner 
australian officials said the bilateral talks likely would be 
overshadowed by the nov 57 asia pacific economic conference but 
welcomed the opportunity for the first time to discuss world 
affairs with members of the bush administration 
they said the talks were a chance for australia to learn 
firsthand the us view of developments in the east bloc in china 
and in disarmament 
cheney and hardisty were visiting for the bilateral meeting 
alone while mosbacher and mrs hills were heading straight to 
canberra the federal capital for the apec meeting which includes 
representatives from the six asean nations and australia new 
zealand canada japan and south korea

a gay account executive who won a 
weeklong companypaid vacation for two in hawaii has settled a 
discriminatory complaint against his company which would not allow 
him to take his male lover 
this settlement is another important step in the growing 
movement for equal recognition of lesbian and gay couples 
attorney william b rubenstein of the american civil liberties 
unions lesbian and gay rights project said in a statement 
jeffrey donohoe 29 won the trip based on his companys sales 
quota in 1987 the company offered to pay for his wife or female 
friend to accompany him but refused to pay for his male life 
partner with whom he had lived since 1984 
i certainly thought it was very unfair and discriminatory 
said donohoe who filed a complaint with the countys human 
relations commission 
last week donohoes employer agreed to change its policy to 
allow his friend to join him on companypaid vacations and to pay 
donohoe an undisclosed sum of cash gay rights advocates said the 
settlement carries symbolic weight 
the settlement overseen by the montgomery county human 
relations commission prohibits those involved from disclosing the 
name of the company or the amount of money it paid donohoe the 
employer described as a nationwide company avoided a public 
hearing on its apparent violation of the countys 
antidiscrimination law according to the aclu which represented 
donohoe 
rubenstein noted that the settlement followed two other more 
significant victories for gay rights advocates this year 
in july new yorks highest court ruled that a homosexual couple 
must be considered a family for the purposes of new york citys 
rent control law also san francisco passed a law giving unmarried 
heterosexual and gay couples the same housing and hospital 
visitation rights as married partners 
the montgomery county case is not of the same magnitude 
said nan hunter head of the lesbian and gay rights project its 
part of a trend more and more private employers and agencies are 
taking steps and will be forced to take steps to equalize 
benefits 
elizabeth symonds another aclu lawyer involved with the case 
said the settlement only applies to the companys montgomery county 
office

researchers said today they have greatly 
improved the ability of a crystal of superconducting material to 
carry electrical power by an oddsounding strategy they made 
defects in its structure 
the result boosts hopes for making practical use of the recently 
discovered class of compounds called hightemperature 
superconductors scientists said 
the study indicates that a solution is possible for one of two 
key obstacles to making the materials carry useful amounts of 
current said coauthor robert b van dover 
superconductors are materials that carry electricity without 
resistance all those discovered so far must be chilled to work 
in recent years scientists have created the hightemperature 
superconductors so called because they require less chilling than 
previously known materials scientists hope these compounds will 
have more uses than the previous materials 
researchers want to use these new materials in such applications 
as highpower magnets floating highspeed trains and devices for 
storing electrical power 
the new study addressed a barrier to such uses in a magnetic 
field bulk samples of hightemperature superconductor have been 
able to carry only small levels of electrical current without 
losing superconducting ability 
the researchers bombarded a crystal of superconducting material 
with neutrons tiny particles that make up parts of atoms the 
crystal could then carry about 100 times the current that untreated 
crystals could without losing superconductivity they found 
the neutron bombardment created structural defects within the 
crystal the researchers said 
these defects hampered the movement of tiny areas of magnetic 
field within the crystal movement of such magnetic fields causes 
electrical resistance spoiling the performance of the 
superconductor 
the performance of the bombarded crystal represents about a 
50fold improvement over what other researchers have attained with 
single crystals of bulk superconductor van dover said in a 
telephone interview 
it is comparable to the performance of extremely thin films of 
superconducting material said david welch of brookhaven national 
laboratory on long island thin films however are not practical 
for making magnets and other relatively largescale uses he said 
the crystal study is presented in todays issue of the british 
journal nature by van dover lynn schneemeyer em gyrogy and 
others at atampt bell laboratories in murray hill nj and 
scientists in sweden 
the work does not address a second crucial obstacle for bulk 
superconductors loss of currentcarrying capacity that occurs 
between crystals in a sample that problem is still out there 
van dover said 
in addition he said researchers would like to come up with a 
more practical method than neutron bombardment for creating 
improved superconductors he said 
nonetheless the work is encouraging for efforts to overcome 
currentcarrying limits within crystals it certainly indicates 
it is possible said welch 
brian maple of the university of california san diego called 
the study an important step toward solving the overall problem 
of low current capacity in bulk superconductors 
the experiments involved crystals containing the standard 
superconductor ingredients of yttrium barium copper and oxygen 
the neutronirradiated crystal achieved a critical current 
density of about 600000 amperes per square centimeter when 
chilled to minus 321 degrees fahrenheit and exposed to a magnetic 
field about 18000 times that of earth 
other researchers had previously reported improving 
superconductor performance by creating structural defects but they 
did not produce as dramatic an improvement maple said

pupils home on halloween authorities said 
attendance was back to normal wednesday 
this morning i think a lot of people are looking back and are 
embarrassed with themselves school superintendent norman carter 
said at least i hope so 
carter said a rumor apparently started in nearby fort valley 
where many butler residents work that 12 black cats had been 
sacrificed on the butler town square 
and from there it just got out of hand carter said until 
the rumor grew to include plans for kidnapping and sacrificing 
children on halloween 
he said about 175 parents kept their children out of the 
elementary school tuesday about onefourth of the schools 
students while the school administration discounted the rumors he 
said security was increased as a precaution

former attorney general of not telling the truth about 
abortion a key issue in the race 
coleman who trailed wilder by 15 percentage points in a recent 
poll challenged wilder to a showdown at the capitol today to 
explain why he directly and shamelessly misled voters about his 
position on a state law banning compulsory union membership 
the candidates have raised questions throughout the campaign 
about each others fitness for office but both were more pointed 
in the latest exchange wilders tv advertisement shows a portion 
of a coleman ad that began airing tuesday a week before the 
election in the portion of the ad coleman says lets set the 
record straight im not going to restrict abortions for rape or 
incest 
the wilder ad goes on to say that coleman an abortion opponent 
except to save the life of the mother has long campaigned on a 
pledge to ban the procedure and repeated the promise earlier this 
year in a letter to a group of clergymen 
marshall coleman is not telling the truth about abortion 
wilders ad says thats why we just cant trust marshall 
coleman 
in a letter coleman challenged wilder to show up this afternoon 
at the capitol to listen to a tape recording of a private meeting 
between wilder and united mine workers 
at the july 31 meeting wilder said he supported a 
freerider amendment to virginias righttowork law the law 
forbids labor contracts requiring workers to join a union but the 
amendment could force nonunion employees to pay dues to unions 
that negotiate agreements for them 
coleman contends the amendment would gut the righttowork law 
he wrote wilder that he would play the tape for reporters today 
whether wilder showed up or not 
either way the people of virginia are going to know how 
directly and shamelessly you tried to deceive them coleman wrote 
bj northington wilders deputy press secretary said wilder 
had no plans to meet coleman at the capitol 
its just another negative attack ms northington said 
wilder at a meeting with richmond business leaders pledged to 
keep the righttowork law as it is and to veto any effort to 
weaken it 
i dont go one place and say one thing and another place and 
say another wilder said he said the remark at the umw meeting 
did not contradict his position of support for the law and he 
said that support left the miners very upset with me

a state senator heavily favored to 
become this citys first black mayor is battling voter complacency 
rather than his toughtalking opponent as he strives to fulfill a 
20yearold dream 
sen john daniels said his easy victory in the democratic 
primary over a candidate who had won the partys endorsement 
electrified his supporters but also left many with the mistaken 
impression that the race was over 
i was out in a neighborhood the other day and when i knocked 
on the door a woman answered senator daniels you again didnt 
we just vote you into office we have to do that again 
a lot of people think im already the mayor there is a lot of 
apathy out there daniels said in a recent interview as his 
campaign staff prepared for a final getoutthevote push 
apathy was not a problem on primary day when 53 percent of the 
citys registered democrats voted the highest turnout in 10 years 
daniels scored well in all but a few wards to defeat former city 
administrator john destefano in the race to succeed retiring 
fiveterm mayor biagio dilieto 
democrats outnumber republicans by nearly 10to1 in this city 
of 127000 where blacks make up about 35 percent and hispanics 
about 12 percent of the population 
daniels 53 is a fiveterm state senator and former city 
alderman with a majority interest in a new haven plumbing business 
a former high school football standout who went to villanova on an 
athletic scholarship he is still active in sports as a college 
football referee 
his republican opponent is alderwoman robie pooley who says the 
senator is more interested in making history as the first black 
mayor of connecticuts third largest city than in committing 
himself to working full time in the job 
when daniels suggested early on that he might want to hold on to 
his senate seat while serving as mayor only to learn later that 
it was not legally possible he showed he did not appreciate the 
the totality of the job she said 
daniels said he will retain his financial stake in the plumbing 
company but will not work at the business he has no intention of 
giving up his job as a referee which requires him to work 10 games 
a year 
it doesnt interfere with my governing the city he said 
adding some mayors go out and play golf every day

the us embassy has issued its fourth protest in 
a week over a massive chinese police presence outside its compound 
and the harassment by guards of staff and visitors an embassy 
source said today 
also today china said the visit of former president nixon will 
help restore badly strained relations with the united states but 
insisted again that the blame for the strain lies with washington 
the embassy source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
latest verbal protest came wednesday hours before another night of 
provocations outside ambassador james lilleys residence 
on wednesday night about two dozen uniformed police and at 
least 10 plainclothes police congregated outside the gate to the 
residence shining a spotlight and forcing visitors to go through a 
gauntlet of armed guards 
another 20 policemen were posted on nearby streetcorners and 
along the street in front of the compound turning some cars away 
and forcing those going to the embassy to park hundreds of yards 
away even though there were many empty spaces near the gate 
when visitors tried to park closer to the embassy police banged 
on their cars and yelled at them to leave 
police cursed at a cbs crew that tried to film them and shined 
another spotlight into the crews camera 
a similar massing of police occurred tuesday evening only then 
they were armed with automatic rifles and did not carry spotlights 
in an apparent gesture to nixon the peoples armed police 
around the three american embassy compounds did not carry rifles 
wednesday for the first time in four months 
nixon aides said the former president told premier li peng he 
did not like guns and did not want to see rifletoting guards when 
he visited the embassy 
today guards continued to wear pistols and eight black or gray 
mercedes some without license plates were again parked along the 
street outside the ambassadors residence with men apparently 
plainclothes police seated inside 
the embassy also has complained of three cases of embassy staff 
finding their car tires slashed and security forces tailing embassy 
employees as they left the compounds 
twice in the past week armed police outside the embassy pointed 
their automatic rifles at children of us diplomats and pulled the 
trigger an embassy source said the guns were not loaded 
the only unusual event at the embassy recently was a halloween 
party last saturday where the arrival of people wearing costumes 
apparently rattled the chinese 
at least 80 police were called in seemingly to block chinese 
fugitives from sneaking into embassy grounds police became 
particularly upset when partygoers arrived carrying a fake coffin 
one man who came to the party dressed in a gorilla suit was told 
to park his car elsewhere 
premier li reportedly told nixon that the heavy guard most 
embassies have only one or two chinese police posted outside was 
necessary to prevent the escape of dissidents fang lizhi and his 
wife li shuxian who took refuge in the embassy after the june 4 
military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
fang and li wanted by chinese police as counterrevolutionary 
agitators remain in one of the embassy compounds 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing asked about the police 
harassment at a weekly briefing today said china always attached 
importance to the safety of the foreign embassies in china 
li said nixons fiveday visit which ended several before the 
briefing will undoubtedly be conducive to the restoration and 
development of the normal relations 
but he said it is imperative for the united states and 
actually the united states only to take the initiative in 
improving ties 
washington cut off highlevel contacts with beijing after the 
crackdown when chinese troops killed hundreds of unarmed 
civilians it has urged china to end repression against those who 
advocate democratic reform 
nixon aides said the former president will present a written 
account of his private visit to president bush

the widow of a gulf power co executive 
killed in a mysterious plane crash has filed a wrongful death 
lawsuit against a related company that owned the aircraft 
frances w horton filed the suit against southern company 
services inc on wednesday a day after gulf power pleaded guilty 
to federal charges of conspiring to make illegal political 
contributions 
gulf power officials and federal prosecutors said the 
contributions were arranged by her husband jacob jake horton 
the utilitys senior vice president 
the defendant company and gulf power are subsidiaries of the 
atlantabased southern co 
horton died april 10 in the crash that also killed two southern 
company pilots from mississippi within minutes after it took off 
from pensacola regional airport en route to atlanta 
the suit alleges that southern company and the pilots were 
negligent in maintaining and operating the aircraft 
the crashs cause officially remains under investigation but 
the national transportation safety board has determined a fire 
broke out in the cabin before the crash 
the suit alleges the fire resulted from negligent maintenance 
and operation of the airplane and directly contributed to the crash 
the pilots allegedly failed to properly respond to the fire and 
lost control of the plane causing the crash according to the suit 
federal investigators say they have reached no conclusions on 
the causes of either the fire or the crash 
no dollar amount is specified in the suit but it demands 
compensation for the mrs hortons loss of her husbands support 
services compansionship and protection funeral costs and her 
mental pain and suffering 
horton was told that a gulf power audit committee had 
recommended his dismissal just hours before the crash before 
boarding the plane horton told his lawyer that he thought he was a 
target of a federal grand jury in atlanta that was investigating 
gulf power 
gulf power also pleaded guilty to impeding the internal revenue 
service and paid a 500000 fine as part of a plea bargain the 
pleas were entered in us district court in atlanta 
utility officials and federal prosecutors said that horton 
orchestrated the scheme in which gulf power vendors would make 
contributions to politicians and submit phony invoices to the 
utility to obtain the money 
however an attorney who previously represented gulf power 
accused the utility and the federal government of using horton as a 
scapegoat 
fred levin a lawyer in pensacola said the plea agreement was a 
gutless move designed to justify a costly federal investigation and 
to draw attention from the utility onto the deceased executive 
theres no question he horton is taking the blame levin 
said he has no choice because he cant talk back 
carter haynes a gulf power spokesman expressed surprise at 
levins reaction and us attorney robert l barr jr of atlanta 
said horton was not being blamed unjustly saying the government 
had a substantial amount of evidence against him

an eightyear study that followed more than 
13000 people shows that physical activity significantly reduces 
the risk of death from virtually all causes including heart 
disease and cancer researchers say 
while the risk of death was lowest among those who were the most 
active the studys authors say that even a slight increase in 
activity may reduce death rates among the least fit 
moderate levels of physical fitness that are attainable by 
most adults appear to be protective against early mortality say 
the authors of the study to be published in fridays journal of 
the american medical association 
the study by steven n blair and others at the institute for 
aerobics research in dallas indicated that if all the unfit people 
surveyed had taken measures to become fit death rates would have 
been reduced by 9 percent in men and 153 percent in women 
the researchers studied 10224 men and 3120 women for an 
average of more than eight years of those 240 men and 43 women 
died during the study 
the subjects were first tested on a treadmill to determine their 
fitness level and then tested for cholesterol blood pressure and 
other general health factors they also were questioned about 
relevant lifestyle factors such as smoking as well as family 
history of heart disease 
even when all other data were factored in the more active 
groups had lower death rates the authors said 
among men who were the least fit the death rate was 64 per 
10000 personyears compared with 166 deaths among the most fit 
group a personyear equals the number of people studied multiplied 
by the number of years they were followed 
among women deaths dropped from 395 per 10000 personyears to 
85 per 10000 
heartdisease death rates among men fell from 246 among the 
least fit to 31 for those in the two most fit groups for women 
heartdisease death rates dropped from 74 to 08 
death rates from cancer among men fell from 203 to 47 and 
among women dropped from 163 to 10 
approximately 30 percent of us adults are quite sedentary 
and the prevalence of low fitness levels is correspondingly high 
the authors wrote a brisk walk of 30 to 60 minutes each day will 
be sufficient to achieve fitness and reduce the risk of death 
from heart disease and cancer 
an accompanying editorial by dr jeffrey koplan and others at 
the federal centers for disease control in atlanta urged schools 
and doctors to encourage americans to become more active 
increased physical activity leads to improved physical fitness 
and to other physiological changes he wrote it is the 
combination of these changes that leads to improved health

authorities said they arrested the 
leader of a ring that smuggled 60 tons of cocaine into the united 
states during the past year including a record 21 tons seized near 
los angeles 
at least 50 federal police officers stormed a downtown motel 
wednesday and arrested rafael munoz talavera but a halfhour after 
later his attorneys served federal officials with a court order 
restraining police action against their client 
federal prosecutor rolando aguilera said the order required that 
authorities release munoz who lives in this border city by this 
afternoon unless he is formally charged with a crime 
on sept 28 us officials seized 214 tons of cocaine at a 
suburban los angeles warehouse in what authorities called the 
worlds largest cocaine seizure ever officials also raided six 
warehouses in el paso texas believed to have been a staging area 
for the cocaine 
six men have been arrested in the united states in connection 
with the case and all have pleaded innocent to drug charges one of 
the six identified munoz as the mastermind of the smuggling 
operation authorities said 
munoz had been hiding out three days at motel colonial las 
fuentes federal police said 
according to the court order the suspects relatives claim that 
juarez police were about to fly munoz to mexico city for 
prosecution 
the order blocked such action aguilera said 
earlier this week mexican officials seized restaurant florida 
a popular restaurant in ciudad juarez owned by munoz

sid caesar amp company does anybody know what 
im talking about a broadway revue starring the legendary 
television comedian is mostly caesar but not much company 
the show is a collection of hitandmiss sketches that look and 
sound as if they would play better on a 10inch philco than at the 
golden theater which is where the revue opened wednesday night 
the skits uncredited in the program are designed to show off 
caesars unique talent at mime mimicry and general comic lunacy 
occasionally they succeed 
its fun to watch caesar portray a gum machine that evolves into 
a slot machine and eventually is demoted to a towel machine in a 
mens room he also does a pretty fair impersonation of a baby 
complete with whines tantrums coos and burps 
hes dandy at playing a mortally wounded jewish matador in a 
scene reminiscent of his big dying number goodbye in the 
musical little me but there is no overall form to the evening 
at the beginning of the show caesar looking remarkably relaxed 
and fit announces that his favorite type of comedy is rooted in 
truth the truths that follow meander from obvious jokes about 
a mans thoughts as he walks down the aisle on his wedding day to 
an overlong argument between husband and wife mimed to the first 
movement of beethovens fifth symphony 
caesar also resurrects his german professor who spritzes the 
audience with double talk and a variety of accents dialects and 
languages he plays the same love scene in german italian and 
japanese and the results are equally hilarious 
the large supporting cast seven players in all has little to 
do except occupy the stage during caesars brief costume changes 
director martin charnin injects a little fizz into their interludes 
by giving them some peppy but nondescript revue tunes to cover up 
caesars brief absences 
the production designs by neil peter jampolis are meager and 
unnecessary looking as if they were an afterthought added only to 
spruce up the show for its move to broadway after a run of several 
months at a greenwich village nightclub 
caesar has not had much luck on broadway during his long career 
little me was a wonderful show with a terrific score by cy 
coleman and carolyn leigh but it ran only about six months his 
last appearance on broadway was in the flop comedy four on a 
garden in 1971 the man has always been better than his material 
you are better off renting a videotape of ten from your show 
of shows a collection of his best television sketches with 
imogene coca carl reiner and howard morris on broadway the 
mighty caesar is again in a mouse of a show 
in other reviews critics generally praised caesar but rejected 
the shows length and attempt at being a review 
the new york times frank rich said caesar was in fine form but 
there was good reason to worry about his show for it is so 
misconceived that it turns the guest of honor into a beggar at his 
own feast 
leo seligsohn of new york newsday said although the show makes 
for and uneven evening when its good its very very good 
don nelson of the daily news called the show uneven and 
despite a solid supporting cast disappointing the new york 
posts clive barnes was more charitable saying caesar is a 
clowning genius who could have used better material

jessica mcclure the toddler pulled from an 
abandoned well two years ago as the nation watched rescuers 
struggle for 58 hours is now 3 years old and capable of stealing 
the spotlight from even president bush 
bush scooped the midland texas girl into his arms wednesday 
during a white house ceremony honoring sioux city iowa for its 
response to the crash of a united airlines jumbo jet last july 19 
jessica grabbed bushs glasses off his face and faced the 
clicking cameras with them balanced on her nose 
even as he walked into the roosevelt room to present the midland 
community spirit award to sioux city jessica did not appear 
impressed 
whos that mama asked the blueeyed girl in a red corduroy 
smock with winnie the pooh on the front tossing her ponytail 
later as she returned his glasses to bushs breast pocket 
jessica discovered the presidents white handkerchief 
this may make that what do you call it the blooper of the 
week said the president after jessica tried to drape the 
handkerchief over his head and dabbed his nose 
im sorry about that you can go to your mother he said 
laughing and handing the wriggling girl to her mother 20yearold 
reba cissy mcclure 
after paying tribute to sioux city as an example of his 
thousand points of lights volunteerism bush said thank you 
all and as for you jessica wheres my handkerchief 
and as the audience howled bush asked how old are you now 
she held up three fingers 
cmon jessica you want to see where i work bush said and 
the two with her parents trailing behind bounded off to the oval 
office 
mrs mcclure said the oct 16 1987 rescue of her daughter who 
was 18 months old at the time was similar to the rescue of 
passengers trapped inside flight 232 
everybody pulled together to save the people she said 
there were people trapped in that plane and couldnt get out 
mothers and fathers and children and they couldnt find them and 
thats exactly how i felt i was running through the back yard 
looking for my child and i couldnt find her 
mayor carroll thomas said the midland community spirit award 
would be given annually to recognize the community that best 
exemplifies volunteerism and compassion and concern for their 
fellow citizens 
there were 85 entries for the award with the words nothing

government troops have been ordered to 
shoot on sight anyone carrying arms in areas being vacated by 
indian peacekeeping troops the foreign minister said today 
young tamils armed with ak47 assault rifles and wearing 
militarystyle uniforms have been seen in such areas 
indian troops who are scheduled to leave sri lanka by the end 
of december withdrew from one such area the east coasts ampara 
district last week 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne spoke to reporters at a weekly 
cabinet briefing where he was asked whether a tamil national 
army had been armed and trained by the departing indian soldiers 
we do not believe this tamil army exists but if they do they 
are strongly advised to surrender their arms to law enforcement 
authorities without further delay said wijeratne who is also 
deputy defense minister 
if they do not they will be destroyed by sri lankan armed 
forces and police wherever they are found he added 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the most powerful of the 
tamil militant groups in northern and eastern sri lanka issued a 
statement tuesday claiming under the pretext of defending the 
tamils and moslem people the indian government is organizing an 
army of cronies 
the tigers are engaged in a power struggle with other tamil 
groups that have been friendly with india 
a spokesman for the indian high commission or embassy denied 
indian troops had trained anyone other than a civil volunteer force 
that is supposed to help sri lankan police he spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
an associated press reporter who visited eastern sri lanka last 
week saw trucks loaded with young armed tamils heading out of 
batticaloa on the road to ampara 
local tamil militant leaders said the youths were part of a 
militia that claims 10000 recruits and is separate from the 
civilian volunteer force they said the militia was needed to 
ensure that the tamildominated provincial council is given the 
powers promised it by the central government 
indian troops were sent to northeastern sri lanka in july 1987 
to enforce a peace plan designed to end a separatist war by 
guerrillas from the tamil minority since then more than 1100 
indian soldiers have been killed in ambushes and battles with 
tamils who refused to surrender their weapons 
the sri lankan government which is dominated by the sinhalese 
majority has been trying to work out a peace agreement with the 
tamil tigers 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
are mostly hindus sinhalese account for 75 percent of the 
population and are mostly buddhists 
india got involved in the internal affairs of its small island 
neighbor through its role as the regions biggest power and the 
sympathies of its own politically powerful minority of 60 million 
tamils for their sri lankan brethren

transport secretary cecil parkinson today denied 
engaging in insider trading as rumors swept londons financial 
markets of a scandal involving a cabinet minister in the 
conservative government 
share prices tumbled in early trading but recovered later amid 
the rumors that a cabinet minister was about to quit prime minister 
margaret thatchers government because of the alleged scandal 
the jittery market reaction and the speculation that parkinson 
was involved reflected edginess about the government 
it already was shaken by last weeks resignation of chancellor 
of the exchequer nigel lawson in a policy dispute with mrs 
thatcher 
in the first hour of trading the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index fell 127 points but share prices rallied after 
parkinson denied involvement and a television network that was 
conducting the investigation said its program was not yet ready 
at 11 am 6 am edt the 100share index stood at 21571 
down 3 points or 01 percent from wednesdays close 
parkinson in a statement issued through his lawyer peter 
carterruck said there was no foundation whatsoever in the 
rumors adding he has not engaged in any insider dealing nor in 
any share dealings 
the statement said parkinson transferred his funds to 
stockbrokers when he became a cabinet minister and he has since 
played no part whatsoever in any investments his brokers made 
the rumor that he might resign as minister of transport is 
totally without foundation the statement said 
a spokeswoman at mrs thatchers downing street office said she 
had no information on the insider trading rumors involving 
parkinson 
we have no knowledge of this and we cant comment she said 
the rumors began today after the scotsman a respected daily 
based in edinburgh reported that britains channel 4 television 
network has investigated a insiderdealing group which allegedly 
has at least one senior government member among its clients 
in a statement channel 4 confirmed it is working on the 
investigation but said the program was as yet neither complete 
nor scheduled the network declined to elaborate 
the scotsman said the program claims that the secret 
sharebuying ring has been carrying out transactions on behalf of a 
number of clients some of whom may not know the precise nature of 
the dealings but who have all benefited from them 
insider trading is the illegal attempt to profit by buying and 
selling stock based on inside information about a company such as 
takeover offers or profits prospects which is not available to the 
public 
mrs thatcher reappointed parkinson to the cabinet in 1987 four 
years after he resigned when news broke that his exsecretary was 
pregnant by him the secretary sara keays who now has his 
daughter said that parkinson had reneged on promises of marriage 
he stayed with his wife

identify sent the poison pen letters in an attempt to steal her 
dancers

being overweight to being too old one letter to an 11yearold 
apprentice accused her of being disruptive 
you are upsetting my girls and causing trouble in my school 
and in the ballet company the letter said your family is also 
upsetting people you are not to return here 
marsden said a 20yearold ballerina quit after receiving a 
letter despite marsdens insistence it was phony 
about a dozen apprentices and members of marsdens 30yearold 
semiprofessional dance company received the letters postmarked in 
providence sept 4 
the nonprofit company has 50 to 60 dancers only guest artists 
and principal dancers get paid 
marsden said that she has dismissed one dancer in five years and 
that if she has a complaint company members have to face me and 
i tell them to their faces what they have to do 
but im a very easy person to live with she said

decade 
the supreme peoples court and supreme peoples prosecutors 
office announced on aug 15 that all people who turned themselves 
in to authorities for economic crimes by oct 31 would be treated 
leniently

the prodemocracy demonstrations earlier this year ending 
corruption was a popular demand among students workers and other 
residents who filled tiananmen square and the streets of beijing 
during the protests which were violently suppressed by the chinese 
army in early june 
also today the communist party said that despite weeks of 
ideological indoctrination some chinese college students still 
have knots to be untied because they believe their 
prodemocracy protests this past spring were patriotic 
commentaries in two major newspapers including the main party 
paper peoples daily also called on students and intellectuals to 
embrace socialism and the partys leadership or their aspirations 
will vanish like soap bubbles 
as part of its program to stem a resurgence of the movement on 
beijings university campuses authorities required a month of 
political study of all students before the beginning of the fall 
semester 
the bloody suppression of the protests in june by the chinese 
army left at least hundreds of unarmed civilians dead since then 
the government has insisted that the protests were misled by a 
clique of counterrevolutionaries seeking to topple the 
countrys communist leadership

the area of of beiruts dividing green line which separates moslem 
and christian forces envoy lakhdar ibrahimi was quoted as saying 
by the independent newspaper annahar 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said police will begin patrolling friday evening 
parliament speaker hussein husseini defying opposition from 
christian leader gen michel aoun summoned the 73 surviving 
legislators to three consecutive sessions saturday 
the first session will be to elect a new house speaker the

the peace plan was worked out by 63 parliamentary deputies in 23 
days of deliberations in taif saudi arabia in october 
the accord raises the 99 seats of the unicameral house to 108 
to be evenly distributed between moslems and christians increases 
the speakers term to four years and strips the president of the 
authority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers 
under the previous governing arrangement the christians held 
the edge in political power 
the plan also called for a partial syrian military withdrawal 
from moslem west beirut and its environs within two years 
the peace plan according to the constitution must ratified by 
a parliamentary session in lebanon to become legally binding but 
it also must be accepted by the militia leaders to have any effect 
aoun 54 a maronite christian rejects the plan because it does 
not include a clear timetable for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 
troops

international circles syrias moslem and leftist allies said no 
moves would be taken to obstruct its implementation

the united states has called the taif accord a positive 
development it evacuated ambassador john mccarthy and 29 other 
american diplomats from lebanon sept 6 after saying security 
around the embassy was inadequate 
aoun accuses the syrians of betraying a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the 22nation arab league by siding with moslems 
against christians in the civil war 
aoun who heads an interim christian military cabinet vying for 
power with the moslem government of acting prime minister salim 
hoss has threatened to dissolve parliament to block implementation

investigators offered three possible motives 
for the botched halloween night shooting of a son of jailed mob 
boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo revenge against the father 
or battles for power or turf 
nicodemo scarfo jr 24 was recuperating under police guard 
today at thomas jefferson university hospital after being shot by a 
masked man as he dined at an italian restaurant scarfo was knocked 
out of his chair falling face down in a pool of blood and tomato 
sauce 
dr jerome vernick director of the hospitals trauma center 
said scarfo was hit by at least four bullets in the arm behind 
the ear in the shoulder and in the chest he said scarfo was in 
fair condition 
police said he may have been shot for revenge against the 
failure of his father who headed the philadelphiasouthern new 
jersey mob for nearly a decade to keep his mafia members from 
becoming government informants 
at least five already have given the authorities information 
that has helped result in the convictions of the elder scarfo and 
about two dozen of his men on assorted charges including 
racketeering murder and extortion 
when the 60yearold scarfo was sentenced to 69 years in the 
federal penitentiary at marion ill some sources said his middle 
son nicodemo jr sought to take over his fathers gambling and 
loan sharking activities 
young scarfo known for his wraparound sunglasses and 
slickedback hair was said by acquaintances to relish his 
closeness to the mob throne 
louis pichini of the us organized crime strike force said 
there were three possibilities of why young scarfo was shot 
one is that he could have been the victim of an internal 
struggle to take over what was left of scarfos organization 
pichini said 
second he could have been the victim of outside mob forces 
from new york trying to move in and he was representative of the 
existing group here or what was left of it 
and the third possibility is that those mobsters in new york 
were upset about the number of defectors in the philadelphia 
organization and scarfos lack of control and were retaliating 
with a deadly message to show they didnt like it one bit 
a halfdozen police officers guarded scarfo in the hospital

a gynecologist accused of romancing three 
patients and getting them pregnant has been indicted on charges he 
performed or attempted abortions on them without their consent 
dr pravin d thakkar 38 of frankton who also faces several 
lawsuits professional ethics charges and federal financial charges 
surrendered wednesday pleaded innocent and was freed on 100000 
bail 
defense attorney jeffrey a lockwood said of the indictment i 
havent read these but i listened to the judge read them and im 
at a loss to find anything thats new in all of this 
thakkar was indicted on charges including two counts of 
performing illegal abortions and one of attempting to perform an 
illegal abortion he could receive up to 42 years in prison if 
convicted on all counts said prosecutor william lawler jr 
cathy d collins and carmen brutchen hertzinger of anderson had 
accused thakar of impregnating them and performing abortions on 
them without their consent in 1988 and 1983 respectively 
prosecutors said he also got bonnie coffeymyers of indianapolis 
pregnant and administered an injection intended to induce an 
abortion in 1987 she aborted six days later 
thakkar was charged with attempting an abortion in that case 
i think justice is being served said ms coffeymyers if 
anything im disappointed that more counts couldnt have been 
handed down but im hoping what was handed down was enough to put 
him away for a while 
allegations against thakkar a native of india who set up his 
medical practice at frankton in 1981 became public in february 
when collins and hertzinger sued 
that same month nearly a dozen former patients went before the 
state medical licensing board with allegations of sexual misconduct 
and abuse the board has suspended his license 
thakkar goes on trial monday on charges he violated financial 
reporting requirements by withdrawing more than 132000 from bank 
accounts in chunks of just under 10000 
transactions of 10000 or more must be reported by financial 
institutions to the irs

a palestinian journalist who works for the new 
york times and the cbs television network said today that the army 
raided his home and later tried to intimidate arabs who work with 
him 
an army spokesman confirmed that troops raided the gaza city 
home of taher shriteh on monday and seized material for a military 
investigation in addition to the american news media shriteh also 
works for the londonbased reuters news agency 
the spokesman who cannot be named under military rules said 
the raid was conducted because prior information supports the 
suspicion that he may be involved in incitement or support of 
violent disturbances 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip have been rocked by a 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule for the past 22 months 
the army closely monitors and censors palestinian newspapers 
and has raided palestinian press offices and the homes and offices 
of several arab journalists including one who works for the 
associated press 
shriteh said that on monday seven soldiers broke into his house 
and searched his office and bedroom the material they confiscated 
included reports he submitted to reuters his telephone directory 
and five videotapes 
he said three of the videotapes were of demonstrations he filmed 
for cbs one was a movie and one was a tape of his 1987 wedding 
shriteh said an officer working with the military administration 
in gaza capt yaacov sabagh later called three people named in 
shritehs phone directory and told them to stop supplying him with 
information 
they are trying to limit my work and scare people from helping 
me shriteh said 
an army spokesman refused to confirm or deny if the army called 
arabs named in shritehs book but said we are checking that 
there will be no unauthorized use of the material taken 
shriteh said the book was returned thursday along with about 
half of his files 
what they did is a clear violation of my rights as a 
journalist he said if they think that reporting the news 
incites riots then all of the foreign press is guilty of 
incitement

deadly earthquake jolted northern california but the only harm 
appeared to be more jangled nerves authorities said today 
the aftershock which struck at 950 pm wednesday and measured

epicenter of the oct 17 quake said pat jorgenson spokeswoman for 
the us geological survey in menlo park 
it was the 84th aftershock of at least magnitude30 and the

franciscos marina district which was devastated last month 
just bricks falling said officer gordon clark people 
have been calling in sheer panic saying the big one is on the 
way we try to console them and tell them its an aftershock

vital transportation links help displaced people rebuild their 
lives and figure out how to pay for billions of dollars in damage 
the legislature was scheduled to begin a special session in 
sacramento today to decide whether to raise the state sales tax by

a plan to use mobile homes to temporarily house residents displaced 
by the quake late wednesday ordered 100 mobile homes sent to the 
watsonville area 
the agency said in a statement that the need for the mobile 
homes in santa cruz county where many poor people were left 
homeless is a close call it did not explain why it reversed 
its position 
the county had requested about 500 mobile homes saying existing 
vacancies cannot absorb the thousands whose homes were destroyed or 
seriously damaged fema has about 2300 mobile homes on hand for 
victims of disasters 
providing shelter has brought the red cross face to face with a 
new problem coping with chronically homeless people along with 
those who lost their homes to the earthquake 
sixty percent of the 160 people still sleeping and eating at a 
red cross shelter in the marina district were among the chronic 
homeless red cross spokeswoman chris garrett said wednesday 
this is a new phenomenon for the red cross she said 
traditionally we have three phases of disaster relief giving 
emergency help sheltering people and getting people back into 
their homes now were finding that people who didnt have homes 
suddenly have homes with us and no place to go 
mayor art agnos responding to reports he was angry about red 
cross suggestions that those who were homeless before the quake 
were the citys problem said he understood the organizations 
difficulties he denied he was unhappy with the red cross

hundreds packed the city council chambers to 
demand the resignation of a member who made a racial slur about the 
late us rep mickey leland 
houston does not need a racist to represent our city said 
joann gavin one of 39 speakers who raised the issue wednesday 
racism is not negotiable 
the councilman jim westmoreland listened intently during the 
threehour barrage leaving once to get a cup of coffee and later 
told reporters he would not resign 
westmoreland had suggested to a reporter oct 18 that houston 
intercontinental airport be renamed nigger international to 
appease council members pushing to rename the airport for leland 
the congressman was killed in a plane crash in august while aiding 
famine victims in africa 
westmoreland a 16year councilman seeking reelection to his 
atlarge seat next week has apologized for the comment while 
claiming he actually said negro international in joking about 
the airport renaming 
he also suggested during the interview that the white crosses 
erected at the site of fatal traffic accidents caused by drunken 
drivers be painted black to appease black citizens as well as those 
against drunken driving 
speakers who appeared during the regular city council session 
werent laughing 
we tell a joke and our friends hear it skipper lee told 
westmoreland you tell a joke and the next day its on the 
streets of new york city you dont just speak for yourself you 
speak for houston we look up to you and we cant look up to a 
racist 
westmoreland said the matter has overshadowed other campaign 
issues and prompted threats against him and his family 
any anguish this has caused anyone could not match the anguish 
ive suffered and my family he said im truly sorry for my 
comments 
he told reporters the question of resignation is one i dont 
think we have to make because we have a vote coming up with all 
the publicity this has generated theres no one going to the polls

the warden of the state prison where 123 
people were hurt during two nights of riots was suspended after 
guards charged officials did nothing about broken cell locks before 
the second night of upheaval 
corrections commissioner david s owens jr suspended robert 
freeman the prisons superintendent on wednesday but owens said 
he will not publicly disclose or confirm the alleged facts in 
order to preserve superintendent freemans due process rights and 
to maintain the integrity of the ongoing investigation 
the suspension was announced two hours after the associated 
press reported that guards said inmates could go on a second 
rampage because officials failed to fix broken control boxes after 
the first night of riots 
more than 15 correctional officers told ap the prison 
administration was alerted but ignored the problem 
several guards at the state correctional institution at camp 
hill also said officials lied about what time they had secured the 
prison after the first night of riots oct 25 they added that the 
administration ignored guards reports that some inmates were 
telling them a riot was planned 
corrections department spokeswoman sherri cadeaux maintained 
wednesday that the mediumsecurity prison was under control when 
officials said it was at 10 pm the guards contended some inmates 
were still loose hours after that 
another department spokesman kenneth robinson would not say 
whether the information revealed in wednesdays ap story had any 
bearing on freemans suspension 
freeman has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached 
for comment at the prison wednesday night 
the fiery rioting left more than a dozen buildings destroyed 
thirteen prison staffers were held hostage at various points during 
the two riots 
sgt richard gavin said he pointed out the broken lock control 
panels to officials early in the morning before the second riot 
he said he asked his supervisor for 43 locks to secure the inmates 
in his area and received 19 
the control panels known as lock switch or rod boxes are 10 
to 12 feet long and run the length of each tier above the cells 
guards said 
during the first round of rioting inmates removed metal covers 
over the boxes the guards said on the second night inmates 
reached out of their cells and released a 2inch lever in each box 
to free themselves 
gavin said he showed several officials inmates could reach up 
and release the lever 
thats what we kept complaining about gavin said it 
would really blow you away if you were inside and i could show you 
how simple it was 
at 10 am oct 26 gavin said he was told to go home because 
i was not needed he said the remaining locks had not arrived 
the second riot started that night at 7 pm when prisoners got 
out of their cells as the evening meal was served officials didnt 
regain control until after 9 am friday 
james e kraft a guard with 13 years experience said the 
prison was not secured for one second 
all they inmates had to do was reach out of those doors and 
pop a switch kraft said 
some guards said they filed reports two weeks before the riot 
quoting inmates who had warned about the coming trouble 
prison spokesman john a palakovich said he could not comment on 
the allegations because the investigation is pending 
during the first night of rioting the administration said the 
prison was secured at 10 pm oct 25 
they lied gavin said i was personally there until they 
escorted inmates into the blocks until 2 in the morning 
palakovich stood by the official statement that the institution 
was secured at 10 pm 
ms cadeaux the prison spokeswoman said prison officials made 
clear at the time that inmates were still being escorted to their 
cells but she stressed that officials were in control at 10 pm 
kraft said neither the inmates nor their cells were thoroughly 
searched after the first riot other guards backed up his story 
when the riots first broke out the prison located 5 miles west 
of harrisburg was nearly 45 percent over capacity with 2600 
inmates in a 52acre complex intended for 1820

many deaths could be prevented if the bush 
administration would require schools to put better mirrors on their 
buses some house members said today 
school children at an alarming rate are being killed by their 
own school buses said rep dennis eckart dohio chief sponsor 
of a bill that would order the federal government to update its 
safety standards for school buses 
eckart wants the government to require special mirrors that 
eliminate driver blind spots that can leave children vulnerable 
to being hit by buses 
jeffrey miller acting administrator of the national highway 
traffic safety administration told the hearing the agency has 
begun working on new rules for school bus mirrors and swingout 
stop sign attachments therefore we believe that legislation 
of this type is unneccessary he said 
miller also told the panel the agency objects to the 180day 
deadline proposed in eckarts bill arbitrary rulemaking 
deadlines could interfere with our ability to complete the careful 
analysis needed to assure maximum safety benefit he said 
a member of the national pta board urged the panel to support 
eckarts bill saying her meetings with the nhtsa left her 
convinced the agency didnt consider the issue a top priority 
nhtsas attitude was one of a big yawn insensitive and 
apathetic said millie waterman of mentor ohio 
today were going to wake nhtsa up promised rep thomas 
luken dohio chairman of the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials 
were going to find out why nhtsa is callously stalling on 
updating its mandatory safety standard for school bus mirrors while 
children are continuously being killed and injured throughout the 
country he said 
miller told a cbstv interviewer school busrelated fatalities 
shouldnt be considered a big problem area 
when you look at the whole range of traffic crashes you find 
roughly 40 or so schoolage pedestrian fatalities associated 
with school buses every year miller said you find several 
thousand fatalities of schoolage children in other kinds of 
traffic crashes 
mrs watermans husband harry told lukens subcommittee that 
when he was in charge of transportation for mentors public schools 
he installed stateoftheart mirrors for about 100 a bus that 
erased driver blind spots 
the mirrors make the area in front of the bus and underneath the 
front bumper visible to the drivers 
each year an average of 26 children are killed and 470 children 
are injured after being struck by a school bus according to a 
report issued in may by a research arm of the national academy of 
sciences

hundreds of people protesting the 
trials of 15 albanian separatists battled police in the troubled 
province of kosovo and one protester was killed sources and the 
official tanjug news agency said today 
the demonstrator identified as bedri sokolji was shot dead 
during a protest by about 1000 people in the provinces capital of 
pristina late wednesday night tanjug said 
several smaller groups of demonstrators fought running battles 
with police today in different kosovo towns to protest the trial of 
azem vlasi a popular former provincial communist party chief and 
14 other ethnic albanians sources told the associated press on 
condition of anonymity 
the defendants are charged with engaging in 
counterrevolutionary activities and opposing constitutional 
changes that limited the provinces autonomy 
death is the maximum penalty on conviction of the charges which 
include inciting ethnic albanians to riot and strike vlasis 
codefendants are officials and workers at a zinc and lead mine 
where a strike occurred in march 
shots were heard today in the pristina district of suncani breg 
where security forces used tear gas and firearms to quell a 
demonstration by an unspecified number of ethnic albanians the 
sources said 
four people barricaded themselves in a public building in 
suncani breg shooting at the police which have surrounded the 
area tanjug said 
a real war is going on out there said a source in a 
telephone interview he said the area was sealed off by heavy 
police forces and armored vehicles 
on monday police used tear gas and clubs to disperse a similar 
demonstration of about 1000 people the same day the trial was 
adjourned soon after it opened as defense lawyers asked for a 
change of venue the lawyers said a fair trial is impossible in 
serbia because none of its courts could be considered impartial 
kosovo with a predominantly ethnic albanian population is a 
province in the republic of serbia for generations the serbs and 
ethnic albanians have accused each other of discrimination 
vlasi 42 on monday described the proceedings as a show trial 
and claimed he was the victim of a plot by archrival slobodan 
milosevic president of serbia 
until his arrest in march vlasi publicly opposed milosevics 
efforts to increase control over kosovo an autonomous province in 
which 85 percent of the 19 million people are ethnic albanians at 
least 24 people were killed in the march violence 
milosevic and the serbian leadership argued the changes were 
necessary because of alleged harassment of the serbian minority in 
kosovo the heartland of ancient serbia 
the trial has been denounced in the liberal yugoslav republics 
of slovenia and in croatia as a serbian bid to intimidate ethnic 
albanian dissent in kosovo

ford motor co today made a friendly offer of 25 
billion in cash for the struggling british luxury carmaker jaguar 
plc and general motors corp said it would not try to outbid its 
us competitor 
jaguar which had negotiated with general motors to fend off 
unwanted advances from ford recommended that its shareholders 
accept fords offer of 850 pence or 1335 a share shareholders 
must approve the deal by a 75 percent majority 
gm spokesman tony spalding said in london later today that his 
company would not bid for jaguar shares 
the worlds biggest automaker gm had us regulatory approval 
to buy up to 15 percent of jaguar but on wednesday gm chairman 
roger b smith said he didnt expect a bidding war to erupt with 
ford 
ford and gm were looking at jaguar to add prestige to their 
lineups and a manufacturing plant in england auto analysts have 
said some also have said that a usbacked jaguar could offer 
competition in the growing luxury car market to the this falls 
toyota lexus and nissan infiniti lines 
jaguar had been expected to become the target in a 
multibilliondollar bidding war between gm and ford after the 
british government announced tuesday that it was prepared to waive 
its golden share which allows jaguar to veto any takeover 
jaguar which has suffered from a slump in the us sales it 
depends heavily upon had been looking for a partner to give it 
financial and technological support while remaining independent 
the offer from ford which already controls 132 percent of 
jaguar was lower than jaguars closing share price 1380 
wednesday 
it looks like jaguar have settled for the best they could 
get said john lawson auto industry analyst at the nomura 
research institute in london i dont see a higher counter offer 
emerging 
said peter deighton an analyst with brokerage county natwest 
woodmac to suddenly find that the management of jaguar is 
endorsing the bid from ford and recommending it suggests that gm 
have said theyre not prepared to go this far 
analysts had said that jaguar could fetch 28 billion if ford 
and gm put competing bids on the table 
in a joint statement ford and jaguar said the deal represented 
an important step toward helping ford develop a presence in the 
worldwide luxury car market 
under the deal jaguar said it would remain a separate legal 
entity with a selfsustaining capital structure 
jaguars board would also operate independently made up of 
senior jaguar management and directors nominated by ford jaguar 
would report to the chairman of ford of europe 
ford and jaguar said they believed there was considerable 
potential to increase sales by expanding jaguars product range in 
europe the united states and elsewhere 
ford would inject funds into jaguar to develop the companys 
existing product range and boost its research and development 
funding in addition jaguar would be able to make use of fords 
worldwide engineering purchasing and manufacturing technologies 
gms friendly talks with jaguar in recent weeks had been 
expected to result in a deal by midnovember under which general 
motors would have acquired a stake of perhaps 30 percent 
the pursuit for jaguar became public on sept 19 when ford 
announced it would buy up to 15 percent of the carmaker 
after obtaining us regulatory approval ford said it was 
prepared to mount a full bid for jaguar once takeover restrictions 
were dropped 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said this week that if 75 
percent of jaguar shareholders vote to lift a 15 percent 
restriction on holdings in jaguar the government would drop its 
special share 
the golden share and the 15 percent limit were due to expire at 
the end of 1990

about 8000 east germans swarmed into 
czechoslovakia after east berlin lifted a travel ban and many 
reached the west german embassy in prague seeking to follow 
thousands of countrymen to the west 
the resumption of what has been a historic exodus came as east 
germanys new communist leader egon krenz arrived in warsaw today 
for meetings with polands communist party leaders and the new 
solidarity prime minister 
krenz said it was a great pleasure for him to meet prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki the east blocs first noncommunist 
head of government the two men shook hands warmly for the benefit 
of photographers 
i hope we will have not only good neighborly relations but 
friendship as well krenz said we have had good traditions and 
i think we can continue those 
proreform demonstrations continued across east germany on 
wednesday the staterun adn news agency said 20000 people marched 
in neubrandenburg and tens of thousands protested in 
frankfurtontheoder 
the demonstrators have been urging reforms that include free 
elections a multiparty political system and an end to press 
censorship 
in an interview with west germanys saarland radio an 
opposition leader challenged the communist partys leading role in 
east german society 
if the party does not give up this claim there will be no 
democratization no revival of the economy no solution to the many 
problems said ehrhard neubert a leader of the opposition group 
democratic awakening 
but a member of the largest opposition group new forum said in 
an east german newspaper interview that for his group the removal 
of the communist party was not part of the debate 
restrictions on travel to czechoslovakia were imposed oct 3 by 
erich honecker whom krenz has since replaced in an attempt to 
thwart an exodus of young skilled workers fed up with decades of 
rigid communist rule 
krenz rescinded the ban as he began steering east germany on 
what he termed a new course of tolerance and openness that has 
included dialogue with the leading banned opposition group new 
forum 
more than 70000 east germans have fled to west germany since 
august through hungary or after seeking refuge in west german 
embassies in warsaw and prague 
adn said at least 8000 east germans crossed the border into 
czechoslovakia as east german authorities renewed visafree travel 
to the neighboring country west germanys zdf television network 
said this morning that nearly 1000 east germans had massed at 
bonns embassy in prague zdf added that more than 1000 east 
germans were still in warsaw waiting for passage to west 
krenz has said he wants political and economic changes but has 
not indicated how far he is willing to go he has however 
announced an amnesty for people who fled to the west illegally or 
were caught trying to escape 
additionally a prominent east german lawyer reportedly said 
wednesday that the government has begun freeing some political 
prisoners 
after meeting in moscow with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev krenz said east germany would follow gorbachevs path of 
reform he told reporters that the two had reached total 
agreement on all questions we discussed one of which was reform 
in both of their countries 
the west german newspaper die welt quoted east german government 
attorney wolfgang vogel as saying his country already has begun 
freeing political prisoners after pledging amnesty last week 
vogel said the released prisoners could choose to stay in east 
germany or apply for emigration to the west die welt reported 
he also reportedly said the west german practice of paying east 
germany for the release of political prisoners has ended 
west german newspapers estimate that over the past 25 years the 
bonn government has paid 13 billion to east germany to ensure the 
release of about 30000 political prisoners to the west 
we hope that there will be no new convictions based on 
political grounds the newspaper quoted vogel as saying 
according to west german estimates there are about 1800 
political prisoners in east german jails

south african allegations that black 
nationalist guerrillas have crossed into northern namibia a week 
before preindependence elections are based on phony radio 
messages a un spokesman said today 
foreign minister pik botha of south africa said wednesday his 
country had placed its troops on alert and was prepared to delay 
the nov 711 balloting because of the alleged incursion from 
angola 
botha said un soldiers reported in internal radio traffic the 
infiltration of 600 guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples 
organization over six days ending tuesday 
we believe the messages are phony in content and format 
un spokesman fred eckhard told a news conference 
he said un communications experts and military personnel 
examined the information provided by south african officials and 
determined the messages do not emanate from any united nations 
source 
eckhard declined to comment when asked whether the un believed 
the south africans fabricated the radio messages or if it was part 
of a hoax by another party 
northern namibia was exceptionally calm today eckhard said 
un soldiers and territorial police were conducting regular 
patrols along the namibiaangola border and had not reported any 
evidence of an incursion 
the united nations has 4650 soldiers in namibia monitoring the 
territorys transition to independence from south africa 
swapos secretary for information hidipo hamutanya today 
rejected bothas claims saying the whole thing is a smokescreen 
by south africa to influence the outcome of the elections 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia today said the south african 
troop alert nearly plunged southern africa into catastrophe and 
that south africa feared a guerrilla victory at the polls 
they want to forestall that victory kaunda told a news 
conference in the zambian capital lusaka they want to throw the 
whole region into turmoil 
kaunda chairman of the sixnation frontline states bloc in 
confrontation with south africa said swapo president sam nujoma 
assured him there was no preelection buildup of guerrillas 
martti ahtisaari the head of the un contingent said 
wednesday night the allegations of a swapo incursion were being 
forwarded to a military monitoring commission made up of south 
africans angolans and cubans who meet daily in the northern town 
of oshakati 
the three countries signed a treaty last year under which south 
africa agreed to grant independence to namibia which it has ruled 
for 74 years 
swapo which waged a 23year bush war against south african 
rule denied any of its guerrillas were crossing into namibia the 
organization is favored to get the most votes in next weeks 
balloting for seats in an assembly that will draft a constitution 
just 75000 of the territorys 13 million people are white 
under a un plan swapo is not supposed to have armed forces in 
the territory during the transition south africa has withdrawn its 
troops and law enforcement is being carried out by the integrated 
territorial police 
botha said wednesday of the alleged incursion unless this is 
resolved within days the south african government is reserving the 
right to take whatever steps would be required to ensure that all 
parties comply with their obligations 
hamutenya said swapo still had 300 guerrillas in angola but 
they were far north of the border and in compliance with all 
international agreements 
the chief of the south african defense force gen jannie 
geldenhuys said wednesday that thousands of swapo guerrillas were 
violating agreements by being in southern angola within 120 miles 
of the namibian border 
he made no mention of guerrillas infiltrating namibia 
on april 1 the official starting day of the transitional 
period south africa announced that hundreds of swapo guerrillas 
had crossed into namibia from angola in violation of international 
agreements 
about 280 guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces were 
killed in subsequent fighting according to south africa which 
received un permission to deploy its troops against swapo 
botha warned wednesday that if the alleged incursion does not 
end there cannot be a free and fair election that must be 
obvious 
botha said he met wednesday with ambassadors of the united 
states britain canada west germany france and other countries 
urging them to do what they can to end this now 
he said he had been in contact with ahtisaari and un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar but declined to say what 
they told him 
the treaty that paved the way for namibias independence also 
calls for cuba to remove its 50000 soldiers from marxistruled 
angola cuba announced earlier this week that 25000 of the troops

states upstream and downstream on the 
droughtlowered missouri river are arguing over how to control the 
precious water flow 
the concerns about dwindling water levels in the rivers six 
reservoirs drew about 80 people from nebraska kansas missouri 
colorado iowa north dakota and south dakota at a us army corps 
of engineers hearing wednesday 
storage in the reservoirs is at its lowest level since the 
system was filled in 1967 
upstream officials urged that the rivers navigation season be 
shortened by two to three months to boost upstream flows hit hard 
by three years of drought but barge operators who operate 
downstream oppose any further shortening of the season 
we cannot continue to operate as if the drought doesnt 
exist said tim edman special assistant to south dakota gov 
george mickelson in calling for a threemonth delay in opening 
navigation we are not opposed to navigation 
the corps shortened the season by three weeks in 1988 and by 
five weeks in 1989 the season begins and ends at different times 
at different ports this year it opened in midapril and ended 
oct 25 in omaha and wednesday at st louis 
edman recommended during the meeting wednesday that navigators 
haul more tonnage during a shorter season in 1987 about 23 
million tons were shipped during a sevenmonth threeweek season 
don huffman of phoenix towing in st louis said the lower river 
levels have forced him to reduce the number of barges he can tow 
and the tonnage of cargo on each barge amounting to a 45 percent 
loss of efficiency 
weve been very drastically affected by this drought this has 
cost us a lot of money he said further season cuts will raise 
shipping costs and hurt the farm economy he added 
the oneday meeting is part of the process the corps uses to 
develop its annual operating plan for the missouri river the plan 
due out in january includes an overview of what happened in 1989 
and how the corps will operate in 1990

a soviet submarine became ensnared in the 
net of a norwegian fishing trawler today but was freed when a 
stormy sea tore open the net a defense official said 
navy capt stig morten karlsen of the norwegian supreme defense 
command said neither vessel had been in danger 
darkness and the storm in the barents sea made it impossible for 
the crews to go on deck to free the 2000ton conventional 
submarine and the crews had expected to spend a rough night 
entangled together 
but the force of the storm did the job for them tearing the 
fishing net to pieces under the weight of the submarine neither 
ship suffered serious damage said major geir anda of the 
norwegian northern defense command 
karlsen said the vessels were in international waters about 57 
miles northeast of the town of vardoe on norways northern coast 
the soviet foxtrotclass submarine which carries a crew of 75 
was submerged on a routine patrol from a soviet base at murmansk 
when it got snared in the nets of the trawler to senior karlsen 
said 
the submarine put up no fight and surfaced at once cooperating 
with the fishermen 
its totally different than the last time said karlsen on 
aug 13 another entangled soviet submarine dragged a fishing boat 
backwards cut free and fled without identifying itself

us and soviet officials are jockeying over 
expectations for next months summit between president bush and 
mikhail s gorbachev debating whether it will be merely a lowkey 
meeting or a milestone in superpower relations 
planning for the dec 23 summit took a leap forward wednesday 
with the announcement that the talks will be held in the 
mediterranean on ships off the coast of malta 
an independent republic consisting of five islands malta lies 
58 miles south of sicily 220 miles north of libya and 180 miles 
east of tunisia 
for years malta had strong ties to libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi who stands accused by the united states of being the 
paymaster for bloody acts of terrorism around the globe 
but over the past two years maltas government has taken a sharp 
turn and welcomed us investment 
asked today if the white house was concerned over security 
because libyans have free access to malta press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said there always are security problems but we 
believe they can be managed he said it was the united states 
that suggested malta as the staging site 
fitzwater said bush would be greeted briefly by maltese leaders 
on his arrival dec 1 and then spend the remainder of the trip 
aboard a us navy ship rather than be based on land 
with the staging area fixed the white house said planning was 
under way on the substance of ideas and issues that bush will raise 
with gorbachev 
the soviets moved quickly to raise the stakes 
i think that this meeting can just be the end of the cold 
war said soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov the cold war will 
be dumped down to the bottom of the mediterranean sea 
gerasimovs dramatic prediction stood in stark contrast to 
bushs portrayal of the talks as a relaxed opportunity for a 
getacquainted session with no expectation of any agreements 
i dont think we expect substantive results said a us 
official 
the official speaking only on condition of anonymity said bush 
and gorbachev were expected only to make sure we have good lines 
of communication it is not an area ripe for agreements 
in keeping with us efforts to play down the meeting fitzwater 
beat a hasty retreat after referring to the talks as a summit 
let me retract the s word fitzwater laughingly told 
reporters lets call this the meeting the big m 
he said the whole trip including flying back and forth to the 
talks would not involve more than three days away from washington 
the principal subject for discussion is expected to be 
gorbachevs effort to boost the faltering soviet economy through a 
reconstruction program known as perestroika 
it is spilling over into the political arena encouraging 
political reform at home and in eastern europe and challenging the 
marxist system and the cohesion of the sovietled warsaw pact 
while gorbachev is expected to describe his problems in length 
to bush officials said moscow has given no indication through 
diplomatic channels that the soviet leader would ask for specific 
technical or other us help 
asking for direct help would not be suitable one official 
said its one thing to talk about your problems its another to 
appear to be relying on the united states for help the soviets are 
strongly independent about this

authorities are weighing whether 
to prosecute people who participated in a rally honoring freed 
leaders of the african national congress president fw de klerk 
said today 
de klerk said that during sundays rally there were apparent 
contraventions of the internal security act which makes it a 
crime to promote the aims of an outlawed organization 
he said police were preparing a dossier for the attorney general 
so he can decide whether to prosecute de klerk did not say when 
the police investigation would be completed 
seven african national congress leaders were freed 
unconditionally on oct 15 but their guerrilla movement remains 
outlawed 
speakers at the rally including four of the freed guerrilla 
leaders endorsed the movements use of violence and some quoted 
exiled anc officials both violations of security laws 
more than 70000 people attended the rally at a soccer stadium 
outside johannesburg 
de klerk in a speech to a military parade said his government 
would not lift the ban on the congress as long as it remained 
committed to violence 
regarding the freed prisoners he said they must guard 
against being misused by those seeking continued confrontation 
they would also be wise to steer away from imflammatory rhetoric 
however de klerk said further major political changes were 
needed to resolve south africas racial conflict he gave no 
specifics today but has said previously that additional steps 
under consideration include lifting of the state of emergency and 
release of nelson mandela the bestknown african national congress 
leader who remains in prison 
mandela is widely expected to be freed within the next few 
months justice ministry spokesman dirk de villiers described as 
just speculation a report today that tentative plans were being 
made for mandela to be released in january

a year ago murka the cat was banished from her 
moscow home for eating two canaries 
today she is home happy and pregnant 
the saga of the feline who managed to find her way home from 
voronezh 400 miles south of moscow was related in the newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda thursday 
the gray and white cat caught and killed the first canary two 
years ago when it was out of its cage in the apartment of her owner 
vladimir dontsov the paper said 
a year later murka somehow unlocked the birdcage and killed the 
second 
thus it happened that she found herself in voronezh she was 
exiled there to stay with the dontsov childrens grandmother 
komsomolskaya pravda said 
murka stayed at the grandmothers house for only two days before 
disappearing 
on oct 19 dontsov was on his way to work in moscow when he 
spotted the cat on the fourth floor of their apartment building 
dirty and hungry and minus part of her tail 
without any information desk she found her way to the correct 
neighborhood the newspaper said 
komsomolskaya pravda said the case of murka was not unique but 
that animal psychologists still cannot explain how some animals can 
find their way home from hundreds of miles away 
murka apparently found both adventure and romance during her 
yearlong journey 
it resulted in the loss of the tip of her tail and an injured 
ear it said and it added she is pregnant

a usbacked guerrilla group claimed 
thursday that cambodian troops have resorted to shelling civilian 
portions of a western provincial town they have been unable to 
recapture 
the vietnamesebacked government forces fired sovietmade 130mm 
cannons and 122mm rockets into thmar puok in western battambang 
province on wednesday according to the resistance group led by 
cambodian prince norodom sihanouk 
it said 55000 civilians live in thmar puok one of several 
towns the guerrillas captured in early october along route 69 in 
the province which borders thailand 
no mention was made of casualties in wednesdays shelling but 
the group said one civilian was killed and eight wounded when 
government forces last shelled the area oct 23 
the guerrillas seized thmar puok as part of their advance to 
svay chek the only big town blocking the way to the governments 
military center of sisophon 25 miles south of thmar puok 
on wednesday the official phnom penh radio said government 
forces launched operations to clear route 69 and that the enemy was 
routed in one village in the area 
but a resistance official abdulgaffar peangmeth said thursday 
that svay chek is strangled and our forces have blocked off all 
the access routes svay chek will fall like a ripe fruit when the 
time comes 
abdulgaffar said few guerrillas have been killed in the battle 
for svay chek but many have been wounded by artillery shelling and 
land mines 
abdulgaffar is the main military analyst of the khmer peoples 
national liberation front the front and sihanouks forces both 
noncommunist are joined with the communist khmer rouge in a 
guerrilla coalition fighting the government vietnam installed in 
cambodia after invading in late 1978 
all three groups have made significant battlefield advances 
since late september when vietnam staged what it called the 
withdrawal of its last troops from the country 
cambodias official spk news agency said thursday that

not martial law as reported by a thai newspaper a day earlier

provincial capital at battambang the countrys secondlargest 
city after taking the nearby strategic town of pailin on oct 22

rouge attack on battambang was merely propaganda to boost the khmer 
rouges standing at the united nations the general assembly is 
soon to debate the issue of cambodias seat at the world body now 
held by the guerrilla coalition 
the fall of pailin has heightened fears of the return of the 
khmer rouge which killed hundreds of thousands of people when it 
ruled cambodia for thre years until vietnams invasion ousted it in 
1978 
vietnam said it completed pulling its troops out at the end of

christer pettersson likely was the man 
seen outside a movie theater where prime minister olof palme was 
slain but it has not been proved he killed the swedish leader an 
appeals court said today 
police however said petterson was still under investigation 
pettersson 42 was convicted by a district court in july of 
killing palme three years ago and sentenced to life in prison 
however the svea court of appeals court threw out his 
conviction on oct 12 and ordered him freed saying that there was 
not enough evidence to conclusively prove his guilt 
the appeals court today released its formal written ruling of 
that verdict making clear that there was not enough evidence to 
convict pettersson but also raising doubts about his innocence 
palme who was prime minister for 11 years and scandinavias 
leading international figure was shot feb 28 1986 while walking 
home from a movie in downtown oslo with his wife lisbeth 
mrs palmes testimony the key evidence against pettersson 
left too much room for uncertainty the appeallate court said 
it cannot be considered proved that the perpetrator is 
identical with christer pettersson therefore the court leaves the 
indictment unsanctioned the court said 
but ingemar krusell a senior investigator said police have 
formed a special squad focusing on finding evidence against 
pettersson while two other teams pursue other possible leads 
pettersson is still a suspect with us the national news 
agency tt quoted him as saying 
the verdict said pettersson had no alibi and was most likely the 
man who was seen outside the theater apparently waiting for the 
prime minister to leave 
pettersson had said he was at a surburban train station at the 
time palme was shot in downtown stockholm 
but the court said the prosecutor had not erased all doubts that 
he committed the murder and that mrs palmes identification of 
him was insufficient evidence 
mrs palme identified pettersson as the man she saw a few feet 
away when she looked up from her dying husband 
but the court said mrs palme had seen the gunman only for an 
instant in poor light when she was under great stress and that the 
widow was asked to make her identification after a gap of three 
years 
the court also said there no murder weapon was found and that 
pettersson had no apparent motive for the slaying also the 
shooting gives the impression of a certain amount of planning 
uncharacteristic of pettersson the court said

west german authorities issued a 
general warning about possible terrorist attacks the month before 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 but there were no lastminute 
warnings an official said today 
a bomb destroyed the plane on dec 21 over lockerbie scotland 
killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
pan am said in papers filed in us district court in washington 
that west german authorities had warned us officials of 
suspicious activities in the baggage loading area at frankfurt 
airport shortly before flight 103 left for london 
the airline trying to defend itself against more than 300 
million in lawsuits filed by victims families specifically 
referred to the bundeskriminalamt the federal criminal 
investigations office that is the equivalent of the fbi 
pan am said it wants information about any warnings from the 
west german agency within the 90 minutes before the scheduled 
departure from frankfurt concerning suspicious activities in the 
baggage loading area 
in its report wednesday on the pan am action the independent 
newspaper in london said the subpoena mentions warnings from 
the bka within 90 minutes before the scheduled departure from 
frankfurt of pan am flight 103 on december 21 1988 to the effect 
that suspicious activities appeared to be taking place in the area 
where the baggage was being loaded 
the assertions brought a sharp denial today from the criminal 
investigations office in wiesbaden 
we issued no such warning bundeskriminalamt spokesman willi 
fundermann told the associated press in a telephone interview 
the agency had issued a very general warning the month 
before the attack following suspicions regarding a group of alleged 
palestinian terrorists rounded up in west germany fundermann said 
some news reports have claimed the group the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command is linked to the pan 
am bombing 
the head of the bundeskriminalamt press office brunhilde 
spiesmohr issued a written denial about the alleged warning 
shortly before takeoff 
the bundeskriminalamt rejects foreign news reports according 
to which bka officials allegedly pointed out to us officials 
suspicious activities in the baggage area at frankfurt airport 90 
minutes before the start of pan am flight 103 she said 
this report is without any foundation ms spiesmohr said 
in her written statement 
west german officials have frequently criticized news media 
reports especially those in british papers that have accused the 
germans of bungling the case 
if the bundeskriminalamt were to investigate things as badly 
as occasionally portrayed in the foreign news media we could be 
certainly be accused of superficial work ms spiesmohr said 
pan american world airways also is trying to prove that israel 
warned us authorities about an impending terrorist attack on 
flight 103

solidarity leader lech walesa on thursday 
thanked the united states for its first emergency shipment of 
grain although he said hed rather be accepting combines than corn 
i am not delighted with this kind of help said walesa i 
treat this help as a kind of necessity so we can work out 
solutions 
the emergency food arriving from the united states and the 
european community is intended to help poland weather shortages and 
other ill effects of economic reform without an explosion of public 
unrest that could threaten the solidarityled government of prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
about 11500 tons of usdonated sorghum arrived by ship monday 
at the baltic port of gydnia about 10 miles from gdansk the 
headquarters of the solidarity movement 
we need more the means of production than the product itself 
but i am thankful for this help because it will enable us 
peaceful reforms walesa said at his weekly news conference 
i urge everone to produce food here he said for example 
it would be better if americans could send the equivalent in 
combines and machines and then the farmers could produce in 
poland 
walesa will be able to deliver his message in person next week 
when he leaves for his first trip to north america he will visit 
canada on nov 1113 and then go to the united states where he 
will address congress on nov 15 
president bush has been under pressure from democratic 
congressional leaders to increase the aid he proposed for the first 
east bloc country not led by a communist 
but walesa said he is going to the united states to gain 
friends and not to divide them and wont let himself be drawn 
into a political struggle 
right at the airport i am going to say i am coming here only 
to thank you and ask for understanding for the polish reforms 
please do not use me for election purposes and political aims 
because they are your own internal problems and not our problems 
walesa said the journey represents my most difficult trip 
while he intends to thank americans for their support over the 
years he said he also will try to urge the united states to turn 
their eyes to poland especially in the time of reforms and to 
take part in those reforms 
walesa who was not allowed to travel abroad for seven years 
after martial law was imposed to crush his independent union made 
his first foreign trip in 1988 to france

the house today overwhelmingly condemned 
nicaraguas cancellation of a ceasefire saying president daniel 
ortegas complaints of renewed rebel attacks are a phony 
pretext for renewing the fighting 
the lawmakers voted 37929 for a nonbinding resolution 
denouncing ortegas resumption of military action against the 
contra rebels and opposing any effort to cancel or delay national 
elections scheduled for next feb 25 
ortega must cease his reckless rhetoric and nicaraguas 
leftist leaders must fulfill commitments to end their aggression 
in the region end their tyranny over their own people and permit 
the establishment of democracy inside nicaragua the resolution 
said 
any attempt to put off the elections or to impose a state of 
emergency under the phony pretext of a major contrainitiated 
breakdown of the ceasefire is deplored by congress it said 
the resolution was identical to one passed 950 by the senate on 
tuesday house republicans used a parliamentary tactic to 
substitute the toughworded senate measure for a watereddown 
version that had been approved on wednesday by the house foreign 
affairs committee 
in the committees version the usbacked contras were also 
admonished not to interfere with or disrupt the election process 
and to abide by the ceasefire the senate language focused 
entirely on the actions of the sandinista government 
the resolution reaffirmed us intentions to continue 
humanitarian aid to the contras now flowing at a rate of about 4 
million a month through february the aid is subject to review by 
congress at the end of this month and could be halted if key 
lawmakers believe the rebels are not conforming to the peace 
process 
the action reflected widespread outrage on capitol hill with 
ortegas wednesday announcement but also the feeling that it was 
important to keep the elections alive 
i cant conceive of the house moving now toward providing 
military assistance to the contras said house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash thats not in the direction of the peace process 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan suggested opposition 
candidate violeta chamorro be invited to address a formal joint 
meeting of congress when she visits washington next week an honor 
normally reserved for foreign heads of state 
longtime opponents of aid to the rebels said ortega had put 
those who had supported the peace process in a delicate political 
position 
ortega is a damned fool and hes always been a damned fool 
said rep david obey dwis chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the aid 
sen patrick leahy dvt obeys senate counterpart noted the 
issue of contra aid had seemed dead daniel ortega is doing 
everything possible to turn that around he is doing more to stir 
support for it than anyone else in this hemisphere he said 
sen christopher dodd dconn said the united states should 
urge international groups like the united nations and the 
organization of american states to press ortega to reconsider 
i would like to think my colleagues would exercise some 
caution and not go charging over the cliff he said 
the key right now is to try to act so swiftly and to send such 
strong signals that military aid is not necessary because the 
ceasefire doesnt get broken said rep newt gingrich 
rga the no 2 house gop leadership official 
but gingrich added its important for the congress on a 
bipartisan basis to send a signal to ortega that we are not going 
to stand by and see people slaughtered by a communist army which 
ruthlessly violates the ceasefire in order to preempt the 
election

fighting in laos

the issue was discussed in talks in vientiane on thursday between 
teams led by david f lambertson us deputy assistant secretary 
of state for asian affairs and souban salitthilat laos deputy 
foreign minister 
in 1989 two joint excavations to find the remains of the 
missing americans were conducted together with a further survey

the white house said today it is unrealistic 
to expect nicaraguas contra rebels to lay down their arms when the 
leftist sandinista government is out to destroy them by 
breaking the ceasefire 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united states 
still backs the regional peace accord that calls for the contras to 
voluntarily disband by dec 5 and return to their homeland if they 
so desire but he also indicated that this support is tied to 
nicaraguan president daniel ortegas decision to restart the war 
you cant ask people to repatriate themselves into a climate 
where theyre threatened with death the spokesman told 
reporters i dont think anybody expects demobilization to 
proceed as long as the sandinistas are on the offensive attack to 
try to destroy them 
meanwhile today the house adopted 37929 a senatepassed 
resolution that condemned ortega for canceling the ceasefire and 
opposed any effort to cancel or delay national elections scheduled 
for next feb 25 
ortega must cease his reckless rhetoric and nicaraguas 
leftist leaders must fulfill commitments to end their aggression 
in the region end their tyranny over their own people and permit 
the establishment of democracy inside nicaragua the resolution 
said 
fitzwater replied indirectly when asked if the administration 
wants the contras to remain together as a fighting force until the 
feb 25 elections or disband by dec 5 as called for in the 
regional accord signed this year in tela honduras 
we want the tela accords to be complied with and we are not 
willing to say what might happen and speculate on those actions 
but simply to point out the reality of the situation which is the 
sandinistas are attacking them what do you expect them to do 
fitzwater said 
if theyre going to go home and be killed its pretty hard to 
ask them to do it 
mr ortega has forced the situation fitzwater said of the 
nicaraguan leaders announcement that his leftist government would 
no longer honor the unilateral ceasefire 
although president bush and members of congress have harshly 
criticized ortega for canceling the ceasefire they do not appear 
ready to resume military aid to the contras who are reported to be 
reentering nicaragua 
us officials said wednesday up to 1500 contras have crossed 
the border into nicaragua over the past month from base camps in 
honduras bringing the guerrillas troop strength to about 4000 
ortega cited renewed rebel attacks as the reason for suspending 
the ceasefire and hinted he might cancel the national elections 
saying the actions of yankee congress and the yankee president 
will determine whether they take place 
later a nicaraguan official said that country has no plans to 
cancel the elections and ortega insisted in a column published in 
todays new york times that the elections will be held and that the 
sandinistas will win 
bush lashed out at ortega saying the man is so out of step 
with the other democratic countries in this hemisphere and so 
wildly insensitive to the feelings of others that we shouldnt have 
been surprised by his action 
on the other hand i dont think he has unleashed a fullscale 
offensive at this moment bush said in a radio interview with abc 
news hes hedging his bets now 
ortegas announcement that he was calling off the truce reached 
in march 1988 touched off highlevel meetings among administration 
officials and expressions of anger on capitol hill 
ortega is a damned fool and hes always been a damned fool 
said rep david obey dwis chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over aid to the contras 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said i cant conceive 
of the house moving now toward providing military assistance 
thats not in the direction of the peace process 
asked about prospects for renewing military aid for the rebels 
white house spokesman fitzwater said wednesday we dont want to 
go that route we want to get free elections 
but some conservative supporters of the contras began discussing 
legislative language that could lead to renewal of military aid to 
the contras if the elections are canceled or delayed 
the administration said bush was consulting with leaders in 
central america to bring diplomatic pressure on ortega to reverse 
course 
ortega wrote in the times it is now clear that there is 
little point in concentrating our peace efforts around the single 
issue of a ceasefire we do not consider it an acceptable 
ceasefire when we cease and the contras fire 
one major irritant to the administration was the seizure at the 
honduran border two weeks ago of a large quantity of weapons the 
sandinistas reportedly had earmarked for leftist rebels in el 
salvador 
officials said secretary of state james a baker iii confronted 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin with photographs of some of the 
seized equipment including sovietmade ak47 rifles 
under a central american peace plan the contras are supposed to 
be disarmed and demobilized by dec 5 sources said many contras 
decided to return to nicaragua because it would be far easier for 
them to escape demobilization if they were wandering undetected 
inside nicaraguan territory 
at the same time the rebels have asked the us agency for 
international development which administers the current us 
humanitarian aid program for the contras for food packaged in 
smaller more easily portable quantities and for increased amounts 
of cash in nicaraguan currency said an official familiar with the 
aid program 
aid has refused the requests believing that to help the 
reinfiltration effort would be a wrong signal said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the administration has asked the rebels to continue to observe 
the cease fire and the contra leadership reaffirmed wednesday from 
their honduran base camps they would do so 
but ortega said the rebels have been escalating attacks against 
civilians recently alejandro bendana a top nicaraguan foreign 
ministry official said wednesday night 44 civilians have been 
killed by contra forces over the past 10 days 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson who appeared with 
bendana on pbs mcneillehrer news hour said the sandinistas 
never obeyed the ceasefire launching a major offensive against 
the contras a month after signing it he added that 90 contras have 
been victims of summary executions by the sandinistas

the former acting administrator of the new 
york regional hud office has been reassigned to a job at 
headquarters after an investigation concluded she violated the 
agencys code of conduct a spokesman says 
hud general counsel frank keating concluded that geraldine 
mcgann behaved unethically by voting on hudrelated issues as a 
trustee of the village of island park ny according to a hud 
audit and other documents obtained under the freedom of information 
act keating pronounced the internal investigation closed 
mcgann is now working as a special assistant in huds office of 
housing until such time as other investigations are concluded 
hud spokesman jack flynn said wednesday he was referring to 
criminal investigations being conducted by us attorney andrew 
maloney in new york and nassau county district attorney denis 
dillon 
she has no direct management role and is not involved in 
funding decisions flynn said adding that mcgann continues to be 
paid the same salary she made as regional administrator 68500 a 
year 
mcgann did not immediately return a phone call thursday seeking 
comment 
the internal investigation of mcgann stemmed from her dual role 
as a department of housing and urban development employee and a 
trustee of the village of island park long island minutes of the 
island park board meetings show mcgann voted on hudrelated 
resolutions from 1982 to 1989 a violation of huds code of conduct 
trustees who served with ms mcgann advised that it was her 
position to abstain from voting on hud resolutions and that the 
minutes must have been drafted or recorded incorrectly said an 
audit completed aug 30 by huds office of inspector general 
however island park residents present at various meetings 
advised that they heard ms mcgann both vote in the affirmative and 
abstain with regard to hudrelated matters 
she also voted to approve the villages annual budget which 
generally included hud funds according to the inchthick audit in 
addition investigators obtained a tape recording of a nov 17 
1988 board meeting at which mcgann discussed a controversial 
swimming pool that island park was trying to build using a 425000 
hud grant obtained by the towns favorite son sen alfonse 
damato rny 
island park dropped the project after a spate of reports 
ridiculing it hud and damato for directing federal housing money 
to a pool for a middleclass beachfront community 
the latest audit reaffirms some conclusions of a january 1984 
hud audit of a federally subsidized housing program in island park 
that investigation found inexpensive hud houses were being steered 
to white politically connected village residents to the exclusion 
of minorities it also found that mcgann had apparently voted on 
hud issues before the board of trustees and noted that one of the 
subsidized houses went to mcganns son daniel 
subsequently geraldine mcgann told hud investigators that the 
board minutes were erroneous and thenvillage clerk harry scully 
sent a letter to hud saying he had incorrectly recorded some votes 
in 1988 mcgann moved up to acting administrator of the hud 
regional office which then served new york new jersey and puerto 
rico 
but in june the new york times reported that scully had 
recanted the letter and was saying he had lied to protect mcgann 
she was suspended as acting administrator in august she also 
resigned as trustee

south african officials 
thursday refused to retract allegations against namibias black 
nationalist guerrillas despite evidence that charges of a 
treatybreaking incursion were based in part on faked radio 
messages 
president fw de klerk and top members of his government 
insisted the southwest africa people organization had plans to 
disrupt elections in namibia next week that are a step toward the 
territorys independence from south africa 
swapos hands are anything but clean de klerk said in a 
speech 
foreign minister pik botha said wednesday that south africa had 
placed its troops on alert and was prepared to delay the nov 711 
elections due to an alleged incursion into northern namibia by 
swapo guerrillas based in angola botha said member of the un 
monitoring force reported in internal radio traffic the 
infiltration of 600 guerrillas from oct 2631 
fred eckhard a un spokesman in namibia said however that the 
messages are phony in content and format 
he said un communications experts and military personnel 
examined the information provided by south african officials and 
determined that the messages do not emanate from any un 
source 
eckhard declined to say whether the united nations believed the 
south africans fabricated the radio messages themselves or were 
victims of a hoax 
northern namibia was calm thursday eckhard said un soldiers 
and territorial police were conducting regular patrols along the 
namibiaangola border and had not reported any evidence of an 
incursion 
eckhard also said the un force had no evidence of swapo 
guerrillas deploying near the namibian border in southernmost 
angola 
however south africas armed forces chief gen jannie 
geldenhuys and its territorial administrator in namibia louis 
pienaar both said there were large numbers of guerrillas in 
southern angola in violation of an accord requiring them to have 
moved farther north 
swapos secretary for information hidipo hamutanya rejected 
the south african claims saying the whole thing is a 
smokescreen by south africa to influence the outcome of the 
elections 
hamutenya said swapo had 300 guerrillas still in angola but 
they were far north of the border and in compliance with all 
international agreements 
swapo maintained bases in angola during its 23year war against 
south african rule but is not supposed to have armed personnel 
near the border or in namibia during the transitional period 
under the uns independence plan south africa has withdrawn 
virtually all of its troops from namibia and law enforcement 
duties are being carried out by the territorial police force 
on april 1 the official start of the transitional period south 
africa said hundreds of swapo guerrillas had crossed into namibia 
from angola in violation of international agreements about 280 
guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces were killed in 
subsequent fighting according to south africa which received un 
permission to deploy its troops against swapo 
swapo is favored to get the most votes in the election for seats 
in an assembly that will draft a constitution for namibia which 
has been ruled by south africa since 1915 it would need twothirds 
of the vote to have complete control over the drafting process 
the treaty that paved the way for independence also calls for 
cuba to remove its 50000 soldiers from marxistruled angola cuba 
announced earlier this week that 25000 of the troops had left on 
schedule

congressional negotiators reached a tentative 
agreement today on a 305 billion defense bill that cuts 11 
billion from president bushs strategic defense initiative request 
although lawmakers indicated that the only remaining task was 
final signatures on the package by house and senate negotiators a 
few house members still expressed their opposition to the 
conference report 
the deal is done said rep ike skelton dmo a member of 
the house armed services committee 
we have an agreement but we have to sign off said rep 
george buddy darden dga another member of the house panel 
late wednesday four house democrats criticized the conferences 
plan to fund both the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles and said 
they hoped to scuttle efforts to finish the defense bill after 
nearly eight weeks of wrangling 
i hope it kills the conference rep charles bennett 
dfla chairman of a house armed services subcommittee said after 
he and three other lawmakers said they could not sign the 
provisional conference report 
the compromise package based on house and senate bills passed 
in early august includes a 11 billion cut in president bushs 
request for the sdi for a pentagon total of 355 billion and one 
less b2 stealth bomber than the administration sought said 
lawmakers and congressional sources who requested anonymity 
the level of funding for sdi prompted conservative groups to 
call for a presidential veto of the defense bill saying the amount 
would signal the demise of the program 
this is a critical time for sdi john kwapisz executive 
director fo the center for peace and freedom told reporters 
wheres george he has not spoken out in support of sdi 
prosdi groups such as americans for the high frontier the 
american conservative union and coalitions for america said if the 
president accepts an sdi level less than 385 billion he must 
share some of the blame with congress for the eventual demise of 
the program 
the defense bill includes about 12 billion for the mx 
multiplewarhead railbased missile and the midgetman 
singlewarhead truckbased missile which is equivalent to the 
11 billion bush proposed for the mx and 100 million for the 
midgetman 
the bill requires defense secretary dick cheney to cut 100 
million from the 12 billion and gives him discretion on how to 
spend the remaining amount cheney favored funding only the mx 
missile but bush opted for both landbased nuclear missiles 
that provision drew complaints from the four house members 
including three chairmen of armed services subcommittees 
we feel that the proposed deal on the b2 strategic defense 
initiative and mobile icbms is inadequate and we cannot sign the 
conference report in its present form the four said in a letter 
to rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services panel 
a real opportunity to assert leadership would be lost unless 
we eliminate funding for one of the two mobile icbms this could 
be achieved by eliminating the midgetman the lawmakers said 
signing the letter were bennett chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical 
materials patricia schroeder dcolo chairman of the 
subcommittee on military installations and facilities ronald 
dellums dcalif chairman of the subcommittee on research and 
development and lane evans dill a member of the full panel 
questioned about the letter bennett said supporters of the 
midgetman tout it as a key bargaining chip in ussoviet 
negotiations to reduce strategic weapons but the florida democrat 
scoffed at the idea of spending millions of dollars on a 
bargaining chip

a pilots association representative said 
today he has questions about the significance of a serial number 
mixup in a flawed engine fan disk installed in a dc10 that 
crashed killing 112 people 
i dont think the records exist properly to answer that 
question right now db robinson an accident investigator for 
the pilots union said during a break in a national transportation 
safety board hearing on the accident 
a rear engine fan disk that split apart in midair is being 
blamed for the crash of united flight 232 as it made an emergency 
landing at sioux citys airport july 19 
a more detailed test than one conducted before the crash would 
have detected the faulty part an engineer told federal 
investigators 
a crack in the disk probably existed when the disk was last 
inspected in february 1988 said chris glynn a design engineer for 
general electric co which manufactured the engine 
james tucker general manager of product operations for ges 
airplane engine plant in evendale ohio acknowledged wednesday the 
company unwittingly listed two new engine fan disks under the same 
serial number in 1971 one of the disks was to be destroyed because 
tests showed it might be faulty the second was to be sent on for 
installation in a dc10 
company officials were unaware of the double bookkeeping entry 
when they pulled records on engine fan disk 00385 the serial 
number of the disk that split in midair 
but tucker said company officials are certain the faulty disk 
with the same serial number was destroyed in 1972 and did not wind 
up in the rear engine of united flight 232 
theres no way that this could have been assembled in that 
engine he told ntsb officials at the fourday hearing that 
concludes friday 
robinson however said he wasnt convinced 
im not satisfied but im not dissatisfied either he said 
the board will discover whats going on it will be resolved 
ultrasonic testing in february 1988 probably would have led to 
the engines recall glynn told the ntsb at the hearing wednesday 
united spokesman robert doughty said that since the crash the 
federal aviation administration has ordered more detailed 
inspections involving ultrasonic examination of all disks similar 
to the titanium disk that split apart near the tail of the plane 
such testing can detect cracks and other flaws beneath the 
surface in a block of material before the crash surface testing 
of disks was deemed adequate 
if the ultrasonic testing had been required it the crack 
would have been discovered doughty said during a break in 
testimony 
the crash occurred as the crippled plane was brought in for an 
emergency landing at the sioux city airport after its rear engine 
exploded in over northwest iowa the explosion severed the planes 
three hydraulic lines rendering the aircraft virtually 
unmanageable 
the rear engines huge fan disk was found in two sections in 
northwest iowa farm fields initial testing has found a crack 
measuring onehalf inch deep and more than an inch long in the 
larger section of the disk according to an ntsb report

there is no evidence to show that underground 
nuclear tests in nevada jeopardize the health of nearby residents 
although radioactive materials have periodically been released by 
the blasts a congressional study concludes 
the report by congress office of technology assessment said 
that since 1970 the underground tests have released about 54000 
curies of radiation an amount the study said would give a resident 
living near the test site all that time about the same exposure to 
radiation as a single xray 
the report released this week said there is no need to improve 
radiation containment procedures in connection with the tests but 
it suggested that the government abandon its practice of keeping 
such tests secret 
the secrecy associated with the program is largely 
ineffective the report said adding that public concern about 
such tests could be reduced if citizens were told of the tests for 
the most part word of the tests becomes publicly available anyway 
because workers are evacuated from the test site and the 
underground explosions are detected from seismic signals 
the study had been requested by sen orrin hatch rutah who 
said the findings demonstrate that no significant health risks 
are likely to result from the underground tests at the nevada 
test site 
more than a dozen nuclear weapons are detonated underground each 
year at the nevada site the tests are used to develop new weapons 
and assess the effects of nuclear explosions on military equipment 
the congressional study said elaborate efforts are made to 
prevent radiation from being released the 54000 curies released 
from 126 tests since 1970 compares to more than 12 billion curies 
of radiation that were released in tests prior to 1970 the report 
said 
the report noted concerns among some nevada citizens over 
whether some areas of the test site such as the rainier mesa are 
strong enough to contain the underground radiation ground cracks 
have been found on the mesa near where tests were conducted 
but the ota study said the cracks do not indicate a greater 
possiblity of radiation leaks it said tests on the mesa are 
conducted deeper than similar tests at yucca flat and that drill 
samples near the cracks show no weakening of rock strength because 
the cracks do not extend down to the test region

radicals plan an outpouring of hatred 
saturday to mark the day the us embassy was seized in 1979 and 
some diplomats view the plans as a challenge to president hashemi 
rafsanjanis more moderate faction 
ali akbar mohtashemi a hardliner rafsanjani dropped as 
interior minister will address a rally outside the former embassy 
building which militants stormed nov 4 1979 he is the 
presidents main rival and has close links to shiite moslem 
fundamentalists holding western hostages in lebanon 
it will be the first public appearance by mohtashemi 43 since 
he was pushed out rafsanjani who formed his government in august 
and leads the pragmatists who seek to end irans isolation 
radicals have whipped up antiamerican passion for days 
undermining what had appeared to be a government attempt at 
moderation on the 10th anniversary of the beginning of 444 days in 
captivity for 52 americans 
workers strung scores of cloth banners thursday between the 
maple trees lining taleghani a broad avenue that runs past the 
embassys main entrance 
among the inscriptions were no relations with the united 
states and strike down global arrogance to protect the islamic 
revolution 
promoters call saturdays anniversary the national day of 
struggle with global arrogance and the worlddevouring united 
states global arrogance like the great satan has become a 
synonym for the united states 
rafsanjani is trying to revive the moribund economy after a 
truce last year in the eightyear war with iraq and has sought 
better relations with the west in part to secure help with a 
rebuilding program estimated to cost 400 billion 
revolutionary hardliners fear opening up to the world will 
dilute the ideological purity of the fundamentalist revolution 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini led from the takeover of iran in 
february 1979 until his death june 3 
rumors had spread that mohtashemi was under house arrest but he 
turned up in lebanon last month meeting with shiite leaders the 
reason for his visit was not clear but speculation arose that it 
concerned the 18 western hostages who include eight americans 
since becoming president rafsanjani has made tentative offers 
to help obtain their release if the united states met certain 
conditions 
diplomats consider the radical attempt to make saturdays 
anniversary a show of antiamericanism a kind of showdown with 
the pragmatists 
that theory was bolstered wednesday when the majlis irans 
parliament enacted a law empowering the government to arrest 
americans anywhere in the world for offending iran and bring them 
to tehran for trial 
officials said the bill responded to a us justice department 
ruling months ago allowing the fbi to arrest terrorism suspects in 
other countries without prior approval of the governments involved 
the ruling contained no reference to iran 
why the response took so long was not clear but the bills 
swift introduction and passage neatly coincided with the 
anniversary 
militants who seized the embassy compound in downtown tehran 
apparently had khomeinis blessing the crisis including a rescue 
attempt that came to disaster in the desert south of tehran 
crippled president jimmy carters administration and helped cost 
him the 1980 election 
assadollah bayat the radical deputy speaker of parliament 
declared thursday that iran never will resume the relations broken 
by the united states after the embassy seizure 
the united states has adopted a hostile brutal and inhuman 
attitude against iran after the success of the islamic 
revolution he declared 
echoing a speech wednesday by ayatollah ali khamenei the 
supreme political and spiritual leader bayat exhorted iranians to 
wage perpetual struggle against arrogant powers headed by the 
united states 
by contrast rafsanjani said last week that washington had sent 
messages to iran through two neighboring countries presumably 
pakistan and turkey seeking better relations 
he avoided outright rejection of the overture saying we 
still have no confidence in what they say we ask for signs and 
indications of goodwill on their part 
officials said demonstrators would burn 160 american flags 
saturday 10 for each of 16 shiites beheaded in saudi arabia in 
september for bombings in the holy city of mecca during this years 
annual moslem pilgrimage the bombs killed one man and wounded 16 
the days events will begin with a news conference in the former 
embassy compound at which iranians said to have spied for the 
united states will be put on display

bush administration officials told congress 
thursday the proportion of refugees coming to the united states 
from east european countries other than poland and hungary likely 
will rise under an expected new policy based on the danger of 
persecution 
princeton n lyman director of the state departments bureau 
for refugee programs testified that the administration policy is 
undergoing a review that should be completed in a few weeks 
he spoke before the house judiciary committees immigration 
subcommittee at a hearing on the question of refugees from eastern 
europe but not including the soviet union 
administration witnesses testified that the governments of 
poland and hungary are becoming more liberal so that the danger of 
persecution there is receding while that is not the case in 
czechoslovakia and romania 
of 25000 east europeans waiting in west european camps in the 
hope of coming to the united states about 80 percent come from 
poland and hungary but more refugees from romania are now 
appearing in western europe and also in hungary 
one possibility being considered is help for some of those poles 
and hungarians to return home said lyman 
we have to be fair to the 25000 who have been waiting some 
of them for a long time he said we have to look at 
repatriation 
rep marcy kaptur dohio suggested that the united states work 
with france and west germany to help such poles and hungarians she 
said they would not be accepted easily back home 
rep bruce a morrison dconn who chaired the hearing said 
that these are just the kind of people americans would like to see 
back in their own countries working for more democracy 
a little international help would go a long way he said 
lyman also pointed out that few east germans seek to come to the 
united states the overwhelming majority leaving their country go 
to west germany 
he predicted a rise in the proportion of refugees from countries 
where there is a real fear of persecution 
one dilemma we face is the danger that the very existence of a 
continuing us refugee admissions program for poles and hungarians 
will act as a magnet drawing more people into austria and other 
western european countries he said 
for the year that began oct 1 the united states will accept 
50000 refugees from the soviet union and 6500 from other 
countries in eastern europe 
nancy r kingsbury of the congressional general accounting 
office testified that only 1500 places out of the 6500 will are 
still available the other 5000 have already been assigned to 
people approved last year for admittance to the united states 
rep william o lipinski dill urged that the number for the 
whole area including the soviet union be raised to 100000 a year 
for 10 years 
given their qualifications as well as a forthcoming american 
labor shortage the united states would benefit tremendously from 
increased immigration he said

the government divided over britains increasing 
isolation in europe on thursday unveiled an alternative goslow 
approach to plans for european monetary union 
earlier rumors of an alleged insidertrading scandal involving 
a cabinet minister shook the london stock market transport 
secretary cecil parkinson denied speculation he was involved and 
the markets steadied 
but the jittery reaction reflected edginess about the 
government already shaken by last weeks resignation of the top 
treasury official chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson he 
quit in a policy dispute with prgaret thatcher over 
europe 
the new chancellor john major issued a government paper laying 
down what he termed britains marketbased approach to the 
developmentrime minister ma of economic and monetary union among the 12 
nations of 
the eec 
the british plan said it was far too early to commit the eec 
to having a single currency and central bank envisioned in the 
current plan drawn up by jacques delors head of the european 
commission at the communitys headquarters in brussels 
french president francois mitterrand president of the 12nation 
eec is pressing the delors plan 
last month mitterrand went further and said econoshows you can achieve 
closer economic and monetary 
cooperation much better and more rapidly by working with the grain 
of market forces than by setting up new bureaucratic and highly 
centralized institutions which are not accountable to anybody 
she added 
mrs thatcher in june rejected the single central bank and 
onecurrency notions as removing from national governments 
fundamental powers to decide on economic policy 
mrs thatcher agreed however on strict conditions that britain 
will in principle join the currencystabilizing mechanism of the 
european monetary system that links nine of the eec currencies 
but she is unenthusiastic about the idea while lawson wanted to 
join as soon as possible he quit saying he could no longer carry 
on while mrs thatcher retained a personal economic adviser who 
opposes british membership the adviser then also resigned 
london share prices tumbled in early trading after rumors swept 
the market that another cabinet minister was likely to resign in 
the alleged insiderdealing scandal 
after several hours of speculation that parkinson was the 
minister he issued a statement through his lawyers saying he has 
not engaged in any insider dealing nor in any share dealings 
the statement added that parkinson transferred his funds to 
stockbrokers after he joined the cabinet in 1987 and had since 
played no part whatsoever in any investments the brokers made 
the rumors began after the scotsman a newspaper based in 
edinburgh reported that britains channel 4 television network has 
investigated an insiderdealing group that allegedly has at least 
one senior government member among its clients 
channel 4 confirmed it is working on an investigation but said 
the program was as yet neither complete nor scheduled 
insider trading is the illegal attempt to profit by buying and 
selling stock based on inside information about a company such as 
takeover offers or profits prospects which is not available to the 
public

witnesses told congress thursday that 
political repression and human rights abuses remain facts of 
political life in the soviet union despite mikhail s gorbachevs 
new policies 
all of the witnesses before a house foreign affairs subcommittee 
acknowleged that there have been significant and unanticipated 
human rights advances under the leadership of the soviet president 
but all said that the new freedoms of glasnost have been 
incomplete and halting 
its a case of two steps forward one step back and every 
days newspaper is evidence of that said holly burkhalter 
washington director of helsinki watch the observer group that 
monitors human rights developments in the soviet union

including the expansion of legitimate private enterprise broadened 
religious rights a more independent press greater freedom of 
expression a less oppressive kgb psychiatric reforms and a 
dramatic increase in emigration 
but owens and the witnesses said the silver cloud has a dark 
lining 
paradoxically glasnost has sometimes led to increased human 
rights abuses as the authorities have countered with new types of 
repres several protestors taking part in a weekend 
moscow demonstrattion held to call attention to past kgb killings 
of political prisoners were clubbed and dragged to waiting

criminal charges in a post office procurement 
case should be dismissed defense lawyers argued thursday 
contending prosecutors unfairly manipulated grand jury witnesses to 
obtain an indictment against a texas company 
midway through a criminal trial attorneys for recognition 
equipment inc and two of its top executives moved for the case to 
be thrown out because the government showed its star witness 
previous grand jury testimony 
government investigators were threatening executive 
recruiter william spartin and then poisoning his recollections 
through unlawful exposure to the grand jury testimony of others 
defense attorneys said in a 69page court filing 
dallasbased rei and executives william moore and robert reedy 
are accused of conspiring to corrupt the federal procurement 
process in 1985 in an attempt to win a 250 million contract to 
build mailsorting equipment 
at the urging of peter voss then vice chairman of the postal 
board of governors rei hired a consulting firm owned by john gnau 
and of which spartin was president gnau then made illegal payoffs 
to voss in a scheme to which both men have pleaded guilty and have 
been sent to prison spartin has been granted immunity from 
prosecution 
assistant us attorney joseph valder showed spartin summary 
statements of previous grand jury witnesses making it impossible 
for spartin to distinguish between what he knew and what he had 
read the defense attorneys said 
the grand jury that indicted rei was never told that the five 
main witnesses in the case were unable to implicate the company in 
payoffs to voss according to defense attorneys 
spartin says that as far as he knew rei was never told that 
gnau was paying voss but he never was permitted to tell that to 
the grand jury according to testimony at the trial 
instead spartin was asked by prosecutors in front of the grand 
jury whether he had concluded that rei must have known about the 
illegal payoffs 
spartin who had been shown statements from other grand jury 
witnesses said his opinion was that rei must have been aware of 
them 
after spartin told investigators he wasnt aware that rei had 
ever been told of the payoffs valder tore up spartins immunity 
agreement according to testimony at the trial which began sept 
28 investigators threatened to seek charges against spartins son 
for obstruction of justice in the scandal 
everybody is beating me up on this issue spartin complained 
in 1986 during one of his two polygraph examinations on the 
question of whether he knew if rei had been told of the payoffs to 
voss 
the postal inspector the us attorney what they tried 
to tell me was look spartin youre in deep trouble spartin 
said to the polygraph examiner who at the end of the exam 
identified himself as a postal inspector 
spartin told the polygraph examiner that investigators were 
telling him youve lied to us we are going to subpoena your 
son we are going to charge him with obstruction of justice 
spartins son wasnt charged 
when the polygraph examiner asked spartin whether he would tell 
if he knew something on rei spartin replied 
boy would i tell you i got nothing to lose but i cant 
make up a story

troops loyal to the leftist sandinista 
government attacked usbacked contra guerrillas just hours after 
president daniel ortega ended a 19month truce a military 
spokeswoman said today 
but the spokeswoman lt col rosa pasos denied that any 
largescale operations were involved and said most of the action 
was concentrated on rebels sneaking into nicaragua from neighboring 
honduras 
these are military operations against mercenary forces that 
have been infiltrating she added 
pasos said most of the action is concentrated in the regions 
where the bulk of an estimated 2500 contras are scattered 
pasos also confirmed a report by the sandinista national 
liberation front newspaper barricada that an army company backed by 
militias mounted the first attack against a group of about 30 
contras in the area around quilali 
she said the attack took place wednesday about two hours after 
ortega announced he would not renew the ceasefire but refused to 
pinpoint the area she said she did not have immediate reports of 
casualties 
barricada said today that combat units in 14 towns and villages 
in northern nicaragua began operations overnight against the 
rebels but gave few details 
opposition leaders have been accusing ortega of canceling the 
ceasefire because he feared holding free elections 
a rebel communique said the breaking of the ceasefire by the 
sandinista army is already in effect because the nicaraguan 
military today intensified its attacks against our forces and 
positions through widespread operations 
the communique distributed by the rebels nicaraguan resistance 
organization in tegucigalpa honduras said the leftist government 
was mounting attacks wednesday with tanks helicopter gunships and 
heavy artillery 
ortega announced at news conference broadcast live to the nation 
early in the day that he was suspending the unilateral ceasefire 
he said more than 1100 rebels had infiltrated nicaragua through 
the honduran border during the past three weeks and that rebel 
attacks had increased dramatically 
later the defense ministry said contras killed eight people and 
wounded 14 in three attacks in the northern provinces of matagalpa 
and jinotega from sunday to tuesday three of the dead were 
civilians who were kidnapped then killed a ministry communique 
said 
in an opinion piece in todays new york times ortega contended 
the contras were trying to subvert the electoral process because 
they are as convinced as i am that the nicaraguan people will 
give the sandinistas a landslide victory in elections planned for 
feb 25 
he said that during october contra units closed more than 50 
voter registration centers preventing thousands of citizens from 
registering 
they targeted for assassination known sandinista supporters 
prominent community leaders party activists and candidates for 
municipal offices and slit their throats ortega wrote 
the rebel high command said sandinista troops using heavy 
artillery and backed by sovietmade helicopters attacked wednesday 
in la sirena and batitan in the southern atlantic coast province 
of zelaya 
interior ministry troops made continuous attacks on rebels 
at sarawaca hill in the northern province of jinotega at the 
border with honduras the tegucigalpa communique said 
alfredo cesar a former director of the nicaraguan resistance 
said he believed ortegas decision to end the truce confirmed a 
thesis of president oscar arias of costa rica 
the thesis is that the sandinista front is afraid of peace 
cesar said that the sandinista front prefers war and is afraid 
of the political process in general 
cesar ended seven years of exile and returned to nicaragua 
earlier this year to join in the electoral process he is now a 
leading voice within the sandinistas main challenger the 14party 
coalition national opposition union 
the coalitions vice presidential candidate virgilio godoy 
said the governments decision to suspend the ceasefire has 
little to do with the military situation and much to do with the 
electoral situation 
ortega has said whether elections are held will depend on 
whether president bush and congress agree to push for 
demobilization of the contras 
he called for meetings next week at the united nations so 
agreement can be reached on a mechanism for dismantling the 
contras who are based in honduras 
ortega and four other central american presidents agreed aug 7 
to demobilize and relocate the rebels by dec 5 at the time about 
12000 rebels were in the honduras camps 
before announcing the recent infiltration of 1100 rebels into 
nicaragua officials had said 2000 to 3000 rebels were in the 
country 
ortega contends the contras have routinely violated the truce 
since it was signed in march 1988 a month after congress suspended 
military aid to the rebels 
he has said that in the 19 months since contra attacks in 
nicaragua have killed more than 730 people and wounded more than 
1000 mostly civilians 
the nonlethal aid package congress approved for the contras in 
march includes a clause providing for the suspension of aid should 
the contras initiate attacks in nicaragua 
the aid which includes food medicine boots and uniforms is 
to run out just after the elections

federal officials jousted thursday over a 
congressional proposal to reallocate government radio airspace to 
private uses such as mobile phones pagers and satellites and to 
assure room for new technologies such as highdefinition television 
janice obuchowski who heads a commerce department agency that 
oversees government radio use warned of the costs and potential 
disruption to military and emergency communications and air traffic 
control if federal users relinquish frequencies as proposed in a 
bill by reps john dingell dmich and edward markey dmass 
there is no fresh and virgin spectrum and there will be some 
user displacement obuchowski told the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance she said the bush 
administration opposes the bill 
but alfred sikes chairman of the federal communications 
commission which regulates the commercial radio sector said the 
government if forced to do so can find ways to turn over parts of 
its spectrum to the private sector 
however he acknowledged that reallocation could be costly 
american technology so far has made major advances in squeezing 
more information onto the airwaves but there are limits to such 
advances sikes said 
some believe that we have reached theoreticl limits 
particularly when costeffectiveness factors are taken into 
account sikes said in all likelihood we will have to both 
move toward new generations of equipment at a significant cost 
and find more spectrum 
sikes said it was important to americas international 
communications competitiveness that the radio industry which 
generates more than 100 billion in revenues annually be able to 
grow 
obuchowski urged congress not to act before completion late next 
year of a spectrumuse study by the national telecommunications and 
information administration which she heads 
but dingell and markey told the hearing it was essential to move 
quickly dingell said that as the united states sits soundly 
asleep europe and japan are making great communications advances 
markey said congress had not held a hearing on spectrum use 
since 1959 and that technicians not policymakers had been 
making allocation decisions 
as a nation we should not be fretting over choosing between 
new important technologies such as highdefinition television and 
microcell communications and important community needs such as 
mobile communications for public safety

a good experience and the two new leaders could learn from each 
other 
krenz a communist party hardliner emerged smiling from the 
talks with mazowiecki a longtime solidarity activist and former 
political prisoner 
we had a very good talk we touched all subjects that concern 
the german democratic republic and the peoples republic of poland 
it was naturally a new experience for me to speak with the prime 
minister krenz said after the nearly onehour meeting with 
mazowiecki

with each other quickly find a way to solve all complicated and 
uncomplicated problems he added

relationship between the two countries and international issues 
mazowiecki said there was a good atmosphere during the meeting 
i think our conversation was open clear and made a tour of our 
problems 
krenz in power only two weeks and facing popular pressure at 
home for solidaritystyle reforms also met with president wojciech 
jaruzelski and with communist party first secretary mieczyslaw f 
rakowski 
asked what polish experiences he could use in east germany 
krenz replied i have only been here a few hours so i cant say 
concretely yet but nevertheless i said we learn from each 
other 
but he denied taking any advice from mazowiecki who became 
prime minister in august the prime minister is such a pleasant 
man that he didnt make any recommendations krenz said 
he told me how one should judge things but we did not give 
each other recommendations 
i hope we will have not only good neighborly relations but 
friendship as well krenz said we have had good traditions and 
i think we can continue those 
krenz said earlier at the airport that it was a great 
pleasure for him to meet mazowiecki the east blocs first 
noncommunist head of government 
it is a new experience for me but i think something good can 
come out of this experience for east germany he said

in what promises to herald a new era 
for hors doeuvres researchers have developed tomatoes that are 
half the size of cherry tomatoes 
no more cutting them up and getting squirted with the seeds 
you just sprinkle them on your salad like croutons 
the university of florida reported wednesday that two institute 
of food and agricultural sciences researchers developed tomato 
plants that stand 5 to 8 inches tall and produce the ittybitty 
microtom tomatoes 
theres nothing like it said dr jay scott who spent seven 
years developing the tomato with dr brent harbaugh it 
establishes a whole new category for small tomato varieties we 
call it a miniature dwarf tomato 
an average tomato plant is 20 times larger than microtom which 
was bred for convenience and as an ornamental for window sill pots 
hanging baskets and in garden borders microtom is about 
onequarter the size of the next smallest varieties said scott 
microtoms tiny tomatoes also taste good according to 75 
people who sampled the fruit in informal taste tests scott said 
but scott and harbaugh note that seeds for microtom are not yet 
available and probably wont be released to the public until 
sometime next year 
microtom is so intriguing because all the parts of the tomato 
plant have been genetically reduced in size scott said other 
dwarf tomato plants are short but their leaves are still 
comparatively large relative to the rest of the plant said scott 
scott and harbaugh crossbred a dwarf florida tomato variety 
called florida basket with an ohio breed that had small leaves and 
fruit to develop the pedigree for microtom

more than 1300 young east germans 
jammed the west german embassy on thursday to seek new lives in the 
west and many scoffed at promised reforms in the communist 
homeland they left behind 
in east berlin communist leader egon krenz urged closer 
economic ties to the west and said a new law permitting freedom of 
travel to the west would be announced monday several top communist 
officials resigned including the wife of ousted leader erich 
honecker 
at least 8000 east germans swarmed into czechoslovakia after 
east germany lifted a monthold travel ban on wednesday the 
official east german news agency adn said it is the only country 
east germans can visit freely 
most of those flooding into the embassy in prague were in their 
early 20s at least 200 to 300 children could be seen behind a 
fence playing peacefully in the embassy grounds 
we want reforms without borders said one of the new 
arrivals a 24yearold trucker from leipzig 
i dont believe that anything will change there said 
another young man who declined to give his name the reforms are 
only for the outside world 
as darkness shrouded the embassy east germans continued to 
arrive with at least 20 people gaining entry in just one 15minute 
spell 
the refugees simply walked in through the giant wooden doors of 
the palais lobkowicz the elegant baroque palace that houses the 
west german embassy in pragues ancient mala strana district 
a czech policeman outside the embassy said he and his colleagues 
had orders not to interfere with any east germans seeking entrance 
because this was a matter for the two germanys alone 
several refugees chatted with reporters through the railings of 
the embassy garden some sipping beer and listening to music 
others waved from upperfloor windows in the embassy 
shipments of tents were ordered from west germany to cope with 
what embassy sources expected would be a renewed influx over the 
weekend west german red cross helpers and medical supplies were 
dispatched from bonn 
east germany has agreed to allow east germans at the embassy and 
at the west german embassy in warsaw to renounce their citizenship 
and go to west germany which automatically gives them a new 
passport and assistance in starting a new life 
east german diplomats are processing only about 100 people a day 
in prague and more than 1000 are still waiting in the west german 
embassy in warsaw 
east german ambassador helmut ziebart urged his countrymen to 
seek legal emigration in east germany rather than go through other 
countries but many complained that it takes years for such 
requests to be granted 
west german coaches were used to ferry the processed east 
germans to the czech border with bavaria at waidhaus some east 
germans who boarded a bus thursday appeared rather drunk witnesses 
said 
czechoslovakias normally conservative staterun media which 
gave only scant reports on the exodus of 15000 east germans 
through prague last month swiftly reported the latest arrivals 
more than 70000 east germans have fled their homeland through 
hungary and bonns embassies in prague and warsaw since august 
on oct 3 honecker banned travel to czechoslovakia to try to 
halt the mass emigration of young skilled workers badly needed in 
his laborintensive economy 
but the exodus and pressure for reform led to honeckers ouster 
oct 18 krenz who is trying to bolster the communist partys 
sagging authority with promises of reform and foreign travel 
lifted the ban 
krenz faces mounting pressure for solidaritystyle reforms in 
east germany where tens of thousands have repeatedly taken to the 
streets to press for more democracy 
on thursday in warsaw he discussed reforms with polands 
solidarity prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the first 
noncommunist premier in the east bloc back in east berlin he 
told reporters he wanted closer ties with the european economic 
community and called for a quick trade agreement 
krenz spoke after talks with martin bangemann an eec 
commissioner from west germany bangemann said he was told by krenz 
that a new law permitting freedom of travel to the west would be 
announced on monday 
two regional communist party bosses were replaced the chief of 
the communistcontrolled trade unions federation stepped down and 
the leader of a communistallied political party resigned adn 
reported 
the resignation of margot honecker as education minister was 
announced by the staterun news agency adn following a cabinet 
meeting mrs honecker 62 had held the post since 1963

the senate closed its doors thursday to debate 
the case of judge walter l nixon of mississippi in the second 
impeachment trial to come to the floor in the last two weeks 
lawmakers were expected to vote friday on whether to remove the 
61yearold us district court judge 
nixon was convicted in 1986 of lying to a federal grand jury 
investigating reports that he intervened with a local prosecutor on 
behalf of a defendant in a marijuana smuggling case he was 
incarcerated at eglin air force base in florida last year and 
recently moved to a new orleans halfway house 
nixon says witnesses lied at his trial and biased prosecutors 
held him to an unfair standard of accuracy in his testimony with no 
leeway for error 
if convicted nixon would be the seventh official ever removed 
through impeachment and the third judge ousted from the federal 
bench in three years 
alcee l hastings of florida was removed as a district judge two 
weeks ago for conspiracy to obtain a 150000 payoff in return for 
reducing the sentences of two defendants to probation and then 
lying about it under oath 
reporters and spectators were shooed out of the galleries as 
lawmakers prepared to debate the impeachment charges against nixon 
the closeddoor debate came after final arguments wednesday from 
nixon defense attorney david stewart and house members who play 
the role of prosecutors in impeachment trials 
the house approved three articles of impeachment by a vote of 
4170 they charge that nixon lied to the grand jury and also in an 
interview with the fbi and another representative of the justice 
department 
conviction on any of the charges by twothirds of the senators 
present and voting would automatically remove nixon and halt the 
89500 salary he has continued to collect otherwise he says he 
would like to return to the bench and preside over trials again

the nations manufacturing productivity 
improved at an anemic 14 percent annual rate in the third quarter 
with output gains at a threeyear low and unit labor costs rising 
at the fastest rate since the 1982 recession the government said 
thursday 
the labor department said overall productivity in the nonfarm 
sector of the economy was up at an annual rate of 21 percent in 
the julyseptember period nearly double the revised 11 percent 
annualrate gain posted in the second quarter 
but that improvement was overshadowed by other data in the 
report suggesting that the manufacturing slump is far from over and 
that wage inflation remains stubborn despite a recent moderation in 
consumer price increases 
manufacturing is clearly soft said david wyss of the 
drimcgraw hill forecasting firm the economy is slowing down and 
that is going to be felt disproportionately by manufacturing 
added merrill lynchs donald straszheim manufacturing is not 
likely to improve much until well into next year 
the 14 percent annualrate gain in manufacturing productivity 
in the third quarter was off dramatically from the revised 
secondquarter improvement of 37 percent the thirdquarter number 
represented the smallest productivity increrase since the fourth 
quarter of 1987 
output in manufacturing was up just 13 percent at an annual 
rate in the third quarter its smallest gain since 1986 and 
hours worked in american factories declined 01 percent at an 
annual rate after falling a revised 02 percent in the second 
quarter 
september unemployment data showed a 103000 drop in 
manufacturing employment a sign to analysts that manufacturers 
were trying to cut costs and boost productivity 
but the outlook remains bleak for the next several months the 
analysts said because rising unit labor costs will exacerbate the 
already unfavorable position most us manufacturers find 
themselves in in world markets 
indeed the labor department said unit labor costs rose at a 
rapid 45 percent annual rate in the third quarter after falling at 
a revised annual rate of 10 percent in the second quarter it was 
the largest quarterly increase in unit labor costs in manufacturing 
since a 97 percent annual gain in the first quarter of 1982 
the overall numbers for the nonfarm sector were somewhat more 
encouraging but still underscored the recent economic slowdown and 
the persistent upward pressure on wages 
the 21 percent annualrate nonfarm productivity gain resulted 
from a 31 percent rise in output and just a 10 percent gain in 
hours worked the increase in hours worked was the lowest in more 
than three years 
hourly compensation in the entire nonfarm sector rose at an 
annual rate of 53 percent in the nonfarm sector down from the 
second quarter annualrate gain of 56 percent but still evidence 
of underlying inflationary pressures 
inflation is still a very serious problems said elliott 
platt a senior vice president and donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
the productivity gain helped offset the impact of wage gains on 
unit labor costs in the overall nonfarm sector they increased at 
an annual rate of 32 percent in the third quarter after rising at 
a revised 45 percent in the second quarter

montgomery county a washington suburb 
became the first county in the nation to have its own brand of 
booze when it introduced its county crest line in liquor stores 
gin rum bourbon vodka and scotch have been sold since last 
month under the label which features a knights helmet and shield 
that the county director of liquor control described as a 
knockoff of the county crest 
the county crest line was described by county executive sidney 
kramer as a marketing move to better serve county consumers and to 
make montgomerys countyrun liquor stores competitive with 
neighboring jurisdictions 
however virginia bright head of the county chapter of mothers 
against drunk driving called the action improper and in poor taste 
what kind of example are we setting for our young people by 
having the countys name the countys crest on alcohol she 
asked 
whats the big deal said county director of liquor control 
jerome i baylin noting that it is common for a large liquor store 
to sell alcohol under a private label we dont get them to 
drink they have already made the decision 
montgomery county is the only local government in the nation 
that controls the wholesale distribution of alcoholic beverages it 
provides beer and wine to retailers in the county and it has a 
monopoly on the sale of hard liquor four other counties in 
maryland have a less strict form of liquor control and 18 states 
have liquor control 
we walk a fine line baylin said basically we are here 
to foster moderation temperance and respect of the law but on the 
other side of it we are a revenuedriven agency here to offer a 
product to people who drink 
the county crest spirits produced by a baltimore distillery 
have been available for about a month and several managers of the 
stores said it is too soon to say how popular they will be 
they havent had time to really establish themselves said 
bob stover manager of a rockville store 
baylin said the products will appeal to bargainhunters for 
instance the 175liter bottle of county crest vodka costs 1095 
compared with 1139 for gordons 1369 for smirnoff and 2299 
for absolut 
the county crest spirits are supplied by majestic distilling co 
of baltimore

israel is trying to develop a hydrogen bomb 
according to a classified pentagon report that supports widely held 
suspicions about israels nuclear weapons capabilities 
but israels efforts are being slowed in part by a deadlock 
among us agencies over whether to allow two israeli research 
institutions and the governmentowned israel military industries to 
buy supercomputers according to the report and to experts on 
nuclear proliferation 
published reports over the past 10 days that israel helped south 
africa develop a ballistic missile that could carry nuclear 
warheads are expected to reduce israels chances of acquiring such 
computers said experts and sources familiar with the case 
an interagency team has been debating the request for 
supercomputer export licenses to israel brazil and india for two 
years supercomputers are manufactured only in the united states 
and japan and their export from this nation must be approved by 
the federal government because they can be used in weapons 
production 
selling supercomputers to countries that may be pursuing 
nuclear weapons or longrange ballistic missiles would be an 
extremely illadvised move sen john glenn dohio said this 
week 
gary milholin an expert on the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
and a law professor at the university of wisconsin said if the 
united states grants israel a license for a supercomputer the 
likelihood of its being used to make missiles and bombs is very 
great 
a report prepared in april 1987 for the department of defense 
said israel was developing the kind of computer codes which 
will enable them to make hydrogen bombs 
however the israelis do not yet have the capability to carry 
out these kinds of calculations for the necessary codes 
according to the report prepared by the institute for defense 
analyses 
as far as nuclear technology is concerned the israelis are 
roughly where the us was in the fission weapon field in about 
1955 to 1960 the report said 
israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons although the 
government refuses to confirm or deny this 
research is being conducted at two nuclear facilities one near 
the negev desert town of dimona and the other at the sorek facility 
south of tel aviv according to the report which was made 
available to the associated press 
the report said the sorek center works in close 
collaboration with hebrew university the university is one of 
the three israeli institutions seeking to buy a supercomputer said 
another source 
the other two are the technion institute of technology and 
israel military industries 
one source who was privy to the interagency deliberations 
until recently said technion and hebrew university have both 
offered guarantees that the machines will be used only for academic 
research purposes 
its really a question of how much you trust israel said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
proponents of the sale argue that it is beneficial for us 
manufacturers and that israel could develop nuclear bombs without 
the supercomputer although it would take longer 
technion in a pamphlet to its supporters said a project 
taking one month on a supercomputer would require over eight years 
on the equipment currently available 
critics of the supercomputer deal argue that israel india and 
brazil should not get the machines because they have not signed the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty which seeks to prevent the export 
of nuclear weapons technology 
south africa recently tested a mediumrange ballistic missile 
built with israeli help us officials say israel is also helping 
south africa develop a longrange missile similar to its own shavit 
threestage rocket according to the officials

vidalia onions will be available at 
thanksgiving for the first time this year thanks to a new storage 
technique that puts georgias famous edible bulbs to sleep for up 
to six months in a controlled atmosphere 
the only problem is vidalia lovers will need to be in north 
florida to put their hands on the sweet things 
but the new storage technique is expected to become more 
widespread by next growing season and the one farmer now using the 
procedure estimates that within three to five years he will have 
enough competition to make the onions available nationwide at least 
four months of the year 
grower wj grimes has been using his 100000 nitrogen storage 
warehouse since june but on thursday held an opening ceremony 
the sweet hybrid which under state law can be grown only in 
specified areas near vidalia with lowsulfur content soil normally 
cannot be stored for long periods 
grimes placed about 350000 pounds of his vidalias in the 
special warehouse in june and has kept them stored at 34 degrees in 
an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide 3 percent oxygen and 92 
percent nitrogen 
the controlled atmosphere puts the onions to sleep 
the low temperature and the humidity keep them from rotting 
sprouting or rooting while the low oxygen keeps them sweet and the 
high carbon dioxide keeps the onions from getting pungent said 
doyle smittle the scientist who developed the process 
nitrogen storage could generate an additional 100 million a 
year for growers he said 
we have the potential to have onions year around said 
smittle a horticulturist at the university of georgias coastal 
plain experiment station in tifton we need to finetune the 
system we know we can store them for six to seven months we just 
dont know about 12 months 
besides generating extra profits for georgias 260 registered 
growers and packers he said it also should improve the overall 
quality of the 30millionayear crop because some growers now 
harvest immature vidalias to get a jump on the season 
last season vidalias fetched for their growers 20 to 25 a 
50pound bag early in the sixweek season but within three to four 
weeks the price had dropped to 10 to 12 a bag 
smittle said he believes nitrogen storage will stabilize prices 
and give the industry more control over the supply 
i personally think its going to increase the total 
consumption of onions he said im sure there are people out 
there like me who when they cant get a good vidalia onion quit 
eating onions 
the consumer should benefit from the more controlled marketing 
season of vidalias grimes said because it will cut down wild 
price swings he said a consumer who pays 89 cents a pound for the 
onions then sees them a week later for 39 cents a pound feels 
cheated 
grimes sold all his onions to a major grocery chain in florida 
youll have to go to north florida if you want one smittle

an appeals court thursday formally 
dismissed the case against the man convicted of killing prime 
minister olof palme but left a cloud of suspicion hanging over him 
police said they would continue to hunt for evidence against 
christer pettersson a career criminal who was arrested in december 
for the 1986 shooting 
the state attorney has until nov 30 to appeal to the supreme 
court but the court normally would agree to review the case only 
if a question of legal principle were involved 
the appeals court ruled that pettersson likely was the man seen 
outside a movie theater where palme was slain and dismissed his 
alibi but it said it had not been proved that he killed the 
swedish leader 
pettersson 42 could be tried again if further evidence is 
discovered before the 25year statute of limitations takes effect 
legal experts said 
the svea court of appeals was unanimous in overturning 
petterssons july 27 conviction by the stockholm district court 
which had sentenced him to life imprisonment 
on oct 12 the appeals court freed pettersson from jail pending 
publication of the full written judgment on thursday 
it cannot be considered proved that the perpetrator is 
identical with christer pettersson therefore the court leaves the 
indictment unsanctioned the appeals court said 
palme who was prime minister for 11 years and scandinavias 
leading international figure was shot while walking home from a 
movie with his wife lisbeth 
pettersson is still a suspect with us ingemar krusell a 
senior investigator was quoted as saying by the national news 
agency tt 
he said the police had formed a special squad focusing on 
finding evidence against pettersson while two other teams puruse 
other possible leads 
the lower court convicted pettersson in a split decision 
largely on mrs palmes identification of pettersson she testified 
that she was absolutely certain he was the man she saw when she 
looked up from her dying husband 
the appellate court stressed she saw the gunman for a brief 
moment in poor light and said the fact that lisbeth palme was 
upset can have affected her ability to carry out exact 
observations 
the court also pointed to the gap of almost three years before 
she first identified pettersson in a videotaped police lineup 
the verdict cited the 1976 british study by the devlin 
commission which cast doubt on the reliability of witness 
identification 
no one should be sentenced on the base of identification 
unless that evidence is supported by other forms of proof the 
court said 
the court noted the lack of technical evidence especially the 
murder weapon believed to be a 357caliber magnum 
it said there was no proof pettersson had any experience with 
guns and pointed at the investigations failure to establish a 
motive 
pettersson who has a long criminal record and a history of drug 
abuse has maintained his innocence and said he admired the 
socialist prime minister 
during the first year of the palme investigation which was the 
largest manhunt in swedish history police pursued several 
conspiracy theories implicating ones involving kurdish militants 
the iranian government and even an alleged cabal of swedish police 
all were found baseless 
several government commissions condemned the conduct of the 
investigation as bumbling and sloppy and several reputations were 
destroyed by the case 
in june 1988 justice minister annagreta leijon was forced to 
resign for giving her support to a private probe of the murder 
which bypassed official authorities

system

tadeusz mazowiecki the east blocs first noncommunist leader 
krenz called it a good experience and said they could learn 
from each other 
he told me how one should judge things but we did not give 
each other recommendations krenz said 
we spoke openly with each other and those who speak openly 
with each other quickly find a way to solve all complicated and 
uncomplicated problems he said

for the fourth time in a week us officials 
protested the large chinese police presence outside the us 
embassy and the harassment by guards of staff and visitors an 
embassy source said thursday 
also thursday china said former president richard nixons visit 
will help restore badly strained relations with the united states 
but it insisted again that the blame lies with washington 
in the us capital state department spokesman richard boucher 
said incidents of harassment are unacceptably intrusive security 
activity and we have protested this and previous actions to 
chinese authorities both in washington and in beijing 
the embassy source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
latest verbal protest came wednesday hours before another night of 
provocations outside ambassador james lilleys residence 
on wednesday night about two dozen uniformed police and at 
least 10 plainclothes police congregated outside the gate to the 
residence shining a spotlight and forcing visitors to go through a 
gauntlet of armed guards 
twenty other policemen were posted on nearby streetcorners and 
along the street in front of the compound turning some cars away 
and forcing those going to the embassy to park hundreds of yards 
away even though there were many empty spaces near the gate 
when visitors tried to park closer to the embassy police banged 
on their cars and yelled at them to leave 
police cursed at a cbs crew that tried to photograph them and 
they shined another spotlight into the crews camera 
a similar massing of police occurred tuesday evening only then 
they were armed with automatic rifles and did not carry spotlights 
in an apparent gesture to nixon the peoples armed police 
around the three us embassy compounds did not carry rifles 
wednesday for the first time in four months 
nixon aides said the former president told premier li peng he 
did not like guns and did not want to see rifletoting guards when 
he visited the embassy 
on thursday guards continued to wear pistols and eight black 
or gray mercedes sedans some without license plates and with what 
apparently were plainclothes police inside again were parked along 
the street outside the ambassadors residence 
the embassy also has complained of three cases of embassy staff 
findig their car tires slashed and security forces tailing embassy 
employees as they left the compounds 
twice in the past week armed police outside the embassy pointed 
their automatic rifles at children of us diplomats and pulled the 
trigger an embassy source said the guns were not loaded 
during a halloween party at the embassy on saturday the arrival 
of people wearing costumes apparently rattled the chinese at least 
80 police were called in seemingly to block chinese fugitives from 
sneaking into embassy grounds police became particularly upset 
when partygoers arrived carrying a fake coffin 
one man who came to the party dressed in a gorilla suit was told 
to park his car elsewhere 
premier li reportedly told nixon that the heavy guard most 
embassies have only one or two chinese police posted outside was 
necessary to prevent the escape of dissidents fang lizhi and his 
wife li shuxian who took refuge in the embassy after the june 4 
military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
fang and li wanted by chinese police as counterrevolutionary 
agitators remain in one of the embassy compounds 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing asked about the police 
harassment at a weekly briefing thursday said china always 
attached importance to the safety of the foreign embassies in 
china 
li said nixons fiveday visit which ended several before the 
briefing will undoubtedly be conducive to the restoration and 
development of the normal relations 
but he said it is imperative for the united states and 
actually the united states only to take the initiative in 
improving ties 
washington cut off highlevel contacts with beijing after the 
crackdown when chinese troops killed hundreds of unarmed 
civilians it has urged china to end repression against those who 
advocate democratic reform 
nixon aides said he will present an account of his visit to 
president bush

soldiers and highway equipment from 
across the state are bolstering a retooled effort to remove piles 
of debris that have littered roadsides of north carolinas largest 
city since tropical storm hugo 
with residents getting impatient and the fire hazard increasing 
the city last week backed off a plan initiated by the federal 
emergency management agency to turn over the entire cleanup to 
private companies 
immediately after the sept 22 storm hundreds of city and state 
workers cleared streets but they returned to their regular jobs 
and the city began seeking contractors to remove the debris that 
continued to pile up in front of nearly every home in this inland 
city of more than 350000 people 
many of the bids were considered too high others too low to 
ensure the businesses could complete the job one bid came in at 
48785 and another at 18 million for the same job involving a 
section of charlotte 
it became obvious we werent going to get moving said 
pressley beaver the city official in charge of the cleanup we 
had a lot of highly reputable contractors tell us they werent 
going to shoot craps and roll the dice thats why so many came in 
so high 
on monday about 330 state department of transportation workers 
and 250 city workers began a citywide cleanup using such heavy 
equipment as frontend loaders and dump trucks their efforts are 
to supplement the businesses whose bids were accepted in a cleanup 
expected to cost 15 million most of which will be paid by the 
federal government 
its up to crew supervisors to decide how each area is cleaned 
up 
we are under emergency conditions beaver said weve got 
a huge volume of dry debris and the lack of rain has produced a 
substantial threat of fires 
the patience of residents is being tested beaver 
acknowledged theyre getting tired of it 
officials have been saying all along that it could take until 
spring to complete the job 
thats not much consolation to residents like peggy malley 
its a hazard she said looking at the large pile of tree 
limbs in front of her house ive watered it down a couple of 
times but its still awful dry 
i know these things dont happen all the time but its been 
more than a month she said 
according to city officials more than 2 million cubic yards of 
debris or 200000 truckloads were left along the citys 3000 
miles of curbs thats enough to fill a 60story skyscraper three 
or four times 
some residents could see progress this week 
on wednesday eight soldiers from fort bragg about 100 miles 
east pulled in front of 84yearold hazeline hinkles small brick 
home in less than 30 minutes they removed the oak that flattened 
her garage 
i really appreciate what theyre doing said mrs hinkle a 
widow whose insurance did not cover all of the damage to her home 
of 52 years i need a new roof my bedroom leaks and my garage is 
in pieces 
for the team of soldiers it was their eighth job in less than 
two days sixtytwo fort bragg soldiers had volunteered for the 
duty 
theres no better feeling in the world than being 
appreciated said spec aaron smith of columbus miss i only 
wish we could do more 
the united way of the central carolinas is coordinating the 
volunteer effort to clean up the yards of elderly poor and 
disabled residents 
the organization has received more than 2100 requests for 
assistance with the help of 60 to 70 volunteers a day about 800 
yards have been cleaned and united way officials are begging for 
more volunteers and equipment 
progress has been somewhat slow but there are reasons for 
that said vivian hamilton of the united way many wouldbe 
volunteers are still cleaning up their own back yards 
still her concern for the needy was foremost 
many of the elderly and handicapped people calling in feel 
like theyre deserted she said we try to assure them that 
well get there

what to give santa claus the man who truly 
has everything for christmas why not his own zip code 
so the us postal service has done it giving santa the zip 
code of 303511989 thats the number boys and girls can use when 
they address their letters to the jolly old elf 
children always have been able to write to santa without even 
that much of an address and they still can the postal service has 
ways of getting those letters to him or some of his volunteers 
scattered around the country somehow most letters get answered 
often with toys if the child appears needy 
now however the cocacola co is trying to give a boost to the 
tradition of writing to santa and got the postal people to 
cooperate with 30351 which happens to be in the atlanta area where 
coke is and not the north pole where santa is 
to make things easier the company is putting form letters on 
the sides of some of its cartons 
the softdrink maker said postal service spokesman ray jacobs 
is donating 5 cents for each of the first 2 million letters it 
receives to the marine corps reserves toysfortots program 
we dont want people to think they have to buy cartons of coke 
to send letters to santa jacobs said

senators made clear thursday they want house 
members to join them in disclosing mass mailing costs but refused 
to force the issue in order to avoid scuttling a deal to cut the 
taxpayerfinanced mailings in half 
senators voted 6435 to table in effect to reject an 
amendment by sen gordon humphrey rnh that would have required 
the house disclosure 
sen harry reid dnev warned that the house would reject a 
conference agreement to cut mass mailings from six to three 
annually per member if senators attempted to change house rules 
reid the chief senate negotiator of the mail reduction 
agreement said that while he and other senators fought earlier for 
humphreys plan for quarterly disclosure they were unwilling to 
jeopardize the compromise now 
we have gotten from the house all were going to get said 
reid the conference we had with the house was brutal the house 
had the feeling we should clean up our house before we tell them 
what to do 
humphrey however argued we have to say were not going to 
be blackmailed i suggest we have the guts to stand up to the 
blackmail of the house 
the vote was the latest development in the continuing debate 
over changing one of lawmakers favorite perks mailings usually 
newsletters addressed to postal patrons throughout their 
states or districts the mailings always rise in an election year 
because they are considered a great advantage to incumbents 
members of each house however have used the mail debate to 
threaten changes in the way the other chamber does its business 
senators dont like the idea that only their rules require 
disclosure of mailing costs by each member the house objects to 
senators use of money from honoraria political action committees 
and party campaign committees for office expenses 
while the house has approved the conference agreement with the 
mass mail reductions the senate debate is continuing it was 
unclear when the senate would decide to either accept the agreement 
or buck the issue back to the house 
in addition to the mass mail reductions the conference 
agreement would establish for the first time separate house and 
senate mail accounts limit the size of newsletters to two sheets 
of paper establish a voluntary procedure for keeping mail costs 
within their budget and strictly enforce a prohibition against 
postal patron mailings 60 days before an election 
the compromise would budget 1002 million for mailings 
including 445 million for the house 239 million for the senate 
and the remainder to pay the postal service for mailings that 
exceeded the fiscal 1989 mail budget

security laws apparently were 
broken at a rally honoring freed leaders of the african national 
congress and prosecution could result president fw de klerk 
said thursday 
de klerk also said the anc remains committed to violence and 
terrorism and will not be legalized until it drops its commitment 
to an antigovernment guerrilla campaign 
the president addressing a military parade said that at the 
huge proanc rally sunday there occurred what appeared to be 
contraventions of existing laws but he did not elaborate 
speakers at the rally including four of the freed guerrilla 
leaders endorsed their movements use of violence and some quoted 
exiled anc officials both violations of security laws 
de klerk said police were preparing a dossier for the attorney 
general so he can decide whether to prosecute an added law and 
order will be maintained 
the seven freed african national congress leaders were released 
unconditionally on oct 15 but their guerrilla movement remains 
outlawed 
de klerk said the free prisoners must guard against being 
misused by those seeking continued confrontation they would also 
be wise to steer away from imflammatory rhetoric 
de klerk said further major political changes were needed to 
resolve south africas racial conflict he gave no specifics 
thursday but has said previously that additional steps under 
consideration include lifting of the state of emergency and release 
of nelson mandela the bestknown anc leader who remains in prison 
mandela is widely expected to be freed within the next few 
months justice ministry spokesman dirk de villiers described as 
just speculation a report thursday that tentative plans were 
being made for mandela to be released in january 
constitutional development minister gerrit viljoen assigned by 
de klerk to draw black leaders into negotiations said in a 
television interview that the rally sunday had exposed the anc 
for what it is an organization that openly flaunts its 
association with the communist party 
the flag of the outlawed south african communist party was 
draped behind the podium at a soccer stadium near johannesburg 
where more than 70000 people gathered

more than 300 police commanded by 
algerian officers will guard a parliament meeting to elect a 
president under terms of a peace plan opposed by christian leader 
gen michel aoun security sources said thursday 
sources in moslem west beirut said the session scheduled for 
saturday may be postponed for a few days to give christian 
parliamentarians a last chance to convince aoun to back the arab 
leaguebrokered plan 
but the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
meeting will take place before tuesday in compliance with the 
accord approved by parliament at a special session in taif saudi 
arabia last month 
the accord aimed at ending a 14yearold civil war shifts 
political power to the moslem majority revamping a political 
system formed in the 1940s when christians were the majority aoun 
says the plan lacks a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of 40000 
syrian troops backing moslem forces 
aoun who heads the christian cabinet in lebanons dual 
government has threatened to dissolve the 99seat house if it 
convened to elect a speaker elect a head of state and ratify the 
national reconciliation charter to which he is opposed 
no one officially has declared their candidacy for president 
although two parliamentarians have said they would run they are 
elias hrawi from east lebanon and rene moawwad of north lebanon 
both maronite christians 
aoun has called christian parliamentarians who approved the 
accord traitors most christian politicians militia commanders 
and spiritual leaders also have backed the accord 
in his latest statement thursday he stopped short of repeating 
a threat to dissolve parliament but he said continuing with 
such constitutional violations and hypocrisy would force us to take 
decisive measures to safeguard the constitution 
he did not specify what he planned to do 
lakhdar ibrahimi assistant seceratrygeneral of the 22nation 
arab league told the newspaper annahar that arrangements have 
been completed to secure a onemile radius neutral zone around 
villa mansour the proposed venue of saturdays debate in the 
nomans land of beiruts dividing green line 
reached later at the summerland hotel in west beirut ibrahimi 
said the area will be patrolled by the lebanese police under the 
supervision of nine algerian officers who arrived earlier in the 
week for that purpose 
ibrahimi an algerian would not give other details 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified in line with 
regulations said the lebanese force will comprise 300 men and be 
deployed on friday evening if no postponement of the session is 
announced 
the whole police force in beirut will be on alert to provide 
backup if needed he added 
the peace plan emerged after 23 days of wrangling on political 
reforms sought by moslems and the christians demand for a fixed 
timetable for a syrian troop withdrawal from lebanon 
the moslems obtained some concessions mainly an increase of 
parliament seats to 108 divided equally between christians and 
moslems and a cutback in the powers of the christian president to 
give the parliament speaker and prime minister traditionally 
moslems a wider share in the decisionmaking process 
under an unwritten covenant dating from independence from the 
french in 1943 the president is a maronite the prime minister a 
sunni and the parliament speaker a shiite 
but aoun complained the accord referred only to a phased syrian 
withdrawal from the beirut region in two years without any 
commitment for a total pullout 
the syrians maintain its troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate 
twentyeight parliamentarians have refused to return home after 
the taif meeting fearing action against them by supporters of 
aoun they gathered in paris 
on thursday they agreed to send two representatives george 
saadeh who heads the largest christian political group the 
phalange party and kazem khalil to meet with aoun before saturday

a landlord was sentenced thursday to 
one year in prison in the deaths of two men trapped inside a 
burning apartment house by a locked corridor door 
frank thomas who installed the lock that violated safety codes 
at the request of tenants appeared shaken by the sentence 
although he could have received up to eight years in prison 
i wished it didnt happen he told state supreme court 
justice nicholas colabella i tried to help them the tenants 
and make them comfortable im sorry this thing happened 
thomas 68 of new rochelle was convicted sept 18 on two 
counts of criminally negligent homicide 
eight people were killed in the jan 15 fire at the yonkers 
apartment building where thomas was landlord state supreme court 
justice nicholas colabella convicted thomas in only two deaths 
because the charred bodies of the men were found behind the door 
which locked from both the inside and the outside 
thomas said he installed the lock because tenants wanted to keep 
nonresidents out of the building 
the fire started by the careless smoking of a resident in a 
basement apartment spread rapidly because there was no fire door 
between the basement and first floor another code violation 
authorities said 
relatives of the fire victims have sued thomas 
colabella said thomas was not the typical slumlord you were 
attempting to keep the building in your own way habitable even 
though it resulted in the building not being safe 
colabella said the city of yonkers was a party to the 
tragedy since thomas was not cited for various code violations 
and the building had not been inspected regularly 
thomas will remain free on 5000 bond pending appeal

five kgb officers sat under the harsh lights 
thursday for a questioning that touched on some of the soviet 
unions most sensitive secrets 
the five were not accused traitors nor were they among the 
feared secret services counterintelligence officers trying to 
wring out a confession 
they were answering questions from the soviet public in a 
firstofitskind nationwide callin program at a soviet tv studio 
if the spokesmen for the five kgb departments didnt reveal how 
many agents are working abroad as diplomats or trade 
representatives how many have been killed or defected in recent 
years nor the size of the kgb budget they at least showed off the 
kgbs new atmosphere of openness 
today the kgb is not asking the questions national tv 
commentator vladimir tsvetov said opening the 75minute program 
that preceded the evening tv news today they are being asked 
questions 
questions from around the country taken by a group of telephone 
operators seated behind the panel were written out and read by 
tsvetov that eliminated the possibility of direct exchanges 
between the officers and their questioners 
questions touched the personal lives salaries and living 
conditions of kgb officers details of the secret services foreign 
activities as well as charges of its activity inside the soviet 
union 
svetlana matviyenko a vocational school student from 
leningrad asked about the romantic toughguy image of the spy as 
portrayed in the james bond movies 
we wouldnt like our agents to have even the smallest part of 
these qualities thats why its just ridiculous to speak about the 
likeness between a soviet secret agent and james bond said maj 
gen anatoly bondarev of the kgb personnel department 
responding to another question bondarev acknowledged that a few 
soviet spies have defected in recent years causing serious 
political and moral damage 
they deserve the most severe punishment he added but we 
are principally opposed to passing a verdict in abstentia and 
principally opposed to summary punishment 
asked if any kgb officers were punished personnally for 
hounding nobel peace prize winner andrei d sakharov or exiled 
nobel literature laureates alexander solzhenitsyn or josef brodsky 
during the 1960s and 1970s col alexander karbainov spokesman for

afghan guerrillas on thursday 
rejected peace talks with the kabul government as suggested in a 
resolution adopted by the un general assembly 
we see the resolution as the same as last year said 
najibullah lefrey minister of information of the afghan 
governmentinexile in neighboring pakistan where many of the 
guerrillas are based 
the un document adopted by consensus wednesday calls for an 
intraafghan dialogue for the establishment of a broadbased 
government to ensure immediate participation of all segments of 
the afghan people 
the insurgents armed mainly by the united states and pakistan 
have been fighting the sovietbacked kabul government for 11 years 
we dont believe it means the puppet regime should have any 
involvement in the talks said lefrey referring to the ruling 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan which seized power in a 
bloody 1978 military coup that sparked the insurgency 
the pdpa has no support so how can it be included in a 
broadbased government he said 
an official of the pakistan foreign ministry which drafted the 
un resolution in consultation with moscow acknowledged the call 
for intraafghan dialogue was not new but he said this one differs 
from last years document by calling for a ceasefire and for a 
solution to the conflict that recognizes the islamic character of 
afghanistan 
the guerrillas known as the mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors aim to make afghanistan an islamic republic 
intraafghan dialogue is quite vague said the pakistani 
official on condition he not be identified by name the soviet 
side may interpret it as comprising all sides including afghan 
president najib and the peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
but the guerrillas have refused to accept either najib or his 
party in a postwar government 
the resolutions call for a cessation of hostilities also is 
open to interpretation the official said 
kabul and moscow have said they want a ceasefire first 
followed by efforts to find a political solution mujahedeen have 
refused to lay down their arms until najib and his party are out 
there have been compromises on both sides to reach a consensus 
resolution said the pakistani official how else do you 
achieve a consensus 
the united nations in 1988 brokered an agreement that provided 
for the withdrawal of some 103000 soviet combat troops from 
afghanistan completed in february of this year the red army 
intervened in 1979 to fight the mujahedeen and to replace one 
communist government with another

the house opened debate on comprehensive oil 
spill legislation thursday with members skirmishing over regulatory 
powers for states and liability limits for industry 
debated for more than a decade but given momentum by the exxon 
valdez disaster the proposed legislation would establish a federal 
liability and compensation system for damages caused by oil spills 
in navigable us waters 
the bill has broad support but debate has focused on a 
provision that would bar state governments from setting tougher 
liability standards than those in the federal legislation 
also contested is a provision that would make those responsible 
for spills fully liable for damages if grossly negligent 
environmentalists are pushing an amendment to establish liability 
for simple negligence a lesser standard 
it simply makes no sense especially now with prince william 
sound still contamined by oil to preempt the right of state 
governments and state legislatures to protect their own people 
in the way they feel is best said rep gerry studds dmass 
but rep norman shumway rcalif said the federal standards 
would be tough enough on oil spillers and that preemption of state 
laws would ensure a single comprehensive system 
without preemption we are going to have a patchwork of 
confusing duplicative and sometimes competing laws that cause 
delays and in fact do further damage to the environment because of 
the confusion shumway said 
studds has said he will offer an amendment to delete preemption 
from the bill votes on pending amendments and the bill itself were 
postponed until next week 
rep george miller dcalif is expected to offer an amendment 
to change the bills liability threshold from gross negligence to 
simple negligence 
shumway said he would fight the amendment describing the bills 
gross negligence standard as a tradeoff with the oil and gas 
industry which under the bill would pay for a 1 billion cleanup 
fund 
the bush administration supports the bill and says it will 
oppose the studds and miller amendments 
if enacted the bill would establish a fund for spill cleanup 
financed through a tax on domestic crude oil and imported petroleum 
products the fund would cover damages to natural resources injury 
to real and personal property profits and earning capacity 
a 1986 law provided for a 13 centsperbarrel oil spill tax 
but the house voted this year to boost it to 3 cents 
the bill would toughen penalties for oil spills and require the 
president quickly to mobilize federal resources in the event of a 
major spill seven regional strike teams would be established to 
provide fast cleanup assistance

metal plaques have been placed over the 
engraved words colored and white on two courthouse 
fountains ending months of public controversy that generated 
national interest in the issue 
the plaques which read simply jones county courthouse 1908 
were bolted to the two fountains on the lawn by order of the board 
of supervisors 
as long as the wording is not visible were going to back 
off said manuel jones president of the local chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people if 
the wording is invisible we dont have to explain to our kids what 
colored means 
local and national naacp leaders had been fighting since january 
to have the words covered or the nonworking fountains removed 
when the county board of supervisors began exploring the issue it 
was deluged with calls from constituents saying that the fountains 
were a part of the towns history and they didnt want them removed 
county workers plastered over the words in early april only to 
have the plaster washed away by months end by heavy rains 
something should have been done way before now jones said 
wednesday a day after the plaques were attached it just brought 
a whole lot of publicity jones county didnt need and that the 
state of mississippi didnt need 
before deciding on the plaques the board of supervisors 
considered uprooting the fountains from the lawn and sending them 
to the state department of archives and history in jackson for 
museum display however constituents requests to leave the 
fountains there prevailed 
the plaques meet the criteria of historians for careful 
preservation said elbert hilliard director of the archives

region thursday and some miners blocked shipments in an effort to 
force the government to keep promises of improved living and 
working conditions 
tass said eight of 13 mines in vorkuta joined the strike at the 
largest the vorgashor and miners at nearby inta voted to walk out 
friday the official news agency did not say how many miners would 
strike at inta 
representatives of miners in the nations main coalproducing 
region the donets basin of the ukraine met on thursday to decide 
whether to strike 
soviet officials say a drop in coal production could force 
rationing of heat and light in the long severe russian winter

government make good on pledges of better conditions that convinced 
thousands of miners to resume work in july at pits they had closed 
in the arctic ukraine and siberia

fulfillment of some of the points of the resolution things remain 
unchanged in the mining areas tass reported

hungarian reform leader imre pozsgay said 
thursday that president bush views the upcoming mediterranean 
superpower summit as advancing cooperation in central europe and 
around the world 
pozsgay speaking with reporters after a 30minute oval office 
meeting with the president also said bush promised to review trade 
restrictions that currently keep hightech products from being 
shipped from the west into hungary and other sovietbloc nations 
bush already has announced a major relaxation of trade barriers 
with hungary including extension of mostfavorednation trading 
status to reward recent political reforms there 
hungary declared itself a democracy two weeks ago and pozsgay is 
a presidential candidate in elections to be held there later this 
month 
pozsgay who holds the title of minister of state said bush 
briefed me on what were his motivations regarding the summit 
he assured us that the whole region and european cooperation 
and global cooperation could benefit from that and naturally it 
would be very benefical and advantageous to hungary pozsgay said 
all central european nations can only profit from the 
strengthening of eastwest relations that the december summit 
signifies pozsgay said through a translator 
pozsgay sidestepped a question on whether he would try to take 
hungary out of the warsaw pact if he is elected president 
my view is that this is a global european problem that could 
be resolved the best way by the elimination of both blocs the 
north atlantic treaty organization of western countries and the 
warsaw pact 
asked whether bush had done enough for hungary he said i 
believe he has done what he could 
the white house issued a statement saying that during the 
meeting bush restated his commitment to the success of hungarys 
democratic reforms stressing that our support is for the process 
of change rather than for any particular party or candidate

the speaker of the polish parliament said 
thursday he told senior bush administration and congressional 
officials that further delays in economic aid to poland could help 
topple the solidarity government 
the situation is rather dramatic said mikolaj kozakiewicz 
a leader of the peasants party and marshal of the lower house of 
the polish sejm or parliament kozakiewicz said he urged us 
officials to move more quickly 
solidarity leader lech walesa is expected to convey much the 
same message during his scheduled visit to washington this month 
the peasants party last summer split from the communist party 
coalition in parliament opening the way for solidarity activist 
tadeusz mazowiecki to form the first noncommunist government in 
eastern europe since world war ii 
kozakiewiczs party remains in the solidarity coalition 
although there are differences over some policies 
congress has appropriated 100 million for food that is en route 
to poland but further aid is stalled over republican efforts to 
attach to the polish assistance bill an unrelated amendment to cut 
the us capital gains tax 
democrats have proposed sending poland and hungary 989 million 
in aid over three years while the republicans have proposed a 585 
million package 
in a related development thursday president bush met with 
hungarian reform leader minister of state imre pozsgay bush 
restated his commitment to the success of hungarys democratic 
reforms the white house said 
kozakiewicz met wednesday with deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger and on capitol hill with two sponsors of the 
polish aid package senate majority whip alan cranston dcalif 
and sen paul simon dill 
cranston and simon appearing at a luncheon for kozakiewicz on 
wednesday said they were continuing efforts to pass the aid 
package 
after the meeting with eagleburger the state department said 
the two men discussed the current political and economic 
situation in poland as well as the role of foreign assistance from 
the west in helping poles implement their economic programs 
kozakiewicz speaking with reporters thursday at the polish 
embassy avoided commenting on wrangling between the administration 
and congress 
but he repeatedly criticized western governments for not moving 
fast enough to get aid to poland in the pipeline 
all the major countries are all the time elaborating their 
programs but not sending aid he said west germany has also 
pledged a major aid package but details may not be clear until 
chancellor helmut kohl visits warsaw next week he said 
the delays mean that we will be sitting in the middle of 
winter with the situation getting harder and harder 
the delays dishearten those poles who traditionally trust the 
west and prompt malicious joy among those who do not trust the 
west he said 
most poles still wish success for the first noncommunist 
government in poland since world war ii but they are running out 
of food heating coal medical supplies and other necessities 
kozakiewicz said 
in addition to sending aid to poland the administration has 
authorized the us overseas private investment corporation opic 
to insure american businessmen seeking to invest in poland the 
insurance would protect americans against the risk the polish 
government would change and expropriate their investment said opic 
spokesman james v hall 
fred m zeder president of opic will lead a delegation to 
poland on monday to review 250 projects there that need private 
investment said hall about 25 companies are expected to send 
representatives with zeder

congressional negotiators on thursday approved 
a 305 billion defense bill that slashes 11 billion from 
president bushs strategic defense initiative and eliminates one 
b2 stealth bomber 
the plan the product of nearly eight weeks of wrangling between 
house and senate conferees provides much of bushs request for 
landbased nuclear missiles and restores some funds for two 
conventionalarms programs the president sought to kill 
defense secretary dick cheney said he was generally pleased 
with the bill because it authorizes funds for effective 
modernization of our strategic forces he expressed some 
disappointment however over the cut in the sdi request 
i would have preferred a higher level of funding for sdi 
the defense secretary in australia for bilateral talks said in a 
statement released by the pentagon 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said he expects the president to sign the bill 
once it passes the house and senate 
apart from sdi on the whole its one which we find 
acceptable warner said of the bill 
the legislation provides 357 billion for sdi popularly known 
as star wars in the fiscal year that began oct 1 about 200 
million less than the amount spent in fiscal 1989 and the first 
decrease in funds since former president reagan proposed the 
antimissile shield six years ago 
adding 220 million for related energy department programs the 
final total for star wars is 379 billion which falls between the 
28 billion approved by the house and the 43 billion adopted by 
the senate 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said the cut in star wars spending reflected diminishing 
congressional support for a program whose mission the bush 
administration has not defined 
theyve changed the program so many times and the architecture 
has never been really a fixed architecture by that i mean the plan 
and how theyre going to use it nunn told reporters 
despite the overall agreement there still were complaints from 
lawmakers about the package 
were buying too many bigticket items with no hard choices 
said rep john kasich rohio a member of the house armed services 
committee who complained aobut the restoration of funds for the 
v22 osprey and the f14d jet fighter 
what we have to show for weeks of wheeling and dealing in 
conference is an outrageous compromise corrupted by political and 
parochial avarice said rep larry j hopkins rky 
the negotiators agreement which still must be approved by the 
full house and senate includes approximately 11 billion for the 
railbased mx multiplewarhead missile and the truckbased 
midgetman singlewarhead missile about 150 million less than bush 
had requested for the two nuclear weapons 
cheney had favored financing only the mx but bush opted for the 
two landbased missiles with 11 billion for the mx and 100 
million for the midgetman 
the bill also includes house language imposing a 50missile cap 
on the mx 
the budget for the mx and midgetman drew complaints wednesday 
from four house members including three chairmen of armed services 
subcommittees 
we feel that the proposed deal on the b2 strategic defense 
initiative and mobile icbms is inadequate and we cannot sign the 
conference report in its present form the four said in a letter 
to rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services panel 
signing the letter were reps charles bennett dfla and 
chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on seapower and 
strategic and critical materials patricia schroeder dcolo and 
chairman of the subcommittee on military installations and 
facilities ronald dellums dcalif and chairman of the 
subcommittee on research and development and lane evans dill 
and a member of the full panel 
the agreement also provides funds for two b2 stealth bombers in 
fiscal 1990 one less than the bush administration proposed and 
money for components for five in fiscal 1991 the batwinged 
aircraft has come under congressional criticism in the last year 
for its expensive price tag of 530 million apiece 
the negotiators agreed to restore some money for the two 
conventionalarms programs bush sought to cancel the marine 
corps osprey tiltrotor aircraft and the navys f14d tomcat 
the osprey an aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can 
fly like a plane will receive about 255 million in research and 
development money but no funds for procurement the future of the 
program would be tied to commercial use of the plane 
the legislation also includes a provision calling for the 
purchase of 18 f14d fighters in fiscal 1990 but none in fiscal 
1991 a decision which is viewed by many lawmakers as a golden 
parachute for the manufacturer grumman corp of new york 
while the future of the osprey rests with commercial 
application the bill requires grumman to sign a contract to end 
future production of the f14d referred to by warner as a poison 
pill

the united nations resumed relief flights 
from kenya to southern sudan thursday after a 24hour suspension 
following the bombing of a rebelheld town 
four people were killed in tuesdays bombing of yirol in sudans 
southern bahr el ghazal province 625 miles southwest of the 
capital khartoum a un source said 
the sudan peoples liberation army clandestine radio said the 
government bombed the town and swore revenge on the nations 
military strongman lt gen omar hassan elbashir 
the spla assures elbashir that his indiscriminate and 
barbaric bombing of yirol will not go long unpunished the radio 
said every warmongering madness of elbashir will be quickly 
met by a swift ironfisted retaliation that will cost the regime 
another garrison town 
it said four civilians were killed and six civilians wounded 
the un source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
flights from lokichoggio in northern kenya suspended wednesday 
resumed after safeguards were implemented involving radio contact 
with relief personnel in southern sudan and assurances the planes 
would be met on arrival 
the planes are part of a uncoordinated operation that has 
moved 107000 tons of food and supplies into southern sudan since 
april in an effort to avert a repeat of last years tragedy when an 
estimated 250000 people died of starvation 
until last week government forces and rebels had observed a de 
facto ceasefire in their nearly 7yearold war in southern sudan 
to facilitate movement of relief supplies 
however hostilities appear to be on the rise the yirol bombing 
came four days after rebels seized a town on ethiopias border 
following days of fighting

the pentagon said on thursday that it informed 
congress of a 31 billion arms purchase by saudi arabia touching 
off a 30day period in which capitol hill can reject the deal 
the sale which was reported in the media several weeks ago has 
touched off little opposition among lawmakers 
in the past congress has rejected several us arms sales to 
arab countries out of concern for israels security 
but political maneuvering in recent weeks managed to diffuse the 
concerns that customarily touch off strong opposition to us deals 
with arab countries technically at war with israel 
the sale of this equipment and support will not affect the 
basic military balance in the region the pentagon said in a 
statement 
it includes 315 m1a2 tanks but twothirds of the price tag 
which is equivalent to a years us aid to israel is the cost of 
equipment and ammunition including huge trucks to transport any 
tanks that break down 
the sale also includes the design and construction of 
maintenance facilities for the vehicles the pentagon said 
the statement did not say where the tanks would be based 
several house members have written secretary of state james a 
baker iii asking further consultations and raising some questions 
about the sale and baker promised to provide assurances the arms 
were necessary for the saudi defense 
with the formal notification congress has 30 days either to 
kill the deal by majority votes in the senate and house or let it 
go through 
the saudis are to receive the tanks beginning in the middle of 
the next decade about the same time the us army would field 
them israel has a comparable tank the merkava 
to smooth congressional approval the bush administration agreed 
not to equip the saudi tanks with plates of uranium armor a much 
denser metal than steel 
if some are deployed at the tabuk military base the tanks would 
be only 120 miles from israel others may be based near kuwait and 
still others at an armored training school near mecca

nicaraguan forces were responsible for the 
deaths of 74 contra supporters in the northern part of the country 
between 1987 and early 1989 a human rights group said in a report 
released thursday 
americas watch a private group based in new york also said 
sandinista authorities were to blame for the disappearance of 14 
others thought to support the rebels 
on the other hand americas watch said in a separate report that 
the claim by state department and nicaraguan opposition groups that 
5000 to 7000 nicaraguans are being detained for political 
offenses is patently false 
the report said the total of such prisoners is not significantly 
greater than the 1306 estimated by the international committee for 
the red cross last august 
americas watch which often has been critical of abuses by the 
nicaraguan contras in previous reports said the sandinista record 
in investigating the alleged killings is mixed 
some cases have resulted in convictions and punishment but 
others have not the report said 
according to the report americas watch researchers discovered 
20 other possible killings in addition to the 74 but it said the 
information on these cases was incomplete 
it said the vast majority of the killings took place in the 
remote mountains of northern nicaragua 
the concentration of so many cases in a particular geographic 
area in this period led us to conclude that these killings 
constituted a pattern and could not be dismissed as isolated or 
sporadic it said 
the pattern indicates that regional military or security forces 
engaged in selective kidnappings and assassinations of persons 
suspected of being contra collaborators or couriers it said 
in most cases bodies were found within hours or days and in 
many cases those corpses showed signs of brutal torture the 
report added

the national right to life committee said 
thursday that television stations have refused to air commercials 
it has produced attacking the democratic candidate for governor in 
virginia 
spokeswoman nancy myers said the ads were rejected by eight 
virginiaarea stations including five that are airing opposing ads 
produced by the national abortion rights action league 
the rejected ads attack virginia democratic nominee douglas 
wilder who has made his opposition to restrictions on abortion a 
central focus of his campaign along with his contention that 
republican opponent marshall coleman wants to take away womens 
rights to choose the ads endorse coleman 
the election is tuesday 
ms myers contended that the ads were factual and said officials 
at the stations gave outrageous reasons for refusing them 
among the reasons she said was that they objected to the tone of 
the narrators voice in one case and to an assertion that 
wilders campaign was based on the abortion issue 
these stations are saying that we cant talk about the issue 
of abortion unless we use the other sides terminology and 
rhetoric she said thats television censorship and its 
outrageous 
a third ad describing colemans opposition to abortion has been 
accepted by several of the stations as have general ads on the 
abortion issue that do not directly address the virginia governors 
race said executive director david osteen 
john long executive vice president and general manager of wjla 
in washington said his television station rejected the ads because 
the group had not provided substantiation to our satisfaction 
for their assertions 
theres just an awful lot of inference too much inference in 
those spots long said weve asked them to substantiate where 
do they get those facts if they supply the facts well put 
them on the air 
ms myers said the group intended to spend 150000 airing the 
ads because of the refusal she said they will probably air 
100000 worth the ads are being aired on seven stations plus some 
cableonly stations she said 
the abortionrights group naral has aired 300000 worth of 
ads attacking colemans antiabortion position spokeswoman loretta 
ucelli said 
she said the abortionrights group was refused airtime on some 
washington stations that reject advocacygroup ads in general and 
that other stations required written substantiation of the facts 
stated in the ads 
we went through the process and they accepted them ms 
ucelli said

the parents of a boy run over and killed by 
the school bus he had been riding moments before appealed to 
congress thursday to prevent the deaths of other children who stray 
into blind spots not covered by the drivers mirrors 
as sure as im standing here there will be another child run 
over by his school bus because he couldnt be seen before this 
year is ended thomas peterson of howell mich told a house 
subcommittee 
we cannot believe that any school system would risk the lives 
of children for the sake of the extra dollars that adequate mirrors 
would cost said peterson whose 6yearold son matthew died in 
1984 after he walked in front of his school bus and was struck as 
it pulled away 
peterson and his wife kathy appeared before the house energy 
and commerce subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials 
to urge passage of a bill sponsored by rep dennis eckart dohio 
giving the federal government a deadline for toughening standards 
for school bus mirrors 
those standards now require only one mirror reflecting one foot 
in front of the bus most states require two mirrors 
even with two mirrors however theres a large blind spot 
where a driver is unable to see a child directly in front of the 
bus and on either side of it if he is within a foot of the vehicle 
eckarts bill would require special mirrors that eliminate 
blind spots the mirrors he and manufacturers estimate would 
cost about 100 per bus 
jeffrey miller acting administrator of the national highway 
traffic safety administration said the legislation is unnecessary 
because the agency has already begun revising the rules to improve 
a drivers visibility and require swingout stop sign 
attachments now mandatory in 28 states 
new standards could be in place in 14 months miller told the 
hearing 
but the chairman of the panel rep thomas luken dohio said 
thats not good enough and the federal agency hasnt acted fast 
enough 
nhtsa is inherently inately lethargic he told miller i 
think your comments here are that youre going to continue to be 
lethargic 
a member of the national pta board told the panel her meetings 
with the nhtsa left her convinced the agency didnt consider the 
issue a top priority nhtsas attitude was one of a big yawn 
insensitive and apathetic said millie waterman of mentor ohio 
today were going to wake nhtsa up promised luken 
on average 26 children are killed and 470 children are injured 
each year in the moments after getting off a school bus according 
to a report issued in may by a research arm of the national academy 
of sciences in each case the children walked ran or chased a 
dropped object near the bus but outside the drivers field of 
vision 
mrs watermans husband harry told lukens subcommittee that 
when he was in charge of transportation for mentors public schools 
he installed stateoftheart mirrors for about 100 a bus that 
erased driver blind spots 
the mirrors make the area in front of the bus and underneath the 
front bumper visible to the drivers

israeli officials said thursday they found 
positive movement in changes the united states made in its 
proposal for negotiations between israel and palestinians 
government spokesmen said prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
other leaders would meet friday to discuss the changes which 
israel radio said included assurances that known plo members would 
not be allowed to participate 
president hosni mubarak of egypt the only arab nation to sign a 
peace treaty with israel conferred in cairo with yasser arafat 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
when the plo has developed a position on the us plan he said 
egypt will sponsor it in our talks with the united states and 
israel 
arafat did not comment on the us plan but praised mubarak for 
offering to host palestinianisraeli talks in cairo a proposal 
that israel has rejected 
we thank and support the initiative that president mubarak 
proposed about holding a palestinianisraeli dialogue in egypt in 
preparation of an international middle east peace conference later 
god willing arafat said 
in the occupied west bank israeli soldiers shot an 18yearold 
palestinian to death fellow arabs in a prison camp killed a 
36yearold palestinian suspected of collaborating with israeli 
authorities the army said 
in the gaza strip a military jeep struck wadieh ali salem deeb 
28 as he was riding his bicycle arab reports said the army 
confirmed deeb later died in shifa hospital but said none of its 
vehicles were involved in the accident 
israeli soldiers or civilians have killed at least 608 
palestinian since an uprising began 23 months ago in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip and 40 israelis have died fellow arabs 
have killed 139 palestinians most of them on suspicion of 
collaboration 
secretary of state james a baker iii agreed wednesday to some 
changes in the us plan for preliminary peace talks between israel 
and palestinians 
israel radio said the new version included assurances against 
plo participation and acceptance of israels right to boycott the 
meeting if it did not accept the members of the palestinian 
delegation 
in washington a state department official confirmed privately 
that baker telephoned foreign minister moshe arens on wednesday to 
discuss the plan which israel had rejected 
he looked at the wording and may have made some changes but 
he didnt change the basic thrust the official said if that 
makes it more welcome then good 
bakers objective is to convene a preliminary meeting between 
israel and palestinians to revive an israeli proposal that calls 
for elections in the occupied territories to choose representatives 
to negotiate limited autonomy with israel he suggested the meeting 
take place in cairo 
avi pazner an adviser to shamir said the prime minister would 
meet on friday with arens defense minister yitzhak rabin and 
finance minister shimon peres 
an israeli government official said on condition of anonymity 
the fact that israels view was taken into consideration is proof 
there is movement and it is positive 
the changes appeared to fall short of israels requests in a 
letter to baker last week arens said israel wanted the right to 
veto individual members of the palestinian delegation and limit the 
talks to the israeli election proposal 
it seems to me the situation is better when it comes to 
wording then it was said ehud olmert a government minister from 
shamirs likud bloc that doesnt mean we should jump to 
conclusions that everything is fine but it certainly makes it 
easier 
the 18yearold killed thursday in the west bank was identified 
by the army as nasser swati halima of beit awwa the army said he 
was masked and burning tires at the towns entrance soldiers 
ordered him to stop 
the youngster tried to throw a backpack toward the officers 
who shot toward his legs the army statement said 
it said the other killing occurred in the ketziot military 
prison in the negev desert the army identified the victim as jabr 
ahmad nimer sider of gaza city and said his attacker was an 
18yearold palestinian from gaza 
palestinians in the occupied lands closed their shops thursday 
and and transportation was halted by a strike called by the islamic 
fundamentalist movement named hamas or zeal 
it marked the anniversary of the 1917 balfour declaration in 
which britain called for a jewish national homeland in palestine

gen manuel antonio noriegas government on 
thursday protested the appointment of a new chief of mission at the 
us embassy saying the diplomat was not accredited 
the foreign ministry statement also said several american 
diplomats are on an irregular status in panama 
the protest followed the announcement that john bushnell former 
deputy chief of mission at the us embassy in argentina has been 
named charge daffaires at the us embassy 
bushnell 59 a former staff member of the national security 
council and former deputy assistant secretary for interamerican 
affairs also served in colombia the dominican republic and 
switzerland 
he replaced john maisto who has been named the alternate us 
representative to the organization of american states 
the statement mentioned bushnell by name and said his status and 
those of other american diplomats is irregular since their 
function is to represent a government with which panama does not 
maintain normal relations 
the united states has refused to recognize the government since 
february 1988 when federal grand juries in florida indicted 
noriega on drug trafficking and money laundering charges and issued 
warrants for his arrest 
the united states imposed economic sanctions and has exerted 
diplomatic pressure to remove noriega from power 
soon after the indictments president eric arturo delvalle fired 
noriega as defense forces chief but the noriegacontrolled 
national legislature dismissed delvalle instead the bush 
administration has maintained that delvalle is panamas legitimate 
head of state 
maisto was accredited three years ago so the issue did not come 
up until his replacement by bushnell earlier this week 
the united states withdrew ambassador arthur davis to protest 
noriegas cancellation of the may 7 national election in which 
international observers said opposition candidate guillermo endara 
defeated the government candidate by a landslide 
on sept 1 noriega named francisco rodriguez a close friend 
as provisional president 
opposition groups insist that endara won and should become the 
next president

the inventor of an ultrasound gun used to stun a 
racehorse in an alleged plot to launder drug money through sure 
bets testified thursday he was told it would make his fortune 
i had someone tell me that if i had a device like this i 
would not have to work again auto dealer james laming told a 
criminal court this was someone fairly high up in the racing 
world and the gambling game 
laming 49 would not name the man who he said had no direct 
involvement with the weapon 
he was giving evidence 16 months after the thoroughbred ile de 
chypre veered suddenly across the track while leading an important 
english race apparently stunned by an ultrasonicsound gun 
disguised as a pair of binoculars 
the sound emitted from the grandstand inaudible to humans 
stunned the horse and caused it to toss veteran jockey greville 
starkey 
prosecutors say the ultrasonic device was the centerpiece of a 
plan in which narcotics profits would be laundered at tracks 
through bets guaranteed by use of the gun 
laming denies charges of cocaine possession and conspiring to 
distribute the drug he claims his association with confessed drug 
peruvian drug dealer rene black was based only on the invention 
earlier in the trial the court was told how lamings brother 
standing at the grandstand rail used the device on ile de chypre 
during the king george v handicap at ascot on june 16 1988 the 
horse was leading by three lengths less than 150 yards from the 
finish 
jonathan goldberg lamings lawyer told the court tuesday the 
plan was to undermine the the entire system of racecourse betting 
and bookmaking in this country 
on thursday laming was asked what that meant 
it meant taking out a horse he said 
asked whether he understood what would be achieved by taking out 
one horse in a race laming said i thought it would have 
advantages for the betting 
prosecutor andrew mitchell asked laming how he interested black 
in the device when the inventor himself did not appear to 
understand how it could be used in betting 
i am not one for theatrical performance but i believe the 
fact that the device was unique helped laming replied he was 
extremely interested in the fact that i could take out horses 
he also said black was a former show jumper and thought of 
reviving his own career by using the gun against competitors

the states corrections chief said 
thursday the warden of a prison rocked by two nights of rioting 
last week would not be paid during his suspension but he refused 
to comment on the disciplinary move 
the suspension of robert m freeman came hours after the 
associated press reported wednesday that according to guards 
prison officials had ignored broken cell locks after the first 
night of violence 
commissioner of corrections david s owens jr refused to 
elaborate on what prompted the suspension freeman a 19year 
veteran of the corrections system who has headed the prison since 
1984 could not be reached for comment he has an unlisted phone 
number 
but owens said thursday that freemans suspension will be 
without pay and will run until a special governors commission 
reports its findings on or before dec 1 
prison spokesman kenneth robinson would not say whether the ap 
report was related to the suspension 
the fiery rioting left more than a dozen buildings destroyed at 
the prison five miles west of harrisburg thirteen prison staffers 
were held hostage at various points during the two riots a total 
of 123 people were injured 
the mediumsecurity prison was calm and locked down thursday 
the corrections department said in a statement 
guards told the ap this week that during the first riot inmates 
removed metal covers from lock control boxes that run along the 
walls above each tier of cells the next night inmates reached out 
of their cells and pushed twoinch levers in the boxes to free 
themselves allowing the rampage to start anew guards said 
since last friday about 877 inmates have been transferred to 
other state and federal prisons another 50 inmates were to be sent 
thursday to the federal penitentiary at lewisburg pa 
when the riots first broke out the prison was nearly 45 percent 
over capacity with 2600 inmates in a 52acre complex intended for 
1820 
about 20 relatives of camp hill inmates met with prison 
spokesman robinson on thursday and sought either visits or answers 
to questions about the inmates robinson said visits were 
impossible some families later met with an aide to gov robert p 
casey 
sen stewart j greenleaf chairman of the state senate 
judiciary committee which grilled owens for answers on tuesday 
said he was surprised that freeman had been suspended so soon after 
owens told the committee he couldnt answer questions about the 
riots 
either owens didnt reveal all information or he didnt bother 
to take steps to find out said greenleaf hes got easier 
access to those guards than the ap or our committee 
greenleaf said he was bothered that owens would not give guards 
blanket freedom to testify the senator said guards were worried 
about their jobs and owens would not promise that guards could 
testify without fear of being disciplined 
prison spokesman john a palakovich said he could not comment on 
the guards allegations because an investigation is pending 
sen jeanette reibman a member of the state senate judiciary 
committee which questioned owens about the riots said she agrees 
with the suspension 
if what the guards are saying is so then on the basis of that 
knowledge the superintendent was suspended and that was the right 
action to take reibman said

treatment from the press but he stopped short of identifying race 
as the reason 
i dont know what the reason is coleman said during a 
heated 30minute news conference at the state capitol all i know 
is i see it because i am on the receiving end of it 
i dont think it matters how much history doug wilders 
election tuesday would make said coleman a former attorney 
general he has to meet the same high standards that virginians 
have always demanded of their governors 
laura dillard wilders press secretary said colemans remarks 
were offensive and will sicken the voters of virginia i am 
offended that marshall coleman is so desperate that he would 
suggest that 
ms dillard said wilder has been thoroughly scrutinized by the 
press i will leave it to others to conclude what is behind the 
doublestandard claim she said 
a poll published last weekend in the washington post showed 
coleman trailing wilder by 15 percentage points 
at the news conference coleman introduced the subject by 
saying many of you have asked me in recent days whether i think 
there is a double standard involved where mr wilder is concerned 
i will give you an answer he added 
coleman then listed seven points among them wilders reprimand 
by the virginia supreme court in 1978 for mishandling a case 
sponsoring legislation to pay money to a client who was threatening 
a malpractice lawsuit housing code violations by property wilder 
owned and charging fees for speeches to state groups after his 
election to the states no 2 office in 1985 
in such cases coleman said if he had been the offender he 
would be laughed out of the contest and not be in the 
running 
but for the most part members of the news media have treated 
these examples of dishonesty and corruption as minor foibles he 
said 
coleman called the news conference and invited wilder to attend 
to explain the tape which contains comments wilder made to united 
mine workers at a private meeting last summer 
on the tape wilder said he would support amending the states 
righttowork law which forbids compulsory union membership to 
allow labor contracts under which nonunion members would pay dues 
to the union that negotiated the agreement 
after the tape was released tuesday wilder said he would veto 
any effort to weaken the righttowork law and said the tape did 
not contradict that position 
coleman said the tape shows that wilder is so lacking in 
personal integrity that he would take two positions at once 
wilder who said he saw no need to attend the coleman news 
conference responded that he told the miners he would oppose any 
weakening of the righttowork law 
according to a transcript of the meeting wilder told the miners 
several times he supports the law and that there is no chance of 
repealing it but when he was asked whether he supported the 
proposed amendment wilder responded thats correct the 
transcript said 
wilder went wednesday to the college of william amp mary in 
williamsburg where he faced hecklers who shouted why do you 
lie at a student rally 
the handful of republican students in the crowd of several 
hundred students at the rally also carried signs that read doug 
your nose is growing and lies wilder and audiotape 
i didnt come here to answer mud wilder said between shouts

newspapers should join not fight telephone 
companies in the electronic publishing field a top federal 
regulator told a newspaper publishers meeting thursday 
alfred sikes chairman of the federal communications commission 
said newspapers could use their publishing experience to boost the 
nations telecommunications infrastructure and help assure that 
americans derive the same information age benefits that other 
nations are beginning to enjoy 
i think theres a good opportunity today for publishing 
companies to capitalize on their experience and move into 
electronic delivery of their product sikes told a meeting of the 
american newpaper publishers association 
obviously the american newspaper industry understands that 
videotext services will ultimately have a significant impact on 
your industry sikes said noting newspaper opposition to 
telephone companies providing such service i would like to 
suggest however that as lines of demarcation blur partnerships 
can often work better than rear guard actions 
electronic publishing includes computerbased data and voice 
messaging services and advertising programs such as electronic 
yellow pages 
the seven regional bell operating companies were barred in the 
1984 breakup of the american telephone and telegraph co from 
entering the socalled information services industry out of fear 
they would use their huge resources to kill competition 
but us district court judge harold greene who oversaw the 
atampt divestiture later said the bell companies may provide 
voicemessaging services and also act as gateways by providing 
single phone numbers that will reach multiple information service 
providers the bells still cannot offer the information services 
themselves 
the anpa opposes the bell companies entry into electronic 
publishing as long as the bells have monopoly control of the local 
telephone networks the anpa believes many of the bell companies 
have resisted fully developing the gateways in hopes of dismantling 
the lineofbusiness prohibitions in the 1984 atampt consent decree 
congress and the white house are considering whether to lift 
some of those restrictions on the bell companies and sikes during 
his confirmation hearings earlier this year told congress he 
supported lifting the lineofbusiness prohibitions 
major us electronic publishers already include knightridder 
dow jones and reuters and sikes in his address thursday said 
newspapertelephone company partnerships make sense since each 
would bring complementary talents to the bargain 
the underlying rationale of the many mergers in todays 
communications market is that there are real synergies available 
from product line to product line and by viewing software hardware 
and distribution assets as complementary he said 
sikes said european publishers such as frances hachette 
organization have been working with france telecom to develop its 
minitel videotext system he noted these companies already have 
entered the north american market in montreal and dallas where 
they should have something of a competitive edge already 
we want to make sure that americas leading firms have some 
degree of competitive parity sikes said 
it seems to me you might want to concentrate increasingly on 
helping assure a fair and rational regulatory framework within 
which this countrys full resources can be utilized sikes said 
there are logical options reasonably available here including 
efforts to blend the complementary talents of the publishing and 
telephone industries

austria said thursday it will ask 300 
million in damages from hungary which decided this week to stop 
work on a danube river hydroelectric project 
economics minister wolfgang schuessel said the halt was 
considered a breach of contract by the stateowned austrian 
contractor donaukraftwerke which was doing 70 percent of the work 
on the hungarian part of the 3 billion joint project with 
czechoslovakia 
he said the government would ask 4 billion schillings in 
compensation 
austrian state companies contracted to build much of the 
hungarian power complex at nagymaros in return for future power 
supplies 
tuesdays vote in the hungarian parliament to stop work which 
is near completion on the czechoslovak side came five months after 
hungary declared a moratorium because of mounting costs and fear of 
environmental damage 
czechoslovakia a conservative warsaw pact ally displeased by 
hungarys turn toward democracy also demands compensation its 
communist party daily rude pravo said thursday the decision to 
abandon the project is motivated not by ecological but mainly 
political reasons

a panel of the national academy of sciences 
has concluded there is insufficent scientific evidence to assure 
that oil can be produced off the california and florida coasts 
without harming the environment informed sources said thursday 
the report by a panel of the academys national research council 
is to be presented friday to a presidential task force reviewing 
oil leasing in federal waters off the coasts of the two states 
president bush who in his oil business days helped pioneer 
offshore exploration has held up a decison on whether to go ahead 
with leasing pending a review of their potential environmental 
impact 
according to sources familiar with the panels findings the 
panel has concluded that the existing data on the impact of oil 
exploration in the three areas it studied northern california 
southern california and the souther gulf coast area of florida 
are inadequate and not reliable enough to warrant a decision being 
made on whether to award leases 
the panel did not specifically recommend against oil or gas 
exploration in the three areas but said more scientific and 
technical data should be gathered before a decision is made one way 
or the other said the sources who spoke on condition that they 
not be identified by name or affiliation 
environmentalists have long opposed oil driling in the three 
areas 11 million acres of ocean off southern california another 
67 million acres off northern california and 14 million acres in 
the gulf of mexico near the florida everglades southern california 
waters already are an important production area but oil has not 
been found in the other two areas 
according to the sources who spoke on the condition that they 
not be identified by name the academys panel of scientific 
experts examined available data on what impact exploration in the 
three areas would have on the environment marine geography and 
nearby mainland economy 
the findings are expected to be a major victory for 
environmentalists and others who have opposed offshore oil 
exploration in the three areas 
if theyre saying this its a major swipe at those who are for 
drilling said lisa speer a staff lawyer for the natural 
resources defense council who has opposed offshore drilling 
when bush announced his drillijng delay in february he also 
asked the academy to examine available information on environment 
impacts of drilling as well as data on the potential for a major 
petroleum discovery 
the task force headed by interior secretary manuel lujan is to 
make a recommendation to the president by the end of the year

bells sirens and thousands of childrens 
voices rang out across two states thursday as both dakotas marked 
their 100th birthdays each was admitted to the union on nov 2 
1889 though residents continue to argue goodnaturedly about 
which really was first 
pony express riders carrying messages between the two states 
ran flat out trying to emulate the riding of their 
predecessors and the events of 1889 and other pioneer milestones 
were reenacted 
north dakota gov george sinner kidded his south dakota 
counterpart gov george mickelson after mickelson arrived a few 
minutes late for a morning radio show in which the governors wished 
each others states a happy birthday 
i thought it was appropriate that you got in a minute or two 
late sinner told mickelson we did some research and it turns 
out that north dakota was actually the first of these states to 
become states and so that minute or two was just exactly right 
officials said not even president benjamin harrison who signed 
the nov 2 proclamation that created both states knew which one 
came first even though north dakota was admitted as the 39th state 
and south dakota as the 40th 
president harrison really did kind of a wonderful thing when 
he shuffled those papers and didnt let anybody know who was 
first said jim sawyer assistant director of the south dakota 
centennial commission 
the president covered the papers up and then he said they 
were born together they are one and i shall make them twins 
then he shuffled them again and signed them even he doesnt know 
which one came first 
north dakota invited to the state capital more than 6000 
secondgraders scheduled to graduate from high school in the year 
2000 to join in song during festivities at the bismarck civic 
center 
the pupils helped in the official countdown to 340 pm the 
exact moment when north dakota became a state 100 years ago then 
balloons fell from the ceiling and the arena erupted into a 
boisterous round of happy birthday 
just think if everybody would have brought a present said 
david schaefer from new rockford gazing at a wall festooned with 
hundreds of birthday cards made by students around the state 
an arch fashioned of red white and blue balloons stretched over 
the stage which was flanked by the north dakota state seal and 
centennial logo 
it is a sense that we are bringing back a little history 
said one of the pony express riders ken tischmak of shields 
tischmaks horse firewater is a spanish mustang a descendant of 
the breed used in the original pony express he said 
we went all out he said we tried to do it as close as we 
could to the way they did it originally and when they ran it 
originally they ran flat out 
erma bohrer of napoleon arranged stacks of napkins as she 
prepared to serve cake and cupcakes to celebrants about 6500 
cupcakes were made plus eight large cakes decorated with north 
dakotas centennial logo 
im getting excited getting ready for a rush she said 
in south dakota watertown was declared capital for a day 
it was the home of the states first governor arthur c mellette 
state officials were on hand for a reenactment of mellettes 
swearingin ceremony abbreviated by subfreezing temperatures and a 
stiff wind the ceremony followed a parade from the restored 
mellette house 
this is wonderful terrific said mellettes 
greatgranddaughter mimi ide suverkrup of cedar pines park 
calif although i never met him arthur was always sort of a 
grand figure to me somewhat of a reserved but benevolent person 
the weather was slightly chillier than in 1889 with light snow 
and highs in the 20s over both states weather records show both 
states had highs in the 40s and 50s on nov 2 1889 said bill

antidrug abuse ads are making a big impact in 
areas where they are seen frequently according to a survey 
released thursday by a nonprofit coalition of advertisers that 
sponsors many of the ads 
the results prompted president bush to praise media leaders who 
have donated time and space for the commercials 
this group is at the leading edge of a powerful and moving 
effort debunking the big myth about drugs by deglamorizing them and 
deglamorizing their users bush told a white house gathering of 
more than 100 media executives 
the survey by gordon s black corp which was hired to conduct 
the poll by the mediaadvertising partnership for a drugfree 
america which produce and promote the ads found that marijuana 
use among adults in areas where the ads were shown frequently 
declined 33 percent in one year 
in areas where the ads were seen and heard more rarely the use 
dropped only 15 percent the survey found 
as for adult cocaine use it declined 15 percent in 
highfrequency areas compared with 2 percent in lowfrequency areas 
black who announced the findings to the media leaders said the 
margin of error for various parts of the survey of about 7000 
people ranged from onehalf percent to 4 percent 
black said one of the surveys discouraging findings was that 
one of every six children aged 9 to 12 is approached to buy or use 
drugs whether they live in the cities the suburbs or rural areas 
however the survey indicated that the percentage of such young 
people who said they had been offered drugs declined from 18 
percent in 1988 to 16 percent in 1989 the same level as 1987 
the survey also found that the percentage of children 912 who 
had tried marijuana rose from 4 percent in 1988 to 6 percent in 
1989 while the percentage of those who had tried cocaine or its 
smokeable form crack remained at 1 percent each for both years 
in addition black said attitudes among teenagers toward drug 
abuse showed only marginal improvement such attitudes improved 
among 13 year olds but not among those 16 to 17 the survey found 
the partnership aims to air 365 million worth of antidrug ads 
a year which calculates both the costs of the ads and the donated 
media time for a total of 1 million a day announced partnership 
chairman james e burke the former chairman and chief executive 
officer of johnson amp johnson co 
what were trying to accomplish is 1 billion over the next 
three years said partnership spokeswoman theresa venet grant 
that number provides about one antidrug message a day for every 
american each person will see or hear in one medium or another one 
antidrug message a day 
some critics have questioned the impact of antidrug ads 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television 
said in an interview thursday that although she was heartened by 
some of the surveys findings she was wary of them because the 
poll was financed by the group putting out the ads 
i hope this is right she said of the survey results i 
would be surer that it was right if the people doing the research 
had nothing to do with the people doing the advertising 
charren contends that the ads generally are conscience money 
for a society that is not taking care of that part of the 
population thats most likely to get involved in drugs 
this isnt all bad but i would worry about thinking this was 
the solution to the drug problem she said 
john condry a cornell university professor who has studied the 
ratio of prodrug to antidrug messages on television says the 
ratio is 8to1 in favor of prodrug messages including programs 
and advertisements showing people smoking drinking or taking 
overthecounter medicines 
what they are saying is if you dont like the state youre in 
if you have a headache you take a drug take some sort of 
substance to change how you feel condry said for a child 
its not clear theres a distinction between one drug and another 
a pills a pill 
burke whose former company makes numerous medications including 
tylenol pain medicine said i dont think theres any evidence 
to support that 
yet he added i have to agree that we are a society that 
somehow got ourselves into the fix of believing that if were in 
pain or have a problem take a pill and i would have to say that 
on an overall basis that can contribute to the problem what that 
suggests is those of us like johnson amp johnson who are advertising 
medicines have to be aware of that concern and i think our people 
are 
meanwhile the partnership has begun a 90 million public 
service advertising campaign aimed specifically at black youths and 
their parents 
the 11 television ads two of which are still in production 
plus 14 radio and two billboard ads were created by blackowned 
agencies that specialize in africanamerican markets grant said 
one called funeral home depicts a black mother packing a 
suitcase of clothes in which her son whom she knew was a drug 
user is to be buried another ad called new slavery likens 
drug addiction to slavery and a third called pushers plea 
depicts a black teenager thanking an unseen black parent for 
letting him get first crack at her children grant said

sandinista troops launched attacks in 
nicaraguas central and northern mountains thursday to try to wipe 
out outnumbered contra forces that have infiltrated from honduras 
according to reports 
lt col rosa pasos a military spokeswoman said most of the 
action was concentrated on rebels sneaking into nicaragua but she 
would confirm only one attack near quilali in the border province 
of nueva segovia 
president daniel ortega ended a 19month ceasefire on 
wednesday saying the contras had been stepping up attacks inside 
nicaragua he also blamed the united states for the renewed attacks 
and accused president bush of promoting terrorism 
bush on thursday appeared to reopen the possibility he may seek 
a renewal of us military aid for the contras saying we will 
leave our options open now that the sandinistas resumed military 
attacks 
the contras announced thursday they had accepted in principle a 
sandinista offer to meet monday and tuesday at the united nations 
to discuss demobilization roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo said he had also accepted an invitation 
in a communique the contras said they were still awaiting an 
official invitation from a unorganization of american states 
commission set up to verify central american peace accords 
the sandinista party newspaper barricada said thursday that 
combat units in 14 towns in northern nicaragua began operations 
overnight but neither the newspaper nor ms pasos gave details 
the contra communique distributed by the nicaraguan resistance 
in tegucigalpa honduras said the sandinistas mounted attacks 
wednesday with tanks helicopter gunships and heavy artillery 
ms pasos refused to comment and said she had no immediate 
reports on casualties or details of the fighting 
in tegucigalpa contra commander enrique bermudez said the 
contras would continue observing the ceasefire because they have 
not had the resources to launch attacks since us nonlethal aid 
was cut off in february 1988 
these troops will only carry out evasive actions said 
bermudez 
contra field commanders began moving their troops back into 
nicaragua from honduras after central american peace accords were 
signed aug 7 but said they would await the outcome of national 
elections set for feb 25 before deciding whether to launch 
offensive operations 
the accords called for voluntary contra demobilization in 
exchange for democratic reforms in nicaragua but the contras were 
not a party to the agreement and said they would not disband 
in washington the house of representatives voted 37929 for a 
nonbinding resolution denouncing ortegas resumption of military 
action against the rebels 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday it was 
unrealistic to expect the contras to lay down their arms when the 
leftist sandinista government is out to destroy them 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said the 
administration believes the contra reports that the sandinistas 
have commenced major military operations in at least two regions in 
nicaragua 
honduran president jose azcona hoyo urged ortega to reconsider 
his decision on the ceasefire ortegas decision is deplorable 
nevertheless i hope he meditates and rectifies it he said 
in tegucigalpa 
the hondurans also accused the sandinistas of attacking a 
honduran army post monday in the border town of las manos col 
manuel suarez benavides said there were no casualties 
a duty officer at the nicaraguan defense ministry said he wasnt 
familiar with the alleged incident and could not comment 
immediately 
ms pasos said most of the operations which started near the 
honduran border were in north and southcentral nicaragua 
ms pasos put the number of contra fighters inside nicaragua at 
2500 us estimates put it at 4000 and bermudez said there were 
more than 6000 they face the 70000member sandinista armed 
forces 
ms pasos accused the contras of using the ceasefire to bolster 
their positions and prepare for further attacks inside his country 
us officials earlier ruled out immediate resumption of 
military aid to the contras and the bush administration said it was 
consulting with central american leaders to bring diplomatic 
pressure on ortega 
nicaraguan government and contra representatives signed a 
temporary truce in march 1988 but when peace talks broke down 
three months later the sandinistas continued extending the 
ceasefire every month 
in a report thursday americas watch a private human rights 
group based in new york held the sandinistas responsible for the 
deaths of 74 contra supporters in northern nicaragua from 1987 to 
early 1989 and for the disappearance of 14 others thought to 
support the rebels 
but in a separate report it called patently false a claim by 
state department and nicaraguan opposition groups that 5000 to 
7000 nicaraguans are being detained for political offenses it 
said the 1306 estimated by the international committee for the red 
cross last august was nearer the mark

a general electric official acknowledged 
thursday that no records exist to prove a serial number mixup 
wasnt responsible for a faulty engine part placed in the united 
airlines dc10 that crashed july 19 
but james tucker general manager of the ge airplane engine 
plant in evendale ohio testified before federal safety 
investigators that company officials are certain that two fan disks 
numbered 00385 were not mixed up 
one of the disks was intended for the scrap heap while the 
other was approved for installation in a dc10 
a fan disk with that serial number broke apart in flight and is 
being blamed for the crash of united flight 232 as it made an 
emergency landing at sioux citys airport the crash killed 112 
people 
the fan disk was made in 1971 a national transportation safety 
board report found a tiny crack that experts say probably existed 
before the crash when ge pulled manufacturing records on the disk 
after the crash it discovered that two disks had mistakenly been 
given the same serial number in 1971 
one of those disks was deemed faulty after testing that year and 
was slated to be scrapped the other disk was sent on through the 
manufacturing process 
tucker said the two disks would have been stored in different 
areas of the ohio plant and were tested three months apart records 
show the part that failed ges testing was sent to another company 
for further testing and the flaw was confirmed tucker said 
but he acknowledged that no records exist to prove the companys 
claim that the two disks with the same serial number were not 
confused tucker said he too believes the two disks were not mixed 
up 
i made an analogy of a person being hit over the head and his 
wallet being stolen tucker testified thursday at the ntsb 
hearing into the crash 
and so somebody comes up to him and said show me what your 
name is and give us proof of who you are he cant do it but then 
they take him down to fingerprint him and then they find out who he 
is 
tucker said the second test that found a flaw in the same spot 
as the earlier test on the faulty disk is the fingerprint of that 
particular disk 
db robinson an accident investigator for the air line pilots 
association said thursday during a break on the hearings fourth 
day that questions about any serial mixup remain without adequate 
proof 
i dont think the records exist properly to answer that 
question right now he said 
im not satisfied but im not dissatisfied either 
robinson said the safety board will discover whats going on 
it will be resolved

mayor w wilson goode entered a hospital 
thursday for the second time in two weeks after experiencing an 
irregular heartbeat 
doctors said the mayors condition was not life threatening and 
he felt fine the 51yearold mayor will remain hospitalized until 
saturday for tests 
we believe it is an innocent type of heart irregularity which 
can be seen in individuals with normal hearts said his 
cardiologist dr edward s cooper 
from early wednesday to early thursday goode experienced three 
bouts of rapid heartbeats lasting from 30 seconds to several 
minutes doctors said 
the latest occcured at 5 am thursday while the mayor was being 
monitored in the hospital of the university of pennsylvania 
i have no idea yet what is triggering these rapid but normal 
heartbeats whether it is overwork or something i cant say right 
now cooper said 
goode first went to the hospital oct 20 after complaining of 
head and neck pain after tests another physician said goode had a 
normal heart and attributed his symptoms to sinus problems 
cooper said more tests will be taken before goode is discharged 
if we come up with nothing we have to assume it has something 
to do with his 16hour work days and maybe he should slow down 
cooper said

a tv entertainer and millionaire 
businessman who declared his candidacy for president just two days 
ago holds a wide lead among voters questioned about the race 
according to a poll released thursday 
lastminute entrant silvio santos a conservative running on the 
ticket of the small brazilian municipalist party was the choice of 
29 percent of the voters queried by the gallup institute 
the poll published in the newspaper o estado de sao paulo 
comes less than two weeks before the scheduled nov 15 election 
santos a former street vendor who has strong support among the 
poor declared his candidacy tuesday but still faces legal 
challenges 
the newspaper said the support for centerright candidate 
fernando collor de mello who had led the polls for six months 
plunged from 293 percent to 186 percent among those questioned 
the nationwide poll was conducted between oct 26 and wednesday 
with people interviewed at random in the street and their homes 
the margin of error was 3 percent 
santos candidacy still faces legal challenges before it can be 
registered with the supreme electoral court 
accusations have been made that santos a tv entertainer who 
owns more than 30 businesses paid off former municipalist party 
candidate armando correa to resign 
the court must also decide if santos violated a law that 
requires corporate directors to step down from their positions 
three months before declaring their candidacy 
santos who runs the sbt television network the nations second 
largest says he is a shareholder and not a director in the 
company and thus exempt from the law 
a ruling on santos bid may not come until nov 13 two days 
before the vote 
collor de mello whose base of support is with the rural poor 
was hardest hit by santos candidacy but other major candidates saw 
their support fall as well according to the poll 
rep luis inacio lula da silva of the socialist workers party 
came in third with the support of 106 percent of those questioned 
down from 124 percent in the last poll 
leftwing populist leonel brizola a former governor was 
fourth receiving 99 percent a drop of 28 percent 
mario covas of the brazilian social democratic party was fifth 
with 8 percent support down slightly from 82 percent in last 
weeks poll 
eight percent of those questioned were unsure who they would 
vote for and 56 percent said they would cast blank ballots 
gallup conducted a simultaneous poll that excluded santos from 
the presidential contenders 
without santos in the race 275 percent of those questioned 
favored collor de mello followed by da silva at 138 percent 
brizola with 127 percent and covas at 106 percent 
on nov 15 82 million brazilians are to choose a successor to 
president jose sarney for a fiveyear term the first popular vote 
for president since 1960 sarney was selected by an electoral 
college influenced by the military regime that ruled the country 
from 1964 to 1985 
if no candidate wins a majority nov 15 the two top 
votegetters will face each other in a runoff in december 
santos entrance into the race was criticized by left and 
rightwing candidates who agreed sarney was behind the maneuver 
the president has been harshly attacked by the campaigns leading 
contenders who blame him for 1300 percent inflation and 
corruption 
sarney by law cannot run for reelection

scientists said thursday they believe a 
previously unknown species of dinosaur has been found in the 
australian outback by a rancher who stumbled on a 
100millionyearold skeleton while herding cattle 
queensland museum officials said the son of a property owner 
discovered the fossilized skull of a 16foot pliosaur or 
shortnecked reptile sticking out of a creekbed after heavy rains 
three weeks ago 
mary wade the museums curator of palaentology called the find 
significant and said it was one of the best preserved ever found 
here 
it has been preserved even down to the tiny bones in its 
flipper she said it is not recognizable as anything we have 
seen in australia to date we are checking the literature but we 
think it might be a new species 
she said the complete skeleton was removed from a property near 
richmond in northwest queensland australias northern subtropical 
state and that the family did not want publicity 
the creature was a carnivore that lived in the inland sea that 
covered most of western queensland about 100 million years ago 
along with the remains were those of prehistoric fish and turtles 
believed to have been the animals prey 
to remove the fossils the team removed soil and rock from 
around them before wrapping them in plaster bandages the fossils 
were then removed in blocks to ensure they were kept in order 
the museum said the find eventually would be displayed

the senate judiciary committee on thursday 
approved a bill providing a temporary stay of deportations of 
salvadorans and nicaraguans in this country illegally after fleeing 
conflict in their home countries 
the measure won committee approval 113 and now goes to the 
senate floor 
the house last week approved a similar bill that also would 
provide a threeyear stay of deportations of chinese in the united 
states after fleeing the crackdown this summer against student 
democracy demonstrations 
that measure was sent to a subcommittee for further study 
the bill approved by the full panel contains no provision for 
staying deportations of chinese 
sen dennis deconcini dariz sponsor of the bill said it was 
needed to provide safe haven for citizens of the two central 
american nations who have not gained refugee status and to enable 
them to work in this country 
sen alan simpson rwyo who had been fighting the measure for 
more than two months relented on thursday but said he remained an 
opponent 
he said the murder rate in el salvador was lower than in the 
district of columbia and added that the real aim was to enable the 
aliens to get jobs he said this would undermine the nations 
existing immigration laws

session thursday to discuss ways to pay for earthquake relief 
including boosting the states sales tax in time for christmas 
shopping 
marilyn quayle meanwhile toured ravaged watsonville one of 
the farm communities south of san franciso that were among the 
hardest hit by the oct 17 quake the wife of vice president dan 
quayle has made disaster relief her personal cause 
im glad i came here and will certainly go back to washington 
and tell the president of the problems here now and the hardships 
that will be faced in the months to come she said 
sometimes its a lot harder for the smaller towns mrs 
quayle told mayor betty murphy as they walked past cracked and 
crumbling buildings that once formed the economic heart of the city 
of 28000 residents 
her visit comes a day after the san francisco bay area was 
rattled by yet another strong aftershock this one measuring 44 on 
the richter scale no serious damage or injuries were reported 
damages from the earthquake have been estimated at more than 
71 billion gov george deukmejian wants to raise 800 million 
for the states share of earthquake relief by raising the sales tax 
charged statewide by a quarterpercent from 6 percent to 625 
percent 
our state has pulled together like a family during this period 
of pain and suffering and i am personally very proud of the way 
our state has risen to the challenge deukmejian said in a 
written message to the legislature 
lawmakers convened about midday to weigh dozens of other 
measures aimed at helping the quake victims the session is 
expected to last two or three days 
deukmejian and the legislatures top four leaders agreed earlier 
this week to propose a 13month sales tax increase they want the 
tax to begin dec 1 and end dec 31 1990 to take in two holiday 
shopping periods 
any increase must be approved by twothirds of each legislative 
house while the state sales tax is 6 percent the total sales tax 
charged in some counties is higher because of locally levied sales 
taxes

oct 17 we need to make ourselves whole again said sen 
leroy greene as the special session opened 
mrs quayles first stop was in hollister a farming town of

objections by finnish security police 
scuttled a draft agreement between finland and the soviet union to 
waive visa requirements newspapers reported thursday 
the agreement was to have been signed here last week during 
soviet president mikhail gorbachevs state visit 
a report originating in the uusi suomi daily said negotiations 
broke down due to opposition from finnish police who feared 
security problems from an upsurge of soviet vistors and potential 
defectors 
instead the two countries last week signed a memorandum of 
intent to ease visa bureaucracy together with 30 other joint 
agreements it added 
the finnish consulate in the estonian capital of tallinn granted 
more than 32000 visas by oct 31 more than 10 times the 3000 
granted in 1988 
police declined to comment on the report 
foreign ministry official marita eerikainen said only that the 
question could still be reviewed 
the soviet union has not waived visa requirements with any 
western country but as perestroika continues there seems to be a 
real desire in the soviet union for a change in this policy 
eerikainen said 
eerikainen said a system of multiple entry visas already was in 
use for some categories of visitors such as business people and 
students

a new book alleges that sen edward m kennedy 
was involved in a another auto accident just prior to the 1969 
incident on a bridge at chappaquiddick but a kennedy spokesman 
thursday labeled the charge preposterous 
in a book released thursday to washington media author kenneth 
kappel said previously overlooked evidence indicates that kennedy 
may have pushed his black oldsmobile off the dyke bridge on 
marthas vineyard in massachusetts to cover up an earlier accident 
and to conceal his own drunken state 
kennedy spokesman paul donovan said the story is preposterous 
and absurd were not going to comment any further 
kappel said dents in the roof and side of the car shown in 
photographs could not have been caused by the vehicles impact with 
the water 
the accident that claimed mary jo kophechnes life occurred the 
night of july 18 1969 kennedy has maintained he had made a wrong 
turn in chappaquiddick and drove off the narrow wooden bridge over 
a salt water pond 
kennedy said he made several attempts to try to rescue kopechne 
and then enlisted the help of two aides he said at the time that 
the 10hour delay in reporting the accident resulted from his 
confused and distraught state 
the title of the book is chappaquiddick revealed what really 
happened

but i am thankful for this help because it will enable us 
peaceful reforms walesa said at his weekly news conference 
i urge everyone to produce food here he said for 
example it would be better if americans could send the equivalent 
in combines and machines and then the farmers could produce in 
poland 
walesa will be able to deliver his message in person next week 
when he leaves for his first trip to north america he will visit 
canada on nov 1113 and then go to the united states where he 
will address congress on nov 15 
president bush has been under pressure from democratic 
congressional leaders to increase the aid he proposed for the first 
east bloc country not led by a communist 
but walesa said he is going to the united states to gain 
friends and not to divide them and wont let himself be drawn 
into a political struggle 
right at the airport i am going to say i am coming here only 
to thank you and ask for understanding for the polish reforms 
please do not use me for election purposes and political aims 
because they are your own internal problems and not our problems 
walesa said the journey represents my most difficult trip 
while he intends to thank americans for their support over the 
years he said he also will try to urge the united states to turn 
their eyes to poland especially in the time of reforms and to 
take part in those reforms 
walesa who was not allowed to travel abroad for seven years 
after martial law was imposed to crush his independent union made 
his first foreign trip in 1988 to france 
since then he has visited several european countries and it was 
reported thursday he will go to britain on nov 29 at the 
invitation of the general council of the british trade union

soldiers killed at least 600 
libyanbacked guerrillas and seized grenade launchers and artillery 
in an attack on a rebel base near the border with sudan the 
foreign ministry announced thursday 
the battle monday left another 187 rebels wounded the ministry 
said in a statement there was no mention of casualties among 
government troops 
the attack followed two weeks of incursions into chadian 
territory by the libyan islamic legion supported by libyan leader 
col moammar gadhafi the statement said 
among the dead were adoum haggar and mahamat deleo former 
chadian military officers who sought refuge in libya following an 
unsuccessful attempt in april to topple president hissene habre 
the statement said 
the site of the base was not disclosed but the statement 
claimed libyan agents operating in the western sudanese province of 
darfour have been directing aggression against chad 
chad has long accused the sudanese government of allowing libya 
and the rebel movements it supports to launch attacks from darfour 
into eastern chad 
the few rebels who survived the 12hour battle fled to 
support camps in libya the statement said 
chadian troops captured 17 artillery pieces machine guns 11 
trucks 60 grenade launchers radio transmitters and medical 
supplies the statement said 
the foreign ministry said the libyan islamic legion is comprised 
mostly of thousands of chadian and sudanese workers in libya 
forced to take up arms against chad after a short period of 
military training 
the incursions by the rebels violate an agreement reached 
between the two countries aug 31 in algeria to end 16 years of 
hostilities the ministry said

us attorney general dick thornburgh said 
thursday he was determined to open the united states to any jew 
wanting to leave the soviet union 
thornburgh speaking to the national civil rights committee of 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith said immigration quotas 
limit the number of soviets to 50000 annually but the bush 
administration has proposed an increase of 30000 
we must see that the window of emigration that is now open is 
left open he said the united states has been a beacon for 
those who aspire to breath the fresh air of freedom and we dont 
want to slam a door in the face of anyone who seeks to come here 
thornurgh spoke about his recent trip to the soviet union where 
he met with activists and said everyone agreed the new openness 
instigated by soviet president mikhail gorbachev had truly brought 
change 
in 1976 when i was last in the soviet union only 787 jews 
were allowed to emigrate to the united states the attorney 
general said in 1990 there will be more than 100000 
applications 
soviet jewish emigration has increased dramatically under 
gorbachev from 8000 in 1987 to 19000 last year and a projected 
35000 in 1989 nonjewish emigration this year is expected to 
reach 15000 
but new us immigration rules have aroused some fears that 
soviet jews could forced to go elsewhere under rules effective 
oct 1 soviet jews no longer can leave that country with visas for 
israel then apply in vienna or rome for refugee status in the 
united states instead the refugees paperwork is being processed 
at the us embassy in moscow the same as any other wouldbe 
immigrants

a measles epidemic has killed 17 people and 
hospitalized hundreds in southern california this year racing 
through vulnerable ethnic communities and college campuses public 
health officials said 
while outbreaks of measles have been reported this year in 
chicago and houston the epidemic in five southern california 
counties is the nations biggest and has sputtered and flared for 
more than two years 
its very hard to keep control in a large urban area where you 
have a large influx of people from other countries dr gary 
euler of the san bernardino county public health department said 
thursday 
state health officials also have been forced to contend with a 
shortage of vaccine said dr loring dales chief of immunization 
for the california department of health services and vaccine 
prices jumped sharply in 1988 as the demand for inoculations soared 
30 percent dales said 
dales blames the epidemic on the lack of immunization among 
children 
in recent weeks at least eight university of california at los 
angeles students have contracted measles threatening another 
flareup 
at least 1629 cases have been reported in los angeles county 
alone since the stubborn outbreak began in august 1987 said chuck 
alexander director of immunization for the los angeles county 
health department that includes 12 deaths so far this year and two 
reported in 1988 
another 1259 cases have been counted in 1989 in san bernardino 
riverside orange and san diego counties including five deaths in 
san bernardino 
typical measles symptoms include fever headache sore eyes 
heavy coughing and a rash blossoming in the fourth or fifth day 
dales said

a nun who received threatening letters 
while working as a religious educator in guatemala disappeared 
thursday from a retreat house there members of her order said 
sister diana ortiz 31 had been praying alone in a courtyard at 
the belene sisters retreat house in antigua between 8 and 9 am 
when she disappeared said sister mary elizabeth dallard of the 
mount st joseph ursuline sisters of maple mount ky 
members of the roman catholic order fear ortiz has been 
kidnapped but no group has claimed responsibility for the 
disappearance the courierjournal of louisville reported in 
fridays editions 
ortiz a native of grants had received at least seven 
threatening letters since january all warning her to leave the 
country dallard said 
dallard said ortiz would not have wandered off when others at 
the retreat center finished breakfast dallard said ortiz was gone 
and her shawl was found on the ground 
ortiz and two other ursuline sisters were in the central 
american country to work as religious educators in the village of 
san miguel acatan 
some of the letters said the military know youre here 
dont ever go around alone and theres people here that want 
to hurt you dallard said adding that ortiz had asked her to 
keep the letters for evidence in case something happened 
theres no logical reason why anybody would have anything 
against her dallard said she did a lot of work with little 
kids theres no way anybody could find anything subversive in what 
she was doing 
in washington state department spokesman dave denny said the 
us embassy in guatemala city has a report on ortiz and the 
guatemalan police also have been given a missing person report 
the police wait 24 hours before doing anything to see if a 
missing person turns up he said

us and soviet officials are jockeying over 
expectations for next months summit between president bush and 
mikhail s gorbachev debating whether it will be merely a lowkey 
meeting or a milestone in superpower relations 
planning for the dec 23 summit took a leap forward wednesday 
with the announcement that the talks will be held in the 
mediterranean on ships off the coast of malta 
i think that this meeting can just be the end of the cold 
war said soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov the cold war will 
be dumped down to the bottom of the mediterranean sea 
gerasimovs dramatic prediction stood in stark contrast to 
bushs portrayal of the talks as a relaxed opportunity for a 
getacquainted session with no expectation of any agreements

the recent string of accidents aboard navy 
vessels may just be due to bad luck rather than a lack of training 
or poor equipment congressional military experts say 
but one civilian specialist whos studied hazards aboard 
aircraft carriers warns that budget cuts in navy training could 
lead to more accidents 
congress is always trying to cut training budgets but if a 
pilot cant practice flying those on the deck dont get trained 
either its a prescription for an accident said karlene 
roberts an industrial psychologist participating in a fiveyear 
study of nimitzclass aircraft carriers and hazardous industrial 
systems 
overall ms roberts said the navys safety record is 
excellent 
from sundays jet crash aboard the aircraft carrier uss

the controversy over computerprogrammed trading 
of stocks is compelling investors to review basic assumptions about 
the very definition of a marketplace 
in some ways the search for that definition is clouded by 
details and the fury of the fighting by vested interests defending 
their views and attacking their opponents and by the enormous sums 
of money involved 
away from the immediate fray however random discussions with 
investors and others suggest there still is some agreement on what 
services should be provided by a functional market 
among them it must bring buyer and seller together for the 
transaction of business it must handle trades quickly fairly and 
efficiently and it must establish a reasonable sense of values 
in specific regard to a stock market there seems to be 
agreement that it must raise capital for industry allow investors 
equal access to buying and selling and facilitate their 
participation in corporate ownership while establishing relative 
values providing liquidity and avoiding volatility 
how well americas financial markets are handling such 
obligations is therefore at the heart of the argument over program 
trading which has been accused of causing or exacerbating 
explosive price movements on heavy volume 
in essence the most common form of such trading is socalled 
index arbitrage or shortterm computertriggered buying or 
selling to exploit brief pricing inconsistencies between spot and 
futures markets 
individuals arent likely to be involved because it takes 
millions of dollars to even qualify but for certain brokers and 
pension fund managers millions of dollars are no obstacle to 
playing this game 
among the arguments against it are these it tends to cause or 
exacerbate big price swings it undermines valuations it serves 
little economic purpose it threatens price collapses and it 
drives individuals from the market 
at the extreme some investors view todays marketplace as a 
gathering ground for reckless gameplaying by privileged traders 
and program trading as a device letting large investors skim 
profits without risk or responsibility 
in short they view recent events as a numbers game played by 
intelligent computers rather than individuals investing in values 
something of a chess game in which computers instantly process 
myriad possibilities 
but shouldnt a free market be able to accommodate anything 
tossed at it it might be true in concept but rarely in practice 
markets of all sorts even those in relatively simple bartering 
have rules regulations and limitations 
random informal samplings of opinion suggest that individual 
investors arent totally against program trading most likely 
ordinary people do not automatically fear big dollars or great 
speed as in computer trading 
they recognize that computers are changing life and that to 
resist change might also be to resist opportunity they know life 
evolves in unanticipated ways and ways not easily understood and 
that they must remain current 
among questions now puzzling people however is instability 
for years the nations stock exchanges boasted of their ability to 
maintain generally smooth trading patterns with relatively minor 
price changes between transactions 
now investors are told to expect greater volatility in the 
future than they were accustomed to in the past and they wonder if 
this isnt an admission of market failure or at least of an 
unhealthy situation 
what has happened they ask to the ability to quickly match 
buyer and seller 
why cant the damage be contained without requiring the 
reassurance of government 
why cant the same technology that made program trading possible 
be employed to accommodate or at least reduce the negative impact 
of program trading 
everyone is asking questions and very few people are providing 
answers 
just as an imbalance of buyers and sellers creates marketplace 
volatility it seems that an imbalance of information creates 
questions to be answered

after years of tight budgets american

the manned station freedom an 
orbiting outpost of america in the icy silence of space will take 
center stage in the us space effort in the 1990s and be a 
springboard for human journeys to the moon and mars 
american scientists also expect to reap a rich harvest during 
the decade with an armada of sophisticated unmanned spacecraft that 
will explore the planets and peer back into the beginning of time 
at the same time the soviets will continue development of a 
space shuttle and exploit their own space station mir as they 
pursue their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to mars early in 
the 21st century 
and the growing space programs of the european space agency 
japan and china will expand as they embark on their own manned 
space efforts 
as the new decade begins americas future course is uncertain 
its space program is at a crossroads and it will be up to the bush 
administration the congress and the people to decide which 
direction it should take 
in july on the 20th anniversary of mans first landing on the 
moon president bush stood on the steps of the national air and 
space museum and declared we must commit ourselves anew to a 
sustained program of manned exploration of the solar system and 
yes the permanent settlement of space 
he proposed a longterm continuing commitment to completion 
of space station freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base on 
the moon and a manned mission to mars early in the next century 
but the president provided no firm timetable or budgets for such 
grand schemes instead directing vice president dan quayle as head 
of the national space council to work out the details 
bush is expected to offer a more detailed plan in his state of 
the union address early next year 
freedom is the key element in the entire exploration plan since 
it would serve as a training base and launchpad for the more 
ambitious flights to the moon and mars 
but the space station has had a troubled history the original 
plan called for astronauts aboard space shuttles to begin 
assembling it in orbit in 1992 with a total of 20 shuttle flights 
needed to have it fully operational by 1995 
cost overruns budget cuts and nasas poor job of selling the 
station to a skeptical congress have delayed the project and 
initial assembly is now scheduled to start in 1995 or 1996 
the us cost will be about 25 billion with european japanese 
and canadian partners contributing modules and other station 
facilities worth an additional 8 billion this will give 
astronautresearchers of these nations access to the station and 
provide them with valuable experience for developing independent 
manned space programs 
orbiting 250 miles up the station would provide living and 
working quarters for as many as eight people with astronauts 
rotating back to earth after four to six months some would stay 
longer to gain longterm exposure to weightless living in 
preparation for a mars flight that might take as long as 18 months 
as a scientific base the station will allow humans to study the 
stars and planets from the pollutionfree environment of space the 
weightless world will permit the processing of new pure medicines 
metals and other products that cannot be made in earths gravity 
and astronauts aboard freedom would assemble service and repair 
satellites and send them out to explore space 
space science is experiencing a resurgence after years of 
neglect because of tight nasa budgets 
we are embarking on a golden age of space science said 
lennard fisk the agencys associate administrator for space 
science and applications whats coming up is an era of 
unprecedented excitement and activity 
among the events scheduled in the 1990s 
magellan launched from a space shuttle last may is to orbit 
venus next august and will study that planet for several years 
galileo launched from a shuttle in october is to orbit 
jupiter in 1995 and fire a probe into its atmosphere en route 
galileo will probe venus and take the first closeup look at an 
asteroid 
cobe cosmic background explorer set for launch nov 19 will 
spend years studying how stars and galaxies were formed by 
analyzing cosmic background radiation consisting of particles of 
light or photons permeating the universe 
rosat a cooperative mission with west germany will be 
launched next year to send back a detailed survey of xrays emitted 
into the universe by violent explosions such as those occurring at 
the end of a stars life 
hubble space telescope to be launched from a shuttle next 
march will enable astronomers to observe stars and galaxies so far 
away that they will be viewing these remote bodies as they existed 
14 billion years ago near the time scientists believe the universe 
was formed 
mars observer will be launched in 1992 to orbit the red planet 
for a multiyear examination 
other payloads scheduled for deployment from the shuttle in the 
next few years include a series of astro spacecraft carrying 
ultraviolet and xray telescopes to study quasars pulsars and 
other celestial objects the gamma ray observatory to explore gamma 
ray sources throughout the universe and ulysses to probe the sun 
during the 1990s nasa will also continue research together 
with the defense department on developing the national aerospace 
plane which would take off from a runway like a jet plane and 
accelerate into orbit if congress provides adequate funding for 
this nextgeneration manned space vehicle a prototype could begin 
test flights late in the decade and it could become operational 
sometime after 2000

astronomers soon will be able to 
look out almost to the beginning of time to study how the universe 
began and how it has evolved 
their window will be the hubble space telescope the most 
expensive most finely crafted unmanned space vehicle ever built 
scheduled for release into earth orbit next march by a space 
shuttle crew the 17 billion telescope will become astronomys 
most significant tool in expanding our knowledge of the universe 
during the 1990s and into the 21st century 
it will be one of the premier science missions of this 
century said lennard fisk director of space sciences for the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
orbiting 370 miles high this 25500pound 435footlong 
package of precision instruments will look seven times more deeply 
into space detect objects 50 times fainter and view them with 10 
times greater clarity than the best groundbased observatory thus 
expanding the universe visible to humans by 350 times 
at the heart of the telescope named for edwin p hubble a 
trailblazing american astronomer of the 1920s is a 945inch 
primary optical mirror the most precise ever made there is no 
bump or ripple on its highly polished surface that deviates more 
than onemillionth of an inch from an ideally perfect curve 
from its vantage point outside earths murky atmosphere the 
telescope will be able to probe a distance of 14 billion light 
years offering views of galaxies so distant they will appear as 
they were when the universe was formed the best ground telescopes 
look back only 8 billion years 
astronomers enhancing the telescopes images with computers will 
gain new knowledge about black holes pulsars cosmic dust clouds 
gaseous nebulae supernovae neutron stars quasars and other 
celestial mysteries 
said james westphal a california institute of technology 
planetary scientist i suspect that we will find some amazing 
things that will thrill the public not once a year but maybe once 
a month

jennifer raineys assessment of summer 
vacation used to be three long months of boring 
that was before she transferred to fairmount elementary school 
where students attend class yearround and summer break is replaced 
by four minivacations that fall just when a sixthgrader needs them 
it gives you something to look forward to said jennifer 
11 you think hey a couple more weeks of this and then i get 
three off i like it this way because it seems like you get more 
time off 
jennifers is the nations longestrunning yearround school 
francis howell school district just west of st louis pioneered 
the concept in 1969 in an effort to solve overcrowding but today 
education reformers think the idea may be just what the country 
needs to improve its educational system 
were asking schools to do more and more but were keeping 
the clock and the calendar the same you cant fit 10 gallons into 
a fivegallon can said ernie boyer former us commissioner of 
education and now the head of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching in princeton nj 
students spend the same number of days in class but instead of 
a summer vacation they get shorter breaks throughout the year more 
and more schools are scrapping traditional schedules in favor of 
the more efficient yearround ones and no one seems to be 
complaining 
im convinced that a longer school year is inevitable because 
of the need to meet the changing work and family patterns of 
the nation boyer said 
this year an estimated 475000 students in 19 states less 
than 1 percent of the nations students attend yearround 
schools said charles ballinger executive director of the national 
association for yearround schooling 
but thats twice as many as five years ago he said 
ohio has the longest school year with 182 days and minnesota 
has the shortest with 170 according to the education commission of 
the states the missouri board of education plans to ask the 
legislature to increase its 174day year the nations 
secondshortest to 200 by the year 2000 thirtyfour states use 
180day school years 
even if the school year isnt lengthened many educators say a 
yearround schedule makes sense some say it improves learning 
others say it helps ease overcrowding and puts school buildings to 
work full time 
the traditional agricultural calendar has no value to us any 
longer said norman brekke superintendent of the k8 oxnard 
school district in ventura county calif as a matter of fact 
the ninemonth calendar and the fact that schools are out for three 
months of the year is a costly extravagance which i dont believe 
our society should accept 
brekke said his district saved 16 million the cost of two new 
schools by converting to yearround classes in 1976 and test 
scores have improved 
supporters of yearround schooling include the missouri national 
education association which recently issued a task force report 
recommending that all of the states schools consider yearround 
programs 
in california state law requires districts to file a 
feasibility study on yearround schools or have a program to be 
eligible for some building funds 
utah also has provided incentives for consideration of 
yearround plans and some innercity districts must have yearround 
schooling by the 199091 year 
however some educators say that while they like the idea its 
not always workable 
in st louis for example superintendent jerome jones said the 
buildings arent equipped for yearround instruction most arent 
airconditioned and the district already is strapped for money to 
pay for paint and plaster 
personally i think its desireable jones said if it 
were possible i would explore it 
even the francis howell district has found its not workable at 
the secondary level an experiment with a junior high school failed 
because of the problems presented by extracurricular activities 
like sports 
another group thats not exactly thrilled is the summer camp 
industry 
people are very concerned about what could happen but at the 
moment the impact hasnt been significant said shirley walch 
who heads the american camping associations southern california 
section some of our camps can accommodate and adapt and then 
there are some that could be devastated by it 
administrators at fairmount say their system is supported by 
students teachers and parents 
its a system thats worked very effectively said principal 
larry smith the burdensome part is developing the schedule 
staffing the building and the movement of students and teachers in 
school 
fairmount students are split into four cycles and attend class 
for nine weeks followed by three weeks off the start of each 
cycle is staggered so that at any given time three cycles are in 
session and one is off classrooms are always filled 
the system is not without some drawbacks though teachers say 
the biggest headache is moving 
a classroom teacher rotates with her students so when you go 
off cycle on your threeweek break you move out of your classroom 
so another teacher and class can move in said teacher chris 
guinther so you end up having to pack up your teaching materials 
and supplies logistically its a problem 
ideally when overcrowding is not a factor a yearround school 
has only one cycle and teachers dont have to move 
for working parents the biggest concern is arranging for child 
care when their vacations dont coincide with their kids some 
children use the time to visit grandparents or enroll in ymca or 
other activities 
when the schedules do coincide said fairmount assistant 
principal pat mccoy then its an advantage because you can take 
your kids to disneyland in september or october and you dont have 
to take them out of school and you miss all the crowds

johannes makoti started out as a 
12aweek mechanic in this sunbaked village today he is a 
millionaire the owner of 13 businesses and one of a handful of 
south african blacks who have surmounted countless legal and 
financial obstacles to make fortunes 
hes often on the job at one or more of his businesses which 
include a taxi fleet 
one recent day he was found repairing the brakes on one of his 
five taxivans hes also worked as the attendant at his gas 
station the waiter at his restaurant and the checkout clerk at his 
supermarket 
hes carried bread across rainswollen rivers to his bakery 
because delivery trucks couldnt travel the washedout dirt road 
that links bolobedu to the outside world 
makoti is at work by 6 am to make sure his makoti cafe opens 
on time and hes usually there at 9 pm when it closes 
in between he and his two wives supervise 87 workers at the 
makoti garage the makoti general shopping center the makoti 
supermarket the makoti bar lounge the makoti motel and restaurant 
i had a dream in 1962 that one day i would become a successful 
businessman said the burly softspoken makoti now 49 
i told my friend about it and he didnt believe me then now 
he does 
he estimates his businesses are worth more than 7 million rand 
about 25 million 
others among south africas 28 million blacks long denied 
opportunities in the africas most prosperous economy now run 
businesses ranging from oneperson street stalls to construction 
companies 
an estimated 100000 blackowned taxivans are carrying more 
black commuters than whiteowned buses and stateowned trains 
about 40000 blacks operate spaza shops small groceries run 
from their homes 
a recent survey of 100 leading black entrepreneurs by tribute 
magazine found more than 40 own businesses worth at least 370000 
many of the legal obstacles confronting black businessmen have 
fallen away in recent years but a lack of experience and 
difficulties in raising capital can stifle even ambitious 
entrepreneurs 
in addition black business progress has been limited almost 
exclusively to major cities in rural areas such as bolobedu part 
of the tribal homeland of lebowa jobs are scarce and wages low 
bolobedu consists of several hundred mud and thatch huts on a 
patch of barren red earth 30 miles from the nearest tarred road 
villagers who get jobs on nearby whiteowned farms make about 25 a 
month 
makoti the son of a laborer quit high school and left bolobedu 
to work as a mechanic first in johannesburg and later in 
phalaborwa about 55 miles outside his hometown in south africas 
northeast corner 
in 1971 he bought a used de soto and began a taxi service 
transporting his work colleagues between phalaborwa and bolobedu on 
weekends 
a year later he had saved enough to buy two used taxivans and 
hire a driver he then quit his job and became bolobedus first 
tycoon 
he started with a cafe then added a gas station supermarket 
liquor store barber shop driving school and hes still building 
makoti said he repeatedly has been turned down for bank loans 
so he started his own construction company and built his own 
businesses brick by brick 
when i started there were no businesses here at all said 
makoti i have tried to improve the situation to create jobs 
he has built a health clinic now run by the homeland 
government and sponsors a soccer club and a troupe of traditional 
dancers 
makoti and his wives elizabeth and melita live simply and 
seldom leave bolobedu he says hes never taken a vacation unless 
one counts a business trip in 1983 to visit factories in japan 
hong kong and taiwan 
his only luxury is a 22room ranchstyle house which was 
heavily damaged by a fire in 1988 a year after it was built 
makoti and his wives now live in two small circular huts while 
the house is being restored most of their seven daughters and six 
sons ages 5 to 27 are away at schools 
even in an area as impoverished as bolobedu makotis wealth 
earns him more respect than resentment according to several local 
residents one group of young men said they admired makoti for 
helping develop a village that has long been ignored by the 
government 
the vital concerns in such rural areas are jobs and food rather 
than antiapartheid political activity 
in the cities some black activists are hostile toward wealthy 
blacks believing the capitalist economy is as much a part of white 
domination as racial segregation laws 
to be a black achiever today is nothing less than choosing a 
cozy seat in the ranks of those who keep our people down sandile 
memela a black writer said in frontline magazine 
but in a companion article journalist kaizer nyatsumba assailed 
the odd logic that blacks must live in abject poverty if 
they are to be truly relevant in the fight against apartheid

the best way to avoid traffic jams is to keep 
out of automobiles a luxury more employees will enjoy in the 
1990s as they use computers and phones to telecommute while 
working at home 
the communications revolution is going to have a profound 
effect on transportation said montreal futurist louis damore 
were going to be seeing all sorts of people gainfully employed 
through telecommuting 
telecommuting is one of the few developments that might have 
significant impact in reducing traffic congestion in the 1990s 
and also can stem air pollution said john seymour vice president 
of southern california business sales for pacific bell 
less than 1000 of pacific bells 65000 employees now work on 
computers at home but the number will rise to about 5000 
telecommuters by the mid to late 1990s seymour said 
los angeles county plans to make 2000 of its employees 
telecommuters within two years and other large employers are 
considering the possibility he added 
seymour said telecommuting is just plain good business 
when you get the employee off the freeway they tend to have 
much higher morale are happier and frankly are much more 
oriented toward doing their work in a productive way he said 
if you have a new mother she is able to do the job and meet the 
demands of being a mother 
telecommuting means less office space is needed for employees 
seymour also said a single manager can supervise more telecommuters 
because employees see working at home as a real advantage to 
themselves and generally do higher quality work and more work 
seymour said telecommuting that allows people to shop bank and 
trade stock from home is just getting started 
lockheed boeing and general dynamics said recently they are 
saving 5 million annually on a joint project by having employees 
meet via a crosscountry computer network 
seymour recently used video teleconferencing to meet with 
colleagues in san francisco allowing him to avoid flying back and 
forth from los angeles 
i spent two hours for a twohour meeting instead of seven 
hours he said

although high in the andes and far from 
anything else this village of communal farmers has not escaped a 
maoist guerrillas terror campaign to disupt nationwide municipal 
elections sunday and in the long run the presidential election 
next year 
a column of 30 guerrillas of the sendero luminoso shining path 
movement entered andajes one stormy night and seized mayor heraclio 
segundo four other local officials and a sixth man they accused of 
cattle rustling they then dragged them into the village plaza 
where they killed them with single gunshots to the back of the neck 
as a result no candidates are running for office sunday in 
andajes 
all that people think about is that they will come back that 
there will be more killings said andres zuniga bernabe a young 
farmer 
the wave of assassinations of mayors and other local officials 
in peru has reached levels unprecedented in the shining paths 
9yearold insurgency 
latest available figures show that 263 mayors posts around peru 
are unfilled nearly all of them in small towns and villages with 
little or no police protection 
in junin department in the countrys mining and farming 
heartland 150 miles east of lima only 61 of 122 municipalities 
have mayors 
some 4500 candidates registered to run in the nations nearly 
2000 mayoralty races but an estimated 400 have resigned in fear 
and government officials expect many more to withdraw before 
election day 
so far this year the rebels have slain 45 mayors they also have 
killed 73 local judges clerks councilmen and municipal candidates 
in october 22 local authorities were slain a total of 330 
people died in armed clashes and political violence one of the 
highest monthly tolls since the shining path launched its 
insurgency to topple perus elected government 
shining path seeks to install a workers and peasants state 
patterned on the ideas of the late chairman mao tsetung of china 
political analysts and counterinsurgency experts agree that the 
rebels campaign to disrupt the municipal elections is only the 
first stage of their strategy to block the presidential election in 
april and provoke a military coup 
shining paths strategy then most likely would be to place 
itself in the vanguard of a popular front against a military 
dictatorship 
publicly the populist government of president alan garcia has 
guaranteed that municipal elections will take place throughout peru 
but privately a close garcia aide speaking in lima on condition 
he not be identified said the truth is we are not in a position 
to guarantee the normal course of elections i wonder how many 
people are going to be able to vote 
he said peru would need 300000 policemen not the 75000 it 
has to provide aroundtheclock protection to current authorities 
and all municipal candidates 
national election board officials are focusing their efforts on 
guaranteeing that voting takes place in a normal fashion in lima 
and other major cities where most of perus population of 21 
million is concentrated 
a third of the national territory is under states of emergency 
that suspend constitutional guarantees and give the military broad 
powers to fight guerrillas 
it is in those areas that the elections are most in doubt but 
many critics of government policy say the contested regions cannot 
be written off if peru is going to defend its democratic system 
here in andajes situated on the dome of an 11000foot 
mountain people feel the government has knowingly let them pass 
into the shining paths domain 
andajes is only 90 miles north of lima in a straight line but a 
sixhour ride over bumpy roads that rise from the mistshrouded 
desert coast and climb the empty western slopes of the andes 
with its 2000 inhabitants its narrow cobblestone lanes and its 
mudbrick houses andajes never received much attention in lima 
but now the villagers feel totally abandoned 
the people live with the fear that sendero will return said 
village elder ruben torres 
the 16man police detachment sent to andajes after its officials 
were killed withdrew in june to the town of churin an hours drive 
away at the foot of the mountain 
most people did not sleep that firs night said nancy jiron 
a government health worker assigned to andajes they gathered in 
small groups and waited for daybreak they began to realize they 
would have to accept being alone again

while other countries are restricting the use of 
asbestos in buildings in some cases getting rid of it japan 
goes on using it and remains the worlds largest asbestos consumer 
it would be a catastrophe if a severe earthquake like the one 
in san francisco hit tokyo and destroyed buildings like ours 
said hikosaburo yoda a mechanical engineering instructor at tokyo 
university 
and think about how many buildings containing asbestos are 
demolished for reconstruction every day its even more scary 
about 120 buildings are destroyed every day in tokyo alone the 
local government says 
scientists say that inhaling asbestos can cause fatal lung 
damage including asbestosis and cancer 
at a recent seminar in tokyo dr irving selikoff a professor 
of medicine at mount sinai hospital in new york city urged the 
japanese to cut asbestos consumption and promptly tighten safety 
measures 
the mineral fiber is used in some 3000 common items including 
walls roof tiles and automobile brakes 
japan considers asbestos contamination an occupational problem 
and has compensated 65 victims including 43 lung cancer patients 
said teruo arakawa a labor ministry spokesman he said he had no 
figures on how many had died 
in work places handling the material japan allows 10 times as 
much asbestos fiber in the air as the us environmental protection 
agency 2 fibers per cubic centimeter for most kinds of asbestos 
japan has decided however to set a general limit for asbestos 
in the air effective at the end of this year but the figure has 
yet to be announced 
it banned the spraying of asbestos insulation in 1975 but 
government officials say materials containing asbestos are 
indispensable for fireproofing 
gov shunichi suzuki of tokyo who once promised to make tokyo 
asbestosfree now says the material is safe as long as its not 
sprayed asbestos is being used in a new city hall building 
japan has no plan to follow the us move to ban all 
asbestoscontaining material from public schools by 1996 
in 1987 however the education ministry ordered 47000 public 
schools throughout japan to inspect sprayed asbestos in classrooms 
and gymnasiums said kiyoshi sawamoto an education ministry 
spokesman 
only 1366 or 3 percent of the inspected schools reported they 
had sprayed asbestos and some 1000 have removed it sawamoto said 
more than 50 percent of japans classrooms and gymnasiums were 
built before 1975 when asbestos was widely sprayed he added 
because it is difficult to learn the locations and condition of 
asbestos in buildings even wellplanned demolition is never safe 
enough said sentaro yamazaki a representative of nippon asbestos 
abatement industries association 
once fibers are released in the environment they cannot be 
retracted he said 
no law requires contractors to warn neighbors of building 
demolition projects yamazaki added 
the government says japan used 320000 tons of asbestos 80 
percent for construction in 1988 the amount will surpass 350000 
tons in 1989 said akinobu ito of the all japan dockworkers union 
asbestos factories are required to conduct air samplings twice a 
year and report the results but regardless of the outcome there 
are no provisions for penalties or mandatory health checks said 
jun sakamoto spokesman for the environmental agency

his name was gary cooper in a time now fast 
receding he was the greatest of all movie stars 
thats how gary cooper american life american legend 
begins as written by richard schickel and narrated by clint 
eastwood the onehour tnt specials first showing is sunday at 8 
pm est 
maria cooper janis painter and only child of gary cooper 
agrees with the statement 
the idea for the special was hers she wanted through film 
clips and home movies to show her late father as a man and an 
actor to viewers born since his death at 60 in 1961 there was 
diversity in roles he was able to portray it wasnt just the 
stereotyped westerner 
and she wanted to show his values he liked to play roles that 
pointed up a sense of valor and quality in human behavior playing 
sergeant york and lou gehrig gave him his pleasure in life he 
liked the ones that pointed up the best that we can be rather than 
the lowest that we can fall to 
mrs janis adds heroes are not uncomplicated theyre not 
goody goody human conflict and struggle goes on 
her father she said hated stupid dialogue and unreal 
situations 
cooper was famous in movies for brevity of speech comics used 
to get laughs indicating that all he said was yup 
in his private life his daughter says he wasnt a lecturer 
or a pontificator but he chatted about ordinary things he had a 
wry sense of humor 
her fathers fame she says did not cause her to have a 
troubled childhood mrs janis says all the trappings the phony 
part that can come into that hollywood way of life didnt for them 
her parents and therefore i had a very solid kind of base 
cooper left his family for five or six years after he met 
actress patricia neal which is mentioned in the special facts 
are the facts mrs janis says people live their lives and 
things happen and they go through difficult periods 
when doctors found that cooper had lung colon and bone cancer 
his daughter who had never wanted to act recalls i thought 
maybe i should try carry on the family name she took three 
lessons it helped her master a stutter but she realized acting 
wasnt for her and returned to painting 
she chose schickel film critic for time to write the tv 
special because of the foreword he wrote for the book legends 
i thought it was the only thing ive ever read about my father 
that captured him 
her pianist husband byron janis is battling arthritis in his 
hands and increasingly is turning from performing to lecturing 
about chopin working for the global forum on human survival and 
composing 
she asked him to write music for the special one day he played 
two themes for her she says i cried at both of them it was 
really like my father had walked into the room he wove them into 
song for a hero which is part of the soundtrack 
sometimes mrs janis gives lectures about growing up in 
hollywood i was in cincinnati and i said that something which 
moved papa tremendously during the war was going to the south 
pacific to visit the troops he was nervous and said i dont sing 
or tell jokes what can i give the guys the captain said coop 
all they want you to do is say the lou gehrig speech he didnt 
know if he remembered it he said it everybody was in silence and 
tears 
after my talk a woman came up to me she said i was a nurse 
and heard your father do it you cannot imagine what that meant to 
those boys

on sunday night and again on monday nbc will 
air cross of fire a twopart tale of a particularly evil ku 
klux klan leader in indiana its earnest badly written too 
let us put it another way if you heard a character in a work of 
serious tv drama say theres lawlessness and loose morals right 
here in indiana would you stay tuned 
nbcs work of serious tv drama tells of the rise in the 1920s of 
a young handsome rich indianapolis klansman who denies he is 
bigoted likewise the klan he insists that each only wants 
morality prohibition and patrotism 
a gifted recruiter he swells klan membership rolls with such 
talk he also is in his stiff way crazed with love for a 
beautiful state education worker who only wants to help the 
children of black migrant workers learn to read 
with john heard as the klansman and mel harris as the educator 
the film also is in theory a drama about how the klan masking 
hatred of blacks jews and catholics once became a strong 
political force in america 
based on what nbc calls the true story of klan leader and 
political boss dc stephenson and occasionally using old newsreel 
clips of klan parades and seemingly benign deeds this could have 
been a good twohour movie 
but that would have required a decision to either concentrate on 
the klans rise or on stephenson whom this film eventually shows 
as a sham a drunk and a sadist one who kidnaps the woman he 
professes to love and so viciously abuses her after the kidnapping 
that she takes poison 
instead nbcs epic written by robert crais tries on both 
fronts the result is four long hours of cliches with a plodding 
first part that turns vicious near its end and a concluding 
chapter of courtroom melodrama that features lloyd bridges as the 
crafty old defense lawyer 
complete with a crusading indianapolis newspaper editor george 
dzundza who helps an inexperienced young prosecutor david morse 
bring stephenson heard to justice this cross is almost too 
much to bear 
heard and harris each are fine actors but save for moments when 
heard gets to erupt in drunken rages their characters are so 
wooden they could be a termite paradise one keeps wondering why 
theyre so attracted to each other 
harris madge oberholtzer also seems naive beyond repair true 
when he tells her the klan is going to crown him grand dragon and 
asks if she knows what that means she playfully inquires you 
turn green and grow scales 
but when he blabbers his love for her all she can say is 
its all so confusing steve 
well any woman would be confused by a swain who likes to wear a 
purple hood and robe and start a klan rally by welcoming the 
imperial wizard grand goblins exalted cyclops and all 
citizens of the invisible empire 
this would be fine comedy were it not for the brutality he 
wreaks on her later on but even those shocking moments are 
followed by passages that continue to exhibit author crais ear for 
memorable dialogue 
a good example uttered in mondays chapter by a young reporter 
after reports of violence against the klan is this sounds to me 
like the seeds of a fullblown rebellion against the klan 
sounds to me like you can miss all this

on the road on rails in the air 
transportation systems may take on a new look in the 1990s but 
some things may never change this is one of a periodic series of 
articles the 90s looking ahead to the promise and peril of 
the upcoming decade in the environment medicine technology and 
society 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the 1990s will bring new trolleys and 
highspeed trains and efforts to develop hypersonic planes but 
the decade will resemble the 80s for people stuck in clogged 
airports and bumperobumper traffic 
if youre looking at the 90s the automobile will remain the 
dominant mode of travel said researcher lyn long of the 
institute of transportation studies at the university of 
california irvine 
because of increasing auto ownership and twoworker 
households there will be more cars on the road and the system will 
never keep pace she said urban traffic congestion will be 
status quo or worse 
the federal highway administration says 110 million us 
commuters now spend 2 billion hours a year in traffic jams that 
will increase to 10 billion hours by 2005 
as usual southern california will be in the forefront of the 
traffic troubles one study predicts average speed on freeways and 
highways in this region will drop from 35 mph to 19 mph by 2010 
experts say air pollution and possible oil shortages in the 
1990s will spur production of cleaner highermileage cars 
increased use of vehicles that run on methanol natural gas 
electricity or solar power construction of more trolleys and other 
light rail systems and more vacation travel by trains planes 
and cruise ships 
with the nations expressway system almost complete increased 
attention will be paid to traffic management measures like 
those credited with keeping los angeles freeways freeflowing 
during the 1984 olympics said peter gordon director of the 
university of southern californias planning institute 
traffic management includes synchronized traffic lights metered 
onramps carpool and bus lanes quicker towing at accident sites 
adding narrower lanes without widening freeways more oneway 
streets reversible traffic lanes staggered work hours and limits 
on times trucks can move goods 
but these strategies havent helped much in the past and seemed 
to work during the olympics because many people were so scared 
by gridlock predictions that they stopped driving said 
langhorne bond expresident of the american association of state 
highway and transportation officials 
dashboard navigation systems that give drivers traffic 
information to avoid congestion will gradually come into 
widespread use between now and the year 2000 consultant robert 
l french wrote recently in the futurist magazine 
twentyfive cars are involved in testing such a system on los 
angeles santa monica freeway 
beyond 2000 radar cruise controls might allow auto convoys to 
speed down freeways at 70 mph spaced only feet apart a prototype 
will be tested soon near san diego 
toll roads will be increasingly common in the 1990s long said 
traffic jams also may spur road pricing in which road 
sensors trigger incar meters so motorists get billed for using 
busy routes during rush hours she said 
gordon said city dwellers fleeing to suburbia will confound 
doomsday forecasts of urban gridlock 
suburbanization is the great decongestant because it spreads 
things out and takes pressure off downtown gordon said 
industry follows the labor force into the suburbs so most 
commuting is suburbtosuburb on less congested routes thats why 
the system hasnt gone to hell already 
the institute of transportation engineers however said more 
than 86 percent of us population growth since 1950 has been in 
suburbs causing an explosion in the number of suburbtosuburb 
trips and significant increases in suburban road congestion 
long said many cities already are adopting lowtech light 
rail 
such systems exist or are under construction in san jose san 
diego long beach and sacramento in california in portland ore 
and buffalo ny 
gordon however insisted rail has been a flop in cities that 
have tried it in the last 20 years its been hugely expensive 
its been a disappointment in terms of ridership and its had 
almost no impact on traffic 
montreal futurist louis j damore countered that oil shortages 
air pollution and traffic congestion mean a continuing trend 
toward mass transit 
trains with speeds up to 150 mph such as japans bullet 
trains are under consideration for los angeleslas vegas los 
angelessan diego and houstondallasfort worth undersea 
eurotunnel rail linking britain and france is due for completion in 
1993 
by 2000 highspeed trains also may run in the 
vancouverseattle bostonnew yorkwashington and miamiorlando 
corridors and every major city in europe will be linked by 
highspeed rail damore predicted 
airports are becoming so congested it will make more sense on 
trips of 200 to 300 miles to go by train rather than plane he 
added 
air travelers face higher fares and worse congestion in getting 
to and through major airports and airlines can grow only by making 
medium and smallersized airports into hubs said bond who 
headed the federal aviation administration during jimmy carters 
presidency 
bond said increasing air traffic will prod the faa to limit 
arrivals and departures at more airports 
air travelers dreaming of fast trips aboard hypersonic jets will 
have to wait 15 to 20 years bond said 
the proposed hypersonic x30 national aerospace plane would soar 
up to 25 times the speed of sound or about 17000 mph fly 
directly into orbit then return to an airport planners also 
envision orient express intercontinental jets traveling up to 
8000 mph to reach any destination in two hours 
the multibilliondollar cost of developing such planes has drawn 
vocal opposition and significant technological obstacles remain 
bond said aircraft manufacturers will be producing jetliners at 
maximum capacity during the decade all of them quieter 
fuelefficient planes 
growing demand means airlines cant retire older noisy 
fuelgobbling jets so noise increasingly will stir political 
controversies he said 
the other significant issue is how to keep these old airplanes 
flying safely bond said its an interesting technical 
challenge and will require work but i dont anticipate worsening 
of the safety record

voters in washington state and michigan may increase education 
taxes quakeweary san franciscans may finance a new stadium to 
keep their pennantwinning baseball team from fleeing and texans 
may spare politicians from having to swear they didnt bribe their 
way into office 
in all voters in 10 states will face 56 statewide issues and 
dozens of local ballot measures tuesday 
texas voters tackle the heaviest load 21 statewide 
propositions including a 500 billion bond issue to extend running 
water and sewers to diseaseridden border towns another to finance 
a record buildup of the states prison system and one to drop a 
113yearold provision requiring state officeholders to publicly 
affirm that they gained their jobs honestly 
among other key contests maine voters will consider a 
nonbinding measure asking if they want to ban cruise missile 
testing within their state and a second asking whether they approve 
of an agreement to dispose of maines nuclear waste at a facility 
in beatty nev 
locally san franciscans will decide whether to build a new 115 
million ballpark to replace aging windswept candlestick park and 
keep the baseball giants from leaving town the measure is strongly 
backed by mayor art agnos but polls suggest the 
multibilliondollar expenses from the recent earthquake have eroded 
support 
a second san francisco ballot measure would allow unmarried 
couples including homosexuals to formally establish their 
relationships as domestic partners entitling them to the same 
funeral and sick leave benefits as married couples 
a large turnout is expected in nearby concord calif where an 
ordinance banning discrimination in housing employment and other 
areas against aids victims was approved by the city council but 
placed on the ballot after protests by outraged residents who 
collected 10000 signatures 
seattle residents will decide a measure that would end forced 
school busing and promote educational choice 
in st louis voters will consider a 4cent property tax 
increase to subsidize the st louis symphony symphony officials 
said the orchestra has gone as far as it can in raising money from 
the wealthy and raising ticket prices but critics in the missouri 
legislature have called the symphony elitist 
voters in new york city under us supreme court order to 
replace its legislative system with a more representative one will 
weigh a complicated charter revision that would strengthen the 
mayor and the city council while scrapping the 89yearold board 
of estimate the measure is expected to pass easily 
in texas there has been little opposition to proposition 2 
which would authorize 500 million in bonds for basic water and 
sewer systems in the substandard border subdivisions called 
colonias an estimated 200000 people live in colonias where 
sewage runs in irrigation ditches and dysentery hepatitis and 
tuberculosis are common 
its sometimes very easy for us who have running water to just 
open the tap and get it and we forget about others who dont 
said amalia lerma of valley interfaith one of the groups backing 
the bond issue 
the package also includes 400 million for water supply water 
quality and flood control projects around the state 
texans also will decide whether to approve 400 million in 
taxbacked bonds for the biggest prison buildup in state history 
along with new mental health institutions juvenile corrections 
facilities and law enforcement 
texas proposition 13 would enshrine a victims bill of rights 
in the state constitution giving victims the ability to confer 
with the prosecutor receive restitution and get information about 
an accuseds conviction sentence imprisonment and release 
another texas measure would eliminate the oath now taken by 
elected officials and others who must swear often during public 
ceremonies in front of family and friends that they didnt bribe 
anyone to get their jobs 
the provision was added to the texas constitution in reaction to 
corruption during the reconstruction era but some now feel the 
oath is outdated and undignified 
in washington state initiative 102 called the childrens 
initiative would boost the states 65cent sales tax by nearly 
a penny to provide at least 360 million for social and education 
programs 
big business led by boeing co recently created a stir by 
contributing about 50000 to opponents of the initiative who 
include republican conservatives opponents brand the initiative a 
disguised teacher raise 
backers mainly teacher and public employee groups and social 
service organizations say the unmet needs of children are 
staggering they range from more child protective caseworkers to 
handle a growing number of kids taken from crackaddicted parents 
to an overwhelmed system for the developmentally disabled to 
overcrowded classrooms as parts of washington experiences a surge 
in growth 
in michigan voters will consider two ballot proposals each of 
which would raise the state sales tax to provide more money for 
schools 
proposal a backed by gov james blanchard teacher 
organizations and major corporations would increase the sales tax 
to 45 percent from 4 percent to generate 400 million more for 
schools 
proposal b with no organized backing and a tiny budget would 
raise the sales tax to 6 percent cut property taxes some 15 
billion and put about 350 million more into schools 
proposal a has money and b doesnt said state sen dan 
degrow a proposal b backer but they both face an uphill fight 
both or neither could pass if both garner majorities the one 
with the larger one would prevail 
the michigan state chamber of commerce wants voters to reject 
both 
the further we get away from the capitol the better the 
reception said chamber vice president richard studley 
david rohde a political science professor at michigan state 
university said there is indeed a lot of cynicism at least 
about anything that involves spending money and increasing taxes to 
spend money its not impossible but any tax increase has a tough 
row to hoe

this is a radio station where arbitron numbers 
are arbitrary everybody has to listen you cant change the dial 
you cant turn it down you cant turn it off 
you can however leave the store 
its rite aid radio a station created solely for the drug store 
chain morning drive afternoon drive it doesnt matter the only 
thing its listeners wheel are shopping carts 
ive had people tell me i was standing in a rite aid and i 
thought i heard your voice and i tell em you did says disc 
jockey dan taylor a country music dj who doubles as the voice of 
rite aid radio 
hes just one of several dozen radio personalities contributing 
their voices to pop radio which allows chain stores from toys r 
us to rickels to shop rite to air their own radio stations each 
day 
pop is not what the stations play its an acronym for point of 
purchase a fastgrowing phenomenon in which the stores create 
their own format for an instore sound system 
they dont want shock jocks or top 40 screamers youll never 
hear gooooood morninnnnnng aampp while cruising the frozen 
food aisle or catch highway to hell cranking out while you 
check the fresh produce 
the musics not oingo boingo it might be frank sinatra jazz 
earl klugh and you have to reflect that said taylor who was 
among the first djs to see the possibilities in pop 
taylor is also the voice for the toys r us station and for 
peoples drug although the company started out in drug stores it 
has since expanded tremendously advertising revenues which were 
at 350000 in fiscal 198586 hit 17 million in 198889 and more 
than 13000 stores play pop radio 
the number of djs have expanded too according to pop radio 
cofounder bob grey there are now 75 disc jockeys providing vocals 
for his company up from a hardy halfdozen when production first 
started 
among them is bob taylor who came to new york looking for a job 
behind the mike in the nations largest media market while he 
waited food emporium radio kept him busy 
and theres jeff shade by day he works behind the scenes at 
allsports wfanam assisting the obstreperous imus in the morning 
his other job is as the warm and friendly nonoffensive host 
of the brooks drugs instore show 
its really a very intimate form of radio you do have a 
captive audience said shade who was a morning drive jock in 
philadelphia before coming to new york 
we try not to be offensive in any way and were conscious of 
that because its strictly an advertising medium said shade 
we not only dont want to offend the sponsors but anybody else 
in the store customers employees anybody 
there are other things which make pop radio different from the 
average station theres no cancellations over low arbitron 
ratings the djs never give the weather the sports the news or 
anything else that is time sensitive and they dont spin 
records 
in some cases the music and chatter are beamed in via 
satellite in other cases the music alone is transmitted that way 
and the djs rap is sent to the stores on tapes which are then cut 
into the tunes 
the rap goes like this rite aid radio hey moms taking care 
of babies is a fulltime job and right here at rite aid we have 
lots of ways to help you help yourself ill be right back with 
more tips after this 
an ad will follow with the dj returning to pitch more items 
then its back to the music generally either adult contemporary 
tunes or background muzak depending on the store there are 12 
minutes of ads each hour 
the stores want you to inflect your own personality but each 
one wants something different said dan taylor one wants 
bright and happy one wants laidback if youre talking like 
this in a rite aid well thats not what they want 
the company has also added features by various personalities 
the best known of the bunch is dr art ulene a sciencemedical 
reporter on nbcs today show but shade recently discovered you 
dont have to be famous to become wellknown via pop radio 
indeed everybody does have to listen 
i was in a brooks store in new england on vacation when i 
asked the guy behind the counter for an item and he recognized my 
voice said shade they were quite shocked that their dj was 
shopping in the store

lee grant is more afraid of boredom than 
anything else and that helps explain how she managed to bring 
three films shes directed to the marketplace this fall 
they are battered a story of domestic violence against 
women hbo homeless about a family whose house burns down 
starring christine lahti and jeff daniels cbs and staying 
together a theatrical movie about family survival in a small 
town hemdale 
notice that all three deal with social problems thats only 
natural with grant an actressdirector who has long been 
associated with causes and who spent 12 years on the film 
industrys blacklist because of it 
grant recently presented staying together at the montreal 
world film festival where it was well received 
what makes lee grant run fear of boredom yes a social 
conscience of course but also a creative drive that has won her 
two academy awards as supporting actress in shampoo 1976 and 
as director of a documentary about the homeless down and out in 
america 1987 
staying together centers on three brothers dermot mulroney 
tim quill sean astin who face a crisis when their father jim 
haynie suddenly sells the family chicken restaurant when the 
father dies the family starts to disintegrate but the boys 
mother melinda dillon brings them back together 
grants producer in all her projects is her second husband joe 
feury staying together proved a surprisingly easy sell for 
them 
i have pictures ive tried to get on for 10 years she said 
i was speaking to john daly of hemdale about another film but he 
wasnt interested because it dealt with south africa he wasnt 
sure of the economic viability i said i had another script which 
was staying together he read it liked it and gave us the 
goahead he said we should go either with names or unknowns 
because he thought it was strange to mix the two we decided to go 
with unknowns for the three boys 
she filmed staying together on a 7 million budget in the 
hamlet of ridgeway sc 
grant a new yorker admittedly knows nothing about smalltown 
life but its like making a documentary i want to make the 
journey i want to find out what its all about and i did the 
townspeople accepted us as part of them 
she grew up in manhattan the daughter of indulgent parents who 
encouraged her selfexpression at 18 she was touring as ado annie 
in a road company of oklahoma in 1949 she drew rave notices 
as meg mundy in sidney kingsleys hit play detective story she 
repeated the role in william wylers film version receiving an 
oscar nomination 
grants career was in high gear when she landed on the 
blacklist apparently because her thenhusband writer arnold 
manoff was suspected of being a communist 
i had to teach when i was blacklisted she said i wasnt 
allowed to act in starting to teach so early i was 19 i 
started dealing with actors and working on their problems i know 
that experience put me on the road to being a director 
its ironic that something i thought was death at the time 
because it took all my ingenue years turned out to be the very 
thing that was my strength 
grant finds a curious parallel between her career and that of 
her daughter dinah manoff who appears in staying together 
dinah got the neil simon play i want to be in pictures for 
which she won a tony then she got the film with walter matthau 
and then there was nothing so she started as a star with great 
acclaim and awards and then nothing grant said 
until she got the series the empty nest it was a real 
struggle for her a kind of trial by fire i think if she had 
gotten everything as easily as she did at the start she would not 
be either the person or the actress that she is today i saw her go 
through the pain and the confusion of why did they want me so much 
one year and not want me at all the next 
in going through all that and keeping on studying and finding 
the places in herself that she liked i think she has become one of 
the strongest people i know 
what happens to the actress lee grant when the director becomes 
so busy 
she gets lost grant sighed every once in a while she 
starts to cry she starts to get funny feelings that are very 
uncomfortable and i hear myself saying i dont feel enough 
whats happening to me 
i dont connect it to the fact that im not feeling on the 
level that i feel when i act thats when i do something this year 
i did the achille lauro and got all my suffering out of my 
system i felt much better and became a person i could live with 
again

she was 16 and home for the holidays from 
finishing school he was 17 and an andover senior decked out in a 
tux for the christmas dance at a greenwich conn country club 
it was december 1941 three weeks earlier america had gone to 
war george poppy bush already had decided to enlist as soon as 
he turned 18 
but on this evening his attention was drawn to the tall 
slender girl with wavy reddishbrown hair twirling around the 
dance floor in a greenandred holiday dress with one of his tennis 
buddies 
the friend was happy to oblige bush with an introduction to 
barbara pierce of nearby rye ny 
before they reached the floor the band switched from a glenn 
miller tune to a waltz that was beyond bushs dancing ability so 
the couple sat down and talked 
and talked 
a few nights later on their first date bush borrowed his 
folks big car the one with the radio to fill the air in case 
conversation faltered 
but as writer donnie radcliffe recounts in a new biography of 
barbara bush he need not have bothered 
years later he would tease that she started talking that night 
and hadnt stopped since writes radcliffe in simply barbara 
bush a portrait of americas candid first lady 
the book follows the bushes from their wartime marriage to the 
oil fields of texas to the political career that led them from 
congress to china and now after 29 moves in 44 years of marriage 
to the white house 
radcliffe who has covered first ladies and the east wing of the 
white house for the washington post since 1969 recalls bush saying 
on a campaign flight last fall that if he won theres one 
prediction ill make america will fall in love with barbara 
bush 
america did adds radcliffe in no time at all her white 
hair her wrinkles her size14 figure and her fake pearls became 
the new standards by which american women could measure themselves 
and hope to measure up 
she clearly cuts a different figure than the petite exactress 
nancy reagan who last occupied 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
as mrs bush quipped at a 1986 charity dinner as you know we 
have a lot in common she fights drugs i fight illiteracy she 
wears a size three sos my leg 
born in new york on june 8 1925 she was the third of marvin 
and pauline pierces four children 
he was an engineer who turned to publishing she was in 
barbaras memory an absolutely ravishing woman with a green 
thumb an inveterate joiner of civic causes and a spendthrift the 
pierces lived well but beyond their means in a fivebedroom brick 
home in upscale rye 
when barbaras older sister martha went off to smith college 
vogue immortalized her on its cover as college girl of the year 
back home barbara was a tomboy 5foot8 and 148 pounds at age 
12 she recalls looking like porky pig 
at ashley hall the finishing school in charleston sc she 
set school records at speedknitting swimming underwater 2 times 
across the pool and according to radcliffe eating the most 
hot buttured biscuits in one meal without being caught 
after that holiday dance the teenage couple had a whirlwind 
if long distance romance with the letters postmarked andover 
turning up almost daily in barbaras school mailbox he took her to 
his senior prom at the prestigious prep school outside boston 
a few weeks later bush joined the navy and began the training 
that would make him its youngest pilot 
after barbaras graduation in 1943 she spent 17 days with bush 
and his family at their oceanfront home in maine where she was a 
hit with dorothy walker bush the clans tennisplaying matriarch 
barbara dropped out of smith college in 1944 after her freshman 
year planning to marry bush in december 
on sept 2 1944 bushs torpedo bomber with barbara 
painted on its side was shot down by japanese gunners during a 
raid on chichi jima 
bush bailed out after dropping his four 500pound bombs the two 
crewman with him didnt make it an american submarine rescued the 
flier who returned home on christmas eve with a distinguished 
flying cross and 58 combat missions 
the wedding took place a few weeks late on jan 6 1945 
bush was mustered out of the navy in august and enrolled at 
yale barbara worked parttime at the yale coop and boasts that 
by the time we moved from yale i knew how to wash diapers and 
cook dinner 
george walker bush the first of their six kids was born in 
july 1946 
bush breezed through yale in three years making phi beta kappa 
as an economics major captain of the baseball team president of 
delta kappa epsilon fraternity and member of skull and bones the 
elite secret student society 
they headed off to odessa texas to embark on a career in the 
oil fields 
pauline pierce kept sending her daughter tide until barbara 
convinced her mother the grocery stores in west texas were bigger 
than the ones in rye mrs pierce was killed in a car accident in 
1949 
tragedy struck again in 1953 when doctors told the bushes their 
3yearold daughter robin was dying of leukemia they took her to 
sloankettering memorial hospital in new york where barbara seldom 
left her side the child died 10 weeks before her 4th birthday 
her hair began going gray during robins illness for years at 
the suggestion of her motherinlaw she dyed the gray away but 
abandoned that in 1970 tired of the greenish hue her hair acquired 
whenever she swam in a pool 
mrs bush was always a fulltime mother ferrying the children 
to little league games and myriad other activities packing them 
into the station wagon to drive to kennebunkport each summer and 
meting out most of the discipline 
she said earlier this year that when the family nest finally 
emptied i went through sort of a difficult time really 
because suddenly womens lib had made me feel that my life had been 
wasted 
the blues did not last long she stepped up her volunteer 
activities and discovered a favorite cause literacy 
i once spent the summer thinking of all the things that 
bothered me teen pregnancy drugs everything and i realized 
everything would be better if more people could read and write 
said mrs bush who also had experienced the difficulties of 
helping son neil overcome dyslexia 
she is often credited as serving as a goad to her husbands 
social conscience 
at times she has made headlines including her rhymes with 
rich crack about geraldine ferraro in 1984 and support for a ban 
on ak47s after a man killed five children in a stockton calif 
schoolyard 
she has since tried to steer clear of public policy statements 
that muzzle is nothing new she told reporters 
i muzzled myself about 1967 when george went into the 
congress she said its a decision i made many years ago that 
when i disagreed with george bush i tell him in private

for it is incredible how hateful to noncatholics in all parts 
of america is the very name of bishop 
the rev ferdinand farmer american missionary 1773 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
wearing the bishops mitre in the roman catholic church in the 
united states has never been easy 
from the day in 1789 when pope pius vi established the diocese 
of baltimore and named john carroll the first us catholic bishop 
the church here has had to defend the american way of life before 
the holy see and to calm the fears of noncatholics that it was 
controlled by a foreign power 
as its bishops meet in baltimore this week to celebrate the 
bicentennial of the catholic hierarchy in the united states with a 
conservative pope seeking greater central authority and the 
abortion battle fueling critics claims that the church wants to 
set moral standards for the nation the church is still trying to 
find its place in the american experiment in democracy 
i think the current leadership of the us catholic conference 
needs to continue to articulate to the holy see the unique 
characteristics of the united states said bishop james malone of 
youngstown ohio past president of the national conference of 
catholic bishops the task of carroll visavis the holy see and 
the task of the current church leadership visavis the holy see is 
basically the same 
but this time around the american church is no longer the new 
kid on the block 
the 53 millionmember catholic church in the united states has 
grown from a persecuted minority in an isolated outpost to the 
nations largest religious group and one of the most influential 
voices of catholicism in the world 
if a pope today tried to correct the errors of americanism 
with a scolding papal encyclical as pope leo xiii did in 1899 
it just wont be paid attention to said jay dolan a historian 
at notre dame 
the united states revolutionary experiment in democracy made 
its mark on the catholic hierarchy from the start 
heeding pleas from 18th century jesuit missionaries such as 
ferdinand farmer that appointing a bishop would only antagonize 
americans suspicious of the churchs independence from europes 
catholic nations the pope did not appoint carroll as the first 
american bishop until 1789 a century and a half after the church 
was established in maryland 
one of the first issues the new bishop had to face was 
trusteeism following the example of protestant churches around 
them many catholic churches were run by lay trustees who even 
took upon themselves the role of selecting priests carroll trod 
lightly on that issue leaving to his successors the battles to 
reestablish the hierarchys right to appoint priests 
as american catholicism grew with waves of immigrants in the 
19th century groups such as the knownothing party and the 
american protestant association forced the still young and 
struggling church to defend itself against charges it was aiming 
for ecclesiastical control of the new nation 
catholics also experienced more basic persecution in 1834 
rumors that nuns were murdering illegitimate children in convent 
basements prompted rioters to burn the ursuline convent in 
charlestown mass ten years later in philadelphia 13 people died 
in the torchings of two catholic churches 
the challenges confronting the church already had brought its 
leaders together in unprecedented fashion as early as 1810 
american bishops gathered again a highly unusual thing to do in 
the church at that time in baltimore in 1852 1866 and 1884 
at one meeting the bishops took their first significant social 
stand deciding to defend the knights of labor the first national 
union and with a majority catholic membership against charges it 
was communistic cardinal james gibbons of baltimore appeared 
before the holy see in 1887 and averted a papal condemnation of the 
knights 
in the late 1800s rome became concerned about the influence on 
other nations of such american ideals as religious liberty and 
churchstate separation and the americanist controversy 
erupted 
pope leo xiiis encyclical decrying the idea that the church 
should adapt its doctrine to the modern age and that the american 
church could be different put a stop to doctrinal ferment for 
decades but us church leaders continued to organize 
in 1919 the national catholic welfare conference was founded 
the bishops program of social reconstruction which opposed child 
labor and urged minimum wage laws and other social reforms was 
published that year catholics in other nations didnt begin this 
sort of activism until the 1950s 
the church in the united states was very conscious of the way 
the us was organized politically said monsignor joesph 
gremillion a scholarinresidence at notre dame the church 
leadership in the united states felt the need of comparing notes 
consulting with one another taking positions 
the catholic conference in this country became a model for 
national and regional church groups elsewhere after the 196165 
second vatican council gave official recognition to national 
conferences the national conference of catholic bishops was formed 
in 1966 
the vatican however may not have been ready for the influence 
wielded by the us bishops 
the papacy which had assumed that stands on international 
issues were its prerogative was somewhat startled by the 
american bishops pastoral letters this decade on nuclear war and 
the economy said gremillion a former vatican official 
the bishops place in the universal church is still debated 
between members of the american hierarchy and the vatican 
when john paul ii met with the us bishops in los angeles in 
1987 he called on them to lift up unpopular catholic teachings 
saying it is a grave error to consider dissent from the holy 
see totally compatible with being a good catholic 
he was told in turn by archbishop rembert g weakland of 
milwaukee that an authoritarian style is counterproductive and 
such authority for the most part then becomes ignored archbishop 
john r quinn of san francisco said we cannot fulfill our task 
simply by an uncritical application of solutions designed in past 
ages for problems which have qualitatively changed or which did not 
exist in the past 
still the overall trend is conservative according to some 
church observers we are now in a period of reaction to that 
earlier period of the second vatican council said the rev 
thomas reese of the woodstock theological center at georgetown 
university 
but in the united states an educated catholic laity that has 
stepped from the pews into the inner sanctum in roles ranging from 
parish administrators to eucharistic ministers is not turning back 
some church leaders say 
it amazes me how much people want to do in the church said 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati vice president of the 
bishops conference i think thats wonderful and i could see how 
that could be scary 
if that gets off the track it could be a mess i dont think 
its off the track american catholics dont want it to get off the 
track

when marguerite kirk graduated from law school she got a typical 
job for rookie attorneys in 1967 counseling a small number of 
clients through the drudgery of personal bankruptcy 
at that time the legal profession had bestowed 
bottomofthebarrel status on personal bankruptcy work because it 
was tedious and timeconsuming 
we used to meet in the basement of the courthouse kirk 
said recalling those days when she was an inexperienced lawyer at 
a small firm in augusta ga youd look up and see the pipes 
uncovered or dripping i knew i had to get my feet wet but this was 
ridiculous 
today kirk handles a booming bankruptcy business from an office 
in fort worth texas she says the stigma once associated with such 
cases has diminished largely because the number of people swamped 
in debt has soared and changes in federal laws have made bankruptcy 
filing easier 
more debtswamped people have been turning to the courts for 
relief ranging from poor dirt farmers to creditcard addicts to 
former tycoons such as the hunt brothers and extexas gov john b 
connally 
between 1984 and the fiscal year ended june 30 personal 
bankruptcies more than doubled nationwide to 580459 from 282105 
many attorneys say they expect to see a lot more bankruptcy court 
refugees 
that means more business for lawyers who are among the first in 
line to get paid when a debtors assets are sold to satisfy bills 
but the personal bankruptcy explosion poses a threat to creditors 
who stand to lose billions when unpaid bills are delayed or 
dismissed by bankruptcy courts 
in response creditors have been aggressively going after assets 
of people whose bankruptcy filings they consider fraudulent or 
abusive 
visa usa the nations largest credit card company began a 
program earlier this year organizing banks to challenge bankruptcy 
petitions in court the project began in southern california an 
area of frequent filings and has expanded to eight other states 
theres no word yet on its success 
the american bankers association a trade organization for 
commercial banks recently began a campaign to educate the public 
on the use of credit and steps to avoid bankruptcy 
the association emphasizes that a filing will damage a persons 
credit rating for years which could mean big problems in getting 
loans or even another job 
some people are taking advantage of the system and its 
hurting the industry said virginia stafford an aba spokeswoman 
kenneth r crone head of visas bankruptcy recovery program 
said member banks lost 15 billion from personal bankruptcy 
filings last year nearly half that from a tiny number of debtors 
who ran up bills they never meant to pay 
crone said some bankruptcy filers deliberately hide assets or 
overstate expenses while others may have the means to repay debts 
but decide to file for bankruptcy anyway usually at a lawyers 
urging 
robert w johnson director of purdue universitys credit 
research center said its most recent survey of 1200 bankruptcy 
filers found half had no hope of repaying debts but 20 percent 
could have repaid all nonmortgage debts within three years and 
threefifths doubled their net worth after filing 
were by far the most lenient country in the world in many 
countries your debt is never forgiven said johnson in fact 
america was settled by people who in many cases were fleeing 
their creditors in europe 
many lawyers and financial planners argue that the vast number 
of personal bankruptcy filers are up against a financial wall for 
reasons ranging from job loss to medical crisis to divorce 
they say banks should share blame for the high number of 
bankruptcy filings because they are often too lenient in issuing 
credit cards 
while consumer spending may drive an economy it also drives 
many onto very thin ice said william kennedy a fort worth 
psychologist whose clients include personal bankruptcy filers 
these artificial needs are driven up in us by all the advertising 
big business does 
under federal laws debtors can surrender some assets to repay 
part of their debt under a chapter 7 petition known as straight 
bankruptcy or keep their assets and repay debt over a three to 
fiveyear period under chapter 13 
many creditors prefer chapter 13 but attorneys report that a 
far larger number of filings are made under chapter 7 than 13 in 
kirks practice the ratio of 7s to 13s is 9to1 
the reason is that the majority who seek bankruptcy court have 
experienced a major financial blow and hold little prospect of 
making payments 
even for those who got into trouble from other reasons such as 
extravagant spending its quicker to file under chapter 7 and the 
effect on credit ratings is the same attorneys claim 
some states have laws that prevent nonsecured creditors such 
as creditcard companies from seizing personal assets under 
chapter 7 
william g a 44yearold developer working in southwestern 
florida found the chapter 7 petition he recently filed quickly 
solved his financial woes the developer said he wanted to avoid 
legal wrangling and millions of dollars in liability over texas 
property holdings that soured 
he said that by surrendering his interest in an investment 
partnership he removed himself from liability but didnt hurt his 
credit rating because he kept current on all other debts the 
ability to isolate problem debts is another advantage of filing 
under chapter 7 attorneys say 
some creditors seeking to avoid dealing with personal 
bankruptcies have been relying on bankruptcyprediction models 
provided by major creditrating bureaus to screen potential 
borrowers 
creditors also have been referring delinquent debtors to 
counseling says martin neilson a senior vice president at 
seattlefirst national bank and a member of abas bankruptcy task 
force 
donald l badders president of the nonprofit national 
foundation for consumer credit said 70 percent of those seeking 
help from its 400 counseling offices can be prevented from filing 
bankruptcy 
the counselors act as intermediaries between debtors and 
creditors arranging small monthly repayments last year the 
foundation recovered 242 million for businesses 
scott l shires a denver money manager agrees that most 
clients with money problems can avoid bankruptcy if they follow a 
strict budget but he says uncooperative creditors can unravel the 
bestlaid plans 
that happened to tom n 41 who owned a truckleasing business 
in denver until rapid expansion kept him behind in his bills 
he said he reduced most of his 500000 in debts after three 
years but two impatient creditors forced him into bankruptcy 
court he lost his business and his 250000 home and was estranged 
from his family 
i grew too fast he said i didnt think it was greed i 
was grabbing the silver spoon and using other people to do it

here is a brief look at what to expect after deciding to file 
for personal bankruptcy under chapter 7 or chapter 13 of federal 
bankruptcy law according to legal experts 
you must first fill out and file with a bankruptcy court in 
your area a petition and several other forms detailing assets 
liabilities and living expenses those filing a chapter 13 petition 
must also include a debtrepayment plan in accordance with their 
income and expenses 
the filing immediately stops your creditors from trying to 
collect what you owe them thereby temporarily preventing them from 
garnishing your wages or seizing assets but a landlord for 
instance eventually may receive permission from the courts to 
evict you 
if youve pledged property as collateral for a loan you may 
have to surrender the designated property to the creditor or make 
arrangements to pay for it during or after bankruptcy 
legal control of your financial problems is in the hands of the 
bankruptcy court which appoints a bankruptcy trustee usually 
an attorney or an accountant nothing can be sold or paid without 
the courts consent 
bankruptcy has no effect on some debts including child 
support alimony most taxes and recent student loans 
someone who cosigns a loan for you will receive the same 
protection as you under a chapter 13 petition but not under chapter 
7 
in chapter 7 proceedings a creditors meeting is called after 
which the trustee collects the property that can be taken from you 
and sold to pay them depending on which state you live in some of 
your property can be exempt such as household furnishings jewelry 
or clothing the process takes three to six months to complete and 
commonly requires one trip to the courthouse 
in chapter 13 you must begin making payments to the trustee 
under your debtrepayment plan within 30 days most of your debts 
must be paid off in monthly installments within three to five 
years although your trustee could provide a grace period under 
certain circumstances 
you can change your mind after you file either petition and ask 
the court to dismiss your case also if for some reason you cant 
finish a chapter 13 plan and your trustee wont modify your plan 
you can switch to a chapter 7 provided you havent completed such 
a petition within the previous six years 
your bankruptcy will remain on your credit reports for around 
seven years

is liquidated and distributed among creditors by a courtappointed 
trustee to satisfy debts in some cases action can be brought 
against a debtor by creditors cant be filed more than once in six 
years 
chapter 9 applies exclusively to municipalities it was

five years after aids patients began to complain 
of muddled thinking and the aids virus was found to be infecting 
their brains the condition known as aids dementia remains a puzzle 
we still dont know why it happens said dr richard 
johnson head of the johns hopkins school of medicine neurology 
department until researchers do understand that learning to treat 
or prevent it will be difficult 
the antiaids drug azt has been shown to reverse some of the 
symptoms but doctors have no specific treatment for the dementia 
itself even the diagnosis can be tricky in the early stages when 
it can resemble depression or other kinds of dementia as it 
worsens it reveals more characteristic symptoms 
some patients notice their handwriting is changing said alicia 
boccellari director of neuropsychology at san francisco general 
hospital they complain of leg weakness the result of a 
malfunction in the brain not nerves of the leg 
the aids virus attacks the subcortical areas of the brain 
which govern behavior and emotions apathy irritability and a lack 
of spontaneity result accompanied in some patients by more 
dramatic symptoms these people will have an acute psychotic 
state manifested by euphoria and hyperactivity boccellari said 
they become very grandiose and delusional 
the virus doesnt generally affect the cortex the seat of 
language however so patients generally have little trouble with 
speech it can be misleading because they seem so articulate 
she said 
as the dementia progresses patients often complain less about 
it in the midstage of the dementia they dont know theyre 
having any problems 
this is due to the brain damage it becomes difficult to 
convince them they shouldnt be living independently they 
shouldnt be driving a car 
researchers disagree over how many aids patients will develop 
dementia and exactly when in the course of aids it can strike 
dr justin mcarthur a johns hopkins neurologist and the leader 
of a national institutes of health study on aids dementia estimates 
that 20 percent of patients with fullblown aids will have the 
dementia 
dr richard price a neurologist at the memorial sloankettering 
cancer institute in new york believes twothirds of those patients 
will have it 
both believe serious symptoms of dementia are uncommon early in 
the aids infection some researchers claim however to find subtle 
signs early 
in 1987 igor grant j hamp atkinson and colleagues at the 
university of california san diego reported minor 
neuropsychological problems in 44 percent of a group of generally 
healthy homosexual men infected with the aids virus 
the disagreement between atkinsons group and mcarthurs could 
reflect differences in the tests they used atkinson believes 
mcarthurs tests werent sensitive enough mcarthur thinks 
atkinsons were too sensitive 
other unsettled questions involve how the aids virus gets into 
the brain and precisely what it does when it gets there 
the virus enters the brain soon after infection studies show 
but can sit quietly for years before causing problems it could 
enter through the blood or by way of the cerebrospinal fluid that 
bathes the brain and spinal cord 
the blood notion arose when scientists discovered similarities 
between the aids virus and visna virus which causes a 
dementialike illness in sheep and enters sheep brains in white 
blood cells called macrophages in this socalled trojan horse 
theory dangerous invaders hide in a harmlesslooking blood cell 
most of the damage seems to occur in the socalled white matter 
of the brain bundles of nerve cell axons that carry electrical 
messages infection is centered in certain brain cells called glial 
cells which serve as a glue 
the damage appears to be temporary however destroyed brain 
cells cant grow back and azt reverses some symptoms of dementia 
indicating that there is not a considerable loss of nerve 
cells said michael ba oldstone of the scripps clinic in la 
jolla california 
the distinction between damage and destruction is important but 
hasnt helped researchers figure out whats causing the dementia 
some scientists believe infected macrophages that enter the 
brain spill out some unknown toxin the result of an aidstriggered 
malfunction another notion is that the virus doesnt damage the 
brain directly but produces proteins that are toxic to the brain 
a final intriguing idea has become the most controversial 
candace pert a former national institute of mental health 
pharmacologist who has set up her own aids research foundation 
believes that a protein called gp120 in the aids viruss outer 
membrane or skin is a potent toxin that blocks the action of 
a chemical essential for nerve cell growth 
the growth chemical vasoactive intestinal peptide or vip is 
similar to gp120 the substances share a tiny string of five 
building blocks called amino acids pert believes that string is 
the chemical key that the virus uses to enter glial cells 
when vip binds with glial cells it triggers the production of a 
growth factor that nerve cells need she said when gp120 binds 
with the glial cells the cells cannot produce growth factor the 
result is dementia 
pert attributes controversy over her theory to its radical 
nature its a breakthrough in the field its so revolutionary 
it has met with incredulity 
i think shes on to something said boccellari 
i think its a very very intriguing idea said mcarthur 
but at this stage its still that an idea what pert must 
show he said is that the virus produces a lot of gp120 in the 
brain 
pert tested her theory by giving patients a synthesized version 
of the five amino acids this drug peptide t was meant to 
stick to glial cells in a way that would let them function and keep 
gp120 out peptide t alleviated some of the dementia providing 
partial confirmation of her theory she said 
her strongest critic is william haseltine of the dana farber 
cancer institute in boston who has studied peptide t and concluded 
it has no beneficial effects the disagreement remains unresolved 
the importance of aids dementia has been so strongly emphasized 
that mcarthur worries that concerned overzealous doctors may be 
finding it in patients who dont have it other things can look 
like it he said and some of them unlike aids dementia may be 
curable 
recently we had a patient who came to us with symptoms of 
dementia he said it turned out he was simply taking an 
antidepressant medication and the levels of the antidepressant 
were too high when the drug was stopped the dementia 
disappeared 
in cases of true aids dementia researchers dont expect such 
easy answers one of the problems is we dont really have animals 
to work with that have something similar said price its 
going to be a slow process i havent seen any breakthrough

computers like those in new car 
engines will help navy divers swim deeper and stay down longer 
without telltale bubbles 
experimental diving gear incorporating a microprocessor is under 
development at the naval coastal systems center and should be ready 
for use by early 1993 said steve gorin project manager for what 
is dubbed the ex19 
a diver using ordinary gear can stay down 100 feet for about a 
halfhour with this system we can get in excess of six hours 
at in excess of 300 feet said tony ramey head of the centers 
diving systems branch 
just how much in excess the navy wont say 
workers at the center have been told not to disclose specific 
uses for the ex19 although they could say it will be the first 
equipment used by all three types of navy divers fleet explosive 
ordnance disposal and special warfare 
with regular scuba gear known as an open system a diver 
breathes air from a tank and exhales it into the water creating 
the bubbles most of the air is wasted as the body consumes only a 
small portion of the oxygen in each breath 
the deeper a diver goes the more air is wasted and the harder 
it is to beathe with an open system because air becomes denser the 
diver has to breathe more air to get the same amount of oxygen and 
suck harder to get the dense air 
the ex19 is a closed or rebreather system that recycles air 
instead of letting it escape into the water gorin said it uses 
two tanks one with pure oxygen and the other with ordinary air or 
with a helium and oxygen mixture for depths greater than 150 feet 
a scrubber removes carbon dioxide from the used air and 
additional oxygen is injected as needed before it is breathed again 
through oversized hoses the diver breathes as he normally would on 
the surface gorin said 
the navy already uses rebreathers and at least one is available 
commercially but the ex19 advances the concept by using the 
microprocessor to control the recycling operation and handle other 
data the diver wears a liquid crystal display unit on one wrist to 
read depth and tank pressure 
if something goes wrong idiot lights like those on the 
dashboard of a car flash inside the face mask and an alarm 
attached behind an ear goes off 
members of the development team are civilians but many 
including bill gavin lead mechanical engineer and a 
recordsetting cave diver and gorin have had navy dive training 
that lets them participate in testing 
its really strange to get into it because it makes no 
noise gorin said 
gavin also a frequent user of open system gear said he had 
developed habits he didnt know he had until he tried out the 
ex19 when you get into a rig like this you have to almost 
reteach yourself your ingrained training says you should breathe a 
certain way and you dont have to do that 
scuba divers can fill their lungs increasing their boyancy to 
stop a descent or hover or can exhale to sink but those tricks 
dont work with a closed system when you inhale you are simply 
transferring volume out of this rig and into your lungs and your 
net boyancy doesnt change gavin said 
opensystem bubbles can scare fish away but theyre less 
frightened of the rebreather gavin said for that reason and its 
other advantages rebreathers are used by some research scientists 
but their civilian application is limited by cost a commercial 
unit goes for more than 20000 and gorin estimated the production 
version of the ex19 will cost about 30000

shes been called the chicken feed 
queen by schoolmates and doubted by scientists but alice havens 
remains undeterred in her quest to help millions of eggloving 
americans 
every day around 5 am the 17yearold high school student 
slips out of bed and into a pair of boots by the kitchen door then 
heads for her backyard where she feeds 25 hens a special formula 
to cut the cholesterol in eggs 
cholesterollowering research also is going on in laboratories 
where researchers with advanced degrees and heavy funding measure 
results with fancy instruments havens experiment started out as a 
project for the science fair 
sitting at the kitchen table she opens a notebook to the typed 
pages that detail her research she says the charts show that the 
special feed has dropped the cholesterol count 22 to 27 percent 
and that its going down even further 
some scientists are skeptical questioning her testing methods 
and results dr edward naber whos been doing egg experiments for 
30 years at ohio state university doesnt think her numbers are 
significant 
havens who has applied for a patent is pushing on her words 
get stronger her pace quicker when asked to respond to skeptics 
well thats your opinion and ive got mine and just because of 
what you said isnt going to make me stop 
the havens family lives in a big wooden house tucked deep in the 
woods in sherman with two horses a collie two cats and alices 
25 chickens 
science has occupied her since seventh grade when the 
papiermache volcanoes she made with her best friend hannah 
roberts won a prize at the science horizons fair in danbury we 
built all these volcanoes and we had a backdrop and everything 
with moss and paint and it was a huge mess 
inspired by her teacher john halloran she kept entering the 
fair studying vision in horses one year chicken feed in another 
in early tests she gave her hens different diets like sunflower 
seeds and oyster shells she started testing for cholesterol when 
she entered new milford high school 
what i did was i tested different things on the hens things 
farmers sometimes fed to see if the cholesterol level would change 
in any way 
she hit pay dirt with the third diet an ingredient she decided 
to try and wont disclose because a friend of her sister had a 
lot before the hens laid jumbo eggs with 388 milligrams of 
cholesterol after it was 340 
havens says the level has dropped even more but she wont 
release the figures until the next phase of the experiment is over 
shes also trying to pinpoint exactly what in the feed is working 
many researchers have tried to cut eggs cholesterol but failed 
to find a safe cheap diet said naber a food science professor 
he questioned havens figures and said a large connecticut egg has 
202 milligrams of cholesterol and the national average is 213 
havens sticks by her guns saying she started out with bigger 
eggs and hasnt relied on us department of agriculture standards 
as a benchmark shes also egged on so to speak by the accolades 
shes won in the last two years 
at the kitchen table she flips through a scrapbook to 
certificates and letters from the american heart association and 
the nutmeg institute of food technologists and mementos like an 
luggage tag from her trip to knoxville tenn for the 
international science fair her booty includes an encyclopedia set 
five shares of stock from united technologies corp a leather 
briefcase five trophies on her bedroom dresser four framed 
certificates on the wall above her bed and enough cash to pay for 
the experiment 
last summer havens went to london for a science symposium with 
800 students from around the world she presented her research 
made friends toured castles and intiated a walkout at one 
session when a boy from ireland made disparaging remarks about vice 
president dan quayle she was reprimanded for taking 400 students 
with her when she left in disgust 
shes also learned to handle the kidding she gets from some 
schoolmates when i first started my sophomore year i got a lot 
of ribbing for it but now that shes onto something big it 
doesnt bother me anymore

tiny detectors using offtheshelf 
parts and cheap 9volt batteries can do a better job of spotting 
intruders at military bases than the vietnam warera sensors that 
weigh 140 pounds use 170 batteries 
the miniaturized system using eight seismic detectors the size 
of cigarette packs a portable monitor two infrared detectors and 
a beacon is already being used by the army air force and marine 
corps said dori miller supervisor of the sensor systems division 
at sandia national laboratories 
theyre not the whole answer but they do give you a first 
alert where to look and when to look miller said a 
marine gets tired gets hungry may have to go to the mens room 
and sensors dont do that 
the seismic detectors are buried around a perimeter with only 
their antennas above ground and transmit codes to the handheld 
monitor the infrared detectors can signal a break in an infrared 
beam and the beacon sends a status report on the whole system 
every 10 minutes the system is remotecontrolled 
depending on the setting the seismic units can pick out 
anything from personnel to tanks miller said the system costs 
less than 3000 compared with the 12000 to 15000 for the 
older detectors that were used 
sandia researchers also are working on a magnetic detector and 
one that would be able to detect a warm body she said

tangs fine but astronauts may want 
something to put on their cereal so researchers are trying to find 
a way to store milk in space 
nasa has decided that dairy products are necessary for 
longterm space habitation but needed a product that could be 
stored without refrigeration said paul savello an assistant 
professor of nutrition and food sciences 
when the space agency approached utah state university its 
center for dairy food technology had an answer 
ultrahightemperature sterilization which shoots steam through 
milk or passes milk over a hot plate to kill bacteria 
uht milk products can be stored warm on shelves for years 
although they taste better if theyre cooled before serving 
savello said researchers also are working on yogurt custard 
cheesecake and citrusflavored milk drinks 
if nasa comes up with a pouch that can withstand the needed 
heat a pouch of milk will be on a december shuttle flight he said 
the steam method works instantaneously by shooting steam into 
the milk at about 285 degrees holding it at that temperature for 
four seconds then using vacuum to withdraw the excess moisture 
from the steam using large hot metal plates takes longer but 
doesnt require the extra step of removing steam

developed in france shows promise despite some worries about its 
safety 
sousvide french for under vacuum and pronounced 
sooveed promises delicious and nutritious food for just the 
effort of heating water 
sousvide foods are enticing because taste is preserved food 
is spared the extreme cold of freezing and the extreme heat used in 
canning 
fresh raw ingredients are sealed in a plastic pouch and the air 
removed the pouch is then cooked and immediately refrigerated the 
consumer has only to reheat and open the pouch many chefs say they 
cannot taste the difference between freshcooked foods and 
sousvide 
in france it really was quite wonderful especially the fish 
i remember tasting quite marvelous all the aromas are kept inside 
and the moisture said paula wolfert a new york cookbook writer 
but while the process has been successful in europe its 
advantages are also what raise concerns 
the food and drug administration recently warned that sousvide 
foods are fraught with danger because the oxygenfree 
atmosphere provides a breeding ground for bacteria that can cause 
food poisoning freezing and boiling inhibit or kill bacteria and 
refrigerated foods such as dairy products become rancid before they 
become dangerous the fda said 
putrid smell is gods early warning system that food has 
turned rotten said tom schwarz assistant director for program 
development of the fdas food protection branch 
the agency said sousvide cooking can kill microorganisms that 
would provide a smelly warning but leave dangerous bacteria 
unharmed to prevent problems sousvide foods must be kept 
continually refrigerated leaving open the possibility of problems 
during distribution and storage 
it was designed for use in restaurants for people who wanted 
to have sauces ready to go it was not designed for a distribution 
system said theron downs a professor of packaging at michigan 
state university 
sousvide should not be practiced by anyone other than 
registered thermal process establishments where they know there 
are food scientists not just cooks or somebody in the back room of 
a delicatessen 
david shick executive vice president and cofounder of culinary 
brands inc of sausalito calif one of the few us companies 
specializing in sousvide expects it to become common in 
supermarkets a real consumer education has to go on about pouch 
products and the goodness and wholesomeness of pouch products he 
said 
wolfert sees promise in sousvide to feed schoolchildren and the 
poor theres so many things that could be done with sousvide if 
they stop trying to make this gourmet if we would just make 
sousvide of earthy foods cheap foods 
culinary brands ships several dozen dishes with a 21day shelf 
life to restaurants hotels and delicatessens it lets 
restaurants that dont have highpriced chefs serve foods like rack 
of lamb or salmon linguini 
many foods now being processed sousvide are fancy but shick 
said that will change and that his company also makes macaroni and 
cheese and beef stew 
food cooked sousvide should not be allowed to reach a 
temperature higher than 40 degrees downs said one way to ensure 
safety is a time and temperature monitor on packages for a few 
cents a package these devices indicate usually by a change of 
color if the contents have been too warm for too long 
culinary brands uses such monitors on its products

president bush has unveiled a package of trade 
initiatives to help create economic alternatives to drug 
trafficking for the andean nations of south america 
the initiative grew out of a promise bush made to colombian 
president virgilio barco at a sept 28 meeting to expand economic 
trade as part of the war on drugs 
the white house said wednesday the initiatives will include 
expanding the list of agricultural and industrial products from the 
andean nations allowed into the united states dutyfree it gave no 
specifics 
the white house said bush was proposing bilateral and regional 
initiatives to bolster trade with colombia bolivia peru ecuador 
and venezuela 
i believe that through increased trade we can make a 
contribution to the creation of economic alternatives to drug 
trafficking bush said in a statement healthy economies are 
the only lasting solution for eliminating the drug trade and 
substituting legitimate trade 
bush said we are prepared to do all that we can to enhance 
the benefits the countries of the region enjoy under our 
generalized system of preferences including an immediate review 
to consider the addition of new products both agricultural and 
industrial to the program 
those preferences provide breaks on tariffs for developing 
nations 
bush said the united states was also prepared to explore 
possibilities for expanding textiles trade and giving technical 
trade assistance to the andean nations 
he said the united states is committed to build on the 
political consensus to negotiate a new international coffee 
agreement that corrects the fundamental problems with the previous 
agreement 
coffee prices have plunged much to the distress of colombia and 
other major coffeeproducers since the united states quit the last 
agreement in july 
the united states was upset with restrictions on sales of 
certain types of coffee favored by american consumers and with 
lower prices on coffee charged east bloc nations outside the 
agreement 
he also said the united states will seek to accelerate tariff 
negotiations with participants in international trade 
liberalization talks now underway in geneva and to support 
multilateral development banks efforts to promote meaningful 
trade policy reforms in the andean nations 
bush said he also planned to consult with the major us trading 
partners including canada japan and the european community on 
ways to help the andean nations 
our goal must be to help create an environment where 
entrepreneurship can flourish and comparative advantages can be 
successfully pursued in competitive world markets the president 
said

the nations economic growth continued to vary 
from slow to moderate early this fall the federal reserve said in 
a survey that did not mention any inflationary problems 
consumer spending is mixed with a number of districts 
describing retail sales as steady to growing slowly the survey 
summary said wednesday manufacturing activity is also mixed 
with some districts reporting weakenss in orders and shipments 
weakness of construction in some markets contrasts with 
evidence of some improvement elsewhere resource industries 
including the energy sector appear to be improving as is 
agriculture generally it continued 
the survey by the 12 district banks is compiled by the fed every 
six weeks to prepare for meetings of the federal open market 
committee the feds monetary policysetting arm the next meeting 
is nov 14 
recent economic indicators show sluggish economic growth 
following fed moves to ease inflationary pressures by tightening 
credit as inflation appeared to abate this summer the central 
bank has eased its grip 
the latest survey was prepared at the feds kansas city bank 
based on information obtained before oct 10 
seven of the 12 districts mentioned prices they were 
generally stable in boston while moving up but at a 
slackening pace in philadelphia 
cleveland expects very little moderation in inflation 
through the end of the year while richmond reports a slower rise 
in input prices respondents in the atlanta district reported 
only modest wage or price pressures 
in the kansas city district retail prices and prices of 
manufacturers inputs have changed little in recent months while 
wage and price increases remain modest in the san francisco 
district 
in the retail area the srvey found that sales of apparel 
basic housewares and other nondurables are described as relatively 
strong sales are weaker for discretionary bigticket items such 
as furniture home appliances and consumer electronics auto sales 
have also been weakening recently 
manufacturing activity was described as slowing in the 
philadelphia chicago and cleveland districts varied in richmond

while chicago reported receiving mixed reports richmond reported 
stronger demand for mortgage loans

new york and san francisco 
the san francisco district reported that most businesses in its 
area have resumed operations since the earthquake but road 
closures and property damage are delaying a complete return to 
busienss as usual 
the richmond district said many of the usual south carolina 
participants in its survey did not respond because of hurricane 
hugo but it said the hurricane had little effect on the industrial 
base of either of the carolinas 
hugo however severely affected the agriculture sectors of 
north and south carolina bringing extensive damage to crops and 
structures as well as considerable destruction of livestock and 
poultry total damage to the farm sector in both states has been 
estimated at nearly 12 billion

consumers have more protection under existing 
food pesticide laws than they would under changes proposed last 
week by president bush a consumer lawyer told a senate panel 
were better off with current law if were going to have to 
sacrifice the basic health nature of the statute janet s 
hathaway of the natural resources defense council said wednesday at 
labor and human resources committee hearing 
she called the bush plan a cynical effort that 
fundamentally erodes the basic healthprotective standard in the 
food safety law by letting the government weigh the benefits of a 
hazardous pesticide when deciding whether to cancel or suspend it 
her organization was joined by public citizen and consumers 
union in criticizing the bush proposal to raise the acceptable 
cancer risk level to one in 100000 critics say a risk level of 
one in 1 million the standard used last year by the environmental 
protection agency should be applied 
although the proposals would result in swifter cancellation and 
more suspension of especially dangerous pesticides critics 
questioned whether the epa would have the political courage to 
enforce a law that allows a riskbenefit calculation 
further they said the plan fails to address aggregate risks 
the total risk when the entire diet of a person is considered 
not just a single pesticide in one food also safety legislation 
needs to consider the risk to special populations such as children 
and pregnant woment they said 
legislation by sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the 
committee would address those issues 
representatives of the agricultural chemical industry and farm 
groups criticized both the bush and kennedy proposals although 
they backed bushs riskbenefit formula 
they said the standard in the kennedy bill would amount to a 
zero risk because of its numerical formula of one in 1 million 
but they said the bush definition of an imminent hazard would 
be subject to inconsistent applications 
not only do pesticides help ensure the availability and 
affordability of agricultural products but they are often 
necessary to ensure the safety and nutritional value of many 
commodities said marlyn jorgensen president of the american 
soybean association 
the health benefits offered by pesticides to the american 
consumer cannot be overlooked he said

us savings bonds will earn interest at a 
rate of 698 percent over the next six months down from the 781 
percent rate prevailing over the last six months the treasury 
department said 
however the department had to suspend new sales indefinitely 
tuesday because of congressional failure to enact legislation 
raising the federal debt limit 
without new legislation to increase the debt limit the 
government lacks authority to issue any new debt obligations the 
treasury said in a statement wednesday 
the governments borrowing authority dropped at midnight tuesday 
from 287 trillion to 280 trillion 
the house has voted to raise the debt ceiling to 31 trillion 
for the current fiscal year but senate legislation has been 
blocked by a squabble over whether to cut the capital gains tax 
when savings bonds go back on sale those issued during the 
remainder of november will earn interest from the first of the 
month the department said payroll savings plans will continue to 
operate normally except that bonds that would have been issued 
during the current suspension will be issued when the suspension is 
lifted 
the new savings bond rate reflects market activity during the 
past six months and keeps savings bonds in the mainstream of 
financial products for the coming semiannual rate period said 
jerrold b speers executive director of the savings bond division 
savings bonds interest rates are changed each may 1 and nov 1 
to reflect open market rates they are based on 85 percent of the 
yield on fiveyear treasury securities which have averaged 821 
percent over the last six months 
savings bond yields at redemption are the average of semiannual 
marketbased rates during the time held compounded semiannually 
or a minimum rate whichever is greater the current minimum rate 
is 6 percent 
since market rates for bonds were introduced the rates have 
ranged from a high of 1094 percent for the six months beginning in 
november 1984 to a low of 584 percent for the six months beginning 
in may 1987 
in addition to savings bonds the department suspended the sale 
of special securities for state and local governments the 
temporary investment vehicles for money those governments raise in 
the bond market 
if the securities are not available state and local governments 
could be forced to cancel planned bond sales leading to disruption 
of the municipal bond market

skinner also said wednesday his department will extend to light

fourwheeldrive utility vehicles the existing roof 
crushresistance standards for passenger cars 
the new requirements will be made final after a 60day public 
comment period 
light trucks are being used more and more to transport people 
instead of property skinner said in a statement these new 
rules will help ensure that occupants are adequately protected 
particularly in rollovers 
spokesmen for the big three auto manufactuters said they already 
were meeting one or both of the proposed standards or would by the 
1992 model year when the rules are to take effect they would 
apply to cars made after sept 1 1991 
the departments national highway traffic safety administration 
acknowledged in a statement that most light truck manufacturers are 
voluntarily meeting the level of roof crush resistance required for 
passenger cars but the agency said extending the standard would 
ensure total compliance by current and future manufacturers 
under the proposed roof crush rule roofs would have to 
withstand a force of 1 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle 
during a test a vehicles roof could not be depressed more than 
five inches 
the rule would apply to multipurpose passenger vehicles and 
trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10000 pounds or less

the japanese government has urged caution by 
companies considering purchases of us corporations and 
properties but the suggestion appears to be having little 
influence 
mitsubishi estates purchase of a majority stake in rockefeller 
group inc owner of new yorks famed rockefeller center on the 
heels of sony corps 34 billion buyout of columbia pictures 
entertainment inc has heightened concern in the united states over 
japanese control of us assets 
japanese companies and government officials are acutely aware of 
the controversy and public relations officers are working overtime 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe expressed concern this 
week about a possible american backlash and suggested that 
businesses weighing us investments could come up and ask our 
opinion 
but analysts say government influence over such decisions is 
waning 
clearly there is no grand national coordination it would be 
in the japanese national interest if everyone cooled it for a 
while but who wants to be the first to hold back says japanese 
business expert james abegglen 
as individual firms charge ahead business associations are 
working to reduce investment friction 
the council for better corporate citizenship led by sony 
chairman akio morita disseminates information on how to 
participate in community activities and avoid racism and sexism to 
smooth relations in overseas subsidiaries 
industry analysts say some major real estate firms are avoiding 
buying landmark us buildings because of the attention they 
attract companies in many industries are increasingly sensitive to 
public relations japanese executives of american subsidiaries of 
mitsui real estate development co one of the most aggressive 
japanese developers in the united states are active in raising 
money for the united way 
tokyo analysts were surprised that a conservative company like 
mitsubishi would risk possible negative reaction to a highprofile 
deal involving rockefeller center especially so soon after the 
sonycolumbia deal 
but some suggested the company may believe its conservative 
image and prestigious name would reassure critics that it had 
rockefeller centers best interests at heart 
it was the rockefeller group that was eager to conclude the deal 
and wanted mitsubishi to take a majority stake even though the 
japanese firm wanted to proceed at a slower pace said mitsubishi 
spokesman james rudy 
the rockefeller group also approached mitsui real estate nippon 
life insurance co and several other firms about investing before 
mitsubishi concluded the deal said spokesmen for the japanese 
firms although the companies declined to comment on their reasons 
for not pursuing the deal several major newspapers reported they 
were concerned about possible backlash 
the japanese press gives heavy coverage to american reaction to 
japanese business activities 
immediately after the announcement of the mitsubishi deal 
japanese camera crews were on the streets of new york interviewing 
americans for their reaction japanese news organizations phoned 
american correspondents in tokyo to ask what nuance they were 
giving their stories 
when the sonycolumbia deal was featured on the cover of 
newsweek it was picked up by local media and prompted criticism of 
american overreaction 
we cannot help feeling that some american reactions are 
overly emotional commented the national newspaper asahi shimbun 
outspoken lawmaker shintaro ishihara blames american racism in 
part 
foreign ministry spokesman watanabe noted after the mitsubishi 
deal that similar purchases by british and dutch investors did not 
raise the same unease among americans 
but at the same time they criticize american reactions many 
japanese businessmen and government officials are acutely aware of 
and even sympathetic to american sentiments about japanese 
investment 
it is important that japanese corporations act in 
consideration of these feelings the asahi shimbun said after the 
sonycolumbia deal 
the paper said one reason for american resentment is that 
while japanese firms can take over us firms easily the reverse 
is not true it suggested the situation should be changed 
some japanese are surprised there is not stronger reaction 
against foreign buyouts the reaction to mitsubishis purchase 
among new yorkers appeared to be largely positive mayor edward 
koch welcomed the deal 
japanese national television broadcast comments from new yorkers 
on the street saying its a good thing we need the 
investment its a free country and its your money you 
can do what you want with it 
on hearing these comments one japanese newscaster shook his 
head in disbelief 
would we say the same thing if a korean or a hong kong 
conglomerate came and bought up a piece of marunouchi the prime 
business district in tokyo owned by mitsubishi he asked

the us economy continued to slow in the third quarter as the 
manufacturing sector weakened for the sixth straight month 
according to new reports from the nations purchasing managers and 
the commerce department 
analysts said the data provides further evidence that the 
economys growth has softened since an unexpectedly brisk summer 
and could remain sluggish in the months ahead 
the purchasing managers index a widely watched economic 
barometer rose to 476 percent in october from 46 percent in 
september and 452 percent in august the group said wednesday 
a reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of 
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent 
indicates growth according to the association 
it was the sixth straight decline in manufacturing but the 
second consecutive month where the rate of decline was less than in 
the previous month said the national association of purchasing 
management 
a huge increase in defense orders helped boost us factory 
orders in september the government said in a separate report 
wednesday although without defense contracts such orders actually 
declined while construction spending remained flat during that 
month 
this confirms what is essentially a weak economy said 
lawrence a veit an economist with the investment firm brown 
brothers harriman amp co 
a survey by the federal reserve of the nations economic growth 
largely reinforced the other data results of the sixweek survey 
concluded that the economy is growing at a slow to moderate pace 
with manufacturing and construction weak in some sections of the 
country consumer spending mixed and resource industries including 
energy and agriculture improving 
the monthly purchasing managers report is based on a survey of 
purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies the 
index is a composite of responses regarding six separate 
indicators including new orders production vendor deliveries 
inventories prices and employment 
the commerce department meanwhile said orders for durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2367 
billion excluding the jump in defense orders orders actually 
declined 21 percent 
in a separate report the department said construction spending 
was unchanged in september after surging by 15 percent in august 
residential nonresidential and government construction spending 
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4156 billion in 
september 
spending spurted in august because of a strong 53 percent 
increase in government building and a 29 percent gain in 
nonresidential construction 
contributing to the decline in the october purchasing managers 
survey was a steep drop in the export orders growth rate while 
export orders remained relatively brisk last month the index fell 
to 555 percent from 605 percent 
if you keep shortterm interest rates high eventually they 
will affect exports said thomas f carpenter an economist with

the manufacturing and housing sectors of the economy have been 
hit hardest by high interest rates as the federal reserve tightened 
credit in an effort to slow inflation 
however the survey also indicated a sharp turnaround in new 
orders growth after a fourmonth decline robert j bretz chairman 
of the associations business survey committee said the reversal 
hints of a possible continued easing in the overall future rate 
of decline in the manufacturing economy 
new orders is one of six variables considered in the purchasing 
managers survey the new orders index rose to 514 percent from 
454 percent in september 
nevertheless while us manufacturing is sluggish some 
economists said the purchasing managers survey has overstated the 
weakness 
all this says is that the manufacturing sector is weaker than 
the economy as a whole said giulio martini an economist with 
sanford c bernstein amp co inc 
fundamentally the manufacturing sector is strong carpenter 
said you just need a drop in interest rates of about a half 
percentage point and we wiil start to see a release of the pentup 
demand pressures that have been building 
indexes for vendor deliveries production prices and employment 
all declined according to the survey 
the seasonally adjusted indexes for the six separate indicators 
represent the net change between those reporting positive negative 
and similar responses from the previous month

for restaurant owner jesus tavera a 
higher minumum wage means a higherpriced menu 
for shirlee lora a single mother of two getting more than 
335 an hour means means more food and clothes for her children 
for grocery store owner bill engelbrecht a higher minimum wage 
wouldnt mean much because he cant get anyone to work for the 
current minimum anyway 
those were some of the impressions wednesday in the nations 
heartland after the us house voted 38237 for an increase in the 
minimum wage from 335 per hour to 425 per hour 
under the bill the minimum would go to 380 per hour april 1 
and to 425 per hour one year later the measure now goes to the 
senate where leaders said they hoped to put it on president bushs 
desk before thanksgiving 
if i have to pay more i have to raise my prices said 
tavera who opened restaurante guadalajara three months ago in 
kansas citys west side 
tavera said he thought it wasnt a bad idea to raise the 
minimum but it would cause acrosstheboard inflation 
if i have somebody who cooks for 450 an hour and the minimum 
becomes 425 shes going to ask me for 550 tavera said 
ms lora 26 made 335 per hour when she started at a midtown 
winchells donut house she now makes 425 the proposed new 
minimum and she says theres a big difference 
theres more to buy for my two kids you can basically 
save more theres no way you can save on the current minimum 
she said adding that an increase is long overdue 
if approved the minimumwage hike would be the first since 1981 
but many employers said the market had already rendered the 
335perhour rate obsolete 
engelbrecht manager of a large grocery store next to truman 
high school in independence said he couldnt hire help for 335 
im next door to a high school i mean right next door and i 
cant get help they walk on by he said 
he said grocery baggers start at 390 per hour now and by the 
time the new minimums would phase in the sackers likely will be 
making more 
it makes the politicians look good but they havent done 
anybody any favors engelbrecht said the private sector is 
ahead of the government 
richard diehl who manages a burger king near downtown said he 
also couldnt pay minimum wage although many will work for a few 
cents more an hour 
even in the most depressed areas it affects their mentalities 
to take the minimum wage diehl said they wont take a 
minimumwage job 
he said the 425 minimum would cost his restaurant roughly 
8000 more a year 
that wouldnt devastate us he said adding that many 
employers already were planning on a federally mandated increase 
other fastfood managers said only the youngest least 
experienced start at the current minimum in johnson county kan 
an affluent suburb west of kansas city many youngsters start at 
more than 4 per hour now managers said 
manuel rayes publisher of the bilingual dos mundos newspaper 
said the measure would help hispanic citizens perhaps at the 
expense of undocumented workers 
these people are going to come out of their homes and look for 
jobs and maybe theyll take jobs that the illegals would have 
had rayes said 
the illegal ones will come here and work for anything they 
can rayes added its not that theyre taking jobs away they 
are taking jobs that nobody wants

senate leaders are promising to pass the first 
raise in the minimum wage in nearly a decade before thanksgiving 
following a lopsided house vote for the compromise increase 
the house voted 38237 on wednesday to raise the minimum wage 
from 335 its level since january 1981 to 380 next april 1 
and 425 a year later 
a vote in the senate where the measure has overwhelming 
support has not been scheduled but could come as early as next 
week senate passage would send the measure to president bush 
whose compromise with congress tuesday ends an eightyear political 
fight between congressional democrats and two republican 
administrations 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine called the 
compromise a victory for working americans those at the bottom 
of the economic scale who need a boost and need it as soon as 
possible 
house democrats who had failed in years past to raise the 
minimum wage said their victory was tempered by an increase smaller 
than they had passed earlier this year and by the new subminimum 
wage for teenagers new to the job market 
this vote represents only a partial victory for lowwage 
workers rep augustus hawkins dcalif said after the house 
endorsed the compromise however something is better than 
nothing we should never again allow a decade to elapse with no 
action 
the lower minimum could be paid to workers from 16 to 19 years 
old for their first three months of work experience it could be 
extended for three more months for youths in certified training 
programs 
the lower wage would be 85 percent of the prevailing minimum 
wage except for in the first year of the increase when it would be 
barred from being below the current 335 an hour minimum the 
subminimum would be 361 when the minimum wage rose to 425 
the provision allowing the lower wage expires in april 1993 
the government says some 4 million americans work at the minimum 
wage congressional researchers say twothirds of them are women 
and between 25 percent and 33 percent are heads of households 
eleven states have laws mandating minimum wages higher than the 
current federal floor a few of them already are at the 425 level 
despite the lopsided vote lawmakers from both parties found 
fault with the compromise 
democrats complained the increase was too small and the 
subminimum created a dangerous twotiered wage system some 
conservative republicans opposed any increase and said congress was 
intruding on business costs 
but the fierce partisanship that characterized the fight over a 
bill bush vetoed last summer was absent 
we could have let politics override our effort to reach an 
agreement on minimum wage said rep thomas ridge rpa who had 
urged the white house to drop its refusal to compromise that 
political debate is behind us 
voting for the compromise were 247 democrats and 135 
republicans two democrats who support a higher minimum wage carl 
perkins of kentucky and george miller of california voted no 
because they oppose the subminimum thirtyfive republicans voted 
against the measure 
to strike the deal democrats agreed to push back the effective 
dates of the increases from january to april accept the subminimum 
wage and drop their insistence on a commission to make annual 
recommendations on the wage level a mechanism republicans said 
would have been used to seek annual increases 
bush in what the administration insisted until friday was his 
first best and final offer earlier this year offered an 
increase to 425 and a sixmonth lower minimum for new workers 
regardless of previous experience he agreed to the increase nine 
months earlier than he had proposed and accepted a far more 
restrictive subminimum wage

the los angeles herald examiner once the 
nations largest afternoon newspaper published its last edition 
today announcing its bittersweet farewell with the headline so 
long la 
virtually every columnist and many of the 86yearold 
newspapers reporters confessed in print to giving way to tears 
while composing the edition 
they tore a part of my heart out yesterday sports columnist 
doug krikorian declared on a sports page whose headline asserted 
were outta here 
humor columnist gordon dillow found himself without a joke 
tough hardbitten journalists arent supposed to cry he 
lamented and yet when the announcement came that this would 
be the last edition of this newspaper dozens of tough hardbitten 
reporters and editors who have spent years dealing with death and 
destruction and calamity on a daily basis stood around with tears 
welling up in their eyes 
hearst corp attributed the closing to losses of up to 2 
million a month and a lack of suitable buyers since the paper was 
offered for sale last summer 
the announcement of the closing which leaves the nations 
secondlargest city with just one daily paper came wednesday from 
robert danzig general manager of hearst newspapers who spoke from 
atop the newsrooms copy desk 
although operating at a financial deficit for more than two 
decades there was never a deficit in the quality and the vigor of 
its editorial commitment to the people of los angeles he said 
it has been a losing business but a winning newspaper 
the papers 831 employees will receive 60 days severance pay 
and help in looking for work longtime staffers will get 
additional unspecified benefits 
founded by william randolph hearst in 1903 as the los angeles 
examiner the newspaper was under intense pressure in recent years 
from the los angeles times the regions dominant daily with five 
times the heralds daily circulation 
its a sad day for journalism and a sad day for los angeles 
said shelby coffey iii editor of the times 
the cessation of publication shook many herald staffers even 
though they already were inured by repeated speculation about the 
papers demise 
of course its a tragedy said freelance writer rip rense a 
herald examiner reporter from 1979 to 1983 for all the ups and 
downs and the flaws of the herald in the last 10 years it was still 
always a very lively read with occasional excellent journalism 
consistently in the sports section 
herald editorial staffers found themselves inundated by 
inquiries by other newspapers the suburban orange county register 
set up an adhoc recruiting table at corkys a favorite drinking 
spot across the street from the heralds landmark spanishstyle 
building 
we dont want to be ghoulish about it but there are lots of 
good people who work here said john hollon a register assistant 
managing editor 
but even as writers press operators and drivers contemplated 
their future the staff attempted to fulfill editor maxwell 
mccrohons exhortation that everyone put out a hell of a last 
edition 
this paper has been more than a job its been a cause for a 
lot of people to keep a viable number 2 in los angeles andy 
furillo a sevenyear employee said after finishing the main news 
story on his employers passing 
although it lacked the salaries staff and resources of its main 
competitor the herald earned respect for its coverage of city 
hall sports and entertainment 
the heralds circulation peaked in 1967 at 729000 for the six 
months that ended march 31 its average daily circulation was 
238392 and 183122 sunday 
that compared with the times 1119840 daily and 1423310 
sunday according to the audit bureau of circulations 
mccrohon also attributed the papers circulation fall to a long 
bitter strike on dec 15 1967 members of the los angeles 
newspaper guild launched the sometimes violent 10year strike 
which was never technically settled 
the herald switched to morning publication in 1981 besides the 
times the paper had to wrestle with increasingly successful 
suburban papers like the register based in santa ana and the los 
angeles daily news based in the san fernando valley 
by the time it converted to mornings the game was over 
said john morton a newspaper analyst at the washington dc 
brokerage firm lynch jones amp ryan 
the herald examiner is a classic example of a newspaper that 
suffered for many years by being in the afternoon position 
twentythree newspapers in major us cities have closed since 
1950 morton said 
other major daily newspapers that closed during the 1980s 
included the miami news the baltimore news american the memphis 
tenn pressscimitar the cleveland press and the washington star

just days after fujitsu ltd failed in its attempt 
to escape a contract for which it bid 1 yen or about 07 of a us 
cent the japanese computer giant said it was trying to withdraw 
from another 1yen deal it says lacks common sense 
akira imagawa a spokesman at fujitsus headquarters in tokyo 
said wednesday that company officials in the nagano prefecture in 
central japan had asked local authorities to cancel a contract the 
company won last month with a 1yen bid 
both cases have attracted the attention of japans fair trade 
commission whose officials say they are considering an 
investigation into whether the unusually low bids constitute unfair 
trade under the antimonopoly law 
in the nagano deal fujitu and electronics giant nec corp made 
identical 1yen bids for a contract to design software for the 
prefectural libarys computer system local officials said 
the prefectural government had set aside 16 million yen or 
about 112000 in its budget for the project the officials said 
on condition of anonymity 
frontline salesmen desperately wanted to win the contract 
but lacked common sense imagawa said 
in the earlier case fujitsu officials said their 1yen bid to 
design software to map the hiroshima city water supply system 
represented a longterm investment but later they appeared to 
change their minds and asked the city to cancel the contract the 
city had budgeted 78000 for the project 
city officials refused although they said their decision would 
depend on the outcome of a possible fair trade commission 
investigation 
we will continue to seek the citys understanding to retract 
the contract fujitsus imagawa said 
meanwhile officials of the ministry of international trade and 
industry cautioned fujitsu on tuesday about business practices that 
were beyond common sense said an official of the ministrys 
electronics policy division 
the official who spoke anonymously said the ministry also 
urged major member companies in the japan electronics industry 
development associaton a industrial grouping of computer and 
electronics makers not to make discount sales at irrational 
prices 
companies competing for both the hiroshima and the nagano 
contracts reportedly saw the projects as a way to get a head start 
on computer systems expected to be linked up throughout the country 
but makoto sakata a noted commentator said the cases also 
demonstrated that corporate ethics lag behind generally accepted 
rules of behavior with companies emphasizing their relations with 
local officials rather than profitability 
looking at what japans leading hightechnology companies like 
fujitsu and nec are doing its painfully clear that modernaization 
of japanese corporations is superficial and that they in fact 
remain unchanged from the feudal age sakata said

the national securities commission thursday 
recommended the spanish unit of drexel burnham lambert inc be 
fined the maximum amount for fraudulent trading practices 
the watchdog agency recommended the economy ministry fine dbl 
capital markets espana sa 65 million pesetas or 556725 or 
five times the amount of the operations gross profits which is 
the maximum fine under law 
the spanish branch of the us securities firm was liquidated in 
june 
the commission said its investigation sufficiently proved 
the trading company had committed a very serious infraction 
during the partial privatization of shares of the statecontroled 
repsol oil group last may 
the spanish investigation made public last june was an 
embarrassment to drexel which earlier this year had pleaded guilty 
to six us felonies brought under a us insider trading probe and 
agreed to pay more than 650 million to settle criminal securities 
charges 
the commission also said it had turned over evidence to a local 
court to determine whether the infraction also constituted criminal 
fraud 
drexels spanish unit allegedly created false clients through 
unauthorized use of names of spaniards in order to secure the 
maximum number of shares allowed to brokers for resale instead 
drexel sold the shares to just 17 foreign institutional investors 
the investigation showed 
last july drexels chief executive officer said the firm had 
ordered its 27employee spanish unit closed down after the 
announcement of the investigation which the firm described as 
improper behavior 
under spanish law the spanish units parent company is legally 
responsible for the fine since the unit has been liquidated

american workers made significant productivity 
gains in the third quarter the government said today in a report 
that nonetheless underscored the economys slower growth and 
manufacturings slump 
overall productivity in the nonfarm sector of the economy rose 
at an annual rate of 21 percent in the third quarter nearly 
double the revised secondquarter gain of 11 percent the labor 
department said 
that overall gain bodes well for the economy at a time of tight 
labor markets and a reluctance of some employers to hire new 
workers because of concern about future economic growth improved 
productivity is an important means of keeping us businesses 
competitive and offsetting possible inflationary pressures caused 
by wage gains 
but the report also provided fresh evidence that the 
manufacturing sector is struggling and faces continued pressures 
that hurt its ability to compete abroad 
the overall improvement came as output rose at an annual 
seasonally adjusted rate of 31 percent while hours worked climbed 
just 1 percent 
that thirdquarter increase in hours was the lowest in more than 
three years further evidence that the growth rate of the economy 
has slowed 
the slowdown was even more evident in manufacturing where 
productivity rose at an annual rate of just 14 percent down 
sharply from the revised secondquarter improvement of 37 percent 
the thirdquarter gain in manufacturing was the smallest since 
the fourth quarter of 1987 output in manufacturing increased just 
13 percent at an annual rate in the last three months the 
smallest gain since 1986 and hours worked in the sector declined 
01 percent at an annual rate after falling a revised 02 percent 
in the second quarter 
the data show that wage gains by workers were smaller in the 
third quarter than in the second but that workers actually got more 
buying power out of their paychecks in the julyseptember period 
because the wage gains outpaced consumer inflation after trailing 
the price increases in the prior three months 
overall hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 53 
percent in the nonfarm sector down from the second quarter 
annualrate gain of 56 percent but when inflation is factored in 
the compensation rose at an annual rate of 29 percent in the third 
quarter the largest gain in two years after falling 07 percent 
in the apriljune period 
because of the 21 percent productivity gain unit labor costs 
increased at an annual rate of 32 percent in the third quarter 
despite the significant compensation increase unit labor costs had 
increased at a revised 45 percent in the second quarter 
but in manufacturing the slump and rising wages caused a 
significant increase in unit labor costs 
the labor department said those costs rose at a rapid 45 
percent annual rate in the third quarter after falling at a revised 
annual rate of 10 percent in the second quarter that was the 
largest quarterly increase in unit labor costs in the manufacturing 
sector since a 97 percent annual gain was reported in the first 
quarter of 1982 during the last recession 
continued higher costs to produce goods in manufacturing would 
only add to the sectors slump if us manufacturers are forced to 
raise prices it would make it even more difficult for them to 
compete in foreign markets 
another gauge of productivity that includes agriculture showed 
that productivity improved at an annual rate of 12 percent in the 
third quarter with output up at an annual rate of 30 percent and 
hours worked up 17 percent that gain was down from the revised 
16 percent annualrate gain in that sector in the second quarter

the securities industry needs to work harder to 
safeguard the marketplace and address program trading and index 
arbitrage strategies accusedc of causing wide swings in the stock 
market the newly nominated chairman of the securities industry 
association said today 
our organization needs to sit down and do something about it 
we need to look at the pros and cons said robert n downey 
partner with goldman sachs amp co and a former member of the 
municipal securities rulemaking board 
downey 53 was named to succeed hardwick simmons as 1990 
chairman of the trade group which represents more than 625 
securities brokerages and investment banking firms in the united 
states and canada 
the sia board will vote on the nomination at its annual meeting 
on nov 29 in florida 
in recent days several major wall street brokerages have said 
they will curb program trading that critics claim is dangerously 
distorting the stock market and scaring away small investors 
in program trading millions of shares of stocks are traded 
almost instantaneously by computerized systems used mainly by huge 
institutional investors such as banks mutual funds and pension 
funds 
our policy has to be to address controversial strategies 
downey said 
however he said many of the problems facing the industry have 
been overstated 
weve had these outside factors and we have insider trading 
scandals and things of that nature that maybe involve just a few 
people but they are magnified and thought to be pervasive but 
theyre not downey said 
also nominated to the sia board were john l steffens president 
and chief executive of of merrill lynch pierce fenner amp smith 
inc as vice chairman richard b fisher president of morgan 
stanley group inc and addison l piper chairman fo chief 
executive of piper jaffray amp hopwood both renominated as vice 
chairmen 
simmons vice chairman of shearson lehman hutton inc will 
continue to serve as an officer and director of sia

the commissioner of the food and drug 
administration criticized a new american heart association seal 
of approval program as regulation for profit 
frank e young commenting wednesday before an fda public 
hearing on food labeling joined the us agriculture department in 
disapproving of the idea 
the association proposes to issue the seal to companies 
beginning in february for a fee of up to 40000 per product if 
they meet lowsodium lowcholesterol guidelines 
were deeply concerned about a forprofit regulatory 
approach young said 
he said that the determination of what can be put on food labels 
is a government responsibility and that the plan might lead to 
competing and misleading information 
however heart association spokeswoman debra garner said the 
program is not for profit 
the fees ranging from 10000 to 40000 would cover the cost 
of advertising the program distributing brochures in supermarkets 
and product testing she said the fee would depend on the size of 
the company and its market share 
the usda sent the association a letter critical of the program 
as it pertains to meat or poultry which the agriculture department 
oversees the fda has jurisdiction over other food products 
the usda said the labeling would lead consumers to believe that 
foods that dont have the associations seal would be less 
desirable 
ms garner said the plan doesnt need government approval 
the heart association says the program aims to educate consumers 
and help them eat healthier

compaq computer corps stock plunged nearly 15 
percent today after the company announced fourthquarter earnings 
will be below expectations 
shortly before 11 am est compaq was off 1537 at 9062 in 
heavy new york stock exchange trading in the last year the stock 
traded as high as 11250 a share and dipped as low as 52 
october sales came in about 10 percent below our expectations 
leading us to believe that the results of our fourth quarter would 
not meet analysts expectations compact chief executive rod 
canion said today sales for the full fourth quarter however 
are still expected to grow 1520 percent over the previous year 
and as a result of the normal tightly controlled financial 
environment in which the company is managed we believe our overall 
performance will be consistent with the companys longrange 
objective of 8to10 percent profit after tax 
a week ago compaq stock tumbled 8 percent after the computer 
maker disclosed it uncovered two minor flaws in the i486 
microprocessor made by intel corp the chip will be the brains of a 
major new computer compaq is introducing next week 
canion blamed lackluster sales on a slowing growth rate in the 
american market limited availability of new products and continued 
uncertainty about the new i486 chip 
intel which said the two flaws had been discovered by an 
unidentified customer said it would begin shipping a fixed version 
of the chip by the end of this month 
one flaw involves trigonometric functions and another involves a 
feature that detects irregular operations like attempting to 
divide by zero both occur only under special conditions and would 
not affect most users the company said 
compaq also reported last week its earnings jumped 51 percent in 
the third quarter but part of the increase came from a gain in the 
carrying value of its investment in a diskdrive maker conner 
peripherals inc the earnings were at the low end of analysts 
expectations

the countrys big retailers today reported mixed october sales 
with results at some general merchandise stores hurt by consumers 
reluctance to spend freely on expensive goods such as furniture or 
home appliances 
clothing retailers fared better than major national chains that 
depend heavily on sales of bigticket durable goods 
but in some parts of the country particularly the northeast 
unseasonably mild weather discouraged shopping for winter apparel 
they were generally modest kinds of sales gains that continued 
the basic trend of the past several months said analyst jeffrey 
feiner of merrill lynch amp co 
the department stores and some of the specialty retailers 
outperformed the durablegoods dependent retailers such as sears 
and k mart feiner said 
sears roebuck and co the largest us retailer said its 
sales edged up 07 percent in the four weeks ended oct 28 to 253 
billion from 251 billion a year earlier 
but sales at sears stores open at least a year called 
samestore or comparablestore sales were flat 
retailers and analysts regard samestore sales as a better 
reflection of a companys performance than tallies that include the 
take at newly opened stores 
feiner said results for some of the retailers looked slightly 
worse than they were because they were being compared with a strong 
month last year 
analysts said it was difficult to generalize about last months 
retailing business because the results varied so widely economists 
track retailers results closely for clues about spending patterns 
consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of total us 
economic output 
the numbers were really mixed more so than weve seen in 
previous months said retail analyst jeffrey edelman of drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
within the apparel category alone there were variations 
moderate to higherpriced clothing merchants posted fairly strong 
results while apparel sales at discounters lagged analysts said 
the figures reported today by major general merchandise chains 
and apparel retailers differ from the governments monthly retail 
sales figures the commerce department report is more comprehensive 
and covers sales at auto dealers supermarkets restaurants and 
elsewhere 
among some of retailers reporting were 
k mart corp the secondlargest retailer said its october 
sales increased 53 percent to 207 billion from 197 billion in 
october 1988 its comparablestore sales were up 21 percent 
thirdranked walmart stores inc reported a 22 percent 
increase in october sales to 219 billion from 179 billion 
walmarts samestores sales grew 8 percent 
jc penney co inc reported a 96 percent october sales gain 
to 128 billion from 117 billion penneys samestore sales rose 
82 percent 
dayton hudson corp reported october sales went up 162 percent 
to 969 million from 834 million its samestore sales rose 85 
percent 
limited inc a leading specialty apparel retailer said its 
sales rose 9 percent to 3349 million from 3077 million on a 
comparablestore basis limiteds sales were up 6 percent

brazil and argentina the ailing 
giants of south america are trying to salvage their crumbling 
economies by starting a common market modeled after europe and the 
united states 
the traditional rivals say cooperation is the only way for latin 
america to head off economic disaster 
there arent many options either we work out a joint strategy 
in line with our development needs or we will be the objects of 
outside strategies argentine president carlos menem told 
brazils congress during a threeday visit in august 
burdened by stagnant growth fourdigit inflation and a combined 
foreign debt of some 170 billion brazil and argentina have 
knocked down some trade barriers and recently agreed to boost trade 
and cooperation to unprecedented levels 
the idea is not new in the last three decades an array of 
organizations the latin american association of free commerce the 
andean pact the latin american development association and most 
recently the latin american economic system were devised to 
unite latin american economies 
all failed mostly because of excessive protectionism 
nationalism and cultural antagonism 
but this time around latin american leaders say they can lick 
the problem by starting small 
tiny uruguay which borders the two giants recently joined 
brazil and argentina in the common market scheme now these three 
countries hope to attract other nations to the fold or at least 
set an example for other regional trade blocs 
its the only way for latin america to create a common 
market said helio jaguaribe director of research at rio de 
janeiros institute of political and social research the 
brazilargentina accords have become a spotlight for other 
countries to follow 
the renewed interest in a latin common market was sparked by the 
growth of trade alliances in western europe between the united 
states and canada and between japan and its asian neighbors 
analysts say 
integration is fundamental fernando collor de mello 
brazils leading presidential candidate said recently latin 
america cannot be left out of this new world order 
increasingly the regions leaders are dismantling or selling 
off the powerful but often inefficient staterun enterprises and 
turning to free market principles 
the return of civilian regimes in much of latin america also has 
helped foster mutual trust and economic liberalism that was lacking 
under military rule when generals were more concerned with 
national security 
the old military governments hardly wanted to share their 
secrets or strengths with their neighbors said paulo rabello de 
castro a private economic consultant in rio and managing editor of 
the respected financial monthly conjutora economica he said that 
mutual suspicion no longer exists 
indeed menem and sarney recently signed agreements to swap 
military space and nuclear technology and increase cultural 
exchange programs 
the growth of latin american industry also will boost 
integration economists say 
nations such as venezuela chile brazil and argentina are no 
longer as dependent on foreign technology as they were 30 years 
ago today they can trade a wide variety of products and resources 
without foreign assistance 
the integration gears are meshing de castro said by 
early next century a common market scheme could be in place 
complete with a regional judiciary system 
but large hurdles remain 
the current economic woes of argentina and brazil have left 
those countries without the funds needed to support and finance a 
continentwide market said economist carlos alberto primo braga a 
visiting professor at the johns hopkins school of advanced 
international studies 
its hard to achieve integration when the regions economies 
are in recession said economist celso furtado a former 
brazilian planning minister the last thing fragile internal 
industries will want is competition from other countries 
many analysts say economic growth needed to foster a common 
market will only start when the continents 440 billion foreign 
debt becomes less of a burden 
argentina is virtually bankrupt and 45 billion behind in 
payments on its 60 billion foreign debt 
even brazil which boasts the worlds eighth biggest economy and 
the third largest trade surplus spends most of its export earnings 
to pay interest on its 110 billion foreign debt the third worlds 
largest 
to ease the burden latin leaders are considering proposals to 
swap foreign debt to create a latin american common market fund 
according to aloizio mercadante oliva professor of economics at 
sao paulos catholic university 
another obstacle is the lack of a strong local currency the 
value of brazils new cruzado drops daily and argentinas austral 
has plummeted more than 97 percent against the us dollar in the 
last five months 
wed have a tough time trading even shoe laces with our funny 
money said rabello de castro 
to cope with the funny money problem brazil and argentina 
have a 500 million reciprocal credit agreement under which they 
import and export each others products without the use of currency 
large trade imbalances between nations and a reluctance to loan 
cash and share technology continue to impede integration analysts 
say 
indeed since south americas two largest trading partners 
announced their common market plans in 1985 brazil has run up a 
500 million trade surplus with argentina 
but that too may be changing brazil in august agreed to accept 
up to 350 million worth of argentinefinanced projects for 
transportation hospital construction and hydroelectric equipment

cowles media co said thursday it will sell 
the rapid city sd journal and the great falls mont tribune 
and offer to purchase up to 250000 shares of its own stock 
david cox president and chief executive of cowles media said 
the moves would address strategic issues for the company 
the cost of acquiring additional midsize market newspapers has 
effectively precluded our growth in regional newspapers to 
complement those in great falls and rapid city he said 
in todays competitive environment owning only two such 
papers is not a viable strategic position so we concluded that 
selling them is our best option 
the company said it is offering to buy up to 250000 shares of 
its own stock or about 10 percent of the total shares outstanding 
at a price of 200 a share the offer which includes voting and 
nonvoting shares will be made to all cowles media shareholders 
through an offering memorandum being mailed thursday the offer 
will expire jan 5 1990 unless extended 
cox said the company had previously determined that the purchase 
of its own stock was a good investment 
as a private company the market for cowles media shares is 
limited and as a result liquidity is important for some 
shareholders this offer will give all shareholders the opportunity 
to sell some of their shares if they so desire 
about 60 percent of the voting stock of cowles media is held in 
a voting trust for the benefit of members of the cowles family the 
trustees of the voting trust have indicated they do not intend to 
tender any shares of the voting stock held in the trust 
the rapid city journal was purchased by cowles media in 1964 and 
the great falls tribune in 1965 the journal has a daily 
circulation of 34368 and sunday circulation of 36472 the tribune 
has a daily circulation of 34167 and 40968 on sunday 
other cowles media operating units include the star tribune of

a former ford motor co employee who allegedly 
received 25 million in kickbacks from suppliers to a ford plant 
in suburban cleveland entered a plea agreement thursday with 
federal prosecutors 
ludwig a schafer 61 of stow ohio is expected to plead 
guilty nov 14 to two counts of mail fraud before us district 
judge julian cook jr in detroit assistant us attorney stephen 
robinson said 
the agreement called for schafer to serve up to five years in 
prison on the first count followed by five years probation on the 
second count robinson said 
schafer also agreed to make a good faith effort to 
compensate ford for the 25 million in kickbacks he allegedly 
received between 1976 and march 1989 while employed as a senior 
materials handling engineer at the automakers walton hills 
stamping plant robinson said 
ludwig allegedly rigged bids from suppliers of racks and other 
items used in shipping and materials handling to ensure that 
contracts would be awarded to companies agreeing to pay him 
kickbacks 
the winning bid was sufficiently inflated to ensure that the 
supplier could pay the kickbacks and still make a profit 
robinson said in several instances schafer agreed with the 
owner or an employee of the supplier paying the kickbacks to share 
the kickbacks with the owner or employee personally 
the two mailfraud counts charged schafer with mailing two ford 
checks totaling 98367 to empire wood products inc of hudson 
ohio empire and other companies accused of paying the kickbacks 
remain under investigation robinson said 
under the plea agreement schafer agreed to transfer certain 
property to ford as part of restitution to the automaker that 
property included his stow residence a 46foot power boat an 
arizona townhouse five acres of land in clarion pa and 1000 
shares of ford stock

eastman kodak co said thursday its 
earnings declined 25 percent in the third quarter the third 
consecutive decline this year 
kodak chairman and chief executive colby h chandler blamed the 
continued slide on higher operating costs and no improvement in 
productivity despite record sales for the quarter 
everything had very sluggish qualities to it although 
individual businesses performed well said financial analyst mark 
obenzinger of trinity trading co in new york 
in another adverse development for kodak the international 
union of electrical workers has said it is planning a drive at 
kodak which has long staved off organization attempts by offering 
workers generous bonuses and benefits 
iue organizers have been working on kodak for the past four to 
six weeks and have distributed thousands of leaflets at the plant 
in the past week said union organizer edward e young 
the company announced earnings of 329 million or 102 per 
share for the quarter ended oct 1 compared to 435 million or 
135 per share in the same quarter last year the company 
reported record sales of 511 billion for the third quarter up 2 
percent from last years record 503 billion 
earnings fell 23 percent in the first quarter and then 85 
percent in the second quarter when they were depressed by the 
expenses of a streamlining program analysts said it is too early 
for the effects of the restructuring to show up in the companys 
earnings

cray research inc has formalized its split 
with seymour cray the companys founder who is designing the 
supercomputers once considered its key hope for the early 1990s 
having already pumped 106 million into his cray3 cray 
research said wednesday its 986 million contribution to spinoff 
firm cray computer corp hinges on seymour crays continued 
affiliation with the new supercomputer company 
gary smaby an analyst who follows cray research for the 
minneapolisbased smaby group said the most revealing 
disclosure is that the deal is off if seymour leaves the firm or 
dies 
cray 64 is to be chairman and a computer developer for cray 
computer a 241employee firm based in colorado springs the 
spinoff is to occur nov 15 through a distribution of stock to 
existing stockholders of minneapolisbased cray research 
like cray research cray computer will develop highspeed 
scientific computers known as supercomputers its machines will 
sell for 15 million to 30 million each 
the disclosure of seymour crays financial importance to cray 
computer was one of several key points cray research revealed 
wednesday in an information statement on the new company 
in addition to hinging on seymour crays presence the 986 
million financial gift from cray research depends on no individual 
acquiring more than 20 percent ownership in the new firm cray 
computer continuing to pursue the cray3 project and the avoidance 
of bankruptcy by the new firm 
the split places the hopes for the 1990s of minneapolisbased 
cray research squarely on the c90 supercomputer design under way

share prices closed modestly lower thursday after 
londons confidence was shaken by unconfirmed rumors of an 
insidertrading scandal touching the government and by continued 
declines on wall street 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index lost 60 
points or 027 percent to close at 21541 roughly midway 
between its session low of 21463 and high of 21603 the key 
index moved around its closing level for much of the afternoon 
although it hit the days highs on a brief flurry of technical 
buying in early afternoon trading 
volume was 3484 million shares down from 3799 million on 
wednesday 
the widely circulated insidertrading rumor was tied to a report 
in a scottish newspaper that a british television network was about 
to name at least one senior government official in a report on 
insider dealing the rumor prompted speculation of further 
upheavals within the government and sent london shares lower at the 
outset 
the specific focus was on transport minister cecil parkinson 
who strongly denied the rumors 
the denial helped ease the markets worries but dealers said 
more wind was taken out of londons sails by a subsequent 
announcement that ford motor co reached an agreed bid of 850 pence 
a share or 16 billion pounds for british automaker jaguar plc 
the news along with a statement from general motors corp 
ended most of the speculation over a bidding war for the luxury 
automaker 
wall streets early declines kept london under pressure for much 
of the afternoon dealers said 
the insidertrading rumors really kept the market at bay a 
senior dealer with kleinwort benson securities said it set the 
tone but mostly people were just not too keen to rush and buy it 
and they werent too keen to sell it either 
the big stock feature of the day however was jaguar at 30 
million shares traded 
the ft 30share index settled 68 points lower at 17313 the 
ft 500share index was down 372 at 119509

increases in the prices farmers get for their 
crops and livestock have not kept up with the cost of producing 
them agriculture department figures show 
since 1977 prices paid by farmers for things they need to 
produce crops and livestock have risen 78 percent prices received 
by farmers for those crops and livestock meanwhile have gone up 
44 percent 
it doesnt take much expertise in economics to assert that 
something is out of whack and that the marketplace has 
shortchanged farmers by not keeping pace with rising expenses 
that is one reason congress has provided subsidies for farmers to 
help make up the difference 
last weeks agricultural prices report by the departments 
national agricultural statistics service included some comparative 
figures to show how the expenses of farming have changed in the 
last year 
prices are not the same as expenditures and do not necessarily 
translate into a financial balance sheet for the nations farmers 
for example not every farmer will buy a tractor this year 
which costs more than it did last year same for hay balers 
shovels fencing and other equipment used on the farm 
moreover all farmers do not buy the same things a vegetable 
farmer in california might be upset by a price increase for cartons 
used for produce but an iowa hog producer would be more interested 
in feed prices 
but if prices of several items keep going up over a long period 
of time it has an impact energy costs for example are almost 
universally important regardless of a farms location or 
specialty so are interest rates 
and if prices paid for crops and livestock remain the same or 
decline there will be trouble at the bank when the loan comes due 
not all purchase items are surveyed by usda every month but the 
report for october included several categories that are looked at 
once or twice a year 
the overall price index of prices paid for commodities and 
services interest taxes and farm wage rates was reported at 178 
in october compared to a rating of 100 for 1977 which is used by 
the usda as the base year for comparisons 
the index just for items used by farmers for production stood at 
164 in october these include prices for feeder livestock feed 
gasoline building and fencing materials machinery fertilizer 
trucks and other products 
one of the quirks in the price index is that some basic items 
are an expense for farmers who buy them and income for others who 
produce and sell the commodity corn and other feed grains are 
examples along with feeder cattle and feeder pigs 
feed prices in october had an index reading of 128 the report 
said that was a 38 percent drop from july and was 92 percent 
below october 1988 prices of feeder livestock were down 16 
percent from july but were unchanged from a year ago 
the feeder livestock price index was 196 in october nearly 
double what it was in the 1977 base year 
the index for fertilizer was 131 in october down 71 percent 
from the previous reading taken in april and 22 percent below a 
year ago 
in the category of fuels and energy the index stood at 184 in 
october down 21 percent from july but 115 percent above october 
1988 
for bigticket items the index tracking tractors and 
selfpropelled machinery rose 36 percent from last april to 199 in 
october about double the 1977 price average it was also a 59 
percent increase from a year earlier 
a big fourwheeldrive tractor in the 170to 240horsepower 
range cost an average of 79500 in october according to the 
survey down 200 from april but up 2700 from last year 
twowheeldrive tractors in the range of 110 to 129 horsepower 
were reported at 44600 last month up from 43200 in april and 
41200 a year ago 
a large capacity selfpropelled combine with grain head was 
shown at 99800 against 91600 in october 1988 
there are plenty of smaller lessglamorous items that are 
necessary in farming and many of these have to be replaced or 
added to from time to time here are a few of those price 
comparisons 
rough boards for farm fences and construction 523 per 1000 
board feet in october up from 521 in july and 511 a year ago 
house paint exterior latex 1660 per gallon compared with 
1650 in july and 1610 a year ago 
baler twine 2210 per 40pound bale up from 2180 in april 
and 2120 a year ago 
electric drill threeeighths inch variable speed reversible 
4830 in october and 4660 a year earlier 
pail 12quart metal heavy galvanized 605 compared with 
578 both in april and a year ago 
rear tractor tire 18438 sixply 437 in october 428 in 
april and 425 a year ago

futures prices of grain and soybeans posted 
moderate gains thursday on the chicago board of trade supported by 
market rumors of pending export sales of us grain to the soviet 
union and china 
it was mostly a russian day said trader victor lespinasse 
of dean witter reynolds inc referring to talk that the soviets 
were seeking to buy 4 million metric tons of us corn and 200000 
to 500000 metric tons of us soybean meal 
the soviet union also was rumored to be shopping for wheat and 
analysts said the agriculture department was expected to announce 
it is targeting china for sales of 1 million metric tons of us 
wheat at subsidized prices 
the soybean market also benefitted from a survey showing 
brazilian soybean planting running well behind the normal pace 
brazil is the worlds secondlargest soybean producer after the 
united states analysts said economic troubles are forcing south 
american farmers to reduce their plantings of both soybeans and 
corn 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for december delivery at 402 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 3 cents higher with december at 240 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 145 a bushel 
soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents higher with november at 566 a 
bushel

investor saul steinberg is unlikely to lead a 
takeover bid for ual corp but he could play a big supporting role 
in the next act of the ual buyout saga industry analysts said 
thursday 
steinberg who is said to be a close friend of ual chairman 
stephen wolf took center stage wednesday when his reliance group 
holdings inc filed for federal antitrust clearance to buy more 
than 15 percent but less than 25 percent of uals stock 
such a request often signals that the petitioner seeks an active 
role in the target company and usually a measure of control but 
because of his association with wolf analysts said steinberg 
probably was positioning himself to help uals chairman attempt 
another buyout or a corporate restructuring 
chicagobased ual is the parent of united airlines the nations 
secondlargest carrier and one of its most profitable 
ual stock surged in early trading on the new york stock exchange 
but the rally faded to a gain of only 75 cents a share by midday 
with the stock trading at 17775 
the stock had traded as high as 294 a share last month when it 
appeared that a 675 billion buyout proposal by wolf uniteds 
pilots union and british airways plc would succeed the deal soured 
three weeks ago when the group said it couldnt get adequate 
financing for the 300ashare bid 
steinberg helped lure wolf to run tiger international inc when 
steinberg was a director and major investor in the air cargo 
company its subsidiary flying tiger which has since merged with 
federal express corp became profitable under wolf who went on 
to join ual then called allegis corp in 1987 
now wolf is the one needing help and steinberg may be looking to 
return the favor said jack hunter an analyst with howe barnes 
investments inc in chicago 
he steinberg might be the catalyst to say hey this 
company is a good company its undervalued lets get the unions 
and everybody together and see if we can all walk forward 
hunter said 
support from uniteds unions especially the pilots and the 
powerful machinists is believed to be crucial to any transaction 
whether instigated by uals board of directors or an outsider 
the machinists union bitterly opposed the proposed 
pilotmanagement buyout but union officials have recently taken a 
conciliatory stance and say they are willing to compromise to 
prevent an outside takeover 
but the machinists who represent more than a third of uals 
workers expressed wariness thursday about steinberg 
it looks like hes looking to run ual stock up again said 
union spokesman james conley in washington dc we will probably 
take a look at everything that comes down the road but were 
opposed to running ual stock up again to the point where we feel 
the stock is overpriced 
hunter figured a fair price for ual stock is 190 to 220 a 
share 
neither the pilots nor uniteds flight attendants would comment 
on the steinberg development the flight attendants joined the 
pilotmanagement group last month after british airways dropped out 
analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley amp co in new york said 
recent highvolume trading of ual stock indicated that another 
party may have acquired a substantial stake in the company 
that partys identity might be revealed in the next several 
days he said through a securities and exchange commission filing 
required of investors who make large purchases of a companys stock 
if a takeoverminded third party does surface murphy said the 
employeemanagement group may feel compelled to make a new buyout 
bid at a lower price 
as for steinberg he said i think hes being prepared to 
perhaps be allied with his old business friend steve wolf in the 
event there is a bid

foreigners and dampen their need for dollars

jaguar plc said thursday it was joining the ford 
motor co fleet in a 25 billion buyout a surprising reversal 
that saw ford winning over a venerable luxury car maker that once 
labeled it an unwanted suitor 
the deal which combines the vast resources of the american 
automaker with the high style of the much smaller british firm is 
expected to further the interests of both companies in the growing 
international market for luxury cars 
the partnership we are proposing will enable jaguar to grow 
and become increasingly competitive lindsay halstead chairman 
of ford europe said at a news conference 
to win over jaguar ford had to beat back a challenge from its 
chief rival general motors corp which had been negotiating for 
months to acquire a stake in jaguar 
soon after the deal was announced gm the worlds biggest 
automaker said it would not bid against no 2 ford for the company 
jaguar shareholders must approve the 1335ashare takeover 
offer by a 75 percent majority a shareholder meeting is scheduled 
for the end of the month 
jaguar which has roots dating to 1922 had been expected to be 
the target of a multibilliondollar bidding war between general 
motors and ford after the british government announced tuesday that 
it was prepared to waive its golden share power to veto any 
jaguar takeover 
ford owns 132 percent of jaguar and had indicated it would 
mount a buyout bid once takeover restrictions were dropped general 
motors had acquired regulatory approval to buy up to 15 percent of 
jaguar and its friendly talks with the automaker had been expected 
to result in a gm stake of possibly 30 percent 
but general motors concluded jaguar was not worth the 1335 a 
share ford offered to pay 
after an intensive review of jaguars products and plants and 
in view of the losses currently being sustained by them together 
with jaguars significant future cash and other requirements gm 
concluded that the maximum value that could be assigned to all of 
the jaguar shares was very significantly below the 850 pounds 
1335 being offered a gm statement read 
jaguar finished at the equivalent of 1302 a share thursday on 
londons stock exchange down from wednesdays close of 1426 
analysts said that although ford was not jaguars first choice 
the british carmaker should thrive under its ownership 
jaguar saw its pretax profit drop by nearly 6 percent in the 
first half of 1989 largely due to slumping us sales it has been 
looking for 18 months for a partner to provide financial and 
technological support to expand its narrow product line and compete 
better 
jaguar chairman sir john egan told a news conference thursday 
that he regretted jaguars loss of independence but he said ford 
offered a good price and made guarantees about operating 
independence 
jaguar will be run as a separate entity will retain an 
independent board of directors its production in britain will 
continue and jaguars dealer network will be maintained the 
companies said egan also will remain for the immediate future 
to put it simply the board had a very good offer indeed 
egan said they were prepared to make satisfactory guarantees 
about how jaguar would be operated in the future 
some britons immediately regretted the loss of a truly british 
institution 
the opposition liberal democrats accused the government of 
scuttling jaguars negotiations with general motors by dropping its 
veto power party member matthew taylor accused the government of 
sending the autonomy of the british car industry to the scrap 
heap 
fords halstead said there was considerable potential to 
increase sales volume by expanding jaguars product range in 
europe the united states and elsewhere 
he said ford would inject an unspecified amount of funds into 
jaguar to develop the companys existing product range and boost 
its research and development jaguar also will be able to use 
fords worldwide engineering purchasing and manufacturing 
technologies

president bush on thursday commended two 
companies xerox corp and the milliken amp co textile company as 
examples of firms that are leading the resurgence in american 
business leadership 
bush presented the 1989 malcolm baldrige national quality award 
named for the late commerce secretary to the chairmen of the two 
companies in a ceremony at the commerce department 
bush said the two companies responded to the need for 
improvement in quality and service by us companies which are 
national priorities as never before 
in recent years americans have felt the sting of fierce 
competition on a global scale and weve learned to see foreign 
competition not as an excuse to close doors and raise barriers but 
as an incentive to renew our own commitment to excellence 
the president lauded both xerox and milliken for creative 
management practices 
theyre leading the resurgence in american business 
leadership he said most companies catch hell from the 
competition but these two companies are in the lead because no 
competitor gave them a tougher time than they gave themselves 
bush said there was a time when both xerox and milliken were 
being steadily squeezed out by the intense foreign and domestic 
competition in the midst of this crisis the men and women of 
these companies found within themselves the will to make a 
painstaking reassessment and the drive to win back that market 
share 
xerox the stamford connbased copyproducts giant employs 
50200 people throughout the country and makes more than 250 kinds 
of documentprocessing equipment its 1988 us sales topped 6 
billion 
the privately owned milliken headquartered in spartanburg 
sc has 28 businesses that produce textile and chemical products 
with annual sales of more than 1 billion 
millikens 14300 employees are called associates of the 
company whose management structure relies heavily on teams such as 
the corrective active teams formed to address manufacturing and 
business problems and supplier action teams that deal with the 
firms relationships with its suppliers 
the malcolm baldrige award honors the memory of the commerce 
secretary and rodeo enthusiast who was killed in a freak accident 
in july 1987 he was crushed by a horse that fell on him while he 
was cattle roping

president bush and senate republicans offered 
thursday to end their attempts to attach a capital gains tax cut to 
crucial debt legislation all but conceding defeat for the year on 
what has been bushs top legislative priority 
we have tried to work constructively and cooperatively with 
the congress in a true spirit of bipartisanship said a statement 
from the president now the stalemate must be broken 
with an increase in the national debt limit needed next week to 
stave off a default by the treasury senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan told democrats that republicans would agree to limit 
amendments to the debtceiling legislation to those repealing a 
medicare tax to finance catastrophic illness coverage and a tax 
provision opposed by business 
no capital gains amendment will be offered he said on the 
senate floor minutes after a meeting with top white house officials 
including chief of staff john sununu treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and budget director richard darman 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who met 
thursday evening with house speaker thomas foley dwash and 
other democratic leaders said afterwards they were heartened by 
the statement made by the president 
mitchell said he would make a counteroffer to dole and were 
not rejecting anything he declined to offer details 
democratic sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
they found the gop proposal attractive they wanted however to 
make sure the republicans would end backdoor attempts to win 
approval of a capital gains tax cut such as a pending amendment to 
attach it to a bill providing aid to poland and hungary 
a white house statement said bushs primary interest was in 
reducing the federal deficit and preventing democrats from adding 
costly new programs 
republicans have been trying for weeks to break a democratic 
blockade of their plan to cut the capital gains tax democrats have 
called the tax cut a giveaway to the rich and accused bush and the 
republicans of sacrificing other priorities in their pursuit of the 
tax cut 
i deeply regret the tone of partisanship that has entered the 
economic policy debate bush said in the statement i would 
very much have preferred a fair and balanced debate and vote on 
the merits but the congressional process has bogged down 
the stalemate has delayed the legislative agenda to the point 
where the government is threatened with default next week because 
the treasurys 28 trillion debt limit has not been raised 
by attaching the popular tax repeal measures to the debtceiling 
bill republicans would take away from the democrats the most 
attractive features of a separate tax and entitlement bill now 
being negotiated between the house and the senate democrats would 
lose leverage for their sometimes costly initiatives in that bill 
including expanding health care benefits for the poor 
the tax and entitlement bills underlying purpose is to reduce 
the federal deficit selectively and thus cancel 161 billion in 
spending cuts that took effect oct 1 because congress and the 
president had failed to meet the goals of the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
republicans said that their move was designed to force democrats 
to pass a clean deficitreduction bill or face the prospect of 
leaving the grammrudman cuts in place 
if the congress cannot agree upon a clean deficitreduction 
bill that fully meets the test of fiscal responsibility we are 
prepared to manage the government under the grammrudman cuts 
for as long as it takes to reach agreement on a fiscally 
responsible bill said the white house statement 
before democrats could consider the offer republican sen steve 
symms of idaho blocked senate action on a bipartisan plan to raise 
the minimum wage for the first time in eight years symms refused 
to allow debate unless he were given a chance to add amendments on 
capital gains and repealing catastrophic illness coverage and the 
business tax rule known as section 89 
adopted by congress last year but not yet put into effect by the 
internal revenue service section 89 would deny tax breaks to 
companies that do not offer the same health benefits to all levels 
of employees 
democrats on thursday said republican suggestions that the 
automatic cuts remain in place were the irresponsible approach 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the grammrudman cuts would cancel the planned 
increase in fighting illegal drugs cost one million students their 
college grants and hurt the pentagon veterans and the homeless 
it is really a cowards approach to deficit reduction he 
said 
dole said supporters of reducing the capital gains tax would 
continue to pursue their goal on other bills by redoubling our 
efforts senate rules however appeared to reduce their chances 
of success 
rep robert michel rill the house minority leader said he 
was willing to live with the automatic cuts for a while but he 
considered the increase in the debt ceiling crucial 
we cant let the government topple on that capital gains 
issue at least the governments ability to pay its bills honor 
its commitments said michel who also attended the meeting 
the congressional republicans indicated there was frustration on 
the part of the white house 
we have to keep telling the governor former new hampshire 
gov sununu from time to time its not quite like dealing with the 
legislature because the president doesnt have lineitem veto 
power and some other things like that michel said

the last edition of the oncepowerful los 
angeles herald examiner hit the streets thursday but only briefly 
as souvenir seekers cleaned out most newsracks shortly after dawn 
entrepreneurs were reportedly getting as much as 20 a copy for 
the papers with a bold so long la headline 
some kid on fraternity row flagged down the herald truck when 
it got here this morning and bought six bundles of 50 papers 
each said gary pine at the sports information office at the 
university of southern california 
the last we heard hed sold three bundles at 20 a copy 
at a herald examiner building downtown crowds jammed a lobby to 
buy papers some like robert fregoso purchased whole 50paper 
bundles for the normal 25 cents a copy 
ive read the herald all my life said fregoso 43 i used 
to sell them on the street 35 years ago down on alameda and 42nd 
fregoso said he was going to give the papers away to his best 
customers at rickys a cocktail lounge he runs 
morning sales at the spot where fregoso picked up his papers 
were as brisk as 1000 copies an hour herald examiner employee 
belen cruz said 
scores of buyers lined up on the street to get copies when the 
presses shut down about 4 pm more than 370000 papers had been 
distributed according to production director ray willis half 
again as much as usual 
the herald examiner was born in 1962 when the morning examiner 
founded by newspaper baron william randolph hearst in 1903 was 
merged with the evening herald express founded in 1871 and became 
the citys sole afternoon paper 
the herald examiner and its predecessors were a huge part of the 
citys newspapering lore 
thousands of dollars were once kept in a safe in case hearst 
needed quick cash or a reporter had to be bailed out of jail the 
examiner had scoops on everything from the black dahlia murder 
case to the explosion of the first hbomb 
but the problems at the herald examiner once the largest 
afternoon paper in the country with a circulation of more than 
700000 were longstanding officials acknowledged in announcing 
its closure wednesday 
at the same time hearst merged the two papers into one afternoon 
daily in 1962 times mirror corp merged its times and mirror into 
the morningdelivery times that started a gradual slide in 
circulation and advertising away from the herald examiner 
the mortal blow was a bitter 10year strike beginning in 1967 
hearst tried to recover by hiring talented editors broadening 
coverage beyond the traditional bluecollar sportsandcrime 
emphasis and changing to morning publication 
journalists plan a wake for the herald examiner on sunday 
night at the los angeles press club 
the demise of the herald examiner is like the death of an old 
friend wrote daily variety columnist army archerd especially 
for those of us who worked there in the halcyon days of the hearst 
newspaper empire when it was the heraldexpress 
john morton a newspaper analyst at the lynch jones amp ryan 
brokerage firm in washington said the herald had improved 
dramatically in recent years 
but once you get as far down in circulation in comparison with 
your competitor as they were you can be the best newspaper in 
america and its not going to add to your advertising revenue 
morton said 
with a daily circulation of 238000 compared to the times 11 
million and with losses exceeding 15 million per month hearst 
tried to find a buyer for the herald then announced the shutdown 
when no one could be found

newspapers scrambled thursday to capitalize 
on the death of the herald examiner by adding news racks snaring 
prize comics and courting advertisers 
but analysts and newspaper officials said most papers in the 
area will be little affected and even if they pick up readers they 
will have to wait at least six months before they can pass on the 
costs of printing additional papers to advertisers 
i would think there will be some costs before there are some 
benefits said newspaper industry analyst john s reidy at drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
in addition many of the heralds ads are already carried by 
other papers 
the surviving newspapers are going to get some additional 
readers but are not going to get much incremental advertising 
said j kendrick noble who follows the media industry for paine 
webber group inc 
papers geared up immediately after hearst corp announced 
wednesday it would close the herald which published its last issue 
thursday after years of big losses 
thomas j wafer jr general manager of copley los angeles 
which owns the outlook in santa monica the daily breeze in 
torrance and the news pilot in san pedro said we intend to beef 
up all three to pick up as much advertising as we can 
the long beach presstelegram said it will increase the number 
of its news racks and may launch an advertising campaign im 
sure all of us will be vying for a piece of those readers said 
mack quintana senior vice president of sales and marketing 
the herald examiners syndicated features and comics also went 
up for grabs and former competitors quickly moved in 
the los angeles times has agreed to pick up several of our 
biggest features including beetle bailey hagar the horrible and 
hi amp lois said ted hannah director of advertising and public 
relations for king features in new york 
the times said it would purchase more than 10000 of the herald 
examiners news racks officials estimated the paper would pick up 
at most 50000 of the heralds 238000 readers 
we hope to convert them to times readers said times 
publisher david laventhol 
but he added you are dealing with a relatively small pie 
here and it probably wont affect the marketplace its sad but 
true 
david j auger publisher of the san fernando valleybased daily 
news agreed saying the heralds circulation was spread over the 
entire greater los angeles area and was relatively insignificant in 
suburban areas like the valley and orange county 
the impact is fairly negligible in our area auger said

just days after fujitsu ltd failed in its attempt 
to escape a contract for which it bid 1 yen or about 07 of a us 
cent the japanese computer giant said wednesday it was trying to 
withdraw from another 1yen deal it says lacks common sense 
akira imagawa a spokesman at fujitsus headquarters in tokyo 
said company officials in the nagano prefecture in central japan 
had asked nagano authorities to cancel a contract the company won 
last month with a 1yen bid 
both cases have attracted the attention of japans fair trade 
commission whose officials say they are considering an 
investigation into whether the unusually low bids constitute unfair 
trade under the antimonopoly law 
in the nagano deal fujitu and electronics giant nec corp made 
identical 1yen bids for a contract to design software for the 
prefectural libarys computer system local officials said 
the prefectural government had set aside 16 million yen or 
about 112000 in its budget for the project the officials said 
on condition of anonymity 
frontline salesmen desperately wanted to win the contract 
but lacked common sense imagawa said 
in the earlier case fujitsu officials having said their 1yen 
bid to design software to map the hiroshima city water supply 
system represented a longterm investment later appeared to change 
their minds and asked the city to cancel the contract the city had 
budgeted 11 million yen or 78000 for the project 
city officials refused although they said their decision would 
depend on the outcome of a possible fair trade commission 
investigation 
we will continue to seek the citys understanding to retract 
the contract fujitsus imagawa said 
meanwhile officials of the ministry of international trade and 
industry cautioned fujitsu on tuesday about business practices 
beyond common sense said an official of the ministrys 
electronics policy division 
the official who spoke anonymously said the ministry also 
urged major member companies in the japan electronics industry 
development associaton a industrial grouping of computer and 
electronics makers not to make discount sales at irrational 
prices 
companies competing for both the hiroshima and the nagano 
contracts reportedly saw the projects as a way to get a head start 
on computer systems expected to be linked up throughout the country 
but makoto sakata a noted commentator said the cases also 
demonstrated that corporate ethics lag behind generally accepted 
rules of behavior with companies emphasizing their relations with 
local officials rather than profitability 
looking at what japans leading hightechnology companies like 
fujitsu and nec are doing its painfully clear that modernaization 
of japanese corporations is superficial and that they in fact 
remain unchanged from the feudal age sakata said
