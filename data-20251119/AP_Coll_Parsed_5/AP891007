manfred hees a correspondent for the associated 
press arrived in prague nearly two weeks ago to cover the exodus 
of east germans to the west here he tells of the scene at the west 
german embassy in prague and the refugees hopes of being allowed 
to go to freedom 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the garden of pragues baroque 
lobkowicz palace that houses the west german embassy once was the 
envy of neighboring diplomats 
but the clipped lawns have been churned to mud by the pacing of 
thousands of east germans who invested their last hope in 
emigration to the west 
as the last refugees left the embassy compound the grounds and 
the street outside looked like a battlefield 
the refuse of hope and anxiety lay scattered inside and outside 
the fence that for thousands of east germans marked the iron 
curtain dividing the communist east from the free west 
for those inside journalists recording the event were for a 
long time their only contact with the outside world and their only 
source of information 
what do they think about us in west germany i was asked 
daily are you reporting on us are you writing about us 
ringed off in their corner of the west in the heart of the 
communist east many were concerned they had been forgotten 
uncertainty and anxiety marked their daily routine and waiting 
waiting 4 or 5 hours to use one of the two toilets available for 
several thousand people waiting to take a shower waiting for a 
bed to become free so one could sleep 
its worth it they said we want to reach the west 
when i arrived in prague nearly two weeks ago the balmy summer 
weather had just come to an abrupt end a cold rain pelted down 
through the night soaking the ground 
the tents were so overcrowded that many of the men were forced 
to sleep in the open in army sleeping bags they cut open cardboard 
boxes and spread them on the ground to try to keep out some of the 
damp 
in those first days the refugees would talk telling of the 
lives they left behind but more anxious to hear about life in west 
germany trying to divine a picture of the future 
is there work in west germany how high is the 
unemployment how much does an apartment cost 
many were initially mistrustful fearful i could be a member of 
the east german secret police 
one small boy hanging constantly on his fathers hand was 
fascinated by my boots for him a symbol of the west he had seen on 
tv are those real cowboy boots he asked each time he saw me 
can i see them 
there were stunning scenes of compassion 
one rainy dawn a young woman and her mother came up to the 
embassys main door the daughter originally was from east berlin 
but now lives in munich west germany 
her mother wept and clung to her as she ushered her gently 
toward the entrance 
mother you must go in the daughter pleaded i cant go 
with you then she added i feel as though i were sending you 
to an orphanage 
as she turned to leave she told us her mother had been 
imprisoned for five years for attempting to leave the country 
illegally 
one man asked me to call his wife in west germany whom he had 
not seen for over a year she had thought he was going to try to 
swim across the danube river to hungary from where east germans can 
legally cross to the west he didnt want her to worry 
prague residents who at first seemed indifferent to the 
refugees gradually became interested in their plight coming to 
the embassy with chocolate for the children and passing out hot 
tea to those sitting out in the cold 
as the east germans began boarding buses to take them to the 
train station wednesday night crowds of czechoslovaks gathered to 
applaud them and wave them off 
as workers begin to clean up the embassy garden and the streets 
outside remnants poignantly recalled the drama that marked the few 
days the refugees spent there 
at the edge of the fence a broken baby carriage a single 
abandoned shoe recalled the panic of two days earlier when 
hundreds of east germans desperate to be included in the exodus 
stormed police barricades and clambered over the fence to join more 
than 4000 others 
gripped by panic that they could be left behind many scaled the 
buildings ornate facade climbing through the windows or jumping 
from the top of the 6foothigh fence 
mothers and fathers lifted their babies over the fence placing 
them in the hands of strangers the panic of separation written on 
their faces for the eternal moments before they themselves 
clambered over to join them unsure if police would move in to stop 
them 
the abandoned east german trabant and wartburg cars are being 
removed from the streets to a parking lot many of the east germans 
simply left the cars and threw away the keys as the trains pulled 
out of the prague station

president bush is defending his decision not 
to intervene militarily to help overthrow panamas gen manuel 
antonio noriega while his aides try to quash criticism that the 
administration operated in confusion during the failed coup 
but the president said friday that his inaction should not be 
read as a signal that he would act the same way if another attempt 
is made by panamanians 
i would not rule out any option he told reporters when 
asked if he would send in the military next time 
bush said that after reviewing information about the coup he 
believes he was right not to unleash us forces stationed in the 
south american nation 
im not being stubborn but as i look at all the information i 
wouldnt have made a different decision then bush said 
but questions and criticisms from capitol hill and even some 
administration officials persisted as to whether it would have 
been wiser to help the insurgents in the panamanian defense forces 
who tried to topple the dictator 
bush explained his position during a closeddoor meeting with 
senate republicans and later talked to reporters about the matter 
outside walter reed army medical center where he had a cyst 
removed from his finger 
we were willing to use force but not unless we know the 
circumstances and have better information presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said bush told senators 
sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee 
charged friday that a lack of clear policy guidance from bush was 
largely responsible for us confusion there should have been 
definite arrangements for how us troops were to react in the 
event of a coup he said 
we have had a definite longstanding policy in this country of 
encouraging a coup in panama the georgia democrat told 
reporters we should anticipate that our policy might 
succeed then we have to know what were going to do next 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff testified in closed session before the 
senate intelligence and armed services committees which are 
reviewing discrepancies surrounding us involvement with the coup 
contact with its participants and advance notice 
sen john warner rva said both insisted they would not 
have changed their decision and recommendations to the president 
a senior administration official however has said there are 
things the administration should have handled differently 
bush said the decision not to use force was made because it 
wasnt warranted under the existing circumstances 
the commanderinchief must have the lives of american 
citizens foremost in mind when making such a decision he said 
bush and fitzwater disputed the assertion of sen jesse helms 
rnc that the rebels wanted to turn noriega over to the united 
states 
the president said he still wants to see noriega removed from 
power but there was never a chance to have him handed over to 
us 
fitzwater trying to clarify other conflicting reports reversed 
his earlier statement that us officials had not been in direct 
contact in advance with any coup leaders 
he confirmed that us representatives had been in touch before 
tuesday with coup leader maj moises giroldi who is believed dead 
giroldi fitzwater said told the representatives sunday that the 
coup would occur 
earlier fitzwater had said that advance word had come through a 
third party 
fitzwater emphatically denied a wall street journal report that 
giroldis wife had tried to alert us officials about the coup 
three weeks ago 
fitzwater also told reporters 
a cable transmitted to washington by us military officials in 
panama incorrectly stated that the rebels wanted the united states 
to take custody of noriega fitzwater said the cable should have 
said the rebels wont let the us have custody 
but he said it was irrelevant to bushs decisions because the 
incorrect cable didnt reach the white house 
despite early suspicions that giroldi might actually be 
operating a set up instead of a real coup effort us 
officials now believe he was sincere 
disputing a wall street journal report fitzwater denied that 
the rebels had ever asked the united states to deploy a helicopter 
to take noriega into custody

independent investigators say in a highly 
critical report that there were dangerous amounts of plutonium in 
uncontrolled conditions at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
but that there was no evidence of an accidental nuclear reaction 
this is at least the seventh report ive received from the 
department of energy in the last three years that says rocky flats 
suffers from lax safety attitudes and that also admits things 
just arent improving said rep david skaggs dcolo whose 
district includes the 364acre plant near golden 
the inspectors said in a report on safety conditions at the 
plant that many changes are needed to improve controls on plutonium 
used to shape triggers for nuclear warheads 
fridays report said that while no evidence was found that an 
accidental nuclear reaction had ever occurred at rocky flats there 
is a real possibility of such a disaster because the plant 
operator doesnt properly control all its plutonium 
an accidental reaction would produce a lethal dose of radiation 
to workers 
the study conducted between july and september by scientech 
inc an engineering and management company based in idaho falls 
idaho said there had been about eight serious violations of 
plutonium safety procedures at rocky flats since 1962 
those incidents lefts an unacceptable margin of safety the 
report said 
skaggs said the report was further evidence that problems at 
rocky flats are getting worse 
the fbi has been investigating possible environmental violations 
at rocky flats since june and a special grand jury has been 
impaneled in denver to consider the case 
rocky flats reprocesses plutonium in retired nuclear weapons to 
make triggers for new warheads the facility is owned by the energy 
department and run under a government contract by rockwell 
international corp which earlier this month said it would quit 
the plant soon the new contractor will be egampg inc 
the investigators said they discovered several kilograms of 
plutonium239 in a pipe that serves as an exhaust ventilation duct 
in a plutonium processing building it was found outside the 
normal envelope used to control plutonium inventories and the 
quantity was more than enough for an accidental reaction 
before the investigation plant managers had insisted that 
this type of plutonium accumulation was not happening even 
though a former employee had warned of the possibility the report 
said 
even so the investigators said the material posed no 
immediate danger to public or worker safety 
the report added however that the investigators found 
indications that there may be undiscovered accumulations of 
significant amounts of plutonium in several other exhaust ducts at 
rocky flats no other details on that were provided 
the report said a former rockwell employee who designed the 
ventilation system james stone had warned rockwell that the ducts 
were a probable location for dangerous quantities of plutonium to 
collect 
despite the warning rockwell didnt identify and correct 
plutonium accumulations in ventilation systems the report said 
the investigators also said plant workers who provided anonymous 
tips on where to look for unsafe conditions were afraid to raise 
their concerns to their supervisors 
energy secretary james d watkins ordered the investigation in 
response to reports that manmade radioactive elements found at 
rocky flats might have been formed by an inadvertent nuclear 
reaction there is no nuclear reactor at the plant so speculation 
had centered on the possibility of a chain reaction caused by 
accumulations of plutonium 
an appendix to the report said that since the start of the 
nuclear age in the early 1940s 35 accidental nuclear reactions had 
occurred worldwide and that seven such accidents had occurred 
between 1958 and 1978 at unidentified us nuclear processing 
facilities 
the seven us accidents resulted in two deaths and 19 
significant overexposures of workers but virtually no exposure 
to the public the report said

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
offering assurances that israels peace plan is very alive is 
asking the bush administration to help break a deadlock over 
mideast negotiations 
shamir made the move friday after the israeli cabinet rejected 
by tie vote a labor party proposal to meet with egypt on the touchy 
issue of which palestinian arabs should participate in negotiations 
the prime minister said israel had not closed the door on the 
peace process in fact shamir said the israeli peace 
initiative is very alive 
shamirs request for us diplomatic intervention was aired in 
an interview with israel television and elaborated in discussions 
between us and israeli officials 
he called on secretary of state james a baker iii to set up 
talks with egypt and israel on the composition of a palestinian 
delegation 
egyptian president hosni mubarak proposed last month that two 
palestinians deported by israel during disorders on the west bank 
and in gaza should be included shamir and his supporters objected 
a us official who demanded anonymity said baker was 
considering shamirs request as well as other ways to set up 
israelipalestinian negotiations the official insisted the peace 
process was not at a dead end 
we are working hard and we are hopeful he said 
baker spoke by telephone with israeli foreign minister moshe 
arens and egyptian foreign minister esmet abdelmeguid after the 
cabinet vote 
us officials said the cabinet had not dealt with other issues 
surrounding the negotiations and that the discussion was expected 
to resume next week in jerusalem 
baker meanwhile looked for openings for compromise 
state department spokesman richard boucher insisted israel had 
not rejected mubaraks 10point proposal 
our view is that the israeli cabinet has held a full 
discussion and neither accepted nor rejected the egyptian ideas 
he said 
mubarak had proposed the negotiations in cairo between an 
israeli delegation and palestinians including the two deportees 
deputy prime minister shimon peres and defense minister yitzhak 
rabin leading members of the labor party approved 
mubaraks approach would require israel to concede in advance 
that it should relinquish territory on the west bank and in gaza as 
a basis for gaining peace with the arabs again peres and rabin 
agreed 
the egyptian leader put his proposal forward after the palestine 
liberation organization declined to endorse a plan by shamir to 
hold elections among the 14 million palestinian arabs who live in 
the territories 
after baker met last week in new york with arens and 
abdelmeguid he called on the israeli cabinet to decide how to 
move forward on the shamir proposal otherwise baker said at a 
news conference friday we will have to go back to the drawing 
board 
but after the deadlock us officials said there was no reason 
to start anew and that baker would seek an accommodation between 
the shamir and mubarak plans 
any conclusion that its over because it didnt happen today 
is just not right boucher said i dont think the secretary 
put any time limit on this 
baker he said was not planning to go to the middle east 
baker endorsed the shamir plan after it was adopted by the 
israeli cabinet in may he has also praised the 10 points unveiled 
by mubarak last month but said they were no substitute for 
shamirs proposal 
on a related subject boucher confirmed reports that robert 
pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia recently held two 
additional meetings with a plo official however he declined to 
disclose what they talked about 
the plo news agency wafa said the meetings concerned the 
efforts under way and the positions of the different concerned 
parties to realize a net gain in the peace process 
pelletreau has been meeting in carthage with plo officials since 
december the state department has given only skimpy reports of the 
sessions

pope john paul ii arrived in south 
korea saturday to begin a 10day pilgrimage to asia that is 
expected to focus on human rights and catholicmoslem relations 
the popes special alitalia boeing 747 landed in south korea 
after leaving romes leonardo da vinci airport and making a brief 
refueling stop in venice 
in a sign of vastly improved vaticansoviet relations the 
kremlin approved a flight plan that allowed the papal plane to fly 
over the soviet union china barred a papal overflight 
the asian trip the 44th foreign pilgrimage of john pauls 
11year papacy raises several politically sensitive topics for the 
pope 
in seoul the pope is scheduled to address a religious meeting 
that has taken up the issue of eventual reunification of north and 
south korea 
his next stop is overwhelmingly moslem indonesia and a stop in 
east timor a heavily catholic island annexed by indonesia after 
its invasion of 1975 
john paul will also make a twoday stop in the indian ocean 
island nation of mauritius before returning to rome oct 16 
south korean police and intelligence agencies were placed on top 
alert for the popes visit his second to the country following a 
major tour in 1984 national police headquarters in seoul said a 
special watch was being maintained for members of the gray 
wolves identified as an ultrarightist turkish underground group 
in 1981 a turkish man alleged to be a member of the gray wolves 
shot the pope in st peters square 
the pope came to address the closing of the 44th international 
eucharistic congress which has included discussions about eventual 
reunification of north and south korea 
the seoul government is extremely wary about efforts to reunite 
the two koreas which are technically at war since no peace treaty 
was signed at the end of the korean war in 1953 on thursday a 
dissident pastor who made a secret trip to north korea for 
reunification talks was sentenced to 10 years in prison for aiding 
an enemy power 
church officials say a small group of catholics from north korea 
were invited for the papal visit but are not expected to be allowed 
to attend by their communist government 
in an article published thursday by the vatican newspaper 
losservatore romano south korean cardinal stephen kim described 
the division of korea as a symbol of a divided world that so 
ardently desires peace and reconciliation 
after seoul the pope will spend five days touring indonesia 
while the scope of the visit is to meet with the tiny minority of 5 
million catholics in the population of 175 million john paul is 
expected to stress the need for good relations between moslems and 
christians 
the indonesian stop has been clouded by a fury over east timor 
this week portuguese president mario soares called indonesia 
dictatorial and accused the indonesian government of 
persecuting east timors catholic population 
i hope that his holiness will carry the message hes always 
carrying in defense of the oppressed and the victims of 
persecution soares said 
the vatican has not recognized east timors annexation and the 
bishop of timor is directly under the jurisdiction of the vatican 
and not a member of the indonesian bishops conference 
the vatican newspaper said john paul wanted to make the stop 
scheduled for only half a day to comfort catholics so harshly 
tested

some of the jurors thought the most 
stimulating part of sousa vs pensacola christian college was the 
cookbook they wrote during the trial 
it was the perfect recipe for combatting the tedium of a recent 
civil trial that dragged on for four weeks with jurors often 
leaving the courtroom while attorneys argued details 
every time there was an objection there would be a 15 to 
20minute delay juror linda kinchen said and we couldnt talk 
about the case so we started talking about food 
the jurors began reading recipes in magazines and then brought 
in recipes from home to share some even brought in samples of 
their favorite dish 
eventually they started writing out their recipes in longhand 
and categorizing them into groups such as appetizers main dishes 
salads or desserts 
the jury for the civil fraud case decided to call their book 
courtroom cooks n crooks we steal recipes 
circuit court judge robert makemson was given a copy of the book 
at the end of the trial 
they probably got tired of talking about their grandchildren 
so they thought of this makemson said more power to them

the government has granted the 
longstanding demand of black trade unions to have a public holiday 
on may 1 the international labor day 
the decision announced friday came after years of government 
resistence 
black workers have staged widespread strikes on may day in 
recent years to press their demand for a holiday and they rejected 
a compromise move by the government two years ago to have a 
workers day holiday on the first friday in may 
certain groups of persons object to may 1 as a public holiday 
by virtue of its association with the socialistic and communistic 
ideology said manpower minister eli louw however the recent 
past has clearly shown that its association with socialism is 
becoming irrelevant because of the economic failure of that 
ideology 
the holiday will be called workers day louw said 
south africas largest employer organization the association of 
chambers of commerce and industry said the change removed an 
issue of contention that has been extremely disruptive to 
business

a man who says he was questioned by the fbi in 
the bombing of a van belonging to the former captain of the uss 
vincennes alleges an extramarital affair may be behind the attack 
the san diego tribune reported friday 
george marxmiller said he told the fbi shortly after the march 
10 bombing that capt will rogers had been having a threeyear 
affair with a woman in kensington md a suburb of washington 
dc the newspaper reported 
the fbi declined comment on the case and the rogers attorney 
called the allegations irresponsible and wrong 
rogers wife sharon narrowly escaped injury when she jumped 
out of the toyota minivan when a pipe bomb exploded under it at an 
intersection in la jolla the fbi initially focused its 
investigation on a possible terrorist attack 
both the san diego union and the los angeles times reported 
earlier this week that federal investigators think someone with a 
grudge against the former skipper and not revengeminded 
terrorists may have been behind the bombing 
on monday the union quoted an anonymous navy official as saying 
the focus of the investigation had switched to a us citizen who 
has a personal vendetta against rogers 
the day before the times quoted four unidentified sources as 
saying the probe was now on the personal vendetta theory the fbi 
however has said it hasnt ruled out the possibility that the 
bombing could be a terrorist attack 
will rogers was the captain of the vincennes in july 1988 when 
it shot down an iranian jetliner over the persian gulf killing all 
290 aboard rogers later was exonerated on the grounds he had 
reason to believe his ship was to be attacked by a fighter 
he has since taken another assignment away from the vincennes 
marxmiller 48 of buckhead ga said he knew of rogers affair 
because the 42yearold kensington woman was a best friend of his 
estranged wife rebecca the newspaper said the names of will 
rogers and the kensington woman are among a list of names of 
potential witnesses in rebecca marxmillers divorce suit against 
her husband according to the times which did not name the woman 
rogers attorney pat shea told the associated press that 
rogers only met the marxmillers once several years ago and that 
rogers didnt know why he was being sought as a witness in their 
divorce 
the innuendo that you can draw from george marxmillers 
comments pointing in anyway at capt rogers are way off base they 
are irresponsible and they are wrong shea said 
rebecca marxmiller released a statement through her attorney 
friday saying that her husband is trying to discredit a third 
person who may be a witness at their divorce trial 
marxmiller told the tribune that he and his wife spent a weekend 
in portland ore in 1987 with will rogers and the woman during a 
rose festival the vincennes was docked in portland at the time 
the newspaper said two of its reporters saw photos of rogers 
the kensington woman and the marxmillers one shows rogers and the 
woman with their arms around each other and the vincennes in the 
background another shows her hugging rogers from behind 
marxmiller told the tribune that many of his friends have been 
questioned by federal agents and that the home of his brother tom 
in the los angeles area was searched by fbi agents earlier this 
week 
marxmillers wife of 22 years demanded a divorce last year 
marxmiller who said he is a pilot for eastern airlines said he 
became emotionally upset and decided not to fly for three months 
eastern airlines then went on strike and his income fell to 
almost nothing he said

the white house and senate democrats are close 
to an agreement that would speed work on a deficitreduction bill 
and guarantee a quick separate vote on president bushs coveted 
capital gains tax cut 
leaders of both parties culminated a day of meetings among 
themselves and administration officials friday by announcing they 
had all but agreed to weed dozens of specialinterest provisions 
including the capital gains proposal out of a budgetcutting 
measure 
senate leaders planned to meet with their house counterparts 
today to nail down a final hurdle 
bush and his gop allies wanted house assurances that that 
chamber which approved its own capital gains cut this week would 
agree to work out a compromise with the senate 
i think were pretty close to an agreement senate finance 
committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas told reporters 
early friday bush had journeyed to capitol hill to discuss the 
offers and counteroffers and to voice his continued support for 
paring back capital gains tax rates 
capital gains is vital he said before the meeting its 
not an extraneous matter with me 
the agreement was spurred by a desire by both parties to avoid 
an approaching budget embarrassment automatic spending cuts that 
otherwise most likely be triggered oct 16 by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
under that law unless the projected deficit for fiscal 1990 
which began sunday is reduced to 110 billion defense and many 
domestic programs will automatically be cut to obey that budget 
ceiling the deficitreduction bill will have to be passed 
but the legislation has collected many provisions that have 
little to do with reducing the governments red ink and a lot to do 
with helping various interest groups 
dozens were tacked on by the senate finance committee at a 
latenight session this week including a 685million fiveyear 
tax benefit for some natural gas producers and a 25 million tax 
break for owners of tuxedo rental shops 
in addition advocates of reducing the capital gains tax had 
planned to try to add their proposal to the budgetcutting measure 
that and the other extraneous provisions promised to make quick 
completion of the bill all but impossible 
bentsen agreed to drop his own proposal to restore individual 
retirement account benefits from the bill if the capital gains 
effort was also abandoned 
the house approved its own version of the deficitreduction bill 
thursday on a 33391 vote a measure that included a temporary 
reduction in capital gains tax rates 
capital gains are profits from the sale of investments and are 
now taxed at the same rates as other income 
under the housepassed bill the top rate of 33 percent would be 
cut to 196 percent until 1992 when it would be raised to 28

a bill carrying approval of a unanimous senate 
would allow retirees to keep medicare catastrophic insurance for 
nearly unlimited hospital charges while repealing a surtax that has 
threatened the entire program 
senior citizens will rest a little easier tonight knowing 
that this body has acted in a sensible fashion said sen john 
mccain rariz author of the bill to salvage parts of the program 
but wipe out the surtax 
under the bill that cleared the senate on a 990 vote friday 
night medicare recipients would lose protection against 
catastrophic physicians fees due to take effect next year and 
coverage for prescription drugs that would have been available 
starting in 1991 
the senate vote set up a confrontation with the house which 
voted 36066 earlier in the week to repeal the program lock 
stock and especially surtax negotiators will have to work out a 
compromise 
that may not be easy while the house favored repeal by a nearly 
61 margin senators rejected repeal on a 7326 vote a margin of 
almost 31 
catastrophic coverage was enacted a year ago to help prevent a 
serious illness from wiping out the finances of a retiree the 
program builds on medicare 
almost as quickly as it became law with solid bipartisan 
support the program came under fire from some of the very people 
it was designed to help 
lawmakers say most of the complaints came from two groups of 
retirees those who already have coverage and those higherincome 
people who must pay the surtax that finances twothirds of the 
program 
the surtax is paid only by the 40 percent of retirees whose 
incomes are high enough that they pay more than 150 federal income 
tax the surtax is 15 percent of the tax liability up to a maximum 
of 800 this year per retiree 
mccains bill would wipe out the surtax entirely what is left 
of the program would be financed by continuing the flat 4amonth 
premium that is paid by all but the poorest retirees the premium 
is scheduled to rise gradually to 1020 a month by 1993 
should mccains amendment become law retirees would be left 
with these benefits 
coverage of unlimited hospital charges after paying the first 
560 a year 
existing medicare coverage of doctors fees 80 percent 
reimbursement after the patient pays the first 75 each year 
nursinghome benefits for up to 100 days for each spell of 
illness after the patient spends at least three days in a 
hospital the patient would have to share expenses for 80 days 
up to 38 days of home health care per year 
miscellaneous coverage including a provision to prevent 
impoverishment of a spouse because of high medical bills unlimited 
hospice stays limited mammography and government payment of the 
monthly premium for the poor 
republican sens william roth of delaware and john c danforth 
of missouri who tried to repeal the program said the elderly 
would be better off giving up those limited benefits and the 
government starting from scratch with a new national health policy 
we promised too much we taxed too much but lets not throw 
it all out said republican leader bob dole of kansas adding 
that would leave many lowincome retirees with no insurance against 
costs of an expensive illness and no way to buy it 
earlier the senate turned thumbsdown on a leadershipbacked 
plan that would have preserved most benefits as well as part of the 
surtax 
that 6237 vote rejected an amendment by sen david durenberger 
rminn to retain almost total reimbursement for hospital charges 
and after the patient pays the first 1780 a year all doctors 
fees coverage for prescription drugs would have been eliminated 
hospital costs are rising by 5 percent a year doctors fees by 
15 percent durenberger said 
that is the catastrophe waiting to happen to elderly 
americans he said 
the senate rejected four other attempts to modify the 
catastrophic program including an amendment by sens carl levin 
dmich and tom harkin diowa that would have repealed the 
surtax kept the full benefits and raised income taxes on the 
nations 600000 wealthiest taxpayers to finance the program 
sen spark matsunaga dhawaii was the only member not voting 
on either repeal or the mccain bill

nasa says a nuclearpowered probe to be 
launched from the space shuttle atlantis next week does not pose a 
threat and would have withstood the challenger explosion without 
releasing deadly plutonium 
this important mission can be undertaken safely the 
national aeronautics and space administration said friday in answer 
to a lawsuit seeking to stop the oct 12 launch 
the florida coalition for peace and justice and other 
organizations opposed to the launch are trying to spread a tale of 
horrors but there is no evidence that these horrors will in fact 
or are likely to occur nasa told us district judge oliver 
gasch in a brief 
gasch has scheduled oral arguments for tuesday two days before 
atlantis is to lift off from kennedy space center carrying into 
orbit a probe called galileo 
the probe has two 247pound radioisotope thermoelectric 
generators known as rtgs that create electricity for the long 
journey they are similar to those that powered the voyager probe 
as it swept past neptune recently 
the florida group claims danger of plutonium contamination from 
a shuttle disaster is far greater than the government has admitted 
but nasa said engineers determined that if the galileo 
spacecraft its rtgs and its attached booster rocket had been 
aboard the challenger in 1986 no plutonium would have been 
released as a result of the accident 
nasa has spent 15 billion and expects to pay 400 million 
more on the project which will culminate in six years when the 
craft begins orbiting jupiter 
in essence plaintiffs do not like the launch decision and are 
trying to get the court to secondguess the executive branch of the 
government with regard to the acceptability of risk said the 
brief filed by justice department lawyer stuart b schoenburg 
opponents warned that the possibilities of an accident and a 
deadly plutonium release from galileo are 1in350 
nasa countered that exhaustive environmental impact studies 
showed the most probable accident statistically would be failure of 
the rocket that will propel the probe after it is released from the 
shuttle cargo bay 
even if the two thermonuclear power plants reentered earths 
atmosphere broke apart on hard rock and released plutonium there 
would be no additional cancer deaths over a 70year period nasa 
said 
studies showed that even in this worst case according to the 
agency the an individual have only a 1in100 million chance of 
being hurt 
the space probes journey to jupiter will be a complicated one 
involving one slingshot orbit of venus and two of earth to gain 
momentum nasa said the highest potential for human harm would be 
if the craft crashed through the atmosphere when it makes its close 
approach to earth the chances of that happening are 5in10 
million the brief said 
under this maximum case scenario there is a 1in10 million 
probability of 94 excess cancer fatalities worldwide over a 
70year period nasa said and the average individual risk would 
be 1in25 billion 
the space agency plans to begin the countdown monday as 
scheduled

gov henry bellmon was not amused by his 
states absence from rand mcnallys newly published world atlas 
which also left out north and south dakota 
we are mystified bellmon said in a letter to rand mcnally 
did you intend an insult or are you trying to say that oklahoma 
is so wellknown that travelers need no map to get here the latter 
seems more likely 
the letter was signed by the 33 million citizens of the great 
state of oklahoma bellmon spokesman sam armstrong said friday 
rand mcnally officials said space limitations forced the 
ommissions of the three states from the atlas which features 
colorful photographs of various regions of the world but one 
spokeswoman acknowledged the company may have blundered 
the 3495 rand mcnally photographic world atlas goes on sale 
this month north dakota tourism director jim fuglie however said 
he wasnt particularly miffed by the ommission 
its not like we missed the road atlas fuglie said if 
this was a book designed to reach the markets that we seek 
tourists from i would be very concerned 
fuglie said the publications managing editor told him 30000 
copies of the book are to be published 
the atlas breaks the united states down into seven regions 
photos from those regions are included and accompanying maps show 
at least a portion of 47 states 
they did include several regions of the united states and 
their portfolios just kind of touching upon various places said 
bonnie ryan a rand mcnally spokeswoman 
ryan said the omission was not intended as a deliberate affront 
to the three states 
in any case i have been told that when they go back to print 
next year theyre planning changes which include adding more maps 
to the us she said

the government is paying millions of dollars a 
year in excessive housing subsidies because of errors in the way it 
sets rents for the projects hud auditors say 
the auditors said in a report obtained friday that overpayments 
by the department of housing and urban development could be as high 
as 391 million for just the tiny sample of rent areas studied 
they said they couldnt project their findings to estimate 
potential nationwide overpayments because the sites selected for 
the audit were not chosen randomly but the report urged department 
officials to revisit the formula and to give huds regional 
economists a greater role in setting rents 
a second audit sent to congress this week raises fresh charges 
of favoritism in awarding rent subsidies and says such conduct was 
allowed because of poor program accountability mismanagement and 
political favoritism are the key subjects of congressional 
investigations of hud during the reagan administration 
for the rent study huds inspector general reviewed 142 of the 
2755 areas for which the department sets fairmarket rents for 
subsidized housing the report said that in 116 of those areas the 
government was paying 391 million a year in excessive subsidies 
in a smattering of areas the auditors said hud might be paying 
too little 
increased efforts need to be made by hud to ensure that the 
departments fairmarket rents realistically reflect prevailing 
local market rents the auditors said 
asked to comment hud issued a statement saying while we have 
every confidence in the way the fair market rents are computed we 
welcome the suggestions from the inspector generals office and 
want to work diligently with them to ensure that the system is 
working properly 
the rents which ultimately determine the amount of subsidies 
hud pays are calculated through a formula that is supposed to 
arrive at rents that are in line with similar nonsubsidized 
apartments in the area with the government rents perhaps slightly 
higher to cover any rehabilitation costs 
but the auditors said in some areas the fairmarket rents set by 
hud are well above local market rents for example for all of 
huds region x alaska washington oregon and idaho 
overpayments were estimated between 129 million and 146 million 
a year 
the second audit which dealt with the section 8 program found 
that hud did not advertise the availability of reserve funding at 
the control of agency headquarters and that some of the subsidies 
appeared to have been steered to specific housing agency and 
developers 
the auditors also said there was no documentation to support 
seven subsidy awards part of an overall problem of poor selection 
guidelines and accountability 
we believe that a commitment of federal funds of this 
magnitude should require more than an informal process ie 
documentation criteria and rationale for the decisions the 
auditors wrote in the report which was requested by the house 
banking committee 
the audit said 279 million was allocated from the reserve funds 
for fiscal 1988 and 1989 and laid blame for the questionable 
selection process on thomas demery the former hud assistant 
secretary for housing 
demery in comments included in the audit said there had been 
no formal system for awarding the money for more than a decade and 
that he sought input from huds regional administrators before 
making funding decisions 
the new administration at hud accepted the findings of that 
audit without exception and has established written application 
guidelines and ranking criteria for the program

armed men burst into a radio station 
that had broadcast a rebel communique against gen manuel antonio 
noriega a noriega supporter has offered 250000 to kill six of 
the generals enemies 
a letter published friday in the government newspaper critica 
said an unidentified businessman who made the offer presented the 
letter to a columnist it could not be confirmed 
they opponents have allowed a price to be put on noriegas 
head with dollars given to them by the united states the letter 
said therefore we consider it justified to use our money to pay 
those who execute traitors 
the six people threatened included former president eric 
delvalle who tried to fire noriega last year and was dismissed 
and col roberto diaz herrera a former top commander who was among 
the first to accuse noriega of drug trafficking 
we have international contacts and there will be no difficulty 
in carrying out these sworn duties said the letter addressed to 
columnist balatazar renan aizprua who also is chief spokesman for 
the state power authority 
it said the nationalist businessman deposited the money in a 
swiss bank account it did not elaborate 
armed men in civilian clothes invaded a radio station friday 
that broadcast a rebel communique against noriega during tuesdays 
botched coup they destroyed broadcast equipment and forced 
employees to leave 
threats to noriegas enemies and the attack on the radio station 
came after the general who blames the coup on the united states 
said he would get tough with opponents in a speech thursday 
noriega said radio stations that were bought off would be 
torn down 
in washington president bush defended his handling of the coup 
attempt saying there was no opportunity to seize noriega and that 
use of us force wasnt warranted under the existing 
circumstances 
bush said he would not rule out any option in a future coup 
attempt including military intervention 
the six people threatened in the letter to critica include 
former president eric delvalle who tried to fire noriega last year 
and was dismissed and col roberto diaz herrera a former top 
commander who was among the first to accuse noriega of drug 
trafficking 
opposition leader guillermo endara continued a hunger strike 
from the shelter of the papal nuncios residence a day after he was 
beaten and thrown out of his office by noriegas soldiers 
endaras doctors examined him friday and said he was in good 
condition but could not talk to the press he was in the 17th day 
of a hunger strike to promote an opposition campaign against the 
government 
endara launched his hunger strike as part of a campaign to 
encourage panamanians to delay tax payments and boycott government 
lotteries and casinos 
on television speech thursday noriega ridiculed endaras hunger 
strike and said he had evidence the united states had planned to 
install endara as president 
endara was presidential candidate for an opposition coalition in 
elections may 7 international observers said endaras ticket beat 
noriegas candidate by a 31 margin but noriega had the election 
annulled and appointed a provisional president 
noriega dominates panama through his command of its police and 
military and the united states has been trying to oust him since 
he was indicted on us drug trafficking charges in february 1988 
noriega says the united states is trying to disavow treaties 
that give his country control of the panama canal at the turn of 
the century he has withstood us economic sanctions elections 
and two failed coups 
in addition to delvalle and diaz herrera the businessmens 
letter threatened juan b sosa a former ambassador to the united 
states and gabriel lewis galindo jose isabel blandon and alberto 
garcia de paredes all opponents of noriega in exile

journalists since the failed rebellion of a military unit tuesday 
soldiers wielding sticks and rubbers hoses thursday night 
attacked journalists gathered in front of the building where 
oppositon leader guillermo endara was conducting a hunger strike 
endara was beaten and forced to leave the building 
military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega last year accused 
foreign correspondents of being disinformers and blamed them 
for the panamanian governments bad image abroad 
since then it has not been unusual for international 
journalists to be detained for hours at a time or to have film and 
cameras confiscated without explanation

correspondents of being on the us state departments payroll 
it is worse for the national press of the four main newspapers 
in panama city three are governmentowned the director of the 
only independently owned newspaper la estrella is a friend of 
noriegas 
the danger of running afoul of the regime was demonstrated by 
the fate of radio exitosa the only radio station to broadcast a 
rebel communique during tuesdays botched coup 
on thursday noriega said the united states had bought the 
coup attempt and that radio stations in the pay of the us 
government should be destroyed on friday the station was raided 
the employees driven off and its equipment destroyed 
i try to keep a low profile said a panamanian reporter who 
works for another station 
freedom of expression has suffered a big setback in panama 
this year manuel jimenez the president of the interamerican 
press association said friday in monterrey mexico he did not

wielding guns and rubber hoses dispersed everyone in front of the 
building where endara was conducting his hunger strike 
when journalists approached to ask questions the men pushed them

floor at 400 miles an hour pops up to 1000 feet then dives down 
on a speck of a target 
the pilot has to concentrate on the degree of the dive the 
location of the target the speed of his plane wind and other 
factors 
while focused on the target and the precise second to press the 
button whose nickname is part of the arcane jargon of the flight 
world the pilot must also fly stable so the radar can get an 
accurate look at the target williams explained 
a pilots concentration on his target can prove deadly 
weve had cases of pilots flying the craft into the ground 
williams said the result of target fixation is often death 
while accidents are a hazard of military practice the 
8yearold competition has a perfect safety record 
weve never lost a crew member or an aircraft williams said 
as an f16 fighting falcon roared overhead banking sharply after 
dropping a bomb on a target half a mile away 
the biennial exercise at nellis draws the cream of the countrys 
air force pilots and crews who have won regional competition at 
us bases around the world 
this years competitors include teams from germany japan the 
philippines and the united kingdom as well as us bases 
the dummy bombs provide only a flash of fire and a puff of 
smoke leaving the target an aging tank charred but reusable 
the real thing would be a different story 
a 500pound bomb would scatter fragmentation for 3000 feet 
williams said it would have a good kill radius of 300 feet 
on friday f16 units from mcentire air national guard base 
sc and hill air force base utah competed on the desert range 
along with a10s from bentwaters united kingdom 
after the bombing competition the planes swept back through the 
valley zeroing in on 25foot square cloth targets strung across 
the desert floor 
the valley echoed with the earpiercing chatter of the 20mm and 
30mm shells as pilots sqeezed off bursts of gunfire from cannons 
that fire 4200 rounds a minute 
pilots fly seven days during the twoweek event which ends oct 
14 and includes competitions among teams who load the weapons and 
maintain the planes 
there is even a competition to see which pilot lands closest to 
his designated arrival time at nellis six flights arrived within 
one second of their designated time on oct 1

a new study weakens the evidence linking 
manicdepressive illness to a genetic defect as proposed in a 
widely reported 1987 paper says a scientist who participated in 
both studies 
although the evidence remains suggestive its not up to the 
accepted or the conventional level of significance that has been 
used in these kinds of studies said david pauls 
the original study had been hailed as the first to show a 
genetic defect in a psychiatric illness that includes no physical 
abnormalities in the brain 
but with the new data researchers are not nearly as confident 
as we were that they had found the approximate location of such a 
gene said pauls of the yale university school of medicine 
i guess the conclusion is that the evidence isnt nearly as 
strong and additional work needs to be done so that we can either 
definitely rule in or rule out the finding he said 
the new work was reported recently at a scientific meeting 
coauthors included several researchers who wrote the 1987 paper 
and other scientists 
genes lie along tiny threadlike structures called chromosomes 
that are found in cells of the body the 1987 paper presented 
evidence that a gene causing manicdepressive illness in three 
generations of a large amish family lay somewhere within a part of 
the chromosome numbered 11 
the new work suggests that either there is also a second gene 
for the disease in the amish or that the originally reported gene 
does not exist pauls said 
the illness also called bipolar disorder is estimated to 
affect about one out of every 100 americans at some time in their 
lives 
generally it involves severe depression plus episodes of mania 
which can include restlessness racing thoughts and delusions of 
grandeur or of hypomania a less intense form of mania symptoms 
can be largely controlled with drugs 
soon after the 1987 paper was published other researchers 
announced that a different group of people showed evidence of a 
gene for manicdepressive illness on the chromosome designated x 
scientists said it supported the idea that more than one gene can 
cause the disorder 
pauls said that more work has been done on the x chromosome 
finding since and it still looks quite convincing 
the original amish research involved genetic testing of 19 
family members who had manicdepressive illness or a related 
condition plus 62 family members without psychiatric illness 
scientists traced the inheritance of genetic markers which are 
detectable signposts on chromosomes statistical analysis comparing 
marker inheritance to the appearance of the disease in a family 
tree can reveal the location of diseasecausing genes that lie near 
the markers 
since the original work was done pauls said in a recent 
interview scientists have added some 40 people to the analysis 
and two people in the original group who had been diseasefree 
developed manicdepressive disorder 
when the statistical analysis was performed again to include the 
new information the evidence for the reported manicdepressive 
gene became considerably weaker pauls said

some people suggested it was a waste of 
time and not even the organizers of a contest to identify animal 
droppings could deny that waste was involved 
the competition thursday provided a lighthearted sendoff to 
more than 250 people who attended the american zookeeper 
associations yearly conference this week 
bewing able to identify feces has its practical uses said 
tom labarge curator of carnivores for syracuses burnet park you 
can tell a lot about an animal by analyzying its feces its 
usually the first indication if something is wrong 
the specimens in plastic bags were laid out on several 
tables to be identified by sight alone 
there were brief hints in many cases but no 20 a single 
dropping the size of a coconut simply said no clue needed 
everyone answered elephant correctly 
nearly everyone was stumped by the feces of the sea cucumber a 
primitive invertebrate the clue was not something youd put in 
a salad 
frank kohn of the national zoo in washington dc was a bit 
bemused by the hoopla 
i never see the stuff in plastic bags and we never get 
clues kohn said we just scoop it up

proposals to encourage election of black 
judges and boost the gasoline tax to finance highway construction 
lead a list of state and local ballot questions before voters today 
secretary of state fox mckeithen predicted that 33 to 35 percent 
of the states registered voters would go to the polls 
there was little organized opposition to any of the 13 proposed 
amendments to the state constitution and the transportation 
measure drew the most statewide interest 
the measure mirrored a proposal rejected by the voters april 29 
when it was put forth by gov buddy roemer as part of a tax 
revision plan 
it would raise the gasoline tax by 4 cents per gallon to finance 
14 billion in transportation work including widening highways 
and expanding ports and airports the measure also would require 
that all 16 cents per gallon of the present motor fuel tax be used 
for highways and public works projects 
roemer said the plan would boost efforts to attract new industry 
to louisiana and create thousands of construction jobs 
i wont beat it to death but it will be a powerful positive 
step forward for louisiana and its taxpayers the governor said 
two proposed amendments to the procedure for electing state 
judges stem from federal lawsuits that contend that voting 
districts are drawn to dilute black voting strength 
there are no blacks on louisianas sevenmember supreme court 
one black among the states 52 appellate court judges and five 
black district court judges out of 192 
one amendment would add a judicial election district with a 
majority of blacks in the new orleans area and temporarily add a 
justice to the state supreme court until the displaced incumbent 
finishes out his term 
another amendment would create up to 35 blackmajority 
subdistricts for district and appellate courts 
among the other proposed constitutional amendments were one that 
would make it easier for police to confiscate the property of 
suspected drug dealers and another to set aside at least 5 million 
a year in state mineral revenue to restore eroding wetlands 
several taxrelated amendments were on the ballot including 
measures to raise the automobile license plate fee to allow cities 
and towns to raise property taxes and to extend from five years to 
10 years the current property tax assessment freeze for owners who 
expand or improve buildings in certain districts

an aging america will pose new 
challenges for business health care and entertainment just as 
baby boomers transformed society as they grew to adulthood a 
census bureau official says 
baby boomers the 75 million people born in the 20 years after 
world war ii swamped schools and later colleges as they grew up 
forcing big investments in classrooms flooded the job market 
adding to pressures that increased the unemployment rate and 
dramatically transformed a nations tastes in music and 
entertainment said james wetzel chief of the census bureaus 
center for demographic studies 
as they grow older their motivation is changing he said friday 
during a symposium on the future at the associated press managing 
editors convention 
theyre not as concerned about rock stars or college 
admissions as they were just 10 years ago wetzel said the 
baby boom generation is into careers theyre moving from sporty 
little japanese cars to minivans theyre concerned with home 
ownership and child care 
he said the new buzz word is cocooning 
loosely translated the baby boom generation is not so fond of 
hanging around discos any more theyre staying home with a 2 
video and a 9 pizza 
some of those changes represent the kind of forces that shape 
nations 
the aging of the population has a powerful down side he 
said the young adult population the population which provides 
important impetus for social change and economic change is 
declining 
the number of americans ages 1525 peaked at about 43 million in 
1980 and already has dropped by about 7 million he said between 
1990 and 2000 he said about 7 million to 8 million fewer people 
will be in the 2535 age group 
another rapidly growing segment of the population comprises 
those older than 85 
wetzel said the health care financing administration projects a 
need for 400000 nursing home beds nationwide between 1990 and 
2000 or 100 beds a day for the remainder of the century 
he said that barring catastrophes such as war or plague the 
median american will be 36 by the year 2000 compared with under 28 
in 1970 and 33 today median means half are younger and half are 
older 
the wave of older americans will challenge the hierarchy of 
industry he said 
among those challenges is a large increase in the number of 
people looking for promotions to management that far outstrips the 
positions available 
another challenge is recruiting entry level workers from a 
shrinking pool of available workers 
by the late 1990s the supply of college graduates may be 10 
percent smaller than the average pool available in the 1980s 
wetzel said 
he also discussed the massive shift of married women especially 
those with children into the job market more than six of 10 wives 
are in the work force double the proportion of 1950 more than 
half of the nations mothers are in the work force and slightly 
more than half of all the mothers of children below the age of 1 
are working he said 
the population trends also provide evidence of an america in 
which young people remain single longer and where more families are 
headed by a single adult 
about 56 percent of the nations households have married 
couples down from 75 percent in the 1960s he said 
since 1970 the number of households with married couples and 
children has dropped 35 percent 
and in the last 20 years the number of people living alone has 
increased from 9 million to 21 million and the number of households 
headed by a single person has more than doubled to 13 million

a news industry far too eager to grab 
the easy story has helped trivialize the nations political life 
house majority whip william h gray told newspaper editors 
ill be very candid with you said gray eleven years ago 
when i went to congress there were more press people who 
understood what budget authority and outlays meant 
now you get people writing stories about budget policy who 
dont even know what a budget outlay and a budget authority is 
therefore what they focus on is the superficial political 
categorizations and charges 
gray a pennsylvania democrat made his comments at a convention 
of the associated press managing editors he said an increasing 
focus on the easy story has contributed to the trivialization 
of american politics 
gray last spring had his own brush with the press just before 
his election to a house leadership post news reports citing 
unnamed sources said he was the target of an fbi investigation 
about his office personnel policies 
those reports were later denied but gray said they were 
symbolic of the more recent infatuation with the personal lives 
of politicians 
am i advocating an end to public scrutiny by no means he 
said what i would recommend is greater selfcontrol 
since there can be no allencompassing definition of what 
constitutes news likewise there should be no predisposition that 
all things involving public officials is news 
grays brush with controversy was among several involving ethics 
in congress one of which led to the resignation of former speaker 
jim wright 
congress is likely to approve a new ethics code this fall gray 
said 
but theres a deeper problem he added 
the biggest problem i have as i look at the press in general 
in washington is a tendency to go for what i call the superficial 
the easy story where you can get into simple headlines simple 
bites said gray im often terribly disappointed by that 
it makes all of us in washington look like a bunch of naughty 
kids calling each other names 
gray said the focus on superficial events has a domino effect 
making politicians fit that style of coverage 
even more serious is the more recent infatuation with the 
personal lives of public officials he said this preoccupation 
is not a result of the trivialization of american politics it is a 
contributing factor

two burmese students who hijacked a 
jetliner in an effort to gain democracy for their militaryruled 
homeland surrendered today and a thai official indicated they 
would be treated leniently 
the students seized control of the fokker 28 during a domestic 
flight in burma friday and ordered it flown to bangkok they then 
threatened to blow up the craft and the 83 others aboard if their 
demands for democracy were not met 
but after 10 hours of negotiations with thai and burmese 
officials the hostages were freed unharmed and the students gave 
themselves up 
i think really now it is a matter of looking at the details of 
the negotiations and the conditions for the surrender said a 
senior thai official on condition of anonymity 
another thai official indicated the students would probably be 
treated leniently 
we think they are students and not professional terrorists 
he said on condition of anonymity 
although thailand has nurtured friendly relations with burma it 
does not have a formal extradition treaty with that country the 
thai official said it was possible the students would be sent to a 
third country 
thirtyfive hostages were released late friday and the remaining 
48 passengers and crew were allowed to leave early today aung gyi 
a burmese embassy official said the passengers would be sent back 
to burma today 
a thai official later entered the empty plane and emerged 
carrying a box he said contained a bomb 
the hijackers had demanded the release of political prisoners 
an end to military rule and the restoration of democracy in burma 
but thailands deputy government spokesman likit hongladarom 
said the hijackers identified as ye yin and ye thi ha simply 
wanted their demands known and published by the press they had 
probably not expected the rangoon government would act on them he 
said 
slogans were scribbled with a felt pen on the inside and outside 
of the aircraft recalling last years military crackdown on the 
studentled uprising in burma 
democracy and human rights for our people and our heads 
are bloody but unbowed the slogans read 
the names of the hijackers which translate as brave and 
lion respectively appeared to be pseudonyms 
a statement they gave to a reporter was signed ye thon baw 
which literally means the three brave comrades it was not 
however clear who the third person was 
the official burmese news agency said the plane was hijacked 
between mergui in southern burma and rangoon the capital then 
diverted at gunpoint to thailand the fokker landed in utaphao a 
sprawling military base southeast of bangkok used by us b52 
bombers during the vietnam war 
the hijackers then handed thai authorities a list of seven 
demands which included the release of top opposition leader aung 
san suu kyi an end to the militaryimposed curfew and restoration 
of democracy in burma 
ms suu kyi was placed under house arrest on july 20 after 
speaking out against the military government her national league 
for democracy is burmas largest opposition party in burma 
thousands of students fled the 1988 uprising and another 
clampdown on opposition this year many took refuge with ethnic 
rebel groups that have fought the rangoon government for 40 years 
for greater autonomy 
thaung htun a spokesman for the all burma students democratic 
front said his group had no part in the hijacking but said we 
have sympathy and understanding with their actions

china today expressed utmost regret and 
indignation over the awarding of the nobel peace prize to the 
dalai lama saying the tibetan spiritual leader is working to 
undermine the national unity of the country 
the foreign ministry reaction came two days after the nobel 
committee announced the winner of the prize and a day after chinas 
official xinhua news agency condemned the choice 
the decision taken by the norwegian nobel committee to award 
the nobel peace prize to the dalai lama constitutes open support to 
the dalai lama and the tibetan separatists in their activities to 
undermine the national unity and split china the ministry said 
it represents a gross interference in chinas internal affairs 
and seriously hurts the national feelings of the chinese people 
over this we express our utmost regret and indignation 
the ministry statement said the decision deviates from the 
committees purpose of awarding the prize to those working for and 
contributing to harmony and good will among peoples 
the nobel committee in giving the 54yearold buddhist monk the 
peace prize praised his dedication to nonviolence and great 
reverence for all things living 
china however blames the dalai lama and his followers for 
instigating at least four major outbreaks of antichinese 
proindependence violence in the tibetan capital of lhasa in the 
past two years 
the dalai lama has lived in exile in northern india since 
fleeing lhasa in 1959 following a failed uprising against the 
chinese army 
china says the remote mountain region of tibet has been an 
integral part of the nation since the 13th century 
many tibetans demand independence although the dalai lama last 
year offered a compromise proposal under which tibet would gain 
selfautonomy but cede control of its defense and foreign affairs 
to the beijing government 
china has rejected the proposal but says it is willing to meet 
the dalai lama to discuss the tibet question

east germans turned their attention to 
torchbearers and the charismatic mikhail s gorbachev and away from 
the thousands who fled westward shortly before the nations 40th 
anniversary festivities 
the soviet president was center stage friday as he visited east 
berlins war memorials and stood beside east german leader erich 
honecker as tens of thousands of east german youth paraded by 
he inspired cheers of gorby gorby from the crowd as he 
broke ranks to chat and walk among them during the carefully staged 
birthday celebrations friday 
but gorbachev joined with east bloc leaders and other friends of 
east berlin such as plo chief yasser arafat and nicarguan 
president daniel ortega for a lavish show of unity the twoday 
celebration ends today 
there has been little mention of the exodus of disgruntled east 
germans that has captured world attention 
communist authorities worked hard to keep the focus on east 
germanys economic successes and off the turmoil but hundreds more 
east germans fled friday to freedom in the west where at least 
47000 have found homes since early september 
police clashed with protesters in dresden and magdeburg and 
authorities barred western tourists from east berlin 
fridays anniversary events were capped by a parade in which 
tens of thousands marched down the citys main boulevard carrying 
flaming torches and chanting german democratic republic east 
germany our fatherland 
all of our energy and loyalty to the german democratic 
republic read one of the banners 
gorbachev and honecker waved and smiled to the crowd blazing 
beams of blue light cut into the night sky and laser images formed 
doves of peace 
earlier gorbachev visited two war memorials and at one walked 
along columns etched with the words of josef stalin a soviet 
predecessor whose course he has condemned 
the soviet leader was greeted along the motorcade route by 
throngs of wellwishers there were signs that east germans hoped 
gorbachevs reform effort would penetrate the east berlin 
government which has rejected radical change 
hes trying to do a lot said one young woman 
the official message however presented the orthodox communist 
line periodicals prepared for the event contrasted world war ii 
east germany with the modern rebuilt country today indeed the 
country is in the best shape economically of the warsaw pact allies 
east germany has achieved through the courage and brilliance 
and energy of its people a life with more dignity and meaning

las vegas a drug pipeline that ended in a los angeles 
warehouse apparently pumped 60 tons of cocaine into southern 
california and returned some 80 million to traffickers in the past 
year a federal prosecutor said 
meanwhile a sworn statement unsealed friday alleges that rafael 
munoz of juarez mexico was the middleman who provided 
transportation and storage for loads of cocaine coming from 
colombia via mexico to the united states 
munoz who remains at large is considered a premier importer of 
multiton quantities of narcotics into the united states the los 
angeles times reported in todays editions 
court records in the case were unsealed at a bail hearing for 
two men charged in connection with a sept 29 raid that netted 
about 19 tons of cocaine and 122 million in cash the biggest 
cocaine seizure ever 
information about the smuggling operation was provided by james 
mctague 41 the alleged supervisor of the warehouse cache in 
sylmar in suburban los angeles for about a year assistant us 
attorney tom green said 
he indicated that since he had been in charge they had moved 
60 tons of cocaine through the warehouse green said the 
ledgers showed that 80 million cash had gone through his hands 
since hed been involved 
mctague was among four other men also arrested in the case the 
los angeles district attorneys office dismissed charges against 
them friday so federal charges carrying significantly sticter 
penalties could be pursued 
los angelesbased special assistant us attorney susan bryant 
said she expected the case to go before a grand jury next week 
the men were being held without bail in los angeles for 
investigation of conspiracy and drug trafficking 
on thursday narcotics agents announced more cocaine seizures 
almost as big almost 15 tons confiscated in separate raids in 
harlingen texas and new orleans 
almost 9 tons found in a threebedroom home in harlingen was 
bound for los angeles authorities said but it apparently was 
unrelated to the drug seizure in sylmar 
the staggering amount of cocaine seized almost 34 tons in less 
than a week led us transportation secretary samuel k skinner 
to speculate that colombias crackdown on drugs was forcing drug 
cartels to move vast quantities of coke quickly into the united 
states 
drug cartels used to keep large stockpiles of cocaine in 
colombia and move it gradually to the united states skinner said 
in new orleans thursday but theyre now moving it in huge lots 
thats because of the pressure from the government in 
colombia he said 
but on friday drug czar william j bennetts office ordered an 
urgent review to determine if us estimates of cocaine production 
have been vastly understated the times reported 
according to us estimates the 34 tons confiscated represents 
about 8 percent of the cartels maximum annual production of 400 
tons 
the most likely scenario is that theres a hell of a lot more 
cocaine in the united states than people thought before one 
unnamed senior administration official told the newspaper 
evidence seized in the sylmar warehouse have laid bare the inner 
workings of a major trafficking operation and federal officials 
said it may help them follow drug money to legitimate businesses 
and banks where it is laundered 
the disclosures came during an identity and bail hearing for 
carlos tapia ponce and his son hector tapia anchondo who 
authorities claim ran the us leg of the alleged smuggling 
operation 
the two men are being held without bail for investigation of 
conspiracy and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute 
us magistrate lawrence leavitt recessed the hearing without 
ruling on a request for bail by anchondo leavitt who was not 
asked to set bail for ponce said he would rule on the request 
later

most parents think handicapped children are 
faring better in school than a decade ago but only a third of 
classroom teachers say they feel confident in their dealings with 
the disabled according to a new poll 
the poll a report card on special education also found 
only 11 percent of parents and 15 percent of teachers and other 
educators saying schools are doing an excellent job preparing 
handicapped students for jobs after high school 
only 15 percent of parents and teachers surveyed thought public 
schools were doing an excellent job preparing the 44 million 
disabled children in special education programs for college or 
other education beyond high school 
and while 97 percent of handicapped students said they made 
friends at school 42 percent felt they were teased more often than 
other children 
nonetheless 94 percent of eof the education for all 
handicapped children act the federal law conferring most of the 
education rights such youngsters now have 
the survey of parents educators and disabled students was 
conducted by louis harris and associates for the international 
center for the disabled in new york and the national council on 
disability a copy was given to the associated press on friday 
both educators and parents are saying that schools are not 
preparing these students for college or jobs when you think about 
the state of education as bad as the quality of schooling is for 
nondisabled children to hear that its worse for the handicapped 
is pretty shocking said thomas mehnert assistant survey 
director for the disabled center 
nearly half of the regular classroom teachers surveyed said they 
have two or more handicapped students in their classes but just 40 
percent of those said they had training in special ed and only 32 
percent felt confident of their decisions affecting handicapped 
children 
a total of 702 special ed directors school principals regular 
and special ed classroom teachers were interviewed by telephone 
along with 1000 parents and 200 disabled students 
the survey had a sampling error ranging from plus or minus two 
percentage points on questions asked of everyone in the survey to 
plus or minus 14 on questions aimed at various subgroups 
fred weintraub executive director of the council for 
exceptional children in reston va and an architect of the 1975 
special education statute said the survey suggested an 
incredibly high happiness rate among those served by special ed 
but he added we have real shortages of welltrained special 
ed personnel and its going to get far worse if we dont do 
anything about it because of those shortages we are seeing all 
kinds of creative groupings of children for example programs 
designed for learning disabled kids forced to include emotionally 
disturbed kids so you have teachers with skills in one working 
with some of those kids but not others 
among the surveys other findings 
61 percent of parents said they knew little or nothing about 
their rights under key federal laws such as the 1973 rehabilitation 
act which gave students the right to a free appropriate 
education in the least restrictive environment 
over half the parents surveyed 56 percent said they had to 
struggle to get the education their children needed 36 percent 
said they had considered filing complaints against their schools 
and 10 percent said they had done so 
over 70 percent of parents gave positive marks to educators 
attitudes toward handicapped children physical access to school 
facilities and efforts by schools to integrate disabled and 
nonhandicapped children 
78 percent of handicapped students say they find their work 
interesting and 88 percent called their teachers helpful but 18 
percent of their parents said the quality of academic programs in 
their schools was worse for handicapped children

conservative premier tzannis tzannetakis 
today resigned saying his 3monthold rightistcommunist coalition 
government had completed its mission to begin a cleanup of greek 
politics 
the resignation set the stage for new general elections next 
month 
tzannetakis headed the coalition government that emerged from 
the june 18 general elections 
his new democracy party and the communistdominated coalition of 
the left and progress agreed to unite only to push premier andreas 
papandreous eightyear socialist administration out of power and 
launch an investigation of government corruption 
tzannetakis met with president christos sartzetakis at the 
presidential palace where he told him that his government had 
completed its mission of instigating a cleanup of greek politics 
a member of the premiers new democracy party said tzannetakis 
was asked by the president to remain until a new administration was 
formed 
but chances for a new government to be formed from the present 
parliament appeared extremely slim 
new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis and greek communist 
party chief harilaos florakis stated they would reject a 
presidential mandate to form a new cabinet 
however papandreou has said he would make an attempt to form a 
caretaker government 
presumably papandreou will attempt to persuade the communists to 
join him in an alliance supported by socialist and leftist forces 
papandreou 70 has been indicted by parliament twice within the 
past three weeks for allegedly instigating illegal wiretapping of 
political friends and foes and for his alleged involvement in a 
million dollar banking embezzlement scheme 
two special courts of supreme court judges are expected to 
convene within the next two months to start proceedings against 
papandreou and former socialist ministers and officials allegedly 
connected with the scandals 
papandreou and his exministers have denied any wrongdoing 
during their term in office

activists freed their 12 
hostages and ended a 28hour seige at the costa rican embassy to 
protest alleged human rights violations by the rightist government 
government spokesman mauricio sandoval called the embassy 
takeover an affront to the government and people of costa rica 
a violent action that makes no sense he alleged the groups 
activists had direct links to leftist guerrillas fighting 
salvadoran governments for 10 years 
some of the 20 members of the federation of committees of 
mothers and relatives of political prisoners who took part in the 
incident may be charged he said without elaboration 
the activists mostly mothers and other female relatives of 
people jailed or killed by rightwing death squads over the past 
decade released their hostages friday hostages and activists were 
taken away in six international red cross vehicles 
police would not let reporters talk to evacuees none of the 
hostages one costa rican diplomat and 11 salvadorans employed in 
the embassy appeared harmed 
sandoval said the hostages were taken to red cross headquarters 
in san salvador for medical checks before being sent home and the 
activists returned to their groups headquarters 
the government spokesman said the activists apparently left 
their weapons inside the offices or hidden because they 
boarded the red cross vehicles unarmed the activists had insisted 
they were not armed but costa rican diplomats said they carried 
weapons 
the activists arrived in small groups early thursday pretending 
to apply for visas then seized the embassy and took 16 hostages 
they later allowed ambassador jesus fernandez who had heart 
trouble and some employees to leave a spokeswoman for the 
activists who did not give her name told reporters earlier the 
hostagetaking was to protest alleged human rights violations by 
president alfredo cristianis rightist government which took power 
june 1 it also was to bring pressure for concrete measures to 
end the war 
for eight years the federation has protested the kidnappings 
and killings of people suspected of leftist sympathies by rightist 
death squads more than 70000 people have died in the decadeold 
war most of them civilians

at boeing co the worlds largest commercial airplane builder 
continued to obtain multibilliondollar orders 
with no talks scheduled in the walkout boeing officials 
announced an order friday from evergreen airways corp of taiwan 
for four 747400s and two extendedrange 767300ers plus options 
for equal numbers of the same models t craig martin of boeing 
commercial airplanes said the order including options eventually 
would be worth nearly 2 billion 
the planes were among 26 ordered by evergreen airways from 
boeing and mcdonnell douglas corp 
two planes were delivered friday a 757 to ansett worldwide 
leasing co of australia for eventual use by air belgium and a 
747400 to malaysia airlines another 747400 jumbo jet is set for 
delivery monday to qantas airways boeing officials said 
federal aviation administration officials said friday they were 
investigating reports that some supervisors cheated on the 
certification tests took so they could perform work normally done 
by union members who entered the fourth day of their strike today 
jack gamble of boeing commercial airplanes said he knew of no 
cheating on tests 
if the company was aware of it it certainly wouldnt allow 
it gamble added 
the striking international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers represents about 43300 workers in the seattle 
area about 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and 
several hundred others in hawaii california montana and utah 
i have heard from the union and they are interested in 
returning to the table but nothing is scheduled and i dont 
foresee anything this weekend federal mediator doug hammond said 
a strikers arm was broken when he was struck by a pickup truck 
thursday at the west gate of the 747 and 767 plant in everett said 
ken murray of the everett police

boeing union complained of some harassment from strikers 
charles bofferding president of the seattle professional 
engineering employees association the secondlargest union at 
boeing said in a letter that some of his 27000 members were 
meeting with resistance and mild harassment 
he urged his members to wear union identification and to refuse 
to do machinists work 
gamble said production was going very slowly with company 
officials still trying to match supervisors with assemblyline jobs 
the first few days are the toughest trying to find out who 
you have and what they know he said 
of the 93 planes scheduled for delivery between now and the end 
of the year about 40 were complete enough to be finished by 
supervisors gamble said 
before the strike boeing was running close to capacity 
producing about 30 planes a month 
the machinists went on striker wednesday after rejecting an 
offer that included an immediate raise of 4 percent with 3 percent 
raises in both 1990 and 1991 annual bonuses and a reduction in 
mandatory overtime

portauprince haiti ap four international human rights 
groups said there are persistent human rights violations in haiti 
and urged ruler lt gen prosper avril to stick to his promises of 
curbing abuses 
the delegation from americas watch the national coalition for 
haitian refugees caribbean rights and the international 
commission of jurists issued a statement friday after a weeklong 
investigation in the impoverished caribbean nation 
we dont believe that violence and arbitrariness will cease 
unless avrils government proves by its acts that it is firmly 
determined to put an end to them the groups said in a statement 
the delegation said it was worried about repeated acts of 
repression against grassroots organizations 
it denounced the absence of legal action taken against thugs and 
soldiers responsible for killings since dictator jeanclaude 
duvalier fled into exile in france in 1986 
the delegation said those killers must be tried to discourage 
a repetition of these tragic moments in haitian history 
the delegation said however the arrest of several soldiers for 
various crimes a new legal assistance program for the poor and 
publication of an electoral timetable were all positive steps 
avril has pledged to turn over power to a civilian government 
the independent electoral council has set elections for autumn 
1990 with the president to be sworn in on feb 7 1991 exactly 
five years after duvalier left 
elections can only have meaning if all haitian citizens are 
free to speak organize and assemble without fear of persecution 
the communique said 
the delegation said avril assured them that his government 
guaranteed the rights of speech and assembly 
he declared that the violation of these rights was the result 
of actions taken at the local level and that he had discharged 
those responsible the statement said

pulitzer prizewinner seymour m hersh said a 
federal jurys ruling that he didnt libel a former indian prime 
minister was a terribly important victory for any journalist 
jurors deliberated six hours friday before rejecting morarji 
desais claim that he was libeled when hersh described him as a cia 
informant in the 1983 book the price of power kissinger in the 
nixon white house 
the us district court jury found desai had failed to prove 
hersh was guilty of libel that is that he had knowingly printed 
false material with malice or with reckless disregard for whether 
it was true 
further the panel said desai had failed to disprove the claims 
about desais work for the cia which hersh testified came from a 
halfdozen highlevel government officials whom he refused to name 
desais lawyer cyriac d kappil had asked jurors to award 35 
million to his client prime minister of india from 1977 to 1979 
desai 94 lives in bombay and didnt attend the trial because of 
failing health 
the lawyer said he would confer with desai and fellow attorneys 
before deciding whether to appeal 
hersh said the verdict in the sixyearold case vindicated him 
and he described the case as a terribly important victory for any 
journalist 
i think its going to make it easier for all the people in my 
profession he said of the ruling nonetheless its also very 
chilling its also very frightening to realize that you can write 
things that can put you through a process like this 
the book said desai was paid 20000 a year by the cia and was 
considered a valuable asset to the us government during the 
administrations of lyndon johnson and richard nixon 
kappil alleged in his closing argument wednesday that hersh had 
fabricated notes to back up the assertions about desai 
defense attorney bernard j nussbaum countered that such 
behavior was entirely out of keeping with his career as a 
journalist 
hersh won the pulitzer prize for international reporting in 1970 
for his reports on the my lai massacre in vietnam he has reported 
for the associated press and the the new york times and left the 
newspaper to pursue his own writing 
former secretary of state henry kissinger testified earlier this 
week that he didnt believe desai was a cia informant but he 
acknowledged he couldnt be absolutely sure because he wasnt told 
the names of informants

exxon valdez captain joseph hazelwood 
will be tried outside valdez because of the publicity and local 
concern there over the nations worst oil spill prosecutors and 
defense attorneys said 
a new location for the trial set for january has not yet been 
decided 
hazelwood 42 of huntington ny faces three misdemeanor and 
three felony charges stemming from the march 24 accident 
the tanker was under hazelwoods command when it ran aground 
after he turned the controls over to the vessels third mate 
gregory cousins more than 11 million gallons of thick north slope 
crude oil spilled into the sea 
cousins was barred thursday from serving as an officer on any 
ship for nine months after he pleaded nocontest at a hearing in 
seattle to charges of negligence in monitoring the tankers 
position 
a coast guard report said that before leaving the bridge 
hazelwood talked with cousins about when to return to the vessel 
traffic lanes which the captain had left to avoid ice in prince 
william sound 
cousins failed to return to the normal course for several 
minutes after passing busby light where hazelwood had instructed 
him to turn the report said it quoted cousins as saying he 
ordered the appropriate change in course but the ship failed to 
respond 
defense lawyers richard friedman and dick madson have sought to 
move hazelwoods trial out of valdez and assistant district 
attorney brent cole said the state supports the move 
because of the large amount of pretrial publicity and the 
large economic impact on valdez we just agreed in the interests 
of expeditious proceedings to not got through the hassle of trying 
to get a jury in valdez cole said 
cole said he has asked that the trial be held in anchorage but 
friedman said he was unsure that would be a good choice i think

barbara bush paid a visit to a teen nightspot 
giving hundreds of students a break from school and a chance to 
hear her praise for good clean fun 
mrs bush made a brief friday afternoon stop at the basement an 
alcoholfree nightclub established last year by parents who wanted 
to give teenagers a safe place to go to on weekend nights 
the club was closed this summer after six months because of poor 
attendance but it is scheduled to reopen at the end of the month 
with live entertainment movies and a game room 
students from several area schools were allowed to leave their 
classes to accompany mrs bush to the basement 
i cant wait to go back and tell george she said from a 
stage where rock n roll bands usually play 
i cant think of anything that meets the needs of our times 
better than this she said 
though mrs bush got an enthusiastic reception during her 
appearance some of the students in the crowd said the main reason 
they were at the basement was because the event got them out of 
school on a beautiful fall afternoon 
cason white a 12thgrader at pace academy said he rarely came 
to the basement noting the regular 5 admission charge its 
kind of expensive and out of the way he said he and his friends 
said theyd rather go to parties 
the atmosphere at the basement said classmate jeffrey cohen 
seems so paranoid it turns kids off 
anne landis a spokeswoman for the club said organizers are 
hoping that changes made during the summer will make the basement 
more appealing to teenagers the club is striving to make the 
adult supervision less conspicuous she said 
we dont want kids to think its too straightlaced ms 
landis said 
earlier friday mrs bush told a convocation at the morehouse 
school of medicine that the predominantly black college had made 
her optimistic the nations poor will receive better health care 
mrs bush is a former board member at the medical school 
founded by health and human services secretary dr louis w 
sullivan its mission is to provide doctors for poor mainly 
innercity areas 
she noted that the schools student body is growing rapidly it 
has a 95 percent passing rate on national board tests and has never 
experienced an operating budget deficit 
im not naive enough to think the graduates of morehouse will 
solve all the health problems but im optimistic mrs bush

pope john paul ii opened an asian 
pilgrimage today by urging koreans to end the bitter ideological 
struggle that has divided their land and to reach out in peace to 
communist north korea 
about 1000 antigovernment dissidents staged a peaceful protest 
at a seoul college campus to urge the pope to speak out on alleged 
human rights abuses in south korea some 1000 riot police 
surrounded the campus but made no move to halt the protest 
john paul arrived in seoul after flying across the soviet union 
for the first time and sending greetings by radio to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in a sign of recently improved 
vaticansoviet relations the pope expressed hope he would soon 
visit moscow 
after being greeted with a bugle and drum fanfare by 
scarletclad bandsman and young women in traditional silk dresses 
waving white and yellow papal flags the pope immediately took up 
the issue of korean reunification that has divided the influential 
catholic community in south korea 
addressing himself to the dear people of korea john paul 
said 
in the face of the tragic division which continues to separate 
your own people do you not have the urgent mission to prove to a 
world torn by mistrust strife and hatred that mankind does have 
the resources to end division and war and to forge an enduring 
peace 
those resources are yours the spiritual values of mutual 
trust and reconciliation of selfless generosity and brotherly 
love he said 
the korean peninsula divided in 1945 is the site of one of the 
worlds most bitter ideological confrontations with the capitalist 
south locked in a struggle for domination with the totalitarian 
north the two sides who fought to a bloody stalemate in the 
195053 korean war frequently clash and maintain huge armies along 
their narrow 150mile border 
north and south korea are still technically at war since no 
peace treaty was signed at the end of the korean war in 1953 
you yourselves are witnesses of the painful divisions that 
affect your own people he said you are searching for a 
solution 
a heated debate broke out in the catholic community after a 
dissident priest visited north korea in july to escort home a 
radical college student the two claimed the trip was to promote 
unification but the seoul government called it an illegal contact 
with an enemy state 
the priest and student were arrested when they crossed back 
across the border three other priests were jailed for organizing 
the priests trip without government approval 
security was extremely tight today with hundreds of police and 
security agents guarding the pope worshipers attending a mass 
given by the pope at a seoul church had to pass through metal 
detectors and other searches and police guarded surrounding streets 
the dissidents who held a peaceful protest at sogang university 
urged the pope to denounce the government of president roh taewoo 
for what they said were human rights abuses protesters applauded 
as a student leader said the governments claims to have introduced 
democracy were false 
but most south koreans agree there have been major political 
reforms and the dissidents have little public support 
in later remarks during a mass in a gymnastics hall where the 
1988 olympic games were staged the pope urged young people to 
reject violence and hatred south koreas radicals have been 
criticized for their willingness to stage violent protests 
after south korea the pope goes on to indonesia and a 
controversial stop in east timor and then to the indian ocean 
island nation of mauritius before returning to rome oct 16 
the trip is the polishborn popes 44th foreign pilgrimage and 
the first time he flew over soviet territory alitalia the italian 
airline that provided the popes jumbo jet first sought to fly 
over china 
but when beijings communist government refused the airline 
received permission from moscow 
as the boeing 747 flew over the soviet capital the pilot 
radioed a message from the pope to the kremlin said vatican 
spokesman joaquin navarro 
addressed to gorbachev the leader of a party which has 
historically disparaged religion the message from the leader of 
the worlds 850 million roman catholics said 
flying over the territory of the union of soviet socialist 
republics on my way to a pastoral visit to several asian countries 
i want to greet your excellency and assure you of my best wishes 
for the wellbeing and prosperity of your fellow citizens

true that he is a shame to the whole of latin america but i simply 
could not be in favor of military action i think the panamanians 
will take care of him i think we need to be a little bit patient 
arias on a visit to attract investment by electronics companies

the minute you send in your marines noriega will have more 
solidarity from the rest of the latin american countries arias

economic growth and justice

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev today met 
with east german leader erich honecker a day after encouraging the 
hardline government in east berlin to work with all forces in 
society 
gorbachev was in east berlin during the countrys 40th 
anniversary celebrations which have been overshadowed by the 
exodus of nearly 50000 refugees who fled to the west in search of 
greater freedom and opportunity 
in a brief dispatch the staterun news agency adn said the two 
leaders had started their meeting but did not describe the 
substance of the talks 
in a formal address the night before gorbachev said there is 
no doubt that the socialist unity party east german communist 
party has the intellectual potential rich experience and 
political authority to cooperate with all forces in society to 
answer the questions placed on todays agenda 
the masscirculation bild newspaper in west germany said friday 
that gorbachev planned to encourage honecker to make several 
changes including easing travel restrictions for east germans and 
allowing greater freedom of expression honecker has been unwilling 
to implement the economic and political reforms now under way in 
the soviet union poland and hungary 
for the third straight day east germany today barred western 
tourists from entering communist east berlin also erecting three 
barriers at the crossing called checkpoint charlie by the western 
allies 
the 6foottall barriers were set up overnight on the east 
german side of the checkpoint they apparently are designed to stop 
protests similar to those aug 13 the anniversary of the start of 
construction of the berlin wall when demonstrators tried to lie 
down on the dividing line between the two sectors and hurled 
objects at east german border police 
east germany apparently fears that regimecritics coming from 
west germany could disturb the 40th anniversary celebrations 
said west germanys ard television 
the soviet leader who was to return home later today was 
hailed by youths who shouted gorby gorby as he stood beside 
honecker during a threehour communist youth parade 
many have said democratic change might stem the westward flow of 
east german youth and avoid divisions among the east bloc nations 
east germanys leaders wanted the anniversary to portray their 
country as a socialist success 
all of our energy and loyalty to the german democratic 
republic read one of the parade banners but the exodus of 
thousands of its citizens to the west from embassies in 
czechoslovakia and poland and violent clashes between east germans 
and police have focused world attention on the countrys turmoil 
to squelch any possible protests during the anniversary the 
communist leadership stepped up security nationwide 
church sources today said police arrested eight members of the 
countrys leading opposition group new forum 
unconfirmed reports said the government was mounting barbed wire 
fences on the border with neighboring poland and czechoslovakia 
which east german refugees used as stepping stones to the west 
west germanys zdf television said a caller from east germany 
said friday barbed wire was being strung along the frontier with 
czechoslovakia the newspaper die welt said east german authorities 
were preparing to build fences along the polish border 
as anniversary festivities were about to begin in east germany 
friday a train carrying more than 600 disgruntled citizens rolled 
into west germany from warsaw the same number crossed into austria 
from hungary early today 
thousands more traveled to the west earlier in the week aboard 
other trains after east germany in what seemed an attempt to 
polish its image set free refugeseekers camping at west german 
embassies in prague and warsaw 
in a formal address late friday before the east german 
leadership gorbachev said the east german communist party can 
manage the countrys own affairs 
we have heard demands such as the ussr should take down 
the berlin wall and then people could believe in its the soviets 
peaceful aims said gorbachev our western partners should 
understand that questions regarding the gdr east germany are not 
solved in moscow but in berlin 
but without being specific gorbachev also called on the 
authoritarian leadership to reach out to all elements in society 
there is no doubt that east germanys communist party has 
the intellectual potential rich experience and political authority 
to cooperate with all forces in society to answer the questions 
placed on todays agenda he said 
the soviet leader defended moscows reforms 
in his own address honecker the 77yearold east german leader 
who has run the country for more than 18 years reaffirmed the 
countrys hard line and condemned what he said were international 
efforts aimed at the destabilization of socialism

thousands of soviets marched to the walls of the 
kremlin today to show support for boris n yeltsin and two other 
parliamentarians they claim are threatened by hardline communist 
party bureaucrats 
the protest held on constitution day a soviet holiday was 
also staged to demand that the civil and human rights enshrined in 
the 1977 soviet constitution be observed 
in a nearfreezing drizzle members and sympathizers of the 
grassroots prodemocracy russian peoples front linked hands at 11 
am to form a human chain that stretched for miles along gorky 
street the main artery leading from the kremlin to moscows 
northwestern suburbs 
demonstrators carried placards defending yeltsin moscows 
outspoken representative in the soviet congress and two state 
prosecutors in the congress telman gdlyan and nikolai ivanov who 
have alleged corruption at the partys highest levels involving 
politburo member yegor k ligachev 
yeltsin the former communist party boss in moscow came under 
attack late last month in the party daily pravda for allegedly 
going on a drinking and buying spree while visiting the united 
states 
pravda later apologized to yeltsin saying those charges made 
in an italian newspaper article that pravda reprinted could not be 
substantiated but to soviets the affair was more proof that the 
party apparatus was out to get the 58yearold communist maverick 
who has opposed privileges received by the party elite and called 
for a better life for the average soviet 
in the case of gdlyan and ivanov the partys policymaking 
central committee has ordered the moscow party organization to take 
action against them for making the charges against ligachev which 
the soviet prosecutorgenerals office said have no basis 
yeltsin gdlyan and ivanov are our conscience said one 
handlettered poster carried by a gorky street protester 
in leaflets distributed throughout the soviet capital the 
peoples front had called for muscovites to line gorky street from 
central moscow to the suburban city of zelenograd which gdlyan 
represents in the congress but organizers said bad weather kept 
participation down 
nevertheless knots of protesters were seen as far away as 
sheremetyevo airport moscows international airport 20 miles from 
the kremlin 
after making the human chain 3000 demonstrators marched to a 
paved square on marx prospekt between the kremlins high redbrick 
walls and the former quarters of moscow state university which now 
house its journalism school 
huddled under umbrellas they listened to peoples front leaders 
make speeches through bullhorns then marched back up gorky street 
to pushkin square to take part in another demonstration calling for 
an end to government restrictions on emigration 
the protests occurred while president mikhail s gorbachev was 
in east germany to attend ceremonies marking the countrys 40th 
anniversary yeltsin first got in trouble with gorbachev for 
claiming the presidents program of economic and political reforms 
was being implemented too slowly

premier miklos nemeth today urged the 
old guard of the communist party to leave if they object to 
farreaching reforms a ranking hardliner said the communist 
system should be preserved 
nemeth one of the key supporters of reform told 1274 
delegates at a party congress that the new democratic leftist party 
he wants to create from the current communist party has no room 
for those who have blood on their hands from past communist 
excesses 
those who feel unwell here should form their own party he 
declared to applause from the reformist faction at the congress 
its now possible to do that 
nemeth was alluding to hungarys new commitment to political 
plurality as it institutes reforms that put it at the forefront of 
change within the soviet bloc along with poland 
the communist leadership has agreed to permit the countrys 
first free elections in 41 years by june at the latest and has said 
it will abide by the results even if the party is voted out of 
power 
delegates at the congress which began friday are considering 
proposals to terminate their partys 70year existence and replace 
it with a new one drawing heavily on social democratic ideals 
similar to leftist parties in western europe 
hardliners by contrast want to tinker with the existing party 
but reject founding a new one former politburo member janos 
berecz an opponent of farreaching reforms who lost his post in 
recent infighting spoke bitterly of his reformminded rivals today 
i want to conserve my communist past he declared adding 
that differences with imre pozsgay the leading reformer along with 
nemeth in the fourman communist leadership truly put us in 
different parties 
you can tie me to the stake but you cant do that to the 
720000 party members represented by the delegates said berecz 
committed hardliners numbered less than 100 at the congress 
but reformists said the oldguard members are actively trying to 
enlist the support of the more than 700 delegates not committed to 
either camp before crucial voting on whether to found a new party 
and on top party positions 
a splinter group of orthodox communist radicals called the hswp 
marxist unity front claimed in a leaflet made available to 
reporters that they had majority support 
party chairman rezsoe nyers a moderate who was chosen to 
bridge differences among the fourman leadership appeared to side 
with pozsgay and nemeth friday in urging the delegates to 
effectively terminate the old party 
it is my belief that the new party cannot be communist said 
nyers the new party also cannot simply be a social democratic 
one 
nyers said the congress should give birth to a new party that 
combines communism with social democratic beliefs he did not 
elaborate 
today nyers one of the prime candidates for the post of 
chairman of the new party told hungarian radio he would accept the 
post providing the congress adopts a political platform he agrees 
with 
he said he expected those opposed to democratic socialism to 
split off but anything may happen yet at the congress 
the communists have lost a series of parliamentary byelections 
in recent months a worrisome development for the party as it 
prepares for the multiparty election 
a central committee draft document made available to reporters 
on the future partys philosophical makeup said democratic 
socialism would mean the party would support 
creation of a democratic constitutional state 
a multiparty system 
referendums and other instruments of direct democracy 
prevention of excessive centralization of power 
a freely elected parliament 
election of a president to strengthen the balance between the 
branches of power and of a government responsible to parliament 
the process of instituting bolder social and economic changes 
began slowly about two years ago but gained steam after the 
ousting of janos kadar in may 1988 after 32 years of leadership 
the pace of reform in recent months has at times moved hungary 
ahead of poland the only soviet bloc country not dominated by 
communists 
hungary has alienated three repressive warsaw pact allies east 
east germany romania and czechoslovakia with its reformist 
policies including its decision to allow east germans in hungary 
free passage to the west

orthopedic technicians who helped fit artificial limbs for victims 
of lebanons 14yearold civil war

the two swiss officials but we still have no word on their

yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction in 1973 and set up a rival 
group called fatahrevolutionary council

exits of ein elhilweh were under constant surveillance to prevent 
the kidnappers from trying to smuggle out the swiss captives

a nursing home fire that killed nine 
patients and injured nearly 100 was caused by one of its victims 
a 78yearold smoker who accidentally tossed a match on his bed 
when he missed a trash can 
authorities said friday that despite the high death toll they 
considered it lucky more people werent killed in the fire that 
broke out late thursday in the fourstory hillhaven rehabilitation 
and convalescent center 
thick black smoke from burning foam rubber mattresses filled 
the hallways hampering evacuation already made difficult by the 
frail condition of many of the patients said fire chief thomas e 
gardner 
the real problem was the smoke and the fragileness of the 
elderly residents lungs gardner said the dead were eight women 
and one man ranging in age from 65 to 97 
seven of the injured were listed in critical condition this 
morning at sentara norfolk general hospital ninetyeight residents 
were treated after the fire for smoke inhalation said don haupt 
administrator of the citys paramedical rescue service 
the fire broke out in the secondfloor room of major leary 78 
said capt herbert redfield chief of fire investigations smoking 
is prohibited in rooms at the home but leary who was recuperating 
from hip problems had been caught with cigarettes the night of the 
blaze said jeffrey m mckain hillhaven corp vice president 
smoking is allowed in lounges and public areas 
he was asked last night if he had cigarettes and he said no 
mckain said friday but its easy for a determined patient to get 
around rules 
a nurse checked room 226 about 10 pm and found leary sitting 
in a chair near the foot of his bed and his roommate asleep 
redfield said 
as investigators reconstruct the scene leary lit a cigarette 
and tossed the match toward a metal trash can about three inches 
from the foot of the bed redfield said the match landed on the 
bed setting the covers and mattress ablaze 
leary was among those who died in the fire 
gardner the fire chief said there probably would have been 
fewer deaths if there had been fire sprinklers at the nursing home 
but he said the home met all building codes when it was built in 
1969 and had passed two state inspections this year 
gardner said that further deaths were prevented by several 
factors strong fire walls and fire resistant doors quick response 
by more than 100 norfolk firefighters and paramedics the use of a 
giant pressurized ventilation system that pumped fresh air through 
the building and plain luck 
we were just lucky gardner said lucky more didnt die

chairman akio morita of sony corp grew up in a 
wealthy family surrounded by the best technology of the 1920s and 
1930s a victor phonograph a westinghouse refrigerator and a buick 
sedan 
he went to american movies king kong was a favorite 
today his company not only sets a high standard for consumer 
electronics around the world it owns americas largest record 
company and is buying a major hollywood motion picture studio 
sonys plan to pay 34 billion to take over columbia pictures 
following its buyout of cbs records in 1987 has some americans 
worried a japanese company is taking over the popular cultural 
heart of the country 
but the friendly takeover is only the latest in decades of 
international investment by a company that has proved its 
sophistication in operating around the world 
morita helped found a tiny company in the basement of a 
bombedout department store in 1946 and its early attempts at an 
electric rice cooker failed 
morita himself trained as a physicist struggled to paste 
together paper handpainted with magnetic material to use as tape 
in japans first tape recorder postwar shortages made plastic 
unavailable 
but when in the 1950s sony bought the rights to an american 
invention called the transistor and used it in ways its originators 
never imagined in radios the sony reputation for innovation was 
born 
in the 1960s sony transformed video tape recorders also an 
american invention from huge machines run with vacuum tubes to 
compact transistorized models that became the professional standard 
when it adapted those machines for home use in the 1970s it 
helped create the vcr and the culture of couch potatoes people 
who dont have to leave the house for entertainment 
in the 1980s sonys walkman became a symbol of selfabsorbed 
joggers commuters and other yuppies today its superlight 
camcorders help parents capture their childrens first steps on 
video and tiny watchman vcrs let them watch movies on the run 
now with its foray into music and movies sony may be putting 
its stamp on america of the 1990s as well but sony says it wants 
to keep the american style of the software its buying 
globally us entertainment software is the most 
influential morita said at a recent news conference columbia 
pictures and cbs records will remain in the hands of american 
management 
our motto is global localization he said and industry 
analysts say its more than an empty slogan 
almost half of sonys 78900 employees are local people in its 
27 overseas factories in places ranging from san diego to singapore 
to bridgend england 
sixtysix percent of its sales are outside japan and so is much 
of its production sony began manufacturing in the united states in 
the 1970s long before the recent wave of japanese investment there 
almost all of the televisions sony sells in the united states 
are made locally and 20 percent of its san diego production is for 
export 
sonys bridgend plant exports components all over europe and in 
1987 won a british government award for exports 
industry analysts say sonys style as well as its structure is 
far more international than most japanese companies considered an 
upstart by oldline japanese firms sony has an antihierarchical 
and risktaking style that sets it apart 
morita sets the tone one of the few true founding entrepreneurs 
still heading a major company in a country where most presidents 
are merely employees morita hawked transistor radios to retailers 
in new york and had to fight the image of poorquality that made 
in japan meant at the time 
he has a thick shock of white hair and speaks english with a 
fluency few senior japanese businessmen can boast morita 68 is 
blunt by japanese standards or even by american ones 
his recent book the japan that can say no coauthored 
with conservative politician shintaro ishihara caused a stir in 
washington for the way it pulls no punches in the usjapan 
economic debate morita has long warned that the united states must 
revitalize its electronics industry by investing more in research 
and development 
morita this year handed over daily management of sony to its 
president norio ohga an opera singer by training who was hired 
because of his frank criticism of sonys tape recorders when he was 
a student in the 1950s 
ohga is expected to lead the company beyond its roots in 
consumer electronics and into a diversified range of products from 
software to industrial electronics 
the companys sales jumped 38 percent to 163 billion in the 
year ended march 31 and profits nearly doubled to 549 million 
after several hard years when its betamax video system gradually 
lost out to the vhs standard made by other companies sony is back 
in full force analysts say 
last year sony spent more than 1 billion on research and 
development or about 7 percent of sales

president bush refuses to rule out military 
action to oust panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega but the next 
us moves are more likely to involve dollars than bullets 
the new economic strictures under consideration to step up 
pressure on noriega include the withholding of about 15 million 
in taxes paid monthly to his government on behalf of panamanian 
employees of us agencies officials said 
the officials who asked not to be identified said discussions 
about new sanctions against panama began well before the failed 
coup attempt last tuesday according to the treasury department 
sanctions imposed to date have deprived panama of about 400 
million 
other economic measures under consideration the officials said 
include limiting even further the payments us companies operating 
in panama can make to the government and prohibiting 
panamanianflag vessels from using us ports it was not clear 
what such additional sanctions would cost panama 
not all the options under discussion are economic in nature 
administration officials have sounded out congressional 
intelligence committees on the possibility of us covert actions 
against noriega but none has been approved said the sources who 
declined to be more specific 
bush talked briefly to reporters friday and defended his 
decision not to commit us forces to aid panamanian rebels during 
last tuesdays coup attempt when asked whether he might authorize 
military action in the future the president replied i would not 
rule out any option 
the administration is still convinced that a steady weakening of 
the panamanian economy will make noriegas rule increasingly 
untenable and eventually force his removal the officials said 
the economic decline panama has suffered since early 1988 was 
one of the factors cited by the coup plotters in justifying their 
action the sources noted 
by a vote of 991 the senate adopted a resolution proposed by 
sen sam nunn dga on thursday that expressed support for bushs 
efforts to democratize panama through a full range of economic 
diplomatic and military options 
but the administration does not appear intent on deviating too 
far from the policy of economic denial and diplomatic pressure 
instituted by former president reagan 19 months ago 
among other measures the united states has withheld payments to 
panama for canal operations and has frozen an estimated 300 
million worth of panamanian assets in us banks some trade 
benefits including sugar exports also have been denied 
bush has hoped these measures would damage the panamanian 
economy to the point that the defense forces would move against 
noriega his actions last tuesday at the time of the coup attempt 
indicate a strong preference to limit direct us military 
involvement in efforts to oust noriega 
the administration is not contemplating a complete trade embargo 
against panama because that would put hundreds of us companies 
operating there out of business the officials said 
bush has come under criticism from many members of congress as 
well as from some conservative outside government for not moving 
more aggressively in support of the coup leaders last tuesday 
former assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
elliott abrams said the us policy of speeches and sanctions 
against noriega is not enough 
to borrow a slogan from theodore roosevelt who was profoundly 
involved in panamanian affairs its time for the us to speak 
more softly but carry and contemplate using a big stick 
abrams says 
but former ambassador sol linowitz who helped negotiate the 
panama canal treaties says that military action could put at risk 
the 50000 american citizens in panama 
the military option cant be done without significant 
bloodshed linowitz told a reporter thursday he also opposes 
additional sanctions because the ones already in place have 
destroyed the economy without budging noriega 
linowitz advocates reviving the diplomatic effort in the 
organization of american states suspended six weeks ago aimed 
at negotiating a restoration of democratic rule in panama 
according to us officials there are about 18000 panamanians 
working for the panama canal commission and other us agencies 
the 15 million the us government pays to panama on behalf of 
the panamanian employees of us agencies ostensibly is used for 
education and health care but american officials believe the funds 
are used for other purposes 
they acknowledged that the panamanian government could retaliate 
by withholding health and education benefits against employees 
whose taxes are not paid by us agencies 
noriega is said to need 30 million to 40 million a month to 
run the government and officials believe ways must be found to cut 
into his income as much as possible without destroying the 
panamanian economy in the process

back in 1937 taking the oath of office for a 
second time president franklin d roosevelt said he saw one 
third of a nation illhoused illclad illnourished 
half a century later with tens of thousands of americans 
marching on washington to demand housing now what percentage 
are still illhoused 
about one fourth says daniel hoffman research director of 
the american affordable housing institute at rutgers university in 
new brunswick nj 
about 24 million families are living in housing that the 
government classifies as having a problem said hoffman the 
number of renters has gone up after declining for years and years 
and at the the same time the quality and quantity of the housing 
stock of the country has declined every year in every region 
about that there is little dispute in a field swamped by 
statistics and often contradictory studies no argument exists over 
the claim of the demonstrators america has a housing problem 
agreement comes from james christian chief economist for the 
us league of savings institutions in washington but he declines 
to compare the size of the problem to fdrs one third of a nation 
oh lord he says the estimates of this thing go from 
hell to breakfast 
at the center of the problem he puts the cost of land 
especially land where people want to build housing 
where there are jobs there are higher incomes and where 
incomes are higher there are enough people who can afford to pay 
for the privilege of using the land to push out of the market those 
people who cant afford to pay he says 
land is just a major part of the affordability problem 
researcher hoffman a housing planner for 15 years instead lays 
the problem at two basic sources a change in the federal 
governments housing policies starting with ronald reagans 
inauguration in 1981 and a departure from the historic levels of 
interest rates 
government policy affected housing for the poor he says and 
high interest rates affected the middle class and made the 
american dream of home ownership remote for millions 
with reagan says hoffman the federal government essentially 
got out of the subsidized housing business were not building any 
more subsidized housing it declined with jimmy carter and stopped 
with reagan in 1979 we were building 40000 public housing units 
for the poorest of the poor now none zero 
and a change in the tax law in 1986 has reduced builders 
interest in unsubsidized rental construction 
as for interest rates for mortgage loans theyre running about 
10 percent a year give or take half a point down from their 
dramatic levels of 1982 lower than they have been in 15 years but 
still high by historic measurement 
this country wasnt built on 10 percent mortgages hoffman 
says people used to get mortages at 4 percent and as recent as 
the early 1970s it was 7 percent 
he does some calculating determines that a house with a 
30year 80000 mortage could be paid for at 530 a month when the 
interest rate was 7 percent but requires 702 monthly at 10 
percent 
homebuilding hoffman says is still a booming industry in 
america but what is being built typically is big glitzy housing 
on big lots in the suburbs for the tradeup market 
the median priced house half costing more half less cannot 
be afforded by the medianincome family says hoffman 
bank economist christian on the other hand waves away interest 
costs as a major factor 
mortgage money is available today at lower rather than 10 
years ago he says cutting mortgage rates another percentage 
point or two will not solve this problem every nickel you gain in 
lower interest costs tends to be lost in higher land prices or 
higher consturction costs 
christian tries to picture the problem that brought 
demonstrators to washington as broader than a housing shortage 
its a whole social service delivery problem he says 
housing just happens to be the most visible piece of that 
especially when you see somebody sleepoing on a grate 
but it isnt necessarily a housing affordability problem if 
that person doesnt have a job is it then an employment problem 
look one step beyond that he may not have a job because he lacks 
skills do we have an educational problem here

americas elderly flexed their powerful 
political muscles in turning congress against medicares new 
catastrophic health insurance program but analysts say the notion 
of a monolithic gray lobby that speaks with one voice is 
largely myth 
william schneider of the american enterprise institute said the 
rush in congress to roll back the medicare catastrophic program 
enacted just a year earlier confirms the elderly hold sway over 
congress because of their voting power 
this is an enormous constituency they are organized and they 
know how to take it out on congress at the polls schneider said 
census bureau figures show that older americans turn out to vote 
more faithfully than the population overall and that their ranks 
will mushroom as the baby boom generation ages 
but many analysts and advocates for the elderly believe congress 
is bowing to the demands of an outspoken minority within the senior 
population as it backpedals on the catastrophic package to the 
detriment of most older americans 
what you saw was the clout of the vocal and the articulate 
elderly who also tend to be more affluent said fernando 
torrezgil associate professor of gerontology at the university of 
southern california no one represented the needs of the poor 
robert binstock professor of aging health and society at case 
western reserve university said the catastrophic debate has served 
to highlight the diversity of 65andover population 
you dont get homogenized on a birthday binstock said 
the idea of the clout of the elderly is a misinformed cliche 
he said election analyses show that elderly people distribute 
their votes among candidates in the same proportions as do people 
of all ages 
they vote more frequently but they dont all vote the same 
binstock said 
members of congress have been inundated with complaints from 
senior citizens about the yearold medicare catastrophic coverage 
act enacted with fanfare to protect the elderly and disabled from 
financial ruin in a serious illness 
the program offers significant new hospital doctor and 
prescription drug coverage to 33 million americans and requires 
the elderly to foot the entire bill through increased medicare 
premiums for all but the poorest beneficiaries and a special surtax 
of up to 800 a year imposed on higherincome retirees 
however the house has already voted to repeal the program 
outright and the senate to drastically cut benefits as a way of 
eliminating the unpopular surtax the final resolution awaits 
conference committee action 
legislators leading the rollback movement say they are 
responding to broadbased opposition from elderly people angry at 
being forced to pay for benefits they neither want nor need 
those trying to salvage the program argue that the protests 
primarily are the handiwork of betteroff seniors opposed to the 
surtax 
about 60 percent of the 33 million americans covered by medicare 
would not be subject to the surtax at all they would be billed a 
flat 4amonth this year for the additional coverage 
less than 6 percent of the 33 million medicareeligibles would 
have to pay the maximum 800 a year surtax 
one leading advocate of the catastrophic package rep fortney 
pete stark dcalif said legislators were being stampeded 
by a group representing a small group of the wealthiest seniors 
to deny needed benefits to a majority of seniors 
rep jim bunning rky however maintained opposition was 
virtually unanimous you dont generate a storm this size with 
just a few isolated elderly people he said 
rick moody of the brookdale center on aging at hunter college in 
new york city said the opposition represents an oldfashioned 
taxpayer revolt by individuals angry at the mandatory surtax 
what really galvanized people was the fear that they were 
going to pay higher taxes moody said tax revolts are nothing 
new 
the catastrophic debate in reality has been a defeat for the 
gray lobby moody said since major advocacy groups such as the 
american association of retired persons supported the program but 
couldnt deliver the support of their members 
the concept of the gray lobby is dramatically overblown 
moody said in this case the gray lobby largely bought into this 
bill and was repudiated by the taxpayers 
torrezgil said advocacy groups such as aarp may find their 
influence diminished now that elderly people have mobilized at the 
grassroots level and split with their leaders in washington 
the elderly constituency is no longer a homogeneous group 
torrezgill said it is breaking down into components 
such divisions aside schneider said the elderly have been and 
remain probably the most powerful constituency in the country 
because they vote 
what changed wasnt the clout of the elderly what changed was 
the nature of their demands schneider said all of the sudden 
they astonished everyone by becoming an antitax constituency

documents obtained from the international agency 
that regulates trade in ivory show it gets 77 percent of its money 
from ivory traders an arrangement under fire from 
environmentalists trying to save the african elephant 
many environmentalists want a ban on commerce in elephant tusks 
without it they say the beast that poet john donne called 
natures great masterpiece could be virtually extinct in africa 
in a generation 
but the ivory control unit of the regulatory agency the 
convention on international trade in endangered species of wild 
fauna and flora or cites opposes such a ban 
that has set the stage for confrontation at the cites biannual 
meeting beginning monday in lausanne switzerland 
environmentalists say cites opposes a ban because it depends 
upon the largesse of ivory traders cites says a ban wont stop 
poaching 
the population of african elephants has declined from 13 
million in 1979 to an estimated 625000 according to a study by 
the ivory trade review group a team of environmentalists and 
biologists from around the world the study will be published next 
week 
wellarmed highly organized poachers who travel freely across 
african borders in pursuit of elephant tusks are killing 10 percent 
of the remaining elephants each year the study concluded 
at that rate elephants will be extinct in the wild within 30 
years said one of the studys authors david western the director 
of wildlife conservation international of new york 
the elephant is in trouble said western who has 
specialized in elephant studies for several years 
the loss of habitat is not the driving force nor is 
population growth he said in an interview the driving force 
according to our studies is the ivory trade 
elephant carcasses are left to rot in the sun on africas dusty 
savannahs while their tusks are shipped to hong kong to be carved 
into trinkets and baubles said richard leakey the eminent 
anthropologist who is now director of wildlife in kenya 
ivory serves no functional purpose he said we surely 
have reached the stage in our civilization and emancipation where 
we dont need to wear the parts of other animals to decorate 
ourselves 
environmentalists helped persuade japan hong kong europe and 
the united states to halt ivory imports beginning last june hong 
kong is the headquarters of the ivory trade japan its largest 
consumer 
cites opposition to a ban has attracted little support except 
from a few african countries that profit from ivory other african 
countries favor a ban fearing the loss of tourism revenue if the 
elephants disappear 
jaques berney deputy secretary general of cites denies the 
agencys opposition to a ban is related to support by ivory traders 
its completely wrong berney said in a telephone interview 
from the agencys headquarters in lausanne our analysis of the 
problem is not based on money if we hadnt accepted this 
money there would not be any ivory unit and the system would have 
completely failed 
curtis bohlen senior vice president of the world wildlife fund 
in washington said i believe the secretary general has 
exercised very bad judgment in accepting these contributions 
because it leads people to the very obvious conclusion that that 
has influenced their decision on a ban 
cites pronounced sightees is the principal international 
agency responsible for the regulation of trade in all endangered 
species since cites was established in 1973 as part of the united 
nations environment program 102 countries have joined it 
at the meeting delegates will consider a proposal by tanzania 
that elephants be shifted from cites appendix ii which allows 
legal ivory trade with import quotas onto appendix i which would 
prohibit ivory trade a twothirds vote is required for the change 
berney said the agencys secretariat believes a ban simply wont 
work 
the main problem is poaching which in our opinion will not be 
solved by a ban on ivory trade he said furthermore a ban might 
be ignored by some countries such as south africa which culls 
ivory from protected elephant herds he said 
even the most ardent supporters of a ban argue that it must be 
accompanied by antipoaching programs in africa but the ban is a 
necessary ingredient of any effort to halt the elephants decline 
they say 
the quota system for elephants under appendix ii has 
totally failed said leakey lets see if stopping it will 
work 
according to cites figures its ivory control unit has received 
308647 in contributions since 1985 of that 238470 or 77 
percent has come from ivory traders many of them in japan and 
hong kong 
cites other activities are supported by contributions from 
member nations berney said the secretariat had proposed inclusion 
of the ivory unit in the membersupported budget but delegates to 
the 1987 cites meeting didnt want to increase the budget 
governments and environmental groups were asked for 
contributions the problem berney said is that the only 
people who have really provided money in considerable quantities 
are the ivory traders 
underlying the dispute is scientific disagreement over the 
danger the ivory trade poses to elephants 
while elephant specialists see evidence of a serious decline 
cites sees little need for drastic action 
there is no disagreement about the decline of the elephants 
berney said but to say that the elephant is an endangered animal 
throughout africa is in our point of view exaggerated 
western however said projections indicate the elephant is 
going to be effectively extinct much much sooner than almost any 
other animal on the endangered list 
computer models developed by the ivory trade review group were 
used to determine what action might stem the decline only one 
option made any difference said western ban trade entirely 
he said poaching has disrupted the family and breeding structure 
of elephant herds bulls sought for their large tusks are so 
scarce some females cant find mates the slaughter of females 
leaves orphans that die soon after 
from 1979 to 1987 africas ivory exports fell from 900 metric 
tons to 300 metric tons according to the ivory trade review group 
yet the slaughter has not appreciably declined 
in 1979 the group calculated poachers had to slaughter 54 
elephants to reap a metric ton of ivory by 1987 after older 
elephants with larger tusks had gradually disappeared it took 113 
elephants to produce a metric ton of tusks in addition 55 
orphaned calves died for each metric ton collected they produced 
no ivory 
the ivory trade is estimated to be worth 1 billion a year most 
of which goes to the traders and craftsmen african countries where 
ivory trade flourishes earned only a few million dollars from ivory 
sales in 1987 western said 
elephants are worth far more to tourism bringing an estimated 
50 million a year into kenya alone he said that is why kenya and 
its neighbor tanzania favor a ban he said 
the ivory trade review group acknowledged in its study that a 
ban carries risks it will drive ivory trade underground putting 
it in the hands of criminals and could push up prices by making 
ivory scarce 
the group concluded in its report however that to persevere 
with the present inadequate approach is to make failure and the 
drastic decline of the worlds greatest land animal inevitable

home ownership declined in the 1980s for the 
first time since world war ii sen lloyd bentsen said saturday 
citing high prices and high interest rates 
in the decades following world war ii you saw home ownership 
continue to climb but in the 80s it headed downhill said 
bentsen dtexas and the reasons were that housing costs 
were up but one of the big ones interest rates were up 
according to a study by a senior economist for the joint 
economic committee of congress home ownership peaked at 656 
percent of the population in 1980 and then began falling hitting 
639 percent last year 
the study found home ownership had fallen dramatically in the 
youngest age groups in 1973 nearly onefourth or 234 percent of 
people under age 25 owned a home in 1988 the rate was 155 
percent 
in other younger age groups the situation is similar 436 
percent of 25to29yearolds were homeowners in 1973 falling to 
362 percent in 1988 for the 30to34yearold group 602 percent 
owned homes in 1973 dropping to 526 percent in 1988 and in the 
35to39 bracket the rate fell from 685 percent in 1973 to 632 
percent in 1988 
the average age of firsttime homebuyers has jumped to 32 now 
up from 28 years old in 1980 the study said 
housing affordability is determined by several factors 
including tax policy income growth and housing prices the study 
said 
rising house prices are reflected particularly in down payment 
requirements the study said in this decade alone the average 
down payment for firsttime home buyers has risen more than 50 
percent from 8600 in 1981 to 13000 in 1988 
the other major hurdle to home ownership is interest rates the 
study said 
the interest cost along of a 100000 fixed rate 30year 
mortgage at 6 percent the prevailing rate in the 1960s would have 
been 115841 with a monthly house payment of 600 
at 9 percent the prevailing rate of the mid1970s the total 
interest cost would have been 188810 with the monthly payments 
802 
but at 105 percent the prevailing mortgage rate today that 
interest cost would be 229306 nearly double the interest cost 
off a 6 percent mortgage and monthly house payments would be 915 
thats a tough hill to climb said bentsen the chairman of 
the senate finance committee who is pushing for congress to 
reinstate partial tax deductions for contributions to individual 
retirement accounts 
under bentsens proposal ira contributions could be withdrawn 
without penalty for the purchase of a first home or for education 
expenses 
bentsen said his ira plan which has been offered as an 
alternative to president bushs proposed cut in the capital gains 
tax would give people an incentive to save money for their first 
home a college education or retirement 
now if we accomplish those things with savings and the 
withdrawal without any penalty youll have a great increase in the 
amount of capital in this country and thatll bring interest rates 
down and that helps the entire country bentsen said

israeli leaders said saturday they are 
considering an offer by secretary of state james a baker iii for 
threeway talks involving israel egypt and the united states to 
try to break the deadlock in the middle east peace process 
leaders of israels two major parties said they were encouraged 
by the offer but it was likely to face strong opposition from 
hardliners in prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc 
on friday israels policymaking inner cabinet voted to reject 
an egyptian proposal for talks in cairo on elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the centerleft labor party the junior partner in the coalition 
government supported egyptian president hosni mubaraks plan but 
the likud opposed it and the cabinet deadlocked 66 that meant the 
proposal was rejected 
in washington us officials said baker was trying to keep the 
egyptian proposal alive they said that after the israeli cabinet 
vote baker spoke by telephone with israeli foreign minister moshe 
arens and egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid 
arens said baker proposed that israel egypt and the united 
states meet for consultations on the formation of a palestinian 
delegation for peace talks 
this offer does not contain the dangers in the proposal 
rejected friday arens told israel radio 
arens a senior likud official said the difference between the 
baker and the mubarak proposals was whether israel is to meet 
with a plo delegation or a delegation of palestinians set up with 
our agreement 
likud objects to the participation of palestinians from outside 
the occupied territories but the palestinians have demanded this 
as a compromise mubarak has proposed that palestinians who have 
been deported from the territories participate likud rejects this 
seeing it as a backdoor opening to the plo israel officially views 
the plo as a terror group and refuses to deal with it 
arens said baker first made his offer in a telephone 
conversation last week and he asked baker thursday to formally 
submit the proposal to israel he said the offer could be discussed 
in the governments next meeting 
labor party leader shimon peres said he did not see any real 
differences between the baker offer and the mubarak proposal 
in cairo abdelmeguid said that consultations are under way 
with the united states and israel he did not elaborate 
hardliners in the likud have said they will oppose the baker 
offer as staunchly as they fought mubaraks proposal 
there are not going to be any more concessions on the israeli 
side trade minister ariel sharon said following the cabinet vote 
some labor officials are urging their party to quit the 
coalition government over the peace stalemate 
peres said saturday his party would consider withdrawing if 
there is no progress toward peace 
what is clear is that this situation cannot continue peres 
said there are a number of possible actions we can take and we 
will examine them 
the israeli peace initiative which the government endorsed in 
may calls for the election of palestinians to negotiate an interim 
autonomy agreement with israel the final status of the occupied 
lands would be determined later 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt during the 1967 middle east war palestinians living in 
the occupied territories have been waging an uprising against 
israeli rule since december 1987 and are pursuing their longtime 
goal of creating an independent state 
since the uprising began 585 palestinians have been killed by 
israeli troops or civilians another 127 palestinians have been 
killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with 
israel forty israelis have died

ptl founder jim bakkers waffling 
testimony combined with a skillful job by prosecutors to convict 
the tv evangelist of defrauding thousands of loyal supporters who 
sent him 158 million court observers say 
what the prosecutors did was masterful said charlotte 
lawyer mike scofield a former federal prosecutor who watched the 
trial closely they simplified and clarified what could have been 
a very difficult and confusing case 
ken andreson another former assistant us attorney said 
prosecutors deborah smith and jerry miller did their homework 
before bringing bakker to federal court 
they were very adept at using bakkers own statements to their 
maximum advantage he said they cast him in the light they 
wanted the jurors to see him 
following a day and a half of deliberations a jury thursday 
convicted the former ptl leader of all 24 counts of mail fraud 
wire fraud and conspiracy prosecutors accused him of diverting 
37 million of the 158 million sent in for ptl partnerships to 
his own use 
bakker faces maximum penalties of 120 years in prison and more 
than 5 million in fines when he is sentenced oct 24 
the evangelist who posted 250000 bond and returned to his 
home in orlando fla planned to address his followers at a church 
service there sunday don baldwin acting general manager of jim 
and tammy ministries said saturday 
more than 50 loyal bakker supporters were among the 75 witnesses 
called by defense attorneys harold bender and george t davis many 
of the character witnesses acknowledged under crossexamination 
that no facts that came up in the trial could alter their view of 
bakker 
defense witness ken coppersmith reflected their bitterness at 
the verdict theres freedom and justice for all except jim 
bakker 
other supporters accused us district judge robert potter a 
conservative reagan appointee of bias against their hero after 
the verdict potter had said he hesitated to release bakker on bail 
because he believed some bakker followers had a jim jones 
mentality 
scofield and andreson praised potter and the prosecutors for 
maintaining control of a trial that often resembled a soap opera 
it featured a hurricanecaused blackout bakker praying for a 
fainting witness and suffering an emotional breakdown and his 
tearful wife tammy faye reacting to the verdict by singing gospel 
juror barbara dalley said bakker hurt himself when he took the 
stand as the last defense witness 
he contradicted so many other witnesses testimony she 
said none of us believed he was telling the truth 
prosecutors portrayed bakker as a con man who lied on tv to get 
people to send him money during the nearly sixweek trial they 
called more than 100 witnesses but never strayed far from their 
focus on the fraud cases victims ptls faithful lifetime 
partners 
from 198487 nearly 153000 people became partners typically 
by sending in 1000 in return for a promise of three free nights 
of lodging each year for life at ptls 2400acre christian retreat 
in nearby fort mill sc 
with the help of ms smith a justice department fraud 
specialist and miller an assistant us attorney the jurors were 
able to associate the specific wire and mail fraud charges with 
individual victims 
one count focused on the plight of retired coal miner lamar 
kerstetter who suffers from black lung disease 
asked what he expected in return for his 1000 the resident of 
shamokin pa responded my four days and three nights 
there was constant juxtaposition of the victims with witnesses 
who testified about the extravagances of jim bakker scofield 
said 
andreson said the government was able to dispel the public image 
bakker built through years of tv appearances heralding family 
values on his christian talk show 
they were able to create an identity in the courtroom i 
believe not many people were aware of before the trial he said 
its hard to like someone who spent 100 on cinnamon buns just 
to toss them out he said 
bakkers former bodyguard testified that he once purchased 100 
worth of cinnamon buns because the bakkers liked the aroma after 
several days the uneaten buns were thrown out 
bakkers former accountant testified that the bakkers once 
earned only about 600 in interest on their bank accounts in a year 
in which bakker earned about 700000 because the money came and 
went so quickly 
the jury was shown eight hours of videotapes in which bakker was 
seen over and over hawking partnerships as he sold more than twice 
the number that could be accommodated at existing ptl facilities 
only one of the hotels that he showed viewers plans for was 
finished before bakker resigned march 19 1987 after revelation of 
his sexual encounter with jessica hahn

a strong undersea earthquake struck 130 
miles southeast of amchitka island early saturday and was felt 
there and on other aleutian islands an official said there were 
no reports of damage 
the quakes preliminary magnitude on the richter scale was 67 
said paul whitmore a spokesman for the alaska tsunami warning 
center at palmer he said the earthquake occurred at 748 am adt 
officials of the center said the earthquake was felt strongly at 
amchitka island and moderately at adak island about 200 miles to 
the east but a warning of a tsunami or large wave popularly known 
as a tidal wave was not issued 
the 1964 good friday earthquake in alaska measured 85 on 
the richter scale and was centered in prince william sound it 
generated large waves that devastated several coastal communities 
and killed 131 people as far south as oregon and hawaii 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 
times strong than one of 65 
an earthquake of magnitude 35 can cause slight damage 4 
moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 severe damage a 
magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake capable of widespread 
damage 8 is a great quake capable of tremendous damage

bette davis was remembered saturday as the 
ideal motion picture actress a powerfully talented perfectionist 
who overcame hollywoods glamour fixation to become one of its 
unfading stars 
miss davis a twotime academy award winner died friday at the 
american hospital in paris after a long fight with cancer she was 
81 
she was a beacon of light for all of us who were starting 
out said angela lansbury who said she idolized the movie star 
as a child in england she appeared with miss davis in the 1982 
television miniseries little gloria happy at last 
she once said to me the thing about us were character 
actresses she wasnt a great beauty and she knew that miss 
lansbury said from her home in los angeles she was a tremendous 
role model for me she simply encouraged my aspirations as also not 
being a great beauty 
i admired her dogged attention to keep going she never 
never gave up to the very end 
a perfectionist miss davis loathed sloppy work miss lansbury

hollywood actor who appeared with miss davis in the 1939 film 
dark victory called her one of the true greats in the motion 
picture business she gave us some of the most memorable moments in 
the history of film and touched us in a way few others have 
for bette acting was more than a profession it was an art 
glenn ford credited miss davis with restarting his acting career 
after world war ii 
when i got back after the war she gave me a role opposite her 
in a 1946 film called a stolen life and from there i went on 
because of bette i was able to begin again after id been away for

supreme court or no its one american 
flag no one will be able to set afire a 12foottall us flag 
made out of a spare steel beam 
the point of this is to show in a symbolic way that theres 
something you cant destroy and thats the american flag said 
frank gallo an art professor at the university of illinois he 
teamed up with a friend metal worker aaron kurland to create the 
sculpture unveiled friday along a city street 
the two call the sculpture the flag that will not burn they 
were inspired by the uproar over flag desecration but gallo also 
sensed a challenge 
it seemed to be almost the antithesis of an ibeam gallo 
said the contrast is so interesting what a challenge it would 
be to see if we can create a sense of fluid movement inside of 
something that absolutely couldnt be conceived of as moving 
the sculpture is designed to catch sunlight at various times of 
the day and there are plans to light it up at night

some residents of weed a town of 3000 nearly 300 miles north 
of san francisco had to sit on folding chairs in the aisles during 
the concert

red cross officials returned to sidon on 
saturday a day after two swiss colleagues were kidnapped by 
unidentified gunmen but relief operations will remain suspended 
until the men are freed 
our operations have been suspended in sidon pending the 
release of our two abducted comrades said mohammed bizri 
lebanese representative of the international committee of the red 
cross in sidon 
the red cross team drove to beirut on friday evening after 
orthopedic technicians emanuel cristen 32 and elio elliquez 23 
were kidnapped in sidon and driven off toward the nearby ein 
elhilweh palestinian refugee camp 
in bern switzerland carlos bauverd a spokesman for the 
international committee of the red cross told swiss radio the team 
returned to sidon saturday morning but he stressed that operations 
in the south were still frozen 
contacts are under way on all levels to help secure the 
release of the two swiss officials but we still have no word on 
their whereabouts or who is holding them bizri told reporters 
fridays abductions raised the number of westerners missing in 
lebanon to 18 the others are eight amercians four britons two 
west germans an irishman and an italian most are believed to be 
held by proiranian shiite moslems 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east

the state sued a company that sells 
light bulbs over the telephone charging it claims all its 
employees are handicapped when they may have nothing more disabling 
than hangnails or hay fever 
the lawsuit filed friday in jackson county court said workers 
for local handicapped workers inc have called thousands of people 
in missouri since last april claiming that all the employees 
here are handicapped then the solicitors asked the customers to 
buy light bulbs for up to 541 each 
investigators from state attorney general william l websters 
office say that when they posed as job applicants at the business 
supervisors told them they could earn up to 600 a week and that 
handicaps could include pregnancy hangnails allergies or the 
need for eyeglasses 
i seriously doubt anyone who purchased light bulbs from the 
company would consider wearing glasses a handicap webster said 
we contend the company misled consumers by telling them a group 
of handicapped people were selling light bulbs for a living 
when one investigator could not identify a handicap the manager 
told her to go home and think of a handicap and call back and 
she would be hired according to the lawsuit 
the lawsuit seeks 1000 for each violation of state consumer 
fraud laws and refunds for people who bought bulbs from the 
company 
an attorney for the company dan allmayer said the company 
denies the charges meanwhile a court order bars it from using the 
word handicapped in its sales pitches

publication of an aidseducation pamphlet on 
the use of condoms has run into another delay at the department of 
health and human services 
the brochure has been circulating at the department for two 
years and recently was sent back for review by kay james assistant 
secretary for public affairs who said she wanted it to be more 
specific about condom failures 
james a former director of public affairs for the national 
right to life committee also said in an interview saturday that 
she wanted more information about the audience the brochure was 
intended to reach 
that wasnt made clear to me whether it would be widely 
distributed or given just to high school students she said 
you would do a different brochure for different audiences 
james acknowledged that she sent the brochure back to the public 
health service for further review but denied her action was 
ideologically driven 
peoples lives are at stake she said when people are 
making decisions about their sexual behavior they need to have 
accurate information and thats my only concern 
however sources within the public health service who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity said some people have expressed concern 
because they believe james is personally opposed to using public 
money to promote condom use 
the washington post in saturday editions quoted a senior 
federal health official as saying we have a major battle on our 
hands and we are fighting with at least one arm tied behind our 
back how can we explain that in the 10th year of an epidemic that 
has killed so many of our young people we are not able to help 
them use the only method we know can help 
former surgeon general c everett koop who was often at odds 
with the reagan administration over his advocacy of condom use 
also said the brochure is needed 
in view of the large number of letters the public health 
service has received about concerns on how to use a condom it 
seems clear that such a brochure is long overdue koop told the 
post 
james allen director of the national aids program office said 
saturday that a brochure on condom use is needed but acknowledged 
that such a document raises concern for some 
as a federal government that is paying for it with tax dollars 
we are subject to a lot of criticism but that doesnt mean we shy 
away he said it means we try to take different sensitivities 
into view 
the pamphlet is being reviewed by jeff nesbit head of public 
affairs for the food and drug administration who said it had been 
sent to james office by his predecessor and that he had not yet 
looked through it 
i consider this part of the normal review process he said 
it is not all that unusual

sixteenyearold richard whitaker has moved 
with his family six times in the last 10 years spending time in a 
temporary shelter until his father found a job 
being a boy scout was just one of the things he missed out on 
until the scouts reached out to him and other disadvantaged 
youngsters housed in family shelters and welfare hotels around the 
country 
just because theyre homeless doesnt mean they cant do well 
in school or be a boy scout said howard sidney a counselor at 
the anna m sample house 
the camden shelter where whitaker lived with his family until 
they rented a home nearby about three months ago is headquarters 
for boy scout troop 108 part of the scoutreach program started 
last year 
whitaker is one of the troops 16 boys some from the shelter 
and others from the neighborhood in this beleaguered city of 85000 
where about 27 percent of the population is on welfare and an 
estimated 500 people are homeless in any given month including 85 
children 
most people my age say its not cool being a boy scout 
whitaker said but i think its kind of fun i can be a role 
model 
the scoutreach program has produced troops in shelters welfare 
hotels and storefronts in new york baltimore washington dc 
and detroit said lee sneath a spokesman for the irving 
texasbased boy scouts 
its more of an evolutionary process than it is a 
revolutionary process sneath said now that society is 
recognizing the plight of these people were simply responding 
camdens troop 108 is among more than 130000 scout troops 
across the nation and one of the most recent formed for the urban 
homeless and poor the nation has 43 million youngsters involved 
in scouting 
the scoutreach troops participate in many of the same activities 
as regular troops including camping trips and earning merit 
badges members of whitakers troop can earn badges by cleaning and 
performing other chores at the shelter 
by having a boy scout troop that meets right at the shelter 
it gives them a sense of participation in a mainstream 
institution said harold oliver jr director of emergency 
services for the private agency that runs the camden shelter 
hope is the most important item we have to deal with at the 
shelter said oliver the boy scouts deliver hope in big doses 
to these boys and their families 
members of troop 103 based at a welfare hotel in new york city 
will participate in the scouts nationwide food drive nov 18 
sneath said 
here is a troop that is literally at the bottom of the 
economic rung yet they are involved themselves in helping 
others sneath said 
in fort worth texas explorer post 588 is based at willoughby 
house a halfway house for girls the 18 girls and women in the 
post have served time for criminal offenses from petty theft to 
drugs 
in camden whitakers mother betty serves as a den mother and 
his father robert is one of three scoutmasters 
it feels great mrs whitaker said 
the family was forced to move into the shelter after robert 
whitaker lost his job and could not find another he now works as a 
security guard 
the camden troop which went on a weeklong camping trip last 
summer is organizing activities to raise 1200 to buy uniforms 
and handbooks 
the basic vision on this is that these children are normal 
children and they have the desires and expectations of any 
children oliver said 
membership in new york citys troop 103 fluctuates between 15 
and 30 boys said armando mejiagallardo a scoutreach adviser and 
the troops first scoutmaster 
he said scoutreach will help change the future of the 
disadvantaged scouts 
they dont feel confined to a cycle of poverty anymore said 
mejiagallardo theyre going beyond that

colleagues friends and a generation of fans on 
saturday mourned bette davis who began her career playing nasty 
driven women and died more than a halfcentury later as one of the 
worlds most beloved film stars 
the 81yearold actress died friday night at the american 
hospital in paris a hospital spokesman confirmed saturday 
the twotime oscar winning actress had been on her way home to 
west hollywood calif from a film festival in san sebastian 
spain where she had been honored for a lifetime of achievement and 
had won the hearts of the festival audience with her warmth wit 
and honesty 
in new york her longtime attorney howard schiff said she died 
of cancer and that she had battled the disease since a mastectomy 
in 1983 during that same year she also suffered a stroke and a 
broken hip 
her doctors knew the cancer had spread and was terminal he 
said but decided to let her go on going about her business 
her business was film and over the course of 59 years she 
starred in some of americas most memorable movies 
among her more than 80 films were of human bondage all 
about eve and dark victory she was nominated for the academy 
award 10 times and won the best actress award for dangerous in 
1935 and jezebel in 1938 
what a loss said actress olivia de havilland who worked 
with miss davis in four films including the 1964 hush hush 
sweet charlotte 
she was a remarkable person to work with highly professional 
innovative brilliant and quick said miss de havilland 73 i 
thought she had some marvelous personal qualities and i was very 
fond of her 
vincent price who worked with miss davis on the private lives 
of elizabeth and essex in 1939 and whales of august in 1987 
said in los angeles there are very few people left who really 
sum up the motion picture industry who had that star quality it 
was really rare she had extraordinary energy she was a genius 
in a statement from los angeles former president reagan who 
starred with miss davis in the 1939 film dark victory said she 
made some of the most memorable moments in the history of film 
and touched us in a way few others have for bette acting was more 
than a profession it was an art 
actor charlton heston paid homage to miss davis as one of the 
most significant women to shape american film both through her 
talents as an actress and her spirited character 
i mark what she has done and while i salute her passing i 
rejoice that we still have her work heston said in a telephone 
interview 
angela lansbury who costarred with miss davis in the 1982 
television miniseries little gloria happy at last said the 
actress was the last of the great hollywood stars she was a 
beacon of light for all of us who were starting out 
miss davis attributed her success more to hard work than genius 
and she was known for being as strong and uncompromising offscreen 
as some of the characters she portrayed the line most identified 
with her was what a dump from the film beyond the forest 
she also was credited with giving the gold oscar statue its 
name according to the story she contended the statues rear end 
resembled that of her first husband whose middle name was oscar 
the person who wants to make it has to sweat miss davis 
once said there are no shorcuts and youve got to have the guts 
to be hated thats the hardest part 
but there was only admiration and affection from the press and 
participants at the spanish film festival she attended two weeks 
before her death

she charmed reporters at a sept 21 news conference with 
comments on her colleagues such as costars james stewart i 
never should have let him get away and reagan he never had 
much talent but as president he restored patriotism for 
americans 
of her expressive eyes which inspired the 1982 pop song bette 
davis eyes she said its my basic facial feature and what 
communicated to the camera 
she was frail at the festival and spent most of the time resting 
at her hotel but she put on a brave face when talking to 
reporters saying she had been taking care of details including 
makeup to appear beautiful before you all and offer you the very 
best of myself 
her success story was one of hollywoods most unlikely tales 
lacking the traditional hollywood glamour girl looks the skinny 
youngster with the huge eyes relied on her acting skill and took 
roles nobody else wanted playing nasty women more often than nice 
ones 
born ruth elizabeth davis on april 5 1908 in lowell mass 
she was always proud of her ancestors who had helped settle new 
england 
because her mother also was named ruth the young miss davis 
came to be called bette after a character in the balzac novel la 
cousine bette 
as a teenager she showed talent in school theater and pursued 
her desire to act by landing small roles in new england summer 
theater 
she made her new york stage debut in the earth between in 
the 1920s and by 1930 had landed a threemonth contract with 
universal pictures that took her to hollywood 
her film debut came the next year in bad sister five other 
pictures followed 
of her early films critic pauline kael wrote bette davis 
introduced a more complicated sexual character driving 
neurotic that captured the mood of the time 
when the studio dropped her contract warner bros picked it up 
and in 1932 gave her a costarring role as an ingenue in the man 
who played god 
it was the beginning of her 18year association with warner 
bros a sometimes stormy period in which miss davis was known for 
her famous quarrels with studio chief jack warner yet when warner 
was asked in later years to define the term movie star he said 
simply bette davis 
in 1934 miss davis was loaned to rko for the role that would 
establish her reputation as the sullen heroine mildred in of 
human bondage 
in the twilight of her career she played such television roles 
as a alice vanderbilt on little gloria happy at last and a 
terminally ill wife in right of way a 1983 madeforcable film 
costarring james stewart 
after appearing in the premiere of the abc series hotel for 
the 19831984 tv season she was hospitalized in june 1983 she had 
a mastectomy and nine days later suffered a stroke only months 
after being discharged from the hospital she broke a hip 
when she returned to acting in the 1985 madefortv movie 
murder with mirrors she said she was frightened she would no 
longer be able remember her lines and adjust to being on a set but 
she soon found it just great to be acting again 
her successful career was not matched in matters of love after 
four husbands she declared that she had failed and would never 
marry again when she wrote her autobiography she titled it the 
lonely life 
i havent been very fortunate i think its very difficult for 
a famous woman she told reporters in san sebastian 
in 1987 she published a second autobiography this n 
that which described her battle with medical problems and also 
delivered a rebuke to daughter barbara hymans unflattering 1985 
book my mothers keeper 
addressing her daughter in the book miss davis wrote the sum 
total of your having written this book is a glaring lack of loyalty 
and thanks for the very privileged life i feel you have been 
given 
in 1977 miss davis became the first woman to receive the 
american film institutes life achievement award and in 1987 she 
was a kennedy center honors winner 
she is survived by two adopted children michael merrill and 
margot merrill and a daughter barbara 
funeral arrangements were not immediately known

placards have been painted stirring 
speeches rehearsed riot police drilled and graphic photos mailed 
to state lawmakers for a legislative showdown on abortion but a 
state supreme court ruling last week may have preempted the 
purpose of the session 
legislators in other states such as pennsylvania are 
considering abortion bills as part of their regular sessions but 
floridas fourday special session beginning tuesday was supposed 
to offer a focused battleground on the emotioncharged issue 
its the first legislative special session on abortion scheduled 
to open since the us supreme courts july 3 ruling upholding 
missouri laws restricting abortion 
estimates of the number of activists coming for the session 
range up to 200000 or double the population of this picturesque 
city where the biggest excitement usually comes at florida state 
university and florida aampm football games 
the activists are expected to pump as much as 4 million into 
the local economy but as far as lawmaking the session may be a 
wash 
legislative leaders already reluctant to tackle abortion said 
the special session became a guaranteed waste of time and money 
with a thursday decision by the florida supreme court the court 
citing the state constitutions guarantee of privacy knocked down 
a 1988 parentalconsent law for minors seeking abortions 
its total chaos said state rep ben graber an 
obstetrician who performs abortions were heading into a session 
that was already vague and now its blurred obviously we are 
going to have constitutional problems with any bill 
legislative leaders say republican gov bob martinez who 
ordered the session should postpone it he rejects the idea and 
some say its possible that the legislature will come to order as 
required by law then adjourn without action 
in calling the special session martinez noted that the next 
60day regular session of the florida legislature isnt scheduled 
to begin until april 1990 thats too long to wait said the 
strongly antiabortion governor 
he proposed a package of abortion restrictions that include 
testing for fetus viability before abortions can be performed after 
the first trimester restricting abortions in publicly funded 
facilities and increasing state regulation of abortion clinics 
as the sessions opening approached state rep tom banjanin 
rpensacola described abortion rights advocates as not 
prochoice theyre prodeath 
rep elaine gordon dmiami beach countered we dont need 
zygote zealots that are worshiping at the altar of petrie dishes 
the heated rhetoric and the fact that the state has seen the 
bombings of several abortion clinics in recent years has officials 
taking extra security precautions 
the problem is we really dont know what to expect said 
tallahassee police sgt gary lassiter we dont know how 
different groups will react to different things 
the city police force trained a 40officer alpha force riot 
squad for potential widespread civil disobedience monitoring 
cameras were installed between state office buildings 
hopefully they will protect the publics right to speak and 
protect the legislators right to live said senate president bob 
crawford 
kenneth connor who heads the antiabortion group florida right 
to life is urging fellow activists to put our best foot 
forward the antiabortion side is expected to outnumber 
prochoice forces during the special session 
it would disserve the unborn for our people to engage in 
unseemly conduct connor said 
politicians say an already high volume of abortion mail has 
picked up steadily not just in amount but in shock value with 
political and personal threats and color photos of butchered 
fetuses 
antiabortion lawmakers have received hundreds of small handmade 
hangers along with some regular hangers symbolizing the 
prochoice sides contention that restricting abortion will spur 
unsafe illegal abortions 
martinez contended the session has already produced progress by 
raising discussion of an unborn childs rights 
opponents of martinez though say the firstterm governor has 
boosted efforts to unseat him in 1990 many polls indicate most 
floridians favor access to abortions feminist groups have pledged 
to rally women voters against martinez 
i think hes in a boxing match with a tar baby said ted 
phelps manager of the planned 1990 gubernatorial race of us rep 
bill nelson its an act of political grandstanding and hes 
digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole 
its not a question of being stubborn counters martinez 
whether or not something passes its not going to go away

lebanons christian lawmakers on 
saturday demanded guarantees of a syrian withdrawal from lebanon 
and christian leader gen michael aoun reportedly pressed for a 
pullout within six months 
the 63 legislators were meeting in this western mountain resort 
to try to end 14 years of civil war antisyrian sunni moslem 
legislators supported the christian pullout demands deepening the 
deadlock as the deliberations moved into their second week 
the maronite catholics the dominant christian sect in lebanon 
want a pledge for the withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops from 
lebanon before they will agree to political reforms that would give 
moslems an equal share of power 
the arab league which sponsored the conference has suggested a 
syrian withdrawal from moslem sectors of beirut within two years to 
the syriancontrolled bekaa valley in eastern lebanon after that 
damascus would negotiate on troop levels with a new lebanese 
government 
lebanon has been ruled by two rival governments one moslem and 
one christian since september 1988 
the syrianbacked moslems have insisted there can be no pullout 
until the christians agree to the reforms 
conference sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
aoun a maronite is pressing for a syrian pullout within six 
months 
a sunni moslem lawmaker abdulmajid rafie of the northern 
syriancontrolled port of tripoli told reporters that the syrians 
should at least withdraw from beirut before a parliamentary session 
scheduled there for later this month to elect a new lebanese 
president 
many lebanese sunnis oppose the syrian presence in their nation 
although they are powerless to do anything about it because they 
have no military muscle 
for the second straight day no formal sessions were scheduled 
saturday as arab league mediators sought to find a compromise to 
break the impasse 
conference sources said a full session of the 33 christian and 
30 moslem parliamentarians will not be held until a compromise is 
reached 
saudi arabian moroccan and algerian mediators who comprise the 
arab league committee on lebanon sought international support for 
compromise proposals and had intensive contacts with us soviet 
french and iraqi envoys the sources reported 
the soviet union is syrias main ally and also has close links 
with iraq france has historic links with the maronites 
iraq syrias main arab rival has been arming aoun to help him 
confront damascus in an attempt to thwart syrian ambitions in 
lebanon 
however all these outside powers have supported the arab 
leagues peacemaking effort 
syrian forces moved into lebanon in 1976 the year after the 
civil war broke out under a peacekeeping mandate by the 22member 
arab league 
aoun claims the syrians abrogated that mandate by openly siding 
with lebanons moslems 
the arab league peace plan announced last month hinges on the 
christians surrendering some of their privileges the christians 
have dominated the government parliament judiciary and army since 
independence from france in 1943 
along with a phased syrian withdrawal leading to a security pact 
between damascus and a united lebanese government the plan also 
calls for the withdrawal of israeli forces occupying a border strip 
in southern lebanon 
syria which considers lebanon to be vital to its strategic 
defense against israel has linked any troop withdrawal to an 
israeli pullout and political reforms 
most moslem lawmakers and some prosyrian christians favor the 
arab league blueprint 
they contend the syrians are the only force powerful enough to 
keep lebanons unruly militias in check and maintain order in the 
warravaged mediterranean country 
despite the differences the meeting has made some progress 
the lawmakers have agreed to divide seats in lebanons national 
assembly equally between the two sides since 1943 the christians 
have had a 65 edge 
they were considered to be the majority in 1943 but moslems now 
form an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million population 
the 99seat parliament was last elected in 1972 twentyfive 
legislators have died or been killed since then and former 
president amin gemayels seat has been vacant since he was elected 
in 1982 ten of the surviving legislators are not attending the

the food and drug administration wants a new 
york pharmaceutical manufacturer to recall an antibiotic used to 
treat urinary tract infections because it believes the company 
cheated on product safety tests an fda official said saturday 
an fda investigation found indications that bolar pharmaceutical 
co inc substituted the brandname product for its own in tests 
three years ago to win approval of its own generic product said 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit 
because of the evidence indicating a substitution it is not 
possible for the fda to assure whether the bolar product is 
therapeutically equivalent to the brandname product at this time 
nesbit said 
bolar based in copiague ny and the largest of the generic 
drug makers under fda scrutiny won approval for its generic 
version of the drug nitrofurantoin in june 1988 
bolars product is the only generic drug approved as 
therapeutically equivalent to macrodantin made by norwicheaton 
pharmaceuticals currently on the market although other dosage 
forms of nitrofurantoin are available 
though the fda wants to remove bolars drug from the market it 
has not asked people taking the generic medication to switch to the 
brandname product 
the fda does not have the authority to remove a product from the 
market if a company does not comply with an fda recall request 
the agency can only force a recall in court 
the washington post in saturday editions quoted bolar president 
robert shulman as saying the company would investigate 
extenuating circumstances surrounding the drug over the weekend 
and decide by early this week whether to recall the product 
telephone calls to bolars headquarters were not answered on 
saturday 
the post quoted shulman as saying there is no difference 
between the drug that was tested and bolars version of 
nitrofurantoin on the market he said the company will look at the 
matter and added that there are circumstances surrounding the 
manufacturer and testing of this product that the fda is not 
aware of 
the fda is also trying to remove from the market bolars version 
of the popular highbloodpressure drug dyazide because of 
questions about whether the companys product is therapeutically 
equivalent to the brandname drug the fda is investigating whether 
bolar switched samples of the brandname product with its own in 
safety tests to win approval 
the post quoted unidentified federal officials as saying bolar 
is also under criminal investigation regarding data it submitted to 
the fda concerning its version of dyazide 
the fda is also investigating another alleged incident of 
productswitching by bolar involving an antipsychotic drug it was 
developing in 1982 bolar officials have said the incident was a 
manufacturing error and that the version of thioridazine involved 
was never marketed 
the fda is investigating more than a dozen generic drug 
companies in the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption within 
the industry and fdas generic drug division 
one of them vitarine pharmaceutical inc of springfield 
gardens ny has admitted to using the same tactic the fda is 
accusing bolar of using 
vitarine halted distribution of its dyazide copy in the summer 
after admitting it had substituted samples of the brandname drug 
for its own in tests required for fda approval

a gallery owner has put together an art exhibit 
that offers something to offend just about everyone including 
works by two artists who outraged sen jesse helms and led to the 
bill just passed in congress 
greg kucera assembled the 20artist show called taboo with 
his own money saying people have a right to see these works of 
art 
we live in a world where diversity of opinion gives this 
culture its richness kucera said without the right to examine 
controversial and sometimes disturbing works of art we would be 
fascists 
many if not most of the works would presumeably not be eligible 
to receive public funds from the national endowment for the arts 
and the national endowment for the humanities under a bill approved 
by the senate on saturday after passing the house of 
representatives earlier in the week the bill gives officials the 
power to deny grant money to artworks they deem obscene 
kuceras show includes works by two artists who angered some 
lawmakers most notably helms the north carolina republican who 
led the effort to prohibit federal aid for art he considers 
offensive 
helms noted the national endowment for the arts had spent 
45000 to back an exhibit by andres serrano which featured a 
photograph titled piss christ of a crucifix in what is 
allegedly urine and by the late robert mapplethorpe whose 
photographs depict homosexual acts and children in explicit poses 
helms proposal sought to prohibit federal aid for obscene 
or indecent art and for works offensive to a religion ethnic or 
age group race or the disabled 
a compromise version approved by the house and now before the 
senate would bar the endowments from issuing grants for 
exhibitions considered obscene including works depicting 
sadomasochism homoeroticism sexual exploitation of children or 
people involved in sex acts officials would also have to find the 
work lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific 
value 
serranos piss christ and some works by mapplethorpe are 
included in kuceras show which opened thursday and runs through 
oct 29 
kucera said about 1000 people five times the normal number 
showed up opening night and that the catalog is selling briskly 
kucera boarded up the plate glass windows in his small 
storefront gallery before the opening and hired a private security 
guard but by late friday only one protester had appeared 
the artists in the exhibit all have found themselves the subject 
of controversy at one time or another kucera says 
it includes a crucified mickey mouse titled homage to jim 
bakker by a winstonsalem nc artist who goes by the name 
richard c other religious themes are the late howard kottlers 
bar mitzvah boy a plate featuring a portrait of a pope and 
athens ga artist bill pauls bound and nailedshut bible 
photographs of sometimes naked bloodied or bruised children in 
the exhibit are lexington va artist sally manns own children 
and the bruises and bloody noses were the result of the usual 
childhood horseplay kucera said

the justice department is defending attorney 
general dick thornburghs use of government aircraft for private 
travel including a trip to a convention in hawaii aboard a boeing 
727 in which he and five assistants were the only passengers 
david runkel a spokesman for thornburgh said the federal 
bureau of investigation has determined that for his personal 
security and the security of his communications that he should 
travel by government airplane 
the fbi is a branch of the justice department which thornburgh 
heads 
runkel said thornburgh was surprised however to learn that the 
only government aircraft for the hawaii trip was a 727 a large 
commercialsized jet used by the us marshals service to fly 
prisoners around the country 
he thought that it was bizarre when he got inside the plane 
but the 727 was the only plane available that could get him 
there runkel said 
the flight from san francisco to honolulu cost the government 
38000 according to a report saturday in the new york times the 
paper said it had examined records showing that thornburghs 48 
trips in the last year cost taxpayers 191000 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
is looking into the trips the paper reported 
more than a year ago thornburgh restricted governmentpaid 
travel by justice department employees to trips directly related to 
the job conventions such as the trip to hawaii are among the 
peopletopeople type exchanges that were ruled out 
former attorney general edwin meese iii had been criticized for 
his travels including a trip to a legal symposium with five other 
department officials in japan meese usually took commercial 
flights 
runkel said thornburgh would not have flown the 727 except that 
another plane had broken down 
but a letter from the marshals service also an arm of the 
justice department said the jet had been requested six weeks 
before the hawaii trip the times reported 
a unidentified fbi official told the times that the hawaii leg 
of the trip cost 38000 a firstclass roundtrip ticket between 
san francisco and honolulu costs about 1400

the senate gave final congressional approval 
saturday to putting strings on government aid to the arts by giving 
officials the power to deny grant money for works they believe may 
be obscene 
in a weekend session called to tackle pressing budgetary 
matters the senate sent president bush a spending bill containing 
the art limitations on a 916 vote bush is expected to sign the 
measure 
the house four days ago voted 38141 to adopt the same spending 
measure a compromise fashioned by a housesenate conference 
committee 
the funding prohibition which constitutional lawyers say 
appears to be the first restriction on federal art assistance based 
on content also was a compromise conservatives wanted a stricter 
ban while liberals argued that any limits would inhibit artists 
the bill forbids the national endowment for the arts and the 
national endowment for the humanities to finance works that 
endowment officials believe may be considered obscene it 
specifically precludes subsidies for art depicting sadomasochism 
homoeroticism child exploitation or sex acts between people 
to deny the money however those officials would also have to 
conclude that a work lacked serious literary artistic political 
or scientific value 
final passage came as sen jesse helms rnc lost a 
lastditch fight to toughen the restrictions the senate rejected 
6235 his proposal to add prohibitions against federal aid for art 
that depicts in a patently offensive way sexual or excretory 
activities or organs they then adopted the art restrictions in 
the bill on a voice vote 
helms argued that the government should not subsidize art that 
many people find offensive and that his proposal using language 
from a supreme court decision would prevent that 
no artist no citizen has a right to intrude into taxpayers 
pockets helms said 
critics of the helms restrictions said they would amount to 
censorship and noted that only about 20 of 85000 federal arts 
grants have caused major controversy over the years 
in a free society we must not yield to the appeals of the 
knownothings said sen edward kennedy dmass we must not 
embrace the calls for censorship 
when the fight began last summer helms had sought to ban 
government assistance for obscene or indecent art including 
portrayals of sadomasochism homoeroticism child exploitation and 
sexual acts between people he also wanted to bar federal grants 
for works that belittle any religion race ethnic group age group 
or handicap 
current federal law permits the national endowment for the arts 
to finance projects that in the experts view foster excellence 
are reflective of exceptional talent and have significant 
literary scholarly cultural or artistic merit 
conservative crticism earlier this year of two federally backed 
arts exhibits sparked action in congress the endowment spent 
15000 for a show that featured an andres serrano photograph of a 
crucifix in urine and 30000 to display photographs by the late 
robert mapplethorpe that pictured children in suggestive poses and 
homosexual acts 
house liberals thwarted a conservative effort last summer to 
eliminate or severely slash the endowments 170 million budget 
because of the exhibitions settling for a symbolic 45000 cut in 
the agencys financing for this year 
the senate however adopted helms original provision on a july 
26 voice vote toning it down in another vote sept 29 
many lawmakers complained that the controversy left them in a 
politically ticklish position vote for the restrictions or be left 
vulnerable to electionyear charges of supporting federally 
financed pornography with conservatives aggressively pursuing 
strong restrictions liberals were pressured into accepting 
limitations in some form 
the restrictions are to last one year a commission established 
by the legislation will study the endowments decisionmaking in 
awarding grants and whether standards for qualifying works are 
needed 
the endowment is also ordered to give congress a 30day warning 
if funds will be granted to the southeastern center for 
contemporary art in winstonsalem nc which showed the serrano 
picture and the institute for contemporary art at the university 
of pennsylvania which exhibited the mapplethorpe photographs 
the 112 billion measure for the interior department cultural 
and other programs is for fiscal 1990 which began sunday 
the legislation also extends for another year a ban on the 
leasing of offshore tracts for oil and gas drilling imposes new 
restrictions on lobbyists who seek federal money for clients and 
allows lumber companies to cut timber on federally owned land in 
the northwest while protecting areas inhabited by the rare spotted 
owl 
voting against final passage of the spending bill were wyche 
fowler dga howell heflin dala jesse helms rnc gordon

the senate sent compromise legislation to 
president bush on saturday that would free up sales of timber from 
oldgrowth federal forests in the northwest while protecting the 
habitat of the spotted owl 
on a 916 vote the senate gave final congressional approval to 
an 112 billion spending measure for land and cultural programs 
for fiscal 1990 that contained the lumber provisions bush is 
expected to sign the measure which is for the fiscal year that 
began last sunday 
the legislation also includes new restrictions on lobbyists a 
continued moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling and limits 
on federal subsidies to art considered obscene 
there was no separate vote saturday on the forestry language 
which was worked out a week ago by housesenate negotiators the 
senate was working over the weekend on budget legislation 
disputes over logging federallyowned tracts in the northwest 
have raged for years environmentalists argue that rare spotted 
owls and the virgin forests they inhabit must be preserved while 
timber interests and others say felling the trees creates jobs and 
boosts the regions economy 
our state is not about to be clear cut from corner to 
corner sen slade gorton rwash said saturday 
our national forests belong to the many countered sen 
wyche fowler dga they are not private tree farms for the few 
gorton ended up voting for the compromise measure 
the compromise legislation allows 96 billion board feet of 
timber to be sold in the regions federal forests this fiscal year 
it strengthens legal protections for the owls while requiring 
environmentalists to let some timber sales now blocked by court 
order to proceed 
restrictions are also placed on the extent of legal challenges 
by environmentalists seeking to halt future sales 
the bill which the house approved 38141 last tuesday extends 
for another year prohibitions on leasing and drilling off alaska 
california florida and much of the northeast 
preleasing studies in waters off the california coast would 
also be prohibited for the first five months of 1990 giving 
drilling foes additional time to try to block future work 
lobbyists who try to win federal monies for their clients would 
be forbidden from being paid with those tax dollars lobbyists 
whose contracts exceed 100000 would have to file periodic reports 
with congress on their activities fines between 10000 and 
100000 could be levied on violators 
federal art grants would also be withheld from works that 
officials believe is obscene and that lack serious artistic value

editors note veteran ap entertainment reporter bob thomas 
first interviewed miss davis 45 years ago his memory of that 
meeting and several others follow 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
remembering bette davis she never changed 
when this reporter first met bette davis 45 years ago she was 
full of yankee spunk fiercely independent at war with jack 
warner in an interview last april she was frail but ever 
challenging at war with the world 
one of the first meetings came when miss davis returned to 
warner bros after the birth of her daughter 
a woman is never a complete woman until she has become a 
mother miss davis proclaimed she may have had second thoughts 
40 years later when the same daughter wrote a book attacking her 
in 1949 miss davis was filming the fateful beyond the 
forest her last film under contract to warner bros she always 
had something to rail about and this time it was the industrys 
selfcensorship 
hollywood tries to combine entertainment for both kids and 
adults in the same picture miss davis said the result is a 
movie which isnt suitable for either seventeen years later the 
industry followed her hint and establish the rating system 
in 1961 miss davis had just divorced her fourth husband gary 
merrill and was back in hollywood making a pocketful of 
miracles with director frank capra she continued her outspoken 
tradition 
i dont think marriage can work not for career women she 
declared god knows ive tried its too bad it wont work 
because i like men i just cant stay married to them she kept 
her vow never to marry again 
miss davis had returned to the stage in 1962 touring in an 
evening with carl sandburg she explained 
i sat around here for a year and didnt get a call from the 
studios oh yes i had a chance to play burt lancasters mother in 
a picture they made in mexico ill be damned if ill play burt 
lancasters mother after 30 years in this business 
in 1963 miss davis was gloating over the success of whatever 
happened to baby jane after it had been turned down by every 
studio boss including jack warner 
oh they simply kill me she said with a wicked glint in her 
eye they couldnt understand the pictures success it had to 
be a freak oh if they could only learn its still names that 
sell movies names that have established a reputation with the 
public by past performances not the socalled names who are used 
in picture after picture even though they cant draw flies at the 
box office 
miss davis became the fifth recipient of the american film 
institutes lifetime achievement award in 1977 i suppose after 
four men she said they decided lets give it to a dame 
at 68 she seemed in exuberant good health but she admitted 
after 48 years in the acting business you begin to wonder is 
it possible youre still alive 
later in 1977 miss davis was in luxor egypt filming death 
on the nile with an allstar cast characteristically she did 
not reside at a modern hotel with the rest of the cast and crew 
she occupied a grand suite at the old winter palace with a sweeping 
view of the nile and the valley of the kings 
she grumbled about being on the remote location when i was at 
warners i was never off the lot never they built everything on 
the back lot from a welsh village the corn is green to the 
petrified forest i defy you to tell the difference from the real 
thing 
in april 1989 at her apartment in west hollywood she was a 
frail presence a stroke and a mastectomy had taken their toll and 
she seemed painfully thin but her voice still crackled with 
nononsense authority 
she summed up her contentious lifetime as stated on a small 
needlepoint pillow that read no guts no glory 
oh yes its the truth to dare to be hated that takes 
guts

the party leaderships commitment to free elections by june at 
the latest along with the acceptance of international human rights 
provisions had put hungary in the forefront of reform within the 
warsaw pact alliance even before saturdays vote 
only poland with the soviet blocs first government not 
controlled by communists has come as far as hungary in its 
democratic strivings 
the new party which draws on socialist and communist ideals 
supports humanism freedom and democracy the document stated 
it seeks alliances with reformoriented communist parties as well 
as socialist and social democratic parties according to the 
resolution 
liberals grouped in the reform union faction had urged since the 
congress opened friday that the new party be free of communist 
party conservatives however in a clear attempt to gain broad 
support the position paper avoided direct mention of cleansing of 
ranks 
it instead called into its ranks all those who agree with its 
platform who accept the ground rules but the document also 
provided that members of the old party would not automatically be 
members of the new one by proposing that new membership booklets be 
issued by nov 10 
originally even more wideranging in its intention to split with 
the past the reform leadership watered down the document late 
saturday to gain the support of the peoples democratic forum 
less progressive than the reform union but more liberal than the 
conservative groupings 
members of the two liberal factions debated passionately 
yelling could be heard from a conference hall at one point before 
agreement was reached on the compromise document 
the document declared the new party would support the concept of 
private and state property calling for a mixed property social 
market economy and the development of a multiparty 
parliamentary democracy 
communisat party chairman rezsoe nyers a moderate reformer 
appointed in an attempt to bridge ideological differences among the 
fourmember party leadership praised the position paper as a 
compromise serving the rebirth of our party as a new leftwing 
socialist party 
in a surprise turn nyers disclosed that former politburo member 
janos berecz one of the most bitter opponents of reform at the 
congress had asked whether there was room for him in the new party 
i said yes as a reform communist nyers said to cheers 
from some of the delegates 
earlier in the day berecz had suggested he was ready to be 
sacrificed for his communist ideals and said the rankandfile 
membership would not stand for substantive change 
you can tie me to a stake but you cant do that to the 
720000 party members represented by the delegates he said to 
scattered boos and whistles 
the strong approval of the document was a blow to conservatives 
at the congress who had supported plans to make some changes in the 
existing party but rejected founding a new one 
berecz who had lost his politburo post in recent party 
infighting had spoken bitterly of his liberal rivals earlier 
saturday 
i want to conserve my communist past he declared adding 
that differences with imre pozsgay the leading reformer in the 
fourman party leadership truly put us in different parties 
pozsgay the party candidate for the newly created government 
post of president in the planned elections had told reporters 
earlier he was closer to social democratic ideals than traditional 
communist ones which he said led to a dead end in eastern 
europe wherever they were tried 
he described soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs campaign 
for restructuring and openness as an encouraging wind for our 
reforms but emphasized that hungarys decisions were independent 
of other countries 
premier miklos nemeth also a reformer and member of the 
collective party leadership told the delegates that the new party 
would have no room for those who have blood on their hands from 
past communist party excesses 
another test of reform and conservative strength at the congress 
was expected sunday in voting on leadership posts 
reformers with nearly 500 committed delegates represent the 
strongest faction at the congress with staunch conservatives 
numbering less than 100 
but several reformers said the conservatives were continuing 
efforts to win over the more than 700 publicly uncomitted delegates

thousands of soviets marched in an icy drizzle to 
the walls of the kremlin on saturday in a show of support for boris 
n yeltsin and two other parliamentarians they say are threatened 
by communist party bosses 
yeltsin gdlyan ivanov they are our conscience read one 
sign supporting the parliamentarians that was carried by a 
protester down gorky street moscows most fashionable shopping 
thoroughfare as thick crowds looked on 
demonstrators also opposed the monopoly on political power by 
the communist party and sought establishment of a westernstyle 
democracy the protest on constitution day a soviet holiday also 
demanded that civil and human rights outlined in the 1977 soviet 
constitution be scrupulously observed 
under president mikhail s gorbachev a lawyer by training the 
kremlin has acknowledged that constitutionally protected freedoms 
of speech assembly and others have been neglected or violated 
outright in the past it also ordered a rewrite of the 
constitution with gorbachev himself in charge 
as a cold rain fell thousands of members and sympathizers of 
the grassroots prodemocracy russian peoples front linked hands 
to form a human chain whose sections stretched for miles along the 
center of gorky street the artery leading from moscows heart to 
its northwest suburbs 
knots of demonstrators were seen along the road as far away as 
sheremetyevo moscows international airport 20 miles from the 
kremlin 
although it was not possible to count the participants they 
were far fewer than than more than 1 million residents of estonia 
latvia and lithuania who formed a human chain aug 23 to denounce 
the 1939 nazisoviet pact that consigned their once independent 
homelands to the kremlin orbit 
eyes streaming and noses running from the cold the 
demonstrators stood single file blocking the lane of gorky street 
reserved for limousines of the state and party elite many shouted 
opposition to the ruling 20million member communist party and 
some even waved the once banned white blue and red tricolor of 
czarist russia 
the communist party is a mafia the first mafia in the 
history of the world to take power said one protester retiree 
valery kazakov from the southern russian city of rostovondon 
the main thing is to find out who is actually behind that mafia 
the protest occurred while gorbachev was in east germany to 
attend ceremonies marking the countrys 40th anniversary 
the three members of the congress of peoples deputies the 
protesters defended have earned fame and widespread support by 
noisily fighting party bosses 
the strapping rubberfaced yeltsin is the bestknown example he 
first got in trouble with gorbachev for claiming the presidents 
program of economic and political reforms was being implemented too 
slowly and was fired as moscow party boss in november 1987 
yeltsin 58 staged a spectacular political comeback this spring 
by winning election to the congress from moscow with 89 percent of 
the vote over party opposition last month he came under attack in 
the party daily pravda for allegedly going on a drinking and 
shopping binge while visiting the united states 
pravda later apologized to yeltsin saying the charges 
contained in an italian newspaper article it reprinted without 
comment could not be substantiated but to soviets the affair was 
more evidence that party potentates were out to get the maverick 
communist who has opposed privileges received by the party elite 
and called for a better life for the average soviet 
pravda is not the truth proclaimed a sign worn by one 
yeltsin supporter near the kremlin a woman in a white ski cap 
made a bonfire from a wad of pravdas saturday newspapers 
prosecutors telman gdlyan and nikolai ivanov alleged corruption 
at the partys top levels involving yegor k ligachev the siberian 
widely thought to be gorbachevs conservative nemesis on the ruling 
politburo last month the partys central committee ordered the 
two held accountable for leveling groundless charges 
all the hubbub around these brave men is a disgrace for a 
great country said tatyana tarasova 40 a producer of cartoons 
there is such a scandalous quantity of lies nearby other 
protesters chanted hands off gdlyan and ivanov 
breaking the human chain after about 1 hours about 3000 
demonstrators marched to a square near the kremlins high redbrick 
walls 
democracy democracy hundreds chanted as they passed 
moscows city hall others shouted down with article 6 the 
constitutional provision defining the communist partys role as the 
leading force in society

a march by white supremacists saturday in 
the birthplace of the ku klux klan attracted its largest audience 
from police who presided over a gathering that was peaceful if 
not quiet 
this is what the scum of america tried to prevent for 60 
days said the rev richard g butler pastor of the church of 
jesus christ christianaryan nations 
about 200 members of the hayden lake idaho organization and 
various ku klux klan and skinhead groups marched to honor sam 
davis a civil war hero of the confederacy who was executed by 
union forces here 
the klan was founded in the town about 70 miles southwest of 
nashville after the civil war though the modern klan traces its 
roots to another branch founded in georgia 
town leaders said the group could not be denied a permit to 
gather and the community responded with a campaign to close 
businesses in the town of 7600 for the day residents also put up 
orange ribbons symbolizing brotherhood and a wreath of orange 
ribbons in the hands of a statue of davis on the town square 
most businesses did opt to close police chief stanley newton 
said 
theres not a soul out anywere he said saturday morning a 
few hours before the supremacists arrived youd think it was a 
ghost town 
robert lawson the states commissioner of public safety said 
100 state police 100 local officers and from 60 to 100 
intelligence officers from agencies outside the state monitored the 
march 
about 40 state troopers with riot helmets and batons stood by 
and a police helicopter circled overhead 
there was no counterdemonstration although after louis beam of 
the aryan nations led the marchers in three chants of hail sam 
davis someone in the crowd of about 100 spectators responded 
with the hail with you 
police blocked off all streets leading to the square and kept 
the curious off the street as the marchers led by two skinhead 
drummers marched by chanting white power hail victory 
and other slogans 
many of the racists carried confederate flags and wore klan 
robes or militarystyle uniforms bearing nazi and klan insignia 
the group marched around the courthouse heard two speeches 
marched once more around the square and returned to their cars 
about a half hour after the demonstration began 
plainclothes police videotaped the rally and wrote down the 
license plate numbers of some marchers 
larry whitlock a special agent for the georgia bureau of 
investigation was observing for the agencys antiterrorist squad 
i was surprised this is the first time the aryan nations has 
put on something like this away from hayden lake whitlock said 
i would have thought they would have got a lot more support out 
of the klan up here 
diana kirkpatrick who watched part of the rally with her 
husband and 16monthold son said the town overreacted by closing 
businesses for the day 
if they hadnt done that it wouldnt have been such a big 
deal she said they got the whole town scared 
typical of those who marched was randal smith of dallas ga who 
carried a business card that described him as grand dragon of the 
southern white knights of the ku klux klan 
smith said about 30 members of his group were attending the 
march and complained that if a civil rights group had marched 
the town would be wide open the welcome mats out

the prudence island school probably has 
the fastest and most orderly fire drills in rhode island if not 
the world and why not a 6yearold and two 5yearolds make up 
the entire student body 
shannon cubellis and daniel jenness both 5yearold 
kindergartners and firstgrader ethel flynn 6 quickly lined up 
and marched behind teacher elizabeth hambly when the fire alarm 
buzzed on a recent day 
they congregated calmly at the end of the schools driveway 
until it was time to return to class 
ethel was the first one to school that day bounding in seven 
minutes before class started at 9 am as the first she got to 
ring the schools bell tugging on the rope 13 times 
the girl beamed when hambly admired her denim dress and purple 
sweater 
you look beautiful the teacher said 
the 93yearold school on the island linked to portsmouth by 
ferry was closed six years ago because there werent enough 
students the islands older children take the 30minute ferry ride 
into portsmouth to attend middle and high schools but parents of 
elementarylevel children opted to teach them at home rather than 
put them on the ferry at such tender ages 
portsmouth school superintendent mario mancieri said parents 
finally persuaded him to reopen the school about a month ago 
my first reaction was we have a ferry service avail 
yourself of that he said then we started talking about young 
children someone asked me how would you like to put a 5yearold 
on a ferry every morning i started thinking about that 
hambly 27 drives five miles from her home in portsmouth to 
catch the ferry in bristol each school day 
once off the boat hambly hops into a car provided by the school 
department she drives about a mile down a narrow winding road 
lined with old cars and quaint cottages and summer homes to the 
schoolhouse 
prudence island with a permanent population of about 200 is 
part of the town of portsmouth 
mancieri said he realized the money that would be spent to 
transport younger children from the island to portsmouth could be 
used to reopen the schoolhouse 
he said it would have cost the school district about 35000 a 
year to ship the three students to the mainland on special 
300atrip ferry runs not on the boats normal schedule 
instead the portsmouth school department spent between 20000 
and 30000 to make over the islands school building including 
asbestos removal smoke alarms and new paint 
shannon and daniel the kindergartners get out of school at 
1230 pm while ethel remains until 330 pm she doesnt seem to 
mind that the boys are free to go home early and play 
after they leave i have some lunch and then i do some of my 
work she said 
hambly said her school would get at least one more student in 
two years but until then unless someone moves to the island with 
a youngster its just going to be the four of them and to make 
sure the students dont miss out on making friends therell be 
periodic visits to other schools 
other teachers couldnt get to know their students as well as 
im going to get to know these three hambly said theres more 
onetoone teaching and learning 
hambly after only a month on the job has three loyal fans in 
her students 
shannon wants to be a telephone repairman when he grows up and 
daniel wants to be a fireman daniel would have to move off the 
island because firefighters here are volunteers and he wants to 
make money 
ethel said she wants to be a teacher 
just like ms hambly she said

the army saturday barred 700 
israeli peace activists from entering an arab town to talk with 
palestinians 
in the occupied gaza strip israeli troops shot and wounded 
seven palestinians authorities said 
at least 585 palestinains have been killed and more than 12000 
wounded in the 21monthold uprising against israeli rule of the 
occupied territories forty israelis have died in the violence and 
127 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs on suspicion of 
cooperating with israel 
an army spokesman said the west bank town of tulkarem where the 
peace meeting was scheduled between palestinians and the israeli 
activists was a closed military area and that only residents 
were permitted to enter 
the spokesman who could not be identified under standing 
regulations said defense minister yitzhak rabin had refused to 
grant permission to the leftwing peace now group to enter the 
palestinian town of about 50000 22 miles northeast of tel aviv 
he refused to elaborate 
the peace activists many waving banners reading talk peace 
with the plo now held a demonstration at roadblocks outside the 
town they were joined by two leftwing members of parliament and 
faisal husseini a leading palestinian activist 
we all know that israelis could talk with palestinians if the 
roadblocks between us were removed husseini said 
i want to tell you that we palestinians have paid a heavy 
price and will continue to do so until the forces of peace will 
win husseini said in arabic his remarks were simultaneously 
translated into hebrew 
dedi zucker a leftwing legislator from the citizens rights 
movement said we must do all we can for peace now so we dont 
have to attend funerals later 
yael dayan daughter of israeli war hero moshe dayan greeted 
husseini and said she brought a message of peace 
husseinis father and my father fought each other in the 
past she said i hope my childen and those of husseini will 
live together in peace 
moshe dayan served as defense minster during the 1967 middle 
east war when israels armies seized the west bank from jordan and 
the gaza strip from egypt 
husseinis father abdel qader commanded a palestinian force of 
irregulars during the 1948 middle east war he was killed in a 
battle for jerusalem 
after the demonstration a few leaders of peace now were able to 
slip into tulkarem where they met with mayor hilmi hanoun 
the leaders who asked not to be identified quoted hanoun as 
saying the moment a palestinian state is born we will have 
peace

the 20 million campaign for governor of 
virginia has produced a whos who list of celebrity givers 
from entertainer bill cosby to former white house chief of staff 
donald regan 
even some news media names are listed on campaign finance 
reports of those who have pumped money into the race between 
democrat l douglas wilder the states lieutenant governor and 
republican j marshall coleman a former virginia attorney general 
one is ed bradley of the cbs news program 60 minutes who 
gave 500 to wilder in his bid to become the nations first elected 
black governor 
i look upon this as part of my life as a private citizen 
said bradley who met wilder at a fundraiser in new york and 
liked what he had to say 
bradley said he has contributed to other candidates and while 
has had some concerns about the potential conflict in reporting the 
news and giving money to political campaigns the alternative is 
to do nothing 
i dont advertise it but i dont hide it he said its a 
delicate line you tread 
when it comes to drawing money from the famous wilder has more 
names than coleman most of the gifts are small with the exception 
of cosby who gave 100000 to wilder 
but other wellknown contributors to the democrats campaign 
have given far less they include singer barbra streisand who gave 
1000 former tennis star arthur ashe jr like wilder a richmond 
native who gave 3000 and charlayne hunter gault of the 
macneillehrer newshour on public broadcasting stations who gave

in addition to regan a top aide to former president reagan who 
gave 10000 they include president bushs son marvin who

and wilder 
in all coleman has raised 82 million to 48 million for 
wilder

a congress of latvian activists on 
saturday debated plans for independence from the soviet union 
despite fears the kremlin might impose an economic blockade in 
retaliation 
while red hammerandsickle flags fluttered over riga for the 
national holiday known as soviet constitution day the 1074 
delegates of the peoples front of latvia considered a program that 
denounced the soviet system as feudal the plan calls for a 
free market economy based on private property and profit 
the last half century has seen the rule of an absurd economic 
system the absence of human rights and an administrative 
arbitrariness which has led latvia to national economic and 
ecological catastrophes the movements draft plan said 
the program is a 126point list of goals aimed at building an 
independent economy and social structure in latvia before it would 
secede from the soviet union 
it calls for human rights competing political parties private 
business and an end to communist party domination 
it also demands an end to discrimination against intellectuals 
abolition of privileges in the distribution of scarce apartments 
and food and restoration of latvian geographical names 
peoples front president dainis ivans said the program faces 
strong opposition especially from radicals who are registering 
latvians to vote for an alternative parliament that would quickly 
declare independence 
he said the delegates to the congress represent 300000 
supporters of the peoples front 
the centrist draft program under debate saturday sets no 
date for independence and conforms in many ways to the reforms of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
for example gorbachev has backed economic independence for the 
baltic states which also include estonia and lithuania to both 
appease activists and advance reform of the soviet economy 
the program also avoids the popular street slogan in riga the 
latvian capital that demands removal of the soviet occupation 
army instead the popular front calls for the demilitarization of 
latvia 
ivans and other leaders spoke agains any abrupt declaration of 
independence we all know that no empire has given up its loot of 
its free will he said 
if the soviet union should try to blockade latvia economically 
to pressure it back into the fold latvia could lose the majority 
of its energy supplies including all of its gasoline economist 
arnmis kalnins told the delegates it could also forfeit 38 percent 
of its consumer goods he said 
the political situation doesnt show western countries would 
be willing to give support at the risk of offending the soviet 
union he added 
the congress expected to end with a vote on the independence 
platform sunday evening was businesslike in comparison with the 
euphoria of the peoples fronts first congress one year ago 
at that time 150000 people jammed a park outside the communist 
partys house of political education to weep in joy at the sound of 
onceforbidden folk songs and at the sight of the flag of 
onceindependent latvia 
during the past year the latvian parliament has passed measures 
claiming the right to veto soviet laws making latvian the official 
language and restoring minority schools 
estonia and lithuania also have pressed for increased autonomy 
during the past year 
at last years congress however the latvian activists made 
calls only for an illdefined sovereignty rather than 
independence from moscow 
on saturday latvian president anatoly gorbunov a close 
associate of gorbachev told reporters he was not disturbed by the 
new calls for independence because the proposal was offered in a 
democratic manner 
but he said he will oppose parts of the program concerning the 
path to independence and local control 
speaking of latvian independence he said at the present time 
there are neither the social nor economic preconditions

consumers can save close to 150 a year by 
using the most energy efficient appliances sold in the united 
states according to a independent nonprofit energy research group 
there are many factors that consumers need to look at in 
purchasing appliances energy is one of them said steve nadel 
senior associate at the american council for an energyefficient 
economy 
since onethird of the electricity produced in the us is 
consumed in our homes the council recommends consumers pay closer 
attention to the yellow energyguide labels affixed to new 
appliances 
we are suggesting that people narrow their searches nadel 
said the groups guide the most energyefficient appliances 
offers consumers help in doing that 
if all the households in the us had the most efficient 
refrigerators currently available the electricity savings would 
eliminate the need for about 10 large power plants the report 
said 
the makes and models surveyed by the council meet or exceed the 
minimum efficiency standards established by the national appliance 
energy conservation act of 1987 nadel added 
the law provides that minimum energy efficiency standards for 
major home appliances be reduced by 10 percent to 30 percent and 
phased in over five years 
using appliances and heating and cooling equipment costs an 
average household more than 1000 per year the report said 
we estimate that these standards will save consumers at least 
28 billion over the lifetimes of the products sold through the 
year 2000 the report concluded 
the council study assumes electic water heating so in homes 
with gas water heating since gas is typically less expensive the 
savings would be lower nadel added 
however nadel estimated buying the councils most 
energyefficient refrigerator dish and clothes washer could save 
146 a year 
the average family refrigerator is 185 cubic feet refrigerators 
with top freezers and automatic defrosters nadel said 
the council report rates a frigidaire 186 cubic feet model as 
the most efficient in that size category based on a national 
average energy cost of 77 cents per kilowatt hour the booklet 
estimates the annual cost to run the frigidaire refrigerator at 65 
annually 
the average refrigerator that consumers replace costs about 112 
to operate yearly said nadel he calculated that consumers would 
save 47 a year with the frigidaire model 
for two other common household appliances dish and clothes 
washers nadel estimated yearly costs for existing models in most 
homes at 70 and 90 respectively 
the council rates a whitewestinghouse dishwasher which costs 
38 a year to operate and a gibson frontloading standard size 
washing machine costing 23 a year to run as the most 
energyefficient new models the consumer buying these would save 
32 and 67 over current costs 
the council examined less than 5 percent of the different models 
available by july 1989 of refrigerators freezers dish and clothes 
washers tank and heat pump water heaters and room and central air 
conditioners 
the report said consumer savings might be increased further by 
utility company rebates to users of high efficiency appliances

a historic communist party congress on 
saturday overwhelmingly approved scrapping the 70yearold party 
and replacing it with a socialist organization it marked the first 
time a sovietbloc communist party has dissolved itself 
the resolution presented to the congress stated that the partys 
history has ended and named its successor the hungarian 
socialist party the new party is to resemble the socialist parties 
of west europe its founders said 
of the 1202 delegates present 1005 voted for the motion 
there were 159 votes against and 38 abstentions 
reform communists have for months urged the party to support 
their plan to start anew as hungary prepares for its first free 
national elections in 41 years 
the reformers have pointed to shrinking membership more than 
70000 party members have quit this year alone and a series of 
byelection losses to newly permited opposition parties in arguing 
that only a new democraticleftist party can compete successfully 
at the polls 
the party leaderships commitment to free elections by june at 
the latest along with the acceptance of international human rights 
provisions had put hungary in the forefront of reform within the 
warsaw pact alliance even before saturdays vote 
only poland with the soviet blocs first government not 
controlled by communists has come as far as hungary in its 
democratic strivings 
the new party which draws on socialist and communist ideals 
supports humanism freedom and democracy the document stated 
it seeks alliances with reformoriented communist parties as well 
as socialist and social democratic parties according to the 
resolution 
liberals grouped in the reform union faction had urged since the 
congress opened friday that the new party be free of communist 
party conservatives however in a clear attempt to gain broad 
support the position paper avoided direct mention of cleansing of 
ranks 
it instead called into its ranks all those who agree with its 
platform who accept the ground rules but the document also 
provided that members of the old party would not automatically be 
members of the new one by proposing that new membership booklets be 
issued by nov 10 
originally even more wideranging in its intention to split with 
the past the reform leadership watered down the document late 
saturday to gain the support of the platform for rural equal 
opportunity less progressive than the reform union but more 
liberal than the conservative groupings 
members of the two liberal factions debated passionately 
yelling could be heard from a conference hall at one point before 
agreement was reached on the compromise document 
the document declared the new party would support the concept of 
both private and state property calling for a mixed property 
social market economy and the development of a multiparty 
parliamentary democracy 
politburo member janos barabas told reporters the change would 
not challenge hungarys ties with more orthodox communist parties 
in other warsaw pact countries with whom we are in an alliance 
situation 
communist party chairman rezsoe nyers a moderate reformer 
appointed in an attempt to bridge ideological differences among the 
fourmember party leadership praised the position paper as a 
compromise serving the rebirth of our party as a new leftwing 
socialist party 
in a surprise turn nyers disclosed that former politburo member 
janos berecz one of the most bitter opponents of reform at the 
congress had asked whether there was room for him in the new party 
i said yes as a reform communist nyers said to cheers 
from some of the delegates 
the strong approval of the document was a blow to conservatives 
at the congress who had supported plans to make some changes in the 
existing party but rejected founding a new one 
imre pozsgay the leading reformer in the fourman party 
leadership had told reporters earlier he was closer to social 
democratic ideals than traditional communist ones he said the 
communist principles led to a dead end in eastern europe 
wherever they were tried 
he described soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs campaign 
for restructuring and openness as an encouraging wind for our 
reforms but emphasized that hungarys decisions were independent 
of other countries 
pozsgay has been the party candidate for the newly created 
government post of president in the planned elections 
premier miklos nemeth also a reformer and member of the 
collective party leadership told the delegates that the new party 
would have no room for those who have blood on their hands from 
past communist party excesses 
another test of reform and conservative strength at the congress 
was expected sunday in voting on leadership posts 
reformers with nearly 500 committed delegates represent the 
strongest faction at the congress with staunch conservatives 
numbering less than 100 
but several reformers said the conservatives were continuing 
efforts to win over hundreds of uncommitted delegates

an aviation disaster is turning into a 
windfall for a northwest iowa family 
glen galvin 17 has earned 6700 in rewards in his search for 
parts from a disintegrated engine from a jumbo jet that crashed 
this summer 
its kind of like winning the lottery only the odds are 
better said galvin a senior at alta high school 
the engine pieces are from a united airlines dc10 that was 
headed to chicago from denver when its no 2 engine broke apart on 
july 19 
as the shredded engine parts fell over northwest iowa they 
severed hydraulic lines in the plane crippling the flight 
controls pilots were able to bring the disabled plane to the 
airport at sioux city where it crashed on landing 
the crash claimed 112 lives but 184 people survived 
most of the parts found so far appear to be engine fan blades or 
pieces of blades said stephen gadd a lawyer representing general 
electric co the company made the cf66 tail engine that 
disintegrated before the crash 
still missing is the 300pound titanium disk that held the 
blades the company is offering 278000 in rewards for the parts 
ranging from a 500 minimum to 50000 for the disk gadd said 
they are offering the rewards in hopes the parts will provide 
clues to the cause of the crash 
galvin didnt begin looking for parts until the national guard 
completed its search of corn and soybean fields in the area 
i found one of the firststage engine pieces right away and 
that pretty much started it said galvin a search over the labor 
day weekend turned up most of his first batch of parts he 
said he found them in a pasture where he was riding his motor bike 
the first group of five engine parts netted him 3200 in 
rewards 
jerome clark a representative of ge aerospace engines 
inspected the newer parts in galvins possession thursday and said 
several will net the teenager another reward in the amount of 
3500

a leading soviet general made an unprecedented 
appearance saturday before an assembly of nato legislators touting 
the kremlins unilateral arms cuts and challenging the west to act 
on disarmament 
this is a great honor for me the warsaw pact and the soviet 
military this is a historic moment i am here even in uniform 
representing the warsaw pact said gen vladimir lobov the first 
deputy chief of staff of the soviet general staff 
lobov along with nato supreme commander gen john galvin spoke 
to the defense and security committee of the north atlantic 
assembly a consultative group of legislators from member nations 
of the north atlantic treaty organization 
the soviet union and the warsaw pact are no longer a threat to 
nato to the nato states and certainly not to the united states 
said lobov who is also a member of the soviet legislature 
he said the soviet union has decided unilaterally to reduce its 
forces by 500000 troops 10000 tanks and 8500 warplanes he said 
the soviets will withdraw three armored divisions from east germany 
and remove 500 nuclear warheads from the territories of its warsaw 
pact allies by the end of the year 
what are you doing lobov asked the legislators we are 
not just talking about things we are doing them and of course we 
are expecting something from you 
galvin said that despite the reductions the soviet union 
remains the most powerful military force in the world they 
will have to reduce a long way before things are brought into 
balance 
it is the conventional imbalance that poses the greatest 
threat to security in europe he added 
the nato commander suggested the soviets should take several 
steps at conventional arms reductions talks in vienna to raise 
western confidence 
galvin said the soviets should agree to remove their 
quickstrike capability by cuts in firstechelon forces in eastern 
europe dismantle supply depots in forward areas remove 
operational maneuver groups and highreadiness forces from forward 
areas slow conventional arms production agree to verification 
procedures and sign a pact to make the measures binding 
intentions can change galvin cautioned

president carlos menem on 
saturday pardoned more than 200 military officers accused of human 
rights abuses and aiding military rebellions saying the move was 
essential for national reconciliation 
the pardons also cover several dozen suspected leftist 
guerrillas 
i know there will be those who are unhappy but im also 
convinced that millions of argentines are applauding this 
measure menem said in brief comments from his home in la rioja 
province 745 miles northwest of buenos aires 
included in the pardons were leopoldo galtieri a former 
president and army commander and 38 other officers who faced trial 
in connection with the arrests disappearances and presumed 
killings of nearly 9000 suspected subversives during the socalled 
dirty war of the 197683 military dictatorships 
also pardoned were lt col aldo rico and col mohamed ali 
seineldin the leaders of military uprisings in april 1987 and 
january and december 1988 that threatened the elected government of 
then president raul alfonsin 
in all 39 officers charged with human rights abuses and 164 
officers accused in connection with the uprisings were free to 
leave prison menem said the pardons also applied to three 
officers convicted of mishandling the 1982 falklands war with 
britain former navy chief jorge anaya former air force chief 
basilio lami dozo and galtieri who faced the separate human 
rights charges dating from his days as a military commander before 
he became president in 1981 
menem and his peronist party said the pardons were the best way 
to end the rancor that divides this south america nation of 32 
million people 
alfonsin elected in october 1983 to end military rule and voted 
out of office last may was wedged between the military which 
opposed trials and human rights advocates who insisted they be 
held 
the military claimed the accused officers used unconventional 
tactics against an unconventinal enemy guerrillas whose bombings 
and assassinations led to the march 1976 coup against president 
isabel peron 
human rights groups claim the official list of 8960 people who 
disappeared is only about a third of the actual total 
justice should have been allowed to operate enrique pochat 
coordinator of the general ecumenical movement for human rights 
said of the pardons 
rene de epelbaum a leader of the mothers of the plaza de mayo 
human rights group said the pardons mock justice 
it is a true moral aberration that leaves in liberty those who 
violated human dignity and those who rose up against the 
constitutional order the activist said 
the opposition radical civic union argentinas secondlargest 
party also criticized the presidential pardons 
one of the things that is necessary to consolidate democracy 
is justice and impunity should not be sanctified said national 
deputy leopoldo moreau 
menem who took office on july 8 in the midst of an economic 
crisis involving tripledigit monthly inflation had as little room 
to maneuver as alfonsin 
more than 100000 protesters joined a rally sponsored last month 
by human rights groups to urge menem to reconsider the pardons he 
had hinted for months he would grant 
the groups also launched a petition drive to collect 1 million 
signatures to oppose pardons 
however menem a provincial governor at the time of the 1976 
military coup and then a political prisoner for nearly five years 
seemed to favor the military argument from the day he took office 
with the econony in such bad shape he said the country could 
not tolerate such bitter social divisions 
former presidents and generals jorge videla and roberto viola 
who were convicted in december 1985 of murder kidnapping and 
torture during the dirty war remained in prison they could be 
pardoned at a later time 
also remaining in jail on human rights charges were former 
buenos aires province police gen ramon camps who was convicted 
and sentenced to 30 years in jail and former gen carlos guillermo 
suarez mason who was extradited from the united states in may 1988 
and faces trial on charges of homicide 
the pardons also excluded one of the most notorious of the 
leftist guerrillas and the only one now in jail mario firmenich 
cofounder of the montonero terrorist group was convicted of 
murder and sentenced to 30 years in jail

voters stood in long lines under 
pouring rain saturday to vote for a new parliament for botswana 
one of the few african nations with regular multiparty elections 
the conservative botswana democratic party was expected to 
retain its comfortable majority it has governed this diamondrich 
country since independence from britain 23 years ago and supervised 
a capitalist economy that has made botswana one of africas most 
prosperous states 
eight political parties contested the elections the polls 
closed at 7 pm but final results were not expected until sunday 
there were no reports of turnout about 360000 people over the 
age of 21 were eligible to vote 
it was the sixth general election in this landlocked country in 
southern africa country since independence in 1966 
the democratic party now led by president quett masire has won 
all the elections it held 28 of the 34 seats in the former 
parliament 
the socialist botswana national front held five seats and 
controls the city council in gaborone the capital of this nation 
of 12 million people 
the botswana peoples party had one parliamentary seat which it 
was expected to lose the other five parties were not expected to 
win any seats 
masires party was expected to maintain its advantage because of 
botswanas booming economy which has grown at least 10 percent 
annually through the 1980s 
diamonds from the kalahari desert along with cattle ranching 
provide most of the wealth 
when botswana gained independence it was among the worlds 20 
poorest nations with a per capita annual income of less than 100 
today the average yearly income is more than 1000 one of the 
highest in africa 
on a continent crippled by foreign debt botwanas government 
has spent cautiously the country has foreign reserves in excess of 
2 billion 
masire who has been president since 1980 has avoided large 
expensive public works projects and his administration concentrated 
on smallscale development 
in foreign affairs his government has been critical of south 
africas policies of racial discrimination but it has kept close 
business ties with its powerful southern neighbor 
botswanas army has never fought a battle even though the 
country is surrounded by such tumultuous lands as south africa 
namibia angola and mozambique 
the botswana national front has said it can win seats in larger 
towns where jobs and houses are in short supply the front also 
claims botswanas wealth has not reached ordinary workers and 
declaried it would establish more social welfare programs

top aides to president bush met with senate 
leaders behind closed doors saturday in an effort to devise a 
strategy for winning a cut in capital gains taxes without delaying 
critical deficitreduction legislation 
democratic leaders who oppose the capital gains legislation 
were looking for a way to pass the deficitreduction bill without 
the tax cut 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine announced 
that seven hours of meetings had produced no agreement 
nevertheless he said he and republican leader bob dole of kansas 
believe that the prospects for such an agreement are sufficiently 
encouraging to commit that we will continue our meetings 
the next round of negotiations was scheduled sunday morning 
the central question is whether republicans will be able to add 
a capital gains cut to the bill by a simple majority vote 51 at 
most or whether they will have to get 60 votes because of rules 
that govern consideration of the deficit bill 
the house bill already includes a capital gains cut 
each side set the groundwork for blaming the other if the 
negotiations fail failure could mean further delay in passage of a 
catchall package of deficit reduction known as reconciliation 
and lead to automatic acrosstheboard cuts in federal spending on 
oct 16 
mitchell told reporters the white house is closely involved in 
the discussions our primary objective is a meaningful 
deficitreduction package he said the difference we have in 
this discussion is that the primary objective of the administration 
is a capitalgains tax cut 
dole said of the democrats theyve got a problem they are 
going to be blamed for the automatic budget cuts and theyve 
got to get out of it 
mitchell met with sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
finance committee and sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the 
budget committee house speaker thomas s foley dwash attended 
briefly 
trying to develop gop strategy with dole were sens pete 
domenici of new mexico and bob packwood of oregon senior 
republicans on respectively the budget and finance committees 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and white house budget 
director richard g darman led the administration effort 
the stated purpose of the meetings is to find a way to strip 
from the deficitreduction bill a package of revenue increases 
and spending cuts that are not directly related to reducing the 
deficit the measure has become so weighted down with extraneous 
pet projects that there is little likelihood that congress can 
enact it before the oct 16 deadline 
the chief controversy is over bushs proposal to cut taxes on 
capital gains the measure is part of the house version of the bill 
and republicans want to add it to the senate version 
democratic leaders in the senate are countering with an 
amendment to eliminate the capital gains cut and substitute an 
expansion of taxdeductible individual retirement accounts 
republicans insist that if every extraneous item is stripped 
from the bill and they dont concede that capital gains is 
extraneous they be assured a separate vote on capital gains that 
would leave them an easier path to passage with just a simple 
majority 
but mitchell was emphatic that democrats who control the 
senate will not waive any senate rules to make it easier for 
republicans to duplicate the capital gains victory they took in the 
house that will not happen he said

president virgilio barcos government 
was trying to negotiate a truce with drug traffickers until a 
presidential candidate was assassinated in august a newspaper said 
saturday 
however the presidents secretary general german montoya 
denied he had talked to drug traffickers and said the barco 
administration had never wavered in its commitment to fight the 
drug cartels 
he made the comments after the bogata daily la prensa said a 
former ambassador to the united nations had delivered messages 
between montoya and the drug dealers it said montoya had acted on 
direct orders from the president in the negotiations 
in four years leading up to the purported negotiations drug 
traffickers killed a justice minister an attorney general a 
newspaper publisher and scores of other people 
barcos administration began an unprecedented crackdown on the 
nations drug cartels after sen luis carlos galan a presidential 
candidate was killed while addressing a campaign rally on aug 18 
two of la prensas main owners are misael pastrana and belesario 
betancur both former presidents and members of the opposition 
conservative party barco is a member of the liberal party 
la prensa said it had documents from sen alvaro leyva duran 
also of the conservative party showing that montoya wanted talks 
to be held between the drug traffickers on one side and the 
colombian government and the united states on the other 
the drug lords reportedly were prepared to contract former us 
secretary of state henry kissengers washingtonbased lobbying firm 
to persuade the united states government to begin a dialogue 
according to the newspaper 
la prensa said us participation never developed because of 
strong opposition first by the reagan administration and then the 
bush administration 
in his sharply worded denial montoya said the decision of the 
government was and is to make sure that all the laws weight falls 
on those common criminals and terrorists 
his statement called the la prensa report calumnious and 
said it showed the papers lack of solidarity with the national 
crusade against drug traffickers that is led by the government and 
supported by the world 
he acknowledged meeting with a former un ambassador and 
interior minister joaquin vallejo but he said he did so on his 
own authority and told him there could be no talks with drug 
traffickers 
according to la prensa vallejo carried messages from the 
medellin drug cartel starting in september 1988 and up until five 
days after the assassination of galan the leading candidate for 
the liberal partys nomination for presidential elections in march 
authorities blamed drug traffickers for the murder 
at a meeting on aug 23 three days after galans burial 
montoya told vallejo that negotiations with traffickers were no 
longer possible because the government had decided to declare 
total war la prensa said 
barco began his declared war against traffickers on aug 19 
saying he would extradite traffickers wanted in the united states 
the traffickers responded with a terrorist bombing campaign 
which officials say is aimed at forcing the government into new 
talks 
the barco administration has said repeatedly since galans death 
that it will never agree to talks with drug lords responsible for 
slaying scores of the countrys political leaders police and army 
officials and judges 
la prensa said the main document among the messages is a memo in 
vallejos handwriting that summarizes proposals from group a 
identified as the medellin cartel la prensa published a photograph 
of the piece of paper 
according to the copy the cartel was ready to abandon the 
cocaine processing business turn over its arms laboratories and 
airstrips and help the government fight other drug traffickers in 
return the traffickers asked for amnesty and guarantees not to be 
extradited 
the three alleged chiefs of the cartel jorge luis ochoa pablo 
escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha are among the 12 colombian 
traffickers most wanted for extradition to the united states 
the colombian government has offered a 250000 reward for 
information leading to the capture of escobar and rodriguez 
us officials say the medellin cartel and a rival trafficking 
group based in the southern city of cali are responsible for 
processing 80 percent of the cocaine sold on us streets

occupants of beverly hills mansions and 
skidrow shelters marched handinhand saturday in the largest 
demonstration for decent and fair housing since the civil rights 
crusade of the 1960s 
the milelong march along constitution avenue from the 
washington monument to a rally site just short of the capitol 
crowned a threeday housing now campaign sponsored by more 
than 200 organizations on behalf of the homeless as well as all 
americans yearning for more affordable homes 
washington mayor marion barry himself a cosponsor of the 
parade claimed 250000 people in the throng which filled the 
entire line of progression and spilled into adjacent areas of the 
national mall 
us park police characterized that figure as too high but 
their own estimate 40000 was not compiled until late in the 
afternoon after many people had drifted away from more than five 
hours of speechmaking and entertainment dc metropolitan police 
spokesman abraham parks by contrast said his department counted 
between 70000 and 75000 at the same hour near the end of the 
program 
ohio gov richard celeste a democrat lauded the commitment of 
past republican presidents to fair and decent housing but 
declared im angry because ronald reagan betrayed that legacy 
as the crowd cheered celeste added the federal government 
found in one week 1 billion for the poor souls made homeless by 
hurricane hugo we need billions for the poor souls made homeless 
by hurricane ronnie 
celeste said there were 10000 marchers from ohio alone while 
15 times that many were in dire need of housing in his state 
the program culminated a political siege that had been months in 
the making and ended with the rousing oratory of the rev jesse 
jackson and the music of stevie wonder 
jackson said we are taught that the homeless are derelicts 
crazy people who have chosen selfdestruction my brothers and 
sisters this is america the richest nation in the world no one 
should go homeless their condition is not a measure of their 
worth its a measure of our worth 
jackson noted reports that reagan is getting 2 million to 
deliver two speeches in japan he can tell them how he disgraced 
our nation with radical disregard for the poor why are there 3 
million homeless they cut the housing department budget by 75 
percent and they stole the other 25 percent he said 
as for bush jackson said he wants to put more money in the 
hands of the rich so they can have a beach house and the poor can 
have no house thats why we march today 
most of the participants shared the celebratory mood dancing 
and singing as they paraded past the capitals landmarks though 
many were from the destitute ranks of the street people 
inhabiting heating grates cardboard boxes and abandoned cars 
bolstering their spirits were some early commitments mostly 
symbolic from both congress and the bush administration as a 
consequence of their lobbying blitz on thursday and friday 
despite conflicting crowd estimates the demonstration clearly 
was the largest on the housing issue since ronald reagan stemmed 
the governments illfated plunge into the construction of 
lowincome housing projects many of which have turned into 
highrise slums few now argue for a repetition of that effort the 
debate rather centers on ways to help the destitute and 
lowincome families integrate themselves into mainstream 
neighborhoods 
saturdays demonstration rivaled some of the huge turnouts for 
the civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s for which the issue 
of fair housing was but one component the event was backed by the 
aflcio us conference of mayors ymca and ywca national urban 
league catholic charities usa the southern christian leadership 
conference and the national organization for women among others 
the rev joseph lowery head of the sclc referred repeatedly to 
president bushs promise of a kinder and gentler nation and 
declared it is not kindness to have women and children comprise 
most of the homeless winter is coming and the soul of our nation 
is in peril 
it is not kind and gentle to spend 200 billion on the savings 
and loan bailout he added if this is the home of the brave 
why the hell are so many of our brave homeless 
coretta scott king widow of martin luther king jr said we 
did not come all this way just to let off steam we will not rest 
until every american has a decent job and home and a living wage 
let the word go out we shall be heard and we shall overcome

nominees despite criticism over their political connections 
the senate confirmed them on a voice vote with sen paul

the poor her lawyer said 
vergie encalade former manager of the st thomas parish federal 
credit union is facing a federal indictment that accuses her of 
siphoning off the money from october 1984 to august 1989 
its sort of hard for even her to explain her lawyer

people and institutions from starving children in ethiopia to the 
little sisters of the poor 
theres no evidence she or her family benefited from one cent 
of that money quigley said shes going to accept the 
responsibility for what happened and take whatever punishment the 
court feels appropriate 
a spokesman for the louisiana credit union league said the 
accounts of all 350 members are covered by insurance 
if convicted encalade faces up to five years in prison said 
first assistant us attorney al winters encalade is to turn

government troops in rural provinces killing four soldiers and 
wounding eight the defense ministry said saturday 
it said the attacks occurred friday in provinces north and east 
of managua the statement did not mention rebel casualties 
rebels known as contras killed six government soldiers in an 
early morning attack wednesday on a rural military outpost 
five central american presidents signed an agreement in august 
designed to end the war and repatriate the contras most of whom 
are in bases in honduras near the nicaraguan border in return the 
sandinista government promised to hold fair elections 
some contras have returned to nicaragua saying they plan to 
participate in the elections set for february but others rejected 
the peace plan and said they will continue fighting 
observers from the organization of american states have limited 
their movements because of the clashes there are 52 oas observers

anatoly karpov agreed to a 43move draw with 
fellow soviet artur yusupov in the fourth round of the world chess 
championshiop candidates semifinal on saturday and moved into a 
2515 lead 
in the other semifinal jon speelman of england and jan timman 
of the netherlands ajourned after a grueling sixhour round 
speelman playing white sealed his 64th move in a wellknown 
endgame position with few pieces which experts said is likely to 
end in a draw 
but speelman maintains the material advantage of a bishop for a 
pawn and he has the option to test timmans defensive technique 
over several playing sessions 
speelman should keep playing this is the first game where 
hes in the ascendancy said andrew martin a british 
international master 
after three games timman leads 21 
the winner of the candidates cycle will challenge world 
champion garri kasparov for his title in a 24game contest 
beginning october 1990 the winners of the eightgame semifinals 
will face off in the candidates final next march 
a win scores a point and a draw a half 
playing with the advantage of white karpovs cautious play 
enabled yusupov to equalize shortly after the opening and even gain 
a small edge in the resulting endgame 
with only three minutes thinking time left for 12 moves karpov 
defended easily and when he launched a brief counterattack yusupov 
forced a draw on the 43rd move 
although karpov retains his lead in the contest many experts 
have been surprised by lackluster performance in the first half of 
the contest 
karpov played very insipidly said british international 
master david norwood 
karpov 38 held the world title for 10 years until he lost to 
kasparov in 1985 and he was widely expected to wipe out yusupov in 
the match 
yusupov held dangerous initiatives in the second and third 
games but a horrendous blunder in the third let karpov seize the 
lead 
i feel sorry for yusupov hes playing like a hero but hes 
behind in the match said jonathan tisdall an international 
master who is speelmans chief second 
the closely contested encounter between speelman and timman 
featured a complicated struggle with the advantage switching 
throughout the game 
in the adjourned position speelman has a rook and a bishop and 
timman a rook and pawn 
if either match ends in a 44 tie two further games will be 
played followed if necessary by sudden death tiebreakers at 
increasingly high speeds 
the fifth round is scheduled for sunday with the sixth on 
tuesday play in the adjourned game is scheduled to resume monday 
even though that means the fourth will not be completed until after 
the fifth is played 
each player is allowed to take one timeout and postpone a game 
until the next scheduled session the four protagonists have 
preferred to reserve this option for the second half of their duels

conservative premier tzannis tzannetakis 
resigned saturday saying his governments mission of starting a 
cleanup of greeces politics was fulfilled elections are expected 
to be held for next month 
former socialist premier andreas papandreou whose 
scandalplagued government was replaced three months ago by 
tzannetakis administration said he accepted a presidential 
mandate to try to form a cabinet within three days 
tzannetakis said president christos sartzetakis accepted his 
resignation but he agreed to stay on as caretaker until a new 
cabinet is appointed 
he told reporters that during his 45minute meeting with 
sartzetakis at the presidential palace he explained that his 
rightleft coalition government completed its task of launching 
legal action against officials of the former socialist 
administration 
within two hours sartzetakis called in conservative new 
democracy party leader constantine mitsotakis to ask him to attempt 
to form a government but the 71yearold politician confident of 
victory at the polls rejected the mandate and recommended that 
procedures be hastened for the formation of a government to conduct 
elections on nov 5 
he was followed by papandreou whose panhellenic socialist 
movement pasok lost the june 18 elections after eight years in 
office 
papandreou told reporters as he left the palace that he had 
accepted the presidential mandate but it appeared highly unlikely 
he could put together an administration by monday that would win 
parliaments confidence 
mitsotakis said earlier that it would lack seriousness for 
papandreou to take the mandate and move around like a beggar since 
he knows one way or another that he has no margins to achieve any 
political result 
papandreou said mitsotakis comment insulted the democratic 
institutions and the countrys political life 
if all attempts to form another government fails sartzetakis 
then appoints a caretaker regime to take the country to elections 
in the june election new democracy won 145 seats in the 
300member unicameral parliament pasok took 125 places while the 
coalition of the left and progress copped 28 seats two remaining 
seats went to independents 
new democracy had joined in an unprecedented alliance with the 
communistdominated coalition of the left and progress to keep 
papandreou from retaining power and punish corrupt pasok officials 
parliament has twice remanded the 70yearold papandreou in the 
past three weeks to special courts where he will be tried for his 
alleged involvement in a multimillion dollar bank scandal and for 
allegedly instigating illegal wiretapping of his political friends 
and foes while he was in office

gay rights activists stormed a hotel on 
saturday to protest a conservative church group symposium where 
speakers warned that homosexuals are a threat to american culture 
about 35 activists chanted and blew whistles as they entered the 
lobby of the pan pacific hotel the protest occured about a half 
hour before the days keynote speech was set to be delivered 
the speech by william b allen chairman of the us commission 
on civil rights was titled blacks animals and homosexuals 
what is a minority 
the protesters sat on the floor for less than an hour before 
police wearing leather or surgical gloves led them away no 
immediate arrests were made 
the sitin was part of a larger demonstration at the hotel 
against the west coast symposium on homosexuality and public policy 
implications held by the california coalition for traditional 
values a churchformed organization 
the approximate 200 demonstrators outnumbered the estimated 150 
people attending the event 
allens speech was delayed nearly four hours from its scheduled 
noon delivery time a conference organizer said his plane was 
delayed in monterey 
on friday the us commission on civil rights with allen 
dissenting branded the title of the speech thoughtless 
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory 
allen told reporters after his speech that the title was as 
innocent as can be and blasted his colleagues for not reading 
the prepared remarks 
allen won a standing ovation for the speech in which he opposed 
antidiscrimination laws for specific ethnic or minority groups 
historically that process has always led to heightened 
tensions and heightened antagonisms among the groups competing for 
the rewards of the society he said 
such demands by blacks in the civil rights era spawned a similar 
movement for animals argued allen who is black 
express laws for minority groups is the beginning of the 
evil of reducing american blacks to an equality with animals and 
then seducing other groups including homosexuals to seek the same 
charitable treatment he said 
basically what is going on in here is gaybashing said 
kevin farrell of the orange county visibility league a homosexual 
rights group with about 300 members 
whats dangerous here is the thin veneer of respectability 
farrell said outside the hotel in this orange county city 25 miles 
southeast of downtown los angeles

a man in a fake mustache glasses and a phony 
accent made the evening news by posing as the spokesman for local 
panamanians opposed to that nations leader gen manuel noriega 
kurt rappaport 22 is a university of southern california 
graduate and son of a lawyer but viewers who watched the news on 
kttv last tuesday saw him as arturo valdez chairman of the 
nonexistent usapanama friendship council 
in a 10second segment rappaport told an interviewer in broken 
english that the southern california panamanian community was 
willing to send money forces anything with help from the 
united states to fight noriega 
they see right through him like a clear curtain rappaport 
said 
rolando santos kttvs director of news operations confirmed on 
friday that the station had been hoaxed 
basically if you look at the situation somebody played a 
prank on us santos said were trying to track down what 
happened right now obviously it was not intentional 
the news staff followed proper procedures including calling 
officials in washington dc he said 
rappaport said the impersonation began on a whim last tuesday 
afternoon when a woman identifying herself as a representative of 
the kttv assignment desk called his home in beverly hills 
the woman asked if she had reached the panamanian consulate 
rappaport replied that she had but no officials were available to 
talk he took down a telephone number and called back a few minutes 
later as arturo valdez 
id just finished playing tennis and i had to take a shower 
put on a suit and tie he said i dug out an old pair of 
glasses but i had to shop around for the mustache 
the mustache was slightly askew when he arrived at the fox tv 
studio so rappaport declined pancake makeup exclaiming no i 
am not here to be beautiful i am here to speak for my country 
after the interview rappaport discovered that the panamanian 
consulate in los angeles had closed sept 1

several hundred white pelicans that were found beside eastern 
sierra lakes and streams that supply drinking water to los angeles 
authorities stressed that the deaths of the large migratory 
birds while unusual is no threat to the water supply but tests 
were being conducted to see if something in the water could be 
causing the deaths 
cousins of the brown pelicans found on the california coast the 
white pelicans nest over a wide area of the west but the trouble 
seems confined to the eastern sierra

parasitic worms in the walls of the stomachs of nearly all the 
birds said david jessup a state veterinarian and pathologist in 
sacramento 
there were signs of malnutrition that could be explained by the 
worms but the birds did not appear to have starved he said 
jessup said however that many other causes cannot yet be ruled 
out no significant pesticide residue has been found but more 
detailed tests will be made to see if the pelicans had ingested 
high levels of toxic metals he said

white house chief of staff john sununu 
insisted saturday that us failure to intervene on behalf of 
insurgent pananmanian officers trying to overthrow gen manuel 
antonio noriega last week does not foretell us policy 
he said there will be a time for an effective way to get 
general noriega out and gave 8to5 odds that will happen within 
six months 
at the same time however he indicated in a cnn evans and 
novak television interview that the united states wanted the 
panama defense force coup leaders to turn over noriega to us 
hands without any aggressive action by the united states 
a news report said the united states decided to ask the coup 
leaders for just that action but the decision came too late 
the washington post reported in its sunday editions the 
commander of us forces in panama was authorized to covertly take 
noriega to an american military base during last weeks coup 
attempt but the authorization came just as the attempted coup 
collapsed tuesday afternoon the post quoted administration and 
congressional sources as saying 
the sources told the post gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff relayed the authorization from defense 
secretary dick cheney to gen maxwell r thurman head of us 
forces in panama 
thurman was told any mission would have to be carried out 
without visible display of us forces but military personnel 
could act undercover the post reported powell told thurman he 
could have the rebels deliver noriega to a us base 
powell also told thurman to avoid the possibility of armed 
conflict with pro and antinoriega forces according to the post 
he was also ordered to develop a plan to capture noriega with armed 
forces and take him to an american base but was told the plan 
would have to be approved by president bush before action could be 
taken 
a pentagon spokesman said late saturday he could not confirm the 
report 
sununu asked saturday what it would have taken to get bush to 
use military force in the coup said the easiest thing that 
could have happened is if the pdf forces brought mister noriega to 
territory that is under the treaty under the control of the united 
states and we could enforce the indictment against noriega for 
drug trafficking charges 
asked whether he meant the administration was unwilling to take 
any aggressive action sununu replied youre talking about an 
invasion of panama and said the ideal thing is for the 
panamanians to undertake the ouster 
congressional criticism of bushs actions meanwhile continued 
saturday with sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate 
intelligence committee stating that the white house erred in not 
having the cia represented at two key decisionmaking meetings on 
panama on monday and tuesday 
criticism has come from both democrats and republicans who 
accuse the white house of bungling its way through the crisis and 
helping doom the coup 
boren said he was also bothered that because im not certain 
that the president was ever really well served or presented with 
the kind of decision options that should have been presented to him 
he said he could find no evidence that bush was told the noriega 
loyalists were travelling to the pdf headquarters via routes other 
than those blocked by us troops he complained bush was never 
asked mister president will you give us authority to use 
american troops to block those routes to keep those reinforcements 
from being able to come in and quash the coup 
meanwhile a newsweek magazine poll released saturday said 60 
percent of the 750 adults polled thursday and friday said it was 
very important to get noriega out of power and 45 percent 
believe the united states lent the right amount of support to the 
coup attempt nine percent said they thought the united states did 
too much and 30 percent not enough 
pressed during the cnn interview for his prediction on whether 
noriega would still be in power after six months sununu said we 
certainly would like to see him out the president has said he 
wants him out and i cant believe that between the will of the 
people of panama and the will of the people of the united states 
we cant achieve that if you want odds id say eighttofive 
that he probably will be out 
as to why panamanians should think the united states would back 
any future coup efforts with us troops he said the aborted coup 
last week proves there is unrest in the pdf and i would not be 
surprised if the pdf understands that when the president says our 
quarrel is not with the pdf but with general noriega that there 
will be continued unrest in that and an opportunity will come along 
in an effective way to get general noriega out 
continuing an administration effort to counter criticism that 
the united states should have sent its troops to back up the coup 
sununu said there was no communication from the coup leaders inside 
noriegas headquarters until they were about to be overwhelmed 
by noriegas defenders 
and countering congressional allegations that the united states 
was given a chance to retrieve noriega he said there was no 
indication whatsoever whether general noriega was in there in 
time for bush to make a decision on intervening 
then he said the rebels made it clear they did not want to 
give general noriega to the united states for trial and right 
after that the superior forces of noriega regained power 
he also disputed a report that he now wants to alter the 
administrations decisionmaking operation to have the national 
security council take charge in such crises the chief of staff 
said it was appropriate during the panama situation that the 
chain of command came through the pentagon via southern command 
headquarters in panama to secretary of defense dick cheney and 
then to the white house

critical report that there were dangerous amounts of plutonium in 
uncontrolled conditions at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant

this is at least the seventh report ive received from the 
department of energy in the last three years that says rocky flats 
suffers from lax safety attitudes and that also admits things 
just arent improving said rep david skaggs dcolo whose 
district includes the 364acre plant near golden 
the inspectors said in a report on safety conditions at the 
plant that many changes are needed to improve controls on plutonium 
used to shape triggers for nuclear warheads 
fridays report said that while no evidence was found that an 
accidental nuclear reaction had ever occurred at rocky flats there 
is a real possibility of such a disaster because the plant 
operator doesnt properly control all its plutonium

a new study weakens the evidence linking 
manicdepressive illness to a genetic defect as proposed in a 
widely reported 1987 paper says a scientist who participated in 
both studies 
although the evidence remains suggestive its not up to the 
accepted or the conventional level of significance that has been 
used in these kinds of studies said david pauls 
the original study had been hailed as the first to show a 
genetic defect in a psychiatric illness that includes no physical 
abnormalities in the brain 
but with the new data researchers are not nearly as confident 
as we were that they had found the approximate location of such a 
gene said pauls of the yale university school of medicine
