the university of utah has another week to 
persuade the state that it invested wisely in nuclear fusion but is 
facing an unexpected snag its chief researcher electrochemist b 
stanley pons has vanished 
pons and british colleague martin fleischmann announced in march 
1989 tat they had achieved a sustained nuclear fusion reaction in 
a tabletop experiment the announcement held out the prospect of a 
cheap safe and virtually inexhaustible source of energy 
despite extreme scientific skepticism that continues today the 
legislature appropriated 5 million last fall to establish the 
national cold fusion institute at the school and to protect the 
states patent rights 
university officials need to persuade the fusion energy advisory 
council which oversees the states investment by nov 1 that the 
institute should be allowed to continue operating 
pons a tenured professor and former chairman of the chemistry 
department has put his house in salt lake up for sale and his 
telephone was disconnected tuesday the deseret news quoted an 
unidentified university source as saying pons family has moved out 
of town 
hugo rossi dean of the universitys college of science said he 
doesnt know where pons is or what his plans are 
our understanding is that he has made satisfactory 
arrangements for his teaching obligation this fall and he will be 
here to meet his obligation for winter quarter rossi said 
james brophy the universitys vice president of research said 
officials are expecting a formal letter outlining pons plans for 
winter quarter last week brophy said pons was visiting foreign 
laboratories a common practice for senior researchers 
the state council is meeting thursday to review the status of 
the ponsfleischmann experiments and fusion patents over the last 
year 
pons and fleischmann said their experiments involving 
electrically charged platinum coils containing rods of palladium 
immersed in deuteriumrich heavy water produced 100 times the 
energy needed to produce a reaction 
we want to know where we stand on the program and what we have 
to do in the future to preserve our position in this science 
said council chairman raymond l hixson we have gone this far 
with it we had better be sure we are protected for future 
developments 
hixson said there is much information pons and fleischmann have 
not released about their experiments but he is sure they have 
reasons for doing so that information however will be critical 
to the scientific review of the fusion institute which was 
supposed to get under way in august 
hixson said pons disappearance kind of muddles everything

leftist rebels on tuesday 
killed two children and wounded two other civilians in a botched 
homemade mortar attack on the defense ministry compound 
two powerful mortartype bombs fell at dusk about 175 yards 
short of the sprawling military compound on a house in the 
neighborhood of san francisco 
the bodies of natalie salazar 9 and her brother gerardo an 
adolescent about 16 years old were found in the rubble of the big 
house in the affluent neighborhood 
magdalena salazar identified by the authorities as the dead 
childrens mother and vilma molina their aunt were taken from 
the home in ambulances 
some neighbors said they believed the children had been visiting 
from the united states and could have been us citizens but 
embassy authorities said both the fatalities were salvadorans 
the attack came six days after similar homemade mortars were 
used in an attack on the main air force base on the capitals 
eastern edge 
in that attack rebels of the farabundo marti national 
liberation front hit their target with the powerful homemade 
artillery dubbed tepezcuintles a native wild pig 
the bombs are made of refillable propane gas containers filled 
with explosive each one weighs about 40 pounds 
col mauricio vargas subchief of the joint chiefs of staff 
that shares the compound with the defense ministry was asked if 
the target of the attack was the ministry 
what should concern us is not what was the target but the 
result the deaths of these children and the destruction he 
said 
the bombs almost completely destroyed the home where the 
casualties occurred and damaged the one next to it some walls were 
left standing but roof was collapsed in a pile of rubble glass 
and twisted reinforcement rods

the fbis longrunning probe of state 
capitol corruption resulted in indictments tuesday against a 
legislative aide and a former aide and prosecutors cleared a 
lawmaker of any involvement in the case 
us attorney david levi said no charges would be filed against 
assemblywoman gwen moore dlos angeles the author of 
specialinterest bills that figured prominently in the probe 
levi said the evidence when viewed in its entirety didnt 
warrant any charges against moore who chairs the assembly 
utilities and commerce committee 
so far eight people including two former state senators have 
been charged in connection with the 5yearold fbi probe which 
levi said is continuing in the sting fbi agents posed as 
businessmen offering money for legislative favors 
a federal grand jury on tuesday indicted moores former top 
aide tyrone netters on nine counts accusing him of racketeering 
bribery extortion conspiracy money laundering and filing a false 
income tax return prosecutors said netters who now works for the 
assembly rules committee was placed on administrative leave 
tuesday said bob connelly the assemblys chief administrative 
officer 
darryl freeman a former assembly aide and lobbyist was 
indicted on conspiracy and extortion charges 
moore who has represented a los angeles area district since 
1978 said levis announcement made tuesday a happy day for me 
and my family 
for more than two years i have fully and completely cooperated 
with the fbi in its investigations moore said i knew i had 
done absolutely nothing wrong and today that was confirmed by the 
us attorney 
if convicted netters 36 faces up to 163 years in prison and a 
32 million fine and freeman 43 up to 40 years in prison and a 
500000 fine 
the indictment also seeks repayment of nearly 15000 that 
netters received from fbi undercover agents 
so far eight people including two former state senators have 
been charged in connection with the 5yearold fbi probe which 
levi said is continuing in the sting fbi agents posed as 
businessmen offering money for legislative favors 
the investigation was revealed in august 1988 when about 30 fbi 
agents raided the state capitol searching the offices of four 
lawmakers including moore and their aides 
the former senators democrats joseph montoya of whittier and 
paul carpenter of cypress were convicted of corruption charges 
earlier this year montoya is serving a 6year prison sentence 
carpenter now a member of a state tax board is awaiting

stacy mcintire and her visitors wanted 
something with cheese and sauce so they did the obvious thing at a 
notsoobvious place 
they went out for pizza at mcdonalds 
we had company over and we fed four people on two pizzas for 
something like 12 she said we went to the drivethrough and 
didnt even have to get out of the car we got it in five 
minutes 
pizza in the land of allbeef patties special sauce lettuce 
cheese pickles onions and sesameseed buns is this a fastfood 
induced nightmare 
not at all mcdonalds which for years counted its hamburger 
sales in the billions may soon be counting pizza pasta and other 
nontraditional offerings in an attempt to boost sluggish us 
dinner sales 
owensboros four golden arches and 10 others across the ohio 
river in evansville ind are among 240 restaurants nationwide 
which are testmarketing tomato pies the 12inch pies also are 
being tested in las vegas hartford conn fresno calif and 
suburbs of chicago 
fresh carrots and celery sticks are being test marketed in 
pennsylvania and california and mcdonalds also is experimenting 
with fresh fruit and soups 
our customers are interested in a little more variety and more 
choices said melissa oakley spokeswoman at mcdonalds corps 
oak brook ill headquarters but we have to be very careful in 
what we choose were still committed to serving a limited menu 
mcdonalds held up by many as a model american corporation has 
long been committed to test marketing salads the mcdlt and 
chicken mcnuggets made the grade the hulaburger two slices of 
cheese with a slice of grilled pineapple on a toasted bun did not 
ms oakley noted that mcdonalds tested salads for 10 years 
before introducing them in all of its 8500 us restaurants 
but michael mueller a montgomery securities inc analyst who 
specializes in restaurants says mcdonalds has reasons to press 
ahead with pizza now investors complaints about the companys 
recent us sales growth 
a pattern of progressively weaker domestic sales growth began in 
1988 after peaking at 116 percent in 1987 a selloff of the 
companys stock followed release of second quarter results showing 
domestic sales of 6 billion for the first half of 1990 a 
33percent increase from the irst half of 1989 
from their standpoint they have to do something to boost 
dinner sales mueller said this pizza is better than 
nothing 
but is it better than tonys or vitos or sals 
if you like pizza its just not right said elaine lillpop 
of rockport ind its a hurryup job 
she complained that the pepperoni pizza she bought in owensboro 
tasted burned and didnt have enough cheese her 8yearold 
daughter kari said she didnt like it either 
gail thompson of owensboro said she won a free pizza and liked 
it but wouldnt buy another 
i love pizza but i dont particularly like eating it in this 
atmosphere she said between bites of a burger its not fast 
food to me 
that says mueller is the problem pizza doesnt follow the 
rules that helped make mcdonalds the worlds largest restaurant 
chain 
in the past theyve been successful introducing products that 
are cheap easy to eat and come with quick service at the 
drivethrough window said the san franciscobased analyst 
pizza is expensive hard to eat in the car and takes five 
minutes or more to get 
pizza also requires special ovens and is more difficult to make 
and there are lots of competitors already established in the pizza 
market mueller said 
another restaurant analyst roy burry of kidder peabody in new 
york acknowledged the problems but he expressed confidence that 
mcdonalds would find a fastfood pizza that works 
theyve been on track for five or six years with this he 
said it takes a long time to get it right which of course they 
will 
pizza was a logical choice burry said the demand for more 
traditional fast food is not keeping pace with the number of new 
restaurants he said 
pizza is the only fast food product thats growing he said 
its a mammoth market it offers major potential for them 
burry predicted the pizza might be ready for a national rollout 
within two years the test likely will be expanded to more markets 
next year he said 
ms oakley said mcdonalds has not yet decided the products 
fate 
she said pizza is doing very well although the company 
wont discuss sales figures pizza hut the largest pizza chain 
maintains that mcdonalds holds only 2 percent of sales in the 
owensboroevansville market 
evansville workers said sales have been sporadic a cheese pizza 
recently sold there for 499 the deluxe with cheese sausage 
pepperoni green peppers onion tomato and mushrooms sold for 
799 some restaurants sell pizza only after 4 pm some offer 
quarterpie slices for lunch 
the owensboro restaurants lure pizza buyers with glass windows 
that allow customer to watch sausage and pepperoni being spread by 
hand but they dont see dough lovingly kneaded and tossed 
mcdonalds sacrificed fresh dough for frozen in its attempt to 
make pizza a fast food some customers say the dough will be the 
pizzas downfall 
it tastes like cardboard said 16yearold josh hamburg of 
owensboro

the liberation of eastern europe has 
stripped police of their greatest weapon fear and crime is 
booming 
people seldom tested police authority in the old days they knew 
every officer was empowered by the communist authorities to 
intimidate beat or arrest anyone 
crime existed but the streets were generally safe for all 
except dissidents 
when communist parties fell from power the prestige and 
authority of police fell with them without the advantage of fear 
the forces of law and order seem unequal to hightech criminals 
emboldened by the new climate of freedom and the high profits of 
dishonesty 
when i started walking a beat a couple of years ago all i had 
to do was look hard at any suspicious character said joska an 
officer in his late 20s 
when im off duty and walking around here now i have be extra 
sharp to make sure nobody picks my pocket joska whose beat is 
fashionable vaci street would not give his full name 
hungarian police recorded a 388 percent increase in crime 
during the first six months of 1990 compared with the same period 
last year in budapest 48279 criminal cases were under 
investigation up 795 percent from a year earlier 
police in the predominantly rural slovak republic of 
czechoslovakia reported a relatively modest 17 percent increase in 
crime but the growth rate was 52 percent among the urbanized 
czechs with muggings up 250 percent in the first half of the year 
in prague crime went up 138 percent 
one reason bulgaria began rationing some goods was that black 
marketeers were hijacking 70 percent of the shipments bound for 
stores the newspaper duma reported in september 
poland reported a 69 percent increase in crime during the first 
half of 1990 and a 12 percent higher murder rate to 236 killings 
in a nation of 37 million 
in romania with a population of 23 million people 886 murders 
had been committed by the end of august nearly double the number 
in the first eight months of 1989 
both street and whitecollar crime have increased in the soviet 
union where democratic change has been slowest 
embezzlement cases are twice as numerous as last year said 
vyacheslav i runyshkov of the interior ministry and investigators 
found corruption in half the 160000 state firms checked between 
january and august 
sometimes lack of respect leads to the humiliation of police 
about 20 pickpockets routed polish officers at warsaws huge 
main railroad station in august 
they sprayed some with a paralyzing gas and attacked others with 
planks ripped from benches one patrolman was hospitalized and 
police managed to arrest only one person 
among recent victims of bulgarias brazen pickpockets was a 
greek police general relieved of his wallet in a sofia department 
store 
in prague citizens conditioned by the image of police as the 
enemy ganged up on several pursuing officers when a pickpocket 
yelled the police are after me the suspect escaped 
people must realize that in a democracy the police force 
functions as a protective force and not an abuser of its powers 
vladimir nikl a prague criminologist told reporters it must 
not be treated as an enemy 
technology is another problem criminals often have better 
equipment than the police 
old sovietmade lada squad cars and walkietalkies from the 
early 1960s are no match for mercedes bmws and the latest 
electronics 
krokodil the soviet satirical weekly devoted a cover page to 
the unequal contest it depicted policemen on bicycles armed with 
slingshots pursuing gangsters firing submachine guns from a 
mercedes 
lt col janos bodracka head of the criminal investigations 
unit in budapest said police could not expect financial help while 
east european governments are trying to modernize their economies 
if i gave you one of our radios you couldnt talk to someone 
10 meters away he said if one cop tries to warn another that 
the suspect is about to leave the damn thing is so lod it scares 
the suspect away 
i have 20 cars for 100 detectives and most of them cannot do 
over 120 kilometers 70 miles an hour western criminals can walk 
in here and get away with murder 
low pay exacerbates the grievances of bad image and outdated 
equipment 
junior police officers in warsaw are paid the equivalent of 
about 115 a month the pay in hungary is 150 and the rates 
elsewhere are no better with inflation rapidly outstripping wages 
corruption is growing 
bright young people avoid the profession in warsaw where the 
police force has 9500 officers and needs 4000 more only about 
150 of this summers 2000 applicants met the requirements 
bodracka said the budapest force of approximately 4000 needs at 
least 500 more officers and even that would leave the city of 2 
million understaffed by western standards 
our strength is nearing an end but the criminals are growing 
more and more active he said citizens have to realize that 
the quiet days are over

president bushs veto of civil rights 
legislation hurts him with a constituency he yearns to attract but 
it helps him with voters who put him in the white house 
that was the assessment monday of republican political 
operatives who emphasized the importance of making it clear that 
the presidents opposition was to quotas not to civil rights 
the temptation to support a bill any bill simply because 
its title includes the words civil rights is very strong bush 
said in his veto message 
but when our efforts however wellintentioned result in 
quotas equal opportunity is not advanced but thwarted the 
president added 
i dont think its going to play very well in the black 
community republican former gov thomas kean of new jersey said 
of the quota argument 
kean who got more than 60 percent of the black vote in his 
landslide 1985 reelection campaign said he believed bush did what 
he thought was right although id like to have seen him sign 
it 
the way the legislation was described by its proponents and 
opponents defined the political issues 
to supporters it was civil rights legislation needed to nullify 
six supreme court decisions that made it more difficult for women 
and minorities to prove and win job discrimination suits the 
measure banned racial harassment in the workplace and allowed 
punitive damages in the most serious discrimination cases 
to opponents the issue was quotas not civil rights and quotas 
is a potent issue in american politics 
republicans are trying not to call it a civil rights bill 
said michele davis executive director of the republican governors 
association weve got to do a lot better job explaining what 
this legislation does 
the key for republicans is convincing people it is quota 
legislation 
the strength of that issue was seen in the race for governor of 
california where republican pete wilson succeeded in portraying 
democrat dianne feinstein as advocating quotas in state hiring 
it brought some republicans home said davis 
there were reports that bush got conflicting advice from white 
house aides some arguing he should continue negotiations until he 
could find a compromise others urging a quick veto 
kean said he wished the president had found a way to negotiate a 
compromise 
what bothers me is while the disagreements loomed large they 
are only over at most 10 to 20 percent of the bill he said at 
the same time kean said certain people in the political world 
wanted a presidential veto more than they wanted a civil rights 
bill 
proponents of a veto argued that the president needed to avoid 
furthering the image of indecisiveness created when he shifted his 
position on whether he would accept a tax increase to help reduce 
the federal budget deficit 
given where he is on the budget battle the president is wise 
to stick to his guns on quotas said roger stone a republican 
consultant who has been a strong advocate of the need for the gop 
to reach out to black voters 
it the veto will anger a certain constituency said stone 
it will also if bush continues to push his opposition to quotas 
help him with his base constituency 
robert teeter a republican pollster and adviser to bush said 
it was essential that the president make it clear hes in favor 
of civil rights 
teeter noted that in recent polls bush has received high marks 
from more than 40 percent of blacks a ranking that was far higher 
than the 10 percent approval ratings president reagan generally had 
in the black community 
but will a veto of civil rights legislation cause blacks to view 
bush as not that much different than reagan 
teeter insisted that wouldnt happen 
he is not has not been will not be perceived the same as 
reagan said the pollster 
as part of the republican outreach effort the gop has three 
blacks running for the house this year all considered credible 
candidates and all opposed to the bill on the ground it would 
encourage establishment of quotas 
during a debate sunday night in connecticut democratic former 
rep toby moffett said it was a disgrace that his congressional 
campaign opponent republican gary franks opposed the bill 
do not talk to me about civil rights said franks who is 
black i had a cross burned in front of my house when he was 9 
years old

a tough new clean air bill is expected to 
breeze through the house and senate this week and be signed into 
law by president bush 
a housesenate conference committee approved the legislation 
with only one dissenting voice on monday democratic and republican 
leaders expressed confidence the measure will clear congress 
probably wednesday 
the legislation which is expected to cost the economy more than 
22 billion a year when all its provisions are in force requires 
new pollution controls on factories thousands of businesses 
automobiles and electric power plants 
bush noted that it has been 13 years since federal air pollution 
laws were revised and said this congress this week should send 
me a clean air bill that i can sign white house sources said 
there did not appear to be anything in the measure that would keep 
the president from signing it 
a provision calling for 250 million in assistance to workers 
who lose their jobs because of new air pollution controls had been 
of concern to the administration but modifications in the plan 
during final negotiations early monday appeared to have made the 
measure acceptable to the white house 
while we have to take a look at the final language we are 
encouraged by the agreement reached on the jobs assistance 
amendment said white house spokesman steve hart 
the new pollution controls will affect not only huge 
petrochemical plants but also smaller businesses such as dry 
cleaners paint shops furniture refinishers and operators of 
fleets of automobiles automakers will have to intensify their push 
to develop alternativefuel cars and the oil companies must produce 
cleaner burning fuels 
in some regions especially the indusrial midwest utilities 
will have to find ways to cut sulfur dioxide emissions which 
causes acid rain and may decide to do so by either switching to 
lowsulfur coal or installing expensive scrubbers either way 
the costs likely will be passed on in form of higher electric 
rates 
as plants turn away from highsulfur coal to fuel their 
generators it is expected that miners in such states as west 
virginia will be thrown out of work that is why rep robert wise 
dwva pushed for the jobloss assistance provision in the bill 
this bill touches virtually all americans from and 
environmental point of view and from an economic point of view 
said sen max baucus dmont chairman of the conference that 
crafted the legislation 
rep john dingell dmich who headed the house negotiating 
team called the new legislation fair and reasonable 
among the major requirements in the 700page legislation 
utilities must cut annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 
million tons by the year 2001 to reduce acid rain which kills 
trees and aquatic life 
automakers must slash tailpipe emissions by 30 to 60 percent 
and provide more alternativefuel cars for fleet operators and for 
a limited pilot program for passenger cars in california 
businesses such as dry cleaners must cut smogproducing 
emissions 
cleanerburning gasoline including ethanol blends must be 
sold in cities with the worst smog problems 
for the first time industry must install control technology to 
cut toxic chemical releases by 90 percent additional pollution 
controls may be required to reduce cancer risks near plants in some 
cases 
house and senate negotiators worked out agreement on the 
legislation before dawn monday and the conference committee 
formally approved the measure in a voice vote later in the day 
only rep william dannemeyer rcalif opposed it 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
legislation historic in its significance and said he expected 
both the senate and house to endorse it and bush to sign it into 
law 
republican members of the clean air conference including rep 
norman lent of new york and sen john chafee of rhode island also 
predicted presidential approval 
the white house estimates the legislation will cost the economy 
11 billion a year by 1995 and 22 billion to 25 billion annually 
by 2005 when the bills provisions take full effect 
industry estimates have put the annual cost in the 30 
billion50 billion range toward the end of the decade while 
environmentalists maintain that any costs would be largely offset 
by saving 50 billion now spent yearly for health care because of 
dirty air

congressional and white house budget 
bargainers moved to the verge of a compromise late monday on a 
250billion deficitreduction bill raising taxes on the wealthy 
and cutting medicare participants said 
party leaders planned to present rankandfile members tuesday 
with options for resolving remaining disputes over taxing the rich 
raising the gasoline tax and constraining medicare spending said 
one democrat who asked to not be identified 
democratic and republican congressional leaders met privately 
with bush administration officials until after 11 pm monday in 
the capitol afterward none would say a bargain had been struck 
but many said good progress had been made 
asked if the two sides were on the brink of a budget deal house 
speaker thomas foley dwash said i think so 
were making progress said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
democrats were strongly considering dropping their call for a 
surtax on millionaires in the face of adamant opposition by 
president bush and republican senators to a surtax on the rich 
democrats were weighing a gop alternative that would limit the 
deductions millionaires can itemize on their income taxes 
house democratic leaders were sounding out their rank and file 
to see how much support there was for that idea 
with the two sides advancing otherwise similar proposals to 
raise taxes on the wealthy agreement on this matter would be a 
major step toward completion of a 250 billion deficitreduction 
pact leaders would like to bring a compromise bill to the house 
and senate floors by midweek 
early in the day chairman dan rostenkowski dill of the 
taxwriting house ways and means committee said he believed 
republicans and democrats could work out a plan to raise taxes on 
the wealthy 
later he said some house democrats were against the gop plan to 
limit deductions on the rich lawmakers from states with high local 
taxes or where charitable contributions are high suc as new york 
and california fear that the measure would hurt them 
disproportionately 
the question is can i pass it rostenkowski said i dont 
know i lose too many state delegations 
on a day in which weary lawmakers spent hours waiting for 
computers to analyze various tax proposals gallows humor 
prevailed 
so far its been very productive senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan said early we havent met 
the legislation is aimed at cutting the federal deficit over 
five years by taking action on two fronts 
raising taxes including levies on tobacco alcohol airline 
tickets and such luxuries as furs and yachts 
restraining spending including money for student loans 
benefits for veterans and retired civil servants agricultural 
programs and dozens of other areas 
both sides have suggested raising the incometax rate to 31 
percent on the richest americans up from its current 28 percent 
they have also proposed limiting the deductions available to people 
earning more than 100000 
democrats want to also impose a 75 percent surtax on people 
earning more than 1 million yearly 
ninetyfive percent of this package essentially is demanding 
serious sacrifice from everyone else veterans government 
employees working families said house budget committee chairman 
leon panetta dcalif we think its fair to let millionaires pay 
their fair share 
but gop senators were ardently against the idea arguing that 
imposing a surtax on some taxpayers would invite boosts later on 
for everyone after days of bargaining democrats were considering 
other plans which house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
described as infinitely changeable 
the two sides were entertaining similar offers in other 
unresolved areas 
they seemed near agreeing that the 9centpergallon gasoline 
tax would increase by a nickel or perhaps slightly more and while 
democrats wanted to reduce the growth of medicare by about 44 
billion over the next five years republicans wanted to slash to be 
about 3 billion deeper 
but participants emphasized that nothing had been settled in 
either of those areas democrats were saying the more taxes they 
could raise from the wealthy the milder the medicare reductions 
would be 
m and m is still the problem millionaires and medicare 
panetta said 
there were even hints that the gasoline tax might not be raised 
at all 
rep dale kildee dmich said gephardt told him it would be 
difficult for democrats to achieve the 10 percent surtax on the 
wealthy but indicated it might be possible to leave the gasoline 
tax alone 
last year 65000 families reported earning more than 1 million 
on their incometax returns boosting tax rates on the wealthiest 
people would mean an increase for 600000 families 
bargaining was also continuing over raising the 51300 ceiling 
below which the 145 percent medicare tax is deducted from 
paychecks democrats want to boost the cap to 125000 republicans 
to 98000 
the bill when completed would be the cornerstone of 500 
billion worth of savings over the next five years the rest of the 
deficitcutting would come from restraining the defense budget in a 
separate bill and from savings from projected payments on the 
national debt 
white house budget chief richard darman was in the capitol 
monday participating in the talks on sunday white house chief of 
staff john sununu and other administration officials left the 
meetings complaining that democrats were not responding to gop 
offers the meetings went on without them

president bush is escaping the battle of the 
budget for a day to stump for republican candidates in new england 
one of the most economically hardpressed regions of the country 
bush planned to speak at fundraisers for gop candidates in 
burlington vt manchester nh and in the connecticut cities of 
waterbury and stamford 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bushs speeches 
will deal primarily with budgetary matters but will be also 
heavily aimed toward the local election that the presidents 
working for 
bush likes to tell audiences that a good budget deal is the best 
antidote to a lagging economy new englands economy has lagged 
more than most 
after being the strongest during the reagan years the regions 
economy is now one of the nations weakest 
of the six new england states the democratic governors of 
vermont massachusetts and connecticut all opted not to seek 
reelection the republican governor of rhode island was running 
far behind his democratic challenger in the polls and the gop 
governor of maine was in a tight race with his predecessor 
some economists have questioned the wisdom of a budget deal that 
cuts spending and increases taxes as both house and senate 
versions would do just as the nation seems to be sliding into a 
recession 
conventional economic wisdom is that the government should 
stimulate the economy when its weak 
but the administration argues that a sound budget deal will help 
the economy by driving interest rates down 
weve got to put this nation back on the path to longterm 
economic growth and the way to do that is to get a budget through 
and that will bring the interest rates down and that will put more 
and more americans back to work where they belong bush said in a 
recent political speech 
gone from either version of the 500 billion fiveyear deficit 
cutting package now before a housesenate conference committee is 
an earlier proposal that generated strong opposition in new 
england 
that was a 2centagallon tax on heating oil that was part of 
the package negotiated by the white house and congressional leaders 
but rejected by the house 
bushs new england tour was postponed from two weeks ago when 
he canceled it to remain in washington during an earlier stage of 
the budget crisis 
the presidents first stop was a fundraising breakfast for the 
state gop in burlington vt former gov richard snelling is 
favored to regain the office he gave up six years ago which would 
return vermont to republican control 
bush also was expected to put in a plug for rep peter smith 
the republican incumbent whose reelection bid is being challenged 
by former burlington mayor bernie sanders a socialist 
bush also planned to speak at a fundraising lunch for gop 
senate candidate rep robert c smith in manchester nh 
smith was heavily favored to capture the senate seat being 
vacated by fellow conservative gordon humphrey he is challenged by 
former democratic sen john durkin 
the president planned two campaign appearances in connecticut 
the first was a reception in waterbury for gop house candidate gary 
franks who is running for the congressional seat being vacated by 
gop gubernatorial candidate john rowland the democratic challenger 
is former rep toby moffett 
moffett gave up his house seat to run unsuccessfully for the 
senate in 1982 he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986 
bush also was to speak at a fundraising dinner for rowland in 
stamford rowland is in a threeway race for governor former 
republican sen lowell weicker running as an independent is 
leading in the polls while democratic rep bruce morrison has been 
trailing

droves of republican candidates are shunning 
television ads of themselves with president bush and theyve got 
their reasons 
they couldnt get to the white house for a taping the quality 
of the footage is bad they dont have money to buy the tv time 
endorsements dont work in their race 
and well maybe its not such a good idea to latch onto a guy 
whose ratings are slipping who promoted a wildly unpopular budget 
plan whos part of the washington establishment that this years 
candidates love to hate 
if something is radioactive your natural inclination is to 
stay away from it said craig tufty a spokesman for rep fred 
grandy riowa is there a bush endorsement in grandys future 
we dont have one said tufty and we dont plan on getting 
one 
bush has taped about 100 endorsement spots for republican house 
senate and gubernatorial candidates but an associated press spot 
check of campaigns across the country indicates few are finding 
their way onto the airwaves 
many candidates seem to be taking their cue from freshman rep 
jim mccrery of louisiana he scrapped plans to show his ad with 
bush before the states unique open primary on oct 6 instead he 
ran ads against bushs budget compromise 
mccrery coasted to reelection 10 points ahead of a democrat who 
had been expected to give him trouble and a winning strategy was 
born 
bush has been welcomed and feted all over the country as a 
cheerleader and fundraiser for the same candidates who have vetoed 
his onair presence the decision most often is explained 
diplomatically 
weve chosen to push johns agenda with our television ads 
rather than having the president do it for us said john 
truscott a spokesman for michigan gubernatorial candidate john 
engler 
were concentrating on wyoming issues rather than 
washington was a comment typical of many campaigns 
wed like to keep our advertising focused on the candidate 
was another 
some had other reasons a spokesman for wisconsin gov tommy g 
thompson said video footage of bushs june trip there was of such 
poor quality that it wont be aired and michigan state rep dave 
camp trying for an open house seat couldnt make a taping 
session they wanted us in washington the next day said his 
campaign manager john guzik 
several campaigns said they still dont know if theyll play 
their bush cards but they denied the presidents ratings would 
influence their decisions john hudgens campaign manager for 
arkansas gubernatorial candidate sheffield nelson was more blunt 
if hes ranking high in the polls and very popular thats one 
thing hudgens said of bush but if hes dropping in the polls 
it would be silly for us to throw him up there his popularity is 
an issue 
a couple of politicians have figured out how to exploit bushs 
support while at the same declaring their independence from him 
sen larry pressler for example ran an ad incorporating film 
of bush complimenting the south dakota senator during a washington 
fundraiser but the ad also includes bushs comments that pressler 
doesnt always go along with the white house 
and rep al mccandless running against ralph pa walton 
waite near los angeles made an ad that says bush supports him even 
though he didnt support the presidents budget deal thats 
followed by a white house tape of bush saying nice things about 
mccandless 
that particular ad has not aired yet and may never but 
spokesman james moore said any mccandless tv in the heavily 
republican district will include bushs comments and the same type 
of disclaimer unfortunately he said i think we have to 
some candidates apparently feel bush still is popular enough to 
help them senate challenger allen kolstad of montana and nevada 
gubernatorial candidate jim gallaway are using endorsement spots 
with no caveats the president has been on tv in maine site of his 
beloved summer home for sen william cohen and house hopeful david 
emery 
hes on the air in nebraska too 
sen jim exon president bush says the announcer as the 
screen shows photographs of the two men putting politics aside 
and standing together and protecting our national security in the 
middle east and at home 
exon certainly transcended politics in that ad hes a democrat

warm welcome in the past two years said vincent in philadelphia 
for mensas annual board of directors meeting 
they examined us carefully he said once they found we 
were about intellectual pursuits and we were not politically 
affiliated they welcomed us 
for years mensa was unable to break through the many 
bureaucratic layers set up by communist leaders vincent said 
a lot of correspondence was mostly one way he said 
sometimes it would take six months to get a response from the 
government in moscow and more often than not it was just a 
referral to another government agency 
but once the political changes began the new governments 
found little difficulty with us he said 
most eastern europeans interested in joining mensa are in their 
20s usually working at universities or training academies 
they are more psychologically capable than older eastern 
europeans in seeking out mensa vincent said 
the past three generations have been restricted in making 
choices all their lives he said a 52yearold might be 
interested in joining but he might find it difficult to express 
his desires

the persian gulf crisis is putting 
a severe strain on the tiny nations of the caribbean whose frail 
economies and scant natural resources make them highly vulnerable 
to higher oil prices 
except for trinidad and tobago which produces just under 1 
percent of the worlds oil and stands to benefit from higher 
prices most of the developing nations of the region are heavily 
dependent on foreign oil suriname and barbados also produce some 
oil but not enough for domestic demand 
when the price of crude doubled to about 40 a barrel after iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 the ripple effects in the caribbean 
included higher food utility and transportation costs 
dollars to pay interest on foreign debt also became more scarce 
the prices have gone up at a time when we are struggling to 
deal with very difficult economic problems said frank abdulah 
deputy secretarygeneral of the 13nation caribbean economic 
community or caricom it has clearly taken its toll on the 
caribbean community 
oil prices tumbled monday below 29 but the longterm direction 
remains unclear analysts said 
the current situation reminds us of how extremely vulnerable 
our small nation is jamaican prime minister michael manley told 
reporters recently this has grave implications for the jamaican 
economy since we are completely dependent on imported oil 
manley said the gulf crisis would affect all jamaican economic 
projections including discussions with the international monetary 
fund on jamaicas 45 billion foreign debt 
another hardhit country is the dominican republic where 
consumer prices were sharply raised in august under a government 
plan to control runaway inflation the program touched off 
nationwide strikes and clashes between protesters and security 
forces in which at least 60 people were killed 
unable to pay higher oil prices the dominican government cut 
imports by 40 percent and introduced rationing causing long gas 
lines 
the deteriorating situation prompted a flurry of media reports 
about rumors of a possible coup against president joaquin balaguer 
the nations blind 84yearold leader both the military and 
balaguers cabinet have strongly denied the existence of any 
movement to overthrow the government 
balaguer told the nation recently there is a delicate 
situation not only in the dominican republic but all over the 
world the only countries enjoying stability today are 
oilproducing nations 
none of these minicountries are politically strong enough 
to weather serious economic adversity without remarkable 
consequences said larry birns director of the council on 
hemispheric affairs a washingtonbased think tank 
and these consequences could include replacement of 
governments with opposition parties and at the very worse 
military regimes 
in guyana one of the hemispheres poorest nations prime 
minister hamilton green said higher fuel prices could exhaust 
earnings from the countrys main exports sugar rice and bauxite 
for the bauxite industry we use a lot of fuel and diesel 
for those huge kilns and this has had a very bad effect on the 
economy green said in an interview this whole thing has gone 
out of kilter 
elsewhere antigua has raised electricity rates and according 
to the monthly news magazine caribbean insight at least one 
shipping line operating in the british virgin islands has raised 
cargo rates 
concern also has been raised about the possibility of higher air 
fares which could hurt tourism the economic lifeblood of many 
caribbean islands 
one would hope the duration of the middle east crisis is 
shortlived said luther miller of the barbadosbased caribbean 
tourism organization but hopefully it will be more expensive to 
drive than to fly 
with substantial oil reserves the twinisland nation of 
trinidad and tobago could reap a windfall industry minister bhoe 
tewarie said a sustained price increase of just 1 would pump 50 
million a year into the treasury 
but he said the government wanted to reduce its dependency on 
oil wealth and had no plan to significantly increase production 
widespread poverty in trinidad since the collapse of oil prices 
in the early 1980s was cited by moslem rebels who stormed 
parliament in august and staged an abortive coup and sixday 
hostage siege 
rafeeuddin ahmed the un undersecretarygeneral for 
international economic and social affairs said monday that higher 
oil prices will be an unbearable additional burden for some 
third world and eastern european nations 
the imf is said to be studying ways to help developing nations 
caught in the gulf squeeze but is not expected to produce a new 
round of lending 
in the 1970s the energy crisis caused overborrowing and that 
resulted in the debt crisis said one financial source in 
washington speaking on condition of anonymity but borrowing 
should not be a way out of this crisis these countries are going 
to have to bite the bullet and adjust their policies to reflect the 
high cost of oil

it took a texan to spice up nebraskas 
lackluster us senate campaign 
the race between twoterm democratic sen jim exon and 
republican hal daub came to life when john tower came to town 
tower a former texas senator arrived to campaign for daub 
still nursing a grudge over the senates 1989 vote to reject his 
nomination to be secretary of defense exon had opposed towers 
nomination 
sen exon bore down on me heavily on the drinking thing when 
hes got the reputation in washington of being one of the two or 
three biggest boozers in the senate tower said 
exon denied the innuendo that he was a heavy drinker and said it 
was typical of daubs desperate dirty tactics but daubs camp 
said it had nothing to do with towers comments 
if my opponent continues to harp on this so much i think hell 
be making it into an issue when in fact it is not our intention 
nor has it ever been our intention that it be an issue daub 
said 
democratic leaders said towers comments created a backlash 
against daub 
and once the rumors about exon had been raised daubs personal 
life also came under scrutiny 
daub was asked about a 1978 incident in which he suffered a stab 
wound in his home daub had said he fell and stabbed himself in the 
arm but rumors of a domestic incident persisted 
daub who served four terms in the us house and ran 
unsuccessfully for the senate in 1988 was visibly miffed and 
walked out of a news conference when the 1978 incident was raised 
exon who insists he has never been drunk said medication he 
had taken years ago for gall bladder problems may have made him 
appear tipsy 
that prompted daub to call on exon to release his medical 
records 
which prompted exon to suggest that daub should release his 
family records a veiled reference to the domestic rumors 
democrats see the tower incident as a sign of desperation on the 
part of daub who trailed exon in polls published before the tower 
remarks 
hal daub is in the tenth round of a fight and he has lost nine 
rounds so he decided to bet everything on one of his patented low 
blows said democratic state chairman mike dugan 
daub refused to give the apology demanded by exon but said he 
did regret towers remarks if anything daub said exon should be 
the one to apologize for his previous treatment of tower in 
opposing towers nomination exon had cited towers past drinking 
habits 
hal daub didnt initiate this and in a way john tower 
didnt either said daub spokesman al meyer 
before the tower incidentexon and daub had campaigned on 
issues such as agriculture taxes and defense 
exon cited his congressional seniority and committee 
assignments including his chairmanship of an armed services 
subcommittee important to the bellevuebased strategic air command 
he also stressed his role in stopping denvers two forks dam 
project work helping to keep rural air service for nebraska and a 
voting record that he said reflected nebraskas values 
daub said president bush needs republican support in the senate 
and bush and vice president dan quayle have visited nebraska to 
campaign for him he depicts exon as part of the old politics of 
the democratic party which daub blames for the federal deficit and 
other problems 
daub also has stressed his decision to refuse contributions from 
political action committees although he took more than 1 million 
in pac money in earlier campaigns daub said his brief political 
layoff after being defeated by sen david karnes in 1988 convinced 
him that the pac system was corrupting politics 
exon campaign manager chuck pallesen said daub accepted money 
from outofstate republican organizations that use loopholes to 
get around the pac laws while acting as pacs daub denied that and 
said exons acceptance of pac contributions was evidence of his 
politicsofthepast mentality 
each candidates campaign reported spending about 1 million 
this year as of oct 1 however daub entered the final weeks of 
the campaign 32000 in debt while exon had 670000 available

navy investigators of rape and sexual assault 
cases at a naval training center in florida may have sexually 
harassed the victims whose allegations they were investigating 
according to an internal report 
the report by the navys inspector general said it appeared that 
agents of the naval investigative service or nis needed better 
training in how to interrogate sex crime victims 
the nis said in response that it was arranging more 
sensitivity training 
the report released monday by the department of the navy said 
investigations of sex crimes at the orlando naval training center 
could be improved if the nis used more women agents there nis said 
it would do so despite its fear of creating the perception that 
certain assignments are womens work 
navy inspectors who compiled the report on orlando said they 
were told by the company commanders of some rape and sexual assault 
victims that the women were revictimized during questioning by 
nis agents it did not elaborate on that point except to say that 
the agents questioned the veracity of statements made by the 
victims 
there is a possibility that some victims may have recanted 
statements to avoid further contact with nis the report said 
rep beverly byron dmd chairwoman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on military personnel and compensation said 
the sheer number of cases at the orlando center 13 in a year and 
a half reflects a serious problem 
eight rape cases and no prosecution five sexual assaults 
theres got to be a breakdown in leadership and oversight she 
said if you had one case maybe two which are intolerable it 
wouldnt be as blatant as this many cases 
the report written last july said many company commanders at 
the orlando center use sexual harassment to intimidate recruits a 
condition that sends a strong signal to developing sailors that 
such behavior is acceptable 
the navy which has come under fire on many fronts recently for 
its treatment of women recruits and sailors said it acted swiftly 
to correct the problems at orlando 
the navy inspector generals report said that eight rape and 
five indecent assault cases were substantiated or resolved at 
the orlando training center in the 18 months ended june 30 none of 
the rape cases was prosecuted 
the navy public affairs office at the pentagon declined to 
release an accompanying document explaining how each of the rape 
and indecent assault cases was concluded the inspector generals 
report mentioned the outcome of just four cases two were dropped 
because the victims made false statements one was dropped because 
the victim refused to be crossexamined in a navy investigation 
and another was dropped because the suspect was transferred from 
orlando 
the office of rear admiral louise wilmot commander of the 
training center released a statement saying every report of an 
alleged incident is immediately investigated but if there is 
insufficient evidence the accused cannot be prosecuted 
the base statement said no instructors or supervisors were 
involved in the alleged rape cases in all cases they were 
classmates acquaintances or peers it said 
the chief of education and training for the navy vice adm john 
s disher wrote in a letter accompanying the inspector generals 
report that the orlando center had managed to cut down on incidents 
of sexual harassment nevertheless this report indicates that 
much more must be done in orlando within the naval education and 
training center and presumably throughout the entire navy 
disher rote 
the inspectors said they discovered that nis agents are given 
only a onetime training session on conducting interrogations of 
sex crime victims although they also receive rape awareness 
training 
in response to the criticism of his agents rear adm thomas 
brooks director of nis wrote in a letter to disher that his 
office is trying to arrange for additional sensitivity training 
for interrogators he pledged to personally assure that the 
sensitivity issue is central to agents training

a us marine with a fondness for 
rock n roll on the firing line isnt referring to a song its 
the boomboomboom of cannon and rattattat of machine guns that 
gets things moving 
this is music to our ears although other people get very 
nervous when they hear it said col james fulks operations and 
training officer of the 1st marine expeditionary force 
anytime theres live fire the marines are going to be 
excited these guys are going to be so pumped itll take a week 
for them to come back down said fulks 44 peering through his 
binoculars at targets down range 
marines did their shooting monday on a practice range cleared on 
the desolate wasteland in northeastern saudi arabia 
after bulldozers carved out a line in the sand marines shooed 
away bedouins camels and goats from their target zone and fired 
the 25mm cannon and m60 machine guns that are mounted on their 
light armored vehicles 
this is what we get paid for said cpl hugh roop 25 if 
were just sitting around it doesnt make us feel that were 
earning our money 
the range this day belonged to alpha co of the 1st light 
infantry battalion which is based at camp pendleton calif 
soldiers let loose barrage after barrage at 55gallon drums and 
other targets as far as 3000 feet away 
it was the first livefire exercise for this company since it 
arrived in august as part of operation desert shield 
the marines routinely train in the desert back home but the 
harshness of saudi sand takes some getting used to whenever 
possible soldiers sought shade under their vehicles and drank 
copious amounts of water 
at midday the temperature hit 106 degrees inside the belly of 
their armored scout vehicles it was 2030 degrees hotter for 
soldiers outfitted with mandatory flak jackets 
its like an oven said cpl craig smith 22 of lafayette 
ind but its a lot better than walking doing the humping 
regular grunts do id rather be riding 
smith relished the action even if it was practice 
it breaks the monotony we finally got a chance to go out and 
bust some caps break the pressure a little bit and release some 
frustration smith said 
as one way to battle the boredom marines with canteen cups 
captured the little black scorpions that thrive in the saudi 
desert recently theyve been getting some recreation time at rear 
areas movies on vcrs pool tables reading material 
theyre also getting two hot meals a day and plenty of mail 
they take about three showers a week including those juryrigged 
from water bottles 
one enterprising sergeant even produced a container of tang to 
mix drinks for reporters 
marines who have been out in the desert for months had questions 
of their own for the media 
are there vietnamtype demonstrations back home does the public 
support them how long will they be here what college football 
team is number one what are saudi cities like all they see is 
sand 
its important for us to know that people support us 
otherwise wed feel like we were all alone roop said

john maynard keynes might not approve but 
many private economists believe the bush administration and 
congress are right in backing budget cuts and tax increases even in 
the face of a possible recession 
that view flies in the face of a major economic tenet advanced 
by keynes who argued that cutting government spending and 
increasing taxes is the wrong thing to do in economic hard times 
instead the late british economist contended the government 
should run deficits during recessions to prime the pump and 
encourage a shrinking economy to start growing again 
in the emerging budget deal congress would cut spending 
throughout government raise income taxes on the wealthy and hike 
the federal gasoline tax all in the name of shrinking the deficit 
by 40 billion in the current budget year and by 500 billion over 
the next five years 
economists who support this shock therapy concede that economic 
growth at least in the shortterm will be hurt by the tax hikes 
and spending cuts perhaps even making a mild recession slightly 
worse 
but they argue that the longterm benefits outweigh the 
shortterm pain 
when things are this far out of kilter with the budget 
deficit soaring the benefits of solving the underlying structural 
problem outweigh the shortterm damage said david wyss senior 
financial economist at drimcgraw hill 
however supplyside critics of the effort charge that george 
bush is in danger of becoming a modernday herbert hoover that 
republican president preached the need for budgetary restraint as a 
response to the worsening economic situation of the early 1930s 
the deficitcutters have a simplistic notion that if the 
medicine doesnt taste good then just swallow hard and you will 
feel better in the morning i dont think that is true said john 
makin an economist with the conservative american enterprise 
institute 
supporters of the deficit package contend that the loss in 
purchasing power from higher taxes and lower government spending 
can be offset by lower interest rates engineered by the federal 
reserve whose chairman alan greenspan has given his blessing to 
the deficitcutting deal 
in addition supporters say the deficit deal has been crafted so 
that the biggest tax and spending changes will occur in later 
years presumably when the economy will be better able to withstand 
the changes 
in the current budget year the administration and congress are 
looking for only 40 billion in tax increases and spending cuts 
this total likely will reduce economic growth as measured by 
the gross national product by less than onehalf percentage point 
over the next year analysts said 
to the extent that it is contractionary it is fairly easy for 
the fed to offset that and the longer term results of the package 
will be expansionary said harvard economist martin feldstein 
who fell out of favor as president reagans chief economist when he 
advocated tax increases to narrow the deficit 
with economic growth already slowed to a nearstandstill even 
analysts who support the deficit package believe it will worsen any 
recession in the next year 
there is no question that the deficitcutting package will 
slow the economy further but that is the price we are paying for 
letting the deficits reach these levels and not dealing with the 
problem when the economy was stronger said lawrence chimerine 
president of radnor consulting services an economic forecasting 
firm 
we are risking some economic pain and difficulty in the short 
run but our country needs to make the sacrifice in order to get 
these deficits down added allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said he believed it was a mistake to 
count on the feds power to bail out the economy quickly with lower 
interest rates given the long lag times between changes in fed 
credit policies and their impact on spending and borrowing 
decisions 
jones said he believed a recession the first one in eight 
years began in august and could end up being fairly severe 
lasting until the end of 1991

the birthplace of retired bandleader lawrence 
welk is getting 500000 in rural development money for tourism 
from the 522 billion approved by the house for agriculture 
appropriations this fiscal year 
the spending bill worked out by a housesenate conference 
committee and approved by voice vote monday in the house covers 
most of the operations of the agriculture department and the food 
and drug administration 
but special attention was given to the appropriation for welks 
birthplace strasburg nd by rep silvio conte rmass who 
opposed the spending 
thats right ah one ah two ah three ah four ah half a 
million dollars said conte mimicking the way welk used to 
direct his orchestra what will they do for an encore earmark 
funds to renovate guy lombardos speedboat or restore artie shaws 
wedding tuxedo 
the money was included in the bill by the senate to help 
revitalize strasburg a 700person community in southcentral north 
dakota but conte and rep richard durbin dill both conference 
committee members went on record as opposing the strasburg 
appropriation before signing the compromise bill 
the money is to be used by welk heritage inc and the strasburg 
economic development corp to renovate the welk family home and 
help build a motel and other facilities to accommodate the tourist 
trade that is beginning to develop around the bandleaders former 
residence 
many rural communities where farms have been consolidated over 
the years causing a loss of economic base are looking to the 
government for help to develop other businesses 
about half the money in the bill 276 billion goes to feeding 
programs including 19 billion for food stamps and 25 billion 
for the women infant and children program 
food donations the special milk program and child nutrition 
programs also are covered by the bill 
the bill appropriates 5 billion for farm subsidies this year 
and continues the crop insurance program which had been stripped 
from the original house bill 
since 1980 the crop insurance program has lost over 26 
billion in indemnity payments said rep jamie whitten dmiss 
chairman of the house appropriations committee the 
administration in the past 10 years increased over 2 billion an 
increase of over 450 percent 
but at the urging of the senate whitten agreed to allow the 
program to continue if it is at least 75 percent actuarially sound 
and if usdas agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
takes control over policy sales and loss adjustments 
the ascs had controlled the program until 1980 when it was 
expanded to allow private insurance companies to issue policies to 
farmers the practice became costly because the private companies 
were reimbursed by the government for administrative expenses and 
operating losses 
specific agencies and their appropriations are 
farmers home administration 115 billion 
rural electrification administration 3346 million 
soil conservation service 7713 million 
agriculture stabilization and conservation service 15 
billion 
international programs including food giveaways 11 billion

two house agriculture subcommittee chairmen 
are opposing a chicago board of trade plan to double the number of 
grain and soybean futures contracts available to speculators 
rep dan glickman dkan said monday that such changes should 
not be made until the effects of the 1990 farm bill are known 
the bill which establishes new planting options as part of 
government budget cutting will dramatically change the commodities 
market said glickman chairman of the wheat soybeans and feed 
grains subcommittee 
he and rep glenn english dokla whose subcommittee oversees 
the commodity futures trading commission have asked the cftc to 
withhold approval of the chicago board of trade plan until next 
year 
the farm bill has been approved by a housesenate conference 
committee but awaits final votes in both chambers and the 
presidents signature 
in a letter to cftc chairman wendy gramm the chairmen said the 
chicago board of trade plan appears to be response to pressure from 
big commodity trading fund managers 
the funds have little interest in the price discovery or 
legitimate hedging functions of these markets and view them simply 
as another speculative venture to market to their customers the 
lawmakers wrote 
we do not believe the commission should approve the proposal 
until its proponents can verify with certainty that it will enhance 
the performance of these markets and allay fears that it will 
simply subject grain producers marketers and users to 
unnecessary damaging price fluctuations they added

a white supremacist says a 125 million 
verdict against himself and his followers over the slaying of a 
black man will leave him broke but free to preach violence 
without fear of being sued again 
a jury monday found that tom metzger a former grand dragon of 
the ku klux klan and his white aryan resistance incited the 
slaying by skinhead toughs 
the jury ordered metzger and his followers to pay the family of 
mulugeta seraw the entire 125 million sought on its behalf by the 
southern poverty law center of montgomery ala 
back home we say it cleans his plow said morris dees an 
attorney for the law center the first thing were going to do is 
send a moving van to his house so we can take it over 
metzger a 52yearold tv repairman from fallbrook calif said 
those responsible for the wrongfuldeath lawsuit made a fatal 
mistake 
ill be broke and under the constitution i can advocate 
violence now and nobody can sue me anymore so all the things im 
accused of that i didnt do i can do now he said 
seraw a 27yearold ethiopian who planned to attend school in 
oregon was attacked on the street in 1988 his head was split open 
with a softball bat 
the multnomah county jury deliberated about five hours before 
reaching the verdict on an 111 vote ten whites a 
japaneseamerican and a hawaiian served on the panel 
the jury found that metzger incited the slaying by sending a 
follower to portland to teach skinheads to commit violence against 
minorities metzger who was in california at the time faced no 
criminal charges in the case 
metzger was ordered to pay at least 5 million his group 3 
million and his son john 22 1 million two skinheads who 
pleaded guilty were assessed 500000 each it wasnt immediately 
clear how the remaining 25 million was to be apportioned among 
the defendants 
this jury i believe has said there will be a new season for 
justice in the northwest and the hate and violence as preached by 
tom metzger hopefully will be shut down forever said dees who 
had made no secret of his intent to bankrupt metzger 
three years ago dees won a 7 million verdict that bankrupted a 
klan faction in alabama he had sued on behalf of the mother of a 
19yearold black man slain by two klansmen 
metzger and his son represented themselves in the lawsuit 
dees and metzger said metzger doesnt have nearly enough money 
to pay the judgment metzger said earlier that his family lives on 
1200 a month 
he said he probably will appeal 
the white racist movement will not be stopped in a puny town 
like portland he said i think they the plaintiffs shot 
themselves in the foot and as conditions change in the country i 
think youre going to see it 
seraws father seraw tekuneh who flew in from ethiopia for the 
trial said through an interpreter this is the happiest i feel 
since my son died because i know he has not died in vain

increasing numbers of immigrants from ireland 
poland and italy will be among 21 million people permitted to 
enter the united states over the next three years under legislation 
nearing final approval 
staff members in the senate and house said monday there were no 
further obstacles and the bill was expected to pass in a few days 
we have reached overall agreement on a substantial increase in 
employmentsponsored immigration expanded familybased 
immigration including an emphasis on immediate families and a 
permanent diversity program said rep bruce a morrison 
dconn chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on 
immigration 
there will be a minimum of 48000 immigrants from ireland an 
additional 72000 will come from 33 other countries which have been 
able to send comparatively few people to the united states in 
recent years there were no specific numbers for poland or italy 
this movement toward diversity will also favor people from 
southern asia additional immigrants are expected from south korea 
and japan although these countries are not specifically named in 
the bill 
the new law will also encourage africans to come to the united 
states for the first time of their own free will 
some 420000 workers professionals and members of their 
immediate families will be admitted in the next three years because 
they possess needed skills of these 36000 will be employees of 
american companies in hong kong pressure for emigration is 
increasing in the british colony as the time nears for it to be 
turned over to china in 1997 
under present us law the total admitted on the basis of 
skills would be only 162000 for the three years the increase was 
due to pressure within the united states to compete with australia 
canada and other countries that have sought immigrants who would 
boost their economies 
the number of visas for nonrefugees would be 700000 a year for 
three years of these 465000 would be relatives of people already 
in the united states the basis for nine of every 10 foreigners 
recently admitted to live here 
in 1995 and afterwards there would be 675000 visas including 
480000 for relatives the number admitted to bring in additional 
skills would continue at 140000 a year 
an annual 55000 would be allowed in to maintain diversity of 
origin with no specific countries named the new law would keep 
the present annual limit of 20000 per country of origin for 
nonrefugees in recent years china mexico the philippines and 
india have regularly reached this limit 
under a different provision president bush sets an annual 
figure for the additional admittance of refugees 131000 for the 
year that began oct 1 including 52000 from east asia and 50000 
from the soviet union 
last year 1090000 foreigners were legally admitted to the 
united states according to the immigration and naturalization 
service the figure was abnormally large because it included many 
mexicans and central americans who were already living here 
illegally and were granted amnesty under a new law

the house is backing a spending bill that 
provides money for new programs to combat aids but falls short of 
the hefty amount approved earlier this year as the deadly disease 
claimed the life of ryan white 
by a vote of 33574 monday the house approved a 182 billion 
appropriations bill for the departments of labor education and 
health and human services for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the measure includes 226 million to partially fund a newly 
authorized program to help cities and local governments deal with 
the aids epidemic but that was far less than the 875 million 
authorized by a separate bill enacted earlier this year 
that emergency aids treatment bill was dedicated in memory of 
white an indiana teenager whose fight against the disease which 
he contracted from a blood transfusion gained national attention 
overall the bill is the secondlargest appropriations measure 
before congress behind only the defense department spending bill 
it must be approved by the senate before being sent to president 
bush 
the bill 7 billion more than requested by the administration 
represents an increase of 226 billion in spending for the three 
departments and related independent agencies 
the measure retains the prohibition on the use of federal money 
for abortions for poor women except when the mothers life is in 
danger 
abortionrights advocates had hoped to add language expanding 
that exception to include cases of rape and incest a move that 
prompted bush to veto the bill a year ago when it passed the house 
and senate 
but they were stymied when the senate added language to that 
provision that would have required parental notification before a 
teenage girl could obtain an abortion at any hospital or clinic 
receiving federal money 
supporters of legal abortions decided to drop efforts to add the 
money for rapeandincest abortions rather than accept the parental 
notification provision both provisions were removed in the 
conference committee 
in other action monday the house 
voted to spend 522 billion on farming nutrition and rural 
development programs by voice vote the house accepted compromises 
worked out by conferees on the appropriations bill that pays for 
farm subsidies and most agriculture department functions as well 
as the food and drug administration 
approved 34367 a bill providing 209 billion for the 
treasury department us postal service and offices of the 
president the bill provides all federal civilian employees 
except members of congress federal judges and the highestranking 
officials in the executive branch with a 41 percent pay raise 
it also includes an overhaul of the federal pay system 
including provisions aimed at adjusting salaries to take into 
account geographic differences in pay for private employees 
in the senate meanwhile a 155 billion foreign aid bill 
became snagged in a dispute over whether the united states should 
continue a policy that bars aid to international population 
agencies that offer abortion as an option 
earlier the senate voted to give israel at least 700 million 
worth of us weaponry the aid was added to legislation that 
already includes 3 billion in cash for israel and several other 
noncash benefits worth hundreds of million more israel is the 
largest recipient of us foreign aid

in summer readytowear shows by a raft of big 
names from chanel to dior loose jackets were emphasized over what 
has become the obligatory tight body stocking 
karl lagerfeld at chanel put the houses old image to rest in 
his show monday except for piping the quilt bag and pearls 
cocos old standbys are gone but lagerfelds quilted bags are made 
of flashy leather and he spruced the pearls up with colored beads 
he topped hot pants minis bicycle tights and leggings with 
every imaginable jacket showing scoop necks or various lapels and 
making it all work in hot shades and blackandwhite 
lagerfeld found a new kind of piping in little squares very 
attractive in a cream shade of yellow leather on a jacket worn with 
a circlelink gold belt and inevitable black stretch suit 
looser jackets almost floated in shades of peach or red over 
tiny knifepleated skirts and the loosening up was wonderful in 
silly tucked nightshirt tunics over differentshaded leggings 
jeanlouis scherrer again proved himself a master of wildanimal 
prints his tiny shorts dusterstyle coats lean pants and fitted 
suits had the african imprint that he dressed up for evening wear 
in sequins 
the wellcut clothes had terrific cachet for all ages even the 
fitted glen plaid jacket with its unmatched blackandwhite fish 
print crepe short skit could be worn around town by anybody 
gianfranco ferres collection for dior looked both bodyhugging 
and loose with floaty toppers over slim sheaths leading off with 
a line of ochre prints ferre put plenty of care into the 
collection though it didnt always look quite on the mark 
however his billowy organza blouses were beautiful and loose 
silky tunics with split sides in appealing shades of pink and 
apricot would be easy to wear at home while the multicolored 
lameandbrocade figured silks had a certain oriental splendor 
hanae mori won praise for a young and sweet collection starting 
with wide trapeze beach coats printed with japanese motifs her 
leather suits revealing a bit of bosom with no blouse underneath 
were daring for the japanese doyenne of french fashion 
scottishborn alistair blairs first readytowear collection 
for the house of balmain made little splash though he showed a few 
good ideas 
blair concentrated on classic casual looks in big pearlbuttoned 
tunics and shirtwaiststyle jackets sometimes with sleeves 
buttoned off or on 
sonia rykiel offered a calm for the stressedout fashion psyche 
as she turned out her usual sophisticated line of wonderful knits 
and sophisticated trousersuit outfits 
the favorite skirt line was a loose pullover and perhaps a 
tunic fitted around the little skirts all were hiphugging and 
slightly bunched or draped 
meanwhile kenzo celebrated the 20th year of his house sunday as 
the first japanese to set up shop here with a sensational show and 
party in the school of fine arts 
about halfway through the show the stage was set up to look 
like a neapolitan street scene complete with guitarists an 
icecream stand and cafe drinks for the models 
peppy innovations for women featured swirly longskirted 
outfits worn with easy contrasting shirts harking back to the late 
1950s 
a party lasting until the wee hours of monday morning numbered 
among its guests paloma picasso model ines de la fressange on the 
arm of christian lacroix angelo tarlazzi and issey miyake

the senate ethics committee already under 
republican fire for footdragging is considering a midnovember 
public hearing in the keating five cases that would delay any 
decision until well after the nov 6 elections 
if the committee took that course at a meeting today one 
republican and four democratic senators would remain under 
investigation at election time for their assistance to savings and 
loan figure charles h keating jr 
republicans on monday demanded a swift preelection decision on 
a special counsels proposal that two of the five including lone 
republican john mccain of arizona be dropped from the 
investigation 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the committee members have discussed the public hearing idea and 
could decide on that course when the committee deliberates today 
it takes four votes to advance the investigation from the current 
preliminary stage 
special counsel robert s bennett has recommended that the 
investigation continue against democratic sens alan cranston of 
california dennis deconcini of arizona and donald w riegle jr of 
michigan he proposed that probes of mccain and sen john glenn 
dohio be dropped 
the committee is trying to determine whether there is a 
connection between the five senators intervention with banking 
regulators for keating the former owner of the failed lincoln 
savings and loan association and the 13 million in political 
donations they received from him and his associates 
the irvine califbased thrift was seized by the federal 
government in april 1989 and it may cost taxpayers more than 2 
billion to cover the losses 
one source noted that senators will return in midnovember for 
party organizational meetings and predicted a hearing would be held 
at that time without any decision this week to advance or drop the 
probe among any senator 
the investigation took on partisan overtones on the senate floor 
monday republicans complained bitterly that there were inexcusable 
delays democrats countered that the gop was selectively leaking 
material that damaged cranston deconcini and riegle 
mccain began the round of republican complaints monday 
contending that the process has a credibility problem because 
the special counsels report has been gathering dust for six 
weeks 
he said there is a continued suspicion of an intentional 
failure to act on the recommendation before the election there 
is far more at stake here than just my reputation it is the 
reputation of the united states senate he said 
mccain made clear that he blamed ethics committee chairman 
howell heflin dala and said the panels vice chairman sen 
warren rudman rnh has tried unsuccessfully to move the 
investigation along 
but heflin countered that senators had work conflicts that 
delayed a ruling last week and he charged there was an organized 
campaign of leaks damaging to three democratic senators whom he 
did not identify 
documents obtained last week by the associated press and others 
showed that cranston deconcini and riegle had a much closer 
relationship with keating than they had previously acknowledged 
heflin said it is interesting to note that the leak of 
documents has been confined to three senators and that there has 
been no leak of documents about the two other 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine added it 
is particularly disturbing that the leaks have been limited to 
accusations against members of the democratic party although the 
preliminary investigation now under way involves members of both 
parties 
but republican leader bob dole of kansas said here we are the 
week of adjournment and two of our colleagues mccain and glenn 
have sort of been hung out to dry i simply believe that it is time 
to take action

delay a court motion on an everglades pollution suit 
martinez said monday he did not know of any attempt by the white 
house to hold back a us justice department motion that would ask 
a federal judge to declare florida in violation of its own 
waterquality laws and hold the state responsible for damage to the 
everglades 
unidentified sources say the motion has been ready for five 
weeks but was delayed because it could hurt martinezs reelection 
bid the orlando sentinel said in a story published sunday 
the fact that nobody wants to step forward and give their name 
clearly shows its a political statement by someone who wants to 
make a living out of lawsuits said martinez 
my function as governor is to clean up the everglades 
okeechobee and kissimmee thats what ive been doing said 
martinez who has sought to portray himself as an environmentalist

handgun control activist sarah brady 
urged florida voters to approve a constitutional amendment 
requiring a threeday waiting period for the sale of handguns 
voters will decide on nov 6 if they want to add the provision 
to the state constitution which would make florida the first state 
with a constitutionally mandated waiting period 
mrs brady the wife of former presidential press secretary 
james brady has campaigned nationally for stricter gun control 
laws since her husband was critically wounded in the 1981 
assassination attempt on president reagan 
supporters of amendment two said the provision would block the 
sale of handguns to angry or depressed people coupled with the 
immediate background check on handgun purchases the florida 
department of law enforcement should have in place by early next 
year they said the amendment would also help limit the exportation 
of weapons

negotiators on a military spending bill are at 
odds with congress armed services committees over president bushs 
plan for fullscale development of the air forces advanced 
tactical fighter 
house and senate bargainers were still working out final aspects 
of a 268 billion package for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
with hopes of formally submitting the legislation today 
earlier in the process negotiators from the congressional 
appropriations committees adopted several provisions that vastly 
differ from a separate defense authorization bill worked out last 
week by members of the senate and house armed services committees 
in that bill lawmakers agreed to bushs fiscal 1991 budget 
request for fullscale development of the advanced tactical 
fighter the aircraft intended to replace the air forces f15 
the administration sought 283 million for fullscale 
development and 763 million to complete the demonstration and 
validation phase of the prototype aircraft 
the defense blueprint approved by house and senate negotiators 
last week provides 964 million for the program but prohibits 
fullscale development this fiscal year the bargainers stressed 
the need for the air force to finish demonstrating several 
technologies before beginning fullscale development 
negotiators on the spending bill agreed to the administrations 
request for fullscale development one year after expressing 
concerns about the program 
in his major aircraft review defense secretary dick cheney 
announced his revised plans for the new fighter which included 
delaying purchases from 1994 to 1996 the pentagon plans to buy 750 
of the planes 
among the measures in the spending bill are a troop cut of 
78500 from the 21 million men and women in uniform worldwide 
just over 900 million for the milstar communications satellite and 
no restrictive language on the strategic defense initiative 
program 
in the authorization bill that sets ceilings for military 
spending conferees last week approved a troop cut of 100000 and 
agreed to 600 million for milstar the negotiators also adopted 
language that limits spending on accounts within the sdi program 
thus delaying early deployment of the antimissile system 
congress is expected to approve the spending and authorization 
bills this week and send them to bush 
however the authorization bill faces a veto threat 
shortly after the package was announced cheney signaled he 
would recommend that bush veto the bill pentagon officials 
complained about the size of the troop cut the restrictive 
language on sdi and the wording on a baseclosure measure 
congressional aides and pentagon officials worked throughout the 
weekend and monday to modify the provisions to make them more 
acceptable to the administration 
a defense department official who requested anonymity said 
that some of the issues are moving toward resolution in a ay we 
would like were still leaning out there with a possibility of a 
veto

scientists believe they have turned back 
the first us invasion of killer bees but expect a new offensive 
in the spring 
authorities monday had not confirmed any new swarms in the week 
since they trapped the first of the africanized killer bees that 
crossed into the united states from mexico 
im going on the assumption that we wont find another swarm 
until spring said elba quintero area honey bee program manager 
for the us department of agricultures animal and plant health 
inspection service 
the weather is getting colder and bees do not normally move in 
winter time 
usda teams on friday started a search for bees within two miles 
of where the first swarm of 3000 was found and destroyed near the 
city of hidalgo they are taking samples of all managed and wild 
bee colonies in the area 
us and mexican officials in the past three years had placed 
hundreds of traps baited with a sex lure to track the bees which 
have been moving slowly north since 1957 when they escaped from a 
breeding experiment in brazil 
killer bees earned their nickname because of their habit of 
attacking intruders in swarms and chasing their prey for long 
distances 
beekeepers and farmers fear the killer bees will take over 
domestic hives and reduce honey production and pollination of 
important crops 
the swarm last week prompted a quarantine on movement of bees 
out of the twomile radius where the killer variety was found the 
quarantine also prohibits movement of bees from texas eight 
southernmost counties 
usda trapped two swarms during the weekend along the rio grande 
less than a mile from where the africanized swarm was caught but 
the bees probably are not africanized ms quintero said test 
results were expected today 
to the naked eye africanized bees are impossible to distinguish 
from the more docile european bees commonly raised in the americas

trains and crews on a brief stretch of conrail tracks between 
buffalo and niagara falls ny 
the consolidated rail corp called for binding arbitration in 
legal papers served late monday the action came hours after a

in the meantime the issue will be reviewed by the bankruptcy 
judge in wilmington del who has been overseeing the damph 
reorganization 
the approximately 15mile stretch is key to a 25 million offer 
by canadian pacific ltd to buy the ailing damph without access to

with its own lines in southern ontario 
canadian pacific hopes to use the damph system to connect the 
ports of philadelphia and new york with the canadian interior if 
cp can put the pieces together it will be compete directly with

through three years of law school and never be exposed to the legal 
problems of someone who cant afford a lawyer harvard law 
student steve donzinger a member of law students for pro bono 
said monday 
we are asking our educators to say these problems are 
important enough to incorporate into our education he said at a 
news conference here 
the group wants each of the nations 175 accredited law schools 
to incorporate a pro bono requirement into their traditional 
courses of legal study by 2000 lawyers and other professional 
dont charge for pro bono services 
donzinger said fewer than one in six lawyers or law students 
performs any pro bono work even though american bar association 
guidelines say its members should perform 50 hours of such work

israel already the top recipient of us 
foreign aid would be given at least 700 million worth of american 
arms under an addition approved by the senate with only a single 
dissenting vote 
the senate voted 971 monday to add the weaponry to a 155 
billion foreign aid bill that already includes 3 billion in cash 
for israel and several other noncash benefits worth hundreds of 
millions more 
however the overall bill is subject to further debate in the 
senate and its provisions also would have to be agreed to by the 
house before going to president bush 
the aid would come primarily from equipment being withdrawn from 
europe as eastwest tensions ease and must be committed within 
nine months unless doing so would jeopardize the readiness of us 
forces 
the sponsors sens daniel inouye dhawaii and robert kasten 
rwis contended that the help was needed to counter the threat of 
an attack on israel by iraq 
the best interest of this country is served by assuring the 
viability of israel inouye said citing that countrys free 
sharing of middle eastern intelligence with the united states it 
is the best ally we have 
but sen robert c byrd dwva the only senator to oppose the 
aid countered that the united states is not a bottomless pit of 
aid money 
no one can say this amendment should be passed because we have 
not done enough for israel said byrd who chairs the senate 
appropriations committee 
byrd criticized what he said was the fake psychology that 
any lawmaker who votes against a new benefit for tel aviv is an 
enemy of israel that attitude has been used to considerable 
advantage around here for years he complained 
the new israeli aid which inouye characterized as a message of 
support was an apparent attempt to counterbalance new aid to two 
arab countries 67 billion in debt forgiveness for egypt and a 
75 billion weapons sale to saudi arabia 
in addition to israels 18 billion in military and 12 
billion in economic aid the bill earmarks 21 billion for egypt 
72 million for morocco 382 million for greece and 545 million 
for turkey 
the measure became snagged later monday in a dispute over 
whether the united states should continue a policy that bars aid to 
international population agencies that offer abortion as an option 
sen tim wirth dcolo pressed an amendment that would remove 
the united states from a list of countries that signed the policy 
in 1984 sens william armstrong rcolo and gordon humphrey 
rnh threatened a filibuster over the proposal

researchers say cocaine has been found to speed 
the growth of the aids virus in the test tube prompting concern it 
could do the same in drug users 
researchers with the university of minnesota medical school at 
minneapolis took peripheral blood mononuclear cells and exposed 
them to doses of cocaine the cells are a primary target for the 
aids virus 
the virus was found to grow as much as three times faster in the 
cocainelaced tests 
in persons who are infected if they continue to abuse this 
drug it may have a significant impact on the development of 
clinical aids said dr ronald schut 
schut presented the findings at the interscience conference on 
antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy sponsored by the american 
society for microbiology 
while about 150000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states researchers say an additional million or more americans are 
infected and at risk of developing aids 
the question now for researchers is whether drug use somehow 
modifies the immune system to enhance growth of the aids or hiv 
virus 
the initial invitro testtube studies suggest that its 
possible schut said 
dr james curran director of the division of hivaids at the 
centers for disease control said little if any solid information 
is available on the risk aids poses cocaine users he said drug 
users are notoriously difficult to study 
however as far as cocaine is concerned curran said i think 
its safe to recommend dont do it 
further studies are under way using immune cells from drug users 
in a methadone program where cocaine use is high to see if the 
virus grows more easily schut said 
also at the conference doctors from los angeles kaiser 
permanente medical center reported that low doses of a common 
antibiotic can prevent a lifethreatening complication in aids 
patients pneumocystis pneumonia at much lower cost than the 
widely recommended aerosol pentamidine 
thrice weekly tablets of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole which is 
used frequently for mild bacterial infections prevented 
pneumocystis pneumonia in 116 highrisk patients for two years dr 
joel ruskin reported 
that drug can cost as little as 12 a year while aerosol 
pentamidine can cost hundreds the doctors said

enabling kasparov to keep his onepoint lead in the series 
the game ended monday night with karpov offering the defending 
champion a draw after his 36th move each player got a half point 
leaving the score 3 to 2 game 6 will be wednesday 
the first player to reach 12 points in the 24game series will 
win the championship kasparov who dethroned karpov in 1985 got a 
full point for his victory in the second game the three other 
games were draws 
on the 10th move karpov forced the exchange of his queen for 
kasparovs queen which many grandmasters thought was an attempt by 
karpov to play for a draw rather than a win 
when queens are traded off early in a game this often reduces 
the chances of an overwhelming attack by either player it also 
increases the boredom 
this is the most boring game they ever played said 
grandmaster roman dzindzichashvili of new york city 
international master vitaly zaltsman of new york city said of 
karpov this guy is chicken he has no fighting spirit 
the first 12 games are being played in new york and the rest 
will be played in lyon france the winner will receive 17

coalition of the left and progress 
final results released monday by the interior ministry showed 
that cosmopoulos received 5091 percent of the vote to 4909 
percent for fatouros 
the hardfought race in the key industrial city was considered a 
gauge of political sentiment for the national new democracyled

and offset 10 billion in debts 
the first round of mayoral elections was held on oct 14 with 
215 towns and cities involved on sunday runoffs were held in 143 
municipalties 
final results indicated that many leftist voters failed to toe 
the party line especially in athens salonica and in provincial 
areas considered socialistleftist strongholds 
but candidates supported by the socialistcommunist coalition 
took the next three biggest cities in the country piraeus near 
the capital patras in the southwest and iraklion on the island of 
crete 
on oct 14 the new democracysupported candidate in athens 
former socialist minister antonis tritsis edged out popular 
socialist parliamentarian melina mercouri 
former premier andreas papandreou who heads the socialist 
panhellenic socialist movement claimed the conservatives lost 4 
percent of their strength overall and called on his party to 
prepare for new general elections 
premier constantine mitsotakis dismissed the claims he said new

carrying a child does not make a woman 
a parent a judge ruled in awarding a testtube baby to the boys 
genetic parents instead of the surrogate they hired for 10000 
civil rights advocates and ethicists charged that the ruling 
monday by superior court judge richard parslow ignores the law and 
creates a breeder class of women 
the judge is saying gestation doesnt count it counts for 
nothing and i think that is a very disturbing outcome said 
susan m wolf an associate for law at the hastings center an 
ethics research institute in briarcliff manor ny 
in giving custody of the 5weekold boy to mark and crispina 
calvert instead of surrogate mother anna johnson the judge said 
a surrogate carrying a genetic child for a couple does not 
acquire parental rights 
parslow said ms johnson made a substantial contribution in 
giving birth to the child but her relationship to the baby was 
like a foster parent who takes a child in when the parent cant 
the judge said 
i think a threeparent twonatural mom claim in a situation 
is ripe for crazymaking he said i decline to split this 
child emotionally between two mothers 
the decision upholds a contract under which the calverts agreed 
to pay ms johnson to carry an embryo created from the couples 
sperm and egg a hysterectomy prevents mrs calvert 36 from 
carrying a baby 
we are entering into very dangerous times if we allow the 
creation of a breeder class of women whose parental rights can be 
signed away in a business deal said ramona ripston executive 
director of the american civil liberties union of southern 
california the aclu had urged the judge to rule all three adults 
were legitimate parents 
the ruling is a radical departure from the preexisting law 
said ms wolf said 
attorneys had said the dispute could break legal ground because 
a genetically unrelated surrogate never had sought custody new 
jerseys baby m case involved a surrogate who was also the babys 
genetic mother 
in that case a new jersey court awarded custody to the father 
and his wife but ruled that surrogate mother mary beth whitehead 
also had parental rights 
ms johnson 29 of mission viejo described herself as 
heartbroken over the ruling and said she would appeal to the 
supreme court if necessary to gain shared custody 
im in a deep state of mourning for my son hes going to be 
very confused hes going to be looking for me she said 
ms johnson was ordered to stop her twiceaweek visits to the 
baby who was in the calverts care since shortly after his sept 
19 birth 
i just held him close to me let him nuzzle up into my 
shoulder and whispered in his ear that mommys trying her hardest 
to get him back she said 
this is a glorious day said calvert 34 referring to ms 
johnsons argument that she had developed a bond with the infant 
he said the only bonding anna johnson has is with your 
television cameras 
christopher michael calvert will be the name entered on the 
childs birth certificate which was held up by the dispute the 
father said 
the judge said that ms johnson signed the 10000 contract 
knowing she was to give the child to the calverts they have paid 
her 5000 so far 
he also found that surrogate contracts in invitro fertilization 
cases are not void or in violation or public policy and he 
predicted the hunger by childless couples for their own 
children would spur more people to pursue similar arrangements

across the country voters are said to be 
on the brink of revolt over rising taxs politicians who dont 
lead schools that dont teach 
here in lincoln its cracked sidewalks 
residents of this city which is in the midst of a sixyear 
crackdown on cracks go to the polls nov 6 to consider two 
proposed city charter amendments dealing with who should pay for 
cityordered repairs the city or homeowners 
one ballot question asks voters whether the city should pay a 
second seeks reimbursement to property owners for repairs made 
since april 10 1989 when the sidewalk improvement campaign began 
the questions got on the ballot after allen boettcher a retired 
extension agent and 150 other volunteers collected the 3000 
signatures needed to give voters a say in who pays 
everybody uses the sidewalks but only property owners have to 
pay for the repairs said boettcher thats the great 
injustice 
sidewalk inspectors fanned out through the capital citys 
neighborhoods in april 1989 armed with cans of orange spray paint 
to circle cracks and raised edges 
the goal was to inspect and require repairs on all unsafe and 
broken sidewalks over a sixyear period to date the city has 
ordered repairs on about 7800 properties and new sidewalks for an 
additional 300 
the city council hoped to make sidewalks safer for people in 
wheelchairs the elderly children runners and walkers 
but boettcher said some homeowners have been forced to pay two 
or three times their city property taxes to have the sidewalks 
fixed 
refunds could cost the city between 800000 and 900000 city 
engineer rich robinson said 
he said that the city has to pay 40 to 48 to hire a contractor 
to build a 4by4foot sidewalk section and that property owners 
may be able to get the work done cheaper 
city attorney bill austin has suggested he will recommend legal 
challenges if voters approve the measures 
regardless of the outcome at the ballot box boettcher has 
caught the attention of mayor bill harris who has formed a 
committee of public officials and residents including boettcher 
to review the sidewalk repair campaign 
the campaign replaced a random program that required the filing 
of complaints about unsafe sidewalks to the public works 
department 
people think we have a new sidewalk policy and they have to 
pay for their sidewalks said linda wilson a city council 
member but thats always been the case 
councilman ken haar said passage of the measures could force the 
city to back down on its policy of requiring repairs 
boettcher who has had to repair one sidewalk section near his 
home said he supports repairs as long as the city pays for them 
its the most basic part of the citys transportation 
system he said adding that the city pays for streets trails 
and parks

a rightwing hindu party withdrew its 
support for prime minister vp singhs government today 
threatening to bring down the fragile coalition that has governed 
india for the past 10 months 
singh refused to resign and said he would take the battle to 
floor of parliament where his centrist national front government 
had relied on the votes of the hindu fundamentalist bharatiya 
janata party to survive 
the crisis was precipitated by the arrest earlier tuesday of 
bharatiya janatas president lal krishna advani as he led a 
crosscountry march to muster support for building a new hindu 
temple on the site of a 16th century moslem mosque 
about six hours later party leaders submitted a letter to 
indian president ramaswamy venkataraman withdrawing support for 
singhs national front government 
the prime minister told reporters at the presidential palace 
that the loss of bharatiya janata support doesnt mean that all 
support is gone however it was unclear how he could avoid 
calling new elections 
with the defection of the bharatiya janata party singhs 
centrist government loses the fragile majority it cobbled together 
from across the political spectrum after november general 
elections 
no single party had won enough seats to take power unilaterally 
the next steps are up to singh and the president 
under the constitution the options include singhs resignation 
as prime minister and elections for a new parliament 
president venkataraman could also ask singh to try to muster a 
new majority in parliament which appears mathematically and 
politically improbable 
or the president can turn to the opposition leader former 
prime minister rajiv gandhi and ask if gandhis congress party 
could form a coalition government 
that also appears unlikely 
the crisis was precipitated by advanis determination to go 
ahead with his march to bolster support for the campaign to replace 
a moslem mosque with a temple to the hindu god lord rama 
singh had urged hindu fundamentalists to postpone the temple 
plan at least 80 people died this month in hindumoslem clashes 
spurred by the dispute 
in a nationally televised address monday night singh renewed 
his appeal and said he was prepared to face the fact that his stand 
could bring down the government 
religious fanaticism is the first step towards the foundation 
for a theocratic state singh said in his 20minute tv speech 
it will be the death of india as a secular state 
the prime minister added hundreds of governments can come and 
go but the nation should remain one 
advani was arrested about sunrise in a remote part of bihar 
state near the village of samastipur about 450 miles southeast of 
new delhi 
he had been leading a caravan of supporters across the hindu 
heartland to demonstrate and bolster support for plans to build a 
temple on a site now occupied by a 16th century mosque in the holy 
hindu town of ayodhya ayodhya is in uttar pradesh state which 
lies between new delhi and bihar state 
advanis planned path through bihar and uttar pradesh en route 
to ayodhya would have taken him through poor villages populated by 
both moslems and hindus in bihar especially these villages have 
been recurring flashpoints for hindumoslem violence 
hindu fundamentalists have vowed to start building the temple in 
one week on the spot where they say the hindu god lord rama was 
born moslem activists and religious leaders have vowed to prevent 
any encroachment on the mosque 
the outcry has torn at the social and political fabric of 
officially secular india where 82 percent of the 880 million 
people are hindus moslems form 12 percent of the population 
singh took office in december after ousting gandhi and his 
congress party in the november general election although the 
congress party and its allies hold 210 of parliaments 522 seats 
it lacked the majority to govern 
singhs national front coalition holds just 141 seats but it 
won the tacit support of the two extremes of indias political 
spectrum advanis rightwing hindu party and the left front 
alliance of several communist parties 
with that support singh could draw on enough votes to give him 
the majority needed to pass legislation and stay in power 
bharatiya janata has 88 members of parliament the left front 
51

scientists set free a rare megamouth 
shark only one of five ever seen after deciding the 15foot 
2000pound behemoth with a gaping silvery maw could not survive 
in captivity 
biologists attached a radio transmitter to the shark monday so 
they can track it for three days until the devices batteries run 
out 
the shark is a fabulous opportunity for us but the animal 
comes first said dennis kelly an orange coast college marine 
biologist you hate to see something like this die 
it was apparently the first member of its species to be brought 
ashore alive and only the fifth such creature ever seen this is 
like an alien coming out of the depths its one in a million 
kelly said 
with its large bulbous snout and mouth that can open as wide as 
two feet the planktoneating megamouth is one of the largest 
sharks in the world its mouth is lined with silvery tissue that 
scientists believe may generate light to attract plankton in dark 
ocean water 
the shark was accidentally snared in a 1200footwide drift net 
sunday in shallow water offshore then towed here by a 38foot 
commercial fishing boat and tethered by its tail to the vessel 
after trying without success to find an aquarium big enough to 
hold the shark scientists decided to release it said robert 
lavenberg curator of fishes at the los angeles county museum of 
natural history 
the fishing boat towed the shark out of the harbor so scientists 
could videotape it underwater and attach the transmitter 
it will show the depth which is the most significant thing we 
can find out said rocky strong a researcher for the cousteau 
society 
scientists wondered why the shark was swimming in less than 100 
feet of water when caught by the net the sharks are known to swim 
at depths of 700 feet to several thousand feet 
the sea shepherd conservation society in redondo beach had urged 
that the shark be released immediately 
its as if we found a dinosaur and chained it to a tree until 
it dies sea shepherd president scott trimingham said one 
animal left alive in the wild is worth more than 1000 dead 
specimens 
the first megamouth shark ever discovered was caught off hawaii 
in 1976 after it swallowed a navy anchor it died before biologists 
could see it 
a megamouth was caught off californias santa catalina island in 
1984 but died en route to port it is on display at lavenbergs 
museum 
another washed ashore south of perth australia and died within 
hours the decomposed carcass of a fourth megamouth washed ashore 
in japan 
all four megamouths seen previously measured about 14 feet

the usbacked drug war in colombia has 
diverted attention from unprecendented human rights abuses 
including those committed by armysponsored death squads a rights 
group says 
the independent group americas watch said monday that 
disappearances massacres and assassinations have soared since the 
government cracked down on the drug trade in august 1989 
americas watch did not accuse the central government of directly 
violating human rights but said it had refused to acknowledge the 
high degree of military involvement only making matters worse 
the report said army troops repeatedly violate the laws of war 
in trying to eradicate leftist guerrillas and have formed 
unholy alliances with drug traffickers and paramilitary death 
squads 
it also documented human rights violations by leftwing rebels 
and traffickers traffickers who have acquired vast land holdings 
often share the fanatical rightwing ideologies of the death 
squads the report said 
it said the bush administration did not escape responsibility 
since it pours in millions of dollars of military aid without 
demanding human rights safeguards 
us antidrug aid often ends up in the hands of unscrupulous 
army officers who use the money to terrorize local populations the 
report says 
the government of president cesar gaviria in office for three 
months is preparing an official response to the report 
a senior government official speaking to reporters on condition 
of anonymity denied that the government lacks the will to 
prosecute army officers who violate human rights 
between 2000 and 2200 members of the armed forces have been 
removed from their posts for various disciplinary reasons since 
1987 he said 
the former administration of president virgilio barco began a 
major crackdown on drug traffickers after the medellin cocaine 
cartel assassinated a leading presidential candidate in august 
1989 
since then the government has blamed most political killings on 
the cartel all but ignoring army involvement americas watch said 
the governments insistence that the medellin cartel leaders 
are responsible for all violent abuses has become a serious 
obstacle to efforts to halt the violence since it has left other 
paramilitary groups largely free to assassinate leftist leaders and 
massacre their perceived supporters the report says 
it says political violence claimed the lives of 4000 people in 
1988 and 3200 in 1989 adding these figures as noted are the 
highest in the hemisphere during those years 
some senior army officers have joined forces with paramilitary 
death squads and drug traffickers in a common battle to defeat the 
left at any cost the study says 
while recognizing the courageous efforts of many officials 
who tried to curb abuses americas watch said government security 
personnel have tortured or murdered some suspected drug 
traffickers 
suspects disappeared after their arrest many detainees were 
tortured and in neighborhoods of medellin the police arrested young 
people indiscriminately and at times opened fire in crowded public 
places the report says 
medellin colombias second largest city is home to the worlds 
most notorious cocaine cartel 
the government official acknowledged that problems of this 
nature could exist but said security forces who commit abuses 
act on their own 
americas watch said the bush administration is expected to send 
382 million in military and police aid to colombia between 1990 
and 1994 without any effort to ensure that these funds do not 
reach abusive forces

the two koreas met on the soccer field 
at olympic stadium today before more than 80000 south koreans who 
cheered for both teams and roared approval for unification 
south koreas national team won 10 but the score was 
insignificant beside the diplomatic coup in having two enemy 
nations share a playing field for only the second time since world 
war ii 
the first time was two weeks ago in north korea when the 
northern team beat the south 21 
todays crowd was the largest to see a south korean sports event 
since the 1988 olympic games 
at the end of the game spectators rose for a standing ovation 
as the athletes jogged around the stadium holding hands and waving 
the teams exchanged shirts and waved them in the air 
our wish is unification blared a unification song over the 
loudspeakers 
the game called northsouth unification soccer is the high 
point of a fiveday visit by a 78member north korean sports 
delegation the first from the communist north to visit the south 
since the 1945 division of the peninsula 
south korean soccer players visited the north earlier this 
month that visit was only the second civilian exchange between the 
countries in more than four decades 
the soccer delegation returns to north korea on friday after 
rounds of sightseeing dinners and talks on future sports 
exchanges 
south korean sports minister chung dong sung and his north 
korean counterpart kim yu sun agreed in principle to form a joint 
single team for the 1992 olympic games and other international 
sports events at talks in pyongyang they said further discussions 
would be held in seoul 
about 5000 plainclothes police were positioned inside and 
outside the stadium spectators were searched twice and passed 
through metal detectors to get to their seats scalpers were asking 
140 for tickets 10 times the highest face value price 
the teams of the rival koreas entered the stadium side by side 
holding hands and waving to thunderous applause 
this is not purely sports festival kim said before the 
match began it should lead to a unification festival 
i hope this soccer match will be a spring board for national 
unification chung 
thousands roared in approval and waved colorful pompons 
spectators had been asked not to bring national flags decorative 
placards or other paraphernalia which would be identified only with 
south korea 
a drum and bugle corps played and a gigantic electric signboard 
flashed the pictures of the ministers the north korean team threw 
half a dozen soccer balls signed with their signatures into the 
grandstand and screaming spectators raced to retrieve them 
during the game the south korean crowd cheered wildly for plays 
by both teams radical students who had said they would root for 
the north korean visitors were not visible 
news reports said tickets were sold on an individual basis 
apparently to avoid large radical or dissident groups sitting 
together 
the sports exchange comes at a time when south korea and north 
korea are seeking to find ways to ease tensions and work together 
for unification 
the prime ministers of both koreas met for the second time last 
week in pyongyang the norths capital and have agreed to meet 
again in seoul in december a south korean musicians delegation 
returns wednesday from a 10day visit to the north 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 at the end of the world war ii the two 
nations fought a war in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was 
never signed 
the border between the koreas remains tightly sealed and is one 
of the most heavily fortified demarcations in the world with more 
than 15 million troops on either side

the doctor who first identified lyme disease 15 
years ago says doctors are overdiagnosing the tickborne illness 
its being used to cause a number of conditions it is not 
causing dr allen steere of the tufts university school of 
medicine said monday 
the bacterial disease which causes a distinctive bullseye 
rash fever and arthritis and is carried by tiny ticks that are 
often found on deer is being blamed for conditions ranging from 
chronic fatigue to stress steere said 
the danger he said at the interscience conference on 
antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy occurs when misdiagnosed 
patients are put on antibiotics for up to two years and run the 
risk of complications from the drugs 
the national centers for disease control reported 7402 cases of 
lyme disease in the united states in 1989 up from 4574 in 1988 
no ones quite sure exactly how many of the reported cases are 
not properly diagnosed or how many actual cases never get reported 
steere said 
but the idea that thousands of cases misdiagnosed as lyme 
disease are occurring each year i think thats in the ballpark 
of what were dealing with he said 
steere was at yale university when he identified the first cases 
of lyme disease in 1975 in patients from old lyme conn

heart transplantation for abbott northwestern hospital and the 
minneapolis heart institute

emery said the hospital and heart institute were investigating 
how the mistake occurred he said a check revealed no other errors 
involving patients on the institutes waiting list

chances of survival would have been close to 100 percent he said 
the survival rate for typeo patients receiving transplants from 
typea donors is about 60 percent 
shortly after the new heart began functioning in the mans 
chest laboratory personnel discovered the mistake 
doctors put out a call for a second matched heart but none 
became available the man had waited about six months for the first 
heart

friday emery said 
the patients own heart was nearly destroyed by cardiomyopathy 
a deterioration of the heart muscle he also suffered from lung 
problems and kidney failure

artificial heart to carry him until a matched heart became

baseball commissioner fay vincent has 
thrown his support behind a plan to move the san francisco giants 
40 miles south to silicon valley 
vincent said monday the santa clara giants had a certain 
ring to it referring to the name that makes skin crawl in san 
francisco the giants home for 33 years 
if you get the vote it will be a bigleague name i guarantee 
it he said 
voters in santa clara county will decide next month whether to 
build a 153 million stadium in santa clara 
vincent said the move was the best solution to the dire 
situation san francisco voters created last fall when they narrowly 
defeated a measure to build a new ballpark to replace aging 
candlestick park 
the alternatives are keeping the giants at candlestick famouse 
for icy wind blasts and fog or moving out of the san francisco bay 
area vincent said 
i dont think there are many communities in the united states 
who get a chance at a team and turn it down san francisco seems to 
be the exception he said 
giants owner bob lurie wants out of candlestick and has cited 
surveys showing that fans dont support the team enough because 
they dont like the ballpark

missouris supreme court threw an 
initiative off the november ballot that if approved would have 
cut the number of state lawmakers created an ethics commission and 
shortened legislative sessions 
the court monday agreed with a lower court that amendment 5 
unconstitutionally dealt with too many subjects 
curtis wilkerson a supporter of the measure charged that 
legislative leaders by sitting up front at the hearing on the 
issue had intimidated the court with unspoken threats of no more 
pay raises if they upheld the measure 
the measure would have reduced the statehouse from 160 
legislators to 103 in 2003 and would have barred lawmakers from 
tacking pay raises for themselves onto other bills the ethics 
commission would have governed lawmakers and other officials 
it would have shortened the legislative session by two weeks 
its a shame the court decided to block the peoples right to 
vote on this issue never before has the will of hundreds of 
thousands of missourians been so plainly disregarded by politicians 
and the courts said gov john ascroft a republican who strongly 
backed the initiative 
the court did not say whether any of the seven judges dissented 
the oneparagraph ruling said a written opinion would be issued 
later

too many people who file lawsuits could have 
talked their differences out and saved money say lawyers and 
business people with a plan to promote more talking and less suing 
ninetyfive percent of cases settle without trial but often 
settlement happens on the eve of trial said colorado bar 
association president jerry conover 
lawyers and business association officials introduced a program 
monday called colorado pledge which they believe is the first of 
its kind participating businesses promise not to sue each other 
until theyve tried to resolve disputes through negotiations or 
other alternatives 
the bar association will supervise the resolution efforts 
we hope it will show to you a side of lawyers that is not 
frequently enough publicized a side of lawyers that solves 
problems and helps clients solve problems not in the courtroom 
arena conover said 
the bar association the greater denver chamber of commerce the 
colorado association of commerce and industry and the national 
federation of independent business are participating 
but absent from mondays news conference announcing colorado 
pledge was a representative of another lawyers group the colorado 
trial lawyers association 
companies that have signed the pledge so far include adolph 
coors co pepsi cola bottling co of colorado springs and united 
banks of colorado inc 
staying out of court will save businesses money and avoiding 
litigation will save their executives time said those putting the 
program together 
art shenkin whose accounting company signed the pledge said he 
once served as an expert witness in a case where the legal fees 
on both sides turned out to be more than the total amount being 
sued for 
had the parties been able to get together for a solution 
amicable to both sides it would have saved a lot of money and a 
lot of time and both businesses would have been better off 
shenkin said

king fahd today urged saddam hussein 
to withdraw from kuwait and said the iraqi president would not lose 
face if he did according to news reports 
the statement appeared to be saudi arabias most conciliatory 
message yet to the iraqi leader since his forces seized kuwait on 
aug 2 and subsequently massed on the saudi border 
it would be nothing to cause anxiety or pain fahd told the 
saudi press agency but to the contrary if president saddam 
thought seriously about the matter he will find that it is in the 
interest of iraq in his interest and in the interest of the arab 
nation that he pull out from kuwait 
if a blunder was committed there is no reason to follow the 
mistake with another mistake the correct reply is to remedy the 
mistake 
the saudi press agency distributed fahds statements hours after 
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak the two also met 
monday to discuss the nearly 3monthold gulf crisis fahd made the 
statements to the reporters accompanying the egyptian leader the 
agency said 
if saddam acted on this advice we would be thankful fahd 
said if he thinks he will get another reaction i think he will 
get thanks 
egypt has 14000 troops deployed in the mostly us 
multinational force of 300000 men and women that was rushed to the 
region to confront saddam 
at the start of his saudi visit monday mubarak met with his 
troops deployed at the northeastern region of hafr albatin and 
told them their presence was meant to force him who lost his 
reason to return to it 
he also expressed egypts hope that the gulf crisis will end 
without bloodshed 
mubarak departed today for the united arab emirates another 
gulf ally of kuwait where egyptian forces are also deployed 
diplomatic sources said monday that fahd and mubarak agreed the 
iraqi withdrawal and the restoration of the alsabah family to the 
rule in kuwait could be followed by negotiations on disputes that 
caused the invasion 
on sunday saudi defense minister prince sultan third in the 
leadership after fahd and crown prince abdullah said rights 
whether valid or doubtful could always be discussed but only 
after a iraqi withdrawal 
some quarters took the princes remarks as a sign that the 
saudis were ready to agree to territorial concessions by kuwait 
this was a factor in oil prices plunging 514 a barrel in new york 
and closing at 2838 
the saudi defense minister subsequently issued a statement to 
clarify wrong interpretations of his words and reaffirmed 
that the kingdom categorically rejects the iraqi aggression on 
sister kuwait 
the statement distributed today by the saudi press agency said 
the kingdom reaffirms its full committment to all arab and 
international resolutions demanding iraq unconditionally 
withdrawfrom kuwait and the restoration of legitimacy to kuwait 
under the leadership of the emir

an arbitrator has upheld a water and sewer 
commission edict that prohibits workers from having lunchtime 
cocktails but says workers accustomed to the practice should be 
given time to adapt 
arbitrator timothy j buckalew agreed with commission director 
robert cioleks noalcohol rule which was imposed last january 
union officials contended workers have the right to do whatever 
they please during their unpaid lunch breaks the union said it 
would accept the ban only if workers got a raise or a shorter work 
day 
in his decision released monday buckalew said the commission 
had the right to impose the ban for safety 
the commission clearly has an interest in insuring not only 
that the employee reports to work sober but that he maintains 
sobriety throughout his work day he wrote 
buckalew added however that workers who do drink at lunch be 
given ample grace time to change their habits 
as a footnote to the decision buckalew quoted from the bible 
go eat your bread with enjoyment and drink your wine with a 
merry heart for god has already approved of what you do 
ciolek said drinking at lunch was dangerous for the workers who 
sometimes must drive and operate jackhammers on the job 
there is no constitutional right to have a few pops at 
lunch ciolek said

chinas guardians of marxist ideology announced a 
new campaign today against pornography and western liberalism and 
said they would press on with an anticrime drive in which hundreds 
have been executed 
the announcements made in headlines in the communist party 
newspaper the peoples daily contradicted widespread expectations 
that the party would relax its tight social controls after the 
asian games ended oct 7 in beijing 
hong kong newspapers many of which have close ties to chinese 
officials had predicted that more participants in last years 
failed democracy movement would be released from jail if the games 
went off smoothly 
but zhou chengkui spokesman for the national peoples congress 
said on monday he had no word of forthcoming releases 
todays announcements further indicated the hardliners who have 
dominated chinese politics since june 1989 have no intention of 
relaxing their hold their speeches said that chinas current 
stability is fragile and called for vigilence against alleged 
antiparty forces 
at present our country is politically economically and 
socially stable qiao shi the party official in charge of police 
matters said in giving the order to continue chinas 6monthold 
crackdown on crime 
but we must see clearly that the relatively smooth public 
order of these few months was achieved through the might of the 
crackdown on crime he said in ideology and in work we 
cannot relax one whit 
the international human rights group amnesty international said 
last month that more than 720 people were given death sentences in 
china from january through midaugust including more than 350 in 
june and july alone 
official newspapers have reported thousands of arrests since the 
anticrime campaign began in may causing cities to expand their 
police forces and in some cases form civilian patrols 
the party also held an antipornography campaign for about six 
months beginning in june 1989 when the army crushed a studentled 
movement for democratic reforms not only pornographic but 
prodemocratic publications were seized and burned 
liu zhongde who headed that drive said a new campaign to last 
through next spring will clean up remaining spiritual pollution 
and cultural garbage 
the peoples daily quoted him as saying that 12 percent of the 
countrys newspapers 13 percent of its social science periodicals 
and more than 7 percent of its publishing houses had been closed 
since june 1989 
he said 32 million books and magazines were destroyed and nearly 
80000 people were convicted for involvement in illegal publising 
activity 
this is still just a good beginning he said some obscene 
publications that have been explicitly banned have reappeared in 
new form illegal publishing activities have reared their heads 
he blamed this on the bourgeois liberal tide the partys 
phrase for westernstyle democratic ideas such as free speech and 
multiparty rule 
people who support bourgeois liberalism advocate complete 
westernization he said but complete westernization 
necessarily opens the door to corrupt and degenerate capitalist 
things and thus obscene things are spread

james tucker was just dozing off 
after a hard night of marine guard duty in beirut seven years ago 
when a bomb blast demolished a nearby barracks and jolted him from 
bed 
the oct 23 1983 truck bombing killed 241 americans mostly 
marines 
tucker now 26 years old and a sergeant is dug into another 
defensive position in saudi arabia today but his marine outfit is 
far more cautious 
were more terroristoriented we are more terroristaware 
said capt john gauthier 30 of caldwell nj a company 
commander with the 1st battalion 6th marine regiment 
in the aftermath of the truck bombing by a shiite moslem suicide 
driver opposed to the us involvement in lebanon the marines 
changed everything about the way they defend themselves 
since deploying in saudi arabia in the wake of iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait these marines have had at least four heightened 
security alerts for terrorist attacks 
most of these marines were in high school at the time of the 
beirut bombing and have little memory of it but the threat is 
emphasized in their training and even the smallest incident can 
provoke a response 
a civilian car flashing its lights near a camp was sufficient to 
trigger one alert 
the threat has also been used to try to cover at least one 
embarrassing incident when a soldier with a selfinflicted wound 
first claimed he was shot during a gunfight with terrorists 
marine officers and enlisted men say the main lessons drawn from 
beirut are that they cannot let their guard down and the united 
states has to stick to clearcut policy goals 
the approximately 900 marines sent into beirut as a peacekeeping 
force in the aftermath of the israeli invasion were gradually 
pulled into a sniping war with the shiite militias in the 
neighborhoods around their main airport barracks 
but they simultaneously maintained the peacekeeping policy of 
leaving ammunition clips out of their guns while on regular duty 
were all walking around with loaded weapons right now and if 
the need comes to use them we wont hesitate said sgt richard 
hall 27 of jacksonville nc 
security precautions include not billeting marines in large 
buildings not entering civilian stores watching out for any 
speeding vehicles on nearby roads and only stopping on highways for 
police or other military vehicles 
the marines in beirut were too lax their defenses were 
down said lance cpl peter delgado 27 of buffalo ny 
soldiers out in the desert are keeping their weapons close by 
whether in the chow line showers or on morning exercises 
it helps you keep your guard up delgado added 
the marines feel confident that their scattered desert positions 
have lessened the threat to a great extent 
i dont think a truck loaded with dynamite could make it out 
here we have enough trouble with our own trucks said lt david 
gurfein 25 a mortar platoon leader from great neck ny 
having iraq as a clearly defined enemy and the saudi commitment 
to their involvement also gives confidence 
here you see all arab countries pulling together to get one 
person ousted from kuwait gauthier said 
but the fact that they are dug into defensive positions causes 
some concern 
im not real happy with static positions gauthier said 
id rather be moving 
the actual anniversary of the marine barracks explosion did not 
prompt a security alert saudi officials and diplomats said 
but for beirut veterans like sgt tucker the anniversary brings 
to mind the huge black cloud he saw over the barracks from his 
billet at a nearby university the day of the attack 
it makes me feel a little light in the stomach he said 
thinking about the friends he lost

increasing pressure from his party to quit the race 
an internal gop poll last week indicated that five republicans 
including carlson could beat perpich in the nov 6 election but 
that grunseth could not carlson auditor since 1979 finished 
second to grunseth in last months gop primary 
grunseth welcomed carlsons decision to get back in the race 
saying carlson is liberal enough to pull democratic votes from 
perpich 
grunseth also said he would stay in the race the road to 
victory over rudy perpich has been paved with my reputation and the 
tears of my family and ive got a right to drive down that road 
he said 
perpich seeking a fourth term said of the development this 
has to be solved by the republicans themselves 
republicans began the year with high hopes of unseating perpich 
who had been derided as eccentric and put on the defensive about 
living in too grand a style with a luxury car and bodyguard 
carlson acknowledged that a runin campaign has a very slim 
chance of success 
but he told supporters im convinced that regardless of how 
difficult the mechanical barriers of a writein campaign may be i 
think with your help all throughout the state of minnesota we can 
do something that is unprecedented we can win 
according to the sworn statements by the two women grunseth 
urged them his 13yearold daughter and a 16yearold girl to swim 
naked with him at a 1981 party at his house the women said they 
refused but that grunseth his daughter nina and the 16yearold 
took off their clothes 
one of the women said grunseth also tried to pull down the strap 
of her bathing suit and touch her breast 
grunseths daughter denied the allegations and grunseth said 
that if any skinnydipping occurred it was after he went to bed 
have i ever been skinnydipping in my life he said sunday 
yeah so what 
carlsons action kind of took the wind out of a move by some 
lawmakers to pressure grunseth to resign senate gop minority 
leader duane benson said 
a lot of people are kind of comfortable with two republican 
people in it benson said but it would have really boiled had 
arne waited another day 
house republican leader bill schreiber said the carlson 
candidacy could boost gop turnout and help the party capture more 
seats in the legislature democrats control both houses but all 
201 seats are up for reelection 
john stanoch perpichs campaign chairman said grunseths 
popularity and support have been declining over the past week i 
would suppose the majority of that support is going to go to arne 
carlson he said

president bush campaigning for 
republican candidates in new england today defended his support 
for unpopular higher taxes and spending cuts he said the days of 
damn the deficit must come to an end 
were hanging tough for a good agreement bush said 
speaking in one of the most economically hardpressed regions of 
the country he said he hoped a budget package he can support would 
be crafted by congressional negotiators by wednesdays midnight 
deadline 
weve got a sluggish economy out there nationally bush 
said claiming that a 500billion fiveyear deficitreduction 
plan could help the economy by driving down interest rates 
he called on republicans many of whom oppose his budget stand 
to put self interest aside and stand with him in support of a 
budget plan 
the days of tax and spend and damn the deficit must come to an 
end bush said at the vermont fundraising breakfast 
he was introduced by rep peter smith rvt who is running for 
reelection and who is one of the few republicans in the house to 
have voiced support for a democraticdrafted deficitcutting plan 
opposed by the administration 
for his part smith said my differences with the 
administration are a matter of record he noted his support for 
the civil rights bill bush vetoed on monday as well as their 
differences on the budget 
however he praised bushs support for a package combining tax 
increases with spending cuts and said vermont voters were willing 
to pay higher taxes to get the nation out of deficit spending 
smith originally supported the taxincrease and spendingcut 
plan assembled by the white house and congressional leaders but 
later repudiated by the house when the original bill failed smith 
announced support for a democraticdesigned bill which boosted the 
tax rate on the highestincome earners and added a surtax for 
millionaires that bill was condemned by the white house 
i wish hed stop reminding me that we have a few differences 
out there bush said praising smith for having an independent 
mind 
smiths reelection bid is being challenged by former burlington 
mayor bernie sanders a socialist 
bush claimed democratic control of both houses of congress was 
to blame for the current budget mess 
bush traveled through new england on a small twoengine jet the 
runways at some of his stops were too small to accommodate the 
large jumbo jet that he usually uses as air force one 
outside bushs first stop several dozen protesters stood in the 
rain carrying banners and shouted at bushs motorcade urging him 
not to go to war over oil in the persian gulf 
i saw some of those signs saying no war for oil bush noted 
he said he could understand the frustrations of the demonstrators 
but bush said the starving of embassies the holding of 
hostages and the occupation by iraq of kuwait were crimes against 
humanity 
there can never be any compromise against this type of 
aggression bush said 
he compared saddam husseins invasion of kuwait to hitlers 
occupation of poland 
it isnt oil were concerned about its aggression and this 
aggression is not going to stand he declared to a sustained 
round of applause 
new englands economy after being the strongest during the 
reagan years is now one of the nations weakest

congressional negotiators struggled today to 
resolve their differences over how to raise taxes on the wealthy 
president bush appealed to republicans to put aside their 
selfinterest and line up behind the deficitcutting plan 
taking shape 
after months of effort lawmakers appeared to be building toward 
agreement on a plan that would raise the gasoline tax tax the 
wealthy and cut programs as diverse as medicare and farm subsidies 
asked if agreement were near house democratic whip bill gray 
said who knows lightning might strike at any moment 
bushs top aides were involved in the talks while the president 
campaigned in new england both for gop congressional candidates 
and for the deficitcutting deal 
bush called on house republicans many of whom opposed his 
budget stand to put selfinterest aside and stand with him in 
support of a plan were hanging tough for a good agreement 
bush said at a burlington vt fundraiser for republican rep 
peter smith 
at the capitol house democratic leaders met with their rank and 
file to discuss the proposals to raise taxes on the richest 
americans we want to talk to them about how to bring the wealthy 
in what the administration says it wants to do gray said 
a dispute over how to raise taxes on americans with incomes over 
100000 a year is blocking agreement on the 250 billion 
deficitreduction plan 
after a full day of onandoff talks house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash said monday night that bargainers were on the brink 
of agreement 
not yet senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
replied when asked whether a tentative agreement had been reached 
time is short the government will run out of money at midnight 
wednesday and there are doubts president bush will sign a third 
stopgap spending bill unless a deficit agreement is ready in 
addition congress is eager to adjourn this week for the year 
by all accounts the biggest obstacle to signing a pact was 
choosing between democrats insistence on a surtax on highincome 
taxpayers and a republican proposal to limit their itemized 
deductions 
whatever option is chosen would be added to a plan that 
tentatively would raise the top tax rate on the nations wealthiest 
from the current 28 percent to 31 percent that would represent a 
major concession for bush 
part of the money drawn from the wealthy would be used to scale 
down the 9centagallon gasoline tax increase passed by the 
senate and to moderate proposed increases in medicare patient 
costs 
the deficit bill would raise taxes on tobacco alcoholic 
beverages and airplane tickets and levy a new luxury tax on part of 
the price of expensive cars boats planes furs and jewels the 
measure would considerably reduce medicare reimbursement of 
physicians and hospitals 
people whose wages exceed 51300 a year would pay a higher tax 
for medicare farm subsidies would be reduced some fees for 
federal services would go up the tax and medicare package would 
when added to spending restraints on most government programs and 
reduced interest payments reduce the budget deficit by about 500 
billion over the next five years 
both the senate bill and the house version would require 
upperincome people to pay a heavy share of the tax increase 
the administration is adamantly opposed to the surtax saying it 
would amount to another taxrate increase on those with higher 
incomes bushs negotiators and senate republicans say a limitation 
on deductions would be much fairer 
house democratic leader richard gephardt of missouri said after 
the session monday night that the surtax was still on the table 
others involved in the discussions including sen bob packwood of 
oregon senior republican on the finance committee said that 
option was all but dead 
the democrats surtax would require the 35000 people with 
taxable incomes after deductions and exemptions above 1 
million a year to pay an additional levy of as much as 10 percent 
a person who pays 300000 in tax for example would have to pay 
an extra 30000 
the republican substitute would limit itemized deductions 
available to the 22 million couples and individuals with adjusted 
gross incomes over 100000 one version would permit a person to 
write off only 95 percent of otherwise allowable deductions against 
that portion of income over 100000 
thus a person would give up 500 of deductions for each 10000 
that his or her income exceeds 100000 the limit would not apply 
to deductions for medical expenses investment interest or casualty 
or theft losses 
democrats from populous states especially california and new 
york have criticized the limitation on the ground it discriminates 
against states with high taxes 
the house ways and means committee staff in an explanation 
prepared for the democratic caucus said the limitation is based 
solely on the taxpayers income not deductions and thus would 
not place an unfair burden on residents of any state 
nevertheless the proposal is being fought by organized 
charities and the housing industry on the assumption that limiting 
deductions would cut incentives for giving and home buying

the nov 6 election for cook county offices is in 
limbo while the us supreme court decides whether to allow 
candidates from the harold washington party to run 
we aint running this election anymore cook county clerk 
stanley kusper said at a news conference monday the supreme 
court of the united states is running it and all we can do is wait 
until they tell us what to do 
with just two weeks until the election justice john paul 
stevens on monday halted further printing and distribution of 
ballots saying the full court should hear a dispute over 
candidates from the thirdparty named for chicagos first black 
mayor 
justices may take up the issue friday 
the ballots were being printed without the names of 19 
candidates on the washington party representing some blacks 
disenchanted with the democratic party the county includes chicago 
and some suburban areas 
the illinois supreme court voted 43 on oct 12 that the party 
was not entitled to appear on the ballot because of insufficient 
nominating petitions the court majority was made up of democratic 
justices 
stevens stayed that illinois supreme court order and allowed 
election preparations to proceed but ballots already had been 
printed without the washington party slate 
our people tell us if they have to start from scratch doing 
the ballot it would be impossible to hold the election on nov 6 
said tom leach a spokesman for the chicago board of elections 
election officials from the city and suburban cook county said 
they stopped further ballot printing and delivery of voting 
equipment and suspended absentee voting which officially began 
monday 
jim hutchinson the partys vice chairman said members wont 
commen on stevens order because they havent discussed it with 
their lawyers 
we dont know what all this means and we dont want to offend 
the court by saying anything hutchinson said 
the legal action challenging the candidates was begun by five 
petitioners who washington party officials contend were acting for 
the county democratic party george leighton the attorney for that 
group said he would seek to have stevens stay overturned 
harold washington the citys first black mayor died nov 25 
1987 after suffering a heart attack

in a conciliatory move aimed 
at ending black factional fighting the african national congress 
has proposed a meeting between nelson mandela and rival black 
leader mangosuthu buthelezi 
in its statement monday the anc backed down from months of 
resistance to a mandelabuthelezi meeting it did not say when the 
two should meet only that such a meeting should take place in the 
near future 
zulus loyal to buthelezis conservative inkatha freedom party 
have been involved in bloody battles with anc supporters since the 
mid1980s 
buthelezi said he welcomed the invitation for a meeting which 
he said inkatha had been pursuing for some time now 
mandela who is visiting australia said today he hoped the 
meeting would ease tensions violence between anc and inkatha in 
black townships around johannesburg has claimed about 800 lives 
since early august 
future meetings are important mandela told a news 
conference in canberra you create a new atmosphere an 
atmosphere of hope the meeting raises the hope of a peaceful 
resolution 
mandela said he had presented evidence of government complicity 
in the violence to the australian cabinet that included affidavits 
from witnesses but such evidence has not been shown to his 
government because people who have spoken out in the past have 
been harassed he said 
later mandela became angry when australian radio attempted to 
set up a surprise live telephone conversation between him and 
buthelezi mandela was sitting in the studio after finishing a 
radio interview when buthelezi was introduced via a telephone 
hookup 
in fairness you should have told me mandela said before 
returning to his hotel he did not speak to buthelezi 
if a meeting takes place it would be the first between mandela 
and buthelezi since mandelas release in february from 27 years in 
prison 
the two were scheduled to meet earlier this year but mandela 
canceled under pressure from the anc which felt the talks would 
enhance buthelezis stature 
the anc later proposed that buthelezi attend a meeting with 
other black homeland leaders but buthelezi turned down the 
invitation because he wanted to attend as the inkatha leader rather 
than in his capacity as head of the kwazulu homeland 
the anc opposes the homeland system saying it is part of the 
apartheid system but inkatha sees the homeland system as an 
interim step to black rule in south africa 
both groups oppose apartheid but inkatha disagrees with anc 
support of boycotts strikes and other protests to fight it 
inkatha has also accssed the anc of trying to speak for all blacks 
in south africa 
under apartheid the black majority has no voice in national 
affairs 
inkatha and the anc have held periodic talks but mandela and 
buthelezi have not attended and each side has blamed the other for 
the surge in factional fighting 
until august the violence had been limited mainly to natal 
province where about 5000 blacks have died since 1986 
the anc had accused buthelezi of orchestrating the latest 
violence to force a meeting with mandela and enhance his stature 
almost all inkatha supporters are zulus while the anc draws 
support across tribal lines

a former kgb general accused the spy agency of 
legal gangsterism today as he battled in court to regain his 
rank and pension which were stripped after he publicly criticized 
the kgb 
oleg kalugin whose 32year career with the kgb included 12 
years as an agent in the united states is suing kgb chairman 
vladimir kryuchkov in a landmark case for soviet citizens aggrieved 
by government actions 
kalugins fight has made him a popular hero and helped him win a 
seat in the national legislature 
the threejudge panel in moscow city court repeatedl had to 
call for order as spectators applauded kalugins lawyer and heckled 
a kgb attorney 
oh my weve hurt the kgbs feelings isnt that too bad an 
elderly woman called out sarcastically after the kgb lawyer victor 
i alexeyev complained about the crowd 
kalugins suit contends that kryuchkov issued secret orders 
depriving him of his rank and pension in retaliation for his 
comments in june in those remarks kalugin said the kgb was 
resisting democratic reforms and continuing to spy on trade unions 
clergymen and other possible opponents of the communist party 
after listening to his arguments today the judges adjourned the 
case until nov 11 they said they were waiting for answers to 
questions sent last month to the council of ministers or national 
cabinet and military prosecutors office 
the court had asked the council of ministers to provide 
documents about how when and why the decision was made to strip 
kalugin of his rank which led to loss of his pension 
the military prosecutor was asked to describe the status of a 
possible criminal lawsuit against kalugin soviet newspapers have 
said the prosecutor was investigating kalugin on a potential charge 
of revealing state secrets 
the 55yearold kalugin has said he once headed the kgbs 
section on foreign counterintelligence he has denied revealing any 
national secrets 
i think kryuchkovs actions represent not only arbitrary rule 
against me personally but also a form of legal gangsterism and i 
cant call it anything else kalugin told the court 
the kgb attorney and the head of the agencys financial planning 
office said at the hearing the decision to deprive kalugin of his 
rank was made by the council of ministers and the loss of his 
pension followed automatically 
kalugins attorney boris a kuznetsov argued that the 
13member council of ministers never met to consider kalugins 
case he said the order was signed by prime minister nikolai i 
ryzhkov at the behest of kryuchkov 
he said documents later were fabricated to make it look as 
though the full council had approved the decision 
kalugin has filed a related separate suit against ryzhkov

a company that supplies animals for 
scientific research today denied an abc news report that it 
inhumanely kills cats 
abc reported monday that carolina biological supply co falsely 
tells customers it acquires only dead cats from animal shelters 
the network said the company actually operates gas chambers in 
which it kills nearly 200 cats a week 
the network aired videotape shot by people for the ethical 
treatment of animals that showed cats being pushed into a gas 
chamber the report quoted an employee whose identity was disguised 
as saying that some cats survive the gas only to be drowned or to 
die on an embalming table 
the allegations made last night on abcs world news tonight 
against carolina biological supply company are unfair distortions 
of the companys practices in dealing with animal specimens which 
have been taken out of context to suggest cruel treatment of 
animals company spokesman ron field said 
field said the company in the past allowed licensed animal 
dealers to use its euthanasia chamber to kill cats it then bought 
but the us department of agriculture told the company it would 
have to change its procedures 
carolina biological supply no longer allows live animals on its 
property he said 
the company is one of the worlds largest suppliers of animals 
for scientific research

in the recommendations the board stated that nasa must 
implement changes to its t38 flight program to reduce the 
potential for human error nasa should also recognize and correct 
factors that contribute to the cause of such errors before other 
dangerous situations are created 
the board recommended that nasa astronauts fly with an 
additional crew member aboard the jets when landing or taking off 
in busy airport areas the board also recommended that nasa 
instruct its pilots to write down instructions given by civilian 
flight controllers 
and the board recommended that the equipment on board the jets 
be modernized to include more safety features

gov ray mabus has ordered the mississippi 
national guard to convene a courtmartial of its top officer for 
buying land in the path of a training area expansion 
the military trial the first against a mississippi national 
guard officer will decide if adjutant general arthur farmer should 
be disciplined for his participation in the august 1989 purchase of 
5 acres of land near camp shelby 
the governors office contends farmer got inside information on 
expansion plans fo the large national guard training facility and 
purchased the land in order to make a profit 
the land deal was an apparent conflict of interest which 
should have been avoided a military investigator concluded in a 
justreleased report 
in a telephone interview monday from his home in crystal 
springs farmer said a hearing could take place as early as this 
weekend 
i think i will be cleared if i get a fair trial once they 
see all the evidence he said its some more harassment im 
not going to quit the more they push me in the corner the more 
im going to buck up 
mabus stripped farmer of daytoday control of the national 
guard in february after reports surfaced that farmer and two 
partners purchased the land next to the base south of hattiesburg 
the purchase came eight months after the military proposed to 
expand camp shelby into the desoto national forest 
in his 15page report military investigator and gulfport lawyer 
wade baine said farmer took great pains to show that he resold 
the property to the other copurchasers at a loss the loss was 
1 
the investigators report based on three summertime hearings 
noted the individuals named by farmer as the copurchasers were 
subordinates of the adjutant general farmers partners were 
not identified in the report 
farmer who continues to draw his 50400 annual salary said he 
was served the courtmartial document monday 
the governor sets the judge jury and the rules to play by 
farmer said my attorney will go down to camp shelby to meet 
with the judge prosecutor and others to see what rules we are 
going to play by 
farmer 57 said the allegations against him are not covered by 
specific penalties in the mississippi code of military justice and 
i have no idea what they are looking at a fine or whatever 
i am still the adjutant general and i can be removed only by 
the senate really the proper way to have done it is to bring me 
before the senate on the charges and i dont think he mabus had 
anything that would stand up there

mayor david dinkins has slashed salaries for the 
top brass at city hall by 5 percent because of the citys fiscal 
crisis and is calling on other elected officials and agency heads 
to follow suit 
the top officials also will no longer be able to count on 
automatic annual raises beginning july 1 manageriallevel raises 
will be tied to individual performance rather than the rate of 
inflation or increases granted to city unions 
its further evidence of the dire fiscal circumstances in 
which we find ourselves dinkins said monday in announcing the 
pay cut for himself and nearly 700 other bureaucrats he is paid 
130000 a year and is taking a 6500 pay cut 
dinkins expects to save more than 4 million through the cuts 
and by freezing salaries for 4000 other managerial employees the 
reductions and freeze will remain in effect at least until june 30 
the end of the current fiscal year 
falling revenues mostly lower tax collections blamed on 
economic recession created a 18 billion gap in the current 
fiscal year which started july 1990 the current budget is 28 
billion a 14 billion gap looms in the next fiscal year 
city council speaker peter vallone and council president andrew 
stein said they also will take 5 percent pay cuts vallone makes 
90000 annually and stein makes 105000 
in this time of fiscal constraint it is important that all 
new yorkers are willing to accept some sacrifice and to pull 
together for the good of the city vallone said 
city employees covered by union contracts will not be affected 
dinkins said he also was asking the citys district attorneys 
borough presidents special narcotics prosecutor and mayoral 
appointees on various boards to impose similar reductions on 
themselves 
dinkins reduction would apply to 44 senior level managers in 
city hall including the five deputy mayors the corporation 
counsel his press secretary and all other mayoral managerial 
employees earning at least 70000 the cuts also would apply to 60 
commissioners 140 deputy commissioners and 202 assistant 
commissioners

american telephone amp telegraph is raising its 
basic night and weekend longdistance telephone rates by 22 
percent effective nov 2 
the company said monday that overall its outofstate 
directdialed longdistance rates have gone down about 42 percent 
since the breakup of the bell system in 1984 
an official of the consumer federation of america however said 
today that while daytime rates used heavily by businesses have gone 
down the night and weekend rates used more often by householders 
have increased 
something is wrong this is not supposed to happen said 
gene kimmelman legislative director and telephone analyst for the 
federation it may be just a couple percent but it shows that the 
policy is messed up 
kimmelman said the consumer group may petition the federal 
communications commission for review of its relaxed regulatory 
procedures adopted 15 months ago under which approval of the 
increase is expected 
the company said the increase will result in about 394 million 
in increased annual revenue about five cents on an average 16 
monthly longdistance bill 
atampt said the increase applies only to outofstate 
directdialed long distance calls made during night and weekend 
hours 
these are after 11 pm sunday through friday and all weekend 
until 5 pm sunday 
this indicates i think that the long distance market is not 
uniformly competitive at least in this area and atampt thinks it 
can raise prices without losing business kimmelman said 
obviously they also think this isnt the most profitable business 
to have or they wouldnt take a risk of raising prices 
rather than seeing everybody benefit from relaxed regulation 
the consumers are going to be paying the price kimmelman said

federal regulators are seeking 308 million 
in restitution from the former chairman of the failed centrust bank 
of miami but a lawyer says the executive doesnt have the money 
and will fight the governments action 
officials of the office of thrift supervision on monday accused 
david l paul of insatiable vanity and greed contributing to 
the collapse of centrust once the biggest savings and loan 
institution in the southeast the failure will cost taxpayers an 
estimated 17 billion 
paul will vigorously contest the regulators demand for 
restitution his attorney aubrey harwell said in a telephone 
interview 
i would find it hard to believe that paul would be able to 
put up the money harwell said he said he hadnt yet seen the 
governments order against paul 
the attorney said paul is in israel but he is not there to evade 
regulatory action and is expected to return soon 
he will be back and we will respond on his behalf harwell 
said 
earlier at a news conference the ots officials said they would 
go to a federal court in miami to compel paul to pay the money if 
he refused to do so by nov 1 
paul used centrust depositors funds for such excesses as 29 
million in paintings a yacht costing 233000 24karat gold leaf 
ceilings and goldplated bathroom plumbing the officials said 
many of the assets were later sold at significant losses by the 
government which took over centrust last february 
the ots officials said the 308 million sought from paul ranks 
second only to the governments 40 million case against charles h 
keating jr the former owner of the failed lincoln savings and 
loan association of irvine calif 
like keating paul was a heavy contributor to political 
candidates he contributed to the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee while sen john kerry dmass was its chairman 
the contributions have become a key issue in the election race 
between kerry and his republican challenger jim rappaport a 
spokesman for kerry michael meehan said today that kerrys 
campaign has not received any money from paul directly 
initiation of this case represents another milestone in this 
agencys efforts to bring to justice those believed to have 
contributed directly through fraud to the failure of sampls in this 
country said ots director timothy ryan the days of high 
living at taxpayer expense have ended 
ryan and other ots officials said their order also bars paul 
from selling or transferring any assets of more than 5000 in 
addition paul is required to submit within five days a statement 
identifying all his assets outside the united states and detailing 
his net worth 
evidence exists that paul diverted millions of dollars of 
centrust funds offshore and that he personally engaged in 
securities and commodities trading overseas the ots said 
the agency which is part of the treasury department also is 
seeking an order that would prohibit paul from working for any 
savings and loan 
among the items regulators are seeking in restitution 
15 million from a fund set up by centrust to pay legal fees in 
lawsuits filed against paul and other directors 
49 million diverted to a special retirement plan created 
mainly for paul the assets of the plan were transferred out of the 
country and managed by edward dg davies a british financier and 
former centrust director who also is named in the ots order 
515000 in premiums paid by centrust on pauls 6 million life 
insurance policies the beneficiary was pauls wife rather than 
centrust the beneficiary authorized by centrusts board of 
directors 
456900 paid by centrust for a security system and guards at 
pauls home from january 1987 through february 1990 
a bonus and salary increase of 393000 paid to paul in october 
1989 following a fiscal year when centrust had a 119 million net 
loss and had been ordered by regulators to stop paying dividends to 
shareholders 
design consulting services costing 300000 and diverted to 
paul for the design of his home and 233000 yacht the 
bodacious the government lost 100000 when it later sold the 
yacht

humphrey the wandering humpback whale is 
back this time stuck in shallows about 200 feet from shore where 
rescuers tossed water to keep his skin moist and waited for high 
tide today to free him 
the 40foot whale who captured the hearts of millions in 1985 
when he spent 25 days lost in the bay and sacramento delta before 
swimming back to the pacific beached himself monday scientists 
recognized him from his tail markings 
the whale was still stranded near a rock this morning after 
rescuers tried for three hours to free him 
volunteers used 12foot boards and a rope to try to get the 
whale back into the water they even used a boat to try to tow him 
back into chilly san francisco bay all to no avail 
amid whipping wind volunteers from the marine mammal center 
worked to keep the wrongway whale safe 
hes immobilized said marc webber the centers science 
administrator were using pumps buckets and towels to keep him 
wet his body heats up when its out of the water and theres his 
great weight the great mass could crush his bones and organs 
denize springer a center spokeswoman said as the tide starting 
rising early today he still seems to be in very good shape he 
made it through the worst time of the night real well 
but a problem faced by volunteers was that humphrey was not 
going along with rescue efforts 
the fact is the animal didnt help us at all hes not 
budging springer said 
volunteers plan to mount another rescue effort this time 
possibly using a crane at high tide this afternoon she said 
humphreys troubles began monday morning when he blundered onto 
mud flats near candlestick park traffic on a highway nearby was 
snarled for hours as commuters stopped to gawk humphrey finally 
floated off at high tide only to get stuck again close to a nearby 
rock 
peigin barrett another mammal center spokeswoman said it 
didnt appear that humphrey was injured by the rocks she said 
illness might have led the whale to beach himself 
those keeping watch overnight included sharnel jackson 14 who 
recalled the whales visit in october 1985 
we had a big banner in class with humphreys name on it she 
said as she lifted the collar of her jacket against the cold i 
know humphrey i want to see him get free 
i thought the chance of seeing him again in the bay would be 
real slim said kenneth belcomb of the center for whale research 
in washington belcomb who was on the scene monday has followed 
humphreys exploits since 1985 
scientists speculated that the whale made a wrong turn that year 
on his annual migration through the bay 
rescuers used everything from underwater explosives to recorded 
whale sounds to try to get humphrey to turn around spending about 
50000 in state and federal money 
during that visit humphrey was watched by legions of joyful 
fans the whale became the subject of songs poems books and of 
course a tshirt 
since then humphrey has been spotted in the ocean near san 
francisco every august or september

government leaders said today that a 
deep pessimism has taken hold in hungary because of economic 
problems that have overshadowed the democratic reforms the nation 
has implemented 
the leaders spoke at a ceremonial meeting of parliament 
commemorating the 34th anniverary of hungarys 1956 revolution the 
bloodiest in the soviet bloc 
speakers at the session drew parallels between the mood of 
apathy now and after the uprising was crushed by soviet tanks 
we are fighting against a lack of selfconfidence said 
parliament speaker gyoergy szabad 
today when the country is living through difficult hours 
when hungary is not only suffering from its legacy but new pains 
and disappointments let us remember 1956 prime minister 
jozsef antall told the assembly 
he called on all parties to fight poverty and keep the germ of 
apathy from contaminating our people 
the revolt was the most violent of several uprisings across 
eastern europe during the four decades of soviet domination 
on oct 23 1956 mass student demonstrations calling for 
greater democracy a multiparrawal of soviet 
troops quickly escalated into armed clashes with hungarian secret 
police and soviet troops 
the revolt ended 12 days later after soviet tanks rumbled into 
the hungarian capital and suppressed the resistance 
official figures put the dead at 5000 to 6000 with 12000 
wounded western estimates said up to 32000 people died and 
200000 fled the country 
this spring hungarian voters realized the dreams of the 
revolutionaries of 1956 and elected a free government that was 
directed to replace hungarys sovietstyle command economy with a 
freemarket system 
last year their spirits lifted with the prospects of 
approaching democracy more than 100000 people held an emotional 
torchlight rally to mark the uprising 
but the optimism that marked that rally appeared to be absent 
this year 
burdened by a debt of more than 20 billion the highest per 
capita in the former soviet bloc hungarians see their economy in 
disarray 
inadequate social services mounting unemployment a daunting 
housing crisis and an infrastructure at least 20 years behind that 
in western societies have added to the gloom 
pessimism prevails despite the fulfillment in the last two years 
of most demands voiced by the 1956 demonstrators they include 
the withdrawal of all soviet troops which is scheduled for 
completion by june 1991 
free elections held in march and april 
the right to strike granted two years ago by reform communists 
who engineered the nations peaceful transformation into a 
democracy 
freedom of expression and of the media which is now 
guaranteed 
economic reform which presently is taking place 
a thorough review of ties with moscow relations with the 
soviet union have been redefined on the basis of equality 
those attending the parliamentary session included vytautas 
landsbergis president of the independentminded soviet republic of 
lithuania he was invited to hungary by the federation of hungarian 
political prisoners 
his presence in the legislature was an indirect reminder of the 
value budapest places on maintaining some distance to moscow 
i work as an accountant and i can tell you that my firms 
situation is shaky indeed almost hopeless karoly petrovics 
told a reporter 
i just dont know how i am going to keep the family going next 
year said petrovics a 27yearold father of two 
relatively few people attended wreathlaying ceremonies to 
fallen revolutionaries at several different venues in a further 
indication of the general mood of resignation

two limestone pits collapsed and buried 10 
peasants who were sent inside to retrieve tools and officials held 
out little hope tuesday for their survival after a week 
underground 
the nanfang daily newspaper in the southeastern city of canton 
said the 195footdeep pits collapsed oct 16 it said rescuers 
were unable to help the buried peasants because the collapse 
triggered a landslide from a nearby hill that was continuing to 
pile dirt on the site a week later 
the newspaper contacted by telephone said the pits had been 
shut down because the owner liu yumin was operating without a 
license however when he detected that the walls were about to 
collapse he hired 10 local peasants to go in and remove the mining 
tools 
most mines in china are stateowned and operated some local 
governments have tolerated private mining but such operations often 
are relatively primitive 
thousands of chinese are killed in accidents at state and 
private mines each year

confusion over the wording of last years 
thrift industry bailout plan has resulted in a small flood of 
lawsuits into a single federal court in washington 
the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act 
mandated that any lawsuit involving a financially troubled savings 
and loan firm must be handled in federal court 
one paragraph of the law said federal courts plural have 
jurisdiction over those lawsuits but two paragraphs later another 
provision says the resolution trust corp which handles the 
thrifts must move the lawsuits to us district court for the 
district of columbia 
michael tucci the rtc senior counsel said a halfdozen federal 
judges across the country have interpreted the law to say that any 
time the agency wants to move a case into federal court it has to 
go to washington 
so far 72 lawsuits have been transferred but there are 
thousands of suits nationwide involving defunct thrifts 
tucci said the number of cases in the court now is pretty 
small considering whats coming 
the additional cases could have a significant impact on the 
civil court docket because judges said they already are busy 
handling a dramatic increase in criminal cases arising from the 
districts drug problems 
id be a fool to think judges and litigants are happy he 
said but weve been given a law to work with and we work with 
it the best way we can 
barbara timmer general counsel for the house banking committee 
who helped draft the law said she was surprised the paragraphs 
were an issue the clauses were intended to give rtc lawyers a 
choice of which federal court to move a case to not to limit them 
to federal court in washington she said 
us district judge stanley s harris has asked the 
administrative office of the courts to consider asking the laws 
sponsors to amend its wording a spokeswoman for the administrative 
office cathy ball said the office was sympathetic but it was 
unclear what can be done timmer said she knew of no such pending 
legislation 
tucci said his agency was happy in many instances to have cases 
heard in federal courts elsewhere but that the 1989 law requires 
the agency to move the cases to federal court here before that can 
be done in other instances he said the rtc would rather try a 
case here 
in some cases thats terribly inconvenient and in some cases 
its not he said we look at each one on a casebycase 
basis

salim mansoor an iraqiamerican who met with saddam said on 
monday that 14 ailing or elderly americans would be freed 
several of the american men who left iraq today appeared to be 
very young and two were reportedly dependents of us diplomats it 
was not known why iraq decided to free the younger americans 
instead of sick and elderly people 
also today saudi arabias ambassador was summoned to the state 
department in washington where he denied the kingdom wants kuwait 
to yield territory to iraq in order to defuse the crisis in the 
persian gulf 
saddam should not be under any disillusion prince bandar 
said before meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii 
this is a decision for the kuwaitis not for us but we dont 
think aggression should be rewarded 
there have been indications that the arab world was softening 
its hard line in dealing with iraq including a statement by saudi 
king fahd that saddam would not lose face if he were to withdraw 
his troops 
if iraq took that step and restored the alsabah family as 
kuwaits rulers saudi arabia and egypt said there could be talks 
on the disputes that led to the invasion of the oilrich emirate 
in other developments former british prime minister edward 
heath met with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz today to arrange 
freedom for 50 or more britons there are an estimated 1400 
britons in kuwait and iraq 
kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah met in london 
today with british prime minister margaret thatcher to discuss the 
future of his nation mrs thatcher reportedly stressed that 
britain stands behind the united states in demanding that saddam 
withdraw all his troops unconditionally 
oil prices dropped by more than 5 a barrel monday amid reports 
the saudis might agree to let iraq keep some kuwaiti territory but

fluctuated wildly at one point topping 40 a barrel 
a kuwaiti newspaper in saudi arabia reported on monday that 
saddam had dreamed the prophet mohammed appeared before him and 
said iraqs missiles were pointed in the wrong direction 
the missiles are aimed toward saudi arabia where a usled 
multinational force is assembled 
middle east observers said the dream report indicated saddam 
could be preparing his people for a withdrawal from kuwait 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater with president bush in 
burlington vt said today of saddams reported dream no 
comment on dreams i have enough problem dealing with reality 
oil prices plunged monday following reported remarks made on 
sunday by saudi arabias defense minister prince sultan that arab 
nations are willing to grant iraq all its rights that was 
interpreted as a sign the saudis are prepared to agree to 
territorial concessions by kuwait 
the same day however prince sultan reiterated that any 
solution must provide for an unconditional iraqi pullout from 
kuwait and the return of the rule of the alsabah family 
a reporter who covered the speech for the associated press said 
the prince declared rights whether valid or doubtful could 
always be discussed but only after iraqi withdrawal with no 
mention of all rights 
king fahd and president hosni mubarak of egypt met today in 
jiddah saudi arabia and the monarch later said we would be 
thankful if iraq gave up kuwait fahds statements were 
distributed by the official saudi press agency 
it would be nothing to cause anxiety or pain but to the 
contrary if president saddam thought seriously about the matter he 
will find that it is in the interest of iraq in his personal 
interest and in the interest of the arab nation that he pull out 
from kuwait fahd said 
diplomatic sources said fahd and mubarak agreed iraqs 
withdrawal could be followed by negotiations on the disputes that 
preceded the invasion 
iraq had demanded territorial and financial concessions from 
kuwait including the islands of warba and bubiyan in the persian 
gulf and the kuwaiti section of the rumailah oilfield

the hardline leadership on tuesday dashed 
expectations it would ease its grip on society announcing a new 
campaign against western influences such as pornography and 
cracking down on crime 
hundreds of people have been executed in the 6monthold 
anticrime campaign which has been widely criticized by human 
rights groups 
a frontpage announcement in the communist party newspaper the 
peoples daily contradicted widespread expectations that the party 
would relax its tight social controls after the asian games ended 
oct 7 in beijing 
hong kong newspapers had predicted that more participants in 
last years failed democracy movement would be released from jail 
if the games went off smoothly 
but zhou chengkui spokesman for the national peoples congress 
said on monday he had no word of forthcoming releases 
tuesdays announcement indicated that chinas hardline 
leadership which has dominated chinese politics since crushing 
last years student protests has no plans to relax its hold 
in speeches carried in the peoples daily they called for 
vigilance against alleged antiparty forces 
at present our country is politically economically and 
socially stable said qiao shi the party official in charge of 
police matters 
but we must see clearly that the relatively smooth public 
order of these few months was achieved through the might of the 
anticrime struggle in ideology and in work we cannot relax one 
bit 
more than 720 people were sentenced to death from january to 
midaugust including more than 350 in june and july according to 
the international human rights group amnesty international most 
executions in china are carried out within a few days 
thousands of people have been arrested since the anticrime 
campaign began in may with some cities expanding their police 
forces and even forming civilian patrols 
in june 1989 the party launched a sixmonth antipornography 
campaign that also saw the seizure and destruction of prodemocracy 
publications 
liu zhongde who headed the campaign said a new drive to last 
through next spring will clean up remaining spiritual pollution 
and cultural garbage 
twelve percent of chinas newspapers 13 percent of its social 
science periodicals and more than 7 percent of its publishing 
houses have been closed down since june 1989 liu said 
thirtytwo million books and magazines were destroyed and nearly 
80000 people convicted for involvement in illegal publishing 
activity liu said 
this is still just a good beginning he said some obscene 
publications that have been explicitly banned have reappeared in 
new form 
he blamed this on the bourgeois liberal tide the partys 
phrase for westernstyle democratic ideas such as free speech and 
multiparty rule 
people who support bourgeois liberalism advocate complete 
westernization he said but complete westernization 
necessarily opens the door to corrupt and degenerate capitalist 
things and thus obscene things are spread

the state has agreed to pay a 
1000perday fine imposed by a federal judge for moving too 
slowly on plans to build a 50 million psychiatric hospital for 
prison inmates 
the state department of corrections will pay the fine on a 
weekly basis beginning friday spokeswoman gail light said 
on oct 12 us district judge richard enslen found the state 
in contempt of court for delaying the hospital project and ordered 
the fine to start monday 
the hospital was directed two years ago as part of an ongoing 
courtmonitored agreement between corrections officials and the 
us justice department to improve prison conditions in michigan 
under the agreement the legislature was supposed to provide 
full funding for the project by last july construction was to 
begin next april and the hospital was to be completed by april 
1993 
i dont think there was ever a dispute over whether we needed 
to build a psychiatric hospital light said monday we were 
just tring to explain to the judge that its been very difficult 
because the legislature hasnt provided funding and because the 
local communities are very recalcitrant about it being in their 
areas 
the hospital is proposed for the lansing area so that it could 
take advantage of michigan state university medical school programs 
and personnel but communities targeted by the department balked at 
the prospect 
to date the legislature has authorized only 50000 to study 
renovating or expanding existing psychiatric units 
state attorney general frank kelley said last week there was no 
basis for appealing the fine 
enslen also has warned the fine will increase to 10000 a day 
if the state does not get back on track with the project by march 
15 the legislature resumes deliberations in midnovember

americas evenings will darken a bit earlier 
as the nation returns to standard time sunday 
thats when most folks will have an extra hour to sleep carouse 
or whatever they like to do in the wee hours of the morning 
of course this is also the weekend some people will get stuck 
working an extra hour factory workers and convenience store 
clerks bartenders and police officers among them 
for most people though the time change simply means 
remembering to set the clock back an hour thats right back 
before retiring saturday night or upon arising sunday morning 
the official changeover will come at 2 am sunday ending more 
than a halfyear on daylightsaving time 
in the words of the uniform time act which set up the system of 
switching between daylight and standard times clocks are 
retarded an hour at 2 am on the last sunday in october 
the swap shifts an hour of sunlight from evening to morning 
making life a bit easier for youngsters waiting for school buses 
and for farmers working their fields 
safety experts are urging americans to use the timechange 
weekend as a reminder to put new batteries in their smoke 
detectors 
change your clock change your battery is the slogan of the 
effort which aims to make replacing these batteries an annual 
event 
it was during world war i that americans first tried 
daylightsaving time just 35 years after agreeing to a national 
time system 
the summertime shift begun in 1918 was designed to save fuel 
by reducing the need for lights in the evening allowing that 
energy to be turned to the war effort 
daylightsaving time was again in place in 1919 but was dropped 
nationally as a deluge of protests demanded that the system be 
abandoned in peacetime 
some states and localities kept the practice going however 
making the united states a summertime patchwork of daylight and 
standard time 
congress did away with most of the patchwork with the uniform 
time act of 1966 
actually daylight time is still not national as the law allows 
states to exempt themselves hawaii promptly opted out in 1967 
arizona in 1968 and indiana in 1972 
indiana isnt a complete exception though parts of the state 
observe daylight time parts dont

blacks were a key element in democratic 
election victories in the two midterm elections of ronald reagans 
presidency 
now president bush has vetoed a civil rights bill and raised 
the possibility of another outpouring of black votes this year 
there are places where if the black turnout is extraordinary 
as it was against reagan in 82 it could make a difference said 
william schneider a political analyst at boston college 
with election day only two weeks away the political question 
was whether the bush veto would arouse large numbers of people to 
go to the polls on nov 6 
does the veto boost black turnout in north carolina illinois 
ohio and other key states 
how much more motivation do blacks need in north carolina where 
conservative republican sen jesse helms is challenged by former 
charlotte mayor harvey gantt who is black 
but new motivation could make a difference in illinois where 
democrat neil hartigan and republican jim edgar are battling neck 
and neck to succeed jim thompson as governor thompson got the 
political scare of his life in 1982 when a huge black turnout 
nearly gave the governorship to democratic challenger adlai 
stevenson iii 
comparable conditions are easy to cite in that race the economy 
was in a recession that hit blacks hardest and the republican 
president was perceived as anticivil rights 
most independent polls in ohio have shown democrat anthony 
celebrezze trailing republican george voinovich in the governors 
race but this is another state where an unusually high black 
turnout could result in an election night surprise 
civil rights is a potent issue in american politics so are 
quotas bush acknowledged the potential conflict between those two 
issues in his veto message on monday 
he said the temptation to support a bill any bill simply 
because its title includes the words civil rights is very strong 
but when our efforts however wellintentioned result in 
quotas equal opportunity is not advanced but thwarted 
when the chips are down the white house is against civil 
rights said sen edward m kennedy dmass he called the action 
tragic and disgraceful 
on the political battlefields of the final two weeks of the 1990 
campaign democrats will sound that cry repeatedly they will tell 
black voters that bush is no different than reagan a president who 
never got more than 10 percent support from blacks by contrast in 
the 18 months of his presidency bushs approval ratings from 
blacks have been in the mid 40s 
on the other hand aversion to quotas a strong strain in the 
american electorate is unlikely to send people flocking to the 
polls to back republicans as a way of thanking bush for his veto 
that veto appeared certain to stand even sponsors of the 
legislation said there was virtually no chance of getting the 
twothirds margins in the house and senate to override 
the measure was the civil rights communitys top priority in 
congress it would overturn six job bias decisions handed down by 
the supreme court last year provisions range from a ban on racial 
harassment in the workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme 
cases of discrimination 
the sharpest clashes however have come over provisions that 
would make it easier to win discrimination cases against employers 
bush contended those provisions would force employers to set quotas 
to avoid lawsuits 
but the washington debate over the details of complex 
legislation is now a political debate what schneider called a 
contest in public relations 
during the budget negotiations in recent weeks the president 
lost the communications contest and was tagged with the perception 
of wanting to protect the rich from having to pay more taxes 
selling voters particularly blacks on the idea that he vetoed 
a civil rights bill to protect the country from quotas may prove 
even more difficult

and prison guards refused to escort inmates tuesday as justice 
ministry employees staged a nationwide strike for better pay and 
conditions 
in paris court clerks said they were short of basic equipment 
such as telephones and typewriters in bordeaux the chief judge of 
the childrens court said child abuse victims had to wait six weeks 
for cases to be heard 
in an unrelated strike public transit workers nationwide also 
walked off the job disrupting bus subway rail and trolley 
service in several major cities they were striking for better pay 
and administrative reform 
at several prisons guards refused to escort prisoners whether 
arriving for admission or leaving for transfers or court hearings 
in some cases guards also refused to allow visitors to enter 
in nancy a police squad was summoned to escort inmates through 
a picket line of guards 
in bordeaux where court activity was at a standstill the chief 
judge of the juvenile court said insufficient funding had created a 
crisis 
a minor who is in danger who has been raped or physically 
mistreated cannot obtain an appointment with a judge for at least 
a month and a half after the deed said judge denis hubert if 
tomorrow a child died i think the ministry would bear some 
responsibility 
in paris 1000 judges lawyers and court personnel rallied 
outside the palace of justice then marched to the office of 
premier michel rocard 
jeanluc sauon leader of a judges union said the 
demonstrators wanted the government to draw up a multiyear plan for 
the judicial budget he threatened paralysis of the judicial 
system unless rocard acted 
rocard told leaders of the judicial unions he did not plan to 
meet them and said they should address their demands to justice 
minister henri nallet 
the daylong transit walkout was most effective in bordeaux 
where striking drivers halted bus service by blocking the three bus 
depots the atlantic coast citys normal daily bus ridership is 
220000 
bus service also was disrupted extensively in lyon commuters 
forced to take their cars encountered huge traffic jams and even 
illegal parking places were hard to find 
in paris the daylong transit disruptions were less severe than 
anticipated the morning rush hour passed with few problems but 
service on most of the 13 subway lines was cut by at least half 
during the middle of the day as about 1500 transit employees 
joined a protest march 
unions organizing the transit strike were seeking a base salary 
of 1300 a month compared to 1060

saudi arabias ambassador denied today that 
his country wants kuwait to yield territory to iraq to settle the 
persian gulf crisis this is a decision for the kuwaitis not for 
us prince bandar said 
the saudi ambassador was summoned to the state department after 
reports quoting the saudi defense minister prince sultan had 
raised the possibility of giving iraq some kuwaiti territory to end 
its 2month occupation 
saudi arabia has not suggested there should be concessions 
made to anyone bandar said after meeting for more than an hour 
with secretary of state james a baker iii 
you cannot make aggression pay the saudi envoy said if 
you make aggression pay thats the law of the jungle 
at the same time bandar gave a downbeat assessment of the 
crisis there is nothing encouraging for me he said of various 
reports that a negotiated way out of iraqs occupation of kuwait 
might be looming 
we have not heard from anyone that iraq is willing to withdraw 
from kuwait he said 
later state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that 
bandar in his meeting with baker confirmed that the saudis had 
not changed their policy 
during their 85minute meeting no more than four minutes were 
devoted to press reports about a policy shift she said the 
remainder of the meeting she said involved a discussion of the 
overall situation in the gulf 
ms tutwiler added that the meeting was not called in response 
to the reports on prince sultans remarks 
bandar spoke to reporters both before and after his meeting with 
baker in an apparent attempt to erase any impression that the saudi 
defense minister who is his father was proposing kuwait cut a 
deal with iraq 
iraqi president saddam hussein should not be under any 
disillusion bandar said on his arrival at the state department 
this is a decision for the kuwaitis not for us the 
ambassador said but we dont think aggression should be 
rewarded 
of sultans comments bandar said he was not implying kuwait 
should do one thing or another he was talking about what we have 
doe with other countries negotiating as friends saddam did not 
choose that route 
in the past saudi arabia iraq and the united arab emirates 
have concluded territorial settlements 
bandar said the defense minister was talking about how 
disputes can be solved not by aggression which iraq had committed 
but by dialogue which iraq did not choose 
the ambassador responding to questions before seeing baker 
insisted there had been no softening of saudi arabias position in 
the 2monthold crisis 
saudi arabia has not changed its position at all he said 
we believe there should be unconditional implementation of the 
united nations resolutions 
the key resolution approved by the security council calls on 
iraq to withdraw from kuwait which it seized aug 2 and 
subsequently incorporated as a province 
baker has publicly ruled out partial solutions to the crisis 
and said saddam should not be permitted to benefit from the 
rape of a neighboring nation 
more than 200000 us troops are in saudi arabia in case iraq 
moves against that nation as well

national income growth decelerating from 21 percent in the first 
quarter to 13 percent from april through june it weakened in five 
of the nations eight regions

general economy which dipped from 17 percent in the januarymarch 
quarter to 04 percent in the next many economists believe the 
nation is headed for a recession if it is not already in one 
personal incomes fell 23 percent in iowa and 04 percent in 
nebraska for the plains region as a whole income growth dropped 
from 19 percent in the first quarter to just 03 percent in the 
second

slightly from 14 percent in the first quarter to 16 percent in 
the second personal ncomes in both the great lakes and new 
england states were unchanged 
the department defines personal income as income received by 
persons from all sources less social security payments 
the slowdown in personal income growth in the plains region 
reflected declines in farm income and in construction payrolls 
the report said in addition the payroll increase in retail 
trade was smaller in the second quarter than in the first 
income growth in the far west was cut in half from 32 percent 
in the first quarter to 16 percent in the second nevertheless 
three of the four states california oregon and nevada ranked 
among the top 10 in income growth 
a decline in durables manufacturing payrolls contributed to 
the slowdown the department said in addition payroll 
increases in the transportationcommunicationpublic utilities 
group and in wholesale and retail trade were smaller in the second 
quarter than in the first 
in the southeast personal income increased 12 percent after a 
27 percent gain in the first quarter 
declines in construction payrolls and in farm income 
contributed to the slowdown the report said moreover payroll 
increases in both durables and nondurables manufacturing and in 
retail trade were smaller in the second quarter 
the slowdown in the southwest from 17 percent in the first 
quarter to 13 percent in the second reflected declines in 
durables manufacturing payrolls and in farm incomes the study 
said in addition payroll increases in construction and in 
wholesale and retail trade were smaller 
personal income also dipped from 17 to 13 percent in the 
mideast because of declines in construction payrolls and in the 
transportationcommunicationpublic utilities group 
alaska and hawaii which are not included in a region ranked 
among the top 10 states in income growth alaska was first with a 
24 percent increase and hawaii ninth with a 16 percent gain

talk of secession has been in the air on staten 
island ever since it became the big apples smallest borough 92 
years ago on nov 6 voters may take a step toward making it 
reality 
fed up with what they see as inequities in services and a 
dwindling voice in local government voters in the citys most 
bucolic borough will finally get to vent their opinion on seceding 
from new york city 
a yes vote however would not send the island and its 350000 
residents floating swiftly toward independence it would simply 
authorize a threeyear statefinanced study of the fiscal and 
political ramifications of breaking away 
this is our chance our way of saying hey dont treat us 
this way were tired of being the cinderella of new york city 
said dennis papperman the secession party candidate for city 
council who would lose his job if staten island broke away 
nothing would please me more than to lose my job if we 
secede said the beauty supply store owner 
if the referendum passes a commission of 18 staten islanders 
would be chosen to study secession in three years a new charter 
would be submitted to voters although the legislature and governor 
would have final say 
secession talk has been around since 1898 when residents voted 
by the slimmest of margins to join the incorporated city of new 
york 
but for most of the century talk is all its been 
now its time to see if people really mean it said les 
trautmann an island native and editor of the staten island 
advance which has held forums and hung billboards urging voters to 
pass the issue 
many others led by borough president guy molinari dismiss the 
idea as financial suicide 
opponents warn that property taxes would quadruple after 
secession police fire and sanitation costs would increase and 
repairing a longneglected infrastructure would cost taxpayers 
dearly they believe 
if that thing passes thats it im outta here theres no 
way ill be able to afford living here said john liotta an 
apprentice carpenter 
other residents think the high cost of new york city living 
makes the proposed study appealing 
like were not paying through the nose for that stuff 
already anthony quinnela said while waiting for the ferry to 
manhattan 
to many outsiders staten island is the least known of the 
citys five boroughs many know it merely as the turnaround point 
for the staten island ferry or as home of the worlds largest 
garbage dump the 2000 acre 20storyhigh fresh kills landfill 
but to residents its a treelined refuge as recently as the 
1960s there were working farms and horse stables the crime rate 
remains comparatively low and public schools rank with the citys 
best 
the oftheard secession cry grew more urgent in 1989 when the 
us supreme court ruled the citys board of estimate 
unconstitutional under the oneman onevote rule the board which 
awarded city contracts was the only corner of government where 
staten islanders enjoyed as much political muscle as the more 
populated boroughs 
with the boards demise staten island was left with just two of 
31 city council seats a third will be added when the more powerful 
council expands to 51 members in 1991 
thats less representation than we have now said papperman 
at first many joked about staten island seceding 
the laughing stopped when a bill permitting the referendum 
passed the legislature and city attorneys failed to block the 
referendum vote in court 
the question of cost wont be the only consideration for some 
voters michele troy said shed simply miss the cachet of a new 
york city address 
i like telling people im from new york they think glamour 
excitement she said 
she tried out the alternative but wrinkled her nose im from 
staten island city sorry it just doesnt sound as good

supporters of a school bond measure are so 
worried the initiative has been lost in californias election 
avalanche that they are offering cash to schools that can find the 
measure in the voter booklet 
a 500 reward will go to four elementary or secondary schools 
that can name the page number in the 224page twopart ballot 
booklet where the argument in favor of proposition 146 is located 
the four schools will be picked by a drawing of the correct 
responses received by nov 1 with the money coming from the yes on 
146 campaign said campaign manager peter birdsall 
with 28 measures on the ballot the search may not be too easy 
he said 
we are concerned that people are not even aware that the 
school bond measure is on the ballot birdsall said 
proposition 146 would raise 800 million for construction and 
renovation of elementary and secondary schools in california

here at a glance are the latest developments in the persian 
gulf crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
fourteen americans left the iraqi capital for jordan today after 
being freed by saddam husseins government they departed as 
britain said 33 british hostages would leave iraq within hours 
about 1000 americans remain trapped in iraq and kuwait 
 
saudi arabias ambassador denied on tuesday that his country 
wants kuwait to yield territory to iraq to settle the persian gulf 
crisis this is a decision for the kuwaitis not for us prince 
bandar said he was summoned to the state department after reports 
quoting the saudi defense minister raised the possibility of giving 
iraq some kuwaiti territory to end its occupation 
 
the kuwaiti newspaper alseyassah reported that iraqi president 
saddam hussein told top aides that he dreamed mohammed appeared 
before him and told him i see your rockets deployed wrongly 
the dream could be an attempt to prepare iraqis psychologically for 
a pullout from kuwait which iraq invaded aug 2 
 
gen colin powell chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff 
said tuesday he has seen no evidence to support reports of iraqi 
troops pulling back from forward positions in kuwait powell is on 
an official visit to saudi arabia to confer with top commanders on 
his return to washington on thursday hes expected to recommend 
whether to extend the us buildup in the region 
 
oil prices were mixed on the futures market tuesday as uncertain 
traders tried to figure out which way crude would move after 
mondays record drop 
 
the persian gulf crisis is putting a severe strain on the tiny 
nations of the caribbean their frail economies and scant natural 
resources make them highly vulnerable to higher oil prices the 
ripple effects in the caribbean include higher food utility and 
transportation costs

nasa crews tuesday prepared for 
crucial fueltank loading tests that will determine if the space 
shuttles atlantis and columbia are leakfree and ready to fly 
work on the shuttles has been marred by mistakes including two 
accidents in three days involving metal beams one beam was left to 
bang around atlantis engine compartment when the shuttle was 
hoisted to an upright position earlier this month another crashed 
to the floor while being moved by a forklift 
i hate to say it but i think some of it has to do with the 
fact were not flying and were not paying as close attention as we 
should be said conrad nagel who is responsible for atlantis 
prelaunch operations 
discoverys trip this month with a sunexploring satellite was 
the first shuttle flight in 5 months 
with so many delays that has a negative affect on the 
workforce nagel said when things are moving along and people 
are doing their jobs and theyre active its a little different 
attitude 
getting through atlantis fueling test wednesday and columbias 
test monday should help nagel said atlantis has been grounded by 
hydrogen leaks since june columbia since may 
i think we need atlantis and columbia back up is the bottom 
line to be back on track said keith hudkins chief of the 
shuttle orbiter program 
even nasas astronauts have come under criticism the national 
transportation board said tuesday the space agency should take 
steps to prevent air accidents involving astronauts astronauts 
flying jets have had three close calls with other planes during the 
past 1 years the board said 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
hoped to vindicate at least atlantis on wednesday 
shortly before sunrise nasa was to begin loading liquid 
hydrogen into atlantis external tank at the launch pad the tank 
and fuel lines leading to it are new as are seals in a 
17inchdiameter valve 
liquid oxygen also will be pumped into atlantis main propulsion 
system to make sure there is no damage from the 9footlong 
47pound beam that was left in the engine compartment 
technicians forgot to remove the aluminum beam after using it 
for a platform and the piece crashed into about 25 spots as the 
orbiter was being raised into an upright position in the assembly 
building on oct 3 a small section of an overboard vent line for 
liquid oxygen had to be replaced 
an investigative team for lockheed space operations co nasas 
prime contractor for shuttle processing concluded friday the 
accident was the result of human error 
failure to follow procedures was responsible for the oct 5 
accident involving a beam that is part of a steel sling used to 
raise the orbiter lockheed spokesman jb kump said tuesday 
workers failed to secure the 60 to 70footlong beam to a 
forklift and the beam fell about 8 inches to the floor of the 
assembly building no injuries or damage were reported 
kump said appropriate disciplinary actions are being taken 
against workers in both cases 
forrest mccartney director of kennedy space center said hes 
very unhappy about the mishaps he met with workers in the 
assembly building last week and urged them to be a little bit 
more aware of what were doing 
columbias hydrogen leakage which is much more extensive than 
that of atlantis is at least partly due to worker error two seals 
were crushed when they were installed improperly after the 
shuttles last flight in january 
workers have since replaced the damaged seals part of valves on 
hydrogen lines leading to the shuttles main rocket engines 
if atlantis passes wednesdays test nasa hopes to send it on a 
classified pentagon mission around nov 9 or 10 mission managers 
will set a launch date following a flight readiness review that 
begins monday 
the mission originally was scheduled for july but was delayed 
when hydrogen leaks were detected during a fueling test in june 
nasa officials said they will try to launch columbia by the end 
of the year if mondays fueling test goes well or if any remaining 
leaks can be corrected quickly the shuttles astronomy mission 
already has endured four postponements

syrias vice president made a surprise 
visit to lebanon tuesday to try to boost government efforts to 
disarm rival militias in battletorn beirut officials said 
the visit followed weekend talks in damascus between president 
elias hrawi and syrian president hafez assad who renewed a pledge 
to support efforts to end lebanons 15yearold civil war and 
reunify the capital 
government sources said tuesdays talks dealt specifically with 
details of the withdrawal of the various militias from the beirut 
area 
tens of thousands of fighters belong to a dozen major militias 
both christian and moslem which are blamed for most of the 150000 
deaths in the civil war 
one source said vice president abdulhalim khaddams talk with 
lebanese officials was a message to all the militias that syria 
is serious in supporting government plans to achieve the withdrawal 
of militias from beirut and its suburbs 
the government source said hrawi wants beirut and its suburbs 
free of the militias by nov 22 to coincide with the 47th 
anniversary of lebanons independence from france 
the whole world supports the government decision to disband 
the militias the source said greater beirut will be the first 
step toward spreading state authority over all of lebanon 
hrawi has been reestablishing his governments authority since 
oct 13 when his army and syrian troops crushed the mutiny of 
christian gen michel aoun 
aoun who has taken refuge in the french embassy had opposed an 
arab leaguebrokered peace pact because it did not guarantee the 
complete withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops who have been in 
lebanon since 1976 the pact also grants equal rights to the 
countrys moslems and christians 
on his surprise visit khaddam met with hrawi a maronite 
catholic prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem and parliament 
speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem 
hrawi has assigned agriculture minister mohsen dalloul a shiite 
moslem and defense minister albert mansour a greek catholic to 
begin talks with the militia leaders 
involved in the talks would be leaders of the rightwing 
christian lebanese forces militia the proiranian hezbollah the 
mainstream shiite amal militia and druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party 
the beirut newspaper annahar said the syrians also would 
discuss hezbollahs control of the south beirut slums when iranian 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati visits damascus this week 
hezbollah is the umbrella for proiranian extremists holding 
most of the 13 missing westerners including six americans the 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press who was abducted march 16 1985

marine gunnery sgt leroy ford is 
sweating it out in the desert by his own choice he was close 
enough to retirement to stay back in the states but he volunteered 
to stay with his unit 
this is my last hurrah i didnt want to miss out he said 
i didnt want to read about this in the papers and say i should 
have been there 
ford 39 known as gunny by his troops is in the 1st marine 
expeditionary force stationed in eastern saudi arabia as part of 
operation desert shield 
a 19year veteran of the marine corps he is due to retire in 
march ford served a year in da nang vietnam and was part of the 
marine force in lebanon whose barracks was destroyed by a suicide 
bomber seven years ago tuesday 
fords unit was reassigned from lebanon to the philippines two 
days before the oct 23 1983 bombing by a shiite moslem which 
killed 241 americans mostly marines 
when i heard the news i wanted to go back and get them he 
said 
this is his first assignment to the middle east since 
with his combat experience hes sort of a father figure for a 
new breed of marines preparing for action in the blistering desert 
he remembers what its like to be a scared 18yearold private 
i talk with the guys all the time i joke with them they ask 
me what its like said ford a native of alexandria la who 
now lives in camp pendleton calif 
asked about the readiness of todays troops ford said they 
know what a bullet sounds like im not worried 
but in the next breath he noted that combat changes freshfaced 
volunteers into grizzled veterans in a hurry it makes you grow 
up faster ford said 
a gunnys job and part of his mystique is making sure his outfit 
has everything it needs from chow to spare parts even if it means 
bartering with other units or scrounging for gear 
his deserthardened troops enjoy having ford around they kid 
him about his sweatstained floppy hat and when he sang ill be 
home for christmas another marine needled him youll have a 
white christmas gunny white sand 
its good to have him around said navy corpsman jeff 
pruitt 24 seeking relief from the relentless desert sun in the 
shade of an armored vehicle he keeps us loose he tells us 
stories 
earlier this week fords alpha company got its first crack at 
the practice firing range zeroing in on targets with its 25mm 
cannons and m60 machine guns 
it gets the blood flowing you hear that bambambam said 
ford the father of four children 
when ford retires he wants to get into hotel management and 
perhaps open a restaurant back in louisiana 
the partys almost over ford said like my father said 
im going to have to get out of the marine corps and get a real 
job

cpr by paramedics saves almost as many elderly 
heartattack victims as it does younger ones and should not be 
abandoned for older people in an effort to eliminate useless 
procedures a study concludes 
some previous research of cardiopulmonary resuscitation has 
suggested the elderly may derive negligible benefit from attempts 
to revive them after outofhospital cardiac arrests survival 
rates in those studies were as low as 1 percent 
but a fiveyear study in seattle showed that 10 percent of 
cardiacarrest patients over age 70 who received cpr from 
paramedics survived not only long enough to get into the hospital 
but also long enough to go home that compared with a 14 percent 
survival rate in younger victims 
in the study period which ended in march 1988 paramedics 
treated 1407 outofhospital cardiac arrests among people age 70 
or older and 27 percent of the victims lived long enough to get 
admitted to a hospital 
during the same period paramedics treated 1624 younger 
patients for outofhospital arrests and the survival rate to 
admission was 29 percent said researchers led by dr wt 
longstreth jr of harborview medical center in seattle 
a total of 140 elderly patients survived after being released 
as did 223 younger patients the researchers reported in 
wednesdays journal of the american medical association 
paramedic cpr worked best on heart attacks marked by ventricular 
fibrillation a rapid uncoordinated and ineffective heartbeat 
caused by haywire electrical impulses in the lower heart chambers 
the researchers said 
the studys conclusions dont apply to patients who have heart 
attacks inside hospitals because those patients are much more 
likely to have other illnesses that reduce survival

after months of tortured negotiations a 
massive rewrite of the nations clean air laws came down to a 
dispute over helping coal miners whose jobs might be threatened by 
the bill 
congressional democrats were demanding a 250 million plan to 
give retraining and other benefits to workers whod lose their jobs 
because of stringent new environmental regulations one key 
lawmaker vowed to use a filibuster to kill any bill that was 
stripped of the worker benefit plan 
but for months the administration was opposed to the addition 
claiming it would lead to a costly new program the nation could ill 
afford 
then in the predawn hours monday the administration floated a 
compromise that softened key provisions of the plan it won swift 
acceptance clearing the way for final votes this week in the house 
and senate and the presidents likely approval 
the compromise had little to do with the overall bill which 
calls for tighter pollution controls on industry automobiles and 
utilities to reduce smog acid rain and toxic chemical releases 
but the resolution of this disagreement was like many other 
tradeoffs that marked months of closeddoor bargaining on the 
700page cleanair legislation 
they were looking to be accommodating said rep robert 
wise dwva of the white house 
members of congress were just as eager not wanting to see 
months of effort go for nothing 
the worker benefit program had been incorporated into the house 
bill at the urging of wise whose district includes both coal mines 
and large chemical plants 
an estimated 5000 to 15000 jobs are at risk because the bill 
calls for sharp reductions in acid rain pollutants which are 
likely to cause midwest utilities to shift away from using 
highsulfur coal 
but the bush administration for months has feared the program 
could easily get out of control and soar in costs senior 
administration officials made clear the president might veto the 
massive bill and scuttle the first comprehensive clean air 
changes in 13 years if the measure were included 
the final break came after midnight sunday when all 
pollutioncontrol issues had been worked out by negotiators for the 
house and senate under the watchful eye of the administration 
sources involved in the talks said roger porter the presidents 
domestic policy adviser floated the a compromise through sen john 
chafee ri 
workers who lose their jobs because of the new clean air 
requirements would get six months of additional financial 
assistance after unemployment compensation runs out similar to 
wises original proposal 
but rather than go to all workers benefits would be restricted 
to those who could show financial need 
this accord met with agreement by wise and the white house and 
eliminated another potential threat to the bill as well 
sen robert c byrd of west virginia had threatened to try and 
block the bill with a filibuster in the closing days of the 
congressional session if the worker provision were eliminated 
the byrd threat became more ominous when a group of disgruntled 
western senators including sen jake garn rutah said they were 
ready to filibuster if the bill imposed new clean air requirements 
to assure visibility in federal parks 
in the end when byrds objections were met a compromise was 
worked out to merely study the park visibility issue rather than 
impose new requirements 
like all compromises this one permitted both sides to claim 
victory 
white house officials pointed out that with worker assistance no 
longer an automaticbenefit costs can be contained 
although yet to endorse the completed bill publicly white house 
sources said the program for worker assistance is no longer a 
problem 
that shouldnt be surprising said a congressional source 
involved in the discussion they wrote it we watched them use 
the typewriter 
we got substantially what we wanted said wise noting that 
the dollar amount remained at 250 million over five years

defense secretary dick cheney will support a 
288 billion defense bill despite a wholesale cut in president 
bushs 1991 budget request for the strategic defense initiative 
the pentagon said tuesday 
the secretary did decide last night he would pose no 
objection to the military blueprint crafted by house and senate 
negotiators from the two chanbers differing bills said pentagon 
spokesman pete williams 
the legislation calls for slashing 18 billion from bushs 
proposal of 47 billion for sdi commonly known as star wars 
barely keeping alive the b2 bomber and sharply reducing spending 
on landbased nuclear missiles 
although cheney was disappointed with the amount of money 
earmarked for sdi he believes its a pretty good deal we got 
what we wanted in terms of strategic programs which we felt was 
essential williams told reporters 
the house and senate are expected to vote on the legislation 
within the next three days before sending it to the president for 
his signature 
shortly after negotiators announced an agreement on the bill 
last wednesday cheney signaled he would recommend a presidential 
veto of the legislation that sets spending ceilings for the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 
the pentagon opposed language restricting the spending on the 
sdi program provisions on base closings a troop cut of 100000 
and a plan to aid defense employees forced out of work by 
diminishing military budgets 
congressional staff and pentagon officials worked throughout the 
weekend to reach a compromise finally settling on changes that in 
some cases make minor alterations in language but in others give 
cheney more leeway 
the reduction in sdi remains the same but language limiting how 
the money can be spent has been modified its not as rigid in 
terms of preventing the sdi office from transferring money from one 
category to another willilams said 
the legislation provides cheney with added flexibility on troop 
cuts negotiators agreed on a reduction of 100000 from the 21 
million troops worldwide added to the bill was authority for the 
defense secretary to limit the cut to 80000 based on the us 
military buildup in the persian gulf 
pentagon officials and congressional staff also changed details 
in the provision setting up an independent commission to recommend 
military bases for closing or realignment the revisions have no 
impact on the overall concept 
the bill makes no change on the issue of the b2 stealth bomber 
providing 41 billion for the air force program in fiscal 1991 
there is no restriction in the legislation that would prevent 
us from pursuing the next aircraft williams said referring to 
the administrations plan to purchase bombers no 16 and no 17 
while the pentagon was issuing its interpretation rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee was 
telling lawmakers that schedule delays and cost overruns on the 
first 15 planes will consume most of the money 
the fix is in on the b2 aspin said in an appearance before 
the house rules committee

six months after harvard law schools 
first tenured black professor took an unpaid leave to protest the 
lack of black women on the faculty that goal hasnt been realized 
but there are other effects of his action 
derrick bell says he also wanted to show students many who 
might be eyeing highflying careers that they need to take risks 
for what they believe in its a principle bell has lived by for 
years 
i think its important that they understand the difference 
between talking a good game and actually doing something actually 
being able to stand up when everyone else is sitting down to take 
a stand when everybody else is keeping silent he said 
bells decision in april to take a leave of absence received 
great publicity although he now says he is a bit embarrassed by 
the attention 
this weekend dozens of bells former students returned to 
harvard to praise him for his protest 
the issue of appointing a black female professor was raised last 
month at the first faculty meeting of the academic year 
afterward law school dean robert c clark sent a letter to 
students saying diversity is clearly an issue that the faculty 
takes seriously and it will be one of its central concerns over the 
course of this year 
detlev vagts a professor on the appointments committee said he 
thought the impact of bells protest would be marginal 
it keeps us from forgetting the question but we werent on 
the point of forgetting vagts said he said the school has a 
relatively small pool of candidates to choose from in seeking a 
black female professor and one has to be in the top plateau 
the law school has 62 tenured professors including three black 
males the school this year also has 18 visiting professors and 
one is a black woman 
of the 1611 students 183 are black and 106 of those students 
are women according to figures from the school 
bell said he sent letters to the dean and other faculty saying 
he felt he could not be a role model for black female students but 
he saw little action 
my response to frustration is to do something said bell 
who turns 60 next month its particularly my response when im 
thwarted by people who say ive got the power you cant do 
anything 
bell points out that he has acted this way before 
in the late 1950s bell had a job with the us justice 
department but his superiors ordered him to give up his membership 
in the national association for the advancement of colored people 
claiming there was a conflict of interest 
bell disagreed and quit his job after working a year for the 
naacp in pittsburgh bell was asked by thurgood marshall to join 
the staff of the naacp legal defense fund 
bell says he has been rewarded by confronting 
while bell has lost his salary he makes money by accepting 
invitations to lecture 
bell still holds his tenured position he continues to work out 
of his law school office and he even decided to teach his regular 
fall seminar on civil rights although this year the 25 students 
enrolled are not receiving any credit 
bell will continue his leave until a black woman receives tenure 
at the law school and he doesnt appear concerned about the 
automatic loss of tenure if he remains on leave for two years 
its a no loss situation he said ive done what i want 
to do if the students get encouraged fine if not at least i 
tried

occupied west bank and the gaza strip will be banned from entering 
israel beginning wednesday morning the military command said those

the travel ban will remain in effect for several days until 
tensions are reduced israel television said 
arens order came hours after israeli civilians fired on an arab 
car in the southern negev desert killing one palestinian laborer 
and wounding his three cousins 
doctors at nasser hospital in the gaza strip town of khan yunis 
identified the victim as maher al shaher 30 one of the wounded

palestinian reporters said the four were returning from work in 
israel when they came under fire from a red usmade jeep in 
mivtahim near gaza the israeli news agency itim said the injured 
palestinians managed to get to an army roadblock and reported the 
attack to soldiers there 
the army confirmed the palestinians were apparently shot by 
jewish civilians firing from a car and said the attack was being 
investigated by police 
earlier today a west bank palestinian knifed two unarmed women 
soldiers in ashkelon and another arab bludgeoned two israelis in 
the head with a hammer in a wave of attacks on jews in israel 
police said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir assured israelis that steps were 
being taken to protect them 
we are increasing security measures and security forces in all 
parts of the country shamir told reporters after a speech in tel 
aviv 
arens accused palestinian groups of escalating violence in 
israel to divert world attention from the persian gulf crisis 
police spokesman yehoshua butbul said the wounded women soldiers 
were rushed to rambam hospital in the nearby port of haifa and that 
the assailant was caught by other soldiers 
one of the women was in serious condition with a knife wound in 
the chest that punctured a lung said dr albert suttinger deputy 
director of rambam 
the other suffered a superficial back wound suttinger said the 
victims names were not immediately released 
the attack occurred this morning as the soldiers waited for a 
ride near the kiryat tivon butbul said

palestinian from the occupied west bank stopped and the driver got 
out israel radio reported from the scene 
he took out a knife and started to stab the soldiers the 
radio said adding that the women were not armed

we chased him and then he threw down the knife and we grabbed 
him one israeli civilian eli koman told israel radio we 
held him down and shouted at the soldiers to shoot and kill him 
they wouldnt i asked one of them to give me his rifle he 
refused 
an offduty bus driver identified as albert benezra told army

saudi arabias ambassador sought tuesday to 
puncture reports that the persian gulf crisis is easing or that his 
government proposes allowing iraq to hold on to some kuwaiti 
territory in exchange for an end to iraqs occupation 
there is nothing that is encouraging for me prince bandar 
said after reviewing the situation for 85 minutes with secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
we have not heard from anyone that saddam hussein is willing 
to withdraw from kuwait the envoy said referring to the iraq 
presidents aug 2 invasion of the oilrich emirate that prompted 
president bush to send more than 200000 us troops to defend 
saudi arabia 
some of the speculation of a peaceful resolution was based on 
reports in the new york times and elsewhere that prince sultan the 
saudi defense minister who is bandars father had raised the 
possibility of allowing iraq to have some kuwaiti territory as an 
outlet to the gulf 
but bandar in two sessions with reporters in the doorway of the 
state department insisted the reports were off the mark 
this is a decision for the kuwaitis not for us bandar 
said 
saudi arabia has not suggested there should be concesions 
made to anyone the ambassador added 
according to the reports sultan said we in saudi arabia have 
given parts of our land and parts of our territorial waters 
willingly but this came through good will noble manners and 
brotherhood 
he referred apparently to territorial settlements concluded in 
the past by saudi arabia iraq and the united arab emirates 
the iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat responded on abctvs 
good morning america that this speaks of a readiness to 
negotiate which was always the case with us 
but bandar ruled out any dividends for saddam hussein a 
position strongly stressed by baker in congressional testimony last 
week 
you cannot make aggression pay the saudi envoy said if 
you make aggression pay thats the law of the jungle 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said bandar had 
confirmed to baker that the saudis had not changed their policy 
bandar said saddam should not be under any disillusion 
the ambassador said his father the defense minister was not 
implying kuwait should do one thing or another he was talking 
about what we have done with other countries negotiating as 
friends saddam did not choose that route 
asked if saudi arabia which with egypt forms the backbone of 
the arab alliance against iraq had softened its stand bandar 
replied no absolutely not

the us senates decision to 
slash military aid to el salvador was a defeat for president 
alfredo cristiani but some salvadoran leaders say the vote may get 
peace talks moving 
justice minister oscar santamaria called fridays vote to halve 
the 85 million in previously alloted military aid the result of 
successful incursions by the fmln in washington 
he was referring to the farabundo marti national liberation 
front the leftist rebel army that for 11 years has waged a civil 
war against a succession of usbacked governments 
its not as if we dont need the aid because those fighting 
the system those in the fmln are still waging their battle 
santamaria said monday 
but santamaria head of the government delegation to peace talks 
with the rebels also emphasized that the us move provides an 
incentive to the fmln to contribute more to the success of the 
peace process 
according to the aid bill the slashed 425 million would be 
restored if the guerrillas launch a major offensive or if they fail 
to demonstrate good faith in the negotiations 
all military aid would be cut off if the government withdraws 
from the peace negotiations 
peace talks have bogged down on the issue of the future role of 
the armed forces 
the rebels demand a drastic purge and reduction of security 
forces that would culminate in the demilitarization of 
salvadoran society 
the government says it is in favor of weeding out negative 
elements from the army but it rejects a wholesale purge 
monsignor gregorio rosa chavez roman catholic auxiliary bishop 
of san salvador told a news conference sunday that the aid cut 
gives rise to signs of hope because it is a recognition that 
peace cannot be constructed with arms 
he said the congressional move makes the peace process more 
viable 
rebel and government negotiators are scheduled to resume peace 
talks nov 4 in mexico 
juan jose martell a leader of the leftist popular social 
christian movement said the reduction and conditioning of the aid 
is a positive message to both sides in the conflict 
the legislators are saying to the government if you behave 
badly we cut it all and theyre saying to the fmln if you 
launch an offensive or negotiate in bad faith youll be 
contributing to the restoration of all the aid this is a way of 
saying the negotiation must progress and peace must come soon 
said martell 
but the defense minister col rene emilio ponce said the cut 
in aid constituted a negative signal to everything that 
represents the countrys institutionality and a positive signal to 
the belligerent adventure planned by the fmln it would prolong the 
conflict 
he said the cut would mean limits on the logistical and 
operational fields but the armed forces have been preparing to 
face this situation for some time 
more than 70000 people have been killed in the civil war and 
many of the deaths have been blamed on rightwing death squads 
operating in cooperation with the military several military 
officials have been charged in the murders last year of six jesuit 
priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
people are just fed up with this thing sen christopher 
dodd dconn said after the friday vote referring to the 
millions of dollars in us aid sent to el salvador over the past 
decade

twelve years after toxic waste bubbling out 
of the ground forced the evacuation of love canal the government 
and the company that dumped the waste are going to court wednesday 
to begin dividing up the bill 
as much as 700 million is at stake for occidental chemical 
corp and four levels of government the city of niagara falls its 
school board new york state and the federal government 
the twophase nonjury trial is expected to last more than two 
years 
after toxic waste began seeping into basements and backyards in 
the middleclass niagara falls neighborhood love canal quickly 
became a symbol of the nations hazardous waste problems 
president carter declared a state of emergency in the 
neighborhood in the summer of 1978 and about 2500 people left 
their homes nearly 300 houses were bulldozed hundreds more remain 
boarded up despite a state agencys efforts to resettle part of the 
area 
occidental already has been found liable for at least some of 
the cleanup costs because a company it purchased in 1968 hooker 
chemicals and plastics co created the dump in 1942 dallasbased 
occidental paid 20 million in 1984 to settle a separate lawsuit 
brought by 1345 former love canal residents 
occidental attorney thomas h truitt said tuesday the company 
does not dispute that hooker dumped 21800 tons of dioxin 
pesticide byproducts and other highly toxic chemicals in an 
abandoned canal bed dug in the 1890s by an entrepreneur named 
william love 
truitt said occidental expects it will have to pay most of the 
actual cleanup costs which the state and federal governments have 
estimated at 140 million 
we put the stuff in the canal truitt said its our 
stuff 
the state is also seeking 310 million for damages to the 
environment for creating a public nuisance and for interest and 
250 million in punitive damages for what it claims was hookers 
reckless conduct at the dump 
lawyers for both sides said it is unprecedented for a state to 
seek punitive damages in a toxicdumping case the first two months 
of the trial are expected to focus on that claim 
occidental argues the dump was wellbuilt by the standards of 
the 1940s and would not have leaked had the school board and 
later the city and a private developer not dug it up to build 
roads houses and an elementary school 
a warning about the buried wastes was written into the deed when 
the company sold the dump to the school board in 1953 and the 
company says it sent lawyers to a school board meeting in 1957 to 
repeat the warning when the board first began thinking of selling 
off part of the property 
the state concedes the warnings were made but contends they were 
innocuously worded compared to what hooker knew at the time was 
going on at the dump 
the deed refers only to waste products resulting from the 
manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its plants which 
could have meant harmless rubbish eugene martinleff the top 
state lawyer in the case wrote in a pretrial brief 
after deciding the punitivedamage issue judge john t curtin 
will take two to four months more to hear occidentals arguments 
that the federal state and city governments and the school board 
should share the responsibility because they either dumped on the 
property or owned it after hooker 
once the judge has ruled who is liable the trial will recess 
for about 18 months while the lawyers prepare arguments over how 
much each party should pay

zephania mothopeng who broke 
away from the african national congress to help form and lead the 
militant pan africanist congress died tuesday he was 77 
he had been suffering from cancer and pneumonia and was listed 
in critical condition the past week by doctors at johannesburg 
hospital anglican archbishop desmond tutu another major 
antiapartheid figure visited the pac president earlier tuesday 
mothopeng lived his last years a few blocks from the soweto 
homes of fellow black nationalists nelson mandela and walter 
sisulu but his militant stance kept him far from the more moderate 
anc leaders 
like mandela and sisulu mothopeng spent years in prison for his 
political activities like his neighbors the imprisoned mothopeng 
became a symbol of the black struggle against the government 
his release from johannesburgs diepkloof prison in november 
1988 preceded reforms that included freedom for the anc leaders and 
government promises to include blacks in a new constitution 
in their first public statements after being freed both 
mothopeng and mandela urged the continuation of the armed struggle 
against the government but unlike mandela and other anc leaders 
mothopeng opposed talks with the government intended to pave the 
way for a new constitution 
the pan africanist congress refuses to recognize the whiteled 
government and opposes sharing power 
power should be returned to the indigenous africans mothopeng 
said 
the question is one of the repossession of our land from 
foreign colonial oppressors he said in an interview this year 
our liberation will be brought about by the africans 
themselves by having to struggle for it they will not achieve it 
at the negotiating tables he said 
mothopeng was born sept 10 1913 in south africas orange free 
state and became involved in politics in 1940 when he joined the 
ancs youth wing in 1959 unhappy with the ancs contact with 
activists of other races mothopeng and others broke away from the 
anc and formed the pan africanist congress 
it is a militant group compared to the anc urging black 
selfreliance in the land mothopeng calls azania the pac contends 
blacks must struggle for their freedom and find dignity in the 
process rather than gaining equality through white concession or 
compromise 
mothopeng was jailed three times for his political activities 
the longest stretch beginning in 1976 after his conviction on 
terrorism charges he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and 
elected president of the pan africanist congress in 1986 while 
imprisoned 
mothopeng was diagnosed with throat cancer while in prison and 
the disease spread to other parts of his body the government 
released him after 12 years

king fahd said tuesday that saddam 
hussein would not lose face if he withdrew from kuwait and egypts 
hosni mubarak expressed hope the persian gulf crisis would end 
without bloodshed 
the remarks taken together with earlier comments by defense 
minister prince sultan appeared to be the most conciliatory 
messages to the iraqi leader since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but saudi arabia also insisted that prince sultan had been 
misquoted and denied it wants kuwait to yield territory to iraq in 
order to defuse the crisis those reports had helped push oil 
prices down more than 5 a barrel monday 
the saudis reasserted tuesday that saddam must pull out his 
troops from kuwait unconditionally 
the correct reply is to remedy the mistake of invading 
kuwait fahd told reporters in remarks distributed by the 
official saudi press agency 
it would be nothing to cause anxiety or pain but to the 
contrary if president saddam thought seriously about the matter 
he would find that it is in the interest of iraq in his personal 
interest and in the interest of the arab nation that he pull out 
from kuwait fahd said in jiddah the saudi summer capital 
in arab culture losing face is considered a major dishonor 
arab conflicts traditionally are handed over to a respected 
mediator trusted by both sides if his decision is accepted by both 
sides face can be preserved 
so far apart from early efforts by king hussein of jordan no 
such mediator has emerged 
mubarak the egyptian president visited saudi arabia to meet 
with some of his 14000 troops deployed at the northeastern region 
of hafr albatin and told them their presence was meant to force 
him who lost his reason to return to it 
he also expressed egypts hope that the gulf crisis end 
without bloodshed or war 
addressing his soldiers mubarak warned against any settlement 
of the kuwait crisis that does not provide for reinstating the 
deposed alsabah family 
only the people of kuwait have the right to choose their 
government and regime mubarak said 
on sunday prince sultan the saudi defense minister insisted 
on an unconditional iraqi pullout from kuwait and suggested that 
after such a withdrawal negotiations could be held to consider 
iraqs longstanding border dispute with kuwait 
prince sultan third in the saudi leadership after king fahd and 
crown prince abdullah said that rights whether valid or 
doubtful could always be discussed but only after iraqi 
withdrawal 
some took the princes remarks as a sign that the saudis were 
ready to agree to territorial concessions by kuwait this was a 
factor in a plunge in oil prices on monday 
prince sultan subsequently issued a statement to clarify 
wrong interpretations of his words reaffirming that the 
kingdom categorically rejects the iraqi aggression on sister 
kuwait 
in washington meanwhile prince bandar the saudi ambassador 
and prince sultans son also denied his kingdom wants kuwait to 
concede territory 
prince bandar was summoned to the state department to clarify 
saudi policy he spoke after meeting with secretary of state james 
a baker iii 
in the saudi resort town of taif a spokesman for the kuwaiti 
government in exile stressed that prince sultan had been 
misquoted 
the spokesman who by custom was not identified by name said 
the exiled governments view was that there can be no 
negotiations and no conditions regarding an iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait 
he said the exiled government believed there had been no change 
in saudi policy

the state department accused the burmese 
military tuesday of a total disregard for human rights in the 
reported raids on buddhist monasteries 
troops in the southeast asian country arrested 20 monks at one 
buddhist monastery tuesday and surrounded 11 other monasteries in 
burmas religious center of mandalay as part of a crackdown on 
dissent according to sources in rangoon 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said burmese 
government radio reports said 133 monasteries were raided on 
monday she said department officials could not determine how many 
monks had been arrested 
burmese monks have been refusing to provide religious services 
for soldiers or their families which in the buddhist religion is 
the equivalent of excommunication 
the monks actions followed the aug 8 suppression of a protest 
in mandalay western diplomats said two monks and two other people 
were killed in the confrontation 
the united states views these raids as one more proof of the 
regimes total disregard for human rights ms tutwiler said 
its object seems to be the suppression of even token opposition 
in burma we strongly condemn this latest action by the burmese 
military 
ms tutwiler also reiterated the us call for the burmese 
military government to transfer power to a civilian government and 
release all political prisoners 
the government of gen saw maung has refused to turn over power 
despite the overwhelming victory in may elections of the opposition 
national league for democracy opposition leaders have been jailed 
and human rights groups accuse the military government of 
widespread abuses

a rightwing hindu party deserted prime 
minister vp singhs coalition tuesday depriving the government 
of a parliamentary majority but singh pledged to hang on to power 
the walkout was prompted by the arrest tuesday of the rightist 
partys leader who had stirred tension between hindus and moslems 
by campaigning for a new hindu temple on the site of a moslem 
mosque 
singh went on national television to appeal for calm fearing 
the political turmoil arising from a conflict between hindus and 
moslems could provoke violence 
at this moment and it is a very tense moment my heart goes 
out to the innocent children men women who today are under 
tension and under fear he said 
initial reports said scattered violence erupted around the 
country united news of india said three people were stabbed to 
death during rioting in ahmedabad in western india 
at least 80 people died this month in riots between hindus and 
moslems they usually were set off by minor squabbles but were 
attributed to the hindu temple dispute 
despite the defection singh said he was not quitting and will 
command enough support to maintain his 10monthold government when 
parliament reconvenes privately his aides said it was unlikely 
the government would complete its fouryear term and an early 
election was probable next year 
the legislature is in recess for another three weeks although 
president ramaswamy venkataraman has the power to convene it early 
venkataraman could let events in parliament take their course 
when it begins its session next month he also could ask the 
opposition congress party the largest in parliament to try to 
form a new government or he could call early elections 
the government has been transferred from intensive care to the 
terminal ward said vn gadgil a congress party spokesman his 
party was ousted in last years election 
officials in singhs janata dal party said they believed the 
hindu party the bharatiya janata party would stop short of voting 
against the government since there was no viable alternative 
the hindu partys leaders said they would consider rejoining 
singhs coalition if singh were replaced 
singhs minority national front government relied on the hindu 
party and on the communistled left front to stay in office 
neither was formally part of the government 
the political crisis was prompted by the arrest of the hindu 
partys president lal krishna advani during his crosscountry 
crusade for building a hindu temple where a mosque now stands in 
the hindu holy town of ayodhya 
advani was detained at dawn near the village of samastipur 450 
miles southeast of new delhi 
charges against advani were not published but up to 20000 of 
his supporters were put under preventative arrest to stop what 
authorities feared could become a bloodbath between the two 
communities the hindu party claimed the figure was closer to 
50000 
hindus say the 16th century mosque was built on the ruins of an 
earlier temple on the site where the hindu god lord rama was born 
a fundamentalist hindu group says it will begin building a new 
temple there oct 30 defying a court injunction 
thousands of moslems and hindus have died in the long history of 
communal bloodshed in the indian subcontinent violence prompted 
the partition of colonial india into moslem pakistan and 
predominantly hindu india when britain granted independence in 
1947

the pentagon is considering a new wave of 
troop deployments to the persian gulf officials said tuesday such 
a move would take the gulf buildup beyond the 240000troop force 
now planned 
the decision is important because the deployment of more 
american ground units to saudi arabia could transform operation 
desert shield from a force capable only of defending against a 
possible iraqi attack to one tailored to launching an offensive 
officials also said evidence is emerging that un economic 
sanctions against iraq for its aug 2 invasion of kuwait are 
beginning to hamper iraqi military operations 
pete williams a spokesman for defense secretary dick cheney 
said more than 210000 us forces now are in and around saudi 
arabia as part of operation desert shield to defend the desert 
kingdom against a possible iraqi attack thats 10000 more than 
the last official count issued by cheney on oct 13 
williams said gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff was in saudi arabia this week to consult with us and 
saudi officials on the possible need to expand desert shield 
deployments which president bush ordered aug 7 
powell will report his recommendations to cheney after returning 
to washington on thursday williams said 
then those decisions will be made on whether additional forces 
need to be sent or not williams said so i dont want to 
signal that the deployment is nearly complete thats a decision 
that will be made in part this week by gen powells visit 
in comments to reporters in riyadh the saudi capital powell 
said tuesday that he and gen norman schwarzkopf the commander of 
all us forces in the gulf area had explored all options for 
desert shield powell declined to comment specifically on 
additional troop deployments 
williams said it had been planned all along that us troop 
requirements in the gulf would be reassessed once the initial round 
of deployments was nearing completion 
us ground forces in saudi arabia now include four army 
divisions three marine corps expeditionary brigades an air 
defense artillery brigade a mechanized infantry brigade and an 
armored cavalry regiment also in the gulf area are more than 500 
aircraft and 55 ships including aircraft carriers and a 
battleship 
an army source speaking on the condition of anonymity said it 
was also possible that powell would recommend reducing the number 
of american forces in the region depending on military estimates 
of iraqs troop strength and other factors 
bush repeatedly has said he has not ruled out the use of force 
to push iraqi troops from occupied kuwait 
williams said us intelligence estimates put iraqi troop 
strength in kuwait and southern iraq at 430000 unchanged over 
the last month he added that american authorities have no evidence 
to substantiate recent news reports that iraqi forces are pulling 
back from the saudi border to fortify defenses to the north 
the iraqi military remains capable of launching an offensive 
strike with little warning williams said although its operations 
are starting to be hurt by the effects of the un sanctions which 
have cut off most trade with iraq 
williams cited iraqs recent announcement of rationing civilian 
gasoline supplies as a sign that even the military is threatened by 
the economic embargo he said the iraqi military is short of tires 
spare parts and other supplies and has been forced to make some 
adjustments in its operations in kuwait 
he did not elaborate but said of the iraqis 
as time goes by the sanctions continue to have effect it 
becomes harder and harder to support that military force as the 
embargo restricts the shipment of spare parts and supplies

a deposed kgb general accused his former bosses in 
court tuesday of stripping his rank honors and pension to punish 
him for publicly criticizing the intelligence agency 
if he wins reinstatement oleg kalugins civil lawsuit against 
the kgb could become a landmark for soviet citizens seeking 
protection for free speech and challenging the secrecy of 
government decisions 
the 55yearold former general who was an intelligence agent in 
the united states from 1958 to 1970 contends in the suit that kgb 
chairman vladimir kryuchkov secretly ordered his demotion in june 
kalugin claims the order was in retaliation for comments he made 
to the soviet press and on television that the kgb was resisting 
reform and continuing to spy on citizens opposed to the communist 
party 
i think kryuchkovs actions represent not only arbitrary rule 
against me personally but also a form of legal gangsterism and i 
cant call it anything else he told the threejudge panel in 
moscow city court 
kryuchkov has denied the allegations he did not attend the 
hearing the second since the trial opened oct 2 the kgb has 
alleged the orders for kalugins dismissal were received from the 
council of ministers or national cabinet and no specific reasons 
have been given for his firing 
kalugins fight with the kgb has made him a popular hero and 
helped him win a seat in the 2250member soviet congress 
representing the southern russian city of krasnodar the judges 
repeatedly had to call for order as the room full of spectators 
applauded kalugins lawyer and heckled the kgbs attorney 
oh my weve hurt the kgbs feelings isnt that too bad an 
elderly woman called out sarcastically after the kgb lawyer viktor 
alexeyev complained about the outbursts 
kalugins attorney boris a kuznetsov argued that the 
13member council of ministers never met to consider kalugins 
case he said the order was signed by prime minister nikolai i 
ryzhkov at kryuchkovs behest and that documents later were 
fabricated to make it look as though the full council approved 
after listening to both sides the judges adjourned the case 
until midnovember chief judge nikolai romanenkov said they were 
waiting for answers to questions they sent last month to the 
council of ministers and military prosecutors office 
the court asked the council of ministers to provide documents 
about how when and why the decision was made to strip kalugin of 
his rank the military prosecutor was asked to describe the status 
of a possible criminal lawsuit against kalugin 
soviet newspapers have said the prosecutor was investigating 
kalugin on a potential charge of revealing state secrets 
the former general has said he once headed the kgbs section on 
counterintelligence he has denied revealing any national secrets 
the kgbs efforts to disgrace him are illegal they are not 
based on any laws of the soviet state they contradict common 
sense and they violate the human rights of a person who served in 
the armed forces for more than 30 years kalugin told the court 
at the oct 2 hearing viktor alexeyev chief of the kgb legal 
department told the court that the agency revoked kalugins 
military pension after he was demoted in accordance with a soviet 
law alexeyev told said the kgb decision was based on an order the 
council of ministers issued june 29 
the kgb is considered a branch of the armed forces responsible 
for guarding borders protecting top officials collecting 
intelligence abroad and combatting both foreign spies and soviet 
criminals 
kalugins accusations hit the kgb particularly hard last summer 
because the agency had just begun a public relations campaign to 
change its image 
through interviews films and television shows the agency has 
sought to convince soviets it is concerned with counterespionage 
and fighting corruption and has given up harassing dissidents and 
tapping telephones

presidential scholar richard neustadt no fan 
of former president reagan emerges as a defender of reagans wife 
nancy in a new edition of his classic study presidential 
power 
never let your nancy be immobilized could be a rule of thumb 
for future presidents neustadt writes 
the harvard professor argues that reagan could have saved 
himself a lot of trouble if the first lady had been able to advise 
him on the irancontra affair 
she could not he says because reagan relied on the late 
william j casey the secretive director of the central 
intelligence agency in such a way as to cut nancy off from 
knowledge of the armsforhostages deal 
neustadts description of mrs reagans role as an adviser 
contrasts with that of fired white house chief of staff donald t 
regan who revealed in his memoirs that some of her advice on 
matters of the presidents schedule depended on astrology 
this neustadt concedes was silly to be sure though 
possibly no more so than the whims of staff or press or 
partisans or family quite traditional in such decisions 
but when it came to people her reported targets seem well 
chosen aim unerring and timing right for someone who must wait for 
someone else to pull the trigger he writes 
mrs reagan was widely reported to have pressed for the removal 
of regan who was dismissed in 1987 after criticism of his handling 
of the irancontra affair and attorney general edwin meese iii 
who resigned in 1988 after a special prosecutor completed an 
investigation of him without seeking an indictment 
nancy reagan was perhaps that rarity a disinterested 
adviser neustadt says alternatively perhaps she was 
neurotically obsessed as her detractors hint either way her 
husbands close associates however valuable or liked or even 
loved were to be sacrificed in her view from the moment their 
continuation on the scene could compromise the presidents public 
relations 
in a telephone interview neustadt said i must say i was 
offended by some of the attacks on her which it seemed to me took 
no account either of her loyalty or the position she was in but i 
wasnt trying to cheer or jeer or anything thats the best i could 
understand so thats the way i put it 
neustadt said former president carters wife rosalynn 
apparently was in her way as close to her husband as mrs reagan 
seems to have been to ronald reagan but mrs carter as best i 
understand it was someone he was interested in consulting 
about all his affairs and interested in substance and politics 
thats not my impression of mrs reagan she was interested in him 
and in his reputation and his place in history 
the author said the role of president eisenhowers wife mamie 
was much more that of a conventional wife 
he said bess truman who had been an assistant in president 
trumans office when he was a senator was in her public demeanor 
totally selfeffacing but in private had felt herself to be a 
private counselor to her husband on everything 
in his book neustadt writes that president franklin d 
roosevelts wife eleanor was a substitute for legs hence eyes 
and ears outside her husbands physical confines she also was an 
inescapable and often useful hairshirt on social issues but she 
was not an intimate nancy reagan on the other hand specialized 
in intimacy 
he describes her as the presidents closest perhaps only 
friend 
the author portrays reagan as inexperienced in foreign affairs 
and strikingly lacking in intellectual curiosity 
personally i prefer presidents of the other sort more 
skeptical than trustful more curious than committed more nearly 
roosevelts than reagans he says 
still it may be that his greatest lack was not experience 
direct or indirect but rather anything to activate the aide in 
charge of warning him when threats appeared against his public 
standing or historical appeal 
that special staff role of immense importance to someone 
habitually incurious about detail had been assigned his wife more 
precisely she had made it hers since sacramento reagan began 
his political career as governor of california 
presidential power was first published in 1960 and has been 
updated several times the new edition entitled presidential 
power and the modern presidents is scheduled for publication 
oct 29 by the free press a division of macmillan inc neustadt 
is a professor emeritus at the john f kennedy school of 
government harvard university 
neustadt says the irancontra episode will not dominate the 
history of the reagan administration because reagan recovered from 
it nevertheless he says it is a textbook case of a president 
failing to guard his prospective influence and making himself 
vulnerable to personal misjudgments and dubious advice 
the crucial issue of the presidents use of prospective 
influence lies in wait for every incumbent writes neustadt 
bush cannot escape it any more than reagan could but possibly to 
see it with an irancontra sharpness is to see it plainer than 
before that might conduce to dealing with it better better at 
least than in my judgment reagan did 
 
editors note w dale nelson covered the white house for the 
associated press throughout president reagans second term

a bacterial infection that may be as serious as 
toxic shock syndrome is on the rise and is targeting children as 
well as adults researchers reported tuesday 
new research points to significant changes in the pattern of 
severe streptococcal infections dr charles hoge of the us 
centers for disease control reported tuesday at an american society 
for microbiology conference 
strep is a common microbe most frequently thought of as the 
cause of strep throat but in rare cases it can cause extremely 
serious infections such as the pneumonia that killed muppets 
creator jim henson in may 
three years ago researchers began to talk of toxic shock 
syndrome caused by streptococcal infections not the staph bacteria 
implicated in the muchpublicized illness linked to tampon use 
now researchers from the cdc and in pima county ariz have 
studied 128 cases of groupa streptococcal infections in 10 
hospitals in the tucson area to determine the prevalence of the 
most severe cases 
the study involved records between january 1985 and march 1990 
fiftyfour cases occurred from 1985 to 1987 none of those met a 
series of conditions similar to toxic shock syndrome low blood 
pressure rash peeling skin multiorgan involvement but six of 
the 74 infections studied from 1988 to 1990 did 
one of those six patients died hoge said for all the countys 
severe groupa strep infection patients the death rate was 20 
percent 
laboratory tests on the bacterial isolates from pima county 
found a propensity toward production of a specific toxin and that 
toxin was present in at least two of the six toxicshocklike 
cases toxic shock syndrome gets its name from the toxins produced 
by the bacteria at fault 
the exact case definition of strep toxic shock is yet to be 
determined but based on the cluster of symptoms in the arizona 
study and the laboratory findings that toxin may be the culprit 
hoge said 
while the study was limited to the one populous county the 
pattern is clear hoge said streptococcal toxic shock syndrome was 
significantly more likely to occur after 1988 
more studies are needed to characterize the exact toxins present 
in the arizona cases which would provide more clues as to the 
exact nature of the illnesses hoge said but he and his colleagues 
reported that changes in the strains of the strep bacteria may be 
responsible for the changing seriousness of strep infections 
as in hensons case severe strep complications have been seen 
most frequently in adults 
but three of the arizona cases occurred in children and other 
researchers at the conference reported new outbreaks of serious 
strep infections in children 
doctors at childrens mercy hospital in kansas city mo 
reported that eight of their 29 cases of groupa strep infections 
between 197190 had the pattern of feverish illness tender skin 
multisystem involvement reminiscent of toxic shock 
syndrome 
one of the eight cases occurred earlier this year and three 
more this year have followed the study we have not had four 
children previously in one year with multisystemic streptococcal 
syndrome said dr mary anne jackson 
and doctors at dalhousie university in halifax nova scotia 
reported 16 such cases over a 10year period 
that remains rare given hundreds of strep cultures a year in a 
large hospital said dr scott halperin an associate professor at 
dalhousie 
but for 16 kids its an important issue tremendously 
important he said and as a scientific issue we wonder why 
the organism has had changes in its pathogenesis over time 
neither the kansas city study nor the halifax study included 
specific toxin tests 
but it certainly is a multisystemic disease jackson said 
were trying to draw the attention of clinicians to this entity 
tell them to think of this 
when groupa strep infections proceed to the bloodstream the 
fatality rate is 20 percent to 30 percent strep was once the 
frequent cause of serious illnesses such as scarlet fever and 
rheumatic fever but the most dangerous strains for the most part 
faded from view around the 1940s 
henson was the most famous recent victim of streptococcal 
illness he died of a severe and rapidly spreading pneumonia

preliminary tests of cotton plants genetically 
engineered to kill bugs themselves have been encouraging the 
agriculture department said tuesday 
the departments agricultural research service this summer 
conducted the first field tests of the cotton plants developed by 
monsanto co of st louis mo 
test plants called transgenic were inserted with a gene from a 
different organism bacillus thuringiensis or bt a commercially 
available natural bacterium 
the gene enables bt to make a protein toxic to many caterpillar 
species and the transgenic plants make a similar protein 
department scientists said the transgenic plants caused 
caterpillars to have a fatal case of indigestion often after 
eating only a bite or two of the leaves or bolls 
the engineered cotton plants still must undergo extensive 
testing but officials said the new technology could help reduce 
the use of chemical pesticides reducing production costs for 
cotton farmers

employee morale at rocky flats nuclear 
weapons plant has fallen because of the plants chronic problems 
and now many workers have an indifferent attitude that jeopardizes 
safety a psychological report says 
a rocky flats spokesman said plant officials disagreed with some 
of the reports conclusions but acknowledged that there has been 
turmoil among the work force because of a large number of recently 
hired employees 
the report said continuing criticism from the media community 
groups and friends have made employees fearful of declaring that 
they work here many have reported feeling embarrassed to mention 
to people that they are employed at rocky flats 
the aug 30 report is from jn thistel administrator of the 
employee assistance program to fj furman director of the 
plants occupational health department thistel wrote that sweeping 
changes have had an intense impact on employees and that the 
problems are causing employees severe stress at home and on the 
job 
sources at the plant provided copies of the report to the 
associated press on condition they not be identified 
thistel said the problems have taken a toll on employees and 
interviews with the plant psychologist have skyrocketed from a 
low of 22 facetoface interviews for the month of march to a high 
of 145 in august 
particularly in the last three years change at the plant has 
been prolonged arduous and capricious thistel warned 
consequently employee morale has suffered because individuals 
no longer know what is expected of them why the changes are 
occurring and are unable to have the time to recuperate before 
another crisis confronts them he wrote 
this eventually causes employees to simply wear out and go 
into a survival mode by adopting an indifferent attitude he 
added 
the report helps show that serious problems continue to plague 
the denverarea plant which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons 
a consulting firm cermak fletcher associates inc of 
gaithersburg md has done a study for egampg inc the plant 
contractor citing serious management problems at the plant during 
the last five months 
that report released monday by plant officials said egampg 
relied too heavily on the us department of energy to identify 
problems at the plant it also said upper management failed to 
develop a comprehensive plan for restarting the plant 
operations at the plant have been suspended since november 1989 
because of safety and environmental concerns 
in june 1989 fbi and environmental protection agency 
investigators raided the plant looking for evidence of improper 
disposal of hazardous wastes a federal grand jury was convened in 
august 1989 to investigate but has not issued any indictments 
thistel acknowledges that workers attitudes pose potential 
safety problems he said employees are getting mixed messages to 
restore the plant to safe operating conditions and to complete work 
quickly so the plant can resume operations 
this has been reported to have placed many supervisors at odds 
with employees with the supervisors pushing workers to meet 
deadlines and the workers complaining that they are being asked to 
perform operations that arent safe thistel wrote 
francis allhoff assistant general manager for administration 
and planning said egampgs top management disagreed with some of 
thistels conclusions especially that workers are being pushed to 
resume operations at the cost of safety 
any push we have has to do with safety improvements not 
towards resumption he said 
but he said management is having a problem conveying that idea 
to workers 
the report said staff members are suffering from burnout because 
of overuse and underuse of personnel 
while on one hand we have people working massive amounts of 
overtime many without adequate compensation on the other we have 
highly qualified people that have nothing to do the latter is 
closely akin to a prison environment where individuals are 
punished by sensory deprivation he wrote 
allhoff acknowledged that there were some delays in getting 
workers to their assigned jobs because it could take up to a year 
for new employees to get security clearances he said more than 
1100 employees have been hired during the past year 
he said other jobs are being found for people to do in the 
meantime and any delays in putting them to work are temporary

the armybacked caretaker government 
made a lastditch attempt tuesday to stem the sympathy wave that 
many feel puts benazir bhutto within striking distance of returning 
to power 
as the ballot boxes were being readied the caretaker government 
filed a seventh corruption charge against the 37yearold former 
prime minister before a special onejudge tribunal in the eastern 
city of lahore 
president ghulam ishaq khan used his constitutional powers on 
aug 6 to oust ms bhutto and install a handpicked caretaker 
government comprised of her most outspoken critics 
the latest charge alleges ms bhutto abused her power by making 
illegal appointments in some 10000 government jobs a hearing was 
set for nov 5 
later tuesday the president issued a blistering speech on 
nationwide tv and radio in which he recounted the charges against 
ms bhutto and her former administration 
he urged the estimated 50 million eligible voters not reelect 
her party when they vote wednesday 
you need not fear anyone but god almighty for his fear alone 
will give you courage to make the right decision said the 
73yearold bureaucrat and stalwart of pakistans last military 
dictator gen mohammad zia ulhaq 
ishaq khan was once considered the standardbearer of pakistans 
infant democracy but that image has been largely tarnished by the 
special tribunals set up to try ms bhutto and her government 
more than 100000 soldiers in full combat gear fanned out across 
the country tuesday to prevent what many have predicted will be 
pakistans most violent election 
at stake in wednesdays poll are 217 seats in the national 
assembly the lawmaking lower house of parliament that will choose 
pakistans next prime minister polls open at 800 am local time 
11 pm edt and close at 500 pm 800 am edt 
ms bhuttos populist pakistan peoples party and three smaller 
allied parties are pitted against the islamic democratic alliance 
a looseknit coalition of 18 parties with little in common but 
contempt for ms bhutto 
most analysts say the election is too close to call but her 
opponents insist the peoples party will win no more than 75 seats 
far from an outright majority 
despite a host of economic and social problems wednesdays poll 
is seen as a referendum on the dismissal of ms bhuttos popularly 
elected government after only 20 months in power and on the future 
course of a democracy struggling to emerge for the past 43 years 
even before the first votes were cast ms bhuttos loyalists 
were accusing the caretaker government of cheating they said the 
tactics included moving polling stations impounding vehicles 
designated to take ms bhuttos ssupporters to vote and buying 
identity cards from the poor her support base 
the allegations being made are not unique said ken wollack 
executive vice president of the washingtonbased national 
democratic institute the group sent 40 international poll watchers 
from 18 countries to monitor the election 
their assessment could determine whether pakistan continues to 
receive hundreds of millions of dollars in crucial economic and 
military assistance nawaz sharif ms bhuttos chief nemesis and 
leader of the islamic democratic alliance dismissed the 
allegations 
shes trying to project the idea of rigged elections because 
she is preparing the ground for defeat said sharif considered 
the leading contender for prime minister if the alliance forms the 
next government 
when ishaq khan fired ms bhutto he alleged her largely 
inexperienced government had plundered the national treasury and 
used government funds to buy political favors 
he said it had handed out government jobs to friends and their 
families and failed to curb lawlessness and ethnic violence in ms 
bhuttos home province of sindh 
ms bhutto has insisted her government was clean and competent 
in an effort to politically destroy ms bhutto the caretaker 
government dragged her and a halfdozen former cabinet ministers 
before special tribunals dismissed across the board as kangaroo 
courts 
but instead of discrediting her leftleaning party the 
caretaker government only helped unify the leadership and 
rankandfile and halt ms bhuttos declining popularity 
the caretaker government then arrested her flamboyant and 
controversial husband asif ali zardari a 38yearold karachi 
businessman blamed for much of ms bhuttos troubles 
zardari was arrested oct 10 and held without bail in the april 
kidnapping of a pakistaniborn british citizen and extortion of 
800000 
zardari has used his arrest as a badge of honor and portrayed 
himself in newspaper advertisements as a martyr for democracy he 
also is a candidate for two seats in parliament

the house voted tuesday to spend 193 billion 
this fiscal year to operate the commerce justice and state 
departments including more money for savings and loan prosecutions 
and the drug war 
the legislation approved 37740 contains provisions agreed to 
in negotiations with the senate to comply with deficitreduction 
requirements and to compromise differences between the two 
chambers versions of the bill 
before sending the measure to the senate however the house 
discarded senate language accepted by house negotiators that 
would have required the us trade representative to wait five 
years after leaving the government before accepting a private 
sector job representing a foreign country 
opponents of that provision said it was inappropriate in an 
appropriations bill 
the total spending in the bill is 529 million less than the 
amount appropriated for the three departments last year and 681 
million less than requested by president bush 
the bill calls for 85 billion for the justice department 
including 105 million in various divisions for savings and loan 
investigations 
money specifically for activities related to sampl crimes 
includes 
47 million in the fbi budget 
45 million in the budget for us attorneys 
6 million in the budget for the justice departments criminal 
division 
5 million in the budget for the civil division 
3 million in the budget for the tax division 
the bill appropriates 694 million for the drug enforcement 
administration 146 million more than last year but 6 million 
less than requested by the president 
it also earmarks 328 million for interagency law enforcement 
efforts against organized drug crime an increase of 113 million 
over last year but 2 million less than requested by bush 
japaneseamericans who were put in prison camps in the united 
states during world war ii would get 500 million nearly 50 years 
after the internment congress voted last year to make the 
payments 
the state department section of the bill includes 788 million 
to cover overdue us payments for membership in the united nations 
and its affiliate international organizations 
the appropriation reflects bushs plan to bring the united 
states up to date in dues payments in recognition of the united 
nations work in gathering international support for action against 
iraqi president saddam husseins invasion of kuwait 
the united states is five years behind in payments the 
appropriation in the bill covers full 1991 membership in the 
organizations and 20 percent of the back payments 
another provision in the bill prohibits export licenses to ship 
supercomputers to any country helping iraq improve its warfare 
capabilities or whose nationals are helping iraq improve its 
military operations

a multinational group of doctors hoping to prevent 
a war in the middle east wants to sail a hospital ship into the 
region to provide free medical care a spokesman said tuesday 
were writing to world leaders in hopes that the ancient 
responsibility we have as physicians to prevent war could be 
realized said edward g toomey an internist at emerson hospital 
in concord mass were just hoping that something will come of 
it 
the baltimorebased physicians group life international has 
also planned a meeting in geneva on nov 2 to show solidarity 
against a possible war in the persian gulf 
the organization first had planned to use the former navy ship 
the sanctuary as a roaming medical facility for third world 
nations but iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 changed its 
priorities 
we plan to go to one place and stay long enough to make a 
major difference in the way medical care is delivered and affect 
the quality of life of people said bob mead life 
internationals executive director ideally wed like to have 
the ship be in some place for a year and a half or two years and 
do some medical training as well 
two navy hospital ships are already in the persian gulf toomey 
said 
the sanctuary first sailed after world war ii when it brought 
american war prisoners home from japan it was also used in the 
korean and vietnam wars 
life international tried for two decades to buy the ship and

minister of iran who was captured by iraqi forces early in the 
198088 iraniraq war committed suicide two years later 
the official iraqi news agency said its information came from an 
official source who was commenting on press reports that iraq 
was still holding former cabinet member mohammad javad tondguyan 
ina monitored in nicosia did not say exactly when or how he 
died 
the agency said president turgut ozal of turkey then prime 
minister sought to gain tondguyans release on march 22 1986 
during a visit to baghdad and that iraqi president saddam hussein 
told him tondguyan had committed suicide 
on monday iran accused iraq of holding tondguyan in a secret 
prison and demanded his immediate release 
irans official islamic republic news agency said iran had 
live and documented evidence tondguyan was alive and that iraq 
should show good will by releasing him at once 
tondguyan was captured while on a tour of the fronts in october 
1980 a month after the iraniraq war broke out a ceasefire ended 
hostilities in august 1988 
saddam recently agreed to irans terms for a formal peace 
settlement of their border dispute as he tried to break out of the 
international isolation that followed his aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
saddam subsequently withdrew his troops from sections of iranian 
territory occupied during the conflict the two persian gulf 
neighbors also have exchanged tens of thousands of prisoners of 
war 
the iraqi agency said iraq formally informed iran of tondguyans 
suicide through the international committee of the red cross it 
said iraq also handed over to iran all papers related to the 
investigation a medical report and a death certificate in 
accordance with provisions of the 1949 geneva convention

attorney morris dees is two for two in 
multimilliondollar court battles against racists making him enemy 
no 1 of violent white supremacists in the united states 
im sure for the time being anyway that these guys see me 
as the problem they ought to be looking at themselves dees 52 
said tuesday 
a state jury late monday awarded 125 million to relatives of a 
black man beaten to death by racist skinheads giving dees a 
big victory over white aryan resistance leader tom metzger 
three years ago dees won a 7 million verdict against the 
united klans of america after two klansmen from mobile ala 
killed a 19yearold black man 
i think this verdict is much more important than the one 
against the united klan for the lynching of michael donald because 
that klan group was on the decline said dees head of the 
southern poverty law center in montgomery ala 
this is an ascending group its gaining membership gaining 
power dealing with the young aggressive violentprone segment of 
society the skinheads 
dees said steps will be taken immediately to attach the assets 
of metzger a 52yearold television repairman from fallbrook 
calif 
defendants in the latest case included metzger his son john 
kenneth mieske and kyle brewster mieske and brewster are portland 
skinheads who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the death of 
mulugeta seraw 27 an ethiopian man who was attacked with a 
baseball bat in november 1988 
the portland jury agreed 111 that the metzgers sent agents to 
the city to organize skinheads and incite them to commit violence 
against minorities 
metzger who represented himself in court contended that his 
activities were protected by free speech provisions of the 
constitution 
an attorney for the american civil liberties union michael 
simon said his group had no problem with the verdict 
in light of the findings that there was an intentional 
incitement which is not protected by the first amendment there is 
no threat to first amendment liberties by holding a defendant 
liable for the consequence of his actions simon said 
the rev richard butler pastor of the church of jesus 
christchristian aryan nations in hayden lake idaho said the 
monetary verdict will help the white supremacist movement by 
serving as a wakeup call 
i think its terrible he said its theft its actually 
the theft of his property the theft of his business and everything 
else theyre going to steal all the property they can of every 
white man 
metzger said after the verdict he was prepared to do whatever 
was necessary for the white racist cause 
my wife and i made a pact in 1971 when we went against the 
vietnam war and quit paying taxes that if we had to leave our home 
in fallbrook california with only the clothes on our back so be 
it metzger said 
the judgment assessed metzger 5 million the white aryan 
resistance 3 million john metzger 1 million and mieske and 
brewster 500000 apiece jurors also awarded 2 million in 
noneconomic damages and 500000 for loss of income to be divided 
equally among the five defendants 
elden rosenthal a portland attorney who had jewish relatives 
die in german concentration camps helped represent the seraw 
family he praised the work of ancer haggerty the black multnomah 
county circuit judge who presided over the civil trial 
he called this right down the middle rosenthal said he 
did not let his personal biases influence the way he handled 
himself in this courtroom 
dees who has an autobiography a season for justice coming 
out in april said he has no other big cases looming 
but he doesnt think the country has heard the last from 
metzger 
i dont think theres any question that metzger has been 
driven up against the wall dees said i think he sincerely 
believes the things that his paranoid mind tells him about how the 
aryan race is doomed to be consumed by the mud people as he 
calls them and that he sees some holy grail purpose to stop this 
from happening 
if a man is willing to die for his race what else would he be 
willing to do for his race

rightwing leader jeanmarie le pen said tuesday 
his party has been invited to iraq to discuss hostages and he would 
personally accompany french citizens home if they are freed under a 
plan by saddam hussein 
the iraqi national assembly earlier tuesday overwhelmingly 
endorsed the iraqi presidents proposal to release all french 
nationals held in iraq and kuwait 
le pen who has urged expulsion of moslem immigrants in france 
has been highly critical of frances role in the multinational 
force amassed following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait he began 
private contacts with baghdad to seek a peaceful solution to the 
conflict 
there have been no reports of when or if french hostages could 
be released about 330 french citizens are held in iraq or kuwait 
including 67 at strategic sites as a deterrent against military 
attack according to the french foreign ministry 
saddam made the proposal to free french hostages monday in 
appreciation to liberal french peoples rejection of us 
policies toward iraq and in support of president francois 
mitterrands desire for a peaceful resolution to the gulf crisis 
the official iraqi news agency reported 
a statement from le pens national front party indicated a 
highlevel party delegation would shortly leave for iraq at the 
invitation of iraqi authorities 
a national front delegation will occupy itself first of 
all with the fate of the french who find themselves there as well 
as the other europeans le pen told the french television network 
la cinq 
but le pen said he will only go to iraq if all the hostages are 
freed 
iraqis french ambassador abdul razzak rachid alhachimi refused 
to confirm whether the delegation would take home hostages 
we prefer and we hope that a french government official will 
go to baghdad to bring the french nationals back thats for 
sure alhachimi said in a la cinq interview 
hubert vedrine a spokesman for mitterrand declined comment on 
the iraqi decision the iraqi assembly endorsed saddams 
hostagerelease proposal in a 2482 vote iraqi officials said 
earlier tuesday premier michel rocard and some legislators held 
a meeting dedicated to the french hostages 
bernard stasi a centrist member of the national assembly 
quoted rocard as saying the release would be a unilateral 
decision taken by iraq 
the taking of hostages is odious the foreign ministry said 
in a communique their release is no more than an atonement for 
an unacceptable act france cannot accept any sort of negotiation 
on the subject 
but the ministry said france would take measures to repatriate 
the hostages if they are freed 
saddams proposal has been viewed as an attempt to split the 
wests antiiraq alliance by creating the impression that france 
was negotiating its own deal 
france with 13000 troops deployed in the gulf region 
represents the second largest western military force after the 
united states

on the anniversary of the east blocs 
bloodiest uprising hungarys leaders on tuesday urged their 
countrymen to fight fear of the future in the spirit of their 
battle against soviet tanks 34 years ago 
commemorations of the 1956 revolt were modest compared to last 
year when they were combined with other events marking hungarys 
transition to democracy 
economic worries and political disenchantment have spread since 
then budapest wreathlaying ceremonies that attracted thousands 
last year drww hundreds tuesday 
speakers at a ceremonial meeting of parliament drew parallels 
between disenchantment now and that which followed crushing of the 
uprising by soviet armor 
today when the country is living through difficult hours 
when hungary is not only suffering from its legacy but new pains 
and disappointments let us remember 1956 prime minister 
jozsef antall told the assembly 
he asked all parties to fight poverty and keep the germ of 
apathy from contaminating our people 
antall and other dignitaries later placed wreaths at the grave 
site of revolutionary premier imre nagy and associates executed 
after the failed uprising 
vytautas landsbergis president of the independenceminded 
soviet republic of lithuania and a guest of hungarian federation of 
political prisoners suggested lithuanians emulate the 1956 
struggle 
he said it served as an example to his republic as it seeks to 
break away from the soviet union 
fiftysix served as a very good example for our cause he 
told state radio if we want to be free we have to do the same as 
what you did in 56 
it was not clear what landsbergis meant by the statement which 
was carried in voicedover hungarian translation on the radio 
lithuanias attempt to regain its independence has been almost 
totally peaceful in later comments he emphasized that lithuania 
was using only nonviolent means 
daylong commemorative rallies were arranged as well as a march 
retracing the steps of the 200000 demonstrators who gathered 34 
years ago 
the revolt began on oct 23 1956 with student demonstrations 
calling for greater democracy a multiparty system and withdrawal 
of soviet troops protests grew into armed clashes with hungarian 
secret police and soviet troops before soviet tanks suppressed all 
resistance 12 days later 
official figures put the dead at 5000 to 6000 with 12000 
wounded western estimates said up to 32000 people died and 
200000 fled the country 
last year their spirits lifted with the prospects of 
approaching democracy more than 100000 people marked the uprising 
with an emotional torchlight rally less than six months later 
hungarians elected a free government that pledged to replace the 
sovietstyle centralized economy with a free market system 
in the last two years most demands voiced by the 1956 
demonstrators have been fulfilled including withdrawal of all 
soviet troops now in progress free elections freedom of 
expression and economic reforms 
but spirits this year were dampened by worrisome economic 
indicators that include a debt of more than 20 billion and 
mounting unemployment 
i work as an accountant and i can tell you that my firms 
situation is shaky indeed almost hopeless karoly 
petrovics a 27yearold father of two told a reporter 
i just dont know how i am going to keep the family going next 
year still the anniversary evoked strong emotions from some 
people 
a ceremony outside the national radio building the site of 1956 
fighting was briefly disrupted when about 20 men forced their way 
into the lobby 
they demanded removal of a black marble plaque set up by the 
former communist government in memory of secret police officers who 
died defending the station against revolutionaries 
the men withdrew after a cloth was placed over the plaque

amnesty international on wednesday reported a 
significant upsurge in the number of killings by armysupported 
death squads this year in el salvador 
the londonbased human rights group reported more people were 
killed in the first seven months of 1990 than in all of last year 
between january and early august 45 people had reportedly been 
killed by death squads forty were reportedly killed by death 
squads in 1989 it said 
amnesty said killings torture and disappearances have 
continued despite a un agreement on human rights signed july 26 
by the government of president alfredo cristiani and the guerrilla 
group farabundo marti national liberation front fmln 
bodies of victims have been found mutilated some with their 
faces completely destroyed and others with signs of having been 
brutally tortured victims have been shot dead on the streets or in 
their homes the amnesty report said 
the nobel peace prizewinning group detailed several killings 
including an agricultural cooperative member slain aug 1 at work 
and a union member who was taken from his home by two men in 
civilian clothes july 23 his body was found the following day 
amnesty said its information on the death squad killings came 
from former members of the security forces among other sources 
amnesty said its sources and other information including 
testimonies by former members of the military suggests that those 
responsible for these actions death squad killings are linked to 
the armed forces 
it said four apparent death squad killings that occurred in the 
days following the un accord suggest that those responsible are 
continuing to operate with the confidence that they will not be 
punished 
amnesty said cristianis government had acknowledged reforms 
were needed and that the security forces sometimes committed 
excesses but the government has denied involvement 
however the extent and nature of the abuses and the fact that 
human rights violations have been committed with almost total 
impunity under this and previous government has left little doubt 
of official complicity amnesty said 
the rights organization said it was also concerned about reports 
of rights abuses linked to the fmln 
the report on el salvador is based on findings by amnesty 
delegates who visited the country in april 
the report contains 34 recommendations including making full 
investigations into violations strengthening the office of the 
attorney general and ensuring its independence and protection for 
judges and witnesses involved in human rights cases 
about 72000 people have been killed in the 11yearold civil 
war between the government and the fmln 
the two sides began ceasefire talks in may and are scheduled to 
meet nov 4 in mexico 
after the un agreement the government spoke out publicly 
against torture and established rights training courses amnesty 
said the government revised detention guidelines and established a 
24hour office to provide information on detainees the report 
said

albania published a draft election law 
tuesday that for the first time permits secret ballots and multiple 
candidacies but albania the lone defender of stalinism in europe 
would remain a oneparty state 
the communistcontrolled legislature will discuss the measure in 
november 
the draft allows several candidates to contest each of 
parliaments 250 seats and permits a broader range of official 
organizations to propose candidates than in the past 
besides the ruling albanian labor party communist party the 
communistrun democratic front the youth organization and trade 
unions also could field candidates 
no date for elections has been set 
the draft which appeared on the front page tuesday of the party 
daily zeri i popullit was publicly outlined oct 9 its 
publication seemed timed to coincide with the arrival of 
journalists and diplomats for a meeting of balkan foreign 
ministers the first such highlevel international here in decades 
following east europes anticommunist revolutions albania has 
been taking steps this year to modify its hardline communist 
system and has emerged from its selfimposed international 
isolation 
coupled with a lack of freedom albanias 3 million citizens 
endure the lowest living standards in europe 
last july discontent led an estimated 4000 albanians to 
besiege embassies in tirana before being allowed to emigrate 
the public show of unrest was unprecedented but president ramiz 
alia has kept to his line of cautious reform opening up the 
economy for the first time to foreign investment and allowing some 
albanians to travel abroad 
a legal expert who met with journalists tuesday made clear 
however that albanias communist hierarchy is not considering 
following other east european leaders in abandoning oneparty rule 
there wont be any party pluralism said aleks luarasi 
deputy dean of tirana universitys political science faculty 
there will be pluralism of opinion the people are free to 
express their opinions in the mass organizations in the party and 
in other ways but there wont be any party pluralism 
luarasi said parliament will appoint a committee to oversee 
reform of the constitution and that he expected further legal 
changes 
one such change will concern religious practice outlawed under 
communist albanias founder enver hoxha who ruled from 1944 until 
his death in 1985 
religious matter was dropped last may from a list of activities 
deemed antistate propaganda luarasi said albanians now can gather 
undisturbed at holy places however churches and mosques have not 
been reopened 
traditionally roughly 70 percent of albanians were moslems 20 
percent orthodox and 10 percent roman catholic 
luarasi noted that laws guaranteeing free operation of religious 
institutions in addition to freedom of belief probably would have 
to be passed if albania wants to realize its goal of joining the 
conference on security and cooperation in europe 
albania was the only european nation that did not sign the 1975 
helsinki accord also known as the final act that launched the 
conference as a body stipulating and monitoring human rights in 
europe

a federal appeals court tuesday invalidated a 
federal communications commission decision that allows american 
telephone amp telegraph co to discount longdistance packages for 
large corporations 
the us circuit court of appeals here held that the fcc did not 
fully examine whether the customized longdistance services atampt 
offers its larger corporate clients violated the communications 
act 
the appellate court ordered the fcc to review its 1989 decision 
on the socalled tariff 12 services offered by atampt whose 
longdistance operations are subject to government regulation 
atampt started offering the longdistance packages to companies 
such as general electric co ford motor co and dupont in 1988 
the service packages enable large companies to hire atampt to set 
up an integrated longdistance network to transmit voice data and 
visual communications and manage the system 
the tariffs filed with the fcc for each service contain the 
specifications that atampt provided the customer during contract 
negotiations 
several of atampts longdistance competitors including mci 
telecommunications inc and us sprint argued that these tariffs 
violated the communications act because they were so narrowly 
tailored that the services were not generally available to all 
potential customers 
the threejudge appellate panel held that the fcc used 
impermissible criteria in determining whether a package of services 
offered to one large corporate customer was different from an 
aggregate of the same longdistance options sold individually to 
other customers 
the fcc must also determine if there is a neutral rational 
basis for the price differences between the two sets of services 
the court said 
the fccs 1989 order gives us no confidence that this analysis 
has yet been done the court said in an opinion by circuit judge 
laurence silberman that was joined by judges abner mikva and harry 
edwards 
we have the impression that there is a certain air of 
unreality about this case silberman wrote the fcc one way or 
another will undoubtedly permit atampt to compete effectively 
against its competitors in the large user market if that is what is 
really involved here 
but we are obliged to insist that it do so by turning square 
corners of administrative law silberman wrote 
mci spokesman john houser said the courts ruling put in legal 
limbo tariff 12 arrangements that the company contends are 
anticompetitive and unlawful 
but atampt spokesman herb linnen said the telecommunications giant 
was confident that issues raised by the courts opinion can be 
easily remedied by the fcc 
the decision today doesnt in any measure pull the plug on 
customers that atampt is now servicing and we are confident that the 
concerns raised by the court can be easily remedied by the 
commission linnen said we will continue to offer these 
services to existing and prospective customers 
fcc general counsel robert l pettit said in a statement that 
the fcc would carefully study the ruling and consider atampt tariff 
12 filings now pending in light of the courts opinion

king fahd on tuesday said saddam 
hussein would not lose face if iraq withdrew from kuwait and 
egyptian president hosni mubarak expressed hope the persian gulf 
crisis would end without bloodshed 
the remarks taken together with earlier comments by defense 
minister prince sultan appeared to be the most conciliatory 
message to the iraqi president since his troops invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 
but saudi arabia also said prince sultan was misquoted and 
denied it wants kuwait to yield territory to iraq to defuse the 
crisis those reports helped push oil prices down more than 5 a 
barrel monday 
the saudis said again tuesday that saddam must withdraw his 
troops from kuwait unconditionally 
i do not see that if a blunder were committed that we correct 
the mistake with another mistake the correct reply is to remedy 
the mistake fahd told reporters in remarks distributed by the 
official saudi press agency 
it would be nothing to cause anxiety or pain but to the 
contrary if president saddam thought seriously about the matter he 
would find that it is in the interest of iraq in his personal 
interest and in the interest of the arab nation that he pull out 
from kuwait 
losing face is considered a major dishonor in arab culture arab 
conflicts traditionally are handed over to a mediator trusted by 
both sides if both sides accept his decision face can be 
preserved 
apart from early efforts by king hussein of jordan no such 
mediator has emerged so far 
mubarak visited saudi arabia to meet with some of his 14000 
troops deployed at the northeastern region of hafr albatin and 
told them their presence was meant to force him who lost his 
reason to return to it 
he expressed egypts hope the crisis end without bloodshed or 
war 
mubarak then traveled to the united arab emirates to meet with 
officials there and check on a 2000strong egyptian force based 
185 miles from abu dhabi the emirates capital 
addressing his soldiers mubarak cautioned against a settlement 
that does not provide for reinstating kuwaits deposed alsabah 
family 
emirates president sheik zayed bin sultan alnahyan who 
accompanied mubarak said he hoped the issue would be settled soon 
either by peace or by war 
rejecting conciliatory statements zayed said the emir of 
kuwait sheik jaber alahmed alsabah must be reinstated 
is it our duty to save an aggressors face zayed said 
no he put himself in an awkward situation and he must get out of 
it

piece they flow gently around the body in a medley of flower 
prints or solid bright crepe de chines sometimes sashed at a low 
hip above a narrow hem 
add to this floaty new shirtjackets flounced babydoll and 
trapeze dresses in airy fabrics fullsleeved vnecked print or 
silk crepe blouses cut like gypsy shirts 
even the fitted suits or dresses with easy jackets look softer 
the luscious pastel plaid jackets paired with flowered outfits 
underneath are great fun as are belted blouse and skirt outfits 
lame print dresses with low waists and flounced hems flowered 
shifts under multicolored striped blazers flared evening dresses 
with full tulle crinolines peeping underneath and sensational 
fringed taffeta stoles complete the festive ungaro line 
the fashion words elsewhere were also easy and soft guy

bold jacquard pastille dots flowers or striped prints 
the wearable classics included short and boxy coats or long 
shirtjackets cashmere trench coats in navy or hot pink and 
doublebreasted coat dresses in soft poplin wool 
some good bicolor poplin shirtwaist dresses with drawstrings at 
hemlines or hips in shades like poppy and grey or khaki green were 
typical of the casual dressing advocated at laroche 
casual beachwear included bright ethnic prints long white 
wrapped skirts and plenty of shorts one striking outfit was topped 
by a large blackandwhite diamondprinted silk twill shirtjacket 
best in the dressier line here were a couple of sequined minis 
topped by a draped bustier top and raw silk shirtjacket in hot 
shades of gold fuchsia and rust or combinations of blue and green 
philip wagon the new englishborn readytowear designer for 
nina ricci showed a line sometimes so soft it almost went limp 
there were plenty of long and floaty shirt jackets slim pants 
and shirtdresses often in white or ivory fluid fabrics and pique 
wagon also opted for his version of the flowery blouson look 
it was all in good taste from the bicolored navyandwhite 
crepe dress cut to look like a white blouse with a dark apron to 
the flounced crepe de chine the sacks tent dresses and shifts 
a typical simple shift in deep turquoise had slightly puffy 
cuffed long sleeves big buttoneddown patch pockets and was worn

defense minister moshe arens on tuesday 
barred palestinians in the occupied territories from traveling to 
israel following a series of revenge attacks by jews and arabs 
under arens order the 17 million palestinian residents of the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip will be banned from entering 
israel beginning wednesday morning the military command said 
those staying in israel where many work were ordered to return 
home 
israel television said the travel ban will remain in effect for 
several days until tensions are reduced 
the army usually erects barriers on main roads leading to the 
territories to enforce such orders 
the last closure of the occupied areas in response to violence 
was after the may 20 slaying of seven arabs by a jewish civilian 
near tel aviv the territories also have been blocked in recent 
years during the jewish yom kippur or the day of atonement 
holiday 
arens order was issued hours after israeli civilians fired on 
an arab car in the southern negev desert killing one palestinian 
laborer and wounding his three cousins 
doctors at nasser hospital in the gaza strip town of khan yunis 
identified the victim as maher al shaher 30 one of the ounded 
was in serious condition with a gunshot to the back they said 
palestinian reporters said the four were returning from work in 
israel when they came under fire from a red jeep in the area of 
mivtahim near gaza 
the army confirmed the palestinians were apparently shot by 
jewish civilians and said the attack was being investigated 
earlier tuesday a west bank palestinian knifed two unarmed 
women soldiers and another arab bludgeoned two israelis with a 
hammer 
the knifewielding arab was chased and captured by soldiers and 
civilians police said there were reports he was beaten and 
hospital officials said he was in critical condition with head 
injuries 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said the recent wave of attacks on 
israelis which began sunday with three stabbing deaths in 
jerusalem resulted from unusual hysterical incitement of 
arabs 
tension has risen since oct 8 when police fired on 
stonethrowing palestinians at jerusalems hallowed temple mount 
killing at least 19 arabs 
clandestine leaflets have urged arabs to step up attacks on 
jews and the violence since sundays killings raised fears that 
the 34month palestinian uprising may be entering a more dangerous 
phase 
a leaflet distributed tuesday by hamas a moslem fundamentalist 
group praised as a hero the palestinian laborer who killed an 
unarmed woman soldier a gardener and an offduty policeman sunday 
in jerusalem 
it said the laborer had killed three enemy soldiers and 
added this is only the beginning 
the daily yedioth ahronoth reported a rush by israelis on gun 
shops and reporters pressed shamir to say what his government was 
doing to protect the public 
shamir said security was being increased in all parts of the 
country but he insisted the violence would die down in a matter 
of days 
tuesdays trouble began at about 930 am when an arab shouting 
allahu akbar god is great stabbed two women soldiers 
hitchhiking near kiryat tivon in northern israel 
naama yekutiel a youth instructor was in serious condition 
with a punctured lung said dr albert suttinger deputy director 
of rambam hospital in haifa 
the other cpl limor benshaul suffered a superficial back 
wound suttinger said 
radio reports said several citizens helped capture the 
assailant 
we chased him and then he threw down the knife and we grabbed 
him civilian eli koman told israel radio we held him down and 
shouted at the soldiers to shoot and kill him they wouldnt i 
asked one of them to give me his rifle he refused 
an unidentified civilian speaking on israel television said he 
participated in a beating of the alleged attacker 
he shouted ai ai and we began beating him we kicked him 
we tried to beat him as hard as possible said the man 
offduty bus driver albert benezra told army radio that he 
pursued the assailant and exchanged punches with him 
i saw him throw the knife and then i grabbed him then i heard 
shots fired in the air and the soldiers came and helped me said 
the bus driver who added that he has two daughters in the army 
the suspect was identified as a 39yearold palestinian from the 
west bank town of jenin where a 14yearold boy was killed and 
eight other people injured in a clash with soldiers monday 
he was taken to afula hospital in central israel and then to 
rambam where suttinger said he was in critical condition 
later tuesday in the southern coastal city of ashkelon an arab 
wielding an 11pound hammer battered two israelis in their 40s as 
they worked in a machine shop police said 
both were hospitalized and details of their conition were not 
immediately available the 23yearold arab who worked at the 
shop was arrested police said they said he claimed to be 
avenging a friend who was killed in gaza 
the attacks came as police blocked arabs from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip from entering jerusalem for a second day in an 
effort to prevent violence between arabs and jews 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said tension in his city was 
decreasing but would not disappear until negotiations begin on 
peace when no progress is seen or any small light at the end 
of the tunnel there is despair 
also tuesday two palestinian men were found dead in the gaza 
strip town of rafah after being shot by fellow arabs for allegedly 
collaborating with israel arab reports said 
police were investigating the deaths 
internal feuding has killed 286 palestinians since the uprising 
began in december 1987 most were accused of collaboration 
at least 763 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians and 51 israelis have died in the violence

humphrey the wandering whale freed from 
one spot in the mudflats of san francisco bay spent most of 
tuesday stuck in another spot before he began wandering again 
five years after the 40foot humpbacks much publicized voyage 
through the bay to the sacramento river he drew a crowd of 
thousands to a cove near candlestick park where he lay beached by 
rocks bearing a no trespassing sign 
a team of marine biologists veterinarians and the coast guard 
nudged the 45ton whale with their hands splashed him with buckets 
of water towed him with a harness and used an air compressor to 
suck mud from below him 
essentially we were trying to tease him off that mud rock 
frank griffith of the california marine mammal center said during 
the effort theres no amount of human beings that you could put 
out there to push him off like youd push a car down the street if 
hes stuck on the bottom by mud suction you couldnt move him 
unless he puts some effort into moving himself 
as afternoon high tide rolled in humphrey budged a bit from the 
mud at 220 pm flipping his fins raising his tail and blowing 
water through his spout the crowd cheered 
a short while later humphrey got stuck again but with more 
work he freed himself and swam out into the bay while volunteers 
banged pipes to direct him away from land 
once humphrey reached deep water a quarter to a half mile away 
rescuers hoped to used recorded whale sounds to lure him out under 
the golden gate bridge to the ocean where he belongs 
i think the guy likes attention i think he likes people 
said frank boyd of san francisco who was in the crowd watching 
humphrey 
humphrey became something of an aquatic celebrity in the fall of 
1985 when he spent 25 days swimming in san francisco bay and the 
sacramento river delta before being guided and cajoled back to the 
pacific 
his legions of fans heralded him with songs poems books and 
of course a tshirt the state and federal governments spent 
50000 on the effort to coax him out to sea 
biologists recognize humphrey through tail markings with a 
unique pattern like a fingerprint theyve spotted him in the 
ocean near san francisco every year since in august or september 
nearly 200 children from five grades in the nearby bret harte 
elementary school walked out to the edge of the bay tuesday to 
watch humphrey 
we are studying about whales said mrs swaraj gujral a 
fifthgrade teacher the children are very worried they wonder 
how he can survive they said we should all get together and push 
him i think he likes it here he went away but he left his heart 
in san francisco 
efforts to move him using boards and a tow rope during the early 
morning high tide failed for most of the day humphreys 
whitestriped dorsal hump poked only about three feet above the 
surface while his head and tail remained under water 
the fact is the animal didnt help us at all said denize 
springer spokeswoman for the marine mammal center in 1985 when 
he was stuck then he helped us 
humphrey beached himself twice monday the first time 
blundering onto mud flats near candlestick park snarling traffic 
for hours as commuters slowed to gawk the mammal finally floated 
off on a rising tide but then worked himself into a real jam when 
he became stranded again north of the stadium 
he was completely out of the water as the tide went out monday 
night and again after sunrise volunteers from the marine mammal 
center then worked to keep him from becoming dehydrated 
another fear springer said was that the whales weight would 
crush vital organs 
hes literally lying on his lungs she said 
springer said a blood test taken monday and completed early this 
morning showed nothing abnormal about humphreys condition other 
than he has been under stress and hadnt eaten 
although humpback whales arent known to attack humans the 
volunteers trying to help the stranded mammal face the danger of 
being hit by the whales strong fluke or tail which could cause 
serious injury or death 
those keeping watch included sharnel jackson 14 who recalled 
the whales first visit 
we had a big banner in class with humphreys name on it she 
said as she lifted the collar of her jacket to ward off the cold 
i know humphrey i want to see him get free

published tuesday that he is willing to help gain the release of 
seven journalists recently kidnapped by drug traffickers if the 
government grants him the right to move about the country 
in the last two months officials say the medellin cartel has 
abducted seven journalists including diana turbay the daughter of 
a former president and francisco santos news editor of colombias 
leading newspaper el tiempo 
also kidnapped is marina montoya sister of colombias 
ambassador to canada german montoya montoyas son was kidnapped 
by the cartel earlier this year but was freed after church leaders 
appealed for his release 
jorge luis ochoas letter was a response to an appeal by ramiro 
andrade former colombian ambassador to spain andrade who helped 
ochoa avoid extradition from spain to the united states in 1986 
asked ochoa to mediate in the kidnapping crisis 
observers say the cartel abducted the journalists to pressure 
the government to grant drug traffickers a pardon

the government presented a parliament 
reform bill tuesday that makes it easier for parties to achieve a 
majority of seats but presents obstacles for small political 
groups 
under the proposal parties must secure at least 3 percent of 
the vote in national elections to be represented in 300member 
singlechamber parliament advocates say the minimum requirement 
would force small groups to unite under one banner 
the plan would also reduce the requirement to form a government 
to 43 percent of the vote presently a party needs at least 47 
percent for a majority 
the proposal presented to parliament on tuesday is expected to 
be hotly debated before it comes up for a vote nov 8 
the present proportional representation law was adopted prior to 
the june 1989 general elections by the thenruling panhellenic 
socialist movement 
greeks have gone to the polls three times the past 16 months for 
national elections after parties failed to achieve the 47 percent 
majority 
in april the conservative new democracy party won 4688 percent 
of the vote but it gained a oneseat majority after it was joined

communistruled serbia largest of 
the nations six republics all but abolished yugoslavias internal 
common market tuesday by imposing duties on goods from 
reformminded slovenia and croatia 
measures approved by serbias parliament undermined the liberal 
economic reforms of federal prime minister ante markovic and 
appeared to push the troubled balkan nation one step closer to 
political disintegration 
prime minister stanko radmilovic said his 15point economic 
program would protect serbias economy from disloyal domestic and 
foreign competition and from markovics destructive policies 
it imposes duties on serbias foreign imports and on goods from 
the western republics of slovenia and croatia where centerright 
governments replaced communists after free elections this year 
radmilovic said croatia and slovenia yugoslavias most 
developed regions could no longer count on free access to the 
serbian market 
goods from the two republics are more expensive but generally of 
higher quality than serbianmade goods 
deputies passed seven points of the program tuesday including 
the one imposing import tariffs the other points will be voted on 
later 
no details were available on the size of the duties 
croatia and slovenia seek greater independence by transforming 
yugoslavia into a loose confederation and applying for european 
community membership they would keep the common yugoslav market 
however where most of their products are sold 
serbia remains communist with elections set for december its 
government wants power to remain in belgrade the federal and 
serbian capital 
under radmilovics program serbia no longer will sell raw 
materials and electricity at subsidized prices to slovenia and 
croatia 
serbia also would ban or impose heavy taxes on many foreign 
goods to protect its own producers serbia has refused to 
eliminate some key price controls and close down moneylosing 
enterprises 
serbian parliament spokesman ivan cumic said tuesdays vote was 
virtually unanimous but refused to give specifics 
markovic a croatian technocrat has opened yugoslavias borders 
to cheap foreign goods hoping to force home firms to lower their 
prices and raise productivity to compete 
radmilovic slammed markovics privatization plans and 
tightmoney policies saying they harmed serbias economy 
he acknowledged some of his program conflicted with federal 
laws but said that was justified to keep serbia on par with 
slovenia and croatia 
markovic prime minister since march 1988 introduced reforms 
last december that have throttled runaway inflation and pulled 
yugoslavia from the brink of bankruptcy

unprofitable firms that threatens to push up unemployment already 
a hefty 19 percent 
initial optimism that markovics popularity could overcome the

prosecutors tuesday portrayed ramon 
salcido as a calculating killer who stepped over the bodies of his 
motherinlaw and her daughters to find a bandage for a finger he 
cut during a wine country rampage that left seven dead 
in closing arguments defense attorney marteen miller conceded 
that salcido killed the seven including his wife and two children 
but claimed salcido was crazed and incapable of planning the 
murders 
if convicted of firstdegree murder salcido faces the death 
penalty the jury was scheduled to begin deliberations wednesday 
the trial began sept 14 
salcido 29 is being tried in san mateo superior court for the 
april 14 1989 murder of his wife angela two of his daughters 
his motherinlaw and her two daughters and a coworker at the 
grand cru winery he also faces three counts of attempted murder 
for attacks on a third daughter another coworker and the 
coworkers wife 
prosecutor peter bumerts disputed the defense contention that 
anger and drugs sparked the rage and that salcido was suicidal 
here is a man who wants to kill himself stepping over dead 
bodies to get to a bandage to bandage his finger which he cut 
while killing people bumerts said 
investigators say a trail of blood from salcidos cut finger 
indicated he stepped over the bodies of his motherinlaw marian 
richards 47 and her daughters ruth 12 and marie 8 after 
fatally slashing them 
blood was found on a box of bandages in the richards house and 
salcido was wearing a bandage on his finger when he was arrested in 
his native mexico four days after the slayings in sonoma county 
the prosecution said 
the trial was moved here because of extensive pretrial media 
coverage bumerts maintained salcido was lucid when he earlier 
killed his wife and slashed the throats of his daughters at a dump 
and said he then pondered killing more of his family 
before he even leaves the dump hes thinking about his next 
victims bumerts said he produced a photo of the dump saying 
that is hell that is not heaven 
the prosecution said that while being returned to california 
salcido said in a taped statement that he was angry with his wife 
because she had married him while pregnant with another mans 
child he said he was angry at his motherinlaw for not telling 
him about the childs parentage and angry at his supervisor because 
he thought the man tried to have him fired 
miller said salcido showed up at the richards home with no 
intention of killing the woman and her two girls he went there 
with no idea in the world to do anything to those children 
miller said 
miller suggested that someone can be psychotic and kill in an 
organized fashion someone can be crazy as a toad negotiate 
their way into a courtroom wait for the judge and kill him 
miller said 
he said salcido was an atypical mexican immigrant who did not 
socialize much with other mexicans was at odds with himself 
and was overwhelmed by financial and legal problems 
jurors he said should put aside their fears of being called 
baby killers at cocktail parties and ignore what he described 
as people whispering you shouldve sent him to the gas chamber 
miller asked jurors to convict salcido of less than firstdegree 
murder seconddegree murder carries a basic penalty of 15 years to 
life while terms for manslaughter can range from two to 11 years

the 1968 prague spring revolt succeeded in the end

against the sovietled warsaw pact tanks in 1968 
they told us wed lost but we didnt lose the proof is that 
i now stand here said dubcek now the countrys assembly leader 
we decided then not to use weapons if we had resisted maybe the 
peace in all europe would have been threatened

riksdag swedens parliament the chamber was not full but dubcek 
received two standing ovations from those who attended 
after the speech he flew to norway where he was to meet

strong federation in czechoslovakia and believes the countrys 
ethnic problems can be resolved through democratic principles it 
will be hard work he said

development and economic reform was through a market system that 
includes privatizing most of the state sector and open the economy 
to foreign investment and joint ventures

a president who shows up at a fundraiser 
for a freshman congressman usually hears his praises sung in 
accolades that would do justice to a canonization 
but when rep peter smith brought on president bush tuesday as 
the guest of honor after the 125aplate apple pancakes the 
lawmaker took pains to emphasize his specific disagreements 
with bush on civil rights and deficit reduction 
it may have been the most halfhearted introduction bush has 
heard in 21 months as president and it dramatized the discomfort 
many republicans feel with the taxraising deficitlowering deal 
bush hopes to nail down with the leaders of congress 
something unusual also happened at bushs next campaign stop in 
manchester nh for another gop congressman named smith bo 
smith who is running for the senate 
bob smith skipped his own fundraising event sending his wife 
mary jo instead to introduce the president she said her husband 
stayed in washington because of key votes pending in the house 
back in washington an aide said smith prides himself on his 
nearperfect attendance record and wanted to be on hand to support 
the president in any attempt to override his controversial veto of 
the civil rights bill the aide asked not to be identified 
peter smith is a former college president trying to hang onto 
his seat against a tough challenge from independent bernard 
sanders the iconoclastic socialist exmayor of burlington 
he is a man of independent mind i wish hed stop reminding me 
that we do have a few differences out there remarked bush 
but hey listen nobody is going to do it exactly my way 
there are 435 of these people in the united states congress 
smith unlike most republicans voted for the original 
controversial budget deal that bush and the leaders struck last 
month then turned around and voted with the house democrats on an 
alternative raising taxes steeply on the rich sanders has skewered 
him for both 
my specific disagreements with this administration are a 
matter of record most recently on the civil rights bill but 
also some of the elements of our deficit reduction said smith 
let me just tell you mr president i think the people of 
vermont are ready and willing to support higher taxes on the 
wealthy as an important part of any package to get this country out 
of deficit said smith 
smith said bush had run on and won on a pledge not to raise 
taxes but agreed to do it because he understood that the good of 
this country had to come first 
bush has seen his own personal popularity rating plummet amid 
his turnaround on taxes and the budget stalemate of the past month 
with two weeks until election day republicans are worried that 
bushs problems could jeopardize their chances 
on a rainy dismal day bush also was campaigning in waterbury 
conn for gary franks a black republican congressional candidate 
and in stamford conn for the partys gubernatorial candidate 
rep john rowland 
the fundraiser for franks was closed at a 500 a plate dinner 
for rowland bush drew applause when he noted the republicans 
promise not to impose a state income tax on connecticut residents 
although the president seemed put out by the lukewarm 
introduction in burlington he praised peter smith as a congressman 
who votes his conscience and puts the good of the country 
first 
when he voted for the early compromise it wasnt an easy 
vote said bush he knew he was going to get sniped at from 
people way on the right or way on the left i perhaps in a 
different perspective had to do exactly the same thing 
were hanging tough for a good agreement bush assured the 
crowd of 700 vermont republicans some of whom paid up to 500 to 
have their pictures taken with the president the event was 
expected to net 40000 to 50000 for smiths campaign 
the days of tax and spend and damn the deficit must come to an 
end declared bush 
he also made a spirited defense of his stand in the persian gulf 
against iraqs occupation of kuwait 
seventyfive antiwar demonstrators stood in the rain outside 
the conference hall in burlington to decry bushs policies with 
banners reading talks not troops and no war for natural 
resources 
i saw some signs coming in here today no war for oil i can 
understand the sentiment by some of those young people he said 
but he said the united staes and its allies were standing up 
for morality against saddam hussein whom he likened to hitler 
the holding of hostages innocent men and women goes 
against the conscience of the entire world said bush the 
starving of embassies good god this is 1990 these are 
crimes against humanity there can never be compromise any 
compromise with this kind of aggression 
it isnt oil that we are concerned about it is aggression and 
this aggression is not going to stand declared bush 
it was peter smith who led the crowd then in giving bush a 
standing ovation

preparations for local elections were at a 
standstill tuesday after the us supreme court intervened in a 
thirdparty ballot dispute in the hotly contested gubernatorial 
contest 
at issue was whether the allblack slate of county candidates 
from the harold washington party named for the citys first black 
mayor should be included on the ballot washington died in 1987 
justice john paul stevens on monday halted further printing and 
distribution of ballots in cook county saying the full supreme 
court should hear the dispute most of the ballots already have 
been printed without the washington party candidates 
the supreme court was expected to consider stevens action 
friday and possibly hear the washington partys challenge to an 
illinois supreme court ruling keeping its candidates off the 
ballot 
the illinois supreme court ruled oct 12 that washington party 
candidates werent entitled to appear on the ballot because they 
didnt have enough nominating petitions 
the legal challenge was filed by five petitioners who 
washington party officials contend acted for the county democratic 
party 
it was not immediately clear if county or state elections would 
be postponed if the high court rules in the washington partys 
favor 
city and county election officials said it would be nearly 
impossible to retool election ballots and computers to include the 
third partys slate of 19 county candidates within two weeks 
cook county republican party chairman richard seibel said the 
urgency of the election is in question voters dont know if its 
going to be november 6 or december 6 at this point

prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
tuesday the influx of soviet jews means israel no longer needs to 
fear being submerged by a growing arab population 
in a speech to latin american immigrants shamir said the debate 
in the jewish state over the demographic issue which was very 
widespread and disturbed many people had vanished in recent 
months 
many among us took masochistic pleasure in playing with the 
comparative numbers of jews and arabs and searched the statistics 
for the date on which the number of arabs would equal and perhaps 
exceed the number of jews he said 
and wonder of wonders lately this sport is disappearing no 
one will miss it 
in a few years we will not recognize the land of israel 
everything will have changed society the economy the culture 
he said 
our people will grow it will fill our little country with 
jews and thus the country will be bigger in content human 
strength potential 
speaking from a prepared text shamir was careful not to suggest 
his government might violate its undertakings to friendly 
governments and send the soviet jews to live in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
but shamir boasted the soviet influx had handed his nationalist 
doctrine a victory over those who have argued that both for the 
sake of peace and for demographic reasons israel should give up 
the occupied territories with their 17 million arab inhabitants 
i remember the days not long ago when arguments such as 
these were heard in public debate if i knew that the gates of 
russia would open and hundreds of thousands of jews would come out 
i would think differently about the problem of the borders of the 
land of israel he said 
and now the gates have opened and the immigration flows and 
those voices and those arguments are no longer heard 
israeli officials say they expect 1 million soviet jews to come 
here by 1992 the countrys population is 47 million of whom 39 
million are jewish and 800000 are arab 
shamir added that the soviet exodus used to be the most talked 
about issue in the arab political world 
today he said you hardly hear any of them talk about it 
they have realized that they cannot persuade their great ally the 
soviet union to shut the gates russia wont shut the gates and 
they the arabs have accepted that that is the way the world 
goes 
shamir said the soviet union was no longer the arabs major 
military backer we are grateful to the nations of the soviet 
union and their leaders for this turning point he said we 
wont forget it

a hospital has appointed a committee to 
investigate the death of a hearttransplant patient whose blood 
type was listed incorrectly in a transplant matching computer 
we arent pointing a finger at anyone dr robert emery 
director of heart transplantation for abbot northwestern hospital 
and the minneapolis heart institute said monday 
the 47yearold patient who had type o blood received a heart 
from a type a donor because his blood type was erroneously listed 
as type a 
he died when his body rejected the heart 
the survival rate is more than 60 percent when hearts from type 
a donors are transplanted into type o patients that survival rate 
jumps almost to 100 percent when hearts from type o donors are 
transplanted into type o patients emery said 
the patient whose name was withheld suffered from 
cardiomyopathy deterioration of the heart muscle and from lung 
and kidney problems 
the bloodtype mixup was discovered shortly after the 
transplant doctors controlled the mismatch with antirejection 
drugs for about seven days before the patients body rejected the 
heart emery said 
abbott northwestern officials rechecked the blood type 
classifications for all patients on its transplant waiting list and 
no other errors were found emery said

bp oil corp agreed tuesday to pay 23 
million for dumping waste from its marcus hook refinery into the 
delaware river federal authorities said 
the fine part of a legal settlement was the second largest the 
government has ever assessed for water pollution federal officials 
said us steel was fined 29 million in 1977 for pollution from 
its plant in gary ind 
i think youll see a trend toward increases in the size of 
fines for water pollution predicted cynthia giles an assistant 
regional counsel for the environmental protection agency 
the government sued bp oil under the clean water act in 1986 
prompting the company to replace its wastewater treatment plant 
with a new 25 million plant which began operating last year 
bp oils old plant was discharging excess oil and grease 
ammonia solids sulfides and various chemicals that reduced the 
amount of oxygen in the water changed its acidity and sickened and 
killed fish authorities said 
the company violated its wastewater discharge permit 6500 times 
from 1979 until the present said the epa all the charges 
concerned the old plant 
discharges from the bp oil plant were a major contributor to 
the pollution problem in the river the epa said 
the refinery is on the river about 2 miles north of the delaware 
state border it produces gasoline jet fuel diesel oil and other 
petroleum products 
joann elser bp oils human resources manager said the new 
plant was operating at 996 percent efficiency 
weve been here a long time were firmly entrenched in the 
community she said were concerned about the quality of water 
going into the river 
the settlement includes the 109000 bp oil already has paid the 
state of pennsylvania to settle a separate suit by the department 
of environmental resources

young women are as safe from sexual assault 
at the nations only training center for female navy recruits as 
they are anywhere in society the base commander said tuesday 
we have nothing to hide rear admiral louise c wilmot said 
at a news conference she was responding to news reports about 24 
allegations of rape sexual assault and fraternization at the naval 
training center in orlando over the past 18 months 
the sex crimes and fraternization problems at the base had been 
previously reported but navy officials in washington recently made 
copies of internal investigative records available to reporters 
the navys inspector general suggested that navy investigators 
of sex crimes are inadequately trained he indicated that more 
female investigators should be assigned to the orlando training 
center 
the report said base officials had failed to seek appropriate 
punishment for offenders 
we just reject that out of hand wilmot said there is 
a lot of misinformation out about that inspector generals 
report we helped write that report 
six rape cases never went to trial because of insufficient 
evidence wilmot told reporters but 13 cases of fraternization and 
five of sexual assault were prosecuted and the offenders punished 
the six reported rape cases arent a large percentage in a 
command where 15000 women were trained during that time the 
admiral sad 
we can assure young women and their parents that they have 
nothing to fear at this base she said 
three of the alleged rapes were reported on the base and three 
outside she said and none involved instructors or officers 
each case was investigated but none was prosecuted for lack of 
sufficient evidence 
the admiral said that in some cases there were problems with the 
credibility of the witnesses in others excessive alcohol was 
involved and we have had cases where people have made false 
accusations of rape 
she personally reviewed all the decisions against bringing cases 
to trial and they were then reviewed by higher authorities in 
washington and no one disagrees with us the admiral said 
in the wake of the report the base is creating a centralized 
computer list of all such allegations and crimes expanding a 
rapeawareness course for recruits conducting seminars and 
strengthening other counseling and assistance programs for women 
she said 
the training center has seven major commands each headed by a 
captain 
if anything theyre very protective about the female members 
of their command the admiral said i stand for equal treatment 
for men and women 
the navy has strict fraternization rules and the base prohibits 
any social contact between trainingcompany commanders who are 
usually noncommissioned officers and female students this applies 
even when the recruits finish training and are transferred 
violators are subject to nonjudicial punishment and are usually 
fined removed from their positions and transferred out of orlando 
with some 18000 navy and civilian employees the training 
center is the orlando areas second largest employer next to walt 
disney world it has an annual payroll of 300 million

democratic congressional leaders said tuesday 
they will reserve the right to call lawmakers back into session if 
needed for any emergency in the persian gulf 
the leaders also are establishing a smaller group that will be 
available to consult with president bush on the middle east as a 
way of maintaining the role congress claims in the exercise of war 
powers 
a joint statement by house speaker thomas foley dwash and 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine noted that 
presidential consultation with congress is required by law under 
certain circumstances 
we believe that regular consultation is necessary and useful 
particularly given recent developments in the persian gulf 
normally once congress adjourns for the year it can be recalled 
only by the president but this years adjournment resolution 
expected later this week will provide that power to the top 
democrat in each chamber as well in consultation with the house

the us department of agriculture and 
the alamance district attorney are investigating animal cruelty 
allegations involving a biological supply firm officials said 
tuesday 
abc news reported monday that carolina biological supply co has 
been killing nearly 200 cats a week with poison gas to be sold for 
science education or research the report said customers were told 
that all of the cats had been killed at animal shelters 
the investigations were prompted by complaints by people for the 
ethical treatment of animals and began prior to the abc report 
officials said 
cats have been killed at the companys gas chamber but not by 
carolina biological company spokesman ron field said tuesday 
licensed animal dealers were allowed to use carolina 
biologicals chamber to kill animals in the past but field said 
that practice was recently halted 
for a number of years the company has openly permitted 
federally licensed animal collectors to use the companys 
euthanasia chamber understanding that the practice was approved by 
the usda animals were put to sleep by collectors and purchased by 
the company only after the animals were sacrificed field said 
district attorney steve balog said his investigation should be 
completed in a week or so 
usda regional animal care division supervisor joe walker 
contacted at his office in tampa fla told the burlington 
timesnews that inspectors on his staff began an investigation of 
carolina biological supply co earlier this year 
we wont have any comment on the investigation until it is 
completed walker said 
carolina biological is one of the worlds largest suppliers of 
animals for scientific research 
just recently the usda said that if we wish to allow live cats 
on our property in the future we would have to modify these 
procedures he added instead we decided not to allow dealers 
to use our facilities any longer and as a consequence now permit 
only euthanized cats on its property 
field said carolina biological supply has never bought live 
cats 
the allegations made last night on abcs world news tonight 
against carolina biological supply co are unfair distortions of 
the companys practices in dealing with animal specimens which have 
been taken out of context to suggest cruel treatment of animals 
field said 
the abc report included videotape shot by people for the ethical 
treatment of animals showing live cats being pushed into a gas 
chamber and an unidentified former employee saying overcrowding in 
the chambers sometimes meant some cats did not die immediately

a church leader on tuesday urged former 
dictator jose efrain rios montt banned from running in the 
presidential race to retract accusations the government plans to 
cheat in the nov 11 national elections 
otherwise archbishop prospero penados del barrio warned at a 
news conference this could destabilize guatemala and lead to a 
military coup against outgoing president vinicio cerezo 
cerezos government denied rios montts allegations as did a 
representative for the military 
in the name of peace i ask that gen efrain rios desist 
from his attitude which is polarizing our people and causing 
confrontation and this can lead to destabilization and a coup 
penados said 
rios montt has been resisting a constitutional provision barring 
him as a candidate because he became president through a military 
coup 7 years ago 
speaking at a political rally last weekend in chiquimula 104 
miles east of guatemala city rios montt accused cerezo of planning 
to fix the elections in favor alfonso cabrera hidalgo the 
presidential nominee of cerezos centrist christian democrats 
rios montt also urged his supporters to fight the ban by writing 
in his name on ballots to show that it is you who want me in 
power by law this would automatically invalidate the ballot 
and enough invalid ballots could scuttle the elections 
this could cause confrontations because his call for 
resistance is not as passive as it seems penados said he is 
being pigheaded he has run the legal course from the supreme 
electoral tribunal the supreme court and the constitutional court 
with negative results for his aspirations 
a bornagain protestant rios montt claims he was robbed of 
victory when he ran for president on the christian democratic 
ticket in 1974 with the election fixed to put conservative gen 
eugenio kjell laugerud in power 
in march 1983 he headed a junta of three officers that 
overthrew laugeruds successor president fernando romeo lucas 
garcia an elected army general but three months later he forced 
out the other two generals and stayed on as president 
while in power rios montt built up his image as an 
administrator who was equally tough on common criminals and leftist 
guerrillas he had more than a dozen suspected rebel leaders 
summarily executed by firing squads ignoring an appeal from pope 
john paul ii to spare their lives 
rios montt was overthrown in 1983 by a military coup led by gen 
oscar humberto mejia victores who then had an elected convention 
reform the constitution and called elections which cerezo won in 
1984 
cerezo completes his fiveyear term jan 14 the first civilian 
elected president in 17 years in a country convulsed by a 
threedecadeold leftist guerrilla insurrection all the rest have 
been military men 
he rios montt has been dead politically since aug 8 1983 
when i relieved him of power on the decision of the army high 
command mejia victores told reporters tuesday 
rios montt who broke with the christian democrats has been 
trying to run at the head of a ticket by a threeparty conservative 
coalition in public opinion polls he was leading 12 other 
candidates on a lawandorder platform that was appealing to 
guatemalans tired of a threeyear crime wave 
presidential spokesman carlos anleu reiterated government 
promises that the elections will be free and clean 
on nov 11 guatemalans will also vote for a new legislature 
municipal authorities representatives to a central american 
parliament that will soon be formed by guatemala honduras costa 
rica el salvador and nicaragua 
if none of the candidates get a majority of halfplus one of the 
votes cast for president the two top contenders will go into a 
runoff

the house passed and sent to president bush a 
bill that would ban the use of largescale drift nets in us 
waters up to 200 miles offshore and their use by american fishing 
fleets anywhere in the world 
on a voice vote the house dropped its own version of the 
legislation and agreed to adopt a bill approved earlier this month 
by the senate that also would require bush to seek an international 
ban on driftnet fishing 
the nets which can extend up to 40 miles around have been 
blamed for the deaths of thousands of dolphins other sea mammals 
and birds caught in their paths as they are dragged through the 
water to trap commercial fish 
the bill expands the 1976 magnuson fishery and conservation act 
to include previously exempted tuna in government controls over 
commercial and sport fishing within 200 miles of the us 
coastline 
the legislation also requires the government to develop 
standards that tuna canners would have to adopt in order to label 
their product dolphin safe 
some companies according to lawmakers have adopted the 
dolphin safe label in response to boycotts by environmentalists 
even though they continue to purchase tuna known to have been 
caught in nets responsible for dolphin deaths

an 8yearold new york boy afflicted with 
brain tumors got his wish thursday he finally met president bush 
jimmy kilanowski of lake ronkonkoma on new yorks long island 
was in the front row of the audience with his parents at a 
republican fundraiser where bush was speaking 
bush had invited the family after reading news accounts that 
jimmys hopes of meeting him had been frustrated by a bureacratic 
snarl at the white house 
after bushs speech for connecticut gop gubernatorial candidate 
john rowland bush hugged the boy who put his arms around the 
presidents neck and whispered something to him 
when the president left the boy turned to his parents and said 
he still cares 
the white house invited the kilanowski family to come to the 
event because it was relatively close to their new york home 
jimmy was given a year and a half to live in april 1989 because 
of the brain tumors 
he had expressed his desire to meet bush through a local 
organization which grants wishes to terminally ill children 
however the white house initially denied the request 
apparently on the grounds that the request had not been made 
through the proper channels 
bush himself decided to see the boy after reading a news account 
in the new york post suggesting that he was too busy to see the ill 
child said white house spokeswoman alixe glen

a judge tuesday ordered penthouse magazine and 
its publisher robert guccione to pay 406 million to a former pet 
of the year who charged that he used her as a virtual sex slave 
state judge elliott wilk ruled that guccione made sexual demands 
on marjorie thoreson as a condition of employment at penthouse 
where she worked from 1973 to 1980 
sexual slavery was not part of her job description wilk 
said 
gucciones cold and calculating use of sexual coercion 
forced her to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body 
which is a violation of state law wilk said 
thoreson now 37 sued guccione for 10 million alleging breach 
of contract sexual harassment and fraud 
she testified during the march 1989 trial that guccione forced 
her to perform hardcore sex acts in a pornographic movie and used 
her sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a hotelcasino he 
owned in atlantic city 
she said guccione also ordered her to carry on a sex affair with 
his financial adviser so he would move from england to the united 
states she said she severed the relationship because it appeared 
the adviser was going to leave his wife and four children 
her attorney murray schwartz said the ruling is for all the 
women like her who may have suffered at the hands of guccione he 
has finally been held accountable 
penthouse lawyer jeffrey daichman labeled thoreson a liar and 
said an appeal was expected the ruling read more like a 
political manifesto about the womens movement than an objective 
analysis of the evidence he said 
guccione said in a statement that penthouse presented evidence 
to the judge showing that thoreson was a former prostitute 
drugabuser and threetime felon who had violated her probation 
he said thoresen allegedly began an affair with the financial 
adviser at a time when she was not even employed by penthouse 
at the trial guccione testified that thoreson was a potential 
marilyn monroe whom he had rescued from a life of crime 
the judge who heard the case with no jury said gucciones only 
evidence to contradict thoreson was his word and added i do not 
believe him 
wilk awarded thoreson 4 million in punitive damages and 60000 
in compensatory damages the amounts were based on gucciones 150 
million personal worth and penthouses market value of about 200 
million he said 
thoreson a native of st paul minn was working as a topless 
dancer and a cocktail waitress in california in 1973 when she sent 
guccione nude photos and asked if he could help her become an 
actress 
guccione began by signing her to a personal management contract 
and changing her name to anika di lorenzo he made her penthouse 
pet of the year in 1975 and invited her to move into his new york 
townhouse which she did 
in 1976 guccione cast her in his sexually explicit movie 
caligula which thoreson now says was a pornographic film that 
ruined her career for her role guccione paid for surgery to have 
her breasts enlarged 
guccione testified during the trial that he cast her in caligula 
because she was sexually and perfect for the part 
i thought it was a legup on prostitution in las vegas 
stealing cars writing bum checks and building up a life of 
crime he said referring to her checkered past 
thoreson sued guccione after he fired her in 1980 because she 
refused to accompany him on a trip to the far east she said she 
feared he would pass her around to the businessmen he was meeting

fliers threatening the lives of jewish children 
here in retaliation for the slayings of palestinians have been 
turned up in brooklyn and police are trying to calm worried 
parents 
investigators are unsure if the threat is in earnest and of how 
many of the fliers actually were distributed 
in light of whats been happening in jerusalem we have to 
take this seriously said deputy police chief kenneth gussman a 
ranking police commander in the borough of brooklyn 
a 25officer task force will focus on six precincts with 
sizeable jewish populations in brooklyn gussman said and visit 
every yeshiva jewish school ask them if they have received a 
copy of the flier alert them to the fact the flier had been found 
and assure them of increased police attention to ally their 
fears 
the investigators also are seeking the writer of the flier 
which is signed moslem from new york and bears a photo of a 
wounded palestinian shot by israeli troops in jerusalem on temple 
mount earlier this month nineteen palestinians were killed in a 
melee that jews said began when palestinians threw stones on them 
the flier says the writer will kill jewish children beginning 
monday 
i think its a prank said rabbi bernard freilich director 
of the council of jewish organizations of boro park this does 
not look professional but theres a lot of concern due to whats 
going on in the middle east 
the flier was found on a sidewalk on oct 17 by a woman who gave 
it to a rabbi frelich said 
copies of the flier reportedly appeared in different sections of 
brooklyn but police and frelich said it was not clear whether the 
copies were being circulated by alarmed members of the jewish 
community or by others 
sixty jewish religious leaders and school administrators met 
with police officials on monday to discuss the situation

saddam hussein allowed a trickle of foreigners including 14 
americans to leave iraq on tuesday and iraqi authorities said 
all 930 french and bulgarians held in iraq and occupied kuwait will 
likely soon be released 
many have been held as part of the human shield strategy 
employed by saddam to protect against attack from multinational 
forces massed in the persian gulf since iraq overran kuwait on aug 
2 
more than 1000 americans and thousands of other foreigners 
still are denied permission to leave iraq or occupied kuwait 
said president bush im always pleased when americans might 
be released or if anybodys released but it just reminds me of 
the brutality of the policy the total brutality holding people 
against their will and parceling them out as though to look 
generous it is brutal and it is unacceptable 
the 14 americans who arrived tuesday night in amman jordan on 
a regularly scheduled iraqi airways flight from baghdad included 
two employees of the besieged us embassy in occupied kuwait and 
two sons of diplomats stranded there 
the 14 were taken to a vip lounge at queen alia airport then 
were escorted by embassy officials to an amman hotel to spend the 
night before flying wednesday morning to frankfurt germany en 
route to the united states 
a us embassy spokesman at ammans airport said the group 
included officials who worked with us government offices in 
iraq and kuwait 
the spokesman jonathan owens refused to elaborate on their 
roles when asked if the officials were diplomats from the embassy 
in kuwait he said no theyre not 
a member of the americaniraqi foundation that assisted in the 
release told reporters the group included two us embassy 
staffers who worked at the embassy in kuwait but were released 
because they are sick 
hussaini arabo refused to elaborate on their ailment or disclose 
their names and exact functions at the embassy 
arabo also said iraq will free all western hostages in return 
for international assurances that the country will not be attacked 
by usled forces assembled in saudi arabia 
president saddam will release all hostages in one hour if he 
gets guarantees from the us or from any other member of the 
un security council that there would be no offensive against 
iraq arabo said 
salim mansour head of the foundation said when we met with 
saddam we had the impression he genuinely wanted peace he wants a 
peaceful solution to the crisis mansour gave no date of their 
meeting with saddam 
five finnish men also left iraq on for home and 33 ailing or 
elderly britons were scheduled to depart with former british prime 
minister edward heath 
in stockholm sweden iraqs charge daffaires mohammed said 
hani announced tuesday night iraq will release five swedes it 
holds hostage he said more would have been freed if sweden had 
sent a higherranking official than a foreign ministry department 
chief to baghdad last week to try to secure freedom for the 90 
swedes still there 
also tuesday the iraqi parliament endorsed saddams proposal to 
allow all 330 french citizens to leave iraq saddams move was seen 
in paris as an attempt to divide the wests antiiraqi alliance 
and the french government called on iraq to free all foreign 
hostages 
the official iraqi news agency said saddam also wants to free 
all 600 bulgarians in iraq and kuwait it said he told parliament 
to vote on this issue after a meeting tuesday with visiting 
bulgarian vice president atanas semerdzhiev 
in washington meanwhile the saudi ambassador denied his 
kingdom wants kuwait to concede territory to bring about a peaceful 
settlement to the persian gulf crisis 
you cannot make aggression pay prince bandar said if you 
make aggression pay thats the law of the jungle 
he was summoned to the state department after reports quoting 
the saudi defense minister prince sultan had raised the 
possibility iraq might gain territory in return for ending its 
occupation 
prince sultan is prince bandars father 
bush speaking in waterbury conn said he adamantly opposed 
any territorial compromise and said he felt assured that was 
the position of the saudi government 
there is no give on it if you reward the man with one iota of 
territory youve rewarded aggression and that is not the position 
of the united states nor of our coalition 
none of the americans who left iraq tuesday had been part of 
saddams human shield against attack 
im just thrilled that im going william hollingsworth 64 
said in baghdad before boarding the iraqi airways flight 
its a strange coincidence but im leaving the gulf and my 
son is in saudi arabia said hollingsworth of huntsville ala 
he explained that his son is with the multinational force assembled 
after iraq invaded kuwait 
i was waiting for this moment i am extremely happy but sad 
at the same time because i am leaving many of my friends and 
colleagues said 53yearold jack fraser of santa ana calif 
another american 44yearold john thompson said he was eager 
to see his 68yearold mother in germany because she is going 
blind im her only child and she wanted to see me badly he 
said 
also leaving iraq was lloyd graham 48 who said he was going 
home to his wife three daughters and son in houston 
one evacuee identified himself as gerald scognn he said he is 
the son of an american diplomat holed up at the embassy in kuwait 
i dont know if i will see him again scognn 21 of 
fairfax va said of his father 
i am very pleased to be free but i am sad to leave behind a 
lot of very good friends he said 
i know why i was freed but id better not discuss that 
scognn said in response to a question adding i want to return 
to fairfax virginia and see my mum and my girlfriend who are very 
worried about me 
craig turlay 21 of phoenix said the situation in iraq was 
pretty monotonous 
we just stayed at the embassy headquarters and carried on as 
best as we could turlay said 
turlay was moved several weeks ago to iraq from kuwait where 
his dad also worked at the embassy he too left his father 
behind 
neither of the evacuees would identify his father by name or 
give other details no other identities of the freed americans were 
immediately available 
the americans left baghdad with a sevenmember delegation from 
the americaniraqi foundation 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of the release of 
the 14 americans we always hope that there will be more and the 
history is that when it suits him saddam he lets people go 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that of the 
14 americans six are ailing two have critically ill relatives and 
six are students she said 63 americans with health problems have 
not been allowed to leave 
prince bandar the saudi envoy spoke in washington after 
meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii 
saudi arabia has not suggested there should be concessions 
made to anyone bandar said 
his remarks were an apparent attempt to erase any impression 
that the saudi defense minister was proposing that kuwait make a 
deal with iraq 
of his fathers comments bandar said he was not implying 
kuwait should do one thing or another he was talking about what we 
have done with other countries negotiating as friends saddam did 
not choose that route 
in other developments saudi king fahd met with president hosni 
mubarak of egypt the monarch later said we would be thankful 
if iraq withdrew from kuwait 
diplomatic sources said fahd and mubarak agreed that iraqs 
withdrawal could be followed by negotiations on iraqs demand for 
territorial and financial concessions from kuwait including the 
islands of warba and bubiyan in the gulf and the kuwaiti section of 
the rumailah oilfield

imagine a mixture of father knows best 
the seven samurai and a bit of blue velvet and you may have 
some idea of what director david greenspan has done in gonza the 
lancer 
the early 18thcentury play which opened tuesday at the new 
york shakespeare festival was written by chikamatsu monzaemon who 
is often called the japanese shakespeare 
but chikamatsu might have a hard time recognizing his bloody 
tale of domestic tragedy transposed to a 1950s nevernever land 
where the characters dress like ozzie and harriet but engage in 
enough sex and violence to put david lynch to shame 
greenspan is one of three young directors given producer joseph 
papps blessing this year at the public theater they have been 
allowed to create their own seasons of plays and greenspan has 
started with this rarely produced work 
the evening starts on a wildly selfindulgent note when the 
director himself steps forward to babble a prologue he wrote in 
1982 called the long flat plane greenspan loses a good deal of 
the audience with this existential hooey about the meaning of life 
and where we are in relationship to it 
once its out of the way the play can begin theres a 
narrator here played by two different actors one for each act 
greenspan borrows freely and often to good effect from story 
theater as well as charles ludlums ridiculous theater company 
when gonza gets on a horse to ride actor koji okamura mounts a 
metal stool when the heroines little children appear they are 
dolllike puppets carried by other performers and there is some 
genderbending in the casting with several male actors playing 
female characters and women cast in mens roles 
actor tim perez looking uncomfortably like harvey fierstein in 
drag dons a babushka a floral print blouse and purple slacks to 
play a governess actress fanni green sports a mustache to portray 
a warlord 
on a mostly bare stage greenspan gets most of his laughs out of 
his props there are some amusing 1950s artifacts a pink vacuum 
sweeper being among the more interesting 
the acting is rudimentary but at least mary shultz who 
projects a marilyn monroe sultriness manages to convey some 
emotion as the doomed osai the rest of the cast seem like stick 
figures 
the productions oddness doesnt necessarily make the evening 
any more interesting in fact thats all you remember this 
version of gonza the lancer sticks in the memory more for its 
weirdness than anything greenspan and company have to say about the 
play

arkansas attorney general cheated the 
taxpayers out of more than 8000 for his own use while serving as 
the states top legal officer a prosecutor alleged tuesday at his 
theft trial 
a defense attorney responded that the state gave attorney 
general steve clark authority to use his stateissued visa credit 
card any way he pleased and so he cannot be convicted of misusing 
it 
the 43yearold democrat is charged with one count of felony 
theft by deception if convicted he could be sentenced to 20 years 
in prison and could be fined 15000 
in opening arguments prosecutor chris piazza accused clark of 
improperly billing taxpayers at least 844827 on his credit card 
for meals 56 times from 1986 to 1989 with family friends and 
political supporters 
youll see a transformation youll see a side you didnt know 
existed a transformation much like that of jekyll and hyde 
piazza said referring to author robert louis stevensons 
doublesided character 
when youre finished with this evidence i hate to tell you 
this youll see a transformation from attorney general of the 
state of arkansas to a convicted felon piazza told the jury 
which was seated monday on the opening day of the trial 
after the allegations arose in february clark reimbursed the 
state 395129 he blamed poor recordkeeping and said records of 
his meetings were reconstructed from notes his calendar receipts 
or memory every two to three months 
the allegations also forced clark to give up his candidacy for 
the democratic nomination for governor improving gov bill 
clintons reelection chances 
dozens of people clark listed on his expense account as dinner 
guests either say they didnt eat with him or they didnt discuss 
state business 
defense attorney bill bristow maintained that clark can use 
that credit card from the state of arkansas anyway he wants to if 
he wants to he can buy a car with it a house with it he is not 
forbidden by law from doing that 
you may say to steve you were sloppy you were vain you 
used bad judgment you ruined your political career but steve 
you didnt commit a crime bristow said 
bristow said clark is not the only elected official who spends 
state money for personal use 
you know who spent money on entertainment spent money for 
postage and spent money for laundry the governor bristow said 
clinton gets an allowance for the governors mansion which pays 
for food and entertainment the state receipts for 25960 in 
mansion expenses in 1989 come under the heading food bristow 
said 
clark in office since 1979 earns 26500 a year his salary is 
among the lowest among state attorneys general

indian fishermen on tuesday sued private 
contractors who ran the hanford nuclear reservation for nearly five 
decades alleging that radioactive contamination from the complex 
damaged their livelihood 
the lawsuit filed in us district court is the third class 
action that claims plutonium and uranium processing at hanford 
damaged local residents health or ability to make a living 
two similar suits were filed this summer on behalf of 
potentially thousands of people living or working downwind from 
hanford the legal actions followed a government panels conclusion 
that emissions from hanford during the 1940s and 1950s were large 
enough to cause illness to nearby residents 
a study by the centers for disease control in atlanta is 
underway to determine past effects of hanford emissions on those 
living nearby 
the latest case filed in us district court case seeks 
unspecified amounts for lost income and earning capacity 
diminished property values and property damage 
it also asks that further releases of radioactivity and toxic 
chemicals be barred and that exising radioactive and other 
contamination be cleaned up 
the seven yakima indians filing the lawsuit claim radioactivy 
and other contamination has damaged the columbia river fishery 
since the 560squaremile reservation was established during world 
war ii 
the suit said the class eventually could include more than 700 
indians who fish along the river 
the indians attorney fred sayre of santa monica calif said 
the yakimas do not fish some river areas because they fear 
radioactive contamination 
lawyers for the current main contractor westinghouse hanford 
co would not comment on the lawsuit said spokesman bill klink 
also named as defendants were several major corporations and 
their hanford subsidiaries which were hired to run reactors 
chemical plants and waste storage operations on the federal 
reservation over the past 50 years 
telephone calls placed after hours to the offices of the 
following former contractors went unanswered on tuesday ei du 
pont de nemours of wilmington del which built hanford during 
the manhattan project and operated it until 1946 general electric

liberias three warring factions met 
together for the first time in months tuesday to discuss a 
ceasefire plan for the troubled west african nation 
at the session a general in a fivenation force in liberia said 
it was safe for a caretaker government to move into the capital 
city of monrovia 
rebel leader charles taylor has for months refused to send a 
representative to the talks called by a west african regional 
mediation group taylor said his aides were in banjul only to 
listen and report back but some officials said their presence 
suggested taylor has not completely rejected negotiations 
the last attempt at a ceasefire broke down in late september 
the west african military force sent to oversee the truce later 
began attacking taylors men when they resisted relinquishing 
control of monrovia 
taylor is opposed by remnants of slain president samuel does 
forces who still hold the executive mansion in monrovia and a 
splinter rebel group led by prince johnson 
johnsons troops on sept 9 captured and killed doe who was 
visiting the headquarters of the 6000member west african force 
troops for johnson and doe have been cooperating with the 
multinational force from nigeria ghana guinea sierra leone and 
gambia 
at least 5000 civilians have died in the civil war since taylor 
invaded from ivory coast on christmas eve 
the regional force has driven taylors soldiers from morovias 
suburbs and field commander gen joshua dongonyaro of nigeria told 
the meeting the interim government could take power 
the government headed by political scientist amos sawyer was 
created by the five west african nations to rule until elections 
can be held 
taylor has opposed creation of the government saying his men 
control the majority of the country and he should be president 
taylor has set up headquarters in the central city of gbargna 
which he has declared is the countrys new capital he said he 
plans to hold elections within the year 
representatives of does remaining forces accused the regional 
forces former field commander of being responsible for the 
presidents death they claimed ghanaian lt gen arnold quainoo 
ordered does security guards disarmed when they arrived at the 
headquarters but let johnsons men keep their weapons 
johnsons soldiers slaughtered does men said gen hezekiah 
bowen who represented does forces at tuesdays meetings 
quainoo has denied any responsibility for does capture and 
death saying his men could not have intervened without breaking 
their pledge of neutrality he was replaced as field commander 
shortly after does death 
meanwhile sierra leone is reviewing its position on welcoming 
liberian refugees because of a disagreement about how many there 
are in the country 
the un high commissioner for refugees estimates there are 
60000 but the government in sierra leone says the number is more 
than three times higher

south carolina when water washed out railroad tracks causing a 
train to derail and knock down a highway overpass two automobiles 
fell into the gap left by the overpass and one motorist was 
killed 
the accident was among several caused by thunderstorms that 
doused the carolinas and spun off tornadoes rain fell through much 
of the atlantic states 
the railroad accident took place near st matthews in central 
south carolina 
flooding washed out supports under railroad tracks causing a 
freight train loaded with coal to derail said sam mccuen a state 
highway department spokesman the train hit an overpass carrying 
us highway 176 collapsing the span and sending automobiles 
plunging through the open space he said 
one man was killed and two others were injured authorities

elsewhere in south carolina strong wind and heavy rain forced 
the evacuation of 20 families from a mobile home park injured at 
least five people and flooded roads under several feet of water 
across the state authorities said 
north carolina had at least two tornadoes and record amounts of 
rain that swelled rivers to flood stage the national weather

rolled the window down but the water was coming in so fast i 
didnt think i would ever get out

the murder trial of marlon brandos 
son can begin even if brandos daughter who is the victims lover 
and a potential witness cant be brought back from tahiti 
prosecutors indicated tuesday 
the daughter cheyenne brando was at the actors mansion may 16 
when her brother christian allegedly shot and killed her tahitian 
lover 
superior court judge robert thomas ordered 255 prospective 
jurors to court nov 5 for the start of christian brandos trial 
deputy district attorney steven barshop said he is continuing to 
negotiate with french authorities for the return of miss brando 
from tahiti where she took refuge shortly after the shooting but 
the approaching trial date makes it unlikely that the complicated 
legal agreement can be reached he said 
the assistant prosecutor deputy district attorney william 
clark said the state department has been contacted about the case 
and has requested documents from the prosecution for use in 
negotiations with french authorities the authorities have been 
preventing miss brandos departure from the french colony 
miss brando 20 has been charged in tahiti as an accessory to 
the murder of her lover dag drollet 26 although he died in the 
united states the french consider his death a crime against one of 
their citizens 
we are not optimistic clark said of the prospects of miss 
brandos return the french are telling her she is not free to 
leave 
miss brando went to tahiti in june and recently gave birth to 
drollets child there 
the prosecution has a strong case even without miss brandos 
testimony clark said 
were pretty sure we know what happened that night but 
when it comes to murder thats always the hardest to prove 
clark said we would like to have cheyenne shes one of the most 
important witnesses 
clark said the key issue will be whether christian brando is 
guilty of murder or the lesser charge of manslaughter the 
defendant claims the shooting was accidental 
clark said he anticipates calling other witnesses to describe 
the events of the murder night adding he hoped the defendant would 
take the stand 
asked whether the prosecution would call marlon brando as a 
witness or leave that to the defense clark said were sure hes 
going to take the stand who calls him first is part of the 
gamesmanship

police arrested 21 people 
tuesday and recovered food and aid items believed looted by former 
indian contra rebels and others upset over worsening conditions on 
nicaraguas isolated atlantic coast 
three people were wounded in a spate of looting last week in 
puerto cabezas where friction remains strong between excontra 
rebels and sandinista loyalists on the police force 
the tension is also seen as a reflection of increasingly hard 
times in nicaraguas economy 
flooding this year destroyed many crops in the region and an 
austerity program by president violeta chamorro has meant less 
money and jobs for the atlantic coast ms chamorro defeated 
sandinista leader daniel ortega in february elections 
samuel cepeda a miskito indian who allegedly led the looting 
accused government officials of stealing donations intended for the 
indians 
cepeda is a leader of kisan for peace an umbrella group of 
three indian organizations that signed peace accords with the 
former sandinista government in 1988 
kisan seeks assistance similar to the aid given about 2300 
yatama indian rebels that demobilized last june the yatama and 
other former contras got offers of land and other help 
both kisan and yatama are made up of miskito sumo and rama 
indians who generally opposed the leftist sandinista government 
cepeda said leonel panting head of the regional government 
assured kisan it would receive part of a boatload of donations from 
managua that arrived in puerto cabezas oct 12 
they promised us a third of the cargo but we could see them 
at night stealing from the warehouses cepeda said 
about 300 kisan members and relatives raided a warehouse 
belonging to the moravian church on oct 18 as goods were being 
loaded onto trucks the looters took tools cooking oil rice 
flour and powdered milk 
five police guards fired into the air witnesses said two 
officers and a civilian were wounded by ricocheting bullets police 
said 
a day later a smaller group looted a government warehouse 
containing donated clothes police were not present at the 
incident 
puerto cabezas police chief dean dixon said the items recovered 
in the raids are a small part of what was stolen 
briceno ortega 37 one of those arrested in the predawn raids 
admitted he stole food but claimed indians sought to divert aid for 
themselves

she did it out of desperation she said shed been abandoned by her 
husband and was unable to find any one responsible to care for her 
5yearold daughter while ms fernendez worked weekends at a 
shopping mall 
her arrest saturday has focused attention on day care options as 
legislators and some state welfare officials criticized the system 
for failing poor families 
if convicted of criminal restraint ms fernandez faces a 
maximum penalty of five years in prison and 7500 fine 
according to police ms fernandez said she had kept the child 
in the car during weekends for the past month while she worked as a 
salesclerk in the fortunoff store in the woodbridge center mall 
ms fernendez reportedly told police she kept the child in the 
car after firing three babysitters because they had stolen her 
food invited guests to her home and left her daughter unattended 
roberta francis director of the division on women for the state 
department of community affairs said she disapproved of the action 
but noted ms fernendez felt she had little choice 
the mother had no other option but to do that ms francis 
said it was a catch22 society shouldnt put people into a 
catch22 situation and our reaction should not be to completely 
blame the mother for what she did 
ms fernandez who is free on 5000 bail was arrested saturday 
after police found the pajamaclad child in the trunk of a 1987 
toyota celica in the mall parking lot the child who was in good 
condition was taken into custody by the state division of youth 
and family services pending an investigation into the charges 
in a telephone interview ms fernandez said she was notified 
tuesday that she was fired from her 300aweek secretarial job at 
the central lumber management co in elizabeth

the legislation is pending

correct the issue

a sheriffs deputy was shot and critically 
wounded tuesday while hanging up campaign posters for the 
democratic opponent of cook county sheriff james ogrady police 
said 
sheriffs deputy irving bell and at least three other people 
were posting signs for alderman michael sheahan when another 
sheriffs deputy who apparently supports the republican incumbent 
emerged from a nearby bar and shouted at them to remove the signs 
said police cmdr ronnie watson 
the deputy then called inside the bar for about 10 acquaintances 
to help him and ordered one of them to kill the sheahan supporters 
watson alleged a man pulled out a gun and fired at bell hitting 
him in the back the stomach and the buttocks he said 
bell 34 was in critical condition tuesday night at christ 
hospital and medical center said hospital spokeswoman jan barnett 
his colleagues escaped unharmed 
the 3 am shooting on the south side left both candidates in 
the sheriffs race accusing each other of allowing thugs to work on 
the campaign 
ogrady contended that the wounded deputy was not putting up 
sheahan posters but was instead pulling down ogrady posters 
police were questioning an ogrady campaign worker about the 
shooting the chicago suntimes reported in its early wednesday 
editions watson said two men were being questioned but that no 
charges had been filed 
for something like this to happen to one of our workers is 
absolutely shocking sheahan said im interested in winning 
this election but im not interested in anyone getting hurt 
im asking mr ogrady to call off these people these thugs 
and goons this is the worst thing ive ever seen in politics 
ogrady said sheahan workers had provoked the confrontation by 
tearing down his campaign signs and vandalizing his campaign 
office 
this incident is the unfortunate outgrowth of a rising tide of 
streetlevel hooliganism vandalism and intimidation directed 
against our campaign by the sheahan campaign ogrady said in a 
statement 
ogrady said the sheahan supporters outside the bar are part of 
an ongoing night crew assigned to steal or damage his 
campaigns property 
ogrady said bell has been suspended from the sheriffs office 
while unrelated allegations are investigated

a sign posted on the doors of a 
halfdozen nome businesses depicts a handshake and reads in 
english and russian we accept many rubles 
the problem so far has been getting rid of them 
theres been no monetary benefit so far its like monopoly 
money said nome liquor and grocery owner greg higashi who has 
accepted more than 5000 rubles in about nine months from visitors 
from across the bering strait 
but we did it for good will not profits and were hoping 
that maybe when it does open up in russia that we can exchange them 
for merchandise or whatever 
soviet officials have said the ruble could become convertible on 
the international market within a couple of years as part of the 
nations transition to a market economy but for many nome 
merchants the pace of soviet reform has been frustratingly slow 
in the first nine months of their neighborly grassroots 
experiment in monetary exchange nome merchants have sold thousands 
of dollars in goods and services to soviet visitors 
in return they have gotten 30000 virtually worthless rubles 
they can neither spend nor invest some shopkeepers have found only 
one use for the soviet bills they sell them to american tourists 
as souvenirs 
the merchants hope that by accepting rubles they will encourage 
freer trade and travel across the bering strait forming new 
friendships and eventually new markets for alaskans 
the whole intent of the project was a goodwill public 
relations campaign to convince the soviets to make the ruble 
convertible or allow us to use it said nome city manager jim 
stimpfle 
the soviet government sets the rubles value artificially apart 
from the market fluctuations that determine other currencies 
values it is illegal in most cases to take rubles out of the 
soviet union but many soviet travelers to nome do bring rubles 
with them merchants say 
since the ice curtain between alaska and the soviet far east 
began thawing in the late 1980s nome has seen an influx of soviet 
visitors on cultural scientific and other exchanges soviet 
eskimos are allowed to visit their alaska counterparts without 
visas 
many nome residents likewise have visited soviet cities like 
magadan anadyr and the closest city provideniya about 230 miles 
west of nome 
a year ago nomebased bering air began allowing soviet citizens 
to pay for trips to alaska with rubles and the nome chamber of 
commerce followed suit early this year urging businesses to accept 
the soviet money 
bering air has an average of two charter flights weekly between 
provideniya and nome resulting in a fairly steady stream of soviet 
visitors 
stimpfle said he has visited the soviet far east seven times and 
sees many opportunities for trade 
we can make it work if theyll let us use their currency we 
can start a market system much faster and we dont have to wait 
for a convertible ruble he said but the soviets just want 
dollars dollars dollars dollars 
bering air president jim rowe is paid in rubles by customers in 
provideniya and puts the rubles in a soviet bank but soviet 
authorities require that he use dollars or even barter items like 
calculators and typewriters to pay landing fees so he has 
nothing to spend the rubles on 
in january he gave 80000 rubles to soviet schools and 
hospitals rather then let them be taxed in the bank said chris 
rowe his wife and the companys vice president

imagine the newsroom of the mary tyler moore 
show seduced by the dark side of the force and you have 
wiou 
its the same people in different bodies acting out a premise 
gone wrong at its best tonights premiere is a bleak black 
comedy of television manners rich with the irony that what happens 
in front of the camera rarely corresponds with what goes on behind 
it 
at its worst it strains to introduce a raft of characters 
establish their relationships and tell a story a fine cast 
horribly wasted is under orders to create caricatures instead of 
characters 
they struggle heroically to create dramatic tension out of a 
fundamentally flawed script 
wiou is wndy a financially ailing chicago tv station at the 
bottom of the ratings 
john shea plays hank zaret newly named the stations third news 
director inside a year exiled from new york by network brass over 
a careerthreatening screwup his mandate is to turn the station 
around 
this displeases his immediate subordinate executive producer 
liz mcvay mariette hartley whos been passed over for his job 
and it reintroduces him to an old flame kelby robinson helen 
shaver an ambitious reporter angling for a shot at anchoring the 
news 
shea hartley and shaver give wiou its only semblance of 
rational adult behavior and professionalism otherwise its a 
newsroom filled with outlandish characters conforming to our worst 
expectations of stereotypes 
harris yulin who has moments of magnificence plays the 
reptilian sexist pompous anchor whos pulling down a 
millionthree and cant keep his hands to himself 
dick van patten portraying a shameless ham of a weatherman can 
expect a bill for royalties from willard scott joe grifasi plays 
the cynical flack a pr hustler obsessed with ratings 
phil morris plays the shallow shameless nakedly ambitious 
reporter out to make a name for himself 
jayne brook plays the earnest young producer getting her shot as 
a reporter and wallace langham is the eager young intern who 
worships her 
as the shows publicity says the personal and professional 
lives of these men and women in front of the cameras and behind the 
scenes are brought sharply into focus as they confront the 
harrowing deadlines newsroom politics ratings battles and ethical 
dilemmas which are literally all in a days work 
nuff said 
nah 
heres a taste of whats to come 
the shameless nakedly ambitious reporter arrives at the scene 
of the fire 
if this is a twoalarm fire im mrs olearys cow quoth 
he 
then the earnest young producer interviews a fire victim the 
father of a missing child agonized she cuts off the pompous 
anchors really dreadful questions when they intrude on the 
fathers grief 
she stops the interview but lets the cameraman continue his 
tight shot on the weeping mans face for about five minutes 
sensitive eh 
whats genuinely incredible about this program is that two of 
its executive producers its cocreators and the pilots 
cowriters john eisendrath and kathryn pratt actually worked at 
chicagos wbbmtv owned and operated by cbs 
given the opportunity to say something about their former craft 
its horrors absurdities and the vast majority of hardworking news 
professionals they give us cliches 
 
elsewhere in television 
you might otherwise not notice dept art of indonesia

when housing prices are falling and investment 
analysts are frothing about a collapse of the real estate market 
there still is no safer place for your money than the home in which 
you live 
the truth of the statement lies in the historical evidence it 
shows that while price declines do occur they are rare and 
relatively shortlived and that housing prices recover with the 
economy and often grow faster than it 
still you would have to be hard of hearing not to detect the 
shrieking of the sirens the screeching of the alarmists the blare 
of the headlines houses unsold after 12 months on the market 
sellers cutting prices 50000 
so what homeowners know that no matter what the market analysts 
say they do not lose money on their houses until they choose to 
sell or have to sell 
some of the bearish comments come from academe some from 
writers seeking to cash in on homeowner fears some from brokerage 
house analysts who tend to view a house solely as an investment 
rather than a place in which to live 
this week a brokerage house analyst commented sagely that 
thousands of people who purchased houses three years ago have a 
loss on their investment a statement that bears little resemblance 
to facts or reality 
most of the people who live in those homes would in fact be 
surprised and mystified to hear that they had lost money since 
nowhere in their checking accounts or tax records is there any 
evidence of such losses 
the tendency to view housing solely as an investment and to 
measure its value by the month and year rather than by the decade 
is reflective more of a wall street traders mentality than that of 
a homeowner 
traders constantly price their portfolios homeowners do not 
traders live day to day homeowners live for longterm goals 
traders can do little to improve the value of their shares 
homeowners constantly make improvements 
moreover homeowners are constantly paying down the mortgage 
obtaining tax benefits and enjoying the kind of physical protection 
for ones head that no stock bond or other security can provide 
after examining the claims of housing doomsayers harvard 
universitys joint center for housing studies an impartial 
assessor offered this reassurance 
contrary to popular reports about the impending home price 
crash todays homeowners have little reason to worry they 
backed it with statistics showing that except for brief periods 
housing keeps pace with the economy 
while it may be necessary to ride out a shortterm down cycle 
over time home prices tend to rise at or above the general rate of 
inflation making housing a solid investment and key component in 
the financial security of the current and future generations of 
elderly americans 
they offered the hypothetical example of a household that in 
1974 bought a typical singlefamily home in boston for 89144 
1989 dollars 
assuming the buyers had a 30year fixedrate mortgage and sill 
owned the home in 1989 the paydown of the mortgage principal and 
appreciation in prices would have boosted equity in the home by 
140192 
at that price they would have had an inflationadjusted compound 
annual growth rate of 151 percent 
had they purchased the house in 1980 paying a higher price but 
enjoying greater inflation during the 1980s real equity would have 
grown at 246 percent annually 
and even if the house had been purchased in 1986 when the 
explosive boston market was near its peak the homeowner would have 
realized equity gains of 169 percent in each of the following 
three years 
let the doomsayers shout let them denounce housing as an 
investment let them try to frighten you with predictions of doom 
safe in your own home you can ride out the storm knowing better 
times lie ahead

european countries preparing for a un conference 
on global warming have forged a consensus on the need for action 
breaking with the goslow policy of the united states 
the us policy however may threaten the outcome of the 10day 
second world climate conference which begins monday in geneva 
optimists had hoped it would set an agenda for hard negotiations 
on details of a climate convention now it seems the united states 
will block any move to set targets for reducing emissions of carbon 
dioxide a key greenhouse gas 
global warming from the greenhouse effect occurs when carbon 
dioxide methane and other pollutants build up in the atmosphere 
trapping the suns heat like a greenhouse 
of 100 nations attending the conference only egypt 
oilproducer saudi arabia and perhaps the soviet union which fears 
the economic consequences of a treaty are likely to support the 
us position 
in april at a global warming conference in washington 
environment minister hans topfer of west germany disputed president 
bushs claim that more research was needed to sort out the 
science 
speaking for near 
chrysalis house a residential substance abuse program in maryland 
the first is youre an addict the second strike is youre a 
female if a female addict happens to be pregnant in the eyes of 
most of the country youre at the bottom of the heap 
in fact some prosecutors citing concerns for the children 
have charged pregnant drug users with crimes sometimes jailing 
them 
since 1987 more than 50 criminal cases have been filed against 
women for drug abuse during pregnancy about 80 percent of them 
minorities the american civil liberties union says 
civil libertarians argue that this drives addicts away from 
prenatal care 
prosecutors are telling them to get clean or be arrested and 
theyll take away their kids said the aclus isabelle pinzler 
there arent the places for drug treatment and the places that 
exist frequently wont take them 
it forces them to make a sophies choice either getting 
healthy or abandoning the child in foster care or a dysfunctional 
family from which they themselves came said her colleague lynn 
paltrow 
more than 5 million women of childbearing age use illegal drugs 
including more than 1 million who take cocaine the national 
institute on drug abuse said in 1988 up to 375000 babies may be 
exposed to drugs annually according to the national association 
for perinatal addiction research and education 
while those numbers indicate the scope of a problem exacerbated 
by the crack epidemic others suggest glaring inadequacies in 
treatment consider 
some 280000 pregnant women nationwide needed drug treatment 
yet less than 30000 received care according to a 1990 survey by 
the national association of state alcohol and drug abuse directors 
twothirds of 18 bigcity hospitals surveyed last year by a 
us house committee had no place to send pregnant women for drug 
treatment 
a new york study found 54 percent of treatment programs 
excluded expectant women 87 percent rejected pregnant medicaid 
recipients addicted to crack 
they think there will be a terrible malpractice problem 
because of potential pregnancy complications speculates dr wendy 
chavkin the author and an associate professor at the columbia 
school of public health 
all of this is especially frustrating experts say because 
pregnancy often motivates women to seek help 
if they dont find a program out there chances are weve lost 
them mrs hudicek said some die some end up in hospital 
emergency rooms giving birth to crackaddicted babies 
part of the american way is motherhood and apple pie she 
added the stigma that women face admitting theyre addicted 
to drugs is incredible 
cynthia a chrysalis house resident and new mother knows the 
feeling 
you already have low selfesteem said the recovering 
cocaineheroin addict who asked that her last name not be used 
finally you do humble yourself to say i have a problem and 
theres a bunch of excuses they say we cant help you now 
come back in 30 days you may die you may get incarcerated 
or you may get sick cocaine doctors say increases the risk of 
premature delivery and lifethreatening hemorrhages and can cause 
physical and neurological damage to babies 
pregnant addicts often ignore their health one michigan woman 
said it was easier to walk four houses to buy crack than take a bus 
four miles for prenatal care others sell furniture food stamps 
even themselves for drugs 
about 180 addicts are in hutzels 21yearold program about 
half are pregnant and 50 percent of those women take methadone to 
prevent miscarriages 
hutzel provides counseling child care lunch transportation 
and prenatal care the residential recovery program houses women 
and their young children in a former convent 
many have long histories of addiction wanda kaigler now 37 
says her drug use began at age 16 she nearly died six years ago 
from bad heroin and though she survived and even quit once her 
habit has stripped her bare 
it makes you lose your friends your family your furniture 
your home your respect for yourself she said you feel 
terrible afterwards as long as you do it you feel good 
a widow for three years miss kaigler also lost her six 
children ages 2 to 17 when they were removed by authorities she 
wants them back proudly noting two are honors students 
i love my kids she said they dont think so sometimes 
i dont think so 
kelly barringtons concern for her baby coupled with the threat 
of losing her 9yearold daughter led her to hutzel 
god knew the only way i was going to stop is if i got 
pregnant said miss barrington a drug abuser for 15 of her 31 
years who switched to crack from heroin after her veins collapsed 
i couldnt live with the fact that i hurt an innocent baby 
she too had hit bottom she was jailed briefly lost 
everything and was so desperate shed drag her daughter to dope 
houses explaining she was sick and that was the medicine i 
needed 
her daughter responded by repeatedly breaking her crack pipes 
i try to forgive myself and say i was a sick person said 
miss barrington her purse adorned with badges for every month she 
has been drugfree i feel great that god gave me another chance 
to turn things around

eighty percent to 85 percent of the women complete hutzels 
pregnancy program which serves about 250 females a year about a 
quarter continue in recovery but more than half of those who 
inquire never show up 
some fear prosecutions will deter even more 
a massachusetts judge this month threw out an indictment 
charging a 24yearold mother with drug distribution for cocaine 
found in her infant son 
by imposing criminal sanctions a woman may turn away from 
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered thereby 
undermining the states asserted interests boston superior court 
judge suzanne v delvecchio said in her ruling 
but some prosecutors say they must help the children even if 
means charging and jailing pregnant women 
innocent children are horribly damaged by the use of cocaine 
if thats not child abuse i dont know what is said charles 
condon a south carolina solicitor who helps run a program in which 
pregnant users must enroll in treatment or risk arrest 
we dont want them to be prosecuted he said but you 
really have to give them consequences for their behavior 
at hutzel wanda kaigler knows all about consequences but she 
plans to stay clean and dreams of living with her kids away from 
drugs 
anything you have faith in and believe in she said you 
can have

when traci jackson gave birth to a stillborn child texas 
authorities say she had with her a deadly weapon it wasnt a gun 
or a knife but cocaine in her body 
thats what houston prosecutors will argue when the 20yearold 
woman faces trial nov 12 on a cocaine possession charge that could 
send her to prison for up to 20 years 
the trial is among more than 50 cases in 20 states and the 
district of columbia in which pregnant drug abusers have been 
charged with crimes ranging from child abuse or neglect to drug 
delivery homicide and assault with a deadly weapon 
in alaska a woman pleaded no contest in 1989 to criminally 
negligent homicide in the death of her 2weekold son which was 
tied to maternal cocaine use before birth 
in florida a woman was convicted last year of delivering drugs 
through the umbilical cord and sentenced to 15 years probation and 
in kentucky a 33yearold mother addicted to drugs and pills for 
half her life was sentenced this spring to five years in prison for 
child abuse 
these actions are all illegal extensions of the state statutes 
by prosecutors who want to get their names in the paper argues 
lynn paltrow an aclu attorney in new york 
some courts too have been troubled by this approach a boston 
judge this month dismissed a drug charge against a woman whose baby 
was born with cocaine in its system 
there is no familiar bond more intimate and more fundamental 
than that between the mother and the fetus she carries in her 
woman judge suzanne delvecchio wrote this court will not 
permit the destruction of this relationship by the prosecution 
but prosecutors say the threat of legal action is a strong 
incentive to seek treatment and an appropriate way to protect 
children 
its about time we notified those who would use cocaine while 
pregnant that theyd better stop it said casey obrien a 
houston prosecutor in the jackson case its just not fair to 
others its not fair to their children its not fair to society 
that takes on the responsibility for their children who 
survive or are damaged irreparably by cocaine 
in the houston case the state claims miss jackson her 
attorney says her real name is beverly amos entered a bathroom in 
an apartment and shortly thereafter gave birth to a stillborn baby 
later found inside a plastic bag in a closet 
the government says miss jackson used crack that day an autopsy 
found the baby had large quantities of cocaine in its liver 
prosecutors say dna testing provides circumstantial evidence she 
was the infants mother 
defense attorney alex bunin doesnt acknowledge the woman had a 
child and says the charge violates equal protection a man cannot 
be prosecuted for that crime he said 
bunin also says the state is unfairly attempting to punish the 
woman twice for possession and for the use of cocaine as a deadly 
weapon 
obrien said prosecutors dont have to prove the deadly weapon 
kills only that the manner in which it was used was capable of 
causing serious bodily injury or death 
the baby never had a chance obrien said the cocaine 
killed it in the womb whether it killed it legally or practically 
the result is the same

the cost of americas failure to ensure that 
pregnant women receive proper care can be calculated in the 
millions of dollars but it also can be measured in the tortured 
body of an infant born too soon and too small as mitchell 
landsberg finds in the last of a threepart series surviving 
year one

eric could almost fit in his fathers hand 
if his father were there to hold him he is so small so weak so 
sick a little boy pushed into the world far before his time 
he is kept alive by machines machines make eric breathe and 
machines keep eric warm machines feed him and machines record his 
heartbeat his pulse rate his temperature 
he lives in a sterile glass crib surrounded by banks of 
blinking lights tangled in a webbing of tubes and splints and 
bandages his eyes and his mouth open and shut and he writhes 
gently for all the machinery it is human suffering that contorts 
his face and a human will that keeps his tiny heart beating 
it shouldnt have been this way eric was born six months into 
his mothers pregnancy without benefit of meaningful prenatal care 
or decent nutrition and most likely with the damaging effects of 
drugs 
now eric like his sister before him is in the neonatal 
intensive care unit at the childrens hospital of new jersey here 
in the corroded core of one of americas poorest cities doctors 
and nurses struggle daily to save babies who enter life too soon 
too sick and too small 
this is so typical says social worker debbie beacher who 
has just finished listening to erics mother recite her story of 
drug abuse and homelessness an unwed mother young a drug 
abuser has a baby born prematurely that ends up in this unit 
it is like this around the nation in cities big and small in 
places like the hospital for sick children in washington dc and 
valley childrens hospital in fresno calif 
were seeing a growing need for our kind of hospital in just 
the past few years said dr edna leung a pediatrician at the 
hospital for sick children its sad we enjoy what we do but 
we just wish we could make some of these problems go away 
the problems wont go away and their legacy is children like 
eric society pays and the costs are enormous 
it costs about 600 to administer prenatal care to a woman 
during the nine months of a normal pregnancy drug treatment for a 
crack addict costs about 5000 
without prenatal care without drug treatment the risks of a 
woman delivering a premature low birthweight child increase 
dramatically and so do the costs 
it costs an average of about 25000 to treat a low birthweight 
infant one under 55 pounds for extremely low birthweight 
babies under 165 pounds the average is more than 100000 
thats an average some cost far more 
once the point would have been moot such tiny babies would 
have died at birth but medicine has made tremendous strides in 
saving them 
between 1980 and 1987 the infant mortality rate in the united 
states dropped by about 20 percent during the same period the 
percentage of infants born to mothers who had no early prenatal 
care scarcely changed and the percentage of low birthweight 
infants actually increased 
since birthweight is the single most important indicator of 
infant health the meaning is clear children are being born sicker 
than ever and medicine is using superior technology to keep them 
alive 
in fresno dr nadarasa visveshwara has been treating a baby 
that weighed exactly 1 pound at birth the childs mother who is 
on medicaid had received very little prenatal care 
the baby is now six months old the medical bills have topped 
750000 and probably will be around 1 million by the time the 
child is released from the hospital 
the prospects for the child ever enjoying a productive life 
visveshwara said are very poor 
does he ever ask is it wise to save such children 
almost all the time he said because we hesitate to 
produce an infant who will be a burden to the parents and to 
society and who wont be able to lead a productive life but 
the baby always gets the benefit of the doubt 
eric whose real name is being kept confidential weighed 
slightly more than 2 pounds at birth in 1960 his odds of 
surviving infancy would have been about one in 10 today they are 
better than 5050 
his medical bills are around 100000 and climbing and his 
parents have no ability to pay his birth was costly but not in 
financial terms alone there is an incalculable cost in pain and 
suffering in emotional distress and social disruption 
these are statistics for extremely low birthweight infants 
those somewhat smaller than eric 
90 percent will suffer respiratory problems 
70 percent will have brain hemorrhages 
80 percent will have heart problems 
50 percent will have liver problems 
5 percent to 10 percent will be blind 
2 percent to 3 percent will die of sudden infant death 
syndrome 
of those who survive 40 percent will be mildly handicapped 40 
percent will be severely handicapped and 20 percent will be normal 
theres more premature infants are much more likely than other 
children to have cerebral palsy they are much more likely to have 
learning disabilities later in life and children who spend their 
infancy in a hospital will have difficulty bonding with their 
families a trait also widely attributed to children exposed to 
drugs in the womb the longterm emotional costs are yet unknown 
theres just not that closeness and these kids have more 
difficulty when we get them home said dr john h niles jr 
president of the medical society of the district of columbia 
theyre just not the joy that a baby should be 
its like a vietnam kind of thing niles added these kids 
have been in a battle and there are going to be some scars and 
society is going to pay for those scars 
the easiest way to avoid the scars most people believe is to 
make prenatal care widely available and do whatever it takes to get 
women to take advantage of it 
the most commonly repeated statistic about prenatal care is that 
every 1 spent on it will save 330 in future medical costs 
dr shyan sun director of neonatology at the childrens 
hospital of new jersey is a skeptic he shuffles through a file 
drawer to pull out a list of everything his patients have going 
against them they are poor they are young they are unmarried 
uneducated they abuse drugs they drink they smoke 
one cannot naively believe that prenatal care alone will solve 
the problem sun insisted i am not optimistic that we will 
make a difference in the near future we still have to take care of 
all these social problems

it is a daunting prospect as eric and his mother illustrate 
erics mother who asked that she be called jane is 25 years old 
she was born prematurely herself and says her mother her brothers 
and sisters all were born prematurely too she is a small woman 
with sharp features and a dull stare eric is her fifth child all 
have been born prematurely and small 
my 2yearold he came home on a heart monitor so i dealt 
with that she says matteroffactly and my 6 yearold when 
he came home he was having seizures my oldest one he was the 
biggest of everybody he was 4 pounds 13 ounces 
jane was living in a homeless shelter during her pregnancy says she 
tried to get prenatal care but the doctor had 
an attitude and lectured her about eating corn chipwith 
eric she s she didnt 
go back 
she insists she stopped doing drugs before her pregnancy her 
social worker says thats a lie since eric was born the hospital 
has had to ask the police to pick up jane every time it needs her 
consent to perform surgery 
i hate to come here jane says it gets depressing seeing 
all those babies like that god forbid i get attached to him and he 
dies then ive got a real emotional problem there im not saying 
i dont love him ly home and 
help build a motel and other facilities to accommodate the tourist 
trade that is beginning to develop around the bandleaders former 
residence 
many rural communities where farms have been consolidated over 
the years causing a loss of economic base are looking to the 
government for help to develop other businesses 
about half the money in the bill 276 billion goes to feeding 
programs including 19 billion for food stamps and 25 billion 
for the women infant and children program 
food donations the special milk program and child nutrition 
programs also are covered by the bill 
the bill appropriates 5 billion for farm subsidies this year 
and continues the crop insurance program which had been stripped 
from the original house bill 
since 1980 the crop insurance program has lost over 26 
billion in indemnity payments said rep jamie whitten dmiss 
chairman of the house appropriations committee the 
administration in the past 10 years increased over 2 billion an 
increase of over 450 percent 
but at the urging of the senate whitten agreed to allow the 
program to continue if it is at least 75 percent actuarially sound 
and if usdas agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
takes control over policy sales and loss adjustments 
the ascs had controlled the program until 1980 when it was 
expanded to allow private insurance companies to issue policies to 
farmers the practice became costly because the private companies 
were reimbursed by the government for administrative expenses and 
operating losses 
specific agencies and their appropriations are 
farmers home administration 115 billion

two house agriculture subcommittee chairmen 
are opposing a chicago board of trade plan to double the number of 
grain and soybean futures contracts available to speculators 
rep dan glickman dkan said monday that such changes should 
not be made until the effects of the 1990 farm bill are known 
the bill which establishes new planting options as part of 
government budget cutting will dramatically change the commodities 
market said glickman chairman of the wheat soybeans and feed 
grains subcommittee 
he and rep glenn english dokla whose subcommittee oversees 
the commodity futures trading commission have asked the cftc to 
withhold approval of the chicago board of trade plan until next 
year 
the farm bill has been approved by a housesenate conference 
committee but awaits final votes in both chambers and the 
presidents signature 
in a letter to cftc chairman wendy gramm the chairmen said the 
chicago board of trade plan appears to be response to pressure from 
big commodity trading fund managers 
the funds have little interest in the price discovery or 
legitimate hedging functions of these markets and view them simply 
as another speculative venture to market to their customers the 
lawmakers wrote 
we do not believe the commission should approve the proposal 
until its proponents can verify with certainty that it will enhance 
the performance of these markets and allay fears that it will 
simply subject grain producers marketers and users to 
unnecessary damaging price fluctuations they added

joseph kelly crockett snuggled next to his 
mother too young to do much of anything except eat sleep and cry 
too young to know that he is starting life a step behind most other 
babies 
despite citywide efforts to improve health care services and 
lower indianapolis skyhigh infant mortality rate josephs mother 
struggled to get caseworkers at the marion county welfare 
department to extend medicaid to her fourth child 
they dont care or they dont want to care said lisa 
carter 24 its too much of a headache for them its almost as 
if youre asking them for 20 out of their pocket 
joseph was born prematurely he was delivered at 36 weeks by 
emergency caesarian and weighed 5 pounds and it took seven weeks 
before joseph was added to the welfare rolls before he could 
receive medicaid aid to families with dependent children food 
stamps 
in the interim the pediatrician and hospital didnt press for 
payment but miss carter had to pay for his food and transportation 
to the doctor herself 
josephs father tried to help but judging from the support he 
gave lisa during her pregnancy she knows she couldnt count on 
him 
nor could she count on the welfare department the conscientious 
caseworker who handled her file for two years recently quit with 
her departure returned the threats that the familys medicaid and 
aid to families with dependent children would be cut off because of 
improper paperwork 
but then miss carter says her medicaid coverage has been taken 
away twice both times unjustly she believes 
miss carter was 5 when her mother was murdered but she overcame 
that to become an a student in school 
at 16 her first child taron smith was born but she overcame 
that to graduate from high school 
two years later she was working toward an associates degree in 
secretarial sciences when her grandmother became ill she quit 
school to care for her and never returned 
at 19 her daughter shenika was born weighing just 4 pounds 12 
ounces miss carter had become a single teenage mother with two 
young children and she couldnt find a way out 
im not stupid but i have had plenty of tragic situations in 
my life she said but i cant use that as a crutch 
in indiana a family of four must be living below 327 percent 
of the federal poverty level bringing in less than 385 a month 
to be eligible for medicaid and afdc only alabama arkansas 
louisiana new mexico north carolina texas and west virginia have 
stricter standards 
for pregnant women and children under 6 years old the picture 
is brighter because of federal mandates 
in april congress required all states to provide medicaid 
coverage to pregnant women and young children with family incomes 
below 133 percent of the federal poverty level 1972 per month 
for a family of four 
miss carter feeds clothes and shelters her family on child 
support she receives from the childrens fathers and on her 405 in 
monthly afdc payments the states maximum payment for a family of 
five thirtysix states have higher payments 
even a parttime job at minumum wage would boost her income 
above the states limits she and her oldest child would be 
ineligible for medicaid and the whole family would lose its afdc 
and food stamps 
still miss carter has goals shes looking for a job that pays 
enough to take care of her four children she wants to return to 
school 
my situation is not something thats good for my baby or my 
other three babies she said i want to help myself but i need 
support and i dont have any

carol sanders baby was born in an infant 
mortality disaster area a neighborhood where community health 
workers measure success in newborn ounces and weeks in the womb 
in this urban death zone tyrone lamont payton survives with a 
vengeance 
he arrived in triumph two days shy of his due date a strapping 
8 pounds 14 ounces nineteenyearold carols fourth child he was 
the first who wasnt born too soon and too small 
more babies die each year in carol sanders impoverished 
neighborhood than any other in indianapolis until recently black 
babies died at a higher rate in indianapolis than any big city in 
america and more babies die in america than any other western 
industrialized nation 
babies born in hungary or poland had a better chance of 
celebrating their first birthdays than any baby carol sanders 
carried 
enter wafiyyah harrison a mountain of a woman with enough 
compassion wit and strength of purpose to wring a little happiness 
from the hopelessness in the violent innercity neighborhood 
nicknamed little detroit 
harrison helped sanders help herself and the result was the 
vigorous good health of tyrone lamont payton 
i tell them youve got to meet me halfway it comes down to 
do you want a healthy baby or do you not said harrison one of 
four community health workers with the maternity outreach mobile 
project care coordination team if youre below the poverty line 
you cannot afford to have a specialneeds baby so you need to do 
what it is you need to do 
across the nation health workers haunt innercity housing 
projects and rural shacks staging a frontal assault on the forces 
that feed infant mortality statistics the savings in lives and 
money recently persuaded the general accounting office to recommend 
that congress fund homevisiting through medicaid 
myself i didnt have the best life coming up sanders said 
hugging her youngest daughter against a swollen belly just before 
tyrones birth but im going to give them the best that i can 
not all women who need help having healthy babies are as ready 
to cooperate as sanders a hand offered is not always accepted the 
outreach workers have been dismayed to learn 
carol sanders sister was five months pregnant with her second 
child and already in preterm labor when harrison began visiting 
unhappy about her pregnancy the 18yearold ignored most of the 
health workers advice about rest and diet the result was 2pound 
5ounce antonette born at 28 weeks and lingering in the hospital 
intensive care nursery weeks after her fullterm cousin had gone 
home with his mother 
theres one group that all we need to do is get them hooked up 
with prenatal care improve their nutrition teach them basic 
parenting mom project director joanne martin said but theres 
another reservoir of people for whom thats not enough they have a 
lot of problems in their lives and being pregnant is only one of 
them for that group we need to be more creative and not throw up 
our hands in despair 
despair runs deep in indianapolis innercity neighborhoods 
where toddlers play in dirt shiny with broken glass and houses sag 
and rot behind boarded windows in the worst of these areas where 
the sanders sisters live 37 of every 1000 babies die before age 
1 
but city officials were unaware of the deaths in the shadows of 
their new downtown skyscrapers and sports facilities until the fact 
was splashed across the front pages of local papers 
the news was bleak in 1986 and 1987 more black infants died in 
indianapolis than any other major city in america at a rate of 
more than 23 per thousand stunned city leaders hastily did their 
own calculations there was no mistake 
its a shock when you see these headlines and wonder whos not 
doing their job said dave arland spokesman for mayor william 
hudnut but its been a situation of not addressing it not 
addressing it not addressing it over the years and then we wind 
up at the top of the heap 
a citycounty commission that studied the problem discovered a 
horribly overburdened health care system clinics didnt exist in 
the neighborhoods with the highest infant death rates and a woman 
could wait weeks for an appointment at existing facilities and the 
seemingly simple task of riding a bus to the hospital or clinic was 
arduous and timeconsuming 
indianapolis problems are endemic to bigcity and rural 
america and are reflected by the dismal us infant mortality 
rate 
improvement in the rate stalled in 1985 for the first time in 20 
years that same year there were increases in the number of babies 
born with a low birthweight and born prematurely under 5 pounds 
and before 37 weeks gestation 
low birthweight babies are 40 times more likely to die during 
the first month of life a very low birthweight baby like 
antonette who weighs less than 3 pounds is 200 times more likely 
to die in her first month of life than her normal weight cousin 
tyrone 
about 40000 babies younger than 12 months die annually in the 
united states twothirds of those in the first 28 days of life 
two black infants die for every white one the worst racial 
disparity in 50 years 
health officials say infant death hits the black community 
disproportionately because black women and their babies suffer more 
from the ravages of poverty lack of education inadequate prenatal 
care lower maternal age a high number of previous and unwanted 
births poor nutrition smoking and substance abuse 
alter those factors and save lives said the national commission 
to prevent infant mortality which called in 1988 for universal 
access to health care for pregnant women and their infants as a 
crucial first step 
there is an answer said commission executive director rae 
grad adding that half of all us infant deaths are preventable 
its basic boring straightforward its feeding women making 
sure they have health care making sure their babies have health 
care this isnt glamorous stuff that makes the cover of time 
magazine but it works it saves money and it saves lives

indianapolis officials reached the same conclusion since then 
four new clinics have opened in the city a computer netork helps 
track patients when they move from one clinic to another a motor 
coach equipped with a stateoftheart ultrasound machine part of 
the march of dimesfunded mom project travels to different county 
clinic sites to serve those patients 
this fall four carecoordination teams are fanning out across 
the city the black infant mortality rate is falling the rate for 
1988 the most recent year available is 203 per 1000 down from 
237 in 1987 
so far the mom project team has taken 270 referrals and opened 
183 cases sixtyeight babies have been born only five of them 
under 5 pounds a low birthweight rate half that of the area they 
serve 
the infant mortality commission estimates that every 
lowbirthweight birth the workers avert represents an instant 
savings of 14000 to 30000 at most the team has only to 
prevent 14 such births to equal its own annual operating costs 
the four mom project health workers try to spend at least eight 
hours a week doing outreach haunting medicaid lines and welfare 
offices jumping out of cars to talk to women on city streets 
are you pregnant they ask do you know anyone who is 
thats how harrison found tracy kersey 17 and already the 
mother of one who settled her bulk uncomfortably in a chair and 
proudly announced she no longer smokes harrisons support made it 
possible 
you feel like its somebody there for you when you dont have 
nobody there kersey said shes someone you can talk to when 
youre down and have troubles 
food and housing are scarce but trouble is something these 
women have in abundance among the projects client list are an 
anorexic chainsmoker in hiding from an abusive partner a 
13yearold girl with an alcoholic mother and a woman who boasted 
of getting drunk every weekend during her pregnancy now her fetal 
alcohol syndrome baby is on their rounds too 
being a mother yourself you feel all mothers want the best 
for their babies mom outreach worker claudia thompson said 
then youll run into situations where you begin to wonder now 
are they concerned at all about this child but i understand it 
because theyve got all these other problems 
the mom project workers deal in basics first assessing each 
womans health and educating about nutrition preterm labor and 
other problems they provide referrals for food housing medicaid 
and wic the federal supplemental food program that provides free 
food nutrition education prenatal care and counseling to mothers 
and children visits continue until the baby turns 1 
less than half of women and children entitled to medicaid and 
wic are actually enrolled in the programs in the united states 
many women dont realize they are eligible some simply dont know 
what resources are available and they make no effort to find out 
the health workers say 
a lot of these people are in denial they deny they have five 
or six babies and are on welfare i look at pregnant women who 
dont want to do anything for themselves as people who are in 
denial harrison said 
until you accept that you have a problem theres nothing i 
can do and thats the way i look at it you have to accept you 
have a problem whether its poverty no food pregnancy 
then theres always something we can do

reed tuckson remembers his mother the nurse donning her hat 
and climbing into a little blue car to visit poor families in their 
homes and teach other mothers how to plan their pregnancies and 
care for their babies 
by the time tuckson became washington dc health commissioner 
decades later the system that had supported visiting nurses like 
his mother had collapsed under budget constraints and desperate 
nursing shortages in 1989 tuckson had just eight community health 
nurses for the entire city 
such nurses remain in short supply but home visitation programs 
using lay workers have begun to proliferate as government officials 
recognize the health benefits and costeffectiveness 
basic prenatal care can cost as little as 500 the lifetime 
costs of caring for a lowbirthweight baby can hit 500000 
about 4500 home visiting programs exist nationwide although 
fewer than onethird address the problems of pregnant women and 
their babies 
at least 10 european countries all of which have lower infant 
mortality rates than the united states use home visiting to some 
extent and some programs are universal virtually every british 
and danish newborn is seen by a home visitor who is a nurse or 
midwife 
american programs which date back 100 years usually target 
disadvantaged families and home visitors are likely to be women 
from the community who have overcome the same problems their 
clients face 
in many home visiting programs its not uncommon to find 
households with no plumbing no cooking facilities households 
overrun by vermin substantial family dysfunction with drug use and 
violence many families lack the basics for survival said dr 
david olds who began a homevisiting program in 1978 in elmira 
ny 
olds program tracked babies until they were 2 and found that 
they were heavier at birth and less likely to be abused or 
neglected four years later the homevisited mothers had more 
months of employment and fewer subsequent pregnancies and were more 
likely to have postponed the birth of a second child 
in norfolk va the resource mothers program targets pregnant 
teenagers by linking them with trained community workers who help 
them get prenatal care and educate them about health during 
pregnancy since the program began in 1985 the low birthweight 
rate for homevisited teen mothers has dropped to 6 percent 
compared with 94 percent for teenagers nationwide 
the general accounting office in july recommended that congress 
extend medicaid coverage to home visitation programs although it 
also recommended more research to determine exactly which kinds of 
programs work best congress recently approved but failed to fund a 
network of home healthcare workers

at reducing low birthweight and infant mortality

digital equipment corp has joined the move 
toward open computer standards planning an announcment for 
later this week about modifications to its flagship line 
the worlds secondlargest computer maker plans will announce 
thursday that it is changing its vax computers so they can run 
software designed for the popular unix operating system 
that means companies equipped with both vax and unixbased 
computers could run the same software on all saving the cost of 
buying or writing a second version of the software 
analysts said digital was pushed into the change by a slumping 
market for its proprietary machines which cannot easily be 
connected with computers made by other companies or operate 
software designed for those machines 
an operating system is the base layer of software than controls 
a computers internal housekeeping functions applications 
software such as word processing programs provide specific 
functions for the computers and run on top of an operating system 
digital said it will release a new version of its vax operating 
system next year that will adhere to an opensystem standard called 
posix posix in turn is compatible with unix 
digital also said it intends to have the operating system 
certified by an international group called xopen ltd which 
promotes opensystem computing 
analysts said digital based in maynard mass needs to make 
its vax computer line more attractive 
there is clearly a slowdown in orders for vax said jay 
stevens who follows the computer industry for dean witter reynolds 
inc 
part of that sluggishness is due to the desire for open systems 
but it also is due to a delay by customers in ordering new digital 
computers while they await promised new models analysts said 
one such model also to be announced thursday is a new topend 
version of the vax 6000 midrange computer line the vax 6000 model 
500 will offer 85 percent more processing power than the current 
topend 6000 but only cost 18 percent more said stephen 
blanchette the lines marketing manager 
digital officials admit the move to open systems is driven by 
the marketplace 
it is apparent that opensystems computing is the way of the 
future and digital intends to address that market said phil 
auberg marketing manager for the vax software line 
while digitals move is important for a company that has 
relentlessly promoted a proprietary computer line it isnt unique 
ncr corp made perhaps the most dramatic move into open systems of 
any oldline computer maker with an announcement last month that it 
will replace the companys entire product range with opensystem 
machines 
digital also will announce thursday that it will phase into the

two commodity traders who contend trading rules 
were broken routinely at the chicago mercantile exchange have won 
more time at least with their unusual defense against federal 
fraud charges 
ray paces lawyer thinks it will be late spring before pace and 
sam a cali return to court after us district judge william t 
hart ruled they should be tried separately from 12 other japanese 
yen futures traders 
the decision monday came about six weeks into the yen traders 
trial hart did not set a date for the separate trial of cali and 
pace 
hart said evidence presented by cali and pace might prejudice 
the jury against the other defendants who have denied breaking 
rules 
all 14 defendants had sought to have cali and pace severed from 
the trial 
calis lawyer thomas durkin said he was tremendously 
encouraged by harts decision 
i read his opinion as a validation of the defense durkin 
said we intend to vigorously pursue it when we get the 
opportunity 
paces lawyer steve rosenberg was less enthusiastic i think 
the decision is a fair one but how this all ends up remains to be 
seen he said 
durkin and rosenberg suggested in their opening arguments last 
month that almost every trader at the merc violates trading rules 
almost daily and that exchange officials are aware of the problem 
the merc has denied that its officials knew about or condoned 
rule violations 
durkin and rosenberg contend any rule violations their clients 
may have committed do not constitute fraud or racketeering the 
crimes with which they are charged 
hart denied motions for a mistrial by several defendants who 
contended the opening statement already had prejudiced the jury 
against them 
the case resulted from an fbi investigation of corruption at the 
merc and the larger chicago board of trade the worlds two biggest 
commodity exchanges 
the defendants are accused of cheating customers by executing 
their orders outside the trading pit or at lessthanoptimal 
prices 
a similar trial involving 10 soybean futures traders from the 
chicago board of trade is continuing 
in the first of the three scheduled trials one swiss franc 
futures trader from the merc was acquitted and two others were 
convicted july 9 of minor trading violations leaving the jury 
deadlocked on fraud and racketeering charges 
a retrial on the unresolved charges from that trial is to begin 
march 5

pathe communications corp has the money it 
needs to finish its 13 billion buyout of mgmua communications 
co the studio behind the oscarwinning rain man and the james 
bond and rocky films 
pathe and mgmua announced monday that the beverly hillsbased 
entertainment conglomerate had delivered the 967 million balance 
of the purchase price 
mgmuas board of directors scheduled a meeting for today on a 
sale of the historic studio 
pathe headed by italian financier giancarlo parretti said it 
hopes to close the deal by weeks end 
combined with previous installments totalling 353 million the 
payments fulfill the purchase price of 13 billion 
of the additional 967 million pathe said almost 600 million 
was raised through a private placement of stock in the new company 
pathe spokesman craig parsons said details of the offering would 
be revealed in securities and exchange commission filings later 
this week he did not identify the new investors but said pathe 
would maintain a majority interest in the new company 
mgmua executives declined to comment further on mondays 
announcement over the last two years production at the studio has 
slowed to a crawl as mgmua has gone through a variety of aborted 
takeovers 
pathe on sunday sold englishlanguage television rights for 
nearly 1000 mgmua films to turner broadcasting system inc as 
part of a deal under which mgmua will help finance its own 
purchase 
that transaction was valued at a reported 200 million 
the mgmuapathe deal has been delayed by parrettis financial 
difficulties and an acrimonious split between pathe and time warner 
inc 
time warner was to have contributed 650 million toward the 
purchase price in exchange for a lien on the valuable united 
artists film library and extensive distribution rights to pathe and 
ua movies 
time warner dropped out of the deal and sued pathe for 100 
million claiming pathe doublesold some distribution rights 
ever since kirk kerkorian placed mgmua on the blocks in april 
1988 the sale has been a spectacular odyssey of failed financing 
lawsuits and juicy gossip 
kerkorian who owns 80 percent of the company has been 
approached by rupert murdochs news corp australias qintex 
entertainment inc polygram nv mca inc japans c itoh and 
co barris industries inc several unidentified foreign investors 
and the walt disney co 
a 1989 deal with qintex appeared to be one of the most likely to 
be completed but the 15 billion transaction fell apart when 
qintex was unable to raise the money 
parretti is an elusive figure the son of an olive merchant he 
made his fortune he says by buying restructuring and selling 
troubled european companies he has predicted that one day he will 
preside over the biggest film group in the world 
parretti bought the financially strapped cannon group movie 
studio purveyors of exploitation titles like river of death 
in 1988 for 200 million

labor analysts say a move by chrysler corp 
toward a contract with the canadian auto workers may bode well for 
talks with the united auto workers union in the united states 
canadian union president bob white on monday received a new 
economic proposal from chrysler canada ltd and called it a great 
relief 
its clear that were not going to have to fight to get a 
basic economic agreement he said theyve clearly indicated 
that theyre ready to meet the pattern 
white said dozens of issues remained unresolved but he was 
confident a contract could be reached by the midnight thursday 
deadline the union has set 
the uaw and the canadian union are pressing chrysler to accept 
pattern agreements reached with general motors corp and ford motor 
co 
uaw workers at ford plants in the united states ratified by a 
4to1 vote a new national agreement mirroring the gmuaw 
agreement the union said monday uaw and ford executives are to 
sign the new contract friday 
before the canadian union received chrysler canadas economic 
proposal there had been speculation that bargaining with the 
smallest of the big three automakers on both sides of the border 
would be tough 
but after whites comments analysts said that may not be the 
case 
since the uaw and chrysler began bargaining in the united states 
in midjuly company officials have said chrysler faced severe 
economic problems after the uaw pattern agreement was reached 
chrysler said the deal was too expensive 
it indicates that the negotiations could very well proceed 
more smoothly in the united states despite chryslers rhetoric to 
date said harley shaiken a labor professor at the university of 
california in san diego 
there was no immediate comment from uaw officials bargaining at 
chrysler headquarters in highland park 
chrysler spokesman lee sechler said monday he couldnt comment 
on the canadian talks or their significance on talks with the uaw 
its two separate sets of negotiations he said 
despite that shaiken and harry katz a labor professor at 
cornell university in ithaca ny said it was likely chrysler 
would accept the pattern agreement with the uaw 
i all along have thought that chrysler was going to have to 
conform to the pattern because the union was not about to give them 
a major exception katz said 
there are differences between the uaw and the canadian union 
pattern contracts 
the uaw contract calls for a 3 percent wage increase in the 
first year and lumpsum payments of 3 percent in each of the next 
two years the canadian union contract calls for wage increases of 
75 percent in the first year 67 percent in the second and 48 
percent in the third 
before wage increases in the new contracts uaw workers were 
getting about 1570 an hour including costofliving allowances 
canadian union workers received about 1550 hourly 
one of the big differences is health care the uaw agreement 
calls for no change in the system for providing health care to gm 
and ford employees the big three spent about 45 billion for 
health care last year 684 million of that by chrysler 
a national healthcare system in canada covers much of the 
healthcare cost for canadian workers

a federal judge has reserved judgement on 
whether the ltv corp must reassume liability for more than 2 
billion in employee pension plans it stopped funding in 1987 
us district judge robert sweet of manhattan heard arguments 
monday on a request by the federal pension guaranty corp to make 
the dallas steel aerospace and energy concern take back 
responsibility for the pension plans 
fpgc general counsel carol connor flowe said sweet had to shift 
liability in light of a recent supreme court ruling 
the high courts june ruling upheld the federal pension agencys 
decision to force ltvs clevelandbased steel unit ltv steel 
corp to reassume pension obligations for three underfunded plans 
which were to provide for more than 60000 ltv retirees and active 
employees 
its time now to enter judgement and to let the workers and 
retirees in these pension funds get their benefits flowe said 
but ltv attorney lewis b kaden said the high court had decided 
only legal issues and had not taken into account the companys 
current financial situation 
the issue that has to be decided is the legality of the order 
here today not three years ago kaden said 
he said ltv which is in chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
would not have assets to fund the pension plans 
kaden however said sweet had authority to consider certain 
legal issues among them whether ltv could be compelled to make 
contributions into the pension plans and whether plans that had no 
assets could be restored 
you cant engage in a futile act he said 
flowe claimed ltv was merely arguing positions already rejected 
by the supreme court 
the judge indicated that he thought the issues raised by kaden 
could be resolved in bankruptcy court 
i really intuitively adopt miss flowes thought on the changed 
circumstance argument that this is not the place for that to be 
worked out he told kaden 
at a later point sweet said the question is how much of this 
poison dish am i going to be able to pass on 
lawyers for ltvs various creditors also urged the judge against 
returning liability to the company arguing that the move could 
disrupt ltvs attempts to reorganize 
ltv filed for protection from its creditors in july 1986 
the litigation stems back to 1987 when ltv stopped funding the 
pension plans and the fpgc assumed liability 
a few months later a new ltv labor contract with the united 
steelworkers of america restored some retirement benefits similar 
to those in the terminated plans 
the fpgc claimed that the company was taking unfair advantage of 
federal funds to cut costs and ordered ltv to reassume liability 
for the three terminated plans 
when ltv challenged the order fpgc went to court 
in june 1988 sweet ruled that the agency improperly ordered ltv 
to reassume the plans operations a year later a federal appeals 
court agreed that fpgc had exceeded its legal authority 
but the supreme court reversed the lower courts and sided with 
the fpgc in its june ruling which said ltv had to take back 
liability for the plans

rupert murdoch chief executive of 
news corp ltd said tuesday that he expects his debtladen 
international media company will increase earnings this fiscal 
year 
murdoch told the annual meeting of shareholders that despite 
uncertainties in some of the companys major markets he expects

companys shortterm debt problems that helped depress news corps 
stock price in recent weeks 
news corps shortterm debt soared last fiscal year to 230 
billion from 396 million 
total debt rose to 821 billion from 613 billion 
news corp stock closed tuesday up about 50 cents to 475 in 
australian stock market trading 
in an interview monday murdoch said his empire will

news corp profits 
his international holdings include interests in the fox 
television network in the united states and a 51 percent holding in 
the suth china morning post in hong kong 
in the last fiscal year ended june 30 news corp reported 
earnings that earnings dropped 755 percent to 267 million 
largely because of losses at murdochs skytv satellite 
broadcasting business in britain and a pilots strike at the 
halfowned ansett australia airline 
shareholders approved tuesday a resolution allowing directors to 
issue limitedvoting shares murdoch wants to be able to issue such 
shares so the company can raise funds without diluting his 45 
percent stake in the company 
on oct 3 murdoch merged four of his australian newspapers into 
two aroundtheclock productions a move that reflected 
increasingly tough times in the australian media business 
the morning melbourne sun and afternoon herald became the 
heraldsun on oct 8 the same day that the daily telegraphmirror 
was formed from the merger of the morning sydney daily telegraph

walt disney co is close to arranging a 
filmproduction financing package worth at least 600 million 
backed largely by japanese investors the wall street journal 
reported today 
the financing would pay for nearly all of disneys motion 
picture output for part of 1991 and at least part of 1992 and 
would mark the largest infusion yet of japanese money into a major 
hollwywood studio short of acquisition the journal account said 
it quoted some industry observers as saying the transaction 
would be the largest single such financing in hollywood history and 
that the final figure could be closer to 1 billion 
the journal said financing would be backed by two japanese 
banks the longterm credit bank of japan ltd and fuji bank ltd 
and two us banking companies citicorp and manufacturers hanover 
corp 
officials from disney and the banks declined to comment on the 
journal account which apparently was based on industry sources 
the reported transaction reflects the allure of hollywood 
investments for the japanese sony corp bought columbia pictures 
entertainment inc in 1989 for 5 billion and mca inc has been 
talking with matsushita electric industrial co about a possible 
acquisition worth as much as 86 billion 
the newspaper said the japanese financing package for disney 
would replace the silver screen limited partnerships that have 
financed the companys filmmaking efforts over the past five years 
with more than 1 billion 
it said disney and silver screen have been far apart in recent 
talks about extending their relationship and that was one reason 
that disney sought alternative financing from japanese investors 
disney has three separate film labels disney touchstone and 
hollywood pictures which plan to produce about 25 films a year 
the average film costs about 25 millin to produce and nearly that 
much to promote and distribute

grain and soybean futures prices were slightly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade as the 
advancing corn and soybean harvest pressured the markets 
a weekly agriculture department report released late monday 
showed the corn harvest was 47 percent complete and the soybean 
harvest 57 percent complete as of sunday 
the corn harvest remains far behind the average pace of 58 
percent for that date although soybean producers have nearly 
caught up to the norm after planting the crop late due to heavy 
spring rains 
harvest progress could speed up considerably next week if a 
national weather service forecast for warm dry weather in the 
midwest pans out analysts said 
in early trading wheat futures prices were cent to cent 
lower with the contract for delivery in december at 262 a 
bushel corn was cent to 1 cent lower with december at 229 a 
bushel oats were cent lower across the board with december at 
124 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with 
november at 608 a bushel 
cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were 
higher in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
following usda reports monday that showed more cattle on feedlots 
and fewer pork bellies in commercial freezers than traders had 
expected 
live cattle futures were 15 cent lower to 05 cent higher with 
december at 7680 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 
25 cent lower with october at 8680 cents a pound live hogs were

competitor federal express corp 
ups has pushed back its guaranteed overnight delivery time to 
1030 am and is offering sameday pickup the company used to 
guarantee delivery by noon and would pick u packages the day 
after a customer called 
both features have helped federal express dominate the 8 
billion overnight delivery market and limit upss customer reach 
we knew that this is what we needed to compete in this 
market said ups spokesman alan caminiti 
now caminiti said the greenwichbased package delivery company 
can compete with federal express in both service and price 
we think when somebodys making a decision and they look at 
all of these factors its going to make the decision for ups 
clear caminiti said 
ups the worlds largest package delivery company sends more 
than 700000 packages a day by air both overnight and secondday 
delivery he said 
paul schlesinger a transportation analyst with donaldson lufkin 
amp jenrette in new york said upss announcement could take the 
competitive edge away from federal express 
federal will either see an erosion in their volume or may have 
to do something on price or both schlesinger said 
ups charges 11 for a sameday overnight letter pickup to 
nonregular customers caminiti said regular customers who receive 
upss 450perweek daily pickup service pay 9 for overnight 
delivery and customers who drop off their overnight letters pay

oil prices were mixed on the futures market this 
morning as uncertain traders tried to figure out which way crude 
would move after mondays record drop 
were having a little bit of confusion down there today 
said thomas blakeslee an energy analyst with pegasus econometric 
group inc in hoboken nj theyre not exactly sure where they 
want to take the market 
light sweet crude oil for december delivery was down 81 cents to 
2960 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange in early 
trading january and february delivery contracts were also lower 
but later months were higher 
todays mixed prices appeared to put at least a temporary halt 
to oils recent rapid decline which resulted in a record fall of 
541 per barrel on monday the big drop came as november contracts 
were traded for the last time and pushed those contracts to 2838 
at the close 
december contracts had not fallen that far on monday because of 
trading limits imposed by the exchange so the spot price of oil 
was actually higher this morning 
the big falls have come as traders determined a peaceful 
solution in the persian gulf seemed more likely than war they have 
stripped away more than half of the war premium that sharply 
pushed up prices to the 40perbarrel range in the weeks following 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
refined petroleum products were also moving in different 
directions today amid the confused trading 
home heating oil was up 337 cents to 7935 cents per gallon on 
november contracts winter and early spring delivery contracts were 
all lower while late spring and summer contracts were higher 
unleaded gasoline was up 420 cents to 8070 cents per gallon on 
november contracts winter and spring delivery contracts were 
trading lower while contracts for next fall were moving up 
earlier today oil prices had moved up more than 1 per barrel 
in london where european traders said some doubts had arisen about 
the markets perception on monday that a negotiated peaceful 
solution was close in the gulf crisis 
the london markets rebound appeared to be a combination of a 
correction from drop on monday of more than 5 a barrel and a 
reassessment of how likely the gulf crisis is to be resolved 
peacefully 
prices just went down too fast over the past couple of 
trading sessions one london trader said 
traders said that comments by saudi arabian government 
officials including king fahd suggesting that the kingdom hasnt 
abandoned its hardline position against iraq helped turn the 
market around oils big plunge on monday was largely attributed to 
comments from another ranking saudi official that were seen as an 
indication iraq might be able to keep some kuwaiti territory in a 
negotiated settlement 
traders in new york said that despite the later saudi 
statements it would likely take a renewed threat of war to push 
prices up very far

eastman kodak co is bringing its new 
photographic compact disc to desktop computer publishing with hopes 
the new technology will catch on with those who want to produce 
splashy documents with full color pictures and graphics 
kodak announced today a line of products and standards that will 
tie the cds to the desktop publishing systems that have mushroomed 
in popularity in recent years the announcement came a month after 
kodak unveiled a system that stores photographs electronically on 
cds and displays them on television screens 
kodak said it is teaming with a number of leading computer and 
software companies including international business machines 
corp apple computer inc and adobe systems inc to help 
popularize the system 
kodak also announced a 1500 color printer to be used to make 
paper copies of the photographs and text from ibm and apple 
computers and compatible models 
we see desktop color imaging to be a whole new industry 
said john p white an executive at the rochesterbased company who 
is in charge of the new products 
white said monday the new desktop publishing system is the 
commercial version of the photo cd system announced in september 
in that amateur photographers would have their film developed and 
the images put on cds by professional photo finishers 
the photo cd system wont be available until 1992 kodak 
apparently wanted to announce the software and other aspects of the 
commercial system in advance to get the computer industry prepared 
for the technology said david nelson an analyst at shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
kodak also announced it has developed a standard for how colors 
are represented in digital form or the ones and zeros of computer 
language that is how photos and other data are stored on cds and 
in computer memory the standard is a mathematical representation 
of the colors 
establishing a standard is necessary step to ensure that an 
electronically stored photograph will have the same colors no 
matter what printer is used or on what computer screen it is 
displayed experts say 
its something thats technical but having the right colors 
is very very important nelson said 
with current technology color reproduction varies so greatly 
from printer to printer that what appears as yellow on one machine 
could look more like brown on another said john warnock chairman 
and chief executive of adobe 
this has been a huge problem said warnock whose companys 
postscript software established an industry standard for how 
printers print out pages of documents 
by providing a standard for how colors are represented 
electronically kodak should help lower costs in the electronic use 
of color photographs nelson said 
and lower cost attracts new products and new software which 
makes color publishing easier to perform he said 
kodak said the standard along with software it will offer 
called color management tools also will ensure that the color 
shown on a computer screen will be identical to the one printed out 
on a printer under todays technology that is not always the case 
kodak said its colorstandard system is the first such 
specification for highresolution color than spans the computer 
broadcast and print media 
digitized color photographs require vast amounts of computer 
storage space by putting this digital data on cds which have a 
large storage capacity kodak says it has eliminated another 
roadblock to greater use of color photos in computer software 
in addition it says the photo cd technology provides 
higherresolution images than traditional scanning devices used to 
change photographs into computer code 
kodak developed the photo cd technology in conjunction with nv 
philips the dutch electronics giant 
kodak estimates the market for desktop color imaging will reach 
5 billion by 1995 including hardware and software products

senate sponsors are launching a longshot 
effort to override president bushs veto of a major civil rights 
bill which he says would encourage hiring quotas 
but the bills house sponsor rep augustus f hawkins 
dcalif acknowledged monday that a new push for civil rights 
legislation likely will have to wait until next year 
when the chips are down the white house is against civil 
rights sen edward m kennedy dmass said following the veto 
he called the action tragic and disgraceful 
i deeply regret having to take this action bush said in his 
veto message however he said the measure would leave employers so 
vulnerable to discrimination suits they would hire by quota in 
selfdefense 
we think well win an override vote white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said today he said he hoped congress would 
consider bushs alternate civil rights proposal if not well do 
it next session he said 
senate sponsors were shooting for a vote as early as wednesday 
to override the presidents veto and pass the bill over his 
objections the timing of the vote still was uncertain 
hawkins said he would not seek a house override vote unless he 
was certain it would succeed im just not going to waste any 
more time he said noting ive been assured the bill will be 
introduced as soon as congress meets next year 
the bill was passed by the senate 6234 and by the house 
273154 strong majorities but not reaching the twothirds 
required to override a veto 
the measure the civil rights communitys top priority in 
congress would overturn six job bias decisions handed down by the 
supreme court last year 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme cases of 
discrimination 
the sharpest clashes however have come over provisions that 
would make it easier to win discrimination cases against employers 
bush said the temptation to support a bill any bill simply 
because its title includes the words civil rights is very strong 
but when our efforts however wellintentioned result in 
quotas equal opportunity is not advanced but thwarted he said 
in his veto message the very commitment to justice and equality 
that is offered as the reason why this bill should be signed 
requires me to veto it 
the president said the bill actually employs a maze of highly 
legalistic language to introduce the destructive force of quotas 
into our nations employment system under the measure he said 
employers will be driven to adopt quotas in order to avoid 
liability 
civil rights supporters scoffed at that argument its pure 
poppycock said ralph g neas executive director of the 
leadership conference on civil rights the bill has nothing to do 
with quotas 
the presidents veto and his repeated efforts to pin the 
false label of quotas on this legislation are part of a 
disreputable tactic to appeal to public resentment and prejudice 
neas said 
bush called on lawmakers to enact his version of the measure 
before they quit for the year probably later this week however 
that appeared unlikely as bushs critics said his proposal would 
weaken current law 
civil rights advocates denounced the presidents proposal as a 
sham for permitting challenged hiring practices to stand if they 
could be justified on such grounds as customer relations such 
justifications they said were used to support the 
separatebutequal jim crow laws of the first half of the 20th 
century that kept blacks in segregation 
the white house plan would cap at 150000 the total damages an 
employee could win in a job discrimination suit as passed the 
bill would allow unlimited compensatory damages in some cases and 
cap punitive damages at 150000 or the total of compensatory 
damages plus back pay whichever is greater 
sen paul simon dill said the presidents decision is 
disturbing and difficult to understand he added that during 
negotiations on the measure we often got the impression the 
white house staff was looking for excuses not to support this bill 
rather than for ways to achieve a fair bill and a meaningful bill 
today that impression is all the stronger

italys auto giant fiat faced with a sales 
slump will lay off 70000 workers for a week in late november 
twice the number originally planned the company said tuesday 
a spokesman for the turinbased group said the temporary layoffs 
were designed to cut car production by 90000 units by the end of 
1990 
auto sales in italy dropped 75 percent in september from a year 
earlier 
but fiat sources indicated that despite a recent slowdown in the 
domestic market 1990 is expected to be a positive year for fiat 
with more than 2 million cars produced 
the layoffs were announced for the plants at mirafiori atese 
termini imerese chivasso pomigliano darco and cassino 
the highly automated cassino plant produces the tipo and tempra 
models 
workers laid off will get about 90 percent of their salaries 
through a special state fund 
despite the announcement fiat shares closed higher on the milan 
market at 6609 lire tuesday from 6544 the previous day 
some brokers speculated that the strength was mostly due to 
expectations that a longexpected announcement of a joint venture 
or commercial agreement with the us group chrysler may be coming 
soon

the only satisfactory outcome of world 
tradeliberalizing talks is major cuts in government farm supports 
the official overseeing the crisisridden talks said on tuesday 
arthur dunkel director general of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade told a german audience that pressures for reform 
are growing from all sides and will not be held back by 
finetuning current policies or by tinkering at the margins of the 
problem 
dunkel urged a comprehensive reform program extended over a 
reasonable period of time including cuts in border restrictions 
and in domestic supports and export subsidies 
his speech seemed designed to put pressure on the european 
community the only major group failing to meet an oct 15 deadline 
for offering farm support cuts in gatt and on germany which most 
strongly opposes concessions 
divided european ministers have failed several times to agree on 
a proposed common position and the rift over agriculture supports 
is threatening to derail the wideranging 4yearold talks 
ministers from some 100 nations are scheduled to sign a package 
deal cutting trade barriers in 15 areas in early december 
dunkel at a gathering of the ueberseeclub in hamburg appealed 
to newly unified germany to shoulder its responsibilities 
saying its economic power depends on an open world trade system 
also monday a us negotiator reiterated washingtons stand 
that only substantial farm trade reform can save the entire gatt 
talks from collapse 
deputy trade representative julius katz said on a satellite 
interview program with european journalists that the farm talks are 
stalled and we have not yet had one serious day of negotiations 
on agriculture

soybean futures prices closed higher tuesday on 
the chicago board of trade in a late technically inspired rally 
that helped boost corn prices wheat futures finished narrowly 
mixed 
soybean futures bounced back after the november contract failed 
to penetrate a threeweek low of 605 a bushel 
the fact that it held there spurred shortcovering toward the 
end of the day and thats what rallied us into the close said 
anne frick senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc 
shortcovering occurs when traders buy back contracts that they 
previously sold on expectations the market would fall 
corn futures drew additional support from indications the soviet 
union is preparing to buy more foreign grain 
analysts said harvest pressure on the corn and soybean markets 
is beginning to ease now that the harvest has passed the halfway 
point 
at the close wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in december at 263 a 
bushel corn was cent to 1 cents higher with december at 231 
a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cents lower with december at 
124 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 6 cents higher with

japans economy dizzied by a 2 trillion loss on 
the tokyo stock exchange over nine months seems to have landed 
squarely on its feet 
by most accounts consumers have shrugged off the vanished 
assets as easy comeeasy go 
a leading think tanks gross national product projection for 
fiscal 1990 actually was revised upward earlier this month to 48 
percent economic growth from 46 percent retail sales in septembr 
rose from a year ago with luxury purchases leading the list 
and tokyos notoriously high land prices the bellwether most 
look to for recessionary signs show little slippage 
the average japanese family has over 11 million yen about 
85000 in the bank said mark yim senior analyst at baring 
securities they have so much wealth anyway the decline doesnt 
matter that much 
however the selling spree that nearly halved the 225share 
nikkei stock average from a peak of 3891587 in december to above 
25000 this fall has put a strain on some corporations who have 
had to cope with big paper losses 
most of the markets stock is held by large japanese 
corporations and banks businesses with huge cash surpluses had fed 
the fiveyear stock boom preceding the fall 
but higher interest rates the primary cause of the slump and 
corporate paper losses is putting a crimp in investment some 
economic slowdown is expected although not a recession 
by early last week the nikkei index stood at around 25300 
points following several consecutive gains some analysts however 
have said it could sink as low as 16000 before the growth 
bubble swelled by japans liquid wealth finally deflates 
completely 
whatever the bottom the slumps suddenness has helped mark 
tokyos rite of passage from a clubby protected market designed to 
engineer japans postwar regrowth to more of a westernstyle 
financial freeforall analysts say 
one sign has been a fraying of the tight corporate ties and 
rigid government control that as recently as a decade ago made 
japans financial markets nearly impenetrable to foreigners 
the tokyo stock market was once considered stable partly because 
a majority of stocks were never traded corporate shares were 
crossheld by large institutional investors such as banks 
whose stocks in turn sat in the permanent accounts of other huge 
corporations all had an unspoken agreement to weather the 
volatilities of the market 
but banks battered by high interest rates were forced to sell 
corporate stock to maintain income levels the companies 
reciprocated by dumping the bank stock 
as a result since the beginning of the year the share prices 
of japans top 21 regional banks have fallen by more than 50 
percent according to paul heaton senior research analyst at w i 
carr 
its a case of enough is enough heaton said you dont 
mind holding stock if it falls 15 percent but if other 
companies with which youve maintained a business relationship sell 
your stock youre going to wonder whats the purpose of holding 
theirs especially in an era when bonds are better 
many such relationships nurtured in postwar years when capital 
was scarce had become inefficient and unprofitable anyway 
analysts say 
this kind of slump gives banks and large companies a 
convenient excuse to really go for globalization said kuniko 
inoguchi a political economist at sophia university now they 
can try what they have had in mind for the last two years or so to 
go beyond the traditional structure of crossshareholding and 
closed business practices 
with the growth of japan into the worlds premier banking 
nation theres greater opportunity abroad than in traditional 
commitments she said and theyve discovered they can win the 
global competition 
encouraging these changes have been the twin levers of financial 
deregulation and foreign participation since the mid1980s new 
instruments such as futures trading in government bonds and stock 
indexes as well as a loosening of notoriously low uniform 
interest rates on some deposits and money funds have helped pry 
oen the black box of japanese finance 
the number of foreign members on the exchange has grown to more 
than 20 since 1986 when they were first allowed 
the tokyo stock market has grown transparent said warwick 
jones a vice president at merrill lynch japan in the future it 
may look a lot more like other markets 
analysts say deregulation particularly in interest rates was 
largely responsible for the unprecedented price fluctuations seen 
during the market slide the recent drop in us stock prices had 
been precipitated by panic selling spurred by daily reports of the 
persian gulf crisis or economic worries 
higher interest rates tend to make bonds and money market 
instruments more attractive triggering a flight from stocks 
the rate increases are themselves a symptom of japans 
continuing economic expansion now in its fourth year and the 
governments need to tamp down the resulting inflationary 
pressures 
the bank of japan has raised its benchmark discount rate or the 
interest charged to member banks five times since last may to the 
current 6 percent that touched off higher market rates already 
aggravated by a worldwide capital shortage stemming from investment 
demand in eastern europe and the us budget deficit 
its quite rational said toshio suzuki a top executive at 
nomura research institute 
the ministry of finance traditionally as protective of the 
market as a finicky mother hen plans no further stablization 
measures beyond several that produced a record oneday surge oct 
2 said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
what we see at the moment is a gradual stabilization he

united parcel service said tuesday its moving 
headfirst into the overnight delivery market bringing heavy 
competition to overnight leader federal express corp 
ups the worlds largest package delivery company announced 
this week two services that match federal express guaranteed 
1030 am delivery of overnight packages and sameday pickup 
with both companies touting their reliability and delivery 
expertise the big difference appears to be price 
the average shipper pays 11 for ups to pick up and deliver an 
overnight envelope federal express charges 1550 for the same 
service if a customer drops off the envelope a ups facility it 
costs 850 for overnight delivery at federal express its 13 
the ups move is aimed directly at those customers who took their 
overnight business to federal express because it was faster said 
alan caminiti a spokesman for the greenwich connbased company 
ups used to offer delivery by noon and couldnt pick up a package 
until the day after a customer called 
we knew that this is what we needed to compete in this 
market caminiti said 
so far federal express is unfazed 
theyre basically playing catchup said spokeswoman shirlee 
finley whose memphis tennbased company opened the doors to 
overnight delivery in 1979 and added 1030 am delivery in 1983 
we founded the market and pretty well set the industry 
standards she said its not surprising that once again our 
competitors have followed the lead 
federal express doesnt plan to lower its prices she said and 
isnt worried about losing customers to ups 
but analysts said that might just be wishful thinking 
federal will either see an erosion in their volume or may have 
to do something on price or both said paul schlesinger a 
transportation analyst with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
any competition will have some impact on federal express 
results said john e hilton an analyst with argus research 
corp while at this point the impact is not quantifiable we do 
expect it to crimp federal express earnings growth rate 
slightly 
finley said federal express which delivers about 15 million 
packages a day commands 40 percent to 50 percent of the 8 billion 
overnight delivery market ups which began overnight delivery

walt disney co said tuesday it formed a 
film production financing partnership worth at least 600 million 
backed largely by japanese investors 
for five years disney has limited its filmmaking risk along 
with its potential profits by raising about 1 billion through 
limited partnerships mainly with us investors 
the last of those silver screen iv will conclude as planned 
disney said then the new partnership touchwood pacific partners 
i will become the main source of finance for all liveaction films 
at disneys three studios disney touchstone and hollywood 
pictures 
the whole film business has been becoming more global said 
disney spokesman erwin okun and frankly the japanese provided 
better terms 
the deal is another example of hollywoods allure for the 
japanese last year sony corp bought columbia pictures 
entertainment inc for 34 billion and victor co of japan agreed 
to invest 100 million in largo entertainment a film company 
headed by former 20th century fox president lawrence gordon 
recently mca inc has been talking with matsushita electric 
industrial co about a buyout worth as much as 86 billion 
and just last month disney reached an agreement for a unit of 
nomura securities to provide up to 200 million in financing over 
four years for movies made for disney by interscope an independent 
production company 
the latest disney deal marks the largest infusion yet of 
japanese money into a major hollywood studio short of acquisition 
touchwood pacific is a us partnership its 600 million 
financing however will be based on 180 million raised from 
japanese investors who buy limited partnerships through an 
affiliate of yamaichi securities a leading japanese securities 
firm 
in addition to that equity another 420 million will take the 
form of a line of credit from a consortium of banks led by 
citicorps citibank banks involved include the fuji bank ltd the 
longterm credit bank of japan ltd and manufacturers hanover trust 
co 
disney touchstone and hollywood pictures together plan to 
produce about 25 films a year the average film costs about 25 
million to produce and nearly that much to promote and distribute 
the wall street journal in a report on the financing tuesday 
quoted some industry observers as saying the transaction would be 
the largest single such financing in hollywood history and that the 
final figure could be closer to 1 billion

a un official tuesday proposed a 
moratorium on debt ollection from those countries hit hardest by 
the persian gulf crisis 
prospects for the developing countries as a whole are 
worsening because of the slowdown in the growth of industrial 
countries economies the increase in interest rates and the rise 
in the price of oil said bettino craxi the former italian 
premier and un special representative on debt 
the gulf conflict he told the general assemblys second 
committee which deals with economics is likely to produce 
increased poverty and environmental degradation 
the rise in oil prices caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait will 
cripple the weak economies of eastern europe and the 
nonoilproducing third world countries according to a un study 
craxi said the oil price hike will cause a stagnating or 
negative growth rate for many african countries and will produce 
major new debtors among lowincome south asian nations which so 
far have escaped serious debt problems 
eastern european nations will suffer severe balanceofpayment 
problems and foreign aid will be reduced to highly indebted 
countries that export oil such as mexico and nigeria 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar appointed craxi last 
december as his special representative on the debt problem which 
is retarding development in almost half the countries of the world 
it is estimated that if prices vary between 30 and 40 a 
barrel in 1991 the oilimporting developing countries will be 
facing an oil import bill ranging between 45 billion to 60 
billion said rafeeuddin ahmed the undersecretarygeneral for 
international economic and social affairs 
for many of these countries this will be an unbearable 
additional burden he said 
some developing countries those that produce oil will reap 
additional billions from the price hikes ahmeds report says 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
excluding iraq and kuwait which are under a un economic embargo 
will gain 88 billion in windfall revenues if the price stays at 
30 per barrel the opec winners are algeria ecuador gabon 
indonesia iran libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united 
arab emirates and venezuela 
iran alone would gain 98 billion in additional revenues 
nonopec oilexporting countries would gain 146 billion those 
countries are angola brunei china colombia egypt malaysia 
mexico oman syria trinidad and tobago tunisia yemen and a 
handful of minor exporters 
the poor third world countries without oil resources hoped the 
oil producers would share some of their wealth but so far no 
formal steps toward that goal have been taken 
kuwaits governmentinexile and egypt however are considering 
asking the general assembly to urge wealthy nations to share their 
windfall with the impoverished countries 
subsaharan africa will be one of the regions devastated by 
the oil price hike un officials say 
consumption of oil in the region is expected to fall by about 30 
percent smashing an economy that is 70 percent dependent on oil 
for its productive output 
the oil cutbacks will cause power stations factories and mines 
to close slowing growth and further eroding living standards 
eastern europe once depended on cheap oil from the soviet union 
but with the breakup of the eastern bloc the soviets now sell 
their oil at market prices even to their former client states 
us president george bush has said he will push the world bank 
to arrange loans worth 5 billion to assist eastern europe 
but several nations there have already appealed to the security 
councils sanctions committee for relief citing cumulative losses 
that nerly equal that amount 
most latin american nations already burdened by a crushing 
foreign debt will also see their economies staggered by the oil 
price shock among the south american countries with significant 
extra costs are brazil and chile

in a break with the dogged optimism of the 
american bankers association convention comptroller of the 
currency robert l clarke tuesday chastised the industry fr 
bringing upon itself a decline in public confidence 
clarke the nations top bank regulator told the aba the 
industrys reputation is at its lowest level in 50 years 
bankers dont have a reservoir of public goodwill from which 
to draw clarke said this is a harsh assessment but this 
is not a time to be kidding ourselves 
the aba meeting is taking place as the industry grapples with a 
slumping economy anxiety over loan losses and political fallout 
from the savings and loan crisis but banking leaders have 
maintained that the industry overall is strong and able to 
withstand the current downslide 
clarke suggested the industry will have further difficulties if 
it does not shore up its standing with the general public and 
legislators 
your public image is likely to determine the outcome of 
legislative debates next year on the future of banking he said 
clarke said many bankers have lost sight of basics such as sound 
lending practices diversification of risks and longterm vision 
recent experience has again brought home the lesson that there 
is no substitute for following the fundamentals clarke said 
but as bankings current reputation proves profound damage 
occurs from the failure to follow it 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman who 
followed clarke on the aba agenda gave the convention a somewhat 
more hopeful view 
but seidman told reporters later he agreed with clarke 
i think everything mr clarke said was true seidman said 
i cannot erase from my mind president carters malaise speech 
the question to me is whether too much emphasis on the down side 
doesnt tend to depress us all but i dont disagree with anything 
he said 
in his speech seidman said the federal deposit insurance fund 
is capable now of covering any forseeable bank losses and remaining 
solvent 
but further erosion of the economy could change that he said 
your bank insurance fund is under stress and unfortunately i 
cannot report that any improvement is likely in the near future 
said seidman who is in the final year of his term as fdic 
chairman 
you may think that we at the fdic have the most pressing 
interest in seeing the insurance fund remain sound but thats not 
true it is you the good bankers who will pay if we cant succeed 
in dealing with our losses seidman said 
the bush administration has predicted that bank failures will 
reduce the fdics commercial bank fund by more than 6 billion over 
the next three years 
clarke said banking is at a crucial crossroads and is dealing 
from a position of weakness 
he said there are those in washington who feel there is nothing 
sacred about banking and would not hesitate to let the industry 
fall by the wayside 
that element clarke said argues that with the exception of 
federal deposit insurance other financial institutions now offer 
every service that once was the exclusive province of banking 
to maintain the existing banking system he said the industry 
needs a combination of legislation making it more competitive and 
regulations that provide less opportunity for banks to get into 
trouble

thirdquarter profit of 248 million or 646 a share on tuesday 
with nearly all of it due to a onetime 234 million gain from a 
pensionfund change

transport aircraft program which resulted in a onetime charge of 
93 million to cover the elimination of previously reported 
earnings dating back to 1985 
mcdonnell douglas the nations largest defense contractor now 
estimates it wont make any money on the 6 billion c17 project 
which is scheduled for a first flight in june of next year and 
completion in 1994 
backing out the unusual items these earnings were 
surprisingly stronger than expected said howard rubel a stock 
analyst for cj lawrence in new york the c17 is a 
disappointment but hopefully this is a clearthedecks approach 
and lets go from here 
the big gain involving the pension fund came after mcdonnell 
douglas executives decided to dissolve the companys plan covering 
14000 retired salaried employees and replace it with an annuity 
sold by metropolitan life insurance co 
without the two unusual items the company would have reported a 
profit of 72 million or 187 a share in the quarter in last 
years third quarter mcdonnell douglas had a profit of 38 
million or 98 cents a share 
sales in the quarter were 417 billion up 12 percent from 
370 billion for the same period a year ago 
mcdonnell douglas headquartered in st louis makes aircraft 
for the air force the navy and the marines as well as missiles 
and space systems the company is also the secondbiggest maker of 
commercial aircraft 
there was continued improvement in the operation of all of our 
businesses said john mcdonnell chairman and chief executive 
officer for most of them the third quarter was better than the 
second and the second was better than the first and our results to 
date this year are far better than last year 
all of the companys businesses had improved profits during the 
quarter ended sept 30 except the transport aircraft division 
based in long beach calif which is still racking up losses 
last year the transport division underwent a major 
reorganization but still ended up with a loss of 222 million for 
the year in the most recent quarter the transport segment had a 
loss of 98 million 
for the first nine months mcdonnell douglas had a profit of 
307 million or 800 a share compared with 159 million or 
416 a share for the same period in 1989 
sales were 1212 billion vs 1029 billion for the same period

a bank has moved to force the troubled british 
congomerate polly peck international plc into bankruptcy 
proceedings the bankruptcy court said tuesday 
the national bank of canada filed a petition with the london 
court on monday against the food and electronics conglomerate 
which has been suffering a severe liquidity freeze the court said 
the petition effectively asked the court to place the company in 
receivership so that its assets can be liquidated to meet debt 
payments 
a hearing was scheduled for dec 12 
bankers speculated that the national bank of canadas move was 
designed to set out its claims against polly peck in the event of a 
rush by creditors the hearing falls more than a month after a 
debtpayment standstill agreement between polly peck and its key 
lenders expires nov 9 
a polly peck spokesman declined to comment on the filing and 
officials at national bank of canadas london branch office werent 
immediately available to comment 
polly peck needs about 100 million pounds the equivalent of 
194 million in shortterm financing to get it through its 
liquidity squeeze sources have said 
asil nadir polly pecks chairman and chief executive has been 
visiting turkey and northern cyprus in search of financial support 
polly pecks troubles began sept 20 when it suspended trading 
in its shares on londons stock exchange after the collapse of its 
stock price

company associated with nadir british press reports have said the

coastal corp has received 
permission from the us government to import as much as 26 
million barrels of iraqi crude oil 
but the company must obtain permission from the saudi arabian 
government to bring the lightgrade oil to corpus christi said 
company spokesman jim bailey 
the saudi government opposes the release of the oil worth about 
75 million and is hesitant to make exceptions to the united 
nations embargo which prohibits trade with iraq and kuwait bailey 
said monday 
coastal claims it should be allowed to purchase the oil because 
it was exported from iraq to saudi arabia through a pipeline in 
july before iraq invaded kuwait 
the company must reach an agreement with the saudis by the end 
of the month because the treasury department permit requires the 
oil to be delivered to the united states by dec 15 and oil 
shipments from the middle east take about 45 days to reach the gulf 
coast 
the company would pay for the oil through an escrow account that 
would allow access by the us government but not the iraqis 
bailey said 
none of the money would go to the iraqis he said it is 
in the best interest of the united states because we could use the 
crude 
the light crude would allow his company to make fuel for the 
military bailey said 
it is really in the best interest of saudi arabia as well 
he added 
the us customs service seized a shipload of iraqi crude at the 
port of corpus christi only two days after the aug 2 invasion the 
479000 barrels were to be refined at coastals refinery here 
customs officials released the oil the next day after 
determining it was bought before the embargo was implemented 
britain has granted coastal a waiver to import the oil because 
coastals trading subsidiary is headquartered in bermuda a british 
colony bailey said

the dollar traded mostly higher against other 
major currencies tuesday rising most strongly against the japanese 
yen after the federal reserve sold yen to buy dollars traders 
said 
gold prices rose on the new york commodity exchange gold 
climbed 160 to close at 37120 an ounce later republic 
national bank in new york quoted gold at 37125 an ounce up 
175 at 4 pm edt 
traders said the fed sold an undetermined amount of yen for 
dollars apparently at the request of a customer such as another 
central bank traders said the sale was not believed to be an 
attempt by the fed to affect the value of the dollar against the 
yen 
however greg scarola a trader with painewebber international 
ltd said the sale apparently contributed to the dollars strong 
showing against the japanese currency 
but john mccarthy chief currency dealer for amsterdam rotterdam 
bank in new york said the dollar had firmed against the yen in 
overseas trading before the new york market opened and the feds 
purchase of dollars with yen might have had little effect on the 
market 
to boost the value of the dollar the fed often buys the currency 
with other currencies in order to decrease the amount of dollars in 
circulation 
the dollar rose against several other major currencies as well 
mccarthy said the dollar managed to shrug off what otherwise might 
have been bad news for the currency including growing signs of a 
peaceful resolution to the iraqi standoff he said the dollar was 
boosted by technical factors 
in tokyo the dollar rose to a closing 12713 japanese yen from 
12625 yen monday later in london it rose to 12745 yen in new 
york the dollar settled at 12815 yen up from 12602 late monday

rjr nabisco inc reported improved thirdquarter 
results tuesday showing reduced losses following the food and 
tobacco conglomerates 25 billion leveraged buyout 
rjr nabisco recorded a loss of 86 million down 81 percent from 
a 447 million loss in the same period a year earlier 
the company said its operating income rose 56 percent to 706 
million from 452 million in the third quarter of 1989 while its 
revenue rose to 353 billion from nearly 3 billion the previous 
year 
the firm also reported its cash flow the key figure for 
companies paying down high debt levels at 886 million for the 
quarter 
the companys interest expenses fell to 845 million from 983 
million 
rjr nabisco went private in early 1989 in the largest 
debtfinanced buyout and corporate acquisition ever since then 
the company like other firms saddled with billions of dollars in 
liabilities has been watched closely to see whether it could 
generate enough earnings to pay down its debts 
analysts said tuesday they were pleased with the companys 
performance although some of the numbers were skewed by several 
onetime items 
for instance the companys results in the latest quarter were 
boosted by a 108 million gain from rjr nabiscos purchase of junk 
bonds the buyback is part of a recapitalization announced earlier 
this year 
rjr nabiscos tobacco operating income rose more than 51 percent 
to 683 million from 451 million in the third quarter of 1989 the 
gain was due in part to an inventory reduction program that 
depressed thirdquarter 1989 tobacco sales 
tobacco revenue rose to 211 billion in the latest quarter from 
155 billion in the 1989 period 
despite such extraordinary items rjr nabiscos results were 
very good and slightly better than expected said becky barfield 
an analyst with first boston corp who described rjr nabisco as 
on track to slightly ahead of itsggoals 
jack maxwell an analyst with wheat first securities inc in 
richmond va called rjr nabiscos results excellent and said of 
its cash flow for the quarter thats really fantastic 
rjr nabisco said earnings from its food business rose nearly 6 
percent to 197 million from 186 million a year earlier 
food revenue fell to 142 billion from 145 billion in 
thirdquarter 1989 the yearearlier results included sales from 
rjr nabiscos baby ruth and butterfinger candy business and its 
chun king oriental foods business which were later sold 
for the first nine months of the year rjr nabisco reported a 
loss of 416 million down from 101 billion in the same period of 
1989 
operating income during the period was up 46 percent to 204 
billion from 140 billion and revenue rose to 1019 billion from 
923 billion 
under the recapitalization announced last summer rjr nabisco is 
retiring a large part of the 6 billion in junk bonds used to take 
the firm private kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which arranged the 
buyout gave the food and tobacco a 17 billion equity infusion 
and negotiated bank loans to pay for the repurchase of the bonds 
by lowering its debt rjr nabisco is reducing its interest 
expenses and making itself less vulnerable to the problems that 
have handicapped other highlyleveraged firms in recent years 
rjr nabiscos tobacco brands produced by its rj reynolds 
tobacco units include winston salem and camel its food products 
are manufactured by nabisco brands inc and planters lifesavers co 
and include oreo cookies ritz crackers and planters nuts

copper futures prices surged tuesday on new yorks commodity 
exchange in a powerful rally ignited by fading recession fears and 
fanned by computergenerated buying 
on other commodity markets platinum led the precious metals 
higher oil futures were mixed grains and soybeans were mixed and 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher 
copper futures settled 355 cents to 52 cents higher with the 
contract for spot delivery at 1322 a pound 
the rally marked coppers fourth straight daily advance after 
the spot price touched a threemonth low of 12315 last wednesday 
analysts said the recent decline reflected pessimism about the 
economy and perceptions that industrial demand for copper would 
slacken in a recession 
but recession fears have eased as oil prices have fallen and 
many speculators who sold copper futures in anticipation of a 
further decline bought back those contracts tuesday after signs of 
trade buying surfaced analysts said 
people started thinking the slowdown might not be as bad as 
formerly thought and demand for copper might not be as adversely 
impacted said bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with 
painewebber inc 
analysts said buying interest also was fueled by the london 
metal exchanges weekly report on warehouse stocks of copper which 
showed an unexpectedly large decline of 5075 metric tons to 
192424 
the rise in prices triggered largescale buying by speculative 
funds whose trading decisions are based on computerized analysis of 
price charts and other market information analysts said 
platinum futures rose sharply for the fifth straight day on the 
new york mercantile exchange like copper platinum prices fell 
dramatically when recession fears were on the rise 
in addition to a letup in recession worries some people are 
thinking that with oil prices breaking like they have recently we 
could see some moderation of interest rates which might be 
supportive said william oneill of merrill lynch 
platinum settled 990 to 1010 higher with october at 42240 
a troy ounce 
on the commodity exchange gold futures ended 150 to 160 
higher with october at 37120 a troy ounce silver was 24 cents 
to 25 cents higher with october at 4219 a troy ounce 
nearterm crude oil futures remained below 30 a barrel on the 
new york mercantile exchange 
the selling was prompted in part by the release of 14 americans 
in iraq prompting further speculation that a peaceful resolution 
to the persian gulf crisis is near 
futures prices of refined products finished broadly mixed with 
nearterm deliveries up sharply after mondays dramatic plunge in 
gasoline and heating oil 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 104 lower to 72 cents 
higher with december at 2937 a barrel heating oil was 383 cents 
lower to 508 cents higher with november at 8106 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 313 cents lower to 34 cents higher with 
november at 7990 cents a gallon 
soybean futures rose moderately on the chicago board of trade in 
a late technicaly inspired rally that helped boost corn prices 
wheat futures finished narrowly mixed 
soybean futures bounced back after the november contract failed 
to penetrate a threeweek low of 605 a bushel 
wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to cent higher with 
december at 263 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents higher with 
december at 231 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cents lower 
with december at 124 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 8 cents 
higher with november at 614 a bushel 
strong cash markets took precedence over mondays bearish 
government cattleonfeed report to lift most cattle futures prices 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
the buying interest spilled over into pork complex which also 
drew support from a bullish government report on frozen porkbelly 
stocks 
live cattle futures settled 10 cent lower to 57 cent higher 
with december at 7732 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged 
to 43 cent higher with october at 8717 cents a pound live hogs 
were 10 cent to 45 cent higher with december at 5420 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 85 cent to 123 cents higher with 
february at 6685 cents a pound

the house banking committee voted tuesday to 
trim the bush administrations request for as much as 57 billion 
more for the savings and loan bailout to 10 billion 
both democrats and republicans on the panel suggested that 
congress should deny more money for the bailout in view of 
president bushs assertion a year ago that never again would 
taxpayers be tapped for it and treasury secretary nicholas bradys 
refusal to testify why that has changed 
but warned by regulators the bailouts total costs might swell 
another 250 million to 300 million in the next three months 
without the funds the committee approved just enough money to keep 
the program going through february 
the approval by voice vote sets a spending ceiling for money 
that must be provided in a separate appropriations bill 
administration officials had warned for months the 50 billion 
that bush sought and got from congress a year ago would not be 
enough and brady suggested over the summer another 40 billion to 
80 billion might be needed 
however the administration never submitted a formal request for 
the money until brady wrote the chthe 11th hour subjected to the 
old squeeze play 
the committees chairman rep henry gonzalez dtexas said 
further money to keep the bailout going beyond february will not 
occur until secretary brady and other officials of the 
administration appear in fulldress oversight hearings 
gonzalez said he had a commitment from house leaders to speed 
the shortterm bill to the house floor where it was expected to 
pass with little debate 
congressional and administration sources speaking on the 
condition of anonymity said they do not expect the senate banking 
committees bill to ever get a vote 
instead they said the senate is expected to attach the house 
version to another bill possibly one toughening penalties for sampl 
fraud through a parliamentary maneuver that would allow senators 
to avoid a recorded rollcall vote on the issue

a consortium of leading computer companies 
oncluding ibm and digital equipment corp unveiled a computer 
software system tuesday they say will make it vastly easier to 
connect various brands of computers 
the group called the open software foundation announced the 
release of its first operating system or the base layer of 
software that controls a computers internal functions 
by agreeing to offer the same operating system on some or all of 
their computers the osf members hope to answer pleas from computer 
users that different brands and types of computers work together 
more easily 
the computer industry is overburdened with operating systems 
some unique to one brand of computer others tied to specific 
computer chips but there is no single operating system that can be 
used on every computer in the market 
that means applications software such as a wordprocessing 
program designed for one type of computer usually cannot be used 
on another type of computer this often forces computer users to 
buy or write different programs for each type of machine they own 
many of our customers have told us that open systems is what 
they want and what they expect said jack kuehler president of 
international business machines corp 
kuehler as well as executives of digital hewlettpackard co 
frances groupe bull simensnixdorf information systems of germany 
and japans hitachi ltd said at an osf news conference that their 
companies would offer the consortiums operating system as an 
option on a number of models 
but however noble the osfs goals its formation was sparked by 
a less magnanimous reason an industry battle over control of 
unix a popular operating system that is the core of osfs new 
software 
unix was developed 21 years ago by american telephone amp 
telegraph co but other companies later devised incompatible 
versions of it 
osf a nonprofit group based in cambridge mass was founded 
two years ago by a group of atampt competitors after they became 
concerned that the phone and computer company was trying to retain 
control of unix development rather than allow it to evolve into 
industry standard 
in response to osf atampt formed a rival industry group called 
unix international inc which includes the nations thirdlargest 
computer maker unisys corp as well as data general corp and sun 
microsystems inc which is 20 percent owned by atampt 
the split over unix obscures the future of osfs operating 
system 
osf and atampts unix operations said last november they were 
discussing a merger to end their division but the talks broke off 
in april after the two sides apparently could not agree on a plan 
to make unix development independent of any manufacturer

wang laboratories inc said tuesday it returned to profitability 
in its mostrecent quarter but two other computer makers control 
data corp and tandy corp said their earnings slipped 
wang said it earned 26 million or 2 cents a share in the 
quarter ended sept 30 compared with a loss of 621 million or 
38 cents a share in the same quarter last year 
revenue in the period which is wangs first fiscal quarter 
totaled 5715 million down from 6048 million a year earlier 
given an extremely difficult industry situation and an adverse 
economic environment we are pleased with these results as further 
evidence that our turnaround programs are working said richard 
w miller chairman and chief executive officer of the lowell 
massbased company 
wang has been attempting to pull out of a slump that has caused 
it to report a string of quarterly losses 
during the most recent quarter the company achieved another 
important milestone by totally eliminating debt to its bank 
group he said this debt was 575 million in august 1989 and 
it is zero today 
wang said it recorded a gain of 118 million during the quarter 
from the transfer of an interest in a real estate subsidiary in 
brussels belgium 
control data corp said it earned 85 million or 20 cents a 
share in the third quarter down 132 percent from 98 million 
or 23 cents a share in 1989s third quarter 
revenue fell 43 percent to 4341 million from 763 million 
last years thirdquarter results included revenue and earnings 
from imprimis a disk drive subsidiary that since has been sold 
and a pretax restructuring gain of 85 million the company said 
the bloomington minnbased company will take decisive 
steps in the fourth quarter to deal with problems at its energy 
management and automated wagering operations according to a 
statement from lawrence perlman president and chief executive 
officer 
empros the energy management division is faced with cost 
overruns on fixedpriced contracts said nancy foltz a company 
spokeswoman the automated wagering unit is considering a writeoff 
in connection with the suspension in the united kingdom of a 
betting game operated by one of its customers foltz said 
control data did not estimate the size of a potential writeoff 
or say how much the overruns at empros will cost 
the effects could be substantial in relation to earnings 
generated by the rest of the companys operations the company 
said 
for the first nine months of the year control data said it 
earned 265 million or 62 cents a share compared with a loss of 
484 million or 1151 a share in the same period last year 
revenue totaled 126 billion down from 241 billion 
tandy said it earned 522 million or 65 cents a share in the 
quarter ended sept 30 down from 628 million or 73 cents a 
share in the same quarter last year 
revenue at the fort worth texas company totaled 109 billion 
up 11 percent over 986 million in the same period last year which 
is tandys first fiscal quarter 
tandy a computer manufacturer and operator of the radio shack 
electronics stores blamed the lower earnings on price cuts of its 
products 
given the uncertain retail environment in the wake of the 
middle east crisis we began to clear radio shacks inventories of 
certain discontinued consumer items and computer models prior to 
the holiday selling season said john v roach chairman and 
chief executive 
clearance sales of these discontinued items were strong and 
negatively influenced gross margin and earnings he said in a

three of the largest oil companies blamed persian gulf turmoil 
tuesday for depressing thirdquarter earnings while another said 
the resulting oilprice jump gave it mixed results and two more 
said profits rose fivefold 
the decreased earnings reported by mobil corp shell oil co 
and sun co and the mixed performance by texaco inc contradicted 
what they called the popular belief that big oil companies have 
cynically exploited the spectacular jump in crude prices stemming 
from iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
it is ironic that at the time the public perceived the oil 
industry was profiteering and price gouging our oil products 
business lost 64 million in net income in the two months following 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait said shell president frank h 
richardson 
conversely amerada hess corp profited immensely from trading 
in oilprice futures and diamond shamrock inc benefited from a 
major revaluation of its crude oil and refined product inventories 
which rose enormously in value because of the persian gulf crisis 
oil prices went from about 21 a barrel before iraqs invasion 
of kuwait to as high as 41 on a usled embargo of iraqi crude 
and fears that a war would disrupt supplies from a crucial 
production region 
at the same time prices for gasoline and other refined products 
shot up but not nearly as much as crude 
this means companies primarily involved in extracting petroleum 
or speculating in petroleum have done well but companies heavily 
reliant on the downstream refining end of the business have 
been hurt because theyve had to absorb some of the higher crude 
costs without passing them on to consumers
