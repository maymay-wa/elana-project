the government will file new charges 
accusing sen juan ponce enrile of participating in decembers 
failed coup an official said wednesday 
the move comes a day after the supreme court rejected a previous 
indictment against enrile and 22 others saying the charges were 
legally invalid 
enrile and the others were charged with rebellion combined with 
murder in connection with the dec 19 coup attempt that left 113 
people dead and more than 600 wounded 
on tuesday chief justice marcelo fernan said the supreme court 
voted 112 against reviewing a 1956 court decision thereby 
overturning the combined charges two justices were absent or 
abstained fernan said 
presidential press secretary tomas gomez said the government had 
enough evidence to charge enrile with the lesser charge of 
rebellion murder is punishable by life imprisonment but rebellion 
carries a prison sentence of six to 12 years 
the quality of the evidence has not been diminished 
whatsoever gomez said in a radio interview wednesday the 
government will now file a case based on rebellion 
in 1956 the court ruled that killings occurring during an armed 
uprising should be treated differently than crimes with common 
motives the court said defendants should be charged with rebellion 
and not murder 
defendants in rebellion cases are allowed bail bail is generally 
denied in murder cases 
mrs aquinos legal adviser adolfo azcuna said the government 
may seek reconsideration in the philippines supreme court rulings 
become final after 10 days during which parties to the case can ask 
for reconsideration 
in editorials wednesday several newspapers accused mrs aquino 
of poor judgment in charging enrile with the combined offense 
the daily globe published by mrs aquinos former speechwriter 
teodoro locsin said the government had lost and lost miserably 
sen john osmena said the ruling meant the governments attempt 
to bend the law to intimidate those who do not agree with the 
administration has been foiled 
after the vote enrile said i think the supreme court 
although the members are all appointees of president aquino remains 
faithful to their role as guardians of liberty i am happy for the 
country 
enrile a former defense minister was arrested in february the 
supreme court released him on bail two weeks later pending a 
decision on the validity of the charge 
enrile has denied any role in the uprising enrile played a key 
role in the 1986 military mutiny that triggered the people power 
revolution that propelled mrs aquino to power 
enrile was fired in november 1986 after a failed coup by his 
followers

feinsteins bid for the democratic nomination for governor marked 
the first serious attempt by a woman to win californias chief job 
a fact that overshadowed most other issues in her race against van 
de kamp a less telegenic but politically wellconnected prosecutor 
abortion was a major issue for all of the major candidates to 
succeed retiring republican george deukmejian as governor even 
though all three were prochoice 
feinstein and van de kamp competed over who was the most 
effective champion of a womans right to choose the limited 
opposition raised in the gop primary against wilson a moderate 
republican who never touted his prochoice stand came from 
antiabortion activists 
norma mccorvey the jane roe in roe vs wade the us 
supreme court case that established a womans right to an abortion 
made a lastminute campaign appearance for van de kamp 
feinstein campaigned as tough on crime trying to seize an issue 
that seemed more likely to belong to her opponent 
she ran a latecampaign tv ad criticizing van de kamp for 
declining to prosecute a suspect in the hillside strangler case in 
which 10 people were killed van de kamp was the los angeles 
district attorney at the time and the suspect angelo buono was 
later convicted of murder after the state attorney general stepped 
into the case 
van de kamp called the criticism baloney 
the gasoline tax measure proposition 111 marked a political 
turning point for the state 
opponents noted that the measure which would raise 155 billion 
over the next decade would be the largest tax hike in the states 
history supporters warned that defeat of the proposal would bring 
californias highway construction program to a halt during an era of 
the fastest population growth in decades

while other world leaders fight to stay 
in power and some try to fend off reform the head of the worlds 6 
million tibetans has the opposite problem 
the dalai lamas people are uncomfortable with democracy and do 
not want him to retire as their political leader 
but then most other political figures arent considered living 
gods 
i am insisting on stepping down the dalai lama said in an 
interview it is of greatest urgency that democracy comes to us 
it is the most creative way for the human spirit 
in his ornate parlor overlooking the snowcapped himalayas the 
dalai lama predicted communism soon would fall in china and his 
followers would return to their homeland within 10 years 
tibetans believe their mountainous region with its unique 
culture should be an independent nation china claims tibet has 
been part of its territory since the 13th century 
to prepare for their return the dalai lama said tibetans must 
embrace democracy and shed the idea that he is a god 
it is proving difficult there is strong conservative opposition 
to the dalai lamas plans to democratize his governmentinexile and 
few if any tibetans seem willing to abandon the belief that his 
holiness is divine 
that belief has made tibetans lazy said the 54yearold 
buddhist leader who won the 1989 nobel peace prize they think i 
will do everything for them 
tibetans circle his residence pausing to clasp their hands in 
prayer elderly women limping with age climb steep grades to gaze 
at his compound whispering 10000 years to his holiness 
tibetan buddhist tradition holds that the first dalai lama born 
in 1391 was a reincarnation of chenresi the buddhist god of mercy 
subsequent dalai lamas are revered as reincarnations of their 
predecessors 
the current dalai lama the 14th was chosen in 1936 after a 
series of visions indicated the leader would be found in a house 
with turquoise tiles in eastern tibet 
when he first told tibetans of his wish to give up his political 
position the dalai lama said many people were shocked and they 
told me i should not say this kind of thing 
but i continuously spoke out he said with a playful grin 
he remains a reluctant politician a man of the spirit not of 
law or intrigue clothed in maroon and saffron robes and wearing his 
everpresent tinted glasses the dalai lama chuckled cracked jokes 
and reached out to squeeze the hand of a reporter as he made a point 
i am just a tibetan monk he said running his fingers over 
wooden prayer beads i would rather go to an isolated monastery 
and pray now i have no time for prayer i am always busy busy with 
the affairs of this world

a scandal involving money and secrets 
from taiwan has started a fight in the tibetan independemce movement 
that threatens gains made since the dalai lama its leader won the 
nobel peace prize last year 
the scandal has alienated many tibetan refugees causing what one 
young tibetan called a big gap between us and our leaders 
on one side are liberals who favor talks with china and making 
the tibetan movement more democratic the dalai lama spiritual and 
temporal leader of the worlds 6 million tibetans leads this group 
on the other are conservatives who oppose contacts with the 
chinese and attempts to reform the governmentinexile conservative 
buddhist monks and older tibetan officials lead them 
its a little irancontra scandal said tendzin choegyal the 
dalai lamas youngest brother to the average tibetan this is a 
very confusing and troubling time 
tattered wall posters along the road to this retreat in the 
himalayan foothills attest to the problem 
traitors you have sold out tibet they read china lovers 
we will never forget your deeds 
both chinas must be laughing their heads off said an 
editorial in the tibetan review the movements official publication 
the scandal emerged last year when tibetan officials began 
accusing each other of being on taiwans payroll 
it revolves around the mongolian and tibetan affairs commission 
a taiwanese government agency like its communist enemy in beijing 
the government of taiwan claims tibet is part of china and rejects 
tibetan independence 
since 1959 when the dalai lama fled china after an abortive 
uprising and set up headquarters in dharmsala taiwan has donated 
hundreds of millions of dollars to tibetan groups according to 
sonam tobgyal spokesman for the exile government 
he said the taiwanese agency aims to convince tibetans to break 
with the governmentinexile which taiwan denies 
gene jy chang head of the agency said it had given much less 
to the tibetans an average of 300000 a year 
in an interview in taipei chang acknowledged some tibetan 
refugees were antichinese not merely anticommunist but said the 
commission would like to improve its relations with dharmsala 
tobgyal said the commission had become increasingly active in 
recent years financing a tibetanlanguage newspaper in calcutta 
building monasteries in nepal and granting scholarships to tibetan 
students 
the main aim of the money has been to create disharmony among 
tibetans tobgyal said 
he claimed taiwan paid independence activists to return to tibet 
and stir up trouble thus violating the dalai lamas policy of 
nonviolence taiwan denies the charge 
the reasons for taiwans alleged meddling are not clear 
it could seek to foment further political turmoil on the chinese 
mainland by encouraging protests in tibet but also might be 
currying favor with beijing by trying to weaken the tibetan 
movement taiwan recently abandoned its no contact policy toward 
the mainland 
a further complication is the relationship between the security 
agencies of taiwan and the tibetan exile government 
since 1986 dharmsala has provided taiwan with details about 
tibet in exchange for taiwanese intelligence about political changes 
in china tobgyal said he defended the exchange but granted that 
it raised eyebrows among tibetans 
in a speech to his cabinet in january the dalai lama said the 
scandal had caused a loss of faith in the tibetan 
administration he forbade unofficial contacts with taiwan and 
established a committee to investigate previous dealings 
we are wasting the best opportunity we ever had within these 30 
years on minor issues he said 
at risk are gains made since the awarding of the prize focused 
attention on tibet where chinese troops have killed scores of 
proindependence activists in the past two years lhasa tibets 
capital had been under martial law for 13 months when it was lifted 
may 1 
there also is concern that the conservative faction might try to 
take advantage of the disunity and get the dalai lamas concessions 
to china retracted which would scuttle dreams of an early return to 
tibet 
in a 1988 speech the dalai lama said he was willing to give 
china control over tibets foreign affairs and defense in exchange 
for autonomy in internal matters 
the dalai lama recently fired several top officials including 
his representative in tokyo in an attempt to end the crisis he 
dissolved the cabinet and instituted reforms designed to open the 
exile government to public scrutiny 
voting by 368 tibetan representatives from around the world may 
14 in dharmsala filled only three of the seven cabinet seats at 
least nine candidates dropped out and some representatives handed in 
empty ballots to express opposition to the reforms

its raz dva tri strikes youre out at 
moscow state university where soviets were learning the american 
national pastime while president mikhail s gorbachev toured the 
american heartland 
the soviets started playing baseball four years ago hoping to 
field a team at the summer games in 1992 when it will be a medal 
sport for the first time 
but hopes are not high on the astroturf at a 1000seat baseball 
stadium built on the university grounds last september 
i dont think a soviet team will make it to the olympics this 
time around said alexander e semyonov 
the american cuban and nicaraguan teams are much stronger 
said semyonov who calls himself the only soviet baseball 
writer his articles appear in the monthly sport magazine 
the big problem is that we dont have many fans semyonov 
said in an interview monday they dont really understand the 
rules for example they dont know what a ball is or a strike 
in a game sunday about half the seats were empty including 
those directly behind home plate they are considered choice spots 
in us ballparks but shunned by soviets because of the protective 
wire screen fans seem to prefer taking their chances with fly balls 
along the foul line 
otherwise the scene was much the same as at a high school or 
small college ballpark in the united states fans wore the caps of 
their favorite teams the men went shirtless and the women wore 
halter tops and basked in the early summer sun 
it is strictly bringyourown hot dog at moscow stadium which 
has no concessions 
cheers and jeers in russian english and spanish rose from the 
stands as the red devils of the moscow chemicaltechnical institute 
ran up a 102 score against last years national champions the army 
sports club of balashikhov known by its russian acronym ska 
they tried what is called a double play intoned the soviet 
announcer as the ska second baseman handled a toss from the 
shortstop turned the force at the bag then buried his throw to 
first base in the dirt 
the announcer sprawled in the stands wore shorts and a blue 
cap he mixed his commentary with warnings about pop foul balls that 
sailed over a low screen and bounced among cars parked next to the 
stands 
the stadium itself is vulnerable to the pop foul glass skylights 
on either side of home plate sport neat round holes a danger 
apparently not foreseen by contractors 
the ballplayers themselves occupy the semiprofessional gray area 
typical of soviet sports 
they are amateurs and have other jobs but its hard to say 
how hard they work said semyonov 
on the field play alternates between poor fundamentals and 
prowess 
a red devil baserunner on first broke for second and slid just as 
the catchers throw reached the bag but the ska player bobbled the 
ball and it skipped deep into center field allowing the runner to 
take third base 
the next pitch was wild and the runner scored 
a half inning later ska tried the same play the batter missed 
the bunt and the catcher pegged the ball hard to second again the 
throw was too hot and low for the fielder but this time the second 
baseman was backing up and the runner was stranded on second after 
the next out 
so far there are no stars among the 14 teams in soviet baseball 
we dont write about individual players because the level of 
play isnt really high enough yet said semyonov 
the season started early this year in march with the 
championship slated for late june to give the national team time to 
prepare for european competition in italy in august 
the team will consist largely of players from ska and the red 
devils said semyonov and specialists say that if the soviet team 
wins we could advance from group b to group a among the european 
teams

wuer kaixi is haunted by thoughts that he may have 
enticed people to their deaths in central beijing a year ago 
on the evening of june 3 1989 as chinese troops prepared their 
bloody assault to clear tiananmen square of the prodemocracy 
protesters who had occupied it for three weeks wuer appealed to 
the people of beijing for help 
as night fell i thought there werent enough people on the 
square that it was becoming more and more dangerous he recalled 
in an interview exactly one year later 
thinking that numbers would protect the students he rushed about 
the capital for more than four hours that night holding rallies and 
urging people to flock to tiananmen chinas symbolic political 
center 
many people went he said looking back i feel very its 
so difficult to say but i believe many people heard me speak went 
to tiananmen square and were killed 
hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed when soldiers rammed 
their way through beijings streets with tanks to recapture 
tiananmen wuer who collapsed from exhaustion and left the square 
in an ambulance shortly before the soldiers arrived says at least 
3000 died 
wuer was born in beijing and lived there for 16 years before 
attending high school in xinjiang the region in chinas far west 
largely populated by wuers fellow ethnic uygurs 
his proper name is uerkesh daolet wuer kaixi is the chinese 
transliteration of his first name 
it was during his first year back in beijing in a prefreshman 
preparatory course at beijing normal university in 1988 that wuer 
made a name for himself as a cocky but articulate thinker who was 
quick to question authority 
he became head of a confucian study group that started out as a 
forum to discuss his major education but quickly developed into an 
arena for political debate 
i was outspoken i was a headache for the administration a 
troublemaker he says 
he was a troublemaker even to his friends who were trying to slip 
him out of the country after june 4 
i didnt want to leave friends spent a lot of time not so much 
helping me leave china but convincing me to go he recalls 
so many times i said so what if i get caught i get caught 
now however i understand them said wuer now 22 
he left china at the end of june by means he declined to 
describe in detail his name was no 1 on the governments wanted 
list which ensured media attention overseas and within a few weeks 
he was made vice chairman of the fledgling federation for a 
democratic china headquartered in paris 
he scoffs at reports that he embezzled money or is a womanizer 
what bothers me is when the communist partys peoples daily 
says im disliked he says i have lots of friends 
he travels widely and has been invited by the sakharov committee 
in the soviet union to attend a human rights seminar in moscow this 
weekend 
but his top priority remains political reform from within the 
chinese system we have some branch organizations inside china 
even in the army and the most important thing for us is to send 
information to china just hold on and wait for an opportunity that 
opportunity will probably be the death of the old man senior leader 
deng xiaoping 
wuer says the death of deng 85 could trigger new 
demonstrations but he said change will be slow fifty or 100 
years later then probably china will become a democratic china 
on monday the first anniversary of the crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement wuer stood with a group of chinese 
dissidents across from the chinese embassy in paris chastising 
embassy officials for refusing to see them 
all we wanted to do was deliver a letter seeking a dialogue we 
just tried to tell them we still want to go back to china and that 
were not criminals he said 
but they are afraid of us they are afraid of popular peoples 
power thats the truth

a us stuntman was missing tuesday 
after going over niagara falls in a kayak canadian police said 
the red kayak was recovered below horseshoe falls on the canadian 
side all in one piece in fairly good condition all things 
considered said maureen quinn a constable with the niagara parks 
police but she said authorities found nothing else just the 
kayak no bodys been found 
the canadian falls the worlds largest by volume are 181 feet 
high or about as tall as a 13story building 
another constable kim davis said the 28yearold man from 
tennessee was trying to complete a stunt that had been planned for 
about 10 years police said nobody has ever tried to kayak over the 
canadian side of the falls 
barrels yes said quinn of other attempts to go over the 
falls in enclosed capsules and live but she said it doesnt 
seem plausible he could do it and survive 
george bailey of the niagara parks commission said the man had 
attempted the stunt several years ago on the american side of the 
falls but park police stopped him 
he said the man was accompanied by a film crew and a friend who 
took photographs 
quinn said police received a call that the stuntman had entered 
the water about a halfmile above the falls but by the time we 
responded it was too late he actually went over the brink 
she said several people saw him go over it was videotaped 
there were plenty of witnesses 
the man whose identity was not disclosed pending notification of 
next of kin was last seen at about 145 pm edt quinn said 
ken kitchen was working in an ontario hydro tower overlooking the 
niagara river when he saw a man stripped to the waist in a kayak 
he said the utility closed the dam gates reducing the water flow 
to the falls in an attempt to stop him 
the mans boat grounded but he picked it up and moved it into 
the middle of the river kitchen said 
he was gone before our help could get there all we could do 
was sit and watch helplessly kitchen said 
at a press conference later tuesday police showed reporters a 
videotape a tourist made of the incident 
the film shows a man in a kayak successfully negotiating the 
rapids of the niagara river just before the falls then he 
disappears 
its beyond me why anyone would attempt this said george 
bailey of the niagara parks commission he obviously doesnt know 
our falls 
dave munday who went over the falls in a steel barrel three 
years ago said people who try such stunts are usually not aware of 
the dangers of the falls 
a lot of people underestimate whats at the bottom he said 
i did myself its just solid rock down there people dont 
realize that 
bailey said 13 people have intentionally gone over the falls 
most in barrellike structures ten of the 13 survived

help wanted baylor college of 
medicine seeks 16 good sleepers to spend a month lying down salary 
uncertain but benefits include breakfast in bed lunch and dinner 
too 
it sounds like a couch potatos dream but theres a catch to the 
deal being offered by researchers david cardus and wesley mctaggart 
when they say the sleepers will be confined to bed theyre not 
kidding the people they select wont be allowed to get up for the 
the entire month and theyll spend part of their time spinning 
around in a spaceage sleep chamber that looks like something 
straight out of the movie aliens 
the experiments also will require the research subjects to be 
hooked up to sensors that monitor a dozen bodily functions 
other than that the jobs a snooze 
cardus and mctaggart using a 650000 grant from the national 
aeronautics and space administration are involved in a threeyear 
program to see if the physical strain can be eased on astronauts 
making lengthy space voyages 
the reseach is designed to counteract some of the physiological 
effects of weightlessness during space travel a pertinent topic in 
light of the nations plans to establish a permanent space station 
and to send astronauts to mars 
what happens if you stay in bed asks cardus a physiologist 
who has worked with astronauts since the beginning of the nations 
manned space program you get deconditioned and why dont you get 
completely deconditioned because you spend twothirds of the day 
carrying your weight around 
once someone gets into space they dont have any weight to carry 
around their bodies especially the cardiovascular systems get 
deconditioned by weightlessness 
early astronauts sometimes fainted upon their return to earth 
and even now space shuttle crews and cosmonauts on the soviet space 
station must halt their work after a few hours to do exercises to 
keep their muscles in shape he says 
to simulate weightlessness cardus and mctaggart intend to 
decondition their subjects by keeping them off their feet for about 
two weeks 
then for about another two weeks the subjects will be put to 
bed again this time on one of four blowup mattresses that sit 
under plexiglass canopies atop a centrifuge platform 
from time to time the entire platform which fills a 
30by30foot room will turn spinning the four subjects about 20 
times a minute to simulate one g or about the force of earth 
gravity the speed produces a force that travels from the head to 
the feet in a horizontal position 
scientists believe a regular schedule of exposure to oneg or 
more will have the same effect as frequent exercise and theyre 
hopeful that if it works a similar machine could be included on the 
space station or the ship that heads for mars they also want to 
find out if the reconditioning works while the subject is either 
asleep or awake or both 
we think the apparatus will meet its purposes but of course 
you dont know the problems until you start to use it cardus said 
baylor has been advertising for men between ages 20 and 40 who 
have at least a month to spend laying around 
theyve received replies from all over the world but a limited 
budget and the need to retest the subjects periodically after the 
experiment has them looking primarily in the houston area 
so far theyve interviewed about 10 candidates theyd like to 
get 16 subjects four groups of four men 
after the initial 16 cardus says he may try to recruit women 
the physiology of the male and female is a little different 
this individual will be studied in considerable depth and we dont 
want to complicate the experimental design he says but the 
principal reason is this our work is complex enough

eight men who fled cuba in three separate groups on 
inner tubes a small boat and a makeshift raft were plucked from the

all of them were turned over to the us immigration and 
naturalization service raising to 179 the total number of cubans 
completing the dangerous passage across the florida straits this 
year

from miami beach after the cruise ship scandinavian saga spotted 
them drifting on inner tubes about 10 miles northeast of miami at 
1010 am petty officer steve sapp said 
also three cubans who said they left the island 12 days ago were 
spotted in a small skiff by the freighter humacao just off cay sal 
island about 130 miles south of miami and 35 miles north of bahia 
de santa clara cuba 
the coast guard cutter metompkin arrived at the scene at about 
1030 am and took the men to key west 
three more cubans were found in a 10foot raft about seven miles 
east of john pennekamp coral reef state park off key largo at about

south korean president roh taewoo said 
monday that he and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev have agreed 
to end 45 years of cold war animosity by establishing diplomatic 
relations between their countries 
as a result of my meeting with president gorbachev today 
normal bilateral relations between our countries will be restored 
roh said 
the south korean leader said discussions would continue toward 
that end but that no dates had been set 
the gorbachevroh meeting which took place at the end of 
gorbachevs visit to the united states was the first between 
leaders of the two nations since korea was partitioned more than 
four decades ago 
the cold war ice on the korean peninsula now has begun to 
crack roh told reporters 
though nothing was put in writing he said the two countries plan 
to boost economic and trade ties 
the soviet president was more vague in his summation of the 
meeting 
we will let the fruit grow ripe and when the fruit grows ripe 
we will eat it gorbachev told reporters outside the soviet consul 
generals home before departing san francisco for home at the end 
of a fiveday us visit 
korean officials have called friendlier ties with the soviet 
union a cornerstone of the roh administration 
the two countries have had an unstable relationship since the 
formation of south korea at the end of world war ii but the 
hostility began to abate in 1988 when the soviets announced they 
would participate in the seoul olympics 
roh plans to meet with president bush in washington on wednesday 
to brief him on his talk with gorbachev and to discuss the 
ussoviet summit which ended sunday 
north korea became a communist satellite state in 1948 in 1950 
soviet leader josef stalin promised to support north koreas 
invasion of the south an attack that led to three years of war that 
ended with an armistice but no peace treaty 
it is estimated that the soviet union now supplies 70 percent of 
north koreas military supplies including advanced weapons systems 
an improved relationship between the soviet union and south korea 
could benefit the united states by making possible an accelerated 
withdrawal of us troops from south korea the united states 
already has announced plans to withdraw 7000 of its 43000 troops 
during the next two years 
roh met sunday with top us state department officials 
including richard solomon the assistant secretary of state for east 
asian and pacific affairs who briefed him on the gorbachevbush 
summit 
secretary of state george p shultz and former president reagan 
also visited roh on sunday the day he arrived in san francisco

pesky insects

pence and william salter in the death of ed chambers was an 
important county event the men were found innocent by a jury 
comprised of company sympathizers he said 
history buffs had spent years searching for the records lambert 
said 
out of all the records i pulled one suspiciouslooking one 
because it was thicker he said and lo and behold it was the 
lively murder trial 
the aug 21 1921 shooting was part of bloody struggles between 
union workers and coal companies lambert said 
bullet holes from the shootout on the courthouse lawn that left 
chambers dead are still visible on the courthouse he said 
as for the termites lambert said the bug problem seems to be 
solved

declaring that the cold war is now behind 
us soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on monday called for a 
more united world in which american and soviet scientists work 
together to destroy nuclear weapons 
before leaving for moscow about 745 pm pdt monday night the 
soviet leader met with south korean president roh taewoo and roh 
said afterward the two countries agreed to establish diplomatic 
relations 
the 45yearold cold war ice on their relationship now has 
begun to crack roh said 
he said discussions toward a resumption of ties would continue 
but no date was set gorbachev speaking briefly with reporters 
summarized the meeting by saying we will let the fruit grow ripe 
and when the fruit grows ripe we will eat it 
it was the first meeting between leaders of the two countries 
which have never established diplomatic relations since korea was 
divided between victorious us and soviet forces who liberated the 
peninsula from japanese rule at the end of world war ii 
in the last hours of his visit to the united states gorbachev 
also continued his courtship of business telling top west coast 
executives he would speed up plans to make the soviet ruble a 
convertible currency helping foreign companies take their profits 
out of his country 
gorbachev said moscow wants to overcome the reluctance of western 
executives who hold back from investing in the soviet union because 
they dont have enough control of their assets 
in an afternoon speech at stanford university gorbachev said the 
soviet union and united states should be partners in building the 
future though he acknowledged that while the two societies are 
coming closer they probably will never be fully alike there is 
no need for that 
he implored scientists in both countries to join in determining 
how nuclear weapons could be destroyed without harming people or the 
environment 
he also advocated a system of international alliances that unites 
rather than divides the world 
the cold war is now behind us let us not wrangle over who won 
it the soviet leader told the cheering audience 
gorbachev called for a new approach to the structures of 
security and alliance building that would result in a unity 
worthy of the life of a human being 
earlier in the day gorbachev paused for a sentimental reunion 
with former president reagan who met him five times in four years 
to help thaw the icy relations between the cold war adversaries 
reagan said afterward that gorbachev wants the same kind of 
solution we all want to the soviet unions problems now 
complicated by economic crisis secessionist drives by the baltic 
republics ethnic strife and growing political instability in the 
russian heartland 
he knows we both are together in trying to increase the 
closeness of our two countries the 79yearold reagan told 
reporters 
mrs reagan whose stiff and sometimes frosty meetings with mrs 
gorbachev were a recurrent subplot at the superpower summits said 
after a private coffee with the soviet first lady there has been a 
great misunderstanding about our relationship 
it was a very different time mrs reagan said we were 
plowing new ground 
gorbachevs message to american business first expressed in a 
speech sunday in minneapolis was a soviet version of the us 
politicians warning that the train is leaving the station and those 
who dont climb aboard now are going to miss it 
we are now watching those who maybe are risking something he 
reiterated monday afternoon and we are watching those who stand 
on the sidelines 
on sunday in minneapolis he told a gathering of corporate 
luminaries those who are with us at this time have a good 
prospect of cooperation in our great country in our great market 
because of its tremendous potential but those who just stand on the 
sidelines who do not want to risk who want to wait and see who 
dont want to risk their dollars well they will remain i think 
observers for years to come well make sure that that is so 
the soviet president suggested to the california business leaders 
that the us air and space industry could benefit from increased 
cooperation specifically mentioning the soviets energiya rockets 
capable of lifting twice the payload of us rockets they could be 
used to put large satellites or pieces of a us space station into 
orbit 
he also said the vast and largely untapped natural resources of 
the soviet far east are open to development with the aid of foreign 
investors and welcomed a proposal that a private ussoviet 
commission be established to help plan for the future 
the gorbachevroh session was boosted as a major event by the 
south koreans who are eager to establish ties with former 
communistbloc countries now seen as a promising new market for 
south korean exports but the soviet side still sensitive to the 
effect on its longtime communist client in north korea played down 
talk of a gettogether refusing for days even to confirm a meeting 
would take place 
south koreas incredible economic success story has been watched 
with envy by soviet planners who if they cant emulate the asian 
nations rapid growth would at least like to expand trade ties in 
hopes of acquiring sorely needed technology and consumer goods at 
relatively low cost

the center for international security and 
arms control at stanford university is looking forward to more 
frequent exchanges with the soviet union following praise from 
mikhail s gorbachev 
in a speech monday at stanford the soviet president noted the 
contributions toward world peace made by the center and by 
university scientists 
it was a very nice surprise we certainly didnt program that 
i can tell you center spokeswoman rosemary hamertonkelly said 
his whole speech means it will be easier for stanford to pursue 
any type of cooperation with the soviet union 
it was the first formal recognition of the center by the soviet 
leader said hamertonkelly assistant to the institutes director 
the center has made frequent exchanges with soviet academics 
however and last year was visited by marshal sergei akhromeyev a 
chief soviet adviser on arms control she said 
the center established in its present form in 1983 and operated 
under the political science department evolved out of an arms 
control program developed at stanford in 1970 hamertonkelly said 
we do research and teach in the field of ussoviet relations 
international security more broadly and we have a practical 
emphasis on the asianpacific region she said 
the institute has in the past studied former president reagans 
strategic defense initiative and as the thaw in the cold war 
continues is planning to study the transition from a 
defenseoriented to a civilianoriented economy hamertonkelly said 
one part of it is the economic effects it has on the local 
economy but theres another whole aspect she said if you are 
going to cut back your military resources how do you structure the 
forces and also the industry in such a way that would there suddenly 
be a threat that you could gear it up again

conservatives and religious fundamentalists are 
hailing a supreme court ruling they say helps put extracurricular 
prayer back in public schools for students who want to worship 
together 
the decision should send a message to school administrators 
nationally that religious speech on the high school campus is as 
fully protected as any other student speech said jay sekulow an 
atlanta lawyer for christian advocates serving evangelism 
in an 81 ruling monday the justices said public high schools 
generally must allow student prayer groups to meet and worship if 
other student clubs are permitted at school 
such extracurricular prayer meetings do not violate the 
constitutionally required churchstate separation when high school 
religious groups are given the same access accorded such activities 
as chess or scuba diving clubs justice sandra day oconnor said for 
the court justice john paul stevens dissented 
the decision upholds the equal access act of 1984 in which 
congress said public high schools accepting federal aid must not 
discriminate against groups based on the religious political 
philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings 
liberals said the ruling was a pretext for reconsidering 
classroom prayer and could undermine earlier rulings that banned 
such activity 
in other actions monday the court 
ruled 81 in a case from illinois that police undercover agents 
may seek to elicit confessions from jailed suspects without first 
warning them of their right to remain silent or to a lawyers help 
ruled unanimously in a north carolina case that nuclear industry 
whistleblowers who say they were disciplined for complaining 
about lax safety may sue their employers under state personalinjury 
laws 
agreed to study the governments power to lift price controls on 
some natural gas a case that has tens of millions of consumer 
dollars at stake 
said it will decide whether passengers on international flights 
may sue airlines for the emotional distress they allegedly suffer in 
nearcrashes that cause them no physical harm 
the student prayer case stemmed from the refusal of omaha neb 
school officials to approve a christian biblereading club at 
westside high school in 1985 
bridget mergens mayhew the former westside high student whose 
attempt to start the club led to the ruling said she was delighted 
its got to be clear to all school officials that they cant 
discriminate against religion any more she said 
mrs mayhew now 23 said group bible study can be a source of 
strength when youre a kid and youve got all these things coming 
at you drugs or whatever 
beverly lahaye president of concerned women for america a 
conservative activist group also applauded the high court the 
supreme court has ruled against religious apartheid in american high 
schools she said to exclude student religious groups from 
meeting on campus is nothing more than bigoted discrimination 
but atheist activist madalyn murray ohair of austin texas 
called the ruling tragic this a major intrusion of religion into 
our secular public schools she said 
in 1962 mrs ohair filed the lawsuit that led to a supreme 
court ban of schoolsponsored prayers the court has since also 
banned schools from conducting daily bible readings and from posting 
the ten commandments on classroom walls 
john buchanan of the liberal people for the american way said 
the court has opened wide the schoolhouse door to religious study 
and worship leaving impressionable children to assume that such 
clubs are part and parcel of the schoolapproved daily 
instructions 
the national school boards association had called the 1984 law a 
thinly disguised move to return prayer to the public schools 
the administration defended the law as a legitimate attempt to 
protect religious liberty for students 
in her opinion for the court oconnor rejected arguments that 
permitting biblestudy groups will mislead students into believing 
the school endorses religion 
a school that permits a studentinitiated and studentled 
religious club to meet after school just as it permits any other 
student group to do does not convey a message of state approval or 
endorsement of the particular religion she said

the presbyterian church faced with 
potentially bitter battles over abortion and the ordination of 
homosexuals decided monday to wait until next year to tackle the 
issues 
commissioners to the 202nd general assembly of the presbyterian 
church usa voted overwhelmingly monday to postpone until 1991 
action on resolutions dealing with a variety of such issues they 
ranged from a call for the church to withdraw from an abortion 
rights group to a proposal to allow local church bodies to ordain 
homosexuals 
i feel that debate on this matter results in high feelings 
emotion divisiveness said the rev rush otey of the greater 
atlanta presbytery theres a time for the church to speak 
theres a time for the church to be silent 
but representatives of an antiabortion group charged the 
denomination lacked the moral courage to address the issues 
there is a desire to see the issue in a political sense but a 
reluctance to deal with it as a moral issue said terry 
schlossberg executive director of presbyterians prolife 
the assembly voted late monday to take away semiofficial status 
from 21 private church organizations including some of its severest 
liberal and conservative critics 
despite criticism that they were tring to reduce voices of 
dissent within the church nearly 80 percent of the commisioners 
voted to delete a portion of the churchs book of order that gives 
groups such as presbyterians for lesbiangay concerns and 
presbyterians prolife the right to be officially represented at the 
general assembly and church meetings 
the proposal goes to the churchs 177 presbyteries a majority of 
the regional bodies must approve the change for it to take effect 
a task force on sexuality is expected to report on both 
homosexuality and abortion to the 1991 general assembly the church 
supports legalized abortion and opposes the ordination of 
homosexuals 
in other business monday the assembly voted to create a church 
office for the environment and to call for stricter gun control laws 
two of the resolutions which were deferred called for church 
agencies to withdraw from the religious coalition on abortion rights 
and to oppose lateterm abortions where the fetus could survive 
outside the womb 
the church embroiled in a dispute over the distribution of 
sexually explicit literature to a youth meeting by a 
churchrecognized gay caucus also postponed until 1991 a decision 
on whether to allow local church bodies to ordain homsexuals 
the issue of homosexuality heated up in the 29 millionmember 
denomination last summer when presbyterians lesbiangay concerns 
distributed brochures detailing the sexual practices of homosexuals 
to high school and college students attending a church meeting at 
purdue university the brochures discussed both oral and anal sex 
and gave explicit instructions in the use of condoms 
in the resulting uproar several regional church groups 
petitioned the general assemby to deny any official church status to 
the homosexual caucus a vote on the overtures has yet to be 
scheduled 
james d anderson communications secretary for the homosexual 
group said the reaction is an expression of the deepseated 
homophobia in the church 
but he said the calls for condemnation will help his group in the 
long run by raising the issue before the church 
the church has to express its hate its anger its fear its 
revulsion he said thats the only way to cure it 
in approving a 93page document entitled restoring creation for 
ecology and justice commissioners voted to establish a 
denominational office on environmental justice and incorporate 
environmental concerns into worship and preaching education 
programs and community ministries 
church members were asked to be particularly involved in waste 
management recycling and energy conservation programs and landuse 
planning 
the resolution on gun violence called for more effective federal 
laws regulating the manufacture and sale of guns including 
requiring the registration and licensing of gun buyers and owners 
and background checks before guns are sold

as the gorbachev motorcade rolled by 
demonstrators chanted out of the baltic states but a far 
larger crowd intent on seeing the soviet leader countered out of 
the way out of the way 
people have been so much taken by their gorbymania that i dont 
think many are hearing us despaired lithuanianborn algis 
zemaitaitis taking part in the protest at stanford university 
the people have been taken by the charm of gorby 
indeed demonstrators were no match for gorbymania during 
president mikhail s gorbachevs visit monday a beaming gorbachev 
captivated thousands at the university wading into the crowds as 
usual to shake hands and exchange hugs and a few words 
progorbachev tshirts banners signs and cheers of go 
gorby were seen and heard scalpers sold free tickets to a 
gorbachev speech for a reported 1800 the 1700 tickets had been 
distributed by lottery 
ive been in crowds that went to see nixon and kennedy and ive 
never seen anything like this said john brigham a political 
science professor at the university of massachusetts who was 
visiting the san francisco bay area this is more like celebrity 
government you can feel people are pulled toward gorbachev in some 
way 
hundreds waving flags and signs staged demonstrations demanding 
independence for the baltic states or raising ethnic grievances and 
complaints of humanrights abuses but the protesters werent sure 
they were getting through 
the american public is so in love with gorby they are not 
paying attention said vazken mousesian 58 who is of armenian 
descent 
before entering an auditorium to deliver a speech gorbachev 
worked the crowd behind police lines 
he was definitely just a real person he was leading the 
pack hoping his bodyguards could keep up said alex levy a 
21yearold political science major 
before the soviet leader arrived capitalism flourished on 
campus jeff vierling 19 and marlowe johnson 21 sat on a curb 
asking for serious offers of 1000 or more in cash for each of 
their two tickets to gorbachevs speech 
the tickets are worth a great deal to me but the only value 
here is sentimental i can probably see him better on tv said 
johnson an international relations major who wants to take a trip 
to europe 
earlier monday prolithuanian groups held a protest at the 
golden gate bridge then moved to the san francisco home of the 
soviet consul general where mikhail and raisa gorbachev had 
breakfast with former president reagan and his wife nancy 
about 100 cambodian exiles also staked out the consul generals 
house demanding an end to soviet aid to cambodias provietnamese 
communist government 
the lithuanian independence group hoisted an oversized lithuanian 
flag and a banner that read to hell with gorbachev butcher of 
afghanistan 
protesters said president bushs support for possible 
mostfavorednation trading status for the soviet union suggested 
lack of interest in the baltic issue 
we have to be tough we got to this point being tough of 
course even reagan isnt tough any more said protester west

in a sign of the cold wars thaw officials say 
the united states may lend the soviet union a technological hand to 
destroy thousands of tons of chemical weapons 
as recently as three years ago the soviets had not acknowledged 
having any such weapons 
an agreement signed by president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev last friday requires both sides to begin 
destroying their arsenals of deadly gases by 1992 questions remain 
though about how the soviets will carry it out 
the kremlin decided last summer to bow to pressure from domestic 
environmentalists and close a new plant built to destroy chemical 
weapons by incineration the soviets have disclosed no plans for 
building another plant and it remains unclear how they will meet the 
1992 date set in the new agreement 
barry daniel chief spokesman for the arms control and 
disarmament agency which oversaw negotiation of the agreement said 
monday he could not rule out the possibility that the united states 
might agree to destroy the soviets chemicals for them 
he said this carried large legal risks however and it appeared 
more likely that the united states might offer to help build or 
operate a plant on soviet soil 
the bushgorbachev agreement requires the two sides to cooperate 
in developing safe and environmentally sound methods of destroying 
their chemical stockpiles both sides are to have no more than 5000 
tons of weapons by the year 2002 compared with 25000 tons now held 
by the united states and 50000 tons by the soviets 
the united states plans to begin destroying some of its older 
chemical weapons on johnston atoll in the pacific late this year 
well ahead of the schedule set in the chemical agreement daniel 
said 
the johnston atoll plant was built to meet a congressional 
requirement set in 1985 to destroy all existing us chemical 
weapons by 1997 as a condition for approving a pentagon program to 
produce a new generation of chemical arms 
plans call for building other destruction plants at existing 
chemical arms stockpile sites in oregon utah colorado arkansas 
alabama kentucky indiana and maryland 
elisa harris a chemical weapons expert at the brookings 
institution a washington think tank said ussoviet collaboration 
on technical aspects of chemical arms destruction would help moscow 
overcome domestic environmental critics 
they would like to have the american stamp of approval on their 
technology to persuade the critics that destruction can be 
accomplished safely she said 
in recognition of the technical and environmental obstacles 
facing both the united states and the soviet union the new 
agreement gives each side until 1999 to destroy 50 percent of the 
chemicals covered by the accord the remaining amounts would be 
destroyed in the final three years of the agreement 
the soviet procedure for destroying chemical weapons is to 
decompose the active nerve agent by mixing it with alcohol making 
it nontoxic it then is burned the us method skips the 
decomposition step and burns the chemicals in an incinerator that 
heats the agents to 2700 degrees fahrenheit 
the chemicals mainly nerve agents and mustard gases are used in 
a variety of artillery projectiles mortar cartridges land mines 
rockets and gravity bombs 
the use of chemical weapons is outlawed by the 1925 geneva 
protocol signed by 149 nations but there are no international 
limits on possession or production

here are excerpts from soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs address at stanford university on monday 
 
ladies and gentlemen im very pleased that within the framework 
of my state visit to the united states i am here among you within 
the walls of the worldfamous university thank you for your warm 
hospitality 
i think that those who work or study in your university are 
doubly lucky it is in california and california is a special place 
even by international standards 
and im saying this not just by way of a compliment and to say 
pleasant things to the governor of this state who is here with his 
wife i think i am just stating a fact it is said that only five 
countries in the world produce a greater gross output than your 
state the ideas and technologies of tomorrow are born here in 
california california is closely linked economically with europe 
asia and latin america 
so this is a good place to live and for me an appropriate place 
for discussing how the soviet union and the united states have 
positioned themselves on the dividing line between the centuries and 
the eras on the coasts of the pacific described as the 
mediterranean of the future it is appropriate now to ponder the 
destinies of the world since it was here in san francisco the united 
nations was founded precisely 45 years ago 
i think this is symbolic that it is this sunny city that was 
selected as the place where to proclaim the foundation the 
establishment of this organization whose efficiency we all need very 
much 
let us look at the conclusions drawn that time right after the 
horrible war the united nations was set up to include and to 
remove the political economic and social causes of war 
conforming it with the principles of justice and international law 
the united nations was set up to include security and to 
remove the political economic and social causes of war to 
promote relations among nations on the equal rights and 
selfdetermination of peoples with respect for human rights 
it is only now that international politics is really starting to 
adjust itself to these ideologies and principles and all of us felt 
how much we need the united nations if we really are to move the 
world a new world a new kind of relationships in the world in the 
interest of all countries and nations for a long time the pacific 
was a center of confrontations and the arms race nations found 
themselves on the opposite sides of the barricades of ancient 
revolutions but new winds are now blowing the japanese and 
koreans and chinese and other asian peoples have lessons for the 
entire world to learn 
let us think about the future both of us have more than enough 
reasons i am under no illusions regarding the possibility of 
faster convergence of societies and they are quite different for 
many years they were developing in different directions they 
probably will never be fully alike there is no need for that 
the cold war is now behind us let us not wrangle over who won 
it who won the cold war 
there was a time when military procurement orders were 
considered are still considered by some to be the best incentive 
for economic and technological progress in the 1970s santa 
clara county which was the first in percapita military contracts 
began to explore ways of demilitarizing the local economy i hope 
that as sovietamerican relations improve participation in the 
arms race will become a thing of the past not only for your 
beautiful state but both our great powers 
science has played a major role in the arms race science was the 
first to seek out and to look for a way out here we have to 
give credit to the joint efforts of soviet and american scientists 
to which stanford university scientists have made a very substantial 
contribution in their program for the development of the basic 
principles for such concepts as international security and strategic 
stability

americans are cutting down on fatty and 
highcholesterol foods but 61 percent still are overweight 
according to a national survey 
there is no evidence that americans are winning the battle of 
the bulge says a report by prevention magazine based on an annual 
poll conducted by louis harris and associates 
the proportion of adults who are overweight has remained close to 
60 percent since 1983 when the magazine began commissioning the 
polls 
levels of regular strenuous exercise have also remained about the 
same over the past seven years about 35 percent in the latest 
survey said they work up a sweat for at least 20 minutes at least 
three times a week 
the survey of 1250 adults was conducted by telephone nov 6 
through dec 13 last year no margin of error was given 
among the bright spots in preventions report card were continued 
reductions in the number of people eating foods high in fat and 
cholesterol 
half of those polled said they try a lot to avoid eating 
highcholesterol foods like eggs dairy products and fatty meats 
up from 42 percent in 1983 
and 58 percent said they avoid eating too much fat up from 55 
percent in 1983 and 54 percent in 1988 
the evidence is overwhelming that a diet high in fat is a 
major threat to health and longevity and it appears that the public 
is getting that message the magazines report said 
but the survey also found a decline in efforts to get enough 
vitamins and minerals down five percentage points from 1983 to 58 
percent and to avoid sugary foods also down five points from the 
first survey to 46 percent 
among those who are overweight more than half are at least 10 
percent over the recommended weight range for their height and 
build a quarter were within their recommended range and 15 percent 
were underweight 
about 35 percent said they exercise strenuously at least three 
times a week by sex that was 42 percent of the men and 29 percent 
of the women 
the survey found that men were more likely to exercise 
strenuously and frequently while women were found to be more 
nutritionconscious 
the survey also found 
46 percent of respondents said they avoided sugar compared with 
51 percent in 1983 
eating fish twice a week followed the same trend down from 34 
percent in 1985 the first year the question was asked to 28 
percent in the latest poll 
53 percent said they have their cholesterol level checked at 
least once a year 
44 percent of women said they examine their breasts to check for 
possible cancer at least once a month down from 51 percent in 1988 
but up from 37 percent in the first survey 
75 percent have a dental exam at least once a year 
28 percent said they smoked cigarettes down from 30 percent in 
1983 
questions about alcohol and drug use found 91 percent drink 
moderately or not at all and 94 percent never use recreational 
drugs such as marijuana speed and downers

new us contacts with the palestine liberation 
organization following last weeks abortive guerrilla attack along 
the israeli coast reinforced the view of some officials that the 
usplo dialogue may have to be suspended 
the dialogue clearly is in jeopardy a senior administration 
official said monday echoing the view of many in the state 
department about the potential consequences of the raid last week by 
a radical plo faction 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the us 
ambassador to tunisia robert pelletreau has met three times in 
tunis with plo representatives since the raid took place 
the united states is demanding that the plo dissociate itself 
from the attack and condemn it as well it also is asking the plo to 
expel the faction responsible for the raid the palestine liberation 
front 
secretary of state james a baker iii said last friday the 
administration was dissatisfied with the responses it has received 
thus far from plo chairman yasser arafat 
the officials said little has changed since baker made that 
statement but the administration is still withholding a final 
decision on whether the dialogue should be allowed to continue 
meantime palestinian sources in baghdad iraq said arafat has 
summoned the plos ruling body to discuss the status of the usplo 
dialogue 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said plf leader 
mohammed abbas will attend the meeting of the 15member executive 
committee they said arafat also has summoned to baghdad the 
secretarygenerals of all factions within the plo 
the reagan administration agreed to open a dialogue with the plo 
in december 1988 after arafat renounced terrorism the 
administration had said in march the plo was abiding by that 
commitment but the events of last wednesday when two boatloads of 
plf guerrillas were intercepted near tel aviv has produced a 
policy review in washington 
plf members hijacked the italian cruise ship achille lauro in 
october 1985 that incident led to the death of leon klinghoffer an 
american whose two daughters planned to appeal in washington today 
for a suspension of the dialogue with the plo 
arafat seems eager to find a formula that would preserve the 
plous link without alienating hardline grassroots sentiment 
within plo ranks 
meanwhile arab countries at the united nations are seeking ways 
to underscore the international isolation of the united states on 
the arabisraeli conflict 
the united states last week vetoed a un security council 
proposal for a factfinding mission to be sent to the west bank and 
gaza strip to inspect living conditions of palestinians 
the us officials insisting on anonymity said several similar 
proposals may be introduced that probably will leave the 
administration in the uncomfortable position of having to register 
additional vetoes 
the arab countries also are contemplating the possibility of 
convening a un general assembly session in geneva to discuss the 
situation in the occupied territories if such a meeting is held 
the us officials said it probably would produce a resolution 
critical of israel that would be approved by a lopsided margin 
by holding the session in geneva arafat could address the 
gathering if such a meeting were held in new york the 
administration could prevent an arafat appearance by denying him a 
visa

chinese thai and american officials joined attempts 
tuesday to foster progress in peace talks that were stalled on the 
brink of signing a ceasefire in cambodias 11year civil war 
japanese officials said 
thai and cambodian officials said a meeting would be held later 
in the day but it was still not clear whether all four contending 
parties would be present or whether a ceasefire would emerge 
the first session of the talks broke off monday after just 25 
minutes because the khmer rouge the strongest guerrilla group 
opposing the hanoibacked government in phnom penh refused to 
attend without the right to raise issues and sign the truce pact as 
an equal partner 
a flurry of diplomatic activity focused on the 16th floor of the 
imperial hotel where prince norodom sihanouk and other members of 
his threeparty guerrilla coalition including the khmer rouge 
were staying in rooms along one corridor 
chinese ambassador yang zhenya was seen leaving the corridor a 
japanese foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said a us diplomat had visited the guerrilla 
delegations earlier tuesday the americans identity was not 
immediately known 
thailands deputy prime minister gen chavalit yongchaiyudh a 
key drafter of the proposed ceasefire left the corridor with two 
highranking japanese foreign ministry officials 
it appeared progress was in the air as chavalit replied 
positively when asked if the cambodians had accepted a proposal but 
he left without giving further details 
the peace conference the first in japan since world war ii 
appeared to have collapsed monday when the khmer rouge nominal 
leader khieu samphan boycotted the opening session 
but informal meetings continued mostly in the hotel where the 
guerrilla delegations were staying pressure came from other 
countries including china which backs the khmer rouge the united 
states which backs sihanouk while trying to distance itself from 
the khmer rouges harsh and even genocidal reputation and thailand 
through which arms flow to the rebels 
all four of cambodias warring factions had tentatively agreed to 
a ceasefire before coming to tokyo but the hardline communist 
khmer rouge refused to participate in twosided peace talks between 
the loose guerrilla coalition and the government of premier hun sen 
hun sen has refused to negotiate equally with the khmer rouge or 
allow them an equal role in a future interim government saying that 
might allow them to return to power 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians died during the groups 
197579 brutal rule before vietnam invaded in late 1978 and 
installed the moderate communist hun sen government 
vietnam says it withdrew all its troops in september but there 
are charges that some remain in cambodia 
if a truce were signed it would be the first time the sides 
actually had signed a ceasefire but the draft agreement lacks any 
mechanism to police a truce even if a ceasefire is worked out the 
sides disagree on measures to administer the country before 
elections can be held 
sihanouk who once was king of cambodia has led the 
threefaction guerrilla coalition since 1982 he believes the 
faction must be included in any political arrangement for the 
country saying its disciplined and powerful army would be the best 
guarantee against a return of the vietnamese 
in bangkok sihanouk spokesman roland eng said heavy fighting was 
continuing and guerrilla groups had launched offensives in areas 
around phnom penh cambodias capital 
we are still carrying on normally on the battlefield nobody 
knows what will happen in tokyo so for the time being we will 
continue as normally on the battlefield he said monday

two consumer groups are urging states to 
tighten controls on credit life insurance policies they say are far 
too expensive and unnecessary for most customers 
this is pervasive throughout all segments of the installment 
loan market said stephen brobeck executive director of the 
consumer federation of america credit life insurance is the 
nations worst insurance ripoff 
credit life insurance is sold by banks finance companies auto 
dealers and other lenders to consumers taking out installment loans 
the policies pay off the loan if the borrower dies 
cfa and the national insurance consumer organization released a 
report monday calling on state insurance departments to require 
lenders to return to consumers at least 70 cents in benefits for 
each dollar paid in premiums 
this would force a drastic reduction in price in almost all 
states the report said it said the 1988 benefits payout amounted 
to 43 cents on the dollar the rest went for profits and 
administrative costs 
the two groups also exhorted state insurance departments to 
launch massive education campaigns to let consumers know they dont 
have to buy the insurance when they buy a car sign up for a credit 
card or take out a loan 
in most cases people need life insurance to protect against 
the economic consequences of early death said bob hunter 
president of nico he said a comprehensive life insurance policy 
should be extensive enough to cover unpaid loans 
you shouldnt buy life insurance to cover your credit 
separately hunter said it costs more and does not allow a spouse 
or other survivor to continue making monthly payments the separate 
policy would pay off the loan immediately 
virginia stafford a spokeswoman for the american bankers 
association whose members sell many credit life insurance policies 
said many people do not have comprehensive life insurance policies 
for those customers credit life insurance may represent a good 
deal she said 
stafford said her group does not believe consumers are being 
overcharged but she agreed they should be better educated about 
their choices 
according to the two consumer groups more than 70 million credit 
life insurance policies were in force in 1988 consumers paid 21 
billion in premiums and received 900 million in benefits that year 
some policy holders are unaware they have bought credit life 
insurance others are led to believe they need it to obtain a loan 
and others fall victim to emotional pitches to protect their loved 
ones when they die the report said 
lenders also make it difficult to refuse the insurance by 
building it into the monthly payment the report said necessitating 
a rewrite of the loan papers if the policy is refused customers 
also are no able to find out if the price is fair the report added 
according to the report all states regulate credit life 
insurance but only four maine new york vermont and new jersey 
require payouts at or above the 60 percent recommended by the 
national association of insurance commissioners 
the groups said the severity of overcharges varies from state to 
state with the worst in the southeast and the best prices in the 
northeast 
cfa is a federation of 240 consumer groups with 50 million 
members and calls itself the nations largest consumer advocacy 
group nico says it is the only national consumer group devoted to 
insurance advocacy and education

when is a ussoviet treaty not a treaty when 
its an agreement a convention a protocol a contract a joint 
statement or a memorandum of understanding 
does it make any difference it does to members of congress 
thousands of other officials and hundreds of millions of people 
worldwide who may be affected 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev signed a 
trade agreement often called a treaty though it is not a treaty in 
the strict sense the constitution requires that a treaty be 
approved by twothirds of the senate ever since the senate rejected 
the treaty of versailles at the end of world war i presidents have 
preferred to use simpler executive agreements 
these are put into effect much more easily 
charles maechling a former state department official estimated 
that about 60 treaties which had to take that form are awaiting 
ratification in the senate now sometimes when the president sees 
possible trouble ahead he does not even ask the senate to approve a 
treaty president carter held back the strategic arms limitation 
treaty after soviet troops invaded afghanistan in 1979 
countries with parliamentary systems do not have this kind of 
complication when their executives make major decisions their 
legislators either approve or face the threat of a new election 
congress has required that they review trade agreements if they 
are made with countries that have been under communist rule it was 
busy this week ironing out a constitutional difficulty on the 
procedure such agreements need a simple majority vote in both 
houses 
bush has said he would wait to send congress the agreement with 
the soviets until the supreme soviet has passed a new law allowing 
all its citizens to emigrate more freely 
other accords not subject to the same law often are sent to 
congress anyway influential members might be offended if they were 
not when members of congress are insulted they may hold back the 
funds to carry out agreements 
the executive pretty well has to flash them by congress said 
maechling who has worked on many pacts 
he is now a visiting scholar at the brookings institution a 
private study group on public policy 
an accord between bush and gorbachev on chemical weapons was 
designed to give a push to a pact that will bring a ban by as many 
governments as are willing to sign president sadaq hussein of iraq 
emphasized the importance of that in april when he threatened to 
make the fire eat half of israel chemical weapons are much 
cheaper and easier for third world countries to make than nuclear 
weapons 
the ban will be called a convention which maechling said was 
just a treaty under another name one official suggested that the 
word convention may sound less forbidding but usually calls for 
the same action by the senate as a treaty does 
some accords get negotiated far down the bureaucratic line by 
lowerlevel officials and may not go before congress at all 
back in the 1970s when henry kissinger was secretary of state 
and he was trying to negotiate detente with the soviet union 
somebody he never heard of the chairman of the maritime 
commission i think negotiated an agreement on shipping with the 
soviets maechling said 
kissinger was furious he only found out about it when the 
agreement worked its way up through the bureaucracy 
this time it was announced during gorbachevs visit that 
secretary of state james a baker iii or other officials had 
negotiated among a long series of accords one that opens 42 ports 
in this country and 42 in the soviet union 
the us negotiator was warren g leback a former merchant ship 
captain who holds the title of maritime administrator

kari gellers struggle against crippling 
illness has taught her to savor the simple joys that other 
teenagers often overlook the wonder of a blade of grass sunlight 
glinting on the surf a mothers inexhaustible love

devastating muscle ailment is told in her first achievement as a 
budding playwright a oneact drama that premiered monday at the

1990 young playwrights award from very special arts a nonprofit 
educational affiliate of the kennedy center which provides arts 
programs for the mentally and physically handicapped 
a central figure in miss gellers highly personal play is based 
on her mother karla geller 50 who relived her childhood bout with 
polio when her daughter was stricken with encephalitis a viral 
infection of the brain at the age of 15 
she was an incredible help to me said miss geller a high 
school senior in san clemente calif she was such a role model 
she showed me that i was not alone she didnt once let me know she 
was scared she was so strong throughout that she made me strong 
miss gellers ailment formally known as postencephalitic 
muscular dystonia involved a gradual constriction of her muscles 
that left her hands clenched tightly her neck immobilized and her 
feet bowed and twisted inward 
after three years of painful physical therapy that included 
horseback riding to improve her balance and coordination miss 
gellers handicap is barely noticeable today she walks with leg 
braces and has regained the use of the thumb and forefinger on each 
hand 
she says she hardly notices either unless she tries something 
like piano playing 
i dont let it get in my way she said after receiving her 
award from jean kennedy smith founder of very special arts and a 
hug from sabrina le beauf a star of the cosby show 
miss geller a member of the laguna playhouse youth theater 
plans to enter the california institute of the arts in valencia this 
fall to pursue a drama career 
she said her illness deepened her affection for her mother a 
special education teacher in los angeles who still walks on crutches 
weve always been best friends the daughter said shes 
the most important person in my life its amazing how many things 
we shared the spinal taps the therapy the hospital nurses when i 
wrote the play we sat down and talked for hours about her feelings 
and the events of the past 
her illness taught her to appreciate life more and not to take 
things for granted miss geller said 
i remember the first time i got out of the house she said 
mother and i got salads and went down to the harbor and sat on the 
grass i watched the water sparkling and looked at a blade of grass 
and saw how beautiful it was i appreciated those things finally 
the other young playwrights award winners whose plays also were 
performed monday were janet allard 17 of honolulu for sand 
dragons and karen greco 17 of cranston ri for ritty amp 
jesus came to dinner and enjoyed a plate of borscht

an influential house republican says hell tell 
the white house that heads ought to be rolling at the maritime 
administration for its maintenance of a rusting cargo fleet that 
would be activated in a national emergency 
rep william s broomfield of michigan told maritime officials 
monday that the national defense reserve fleets ships were 
glorified rust buckets and a waste of money 
broomfield expressed his annoyance after the governments top 
maritime executive and a senior navy official defended the fleet at 
a hearing of the house small business subcommittee on regulation 
business opportunities and energy 
broomfield is the ranking republican on the subcommittee but 
more importantly serves as the senior gop member of the house 
foreign affairs committee 
the fleet consists of 331 mostly mothballed vessels including 
72 world war iiera victory ships the maritime administration 
is spending 67 million this fiscal year to provide minimal 
maintenance for the oldest part of the fleet and 89 million for the 
newer 96ship ready reserve portion the agency is requesting 225 
million for the ready reserve in fiscal 1991 
i agree that the outward appearance of many reserve ships is 
poor to a visitor maritime administrator warren g leback 
testified 
but the transportation department official said the working 
machinery is protected by dehumidification the hulls are treated to 
slow deterioration and the ships would be able to sail again as 
they did when last called to service during the vietnam war 
rep ron wyden dore chairman of the subcommittee joined 
broomfield in protesting lebacks upbeat assessment and both 
lawmakers said they would sponsor legislation to have the ships sold 
to us salvage companies 
i wouldnt want to serve on one testified navy cmdr john 
polley who criticized the state of the fleet last year in an 
investigation he conducted for the defense department inspector 
generals office 
broomfield said lebacks defense of the fleet when the cold 
war seems to be ending and the nation faces a staggering budget 
deficit convinces him that heads ought to be rolling at the 
maritime administration he vowed to get to the white house with 
his complaint 
wyden said the taxpayers are getting repeatedly fleeced 
for these maritime cadavers he accused the maritime 
administration of running a subsidy program for foreign salvage 
companies because ships leaving the fleet went to overseas scrap 
yards 
jonathan d kaskin director of the navys strategic sealift 
division told the subcommittee that the pentagon considers the 
fleet a strategic asset because modern container ships cannot carry 
tanks howitzers and other heavy equipment 
he said the navy wants to build the ready reserve to 142 ships by 
1994 but in the meantime must rely on the world war iiera vessels 
because until we get something better this is all weve got 
youre living in nevernever land wyden said 
a recent associated press inspection of some ships in the fleet 
berthed in the james river at fort eustis va revealed rusted and 
broken railings paint peeling all along the exterior and even 
anklehigh grass growing through wooden deck boards 
below decks were mattresses on metal bunk beds dusty lockers 
old mess halls crankstyle telephones huge ovens and steel cooking 
pots 
the 96 vessels in the ready reserve part of the fleet are 
designated to sail on five to 20 days notice an additional 42 are 
so old they will be used as target practice for navy gunners sunk 
to become reefs or traded to salvage companies for newer ships the 
remaining ships are supposed to be seaworthy on 30 to 120 days 
notice 
except for the ready reserve which is spread out across the 
country the reserve fleet is located at fort eustis near norfolk 
at beaumont texas and in suisun bay near san francisco 
leback said the maritime administration was forced to sell its 
disposable ships to foreign rather than us scrap yards because the 
agency has a responsibility to obtain the highest possible return 
on these government assets 
he testified and us salvage industry officials agreed that 
the domestic industry cannot outbid foreign firms because of 
environmental and workplace safety regulations imposed on american 
firms 
the industry representatives said us companies would bid on the 
jobs if a law were passed to require that the work go to domestic 
concerns

allen ginsberg wants a parents group to 
apologize for requesting that high school students have restricted 
access to an anthology of his poems 
the group coalition of concerned minority parents also 
criticized the lack of black authors in the library of north central 
high school 
if my work were taken out of libraries censors would have 
excuses to take out many other basic texts of early black 
cultures ginsberg wrote may 17 in a letter to mmoja ajabu a 
group spokesman 
ginsberg 64 said the group owed him an apology or at least an 
acknowledgment that his work is not in opposition to their ideas 
ajabu said he intends to reply to ginsberg but not apologize he 
said since the book described homosexual activity we felt it 
should be under the instruction of an adult who is aware that it is 
not the norm 
the school decided in november to continue to allow unrestricted 
student access to collected poems 1947 to 1980 an anthology 
recommended for independent study

here are excerpts from soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs address to west coast business leaders monday 
 
i would like to point out that this summit meeting with president 
bush has placed our relations on a new level and i believe this is 
the deepest result of the summit i think this is consistent with 
the wishes of the soviet and american people and with the 
wishes of the entire world community 
without any regret we are saying farewell to the cold war and i 
think and hope that we have entered a long period of peace 
over these days in washington yesterday in the state of 
minnesota and today in san francisco and at stanford ive been able 
to say quite a few things that i wanted to say to the american 
people it is difficult to avoid repeating myself but in such 
situations in a way repetition results in understanding the 
logic of things and therefore i would like to emphasize once again 
our interests here and i believe that is also consistent with the 
interests of the american people 
also speaking of universal values and also the values of islam 
dont be surprised there is one very interesting proverb in the 
islamic tradition which says repetition does not spoil the 
prayer 
of course i cannot say we can be pleased as to the state of our 
economic relations and the scale of our economic relations i 
currently foresee greater activity in this area 
ive been advocating for many years greater economic dependence 
of the soviet union on the united states and of the united states on 
the soviet union it is very difficult to expect that the 
dynamism that we see now for our relations maintains its momentum 
and gains greater impetus i think without progress and economic 
cooperation this would be simply impossible 
now we stand on the threshold of whats called change in the 
history of our country for many years we will be moving toward a 
new format of new economic life we will be basing our economy on 
market principles we will be creating the infrastructure that will 
open up the road to market relations 
we have to decide now in our country about what kind of soviet 
union were going to have in the years to come the combination of 
political reform of our innovations the new distributions of 
functions between legislative and executive political power and 
party a combination of all the other changes under way within the 
overall process of implementing glasnost places our society on a 
whole new level 
i believe that since the soviet union is moving around the path 
of democratization decentralization glasnost greater freedom in 
whole areas i believe that a soviet union of this kind is what 
all of you need 
we are now watching those who maybe are risking something but who 
are willing to cooperate and watching those who are standing on the 
sidelines thinking that those who cooperate with us now will in the 
future obtain more full cooperation in our market 
we are already entering a world of greater trust and greater 
mutual understanding and interaction we now have the trade 
agreement of course that will not be of much practicality right 
now for the period of transition in addressing most difficulties in 
our economy this is not of great practical significance but it is 
of great political importance which i have to think is no less 
meaningful 
american business should now look for ways to enter our market 
look for ways to find new forms of cooperation so that once the 
agreement is ratified they will be able to use all the potential 
inherent in that agreement 
i think the essence of what is happening here with economic 
cooperation between our governments is that we are laying the 
foundations of stable depoliticized and mutual beneficial 
codevelopment 
we are moving also toward convertibility of the ruble we used to 
think that this was rather for the distant future but we now think 
that since we are trying to integrate into the world market and 
become an organic part of the world economy we will have to achieve 
convertibility of the ruble in a shorter period of time 
the soviet far east today has tremendous potential it has 
about onethird of the reserves of important natural resources 
however industry there is not welldeveloped accounting for only 
about 3 percent of the countrys industrial output we want to 
enhance the potential of the soviet far east and to do so would be 
of great value 
we could probably consider joint scientific exploration space 
missions i decided to speak of this exactly here because i know 
that california is active in space projects so i think this is a 
promising area for cooperation between us

you might be worried perhaps generally by the prospects of 
transition into a market economy youre asking youre wondering 
could involvement with the soviet union become a trap could you 
lose money as a result first of all you must be reminded that i am 
a person who does not like adventures im in favor of change but 
i have always battled all adventurers who like to propose 
change some people would like to propose adventuristic approaches 
i think risk is good in politics and business but adventurism is 
bad both in politics and in business 
the current soviet leadership is in favor of profound changes but 
still it fully intends to do that in the careful way i very much 
hope we will find agreement with our people on all that we are 
doing we will continue to move along the path that we have chosen 
because other people understand that this is the path on which we 
must move forward 
you see some unpleasant things you see some debate you see 
there are some opponents of this change of direction that is true 
and its unavoidable of course you can debate whether it is better 
to go to camp david using a helicopter or taking a car it depends 
on what you want on whether you want to see the woods from the 
helicopter or the car but thats not a matter for much debate but 
when you are changing or replacing one model of the economy with 
another model of an economy you have to do it very carefully and 
whats happening shows we are changing in a serious way and not just 
sweeping the yards as you say 
i want to engage in an open honest and serious discussion and i 
certainly dont want to as they say in italy put spaghetti on your 
head 
some people think that we have been changing course all the time 
no we are not changing our course we are on course were on 
track and our overall idea is quite clear we looked at our society 
several years ago and we decided that things could not go on like 
this that our society country has to become more dynamic and needs 
oxygen fresh air 
the important thing now is just to give people a free hand and 
let them be creative on the basis of new economic realities to 
reveal their potential with their initiative and we see that people 
can do a great deal 
we have become closer to the rest of the world people understand 
us better and appreciate us better including the americans and i 
think thats very important the guarantee of our success is the 
powerful process of democratizing our society we cannot turn back 
and although the path that weve chosen is difficult it is 
interesting and is open and i think it is a very promising road

the united states doesnt need a super rocket 
and can rely on its fleet of expendable launch vehicles through the 
end of the century a defense department advisory panel says 
instead of building a heavylift booster the defense science 
board said the military should push two technical approaches that 
hold promise for breakthroughs in rocket technology the 
airbreathing propulsion being developed for the national aerospace 
plane and nuclear engines 
although launching rockets incorporating nuclear devices 
presents emotional and political difficulties the task force review 
leads us to recommend continued investment in this area said the 
report released monday 
the boards finding would in effect leave the soviet union 
unchallenged in heavylift capacity its energia is the worlds most 
powerful rocket capable of putting a 220000pound cargo into low 
earth orbit 
the most powerful cargo carrier used by the united states is the 
space shuttle which can lift 52000 pounds into orbit the biggest 
expendable rocket the titan 4 can carry a 39000pound payload 
in the apollo moon landing program of the late 1960s and early 
1970s the united states used saturn 5 rockets capable of lifting 
310000 pounds of cargo but the assembly lines were shut down when 
that program ended 
the science board said it was uncomfortable with a 1987 national 
security directive signed by president reagan that called for 
development of a heavylift launch vehicle for the antimissile 
strategic defense initiative 
rather than developing a more powerful booster or a new family of 
expendable rockets the report said research should concentrate on 
improving rocket engines 
if the rocket engines are in an advanced state of development 
a launch vehicle can be developed faster than any payload it would 
be required to carry it said 
unless there is a decision to deploy sdi the annual national 
security payload to orbit averages less than 600000 pounds the 
report added individual payloads do not exceed 50000 pounds no 
heavy lift requirement with the possible exception of an experiment 
for sdi is evident 
the national aeronautics and space administration has talked of 
developing a vehicle to be called shuttlec that would substitute 
a cargo canister for the space shuttle orbiter it would be able to 
lift about 150000 pounds and be used to carry construction parts 
for the space station 
the report called also for building a second pad for launching 
titan 4 rockets at vandenberg air force base in california 
the single titan 4 pad at vandenberg is a major risk it 
said payloads to polar orbit can only be launched from the west 
coast and the april 1986 titan 34d accident demonstrated how much 
damage can be done to a launch complex by a booster malfunction

the new grain deal between the united states 
and soviet union is small compared with potential trade in 
agriculture and other farm products that could be developed says a 
food processing executive 
george melnykovich president of the food processing machinery 
and supplies association said monday that the soviets want to use 
the methods americans perfected for distributing food to a large 
nation 
for their own internal stability they need to feed their 
people said melnykovich weve solved the problem 
but the problem american companies have with providing the 
solution to the soviets is money 
the ruble is virtually worthless in world trade and us 
business operates on the philosophy that if you cant get money 
out dont put money in melnykovich said 
he is an organizer of a threeday conference in washington that 
is bringing together 55 soviet ministers to discuss the state of the 
soviet food system and with food companies here 
its an unprecedented meeting between leaders of one us 
industry and top soviet officials said anthony jf oreilly 
chief executive officer of the hj heinz co and conference 
chairman 
we need all types of products said vladilen nikitin the 
soviet equivalent to the us secretary of agriculture 
speaking through an interpreter nikitin said the conference was 
a first step toward getting more us agricultural commodities to 
the soviet union 
he also noted that he would sign an agreement on food processing 
with agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher on wednesday 
he would not say how much the soviets were willing to spend 
we would rather have joint production said nikitin 
americans companies are skittish about that idea because it 
involves high economic risk said melnykovich but he said he 
thought the soviet government would take steps soon to back its 
currency with the guarantees needed to make it usable in world 
commerce 
meanwhile american food companies are taking steps slowly to 
probe the soviet market 
large companies such as pepsico and mcdonalds are making major 
investments in a gamble that the ruble will be convertible 
eventually 
smaller companies that dont have much venture capital are 
looking for other ways to start doing business with the soviets 
we dont have resources on our own to go after the business 
said tom madsen president of key technology inc in walla walla 
wash which makes equipment used in cleaning sorting and inspecting 
fruits and vegetables we can act as subcontracters 
mel jolly of apv crepaco in chicago said his company is 
converting a distillery in the soviet union into a bakery in a 
project being financed by a british firm 
its the ideal threepartner association jolly said the big 
companies invest directly with the soviets with an eye toward future 
benefits the smaller firms hire on with the bigger ones and get 
immediate payment in the currency of their choice 
the soviet delegation also was looking at the conference for 
equipment companies to convert defense plants into food processing 
facilities said melnykovich 
thats their peace dividend he said 
the united states and soviet union have had grain deals since 
1976 but they have been virtually the only significant trade 
between the superpowers 
the latest fiveyear grain agreement signed last friday by 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev had been 
negotiated in march and came as no surprise it replaces a 1983 
agreement that expires dec 31 
under the pact the soviets agreed to annually buy at least 10 
million tons of us grain an increase from the current 9 million 
tons 
soviet grain purchases in most years have exceeded the required 
minimums in 198889 for example sales were more than double the 
specified minimum 
the kremlin will have some greater yeartoyear flexibility under 
the new arrangement by being allowed to choose between wheat and 
feed grains although over the life of the pact the minimums will be 
met officials said 
the soviets will be committed to buying at least 4 million tons 
each of wheat and feed grains however in any one year moscow may 
substitute up to 750000 tons of one commodity for the other 
for the first time the pact includes barley and sorghum as feed 
grains 
additional flexibility also was provided by giving moscow 
automatic permission to buy up to 14 million tons of grain annually 
without further discussion with washington 
the automatic limit under the current pact is 12 million tons 
although the united states has routinely increased that to fit 
soviet needs 
as of may 31 the soviets had bought more than 167 million tons 
of us wheat and corn under the current agreement for delivery this 
year last years sales totaled a record 217 million tons

his net worth was about 432600 
for 1989 bennetts assets ranged from 150002 to 350000

20 1988 he reported having a savings account worth less than 
1001 the former philosophy professor had been chairman of the

the marriage of president carlos 
menem and his wife zulema had the trappings of a fairy tale 
children of syrian immigrants they met during a visit to the old 
country married after a whirlwind courtship and raised a son and 
daughter while menems political star took him from a jail cell to a 
governors mansion to the presidency 
now as they are on the verge of a very public breakup their 
actions are the stuff of soap operas 
mrs menem denounces the father of her children as a 
womanizer and fires political broadsides at her husband menems 
social policies are inhuman she says his economic plan doomed and 
his staff corrupt 
after complaining earlier this year that telephones at the 
presidential residence were tapped mrs menem walked out last 
month menem did the same and has since slept in government offices 
and the apartments of friends 
magazines and newspapers have had a field day covering the story 
with juicy facts and rumors splashed on covers and front pages 
menem is laying legal groundwork to boot mrs menem from the 
residence if she wont leave on her own 
the whole affair is grotesque says menem 59 he usually 
refuses to comment on developments but said i dont know whether 
to get mad or laugh when asked about her claim he has been 
kidnapped by his aides 
mrs menem 46 declined through her press secretary to be 
interviewed on the subject 
residents of this nominally roman catholic nation seem intrigued 
but hardly scandalized by the marital feud menemwatchers say it 
hasnt affected his policies public image or relations with the 
church 
everyone knows their last reconciliation was a political act to 
help him win the election in may 1989 said nolberto fernandez 
editor of the celebrity magazine la revista 
its not a political problem for him said pollster manuel 
mora y araujo thats what she would like it to be but so far she 
hasnt been successful in making it one 
the menems have had a stormy relationship for years both are 
ambitious determined quicktongued and hottempered 
an avid sportsman who races speedboats and rally cars menem has 
made no secret of his attraction to other women mrs menem a 
striking blonde has been linked with other men 
by some accounts their marriage in october 1966 was arranged by 
their moslem parents menem was reported to have been in love with a 
young divorcee he continued to see for years after the wedding 
following the march 1976 coup that toppled president isabel 
peron menem a provincial governor and leading member of the 
populist peronist party was jailed for three years then put under 
house arrest 
the couple did not get together immediately after his release 
when they did they split up again in 1984 a second reconciliation 
at the urging of papal nuncio ubaldo calabresi came four years 
later on the eve of a crucial primary election 
politics not love seems at the heart of their conflict 
she wants a formal political position and he refuses to give 
her one said a peronist official who commented on condition his 
name not be disclosed 
during the election campaign the first ladytobe tried to evoke 
comparisons with evita the wife of juan peron who helped him win 
election as president in 1946 and endeared herself to millions of 
poor argentines with her charitable works menem did not help the 
effort flopped 
mrs menem a moslem who has hinted her husbands conversion to 
catholicism the state religion to which all presidents must adhere 
was something less than an act of faith also said during the 
campaign 
i support carlos menem but i want people to know im not here 
just as a symbol im going to act im going to do things im 
going to work 
during the 11 months of menems presidency mrs menem has raised 
funds for schools and hospitals but while her sister and cousin 
have been appointed to high posts she has not 
asked whether mrs menems connections with labor leader saul 
ubaldini retired army rebel col mohamed ali seineldin and other 
influential critics of her husband eventually might force menem to 
see things her way the peronist official said 
not at all its not just that menem has stood up to tougher 
opponents as much as he never gives anything to anybody 
sometimes he seems to with her hes not even pretending

jim wright expresses little bitterness 
or remorse over his downfall as house speaker after 34 years in 
congress and spends his time a year later with gardening lecturing 
and family 
i didnt get everything done that i wanted to but for three 
and a half decades i was able to apply my wits and my intellect 
and my physical strength to some of the most intractable problems 
and see if i could make them budge wright said 
that was a great gift not many people are given that so why 
shouldnt i feel fortunate he said in a recent interview 
a relaxed suntanned wright 67 reflected on the benefits of his 
resignation which be blames on political enemies as he sat in his 
cluttered fort worth office may 31 exactly a year earlier he gave 
his resignation speech and he formally relinquished the speakers 
post on june 6 1989 
now im home among people whom i know who know me wright 
said i am able to do a lot of things that i denied myself during 
those years when i was trying to be a leader 
wright stepped down after the house ethics committee said he 
violated house rules 69 times involving sales of his book 
reflections of a public man and in business deals with his 
friend george mallick of fort worth 
he is fatalistic about his resignation which came when the 
longtime democratic leader had been speaker for about two years 
there were so many peculiar circumstances that fell together to 
create this jigsaw puzzle out of which there was no escape none of 
them logical none of them to my mind predictable that im 
inclined to think that thats what was supposed to be wright said 
wrights office is cluttered with memorabilia and boxes from 34 
years on capitol hill along with notes for a book he is writing on 
central america wright donated congressional memorabilia to texas 
christian university for a memorial library 
wright said hes happier now than he has been in years his wife 
betty whose job in a company formed by wright and mallick was 
questioned by the ethics committee said there are deeper feelings 
i think that it leaves scars i dont think theres any way to 
get away from it she said 
wright maintained that the ethics charges were falsely brought by 
his enemies and that he never knowingly violated house rules he 
said the behavior of his nemesis republican rep newt gingrich and 
special prosecutor richard phelan amounted to character 
assassination 
and wright also blames the media for a voracious thirst for 
scandal saying reporters never gave him a chance to tell his side 
of the story 
wright assigns scant culpability to himself 
it is altogether possible that i may have been too insistent 
too demanding too firmly determined to achieve the maximum in 
pushing for legislation he said 
wright said he didnt do enough to protect himself once the 
ethics allegations started flying 
i thought i could let the other guy wear brass knuckles if 
he wanted to and i could still win he said maybe thats 
hubris it turned out that it didnt work that way 
nevertheless he insists hes not bitter 
im happy im as busy as i want to be he said 
wright has time for things that had been squeezed out by his busy 
schedule such as having dinner with his wife and spending time with 
his children and grandchildren 
he still works long days writing giving speeches or guest 
lectures at colleges and appearing at fundraisers for fellow 
democrats wright recently attended a gathering for the man who 
filled his house seat pete geren who often seeks his advice 
wright wont criticize tom foley his replacement as speaker 
saying it would be ungracious but he does say the house today 
seems to lack clarity and direction 
as for history wright said he doesnt worry how his life will 
read 
im at peace with myself he said i intend to rest my case 
on the things that i was able to achieve

discovery became the latest space 
shuttle to encounter trouble when a crane yanked one of its payload 
bay doors 
a hydrogen leak somewhere inside columbia has that shuttles 
astronomy mission on hold nasa plans a fueling test wednesday in a 
lastditch attempt to find the leak without having to roll the 
shuttle back to its hangar a move that would mean a months delay 
discovery sustained possible damage monday when a corner of a 
payload bay door was snagged by an overhead bridge which acts as a 
crane nasa spokesman bruce buckingham said the open door flexed 10 
to 12 inches upward then snapped back into position when the bridge 
operator moved back 
there is no visual damage however the orbiter has some very 
critical components that arent meant to be bent buckingham said 
workers were checking for damage to the 60foot door and the bridge 
which enables the door to open and close on earth 
the accident occurred in a hangar while discovery was being 
prepared for its october flight with the ulysses satellite which 
will explore the suns poles 
discovery has been at the hangar since its april flight with the 
hubble space telescope that mission was delayed two weeks by a 
malfunctioning power unit 
columbias flight with the 150 million astro observatory was two 
weeks behind schedule because of cooling system repairs when last 
wednesdays launch was scrubbed 
nasa plans to fill about a tenth of columbias external tank with 
liquid hydrogen to try to duplicate the conditions that existed when 
the leak was detected 
additional sensors will be placed around the 17inchdiameter 
valve where the leak is believed to be the area will be cleared of 
workers during the test hydrogen is highly combustible 
the longer we cant find it the better the chances of moving 
back to the hangar buckingham said right now the chances of 
not moving back are getting slimmer and slimmer

in a dramatic finale to mikhail s 
gorbachevs us tour south koreas president said he and the 
soviet leader agreed to move toward normal relations between their 
two longhostile nations 
the cold war ice on the korean peninsula now has begun to 
crack president roh taewoo told reporters after a historic 
meeting with gorbachev at a san francisco hotel monday evening 
president gorbachev and i share the view that efforts to 
normalize bilateral relations between south korea and the soviet 
union have already been started and will lead to the establishment 
of permanent relations roh said 
the soviet president was more vague in his account of the meeting 
we will let the fruit grow ripe and when the fruit grows ripe 
we will eat it gorbachev said in a brief interview outside the 
soviet consul generals home before flying back to the soviet union 
at the end of a fiveday us visit 
although no date was set for further talks and nothing was put in 
writing the unprecedented meeting appeared to set the stage for 
significant change on the divided peninsula where for four decades 
usallied south korea has confronted sovietallied north korea in 
one of the worlds longestrunning military showdowns 
lee soojung an aide to roh was quoted by korean reporters as 
saying the two leaders agreed to develop full diplomatic relations 
in the notdistant future officials of rohs governing party 
have said since march that such relations would be established by 
years end 
roh said that in their private discussion he and gorbachev 
agreed to further expand economic scientific technical and 
cultural exchanges and cooperation between our two countries 
trade between the soviet union and south korea doubled to 600 
million last year and was expected to surpass 1 billion this year 
south koreas dynamic fastgrowing economy could offer the soviets 
investment and technology intheir quest to develop their own 
resources 
the south korean leader described the talks as the beginning of a 
lasting dialogue 
as a result of my meeting with president gorbachev today 
normal bilateral relations between our countries will be restored 
he said 
the two countries have had an unstable relationship since the 
division of the peninsula and the formation of south korea after 
world war ii in the 195053 korean war the soviets helped supply 
the north koreans whose invasion of the south touched off the 
conflict 
the animosity began to abate in 1988 when the soviets announced 
they would participate in the seoul olympics even though communist 
north korea opted to boycott earlier this year the moscow and 
seoul governments opened consularlevel offices in each others 
capitals 
roh and top aides had arrived sunday morning to prepare for the 
first meeting between leaders of the two nations since the partition 
restored ties with the soviet union have been a cornerstone of 
the roh administration korean officials have said 
roh said he hopes to restore diplomatic ties to north korea and 
induce that country to share the outlook of glasnost or 
openness that gorbachev has instilled in the soviet union 
north korea is no longer our rival or adversary roh said 
it should be our partner in the quest for common prosperity 
south korea has called on the soviet union to urge north korea to 
reduce its offensive military structure 
roh received a string of impressive visitors at his fairmont 
hotel residence after arriving in san francisco including former 
president reagan and former secretary of state george p shultz he 
met early monday with top us state department officials including 
richard solomon assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs who briefed him on the summit meetings between 
gorbachev and president bush in washington last week 
roh is to meet with bush in washington on wednesday to brief him 
on the talks with gorbachev and to discuss more details from last 
weeks summit talks 
in a noisy demonstration outside the fairmont koreanamerican 
protesters complained that improved relations between the soviet 
union and south korea would only contribute to continued separation 
of the two koreas 
if the soviet union forms full diplomatic ties with south korea 
without any change in the current policy and actions of south korea 
and the us it will amount to recognizing the status quo of the 
korean division the group mobilization for peace and 
reunification of korea said in a statement 
an improved sovietsouth korean relationship could lead to an 
accelerated withdrawal of us troops from south korea the united 
states already has announced plans to withdraw 7000 of its 43000 
troops from south korea during the next two years

raisa gorbachev inspected a corner markets 
supply of russian vodka and a fishmongers giant crab after junking 
her planned itinerary in favor of a little peoples diplomacy 
im overwhelmed by this beautiful city the soviet first lady 
said shortly before she and her husband soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev left san francisco for the soviet union on monday 
in the morning mrs gorbachev and nancy reagan renewed old 
acquaintances and anyone expecting a sudden frost by the bay saw 
only warmth 
very nice mrs reagan said afterward 
later after visiting stanford university with her husband mrs 
gorbachev was supposed to go to the residence of the soviet consul 
general and visit the bank of america building to admire the city 
from atop the skyscraper 
instead she took off on her own whirlwind tour of san francisco 
bewildering secret service men public relations staff and reporters 
in the space of an hour her limousine cruised through chinatown 
the financial district fishermans wharf and the marina district 
damaged in last octobers earthquake 
it seems while i was busy in session she was doing the 
sightseeing peoples diplomacy joked her husband 
mrs gorbachevs first stop was in the twin peaks neighborhood 
hea kim who runs the new terrace market with her husband jin kim 
was watching tv coverage of the soviet presidents visit when in 
swept mrs gorbachev 
i didnt know about it at all mrs kim said i was 
surprised 
mrs gorbachev spent about 10 minutes asking about mrs kims 
merchandise 
i think she wanted to know if we carry stolichnaya mrs kim 
said of the popular imported soviet vodka then she looked at the 
smirnoff the kind made in the us 
mrs gorbachev smiled when she learned stolichnaya was the 
stores bestselling brand mrs kim said 
at fishermans wharf joe rosquites who sells crab was saving a 
champion crab for mrs gorbachev as the motorcade approached 
he held up a crustacean and the limousine stopped the door open 
for a moment 
i held a crab up and shook it and she looked at it and her 
face lit up rosquites said i am kind of upset she didnt stop 
though i was looking for a decentsize tip 
elsewhere mrs gorbachev sat in a cable car chatting with the 
driver and an assistant and ringing the bell 
the cable car operator suggested he had a friend who could do 
mrs gorbachevs hairstyle for free the gorbachevs interpreter 
said later 
the limousine also drove through the marina district where 
damage from last years quake can still be seen 
earlier former president reagan and his wife joined the 
gorbachevs for about an hour at the consul generals home and mrs 
reagan later denied suggestions she and mrs gorbachev once were 
uncomfortable with each other 
i think theres been a great misunderstanding about our 
relationship mrs reagan said it was a very different time we 
were plowing new ground 
there was no mention of mrs reagans complaint in her book 
my turn that mrs gorbachev never stopped talking or 
lecturing to be more accurate

apple computer chief john sculley led the 
cheers for mikhail gorbachevs new dogma invest in the soviet union 
now or regret it later 
its a big market out there and i think we all want to be part 
of it sculley said monday after the soviet president implored the 
west coasts business elite to help transform soviet society through 
capital and technology 
if youre sitting on the sidelines and you think you can wait a 
few years just to see how things turn out dont plan on being in 
sculley said 
his remarks echoed gorbachevs at a luncheon at the plush 
fairmont hotel attended by billionaires like mcdonalds heiress 
joan kroc the governors of california oregon washington and 
hawaii and numerous top executives their reviews of gorbachev were 
overwhelmingly positive 
gorbachev said the soviets desperately need investment now and 
will remember those who provide it the transition to a marketbased 
economy will continue if haltingly at times he said and he 
promised to make it easier for western businessmen to function in 
the way to which they are accustomed 
our society our country has to become more dynamic it needs 
oxygen fresh air he said to loud applause 
gorbachev said the soviet union has tempting investment 
opportunities especially in the rich largely untapped natural 
resources in the nations easternmost regions 
he also said california aerospace companies should undertake 
joint ventures to build airplanes and spacecraft with the soviets as 
both sides produce fewer weapons 
richard matzke president of chevron overseas petroleum which 
just struck a deal to study developing the vast tengiz oil field in 
a joint venture with the soviets was impressed by gorbachevs 
commitment to making the ruble convertible into other currencies 
that would remove one of the biggest obstacles to freer trade with 
the west 
he said they intended to move towards the convertibility of the 
ruble faster rather than slower matzke said of course he 
didnt give any specifics about that and we all recognize that its 
a tremendous task for the soviet union 
in minneapolis where gorbachev issued a similar warning to about 
100 business leaders that those who stand on the sidelines will 
remain there for years a businessman said making the ruble 
convertible is critical 
everything is the money problem former control data corp 
chief executive robert price said monday he cant wish it to go 
away he cant and we cant 
many of the executives at the lunch already have struck deals 
with the soviets that would have seemed unusual or impossible not 
long ago giancarlo parrettis pathe communications filmed the sean 
connery spy movie the russia house there one of a spate of 
us movies lured recently by the soviets 
those kinds of ventures have created huge pressures to upgrade 
soviet telephone systems and more work for american telephone amp 
telegraph said rhea g serpan an atampt vice president 
sculley said the foundations of westernstyle business phone 
systems good hotels good airlines are slowly falling into place 
add to that the stability and vision of president gorbachev and 
what he is talking about and i think youve got the makings of what 
can be a very exciting decade for businessmen sculley said 
he cautioned that it will probably take 10 to 20 years to build 
the real sort of entrepreneurial infrastructure that were 
accustomed to but he added those who want to be a part of it 
better start playing now 
sculley said he was surprised at how detailed gorbachev was in 
emphasizing radical economic changes under way in the soviet union 
efforts to help get profits out of the country allowing foreign 
business people to head joint ventures encouraging entrepreneurs 
low tax levels during investment years 
such detail suggests gorbachev is highly knowledgeable about such 
issues and considers them important sculley said

mikhail s gorbachev celebrating the end of 
the cold war embraced former archenemy south korea thrilled 
crowds of ordinary san franciscans won the applause of businessmen 
and then flew home to his own deeply troubled nation 
in a major speech on the last day of a fiveday us visit the 
soviet president proclaimed the cold war is now behind us let us 
not wrangle over who won it 
later monday speaking to leaders of more than 100 major us 
companies the kremlin chief earned praise with promises to speed up 
the exchange of rubles for dollars streamline the soviet 
bureaucracy and turn his land into a new frontier of capitalism 
apple computer inc chairman john sculley said gorbachevs 
presentation also reassured executives wary that the soviet unions 
course depends only on gorbachevs political fortunes 
he has indicated that maybe his personal future is 
uncertain and hes been quite honest about that sculley said 
but i think hes also said hes got to stand up to adventurism 
that he believes in profound change that he is on a steady course 
that he is not going to deviate from that 
in the earlier speech at stanford university where thousands of 
students hailed him with chants of gorby gorby the soviet 
leader touched on global themes advocating a system of 
international alliances that unites rather than divides the world 
an apparent bid for security arrangements broader than the usled 
north atlantic treaty organization 
he called for a new approach to the structures of security 
and alliance building that would result in a unity worthy of 
the life of a human being 
he also implored scientists in both countries to join in 
determining how nuclear weapons could be destroyed without harming 
people or the environment 
it was bravura performance by gorbachev despite his obvious 
fatigue after four days of summitry a dash to minnesota and a 
22hour spin around the san francisco area that featured a brief 
reunion with former president reagan 
the clamor of thousands of protesters armenians lithuanians 
estonians latvians palestinians koreans eritreans from embattled 
ethiopia competed with the cheers of thousands of others crowded 
behind police barriers and craning for a glimpse of gorbachev 
but in all the din and pomp of the long day a historic moment 
occurred quietly behind closed doors when the soviet leader stepped 
into the tower of the posh fairmont hotel and shook hands with south 
korean president roh taewoo 
that simple gesture and the onehour talk that ensued 
symbolically ended 45 years of enmity and heralded a possibly huge 
shift in the political landscape of asia 
gorbachev and roh in agreeing to work toward establishing full 
diplomatic relations put pressure on north korea to reconcile with 
the south and announced to a reluctant japan that the soviets are 
serious about doing business with asia 
as a result of my meeting with president gorbachev today 
normal bilateral relations between our countries will be restored 
roh said the cold war ice on the korean peninsula has now begun 
to crack 
though nothing was put in writing roh said the two countries 
plan to boost economic and trade ties sovietsouth korean trade 
doubled to 600 million in 1989 and is expected to surpass 1 
billion this year 
the soviet president cautious not to offend longtime ally north 
korea was less exuberant in his assessment of the meeting although 
he did not deny rohs interpretation of the importance of the 
discussion 
we will let the fruit grow ripe and when the fruit grows ripe 
we will eat it gorbachev said cryptically at a separate meeting 
with reporters 
he and his wife raisa then wound up their first crosscountry 
us trip and flew home to the soviet union 
the soviet president had business on his mind most of the day in 
san francisco especially when he spoke to the gathering of 
prominent executives 
he acknowledged some early failures of the soviet system to open 
up its markets but declared the country was on an irreversible path 
toward free trade and called for greater cooperation with the united 
states if the current trend toward economic cooperation were to 
falter he said ussoviet relations would suffer 
he also warned us businessmen they could be left behind if they 
are slow to react to the changes in the soviet union 
we are now watching those who maybe are risking something but 
who are willing to cooperate and watching those who are standing on 
the sidelines he said 
american business should now look for ways to enter our market 
look for ways to find new forms of cooperation so that once the 
ussoviet trade agreement is ratified they will be able to use 
all the potential inherent in that agreement

authorities reopened tiananmen square to the 
public today after closing it for four days that coincided with the 
first anniversary of the bloody military suppression of a massive 
prodemocracy movement 
at the same time the foreign ministry issued a serious 
warning to foreign journalists accusing some of collaborating 
with opposition activists involved in illegal antigovernment 
activities 
the warning came after numerous foreign reporters were detained 
or beaten by security forces while covering the anniversary of the 
june 34 1989 army attack that crushed the studentled 
prodemocracy movement 
tiananmen square the focal point of last years sevenweek 
prodemocracy movement had been closed since friday and sealed off 
by armed police to prevent any anniversary commemorations although 
the square was reopened armed police still patrolled adjoining 
streets 
in the university district in northwest beijing that was the 
scene of a daring antigovernment protest on sunday night all was 
quiet 
during the night helmeted police with automatic rifles set up 
roadblocks in the district checking identification papers and 
searching cars they were withdrawn by dawn 
many students had said they wanted to stage demonstrations to pay 
tribute to the hundreds and perhaps thousands of people who were 
slain by the army last june 
but plans for an overnight candlelight vigil a day of fasting 
and even a commemorative march to tiananmen square were abandoned 
after school officials issued stern warnings and convoys of security 
vehicles circled campuses with their lights flashing 
just seeing the convoys terrified me said a peoples 
university sophomore 
on sunday night students at beijing university threw bottles and 
debris at police vehicles patrolling the campus and up to 1000 
students later marched through the campus and held a rally 
at both beijing and qinghua universities there was a sense of 
expectation monday night but nothing happened other than some 
shouting singing and the smashing of beer bottles bottle in 
chinese sounds much like the name of senior leader deng xiaoping 
who approved the crackdown 
the official beijing daily today ran a long frontpage article 
extolling the progress made in the country since the crushing of 
what communist authorities call the counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
its not that the orioles sing and swallows dart everywhere and 
all is praises and appreciation but one year after the baptism of 
blood and fire it seems that spring is very much in the air 
it said 
security in beijing the past three days was the heaviest since 
martial law was lifted in january the few people who attempted 
protests near tiananmen square were quickly arrested 
more than a dozen foreign journalists were either detained 
roughed up or had guns pointed in their faces by police while 
attempting to cover events sunday and monday near tiananmen square 
and the university campuses 
jim munson the beijing bureau chief of canadian tv and president 
of the foreign correspondents club said he was summoned to the 
foreign ministry today for a warning talk about the activities of 
foreign journalists 
liu rucai division chief of the information department told 
munson that a small number of journalists have connections with 
some chinese people who have engineered illegal activities and even 
engage themselves in activities incompatible with their status as 
journalists 
he also accused foreign journalists of entering university 
campuses without authorization and conducting illegal press 
coverage activities according to an excerpted transcript of the 
meeting provided by munson 
liu did not specify what he meant by illegal activities 
involving chinese citizens or foreign journalists 
liu also said any protest by the foreign correspondents club 
presumably about police harassment would be utterly 
unreasonable he warned munson that as head of the foreign 
correspondents group he would be held responsible for any 
consequences arising from a protest 
foreign journalists say the harassment was unprovoked and took 
place in public areas where there are no restrictions on press 
coverage 
us state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler on monday 
expressed displeasure over the harassment of journalists in beijing 
and chinese diplomats in washington were reportedly called in over 
the matter

the absence of marketaffecting news 
participants generally think the us economy is not doing very 
well which should discourage their interest in the dollar however

buy the yen against the dollar either said masato hayashi a

nbc news president michael gartner admitted to 
affiliates that changes he approved in the today show put it in 
a slump but he predicted it will be back on top in the morning 
ratings 
gartner also announced monday the start in january of a 24hour 
nbc news channel for the networks 208 affiliates 
affiliate executives were heading to capitol hill today to seek 
help on cable issues and urge that nbc and its network rivals be 
free from federal bans on financial interests in shows the networks 
dont solely own 
at the start of nbcs annual affiliates convention gartner 
frankly addressed the decline in today ratings since jane pauley 
left as cohost in december 
thats got to be the starting point the willingness to admit 
in this case the obvious said eric bremner of king broadcasting 
in seattle the new chairman of the nbc affiliates board 
i think it was wellreceived he said 
once first in ratings today has been second to abcs good 
morning america for 21 weeks 
its slide started in january after pauleys replacement by 
deborah norville as cohost with bryant gumbel the popular pauley 
who was unhappy with other changes on the show and asked to leave 
had been on today for 13 years 
to get the show moving again gartner brought in a new executive 
producer tom capra and is bringing back former today host joe 
garagiola on june 11 as third cohost 
without mentioning specifics gartner told affiliates that we 
know we screwed up the today show he capra knows what the 
show needs and he knows how to provide it 
now with the dust settled hell make it well make it 
another winner 
garagiola appeared on stage with the today cast and kidded 
with weatherman willard scott 
but the affiliate executives greatest affection was for pauley 
who got a standing ovation 
i have never been happier in my work said pauley now 
preparing a series of prime time specials for nbc she is the 
substitute evening news anchor when tom brokaw is away 
gartner predicted better times ahead for the nbc nightly 
news third in ratings for seven straight weeks he introduced the 
shows new executive producer steve friedman calling him a show 
doctor who will make the newscast sparkle 
friedman ran today when it rose to first in ratings he left 
nbc in 1987 to create what proved a costly syndicated flop usa 
today on tv 
the normally brash producer made no promises of a fast ratings 
rise but said there would be changes to make the newscast a 
contender he declined to announce the changes citing competitive 
reasons 
network newscasts can no longer just index the days events 
he said we cant come on and say these are the top stories 
people have heard them already 
we are going to do a show of interest not the show of 
record he said 
the 24hour news service announced by gartner will provide 
affiliates with international national regional and breaking news 
for use in their own newscasts said robert horner in charge of the 
service 
although at first glance similar to cable news network the nbc 
service wont have anchors and wont transmit stories on a nonstop 
basis as cnn does 
it is intended to help nbc stations compete with cnns newscasts 
and to ward off further encroachments by cnn on nbc stations 
cnn says it has 216 broadcast affiliates of which 52 also are 
nbc affiliates 
nbcs convention will end wednesday

the us military is offering to 
evacuate the families of american servicemen at government expense 
following the recent slayings of americans and rebel threats of more 
attacks 
a military spokesman said today that us service personnel have 
until thursday to tell officials whether they want their families 
sent home 
we have asked those who have families to tell us when they 
would like to ship their dependents back before their tour ends 
said lt col ronald rand spokesman for clark air base 50 miles 
north of manila 
rand did not say what would happen if service members decided 
later to return their dependents 
adm huntington hardisty commander of us forces in the 
pacific authorized a program which allows a serviceman at any of 
the six us bases in the philippines to send members of his family 
home at government expense before his tour of duty ends rand said 
rand said a us governmentsponsored transfer of dependents of 
us servicemen is usually done when only on exceptional cases such 
as illness but he said a large number of requests and letters of 
concern about their families forced them to adopt the program 
a total of 40000 americans servicemen civilian workers and 
dependents are stationed at clark subic and four other american 
bases in the philippines at clark alone there are over 10000 
dependents rand said 
last month communist rebels killed two american airmen near 
clark and vowed more attacks until all us troops leave the 
country rebels also are suspected in the may 4 shooting death of a 
marine sergeant near subic 
at least eight americans have been slain in political attacks 
since april 1989 six of the victims were servicemen or associated 
with the military 
another american serviceman was killed saturday night but 
american and filipino officials said robbery not politics was 
the motive this time 
since friday us defense department civilians and military 
dependents who live on clark have been barred from leaving the base 
because of communist threats those living offbase have been 
ordered to limit travel to essential business 
rand said the restrictions would last for at least two months 
depending on us assessment of the threat 
the new peoples army the military wing of the outlawed 
communist party of the philippines has waged a 21yearold 
insurgency to establish a marxist state

aids experts are noncommittal even skeptical 
about reports that a mans aids infection disappeared after his 
blood was heattreated but that hasnt stopped hundreds of patients 
and physicians from trying to learn more 
dr kenneth alonso and dr william logan performed the 
hyperthermia procedure on a 33yearold aids patient with 
kaposis sarcoma a skin cancer commonly occurring with aids the 
mans blood was heated for two hours in hopes of attacking the 
cancer alonso said 
soon after the patients raised red skin lesions flattened to 
scars and tests for the aids virus have remained negative since 
alonso said 
we changed the disease its obvious that we did alonso 
said what the long term prognosis is we have no idea 
alonso said monday he is getting some 700 calls a day from 
anxious patients and doctors following a cable news network report 
last week hospitals and aids services organizations also are 
reporting numerous inquiries 
alonso is quick to note that he is not claiming an aids cure 
this is just what we did in a single case 
the patient at least is claiming victory im convinced im 
cured of aids carlton crawford told the daily citizen news in 
dalton his former hometown 
aids specialists are reluctant to speculate about the reports 
officials of the centers for disease control and the national 
infectious disease institute declined to comment 
a lot of us are real cautious about this said alice trinkl 
spokeswoman for aids research at the university of california at san 
francisco there have been so many promises made in the aids 
area 
it is important that a scientifically balanced evaluation be 
given to the situation said a statement from project inform a 
patient advocacy group and information clearinghouse in san 
francisco over the years far too many patients and their doctors 
have loudly announced miracle cures raising the hopes of other 
patients 
alonso stressed that he submitted his findings to the journal 
molecular oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy for normal peer 
review but the patient disclosed his treatment prompting alonso 
to discuss his work publicly 
he said he intends to perform the procedure on several more 
patients and see if we have made a difference 
some researchers have told me the results replicate what they 
have found in the lab he added thats very exciting to hear 
hyperthermia commonly used to treat infections before the advent 
of antibiotics is still used against some cancers 
alonso and logan determined that the patients sarcoma might 
respond to heat treatment then performed the hyperthermia process 
at atlanta hospital in february the patients blood was run in a 
loop out of his body through a 115degree heater and back in for 
two hours 
atlanta hospital covered the costs 35000 in the average case 
crawford said 
the patients body temperature rose to 107108 degrees throughout 
the procedure alonso said such a high fever could cause severe 
complications under routine circumstances but the patients ph 
oxygen mineral and fluid levels were carefully monitored and 
maintained thats why you can go through this alonso said 
we treated this gentleman with kaposis sarcoma with heat 
alonso said he went into complete remission blood tests and 
viral cultures have remained negative for human immunodeficiency 
virus since he said 
but project inform said the patient might have been 
overmedicated with azt prior to the procedure and simply 
stopping the drug could have produced some improvement 
the group also called viral cultures notoriously unreliable 
in determining whether a patient is infected from one day to the 
next 
hyperthermia deserves serious discussion by researchers 
project inform said but far more needs to be known about the 
obvious potential for toxicity inherent in raising a patients core 
temperature as high as that

percent closing at 3292162 the index was up 8421 points at the 
end of the morning session but fell back in the afternoon 
the decline came as market players stepped off to the sidelines 
ahead of thursdays final trading for june issues on the futures 
market said yoshiro inoue an analyst with nomura securities co 
participants were reluctant to buy as they were afraid of a 
rush of arbitrage selling to take profits from price gaps between 
the spot and futures markets for june issues before thursday he 
said

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
and cambodian premier hun sen signed a communique today that called 
for an end to hostilities but stopped short of announcing a 
ceasefire in cambodias 11yearold civil war 
the powerful communist khmer rouge guerrillas who are part of a 
threefaction rebel coalition sihanouk heads boycotted the session 
the statement said the factions should refrain from all 
offensive actions and there should be measures to ensure a 
military standstill but it said an actual ceasefire should 
be realized through agreement on forming a socalled supreme 
national council 
the council has been proposed as a body joining representatives 
of the resistance coalition and the hanoibacked phnom penh 
government it would administer the country in the period before a 
national vote to determine cambodias future 
the communique said a supreme national council should include 
equal numbers from the resistance coalition and from the phnom penh 
government and be formed by the end of july it mentioned a future 
role for the united nations in monitoring the withdrawal of foreign 
forces the end of foreign military supplies and a ceasefire 
agreement 
the impact of the declaration on fighting in cambodia was hard to 
judge combat intensified in the days preceding the tokyo conference 
as the contenders sought to extend their areas of control 
in bangkok sihanouk spokesman roland eng said heavy fighting was 
continuing and guerrilla groups had launched offensives in areas 
around phnom penh cambodias capital 
the khmer rouge nominal leader khieu samphan did not attend the 
signing ceremony he also boycotted the opening session monday when 
the tokyo peace conference started 
a statement from the khmer rouge was expected later the group 
had said it declined to join the conference unless it was an equal 
member rather than a part of sihanouks resistance coalition 
after the khmer rouge boycotted the conference informal meetings 
continued mostly in the hotel where the guerrilla delegations were 
staying pressure came from other countries including china which 
backs the khmer rouge the united states which backs sihanouk while 
trying to distance itself from the khmer rouge and thailand 
through which arms flow to the rebels 
thailands deputy prime minister gen chavalit yongchaiyudh who 
helped arrange the talks held separate meetings with hun sen and 
with sihanouks guerrilla factions 
chinese ambassador yang zhenya was seen leaving a corridor where 
informal talks were held us deputy assistant secretary of state 
david lambertson called on son sann the us embassy said 
lambertson was in tokyo for consultations and to observe the 
cambodian talks 
the less than full success of the meeting seemed certain to 
disappoint japan which was acting as host to its first 
international peace conference since world war ii 
the meeting was heralded as a steppingstone to a conference set 
for paris in july before the khmer rouge boycotted the conference 
was expected to be one of the rare instances in which all four 
contending factions would be present 
sihanouk 67 had said he intended to sign an agreement with hun 
sen whether the khmer rouge came along or not but he had to stay a 
rocky course to reach that point 
as he left for the signing ceremony with son sann the 
conservative leader of a guerrilla faction in his coalition 
sihanouk said they had worked hard to move toward peace and 
reconciliation and i am happy to be able to sign 
son sann said he had agreed to the arrangement 
the guerrilla coalition is fighting moderate communist hun sens 
government which was installed by vietnam in 1979 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and ended the brutal 
197579 rule of the khmer rouge when hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians were killed 
hun sen has refused to negotiate equally with the khmer rouge or 
allow them an equal role in a future interim government 
vietnam says it withdrew all its troops last september but there 
are charges that some remain

the inventor of a suicide device says he 
hooked an alzheimers disease victim to the druginjecting apparatus 
and watched her die 
dr jack kevorkian said janet adkins of portland ore used the 
device inside his van in a park about 40 miles north of detroit on 
monday afternoon she pressed a button to trigger the machine which 
injected her with a lethal dose of chemicals 
the last thing janet adkins said was you just make my case 
known said kevorkian a retired pathologist 
we have planned birth why not planned death he asked 
oakland county prosecutor richard thompson said he was aware 
adkins had died in his county he has said in the past that he 
believes that assisting suicide is a crime under michigan law 
others have interpreted the law differently 
there is an ongoing investigation and i dont want to discuss 
it any further thompson said 
state police in pontiac confirmed the womans death and said they 
are investigating kevorkian said he notified police after adkins 
death 
kevorkian said the 54yearold woman her husband and a friend 
flew to michigan because supplying the means to commit suicide is a 
felony in oregon 
she is a remarkable woman kevorkian said she was a 
housewife who traveled extensively she taught english parttime 
she played the piano but the disease took away her ability to read 
music she couldnt even spell any more 
alzheimers disease is an irreversible degeneration of the brain 
cells that can lead to severe memory loss and dementia 
she told me she wanted to take her life while she was still 
clear in her mind and knew what she was doing kervorkian said 
she contacted kevorkian in october he said kevorkian said he 
persuaded her to try an experimental drug treatment in seattle in an 
attempt to put the disease into remission 
at first i was not going to let her use the device 
kevorkian said but the seattle treatment didnt work she told me 
she had pills and she was going to do it commit suicide anyway 
neither the husband nor the family friend wanted to be near when 
the woman committed suicide so they flew back to oregon earlier 
monday he said 
the device involves hooking a person to an intravenous saline 
solution the person can press a button that stops the saline 
solution and injects the drug thiopental which causes 
unconsciousness 
within a minute potassium chloride is injected automatically at 
a dosage high enough to stop the heart and cause death within 
minutes 
jim baughman chief of the wayne county prosecutors appellate 
division said last fall that helping someone die with the device 
wouldnt be a crime under michigan law because the patient not the 
doctor would inject the drugs 
baughman said his opinion was based on a 1982 michigan court of 
appeals decision in which it overruled a lower court conviction of a 
man who gave a gun to a friend knowing the friend was going to 
commit suicide 
if you actually take part in the act thats criminal 
baughman said if you provide the means to do it thats not

dismayed nazi hunters today denounced defeat in the 
house of lords of a government bill that would have allowed 
prosecutions of suspected war criminals they said some of 
hitlers worst henchmen live in britain 
the 20774 vote by the unelected upper chamber to throw out a 
measure that had been overwhelmingly adopted by the elected house of 
commons also set off a constitutional conflict 
the vote just after midnight following nine hours of emotional 
debate left britain the only one of the world war ii allies without 
laws to prosecute suspected war criminals 
canada and australia have changed their laws to allow trials and 
the united states has deported suspects for trial 
the simon wiesenthal center which submitted a list of suspects 
to prime minister margaret thatchers government in 1986 said it 
was deeply upset 
i think it is unthinkable that this country which suffered so 
much at the hands of the nazis continues to give a haven to some of 
hitlers worst henchmen said ephraim zuroff head of the israeli 
section of the los angelesbased wiesenthal center 
zuroff in london for the debate said he will submit more names 
of britishresident suspects to the government this week 
the lords action was a rare break with the popularly elected 
house of commons 
the lords powers are limited to delaying bills for a year and 
the government now must decide whether to reintroduce the bill in 
the autumn and force it through the lords under a rarely used 
parliamentary rule 
traditionally the lords only revise clauses and never rejects 
outright legislation passed by the house of commons the commons 
passed the bill by a 27060 majority in december 
the vote followed an inquiry by a governmentappointed commission 
that said there was enough evidence to prosecute three suspects for 
murder and investigate another 124 the suspects allegedly helped 
round up and murder thousands of jews in nazioccupied soviet 
republics 
i am not only dismayed i am disgusted said lord cocks a 
member of the opposition labor party with all the problems facing 
this country the house of lords has gratuitously stirred up this 
constitutional issue of the lords vs the commons it is wrong and 
unnecessary 
the lords a mostly elderly body of hereditary peers judges 
bishops and politicians given lifetime titles argued that it was 
wrong to make retroactive laws that fair trials would be impossible 
because of the age of witnesses and that the legislation would lead 
to show trials 
the archbishops of the church of england and methodist leader 
lord soper who sit in the upper chamber all voted against 
prosecutions soper said christian charity meant letting bygones 
be bygones 
some lords cautioned against stirring antisemitic prejudice by 
prosecuting old nazis but others said defeating the bill was the 
wrong message to send to europe at a time of renewed antisemitism 
concentration camp survivor lord kagan 75 rejected arguments 
that witnesses memories could be faulty 
anybody who was in a concentration camp he knew his guards 
face he knew every muscle it was etched into his mind into his 
memory and into his heart said kagan 
government ministers battled to save the bill from defeat 
murder is murder in any language in any country said earl 
ferrers a hereditary peer and home office minister in mrs 
thatchers government 
other countries who were faced with the evidence that now 
confronts us have changed their law he said it would be 
unfortunate if the united kingdom with all its international 
standing for justice and integrity should be tainted with the 
slur of being a haven for criminals 
the bill was designed to become law by july partly because of 
the age of three prime suspects and the age of witnesses 
opponents of the bill included peers whose world war ii units 
were the first british troops to enter the belsen concentration camp 
as the nazis were pushed back in 1945 
legislators in the commons most of whom were children or not 
born during the war have accepted overwhelmingly a 
governmentappointed commissions recommendation to prosecute 
suspected war criminals 
britains chief rabbi lord jakobovits a refugee from nazi 
germany who was nominated for the lords by mrs thatcher in 1981 
said a no vote would give the wrong signal amid renewed signs of 
antisemitism in europe 
some opponents of this bill are among the staunchest 
friends of the jewish people declared jakobovits 69 but i 
have got to add that so were some of those who were appeasers of the 
nazis in the 1930s

former president ford says he believes 
president bush is being firm enough with mikhail gorbachev about 
lithuania for now but he predicts the issue will continue to 
complicate ussoviet relations 
in an appearance monday at the national press club ford also 
said he believed bush and the soviet president established a warm 
and useful relationship during their summit in washington which 
ended sunday 
before the summit bush said he would ask congress to approve a 
liberalized trade agreement with the soviets only if moscow dropped 
restrictions on emigration and ended its partial economic blockade 
of lithuania 
after meeting with gorbachev however he announced such an 
agreement and said it was linked only to emigration he made no 
mention of the embargo on lithuania which gorbachev imposed in 
retaliation for the soviet republics declaration of independence 
the soviet legislature today postponed until at least september 
adoption of a new emigration law that the united states says must be 
passed before washington will give moscow preferential trade status 
ford was asked whether he would have dealt more firmly with 
gorbachev on the lithuanian question 
the former president said he had great admiration for the people 
of lithuania and the other baltic republics noting that about 
10000 latvians emigrated after world war ii to the michigan 
congressional district that he represented before becoming vice 
president and then president 
so i start out with a sympathy for their desire to regain their 
independence ford said at the same time we have to have a 
reasonable and balanced approach in the overall global context of 
what this issue might be so for the time at least i am going to 
take the point of view that president bush is handling it properly 
he said members of congress very likely would try to block 
the trade agreement but he did not know whether they would succeed 
the problem of the baltic nations is going to be a very 
difficult one for mr gorbachev to solve and it will be a 
continuing problem between the government of the united states and 
the soviet union ford said

a christian scientist on trial for his sons death 
testified that he now wishes he had sought medical help for the 
ailing 2yearold 
david and ginger twitchell are accused of recklessly causing the 
boys death because they treated him with prayer instead of 
conventional medicine robyn died from a bowel obstruction in april 
1986 
if medical science could have saved my son i wish i had turned 
to it twitchell said monday during his trial for manslaughter 
twitchell said that after hearing the previous weeks testimony 
he now wishes he had sought medical care for robyn 
the couple has said they rely on spiritual healing to cure 
physical ailments according to christian science principles 
defense attorneys have sought to show that robyns symptoms 
resembled the flu an autopsy showed the boy had a birth defect that 
caused the obstruction 
prosecutor john kiernan asked twitchell about his assertion 
during a network television broadcast two years ago that he still 
did not wish he had called for medical treatment for his sons 
condition 
twitchell said his conversations with medical professionals at 
that time did not convince him that medicine could have saved his 
son 
but now he indicated he is of a different mind 
my present state of mind is that if they had diagnosed it 
properly if we had gone to them early enough if there were not 
complications they could have saved him he testified 
today if prayer did not seem to be working in a similar 
circumstance i would give medical science a chance to try their 
hand he said 
kiernan repeatedly questioned twitchell about dental work he had 
done he indicated that twitchell relied on medication by accepting 
a painkiller during the procedure but denied similar relief to 
his little child 
i did not refuse to provide it to him but i did not provide it 
to him twitchell responded 
he acknowledged that his reliance on a dentist was a failure of 
spiritual healing and that robyns death was a failure of 
spiritual healing 
officials from the christian science church which is based in 
boston contend the state of massachusetts has put the religion 
itself on trial 
prosecutors have denied that they are attacking the christian 
science religion but say they are trying to protect children from 
parents who put their children at risk by relying solely on 
spiritual healing

the first meeting between a south 
korean and soviet leader accelerated efforts toward full diplomatic 
ties and was greeted in south korea today as a turning point in the 
nations foreign relations 
president roh taewoo said that as a result of mondays meeting 
with mikhail s gorbachev in san francisco normal bilateral 
relations between our countries will be restored after 45 years 
no dates were announced for establishing diplomatic relations 
but a roh aide said it could be expected in the notdistant 
future 
the south korean newspaper donga ilbo said roh agreed to send 
foreign minister choi hojoong to moscow by july it quoted 
highranking officials as saying full diplomatic ties could be 
established by september 
we are convinced that the summit meeting has not only been a 
turning point in relations between the two countries but has also 
been an epochmaking event which will see an end to the cold war 
legacy on the korean peninsula and will pave the way for a peaceful 
reunification between south and north korea said lee soojung a 
government spokesman traveling with roh 
lees statement was released in seoul today 
rohs announcement was welcomed by most south koreans who want 
to see an easing of hostilities with communist north korea the 
koreas were divided in 1945 fought a bloody civil war in the early 
1950s and remain bitter enemies 
north korea is a longtime ally of the soviet union 
but not all south koreans welcomed the improvement in 
seoulmoscow ties 
scattered violent protests erupted at several campuses where 
radical students denounced rohs diplomatic overtures to communist 
nations 
in southern kwangju about 2000 militant students yelling 
antigovernment slogans fought riot police with firebombs and rocks 
said yonhap the national news agency 
in seoul several hundred students throwing firebombs and rocks 
clashed with police firing tear gas outside korea university and 
hankuk university of foreign studies 
wall posters at two schools denounced the talks and warned moscow 
your diplomats arriving in seoul will be driven out by the korean 
people 
radical students say roh wants to establish relations with moscow 
to delay unification of the peninsula they say moscows recognition 
of the seoul government will perpetuate the division 
in a statement issued today a major alliance of dissident groups 
said rohs diplomacy was subservient to the superpowers 
afternoon newspapers devoted their entire front sections to the 
talks both kbs and its rival munwha broadcasting co devoted five 
hours of live satellite and local coverage to rohs visit in san 
francisco 
roh has been pursuing a policy of establishing ties with current 
and former communist countries to isolate north korea south korea 
now has relations with all countries in east europe except albania 
and east germany the government says it is working toward ties with 
china and east germany 
south korea also hopes diplomatic ties with the soviet union and 
china the two largest communist nations will enhance its 
international prestige and gain acceptance for seoul as an asian and 
world power 
south korea the 10thlargest trading country in the world also 
hopes to expand economic and trade relations with moscow 
but some south koreans expressed disappointment that the talks 
apparently did not result in concrete agreements on pursuing peace 
on the divided korean peninsula or a timetable for normalizing 
relations with moscow 
the party for peace and democracy the main opposition party 
welcomed the prospect of normalizing sovietsouth korean relations 
but criticized roh for taking a low profile during the talks 
the fact that the two met face to face is very important to 
us said dr rhee sangwoo a government adviser and dean at 
seouls sogang university regardless of the subjects discussed 
the fact they met is most important 
north korea has criticized the rohgorbachev meeting 
the border between the communist north and capitalist south is 
the most heavily fortified in the world more than 1 million armed 
soldiers are on either side behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire 
dissidents have called for independent talks between the koreas 
saying both the soviet union and the united states were responsible 
for the division of the peninsula at the end of world war ii

albania was granted observer status at the fourweek human rights 
talks the hardline communist country has begun to seek greater 
contacts following years of isolation 
lithuania which also had sought permission to attend the 
meeting was politely turned down said a statement from the 
lithuanian world community 
max kampelman head of the us delegation said the group would 
consider establishing a body to mediate disputes involving ethnic 
minorities 
as the eastwest conflict reduces in importance and 
confrontations we are seeing some of the old preworld war ii 
tensions developing again kampelman said in an interview 
one of the subjects we will discuss is whether the csce process 
can provide some mediation role here he said 
kampelman a veteran diplomat and arms negotiator said one such 
conflict could be the alleged discrimination by ethnic hungarians 
living in romania they say they are unable to develop their own 
culture 
frankly there is no other mechanism to deal with minority 
questions he said were going to see if we can evolve one 
the 15yearold international organization has no enforcement 
power and its mediation in any dispute could by applied only 
voluntarily he said 
kampelman said he expected the copenhagen meeting to endorse the 
principles of free elections and rule of law meaning that those 
who govern also are subject to the law and not arbitrariness 
the conference on security and cooperation is comprised of the 
united states canada and all european countries except albania 
which now wants to join it was established by the helsinki accords 
which eased security tensions and set standards for cooperation and 
human rights 
the copenhagen conference was the second of three planned on 
human rights the first in paris last june failed to approve a 
final document because of romanian opposition the third is 
scheduled for moscow next year

president bush is likely to block new offshore 
oil activity along the california and florida coasts while calling 
for environmental impact studies administration officials say 
the longpending decision would ease republican electionyear 
concerns in the environmentally conscious states if bushs decision 
follows the officials expectations 
however white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today 
that bush has not decided this issue yet and he ruled out the 
possibility of an announcement this week 
the option bush is said to be leaning to would bar new drilling 
off florida until the year 2002 off northern california until 1997 
and off southern california until at least 1992 according to 
officials who spoke monday on condition of anonymity 
the dates reflect the years when the governments fiveyear 
leasing plans are up for review the current one expires in 1992 
the officials cautioned that the president still could change his 
apparent course and open the way for some drilling but they said 
that appeared unlikely 
a task force bush appointed last year to study effects of 
potential drilling in the three areas concluded that there was not 
enough information to go ahead with the new offshore activity 
the florida congressional delegation has unanimously urged bush 
to bar offshore drilling as has republican gov bob martinez who 
is seeking reelection to a second term 
republican sen pete wilson seeking the governorship of 
california wants a total ban on new oil activity along the coast 
and opposed the reagan administrations efforts to expand leasing 
areas 
a postponement would fall short of the decision sought by 
environmentalists who contend there have been enough studies to 
show the environmental harm and warrant a permanent ban in both 
states 
the public has moved far beyond where delays are going to 
satisfy people its time to move to protect some of these areas 
permanently said lisa speer an attorney for the natural 
resources defense council 
the broadest set of options initially drawn by the presidents 
staff ranged from opening the study areas for leasing and drilling 
to permanently banning such activity 
bush has expressed the most interest in options involving 
postponement of new oil activity pending new studies and more 
specific options were developed accordingly the officials said 
the president named a task force last year headed by interior 
secretary manuel lujan to work with the national academy of 
sciences in studying the environmental impact of opening the three 
areas to oil leasing 
the regions under consideration are a 67million acre section 
of ocean off southern california 12 million acres off northern 
california and 13 million acres in the gulf of mexico near the 
florida everglades 
a policy initiated by former president reagans interior 
secretary james watt opened the entire 14billionacre outer 
continental shelf but leasing has been blocked over the years by 
congressionally imposed moratoriums 
in florida the government sold 73 leases in the affected area in 
the early 1980s for 108 million the cost of buying the leases back 
could be closer to 200 million interior department officials say 
southern california is the only region of the country other than 
the gulf of mexico where offshore oil development is under way 22 
oil platforms are operating 
the interior departments current fiveyear program had 
anticipated new lease sales last september but they were put off 
pending bushs decision 
the northern california leases about 90 miles north of san 
francisco and off eureka had been scheduled for sale early last 
year but the sale was postponed

the soviet legislature today tentatively postponed 
until september adoption of a new emigration law that washington 
says is necessary before it will give moscow preferential trade 
status 
president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush signed a trade 
agreement at the washington summit but bush said he wont press the 
us congress to grant the soviet union mostfavorednation trading 
status until the emigration legislation is passed 
soviet restrictions on emigration have for decades been a major 
impediment to improved ussoviet relations millions of dollars of 
trade and the fate of soviets hoping to emigrate are riding on 
approval of the law 
the soviet legislature by acclamation adopted a new agenda that 
dropped consideration of the emigration law before the body adjourns 
june 14 for the summer 
fyodor burlatsky a member of the legislatures international 
affairs committee had said in a television interview recently the 
law would be considered may 31 
the decision drew immediate criticism from lawmakers who said it 
opened the soviet union to accusations of duplicity 
we will turn out to be cheats we wont be trusted they will 
say well they made a promise and again the soviet union is 
deceiving nikolai medvedev a supreme soviet member from 
lithuania told the session 
in response supreme soviet chairman anatoly lukyanov held out 
the possibility that the decision would be reviewed and the law 
taken up earlier 
the president will arrive we will look it over and if there is 
a possibility we will include this issue we will look it over with 
the president lukyanov said 
it was not clear whether the postponement was made with 
gorbachevs approval whether it was a mistake or whether other 
kremlin leaders engineered the decision it could be an 
embarrassment to gorbachev who was returning from the summit today 
lukyanov is a close ally of gorbachev carrying out the leaders 
will in the legislature and he did not explain why he allowed what 
appeared to be such a radical shift so soon after the soviet 
commitment in washington to enact the legislation 
medvedev said soviet officials had promised us senators during 
the justcompleted summit that the new emigration bill would be 
approved during the current supreme soviet session 
the proposed legislation which was given preliminary approval in 
november would allow emigration of virtually anyone who has entry 
permission from another country and no outstanding alimony 
obligations criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets

congressional leaders told president bush today 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev must lighten up on 
lithuania if he expects congress to go along with trade benefits to 
moscow 
call it linkage or call it reality senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan said after bush briefed top house and senate 
leaders on his private conversations with gorbachev during the 
summit 
lawmakers said bush told them he had received no assurances from 
gorbachev even in private that the soviet union would lift its 
economic boycott of the rebellious baltic state 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said bush made it very 
clear that he had presented a strong case to gorbachev for easing 
up in lithuania 
when the president sends us the trade agreement there will 
be many in congress who will want to see some progress on lithuania 
before approving it foley said i asked the president if he 
thought president gorbachev understood there might be such reaction 
from congress he said he did 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that despite the 
lack of a commitment from gorbachev on lithuania the president is 
persuaded that he gorbachev wants to resolve the issue 
at the same time the president is mindful of congressional 
sentiment against granting the benefits to moscow in absence of 
progress on lithuania 
the only linkage is on the emigration reform law but we will 
never dismiss our concerns about lithuania fitzwater said 
meanwhile fitzwater said that bush continued the process of 
conferring with allied leaders that he began on sunday calling 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu monday night and french 
president francois mitterrand this morning 
the spokesman said gorbachevs aircraft as it cleared us air 
space at 139 am edt today beamed a message to the white house 
hailing the fruits of the summit and relaying the soviet leaders 
sincere gratitude 
im not going to assess whether his pressing gorbachev was 
adequate or not said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine he said he made the case 
but the senate leader said nothing the president said made him 
feel any more optimistic that a lithuanian settlement was near 
dole said bush told lawmakers at the 45minute session that he 
felt comfortable with gorbachev that they could speak with complete 
candor and without rancor 
after a strong lobbying campaign from gorbachev bush signed a 
trade agreement with the soviet leader last friday without a return 
commitment on lithuania 
however bush said he would not send the agreement which would 
open the way for granting moscow mostfavorednation trade status 
to congress until the soviet legislature passes a liberalized 
emigration law 
the soviet legislature today postponed until at least september 
adoption of such a law 
sen alan cranston dcalif who flew to california with 
gorbachev on sunday said he had a chance to have a relaxed 
intimate conversation with the soviet leader on lithuania and 
other subjects 
he said he told gorbachev that use of violence to block 
lithuanian independence would wreck moscows chances of getting 
mostfavorednation trade status it could also torpedo hopes of 
getting a longrange nuclear weapons treaty this year cranston said 
he told gorbachev 
he indicated very clearly that violence in lithuania is not 
going to occur cranston said i thought that was reassuring 
in addition to congressional skepticism over the soviet trade 
pact the administration also faces broad opposition for bushs 
recent decision renewing trade benefits to china 
china flared as an issue before lawmakers left the capital on may 
24 for the memorial day holiday bush announced then that he would 
extend for one year the mostfavorednation trade status that grants 
china lower tariffs on goods exported to the united states 
mitchell who opposes the trade benefits because of chinas human 
rights practices said he would meet with other lawmakers this week 
to map out a course to try to reverse bushs decision 
in the legislative arena meanwhile the senate is taking up a 
wideranging crimefighting bill more than 250 amendments were 
stacked up when congress recessed and the democratic leadership 
will seek a vote to curtail debate 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
urged his colleagues to curb the debate saying this legislation 
should not be killed by delay 
amid this jockeying former white house press secretary james 
brady felled by john hinckley jrs march 1981 assault on president 
reagan and now a guncontrol lobbyist announced a brady bill 
blitz 
bradys campaign seeks support for a provision requiring a 
sevenday coolingoff period for the purchase of handguns the 
provision is designed to give police more time to conduct a record 
check of wouldbe handgun buyers 
house members were expected by wednesday to try to override 
bushs veto of a bill authorizing 2 billion for amtrak the 
president objected to one provision in that measure that would 
expand federal oversight of railroad acquisitions in a way he said 
would be a step backward for the entire rail industry

a federal judge has ruled that top elected 
officials in the nations most populous county systematically 
discriminated against hispanic voters to protect their own positions 
in office 
the plaintiffs called mondays ruling a landmark civil rights 
decision that will end more than a century of white domination of 
politics in the county of 87 million people an estimated 35 
percent are hispanic but no member of any minority group has been 
elected to the board of supervisors since 1875 
the ruling by us district judge david kenyon charged that los 
angeles countys fivemember board conspired to protect their 
incumbencies and that of their allies when they redrew the 
countys five voting districts in 1981 
the judge said the redistricting violated the 1965 federal voting 
rights act and the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to 
the constitution 
the decision immediately throws the results of todays balloting 
in two supervisorial districts into question plaintiffs urged that 
the results be thrown out and kenyon said he would hold a hearing 
thursday to determine how the election results should be handled 
for 115 years the los angeles county board of supervisors has 
been an exclusive male allwhite club said marc rosenbaum an 
attorney for the american civil liberties union foundation of 
southern california which was one of the plaintiffs today that 
club membership is open to everyone 
attorney general dick thornburgh called the ruling a victory 
against discrimination the justice department had joined in the 
suit 
representatives of the mexican american legal defense and 
educational fund another plaintiff said they would demand that 
county officials immediately redraw boundaries and create a largely 
hispanic district 
we want a remedy now we want a remedy that encompasses a fair 
opportunity for our community to represent itself and to elect 
representatives who will represent its interests said antonia 
hernandez president and general counsel for the legal fund 
disputing the countys claims that creating a hispanicmajority 
district was impossible kenyon found that the hispanic community 
was large and geographically compact such that a fivedistrict 
plan can be drawn in which hispanics comprise a majority of the 
citizen votingage population in one of the five districts 
kenyon also recommended expansion of the board saying the 
districts are too large for one person to represent constituents 
adequately 
supervisor kenneth hahn said he will introduce a motion at 
tuesdays meeting to expand the board to seven members such 
proposals have been introduced before and would be subject to voter 
approval 
pete schabarum a supervisor who decided not to seek reelection 
said the timing of kenyons ruling confused elections 
i continue to believe that district lines should not be based 
on ethnic factors he added 
supervisor michael antonovich predicted the county would appeal 
county counsel dewitt clinton would not comment on that possibility 
the lawsuit filed in august 1988 charged that the supervisors 
deliberately spread the countys hispanic population across several 
districts when they redrew voting boundaries following the 1980 
federal census 
the explosive and continuous growth of the los angeles county 
hispanic community was evident at the time of the adoption of the 
1981 redistricting plan as was the steady decline of the countys 
nonhispanic white population kenyon wrote 
the judge also concluded that hispanics and nonhispanics are 
widely polarized when it comes to voting trends hispanics vote in 
large numbers for fellow hispanics he said and nonhispanics 
rarely vote for hispanics 
attorneys for both sides have said they believe the judge will 
allow the supervisors to redraw district boundaries which he could 
accept or reject

new jerseys supreme court today declared 
the states 15yearold system of financing public schools 
unconstitutional because it hurts poorer urban school districts 
in the unanimous ruling the court said the system left such 
districts without the money and resources they need to give their 
children the education that the state constitution requires 
the dilemma is that while we spend so much there is absolutely 
no question that we are failing to provide students in the poorer 
urban districts with the kind of education that anyone can call 
thorough and efficient said the ruling which was written by 
chief justice robert n wilentz 
the justices ordered lawmakers to begin fixing the problem by the 
199192 school year they said the state must assure that 
disadvantaged districts spend about the same amount of money on each 
child that is spent in richer suburban districts 
the court estimated it would have added about 440 million to the 
35 billion the state spent this year on public school aid to boost 
funding in poor districts to the required levels 
it said more money is particularly needed to meet the special 
education needs and address the extreme disadvantages of 
schoolchildren in poor communities 
the court said it is not ordering equalized financing statewide 
richer districts may choose to spend more on education but the 
state would be required to increase its aid to poorer districts if 
the education in those school systems continues to be lacking 
lawmakers may devise any remedy they wish to correct the 
disparities between wealthy and poor districts but they may not do 
it by forcing poor districts to raise property taxes the court 
ruled 
capping a decadelong legal battle the justices repeatedly said 
education financing cannot depend on the decisions of local schools 
boards and districts must be guaranteed a certain amount of money 
every year 
they also rejected the states argument that money will not solve 
the problem because many urban districts will simply mismanage and 
waste the additional money 
money can make a difference if effectively used it can provide 
the students with an equal educational opportunity a chance to 
succeed they are entitled to that chance constitutionally 
entitled wilentz wrote 
new jersey is among more than a dozen states where courts have 
overturned school finance systems in recent years the others are 
texas kentucky kansas wisconsin california connecticut 
washington west virginia wyoming arkansas and montana 
the latest conflict pitted the state against the newarkbased 
education law center the center which brought the lawsuit in 1981 
charged that new jerseys 35 billion system discriminates against 
poor districts because of its heavy reliance on property taxes 
it contended that poor and urban districts are unable to raise 
the money needed to provide a quality education and that the system 
has allowed the gap between rich and poor districts to widen 
the lawsuit was brought on behalf of 20 schoolage children from 
four new jersey cities 
after a similar legal battle fought throughout the 1970s the 
court ordered the legislature to overhaul new jerseys school 
financing system and lawmakers enacted a state income tax to pay 
for more state education aid in todays decision the court found 
that those reforms did not fully solve the problem 
its a victory for the schoolchildren of new jersey and the 
courts proposed remedy strives to do essentially but in a more 
modest way what the governor has proposed himself said emma 
byrne gov jim florios spokeswoman 
this latest ruling comes barely a week after florio unveiled a 
sweeping plan to overhaul the financing system 
the governor wants to spend more state money on poor and 
middleincome districts and reduce or eliminate aid to wealthier 
school systems he also wants to increase the income tax to provide 
1 billion more in state education aid 
his plan establishes a minimum amount of money that districts 
should spend on each child and determines how much the community 
should be required to raise on its own based on property wealth and 
the wealth of a communitys residents the state would then provide 
aid to make up the difference 
in 1988 administrative law judge steven lefelt ruled that the 
financing system as reformed in the 1970s had failed because 
poorer districts still fell behind wealthier districts 
i do not believe in fixing what is not broken however 
plaintiffs have proven the system is broken he said in his ruling 
he said more money may not be the only solution but that it is a 
start 
administrative law decisions are subject to review by state 
officials education commissioner saul cooperman rejected lefelts 
findings agreeing with the stand that then gov thomas h keans 
administration took for the eight years it fought the lawsuit

attacks on each other during the campaign instead saying their 
priority is unseating the republican helms 
helms already has the gop nomination and has been running 
commercials attacking both democrats 
gantt led a sixcandidate field in the may 8 primary but failed 
to reach the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff between the top two 
votegetters 
easley who received 30 percent to gantts 37 percent demanded 
the runoff despite gantts pleas to avoid one for the sake of 
democratic unity 
after voting today in charlotte gantt said wed like to carry 
the west and wed like to carry the east just to prove a point 
and he said he was eager to campaign against helms im ready 
to get into this fight he said im ready to get it on with 
him 
easley in greenville accused helms of running far more ads 
against him than against gantt because the senator would rather 
beat me in the last five days of the primary than face me for five 
months in the election 
beth burrus a spokeswoman for the helms campaign said that 
there is no attempt to single out easley and that helms doesnt care 
who wins the runoff 
the polls show that its going to be a very close race whoever 
wins she said both candidates lead helms at this time

the soviet union said today it plans 
to withdraw 1500 nuclear warheads and other tactical shortrange 
nuclear weapons from central europe by the end of the year 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who made the 
announcment said later that a very small amount relatively of 
soviet battlefield nuclear weapons will remain in europe after the 
withdrawals 
this is going to be a very substantive amount said 
shevardnadze who is in copenhagen for a 35nation human rights 
conference 
us secretary of state james a baker iii also at the 
conference was cautious in his assssment of the announcement 
we are still in the process of taking a look at it analyzing 
it baker said he said the extent of the withdrawal was not 
clear nor whether the soviets would destroy or simply remove the 
weapons 
also baker said it was not clear whether the arms shevardnadze 
spoke about would have been withdrawn in any event with the soviet 
troops currently being pulled out of eastern europe 
shevardnadze and baker are meeting during the human rights 
conference to push ahead with issues discussed during the washington 
summit between soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and president bush 
a central issue was the military future of a united germany 
europe and the united states want germany as part of nato but the 
soviet union has balked at that idea 
speaking to the conference shevardnadze said a compromise could 
be found in soviet differences with washington over germany he said 
the sovietled warsaw pact would begin a transformation at its 
next meeting and that nato should do the same 
this is the way as we underlined in the past that we can find 
a compromise on the german issue shevardnadze said 
baker planned to assure shevardnadze at a meeting tonight that 
the north atlantic treaty organization would undertake a review of 
its mission in light of easing eastwest tensions 
bush and the heads of 15 other allied governments will meet in 
london next month the occasion is expected to mark a lowering of 
natos military profile and a shift to more of a political profile 
in his speech shevardnadze said the soviet withdrawal of nuclear 
weapons from central europe would ease tensions and give more 
latitude to man 
in addition to the nuclear warheads he said his government will 
withdraw 60 tactical missile launchers more than 250 units of 
atomic artillery and 3200 atomic guns 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher welcomed the 
announcement but said the soviets enjoyed a superiority in 
shortrange missiles 
the unilateral steps from the soviet union are going to make 
negotiations on weapons easier so we welcome it as a positive 
step genscher said 
in his efforts to gain mosocws suppport for nato membership for 
a united germany baker carried with him to copenhagen promises of 
western economic help and nuclear and territorial assurances 
the possibility that west germany would build houses for 
returning soviet troops was even included in a ninepoint program 
baker told reporters on his flight from washington that building 
houses for troops withdrawn from eastern and central europe fits 
right in with the economic cooperation plan 
his problem is selling the package to shevardnadze the soviet 
people harbor deep mistrust of germany memories linger of world war 
ii in which the nazis were routed from russian soil after more than 
20 million soviets were killed 
the foreign ministers are in copenhagen for a european security 
conference meeting on human rights 
one of bakers nine points is to expand the conferences 
functions a longheld soviet goal the issue would be taken up by 
the 35 member nations instead of just nato and the warsaw pact 
other key points include 
assurances by the germans they would not try to expand their 
territory beyond the lands now controlled by west germany and east 
germany 
a pledge by the new germany not to acquire nuclear or chemical 
weapons 
west german economic assistance for the soviet union 
keeping soviet troops in what is now east germany for a 
transitional period 
keeping western forces out of the territory 
an acceleration of negotiations to ban shortrange nuclear 
weapons in nato and the warsaw pact 
a revision of nato military doctrine to reflect the easing of 
eastwest tensions 
a prompt second round of negotiations to make deeper cuts in 
troops tanks and other nonnuclear arms in europe once the treaty 
is concluded to reduce us and soviet manpower and weapons this 
would give moscow a chance to seek limitations on the german army

the 1990 census has counted 87 percent of 
american households an official said tuesday 
spokesman ray bancroft said the households had been counted in 
the mail and doortodoor portions of the census which is 
continuing 
bancroft said the 90 percent level could be reached within a 
week but that the last 10 percent is the hardest to count 
people who mailed back their census forms in march were the 
easiest to tally and census workers have added to that total by 
visiting the homes of those who didnt get forms in the mail or 
failed to send them back 
now they are trying to count people who are reluctant to 
cooperate with government officials are away from home or are so 
busy working that they are hard to find 
the census mandated every 10 years by the constitution is used 
to redistribute seats in the house of representatives and to divide 
billions of dollars in federal aid among state and communities 
nearly 100 million forms were mailed in april 
bancroft said census maps of local communities were being sent to 
about 39000 local governments 
by the end of august each community will receive a count of the 
number of housing units on each block and the total population of 
the community local officials will have 15 days to report any 
discrepancies between their counts and the census report 
meanwhile processing is running well ahead of the rate set 10 
years ago bancroft said 
the 1980 census forms were kept at local offices until the area 
count was complete then shipped en masse to processing centers 
that meant computer processing didnt begin until august 1980 
this year forms are shipped to the seven processing centers as 
they are collected microfilming and computer processing has already 
begun 
the first official census report is expected to be delivered to 
president bush on dec 31 listing the population of the country and 
of each state as well as how many house seats to which each state is 
entitled

a city university professor says he has solved 
the mystery of who was behind the 1912 piltdown man fraud which 
rocked the scientific community and provided fodder for a 
decadeslong whodunit 
dr frank spencer anthropology professor at queens college a 
branch of city university said in a telephone interview today that 
the names of many prominent scientists and even mystery maven sir 
arthur conan doyle had been mentioned as suspects through the 
years 
but his research bolstered by that of australian historian ian 
langham points the finger at sir arthur keith a wellrespected 
anatomist and conservator of the hunterian museum of the royal 
college of surgeons 
spencer lays out the premise for the fraud in two new books to be 
published this fall by oxford university press 
piltdown a small village in england made international news in 
1912 when a skull and jaw of what became known as the piltdown 
man were discovered in a gravel pit 
it was sensational because it offered a completely different 
view of evolution at the time spencer said 
but in 1953 the discovery was completely debunked when it was 
learned the remains were actually a human skull only a couple of 
hundred years old with an orangutans jaw fused to it 
still the larger question remained who did it 
fingers immediately pointed to charles dawson the country lawyer 
who made the discovery but the scientific community believed 
someone else had to be involved 
the names of scientist william j sollas philosopher pierre 
teilhard de chardin and even doyle the sherlock holmes inventor who 
lived nearby kept coming up but there was never any proof and 
often no motive 
the general feeling was that piltdown was contrived to bring 
somebody down make someone in the scientific community look 
silly spencer said but that theory didnt work because if that 
was the case why didnt anyone ever do that 
spencer said once he began looking at the evidence with the 
viewpoint that dawsons coconspirator was someone who had something 
to gain intellectually not monetarily he began to look at keith 
but his search for documents collided with the efforts of 
langham a professor at the university of sydney in australia and 
spencer said he backed off and allowed langham to continue his 
research alone 
when langham died in 1984 without concluding his research 
spencer said langhams widow asked him to continue her husbands 
work 
he said the turning point was entries in keiths diary in which 
he indicates he had information about the site and events at 
piltdown which he wouldnt have had unless he was an inside 
member of the group this was really the crux of the thing 
spencer said he and langham also uncovered the fact that keith a 
scientist who backed the theory of evolution that came out of 
piltdown had met with dawson a year before the discovery and again 
just several months before 
though spencer believes he and langham have cracked the piltdown 
mystery doubting thomases still abound 
dr fred h smith a paleontologist at the university of 
tennessee at knoxville told the new york times that spencer makes a 
good case but its not ironclad 
dr william ball a former keeper of paleontology at the british 
museum said until someone comes up with a signed confession 
questions surrounding piltdown will remain

the presbyterian church usa today 
approved a statement of faith that mixes traditional christian 
beliefs with environmental concerns and images of god as both mother 
and father 
commissioners stood and cheered after approving the statement 
the churchs first since a 1983 merger of its northern and southern 
branches following a 122year split over slavery in a 499to25 
vote 
i think the statement of faith is a reflection of the churchs 
ability even in the face of considerable diversity that we are 
still capable of forming a unified statement of christian belief 
that is consistent with our tradition said the rev john mulder 
president of louisville presbyterian seminary 
the statement must be sent to the denominations 177 
presbyteries if twothirds of them approve it will come before the 
1991 general assembly for a final vote it would then become the 
11th statement in the 29 millionmember denominations book of 
confessions 
the statement upholds centuriesold church teachings that jesus 
christ was both fully human and fully god and that god raised jesus 
from the dead to offer eternal life 
reflecting more recent church developments the statement also 
declares that god calls women and men to all ministries of the 
church and makes everyone equally in gods image male and 
female of every race and people to live as one community 
the statement refers to god like a mother who will not forsake 
her nursing child and like a father who runs to welcome the prodigal 
home 
it also says that human beings have exploited nature and 
threatened death to the planet entrusted to our care 
on monday the assembly embroiled in a dispute over the 
distribution of sexually explicit literature to a youth meeting by a 
homosexual caucus decided to take away semiofficial status from 
both some of its severest liberal and conservative critics 
despite criticism that it was trying to reduce voices of dissent 
within the church commissioners voted to delete a part of the 
churchs book of order that gives groups such as presbyterians for 
lesbiangay concerns and presbyterians prolife the right to be 
officially represented at church meetings 
if a majority of the regional presbyteries agree the 
organizations will no longer be attached officially to the 
church said marj carpenter news director of the church 
the 202nd general assembly also monday decided to postpone until 
1991 action on several issues related to abortion and the ordination 
of homosexuals and voted to create a church office for the 
environment 
the issue of homosexuality heated up last summer when 
presbyterians for lesbiangay concerns detailed in brochures the 
sexual practices of homosexuals to high school and college students 
attending a church meeting at purdue university the brochures 
discussed both oral and anal sex and gave explicit instructions in 
the use of condoms 
in the resulting uproar several regional church groups 
petitioned the general assemby to deny official church status to the 
homosexual caucus 
the assembly committee on worship and diversity recommended that 
all organizations with the same semiofficial status including the 
homosexual caucus and the witherspoon society and conservative 
church critics such as the antiabortion group and the presbyterian 
lay committee no longer be accorded official representation within 
the denomination 
the rev robert butcher committee moderator said the sexually 
explicit brochures may have served as a lightning rod for the 
discussion there were concerns within the church that the private 
organizations were perceived as having official standing while 
operating outside the governing bodies of the denomination 
many of these groups are in fact lobbying groups but outside 
the constitutional system of the church he said 
but in a minority report committee member nancy v rodman said 
if the resolution passed we are saying we no longer welcome the 
dissent of our members 
the rev robert davidson of new york city said the church should 
not be appearing to back away from defending the right to dissent at 
a time when freedom of speech is breaking out all over the world 
faced with potentially volatile battles the church voted to wait 
until next year to take action on resolutions dealing with a variety 
of issues on abortion and homosexuality the postponed resolutions 
included one calling for the church to withdraw from the religious 
coalition for abortion rights and one that would have allowed local 
church bodies to ordain practicing homosexuals 
a special task force on human sexuality is expected to report on 
both homosexuality and abortion to the 1991 general assembly the 
church supports legalized abortion and opposes the ordination of 
practicing homosexuals 
in approving a 93page document called restoring creation for 
ecology and justice commissioners voted to establish a 
denominational office on environmental justice and incorporate 
environmental conceketing will continue into the chapter 11 reorganization 
were not surprised about the filing because weve been 
expecting it all along said gary h daughrity executive board 
member of local 1313 amalgamated council of greyhound local unions 
in dallas 
a lot of us cant figure out why it took so long for greyhound 
to seek bankruptcy court protection 
one reason that greyhounds financial woes worsened was that 
fewer striking drivers crossed picket lines than company management 
had anticipated daughrity said 
the company has hired about 3000 replacement drivers and claims 
to have restored service to locations that provided 98 percent of 
revenues last year 
but the drop in ridership and the cost of fighting the sometimes 
violent strike drained the companys cash including a strike fund 
estimated at more than 54 million 
greyhound blamed the strike for much of its 56 million 
firstquarter loss the company also has missed more than 17 
million in interest lease and principal payments putting it in 
default on many financial agreements 
in the past few days there has been a lot of pressure by 
creditors who own buses and terminals and lease them to greyhound 
said president frank schmieder 
under the lease agreements those owners can repossess buses 
immediately after a missed payment spokesman george gravley said 
the company was concerned about possible action by owners of leases 
on 500 to 1000 of the companys 3800 buses 
while most creditors have been cooperative we were faced 
with the threat of a run on assets that would have crippled our 
ability to operate doyle said 
greyhound filed its petition in us bankruptcy court in 
brownsville the filing also includes five affiliated companies 
eagle bus manufacturing co gli bus operations holding co 
buslease inc trailways commuter transit inc and gli food services 
inc greyhounds parent gli holding co was not included 
greyhound has reported scores of shootings bomb threats and 
incidents of vandalism since the strike began a striking driver in 
redding calif was killed on the second day of the walkout after 
being crushed by a bus driven by a replacement 
talks stalled under the companys demand that a week pass without 
violence first the two sides did meet on may 5 but the union 
balked at greyhounds insistence on retaining its newly hired 
drivers and changing from a mileagebased to an hourly wage scale 
on may 7 chairman fred g currey said the strike had become 
irrelevant because the carrier had enough drivers to operate 
two weeks later however the company proposed repurchasing 225 
million of its junk bonds at a steep discount to avert bankruptcy 
schmieder said negotiations are continuing on a debt buyback but 
it will take longer now because the courts will have to approve 
any financial restructuring 
the companys total debt stood at 384 million at the end of 
march the debt is the legacy of a 270 million leveraged buyout led 
by currey three years ago that took the company private a few 
months later the group paid 80 million for dallasbased trailways 
lines inc

jury selection in the drug and perjury trial of 
mayor marion barry entered its second day today as the defense said 
it may call the mayors campaign manager and two members of his 
roundthe clock security detail as witnesses 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy made the disclosure in court as 
the judge in the case began individual questioning of the 250 
potential jurors summoned to us district court 
barry joked with reporters as he arrived on a brilliant spring 
day asking one whether he wanted to play tennis once inside the

draw their sketches for television 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to all 14 of the charges against

she would have trouble presuming barrys innocence 
others included a lawyer a city housing department employee and 
a man who was excused after he said he was preparing to move out of 
the city and that his mother was dying judge thomas penfield 
jackson said he would rule at the end of the day whether those 
questioned would be sent into the jury pool 
in addition to the campaign manager and security guards monday 
said he may call 14 others to testify in support of the mayor the 
names of the two security guards james stays and fred gaskins were 
already included in a questionnaire being given prospective jurors 
in the case mundy said he wanted the names of anita bonds the 
campaign manager and the others added to the list 
law enforcement and city government sources have said that 
prosecutors were on the verge of questioning bonds about a number of 
issues when a grand jury returned a 14count indictment against the 
mayor on may 10 
bonds has said she had not received a subpoena to testify but was 
informed by police officials working on the case that prosecutors 
wished to speak with her 
among those mundy said he may call is daniel butler a 
neighborhood activist who city government sources say has been a 
latenight companion of the mayors for a number of years 
also on the list is david rivers a former top city official and 
close friend of barrys who is currently on trial in the same 
courthouse for allegedly steering city contracts to friends and 
business associates 
the city government sources have said that rivers and his 
codefendant city contractor john clyburn both frequently 
socialized with the mayor 
mundy did not mention rivers by name and he is not on the list 
provided to jurors but when jackson read back a list of possible 
defense witnesses the judge mentioned rivers 
jackson said he hoped to evaluate by the end of the day 50 of the 
250 potential jurors who spent monday filling out a 69question form 
designed to determine whether they can view the case impartially 
the trial is expected to last about a month while jury selection 
could take at least a week 
barry has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocaine possession 
three counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of conspiracy 
the three perjury charges are felonies 
sources close to the case have said barrys lawyers have been 
conducting pleabargain talks with federal prosecutors but one 
source said the two sides are at an impasse the sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a top city official said barry is unwilling to consider pleading 
guilty to a felony perjury charge since that likely would send him 
to jail such a development would bar him from governing or running 
for reelection this november 
thats something he just wont do this source said the 
mayor can read the statute too why sign off on part of a worstcase 
scenario 
there is not a feeling on either side of being under any kind 
of time constraint the source said 
barry has acknowledged he suffers from alcoholism and the 
potential panelists were asked whether they think that could be used 
to excuse criminal activity 
the questionnaire also included a section asking the respondents 
to give their feelings about undercover sting operations the method 
used to produce barrys arrest in addition they were asked whether 
they thought the case against the black mayor was racially or 
politically motivated

earrings may be fine on pirates and punkrockers 
but not on policemen in rural peotone an appellate court ruled 
the 7th us court of appeals ruled monday patrolmen gary zybak 
and marvin rathert cannot wear their ear studs even when off duty 
i really shouldnt comment about the appellate court ruling 
without talking to my attorney but one thing is certain im not 
quitting the force or leaving peotone zybak said monday night in 
a telephone interview 
im very happy here ive been here since 1968 and i consider 
it my hometown 
hometown values prevailed in the appellate decision which upheld 
an earlier ruling by us district judge james holderman in favor of 
police chief gary n bogart and other officials in peotone 45 miles 
south of chicago 
the record shows that even some family members and officer 
colleagues were disturbed by the ear studs as much as were the city 
officials wrote appeals judge harlington wood jr 
it is obvious from the record that the plaintiffs not only 
caused an adverse impact on police discipline esprit de corps and 
uniformity but caused great public dissatisfaction as well 
wood added 
zybak and rathert bought the studs and had their ears pierced in 
december 1986 at a jewelry store in matteson zybak said he and 
rathert were just trying to make an offduty fashion statement 
we didnt mean to wear them on duty but unfortunately when 
you first get your ears pierced you have to keep the studs in for 
about six weeks so they wont close up he said onduty we 
kept bandaids over them but that wasnt good enough i guess 
officials in the town of about 3000 received complaints from 
some of peotones four other fulltime officers residents and even 
ratherts wife 
we both received a strong reprimand about the earrings in 
january 1987 and officer rathert he was a sergeant then was 
demoted and suffered a pay cut said zybak explaining why the two 
men filed a federal lawsuit 
the lawsuit contended the villages real motive was to promote 
conservative or narrowminded views 
wood disagreed 
the important responsibilities of these police officers do not 
include attempting to change the villages political and social 
outlook whatever it may be by wearing ear studs he wrote for 
the threejudge panel 
the court said the ban on ear studs should apply even when the 
men are off duty because the community is small and most people know 
who the officers are even when they are out of uniform 
there is little difference in the way the villages police 
officers are publicly viewed whether their objectionable conduct as 
police officers occurs on duty or off whether they wear the ear 
stud on duty or off the ruling said

under a cloudless sky at high noon the motorcade of mikhail s 
gorbachev purred smoothly over roads lined with palm trees on the 
campus of stanford university 
and the children of an unfettered capitalism wearing sony 
walkmans and riding mountain bikes clamored after it in loud 
pursuit gorbeeeee gorbeeeee gorbeeeee 
under a low angled roof in the ukrainianamerican center on 
minneapolis northeast side a few graying immigrants ate eggs and 
pyrohy dumplings drank strong coffee and gathered up their 
materials to make angry signs then bundled up against unseasonably 
cool june temperatures they headed for neighboring st paul to meet 
the same motorcade 
and when they caught up with it some chanted less flattering 
things wrecker destroyer out of the baltic states 
coming or going conciliatory or sharptongued in the 
sundrenched bay area on monday or the cold drizzle of the upper 
midwest on sunday soviet president mikhail gorbachev never failed 
to draw a crowd 
he could be unpredictable he accommodated knots of screaming 
protesters and smiling families with equal aplomb lingering longest 
among those crowds whose adulation swelled until the secret service 
agents guarding him were red with frustration and the elected 
officials squiring him were green with envy 
in san francisco his wife raisa bolted from the motorcade at 
one point and swooped down unannounced on fishermans wharf 
stepping out of the car just long enough to ring the bell on a cable 
car 
the gorbachevs gave the impression that they went where they 
wanted saw what they wanted and said what they wanted to say 
though many of the impromptu jaunts no doubt were conceived as 
photo opportunities rather than gettingtoknowyou excursions 
their skill and savvy at every turn earned them respect even if it 
sometimes came grudgingly 
at about 3 pm sunday gorbachev nixed a scheduled visit to a 
family farm outside minneapolis inside the hubert humphrey 
metrodome which had been converted into a media center for the 
visit a harried secret service agent put down his radio and threw 
up his hands 
the guy is a nightmare jumps out of the car when he wants to 
and strolls any place he feels like youve seen the things in the 
newspapers about us not knowing whats going on well he said 
theyre true 
if that was the case a reporter asked who was calling the shots 
the agent looked toward the oversized tv screen high above the 
wall in left centerfield on it the gorbachev motorcade was 
pictured zooming back toward downtown 
id bet its him the agent said the guy in the car

halfway down palm drive his wheelchair braced against the curb 
john looper sat patiently monday and scanned the slowing string of 
black zil limousines 
ten years ago looper lost the use of his legs in a motorcycle 
accident but it slowed him very little two hours ago hed parked 
at the edge of the stanford campus and unceremoniously wheeled two 
miles to reach this vantage point 
when the 30yearold software engineer told colleagues why he was 
taking the day off a few chuckled and a few others told him to 
catch the traveling gorbachevs on tv 
but looper would not be dissuaded this bit of history he was 
determined to catch himself in the span of a breath the familiar 
face appeared at the open window caught his eye waved and just as 
quickly moved on 
as the roller skates and bicycles skateboards and motor scooters 
rumbled past on the sidewalk looper began the twomile trip back 
it was worth it he said we watch tv so much that so many 
of the things you see just dont seem real any more 
i felt like i had to see the man this is a pivotal point in 
history who knows whats going to happen in the future i support 
what gorbachev is doing and with public opinion what it is back 
home i figure he could use the help 
but there are selfish reasons too when i see him in the 
history books 20 years from now looper said im going to be 
able to tell my kids that we exchanged waves

at minnesota gov rudy perpichs residence two blocks down on the 
auspiciously named summit avenue chefs were making final 
preparations for gorbachevs lunch while pacifist jean remke and 
several of the women with whom she shares a mansion were stringing 
together quilted panels for a peace ribbon to wrap around the 
outside of their home 
many of the panels with their pastoral scenes of nature and 
families had been part of the peace ribbon unveiled in washington 
in 1985 and in one of the more creative protests against the arms 
race used to encircle the pentagon several subsequently were 
presented to the gorbachevs at a ussoviet summit 
some people laughed then but i think its done good virgina 
hessian mulvaney said gorbachev is here and nuclear weapons are 
on the way out 
she went on to explain that her daughter was born on the same day 
of a sputnik launch by the soviets and how that fateful coincidence 
inspired her to conceive a poem about peaceful coexistence even as 
she lay on a delivery table in the labor room 
ever since she remained convinced that this day of cooperation 
between the superpowers would come and last week she was the first 
caller on a radio show taping messages to forward to the gorbachevs 
she recited as much of the poem as time would allow 
but ms mulvaney admitted a moment later that she was discouraged 
to learn not all minnesotans were viewing the historic visit with 
the same seriousmindedness the second caller simply joked about 
cleaning his house if gorbachev agreed to stop by 
and the third she added more disheartened only talked 
about taking him fishing

if jim wright has any regrets about 
resigning as house speaker hes not saying so and they arent 
showing 
he looks tanned and relaxed in his fort worth office which is 
cluttered by papers and memorabilia from 34 years in congress along 
with notes for the book he is writing on central america 
wright says he hasnt been happier in years and talks without 
bitterness about his resignation a year ago during an ethics 
investigation 
i have a sort of predestinarians view of things almost a 
religious conviction that things happen for the better and i just 
accept it that way wright said in a recent interview 
wright delivered his resignation speech to the house on may 31 
1989 six days later he officially gave up the post he had held for 
about two years he left congress on june 30 
he stepped down after the house ethics committee said wright 
violated house rules 69 times involving sales of his book 
reflections of a public man and in business deals with his 
friend george mallick of fort worth 
wright maintains the charges were false and brought by his 
enemies he insists that he never knowingly violated house rules he 
said events leading to his resignation fell together to create 
this jigsaw puzzle out of which there was no escape 
but wright said his fall from power did allow him an escape of 
sorts hes now free to do things that were impossible in 
washington such as having dinner with his wife betty and spending 
time with his children and grandchildren 
the 67yearold wright still works long days writing giving 
speeches or guest lectures at colleges and appearing at 
fundraisers for fellow democrats he recently attended a gathering 
for his replacement pete geren who often consults wright for 
advice 
an avid gardener wright spent a recent weekend planting 52 rose 
bushes in his back yard and had a few sore muscles 
im happy im as busy as i want to be and im not nearly as 
busy as i used to be im very glad im not he said during my 
last 12 years in congress i was running to catch up it was a 
constant choice between most urgent and merely urgent and the 
simply important never got done 
wrights study in his new threebedroom home contains few signs 
of his tenure in washington which he says at times was 
oppressive hectic harried harassing 
he refuses to criticize his successor speaker tom foley or the 
house except to say its not moving with any discernible clarity 
or purpose 
he still believes actions by his nemesis republican rep newt 
gingrich and special prosecutor richard phelan amounted to 
character assassination 
and wright blames the media for a voracious thirst for 
scandal he says reporters didnt give him a chance to tell his 
side 
during the past year mallick went to bankruptcy court and 
liquidated the company that was under house investigation 
mrs wright whose job with the company mallightco was 
questioned by the ethics committee is less circumspect than her 
husband in assessing the investigation 
i think that it leaves scars i dont think theres any way to 
get away from it she said 
wright said he sometimes yearns to be involved when he sees 
reports about such things as the crumbling of the berlin wall or 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs visit to the united states 
but there are other people who can do those things i had my 
chance i had 34 years and thats plenty i did everything i could 
do and the best i could do he said

nomination from delegates to the new york state democratic 
convention

obstacles

orchestrated twoday gathering

far are the ideas the emphasis and the commitment that will carry 
us the rest of the way no matter how far that is said cuomo 57

overriding issue would be the future what do you do about the 
21st century and how do you get us there who has the capacity to 
get us there 
asked if that didnt have a presidential ring to it cuomo 
scoffed 
youre so full of baloney said the governor 
last week new york republicans chose manhattan economist pierre 
rinfret a 66yearold political unknown to challenge cuomo 
the governor announced his reelection plans sunday during a 
visit to campaign workers preparing for the convention 
former vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro told 
reporters that if cuomo wanted it he could get the democratic 
nomination for president in 1992 
she said democrats she has talked to believe that he can be the 
person who can carry the democrats to the white house in 1992

kirghizian city on the border with uzbekistan 
the fighting began monday over a land disupte between the two 
predominantly moslem ethnic groups soviet troops were unable to 
control the situation 
it was the latest outbreak of ethnic fighting in the soviet union 
and occurred as president mikhail s gorbachev was concluding his 
summit in the unites states and returned to face an array of 
domestic troubles 
battles continued tuesday between groups numbering between 200 
and 600 the interfax news agency reported it said among the dead 
were a master sergeant of the interior ministry troops and a police 
cadet 
the situation is very grave and its getting worse said 
khalil tashmatov head of the osh branch of the interior ministry 
in a telephone interview there are cases of pogroms and houses 
being burned down he said 
he said soviet troops were trying to maintain order but there 
arent enough of them 
at least seven houses were set ablaze along with eight cars 
monday night in the city of about 210000 according to reports from 
tass and interfax which is affiliated with staterun radio moscow 
at least 51 people were arrested and a 10 pm to 6 am curfew 
was in force in osh interior ministry troops patrolled the streets 
setting up roadblocks and guarding industrial sites tass and 
interfax said 
maj gen viktor goncharov the interior minister of kirghizia 
was appointed military commander of the region they said 
the dispute reportedly centered on plots of land claimed by both 
sides near the city which has central asias largest silk factory 
kirghizia lies in the tien shan and pamir mountains and borders 
western china 
a group of kirghiz who wanted new housing occupied the land to 
begin constructing houses uzbeks who make up 30 percent of the 
population demanded they also receive land for housing tass said 
tashmatov accused activists of a group known as osaimagy the 
kirghiz word for circle of claiming the land illegally and sparking 
the dispute 
housing is critically short in the republics of central asia 
earlier violence in the region was triggered in part by fears that 
the government had plans to give apartments to refugees fleeing 
ethnic unrest in other parts of the country 
interfax and tass said about 10000 uzbeks gathered monday to 
protest in the field of a collective farm and faced off against 
about 1500 kirghiz 
premier apas dzhumagulov of kirghizia communist party secretary 
medetkan sherimkulov and other officials spoke to them and tried to 
calm the situation but at about 6 pm a large group of kirghiz 
came to the site the news services said 
a group of about 900 interior ministry troops and local police 
fired blanks to disperse the crowd they reported but groups 
rampaged through the city setting fires and trying to attack 
interior ministry headquarters 
of the 200 injured 111 were hospitalized some with bullet 
wounds tass and interfax said among the injured were 21 police 
officers 
emoldened by gorbachevs reforms residents of central asian 
republics such as kirghizia and uzbekistan have been expressing 
their religious ethnic political and economic concerns some have 
vented their frustrations through violence 
there has been ethnic violence in tadzhikistan and soviet 
soldiers remain in the republics of armenia and azerbaijan to 
control ethnic violence that has wracked the two republics for two 
years

rep dan burton is a popular figure at charity 
golf tournaments where hes among a small circle of lawmakers who 
get free flights meals and lodging for being a celebrity player 
tournament sponsors and airlines pay for the tickets food and 
hotel rooms lawmakers who love golf get the perk even if theyre 
not the national celebrities charity tournaments like to attract 
house financial disclosure records released last week showed that 
burton an indiana republican without a national following 
participated in six tournaments in 1989 
others with multiple appearances at such tournaments include rep 
marty russo dill rep dan rostenkowski the illinois democrat 
who chairs the house ways and means committee and minority leader 
bob michel also from illinois 
the trips are examples of the lifestyle that members of congress 
may live partially at others expense within the rules of the 
house and senate 
house members last year got free trips lodging and meals for 
going conferences at floridas fivestar boca raton resort the 
island of st croix palm springs calif montego bay jamaica and 
a mountain retreat in switzerland 
members of congress who like to play golf when theyre not in 
session and theres no business in the district can help charity 
and have fun burton said its a respite we really enjoy

palm springs in january the kemper open in washington in may the 
larry bird youth links tournament in indianapolis his district in

three and michel in two 
russos disclosure showed he received roundtrip air 
transportation from chicago to west palm beach fla five days 
lodging and travel expenses to take part in the chrysler team 
championship golf tournament 
the records show that golf outings and more traditional trips to 
conferences sponsored by specialinterest groups often appear more 
valuable than the 2000 per speech that lawmakers may earn for 
addressing those organizations 
the free perks will become even more precious to house members 
jan 1 when honoraria will be banned in return for a hefty pay 
raise 
this year house members are allowed to earn the same amount of 
honoraria as last year 26850 senators are still allowed 
honoraria and may keep it until the figure reaches 40 percent of

from washington north carolinas eastern shore 
it was just a disaster to be honest he said 
the invited lawmakers came late and left early because of 
changing events in washington just a short flight away even when 
they attended the seminars clark said they spent half their time

president bush paid tribute tuesday to the 
peacetime gi bill saying the college benefits are helping the armed 
forces attract better recruits than ever 
the rose garden ceremony honored the program as the number of 
participants reached the 1 million mark 
bush who was among the first wave of veterans to head off to 
college on the original gi bill said the version enacted in 1984 is 
an important component in the success of americas allvolunteer 
forces 
it allows recruits on active duty or the reserves to draw a basic 
benefit of up to 10800 for college in part by having their pay 
reduced by 100amonth for 12 months 
among those attending were defense secretary dick cheney rep 
gv sonny montgomery dmiss the chief sponsor of the 
legislation secretary of transportation samuel skinner top 
military brass 
a dozen enlisted men and women from the army air force navy 
marines coast guard national guard and the reserves joined bush on 
stage as representatives of the 1 million program participants 
the montgomery gi bill provides up to 300 a month in benefits 
for fulltime students but montgomery wants to raise the monthly 
stipend to 400 
bush a close friend of montgomerys said the gi bill ranks 
among the most practical and costefficient programs ever devised 
cheney called it crucial for recruitment and retention he said 
reserves were twice as likely to stay in the reserves in 198588 
if they were saving for college 
the size of our force may come down in the future but quality 
must remain at the absolute top cheney said the gi bill will 
help us do that 
bush a navy torpedo bomber pilot in world war ii said he was 
among the first 40000 veterans to use the gi bill when he went to 
yale in 1945 
the gi bill changed the lives of millions by replacing old 
roadblocks with paths of opportunity really it changed the life 
of our nation bush said 
the pentagon says 712 percent of all activeduty service members 
have chosen to participate in the montgomery program over the past 
year it will cost 412 million in fiscal 1991

the soviet legislature on tuesday tentatively 
postponed adoption of a law to ease restrictions on emigration 
possibly jeopardizing a summit deal that would vastly increase trade 
with the united states 
president mikhail s gorbachev signed the trade agreement during 
this weeks washington summit with president bush bushs only 
condition for implementing the trade agreement was that the soviet 
legislature give final approval to the longawaited emigration law 
but the supreme soviet on tuesday approved an agenda that does 
not include consideration of the law in its current session which 
ends june 14 the supreme soviet does not convene again until 
september 
the proposed law would permit emigration for virtually anyone who 
has entry permission from another country and no outstanding 
obligations criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets 
it would set a basic limit of five years on the length of time a 
citizen can be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets 
there was no explanation for the decision to omit the item from 
the agenda and legislators held out the possibility it could still 
be added during the current session 
we will look it over and if there is a possibility we will 
include this issue we will look it over with the president said 
anatoly lukyanov the chairman of the legislatures executive 
committee gorbachev returned to moscow on tuesday 
reform has allowed lawmakers to criticize the leadership but 
gorbachev and lukyanov his close ally almost without exception 
have managed to bend the legislature to their will 
it was not clear whether postponement of the law was made with 
gorbachevs approval whether it was a mistake or whether other 
kremlin leaders engineered the decision possibly to embarrass the 
absent leader 
the unexpected step could signal that gorbachev intends to make 
good on his warning that he might curtail jewish emigration if 
israel continues to settle emigres in occupied territory 
jewish activists in moscow issued a statement tuesday protesting 
the threat which gorbachev made at a news conference in washington 
on sunday 
soviet authorities have no moral or legal right to dictate to a 
sovereign government where jews who have lost their soviet 
citizenship should live said the statement read over the 
telephone by spokesman oleg nesterov 
the statement called the threat one of a series of attempts to 
use jews as an object of trade in a political game 
another possible reason for the delay might be that the soviets 
are not prepared to handle the number of people wanting to emigrate 
and the demands they will place on transport and visa workers 
the government may also be hesitating because an embarassingly 
high number of people could choose to leave their country 
passage of the emigration law would affect an unknown number of 
soviets including jews and other ethnic groups without it the 
soviet union will not have access to million dollars in trade with 
the united states under the summit agreement 
the decision to delay consideration angered some soviet lawmakers 
we will turn out to be cheats we wont be trusted they will 
say well they made a promise and again the soviet union is 
deceiving said nikolai medvedev a legislator from lithuania he 
said soviet officials had promised us senators during the summit 
that the new emigration law would be approved before the legislative 
session ends this month 
fyodor burlatsky a member of the legislatures international 
affairs committee said in a television interview recently the law 
would be considered may 31 
the law passed on its first reading in november but final action 
has been delayed repeatedly by crises over other economic and 
political reforms 
referring to potential lost trade with the united states supreme 
soviet member igor griazin of estonia said there are fairly 
serious economic consequences to not adopting the law on entry and 
exit 
rudolf a kuznetsov head of the visaissuing agency uvir has 
predicted 5 million to 6 million of the 287 million soviets would 
emigrate or travel abroad this year 
last month alone soviet authorities issued about 20000 exit 
visas 
the bill under consideration would codify many changes that have 
already been put into practice here for example procedures 
required to obtain travel documents and permission to emigrate have 
been eased tremendously in the last two years 
soviet officials acknowledge that the main obstacles to travel 
have become the heavy workloads of emigration authorities shortages 
of plane and train tickets and problems with currency exchange 
currently soviet citizens are allowed to exchange about 300 when 
they go abroad on a guest or tourist visa and this puts a strain on 
the financially strapped soviet union

president roh taewoo said tuesday he 
hoped his unprecedented talks with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev would lead to full diplomatic ties between the nations and 
peace on the divided korean peninsula 
the meeting monday between roh and gorbachev in san francisco was 
heralded by many as a boost to south koreas international prestige 
but radical students denounced rohs diplomatic overtures to 
communist nations 
in a statement roh called the encounter the first between a 
south korean and a soviet leader the greatest diplomatic event 
in south koreas modern history 
roh said he hoped normal bilateral relations between our 
countries would follow moscow is a longtime ally of seouls 
archenemy communist north korea 
no dates were announced for establishing diplomatic relations 
but a roh aide said that could be expected in the notdistant 
future 
the south korean newspaper donga ilbo said roh agreed to send 
foreign minister choi hojoong to moscow by july it quoted 
highranking officials as saying full diplomatic ties could be 
established by september 
roh said south korea would also devote efforts to establishing 
ties with china also a major ally of north korea 
rohs announcement was welcomed by most south koreans who want 
to see an easing of hostilities with the communist north the koreas 
were divided in 1945 fought a bloody war in the early 1950s and 
remain bitter enemies 
the summit meeting has not only been a turning point in 
relations between the two countries but has also been an 
epochmaking event that will see an end to the cold war legacy on 
the korean peninsula roh said in the statement 
the nations two television networks devoted five hours of live 
satellite and local coverage to rohs visit 
rohs opponents however were critical of rohs diplomatic 
maneuver and dissidents said he was trying to escape an internal 
crisis by diverting attention to foreign affairs 
a major alliance of dissident groups said rohs diplomacy was 
subservient and that the talks failed to present substantial 
measures for peace 
radical students on tuesday staged scattered protests against 
roh they called for free contacts across the heavily fortified 
border and unification with north korea 
in southern kwangju 2000 students fought police with firebombs 
and rocks outside five campuses according to yonhap the south 
korean news agency 
roh has been pursuing a policy of establishing ties with current 
and former communist nations to isolate north korea south korea now 
maintains relations with all countries in east europe except albania 
and east germany 
south korea hopes diplomatic ties with the soviet union and china 
will greatly enhance its international prestige and gain acceptance 
for seoul as an asian and world power 
the governing democratic liberal party called the rohgorbachev 
talks the historic first chapter of normalization of relations 
with the soviet union 
the fact that the two met face to face is very important to 
us said dr rhee sangwoo a government adviser and dean at 
seouls sogang university regardless of the subjects discussed 
the fact they met is most important 
the party for peace and democracy the main opposition party 
welcomed the prospect of normalizing relations with moscow but 
criticized roh for taking a low profile 
its regrettable president roh did not bring up other 
issues including a soviet apology for shooting down a south 
korean passenger plane in 1983 a party statement said 
korea was divided when soviet and us troops ended japans 
colonial rule the division deepened after the 195053 korean war 
technically the two koreas are still at war with no peace treaty 
signed 
the border is the most heavily fortified in the world it is 
sealed by more than 1 million armed soldiers on either side 
stationed behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire

the size of the black middle class has nearly 
tripled over the past 30 years but living standards and 
opportunities for minorities still need much improvement a group of 
corporate and academic leaders said tuesday 
a report released by the businesshigher education forum said 
also that while more than onethird of american blacks and hispanics 
would be considered middle class about 30 percent of minorities 
live in poverty and that percentage is growing it said also that 
minorities are still much more likely to be poor than whites 
forum leaders called for comprehensive efforts to improve living 
conditions and opportunities for minorities 
i think we have to work at a variety of ways to do this and if 
it finally comes down to higher taxes are the only answer i think 
weve got to deal with that issue said steven mason a 
cochairman of the task force that prepared the report 
the report three realities minority life in the united 
states said racism poor educational attainment restricted 
business opportunities and the stranglehold of the inner city 
limit minorities hopes for improving their economic lots 
the report called for restructuring public assistance programs 
such as public housing food stamps and job training as well as 
changing student financial aid programs it also proposed a number 
of other reforms 
the changes said the group of more than 90 heads of fortune 500 
corporations and leading colleges and universities should bolster 
the countrys growing minority middle class and improve living 
standards and opportunities for unskilled blacks hispanics and 
other poor people 
mason and cochairman clifton wharton said the majority of the 
forum members would accept a tax increase to pay for the proposed 
changes but acknowledged it is unclear whether the majority 
included most of the corporate members of the forum 
i cant speak for all the top executives in the country i can 
only really speak for one said mason president of the mead corp 
my conviction is that these issues are important enough that they 
have to be funded 
wharton head of teachers insurance annuity association of 
america and the college retirement equities fund said the forums 
report focuses on three categories of blacks and hispanics those 
in the middle class those at the margin and those living in 
poverty 
the report found 
more than onethird of all blacks and hispanics would be 
considered middle class the study said 60 percent of whites fit 
that category 
nearly half of all blacks own their homes about 15 million 
blacks work as managers business executives and professionals 
nearly 7000 blacks are elected officials 
in 1987 36 percent of black families had annual incomes of at 
least 25000 among hispanic families 40 percent were in that 
income bracket and owned their homes more than 3700 hispanics hold 
elective office 
between 25 and 30 percent of all minorities are living at the 
margin most of them are either semiskilled or unskilled workers 
who while holding jobs earn minimum wage moonlight qualify for 
some public aid cannot afford health insurance but do not qualify 
for medicaid and rarely receive adequate help from food stamps and 
unemployment programs 
about 30 percent of minorities live in poverty and that 
percentage is growing the poverty rate for blacks was nearly three 
times that for whites in 1986 between 1970 and 1980 the poorest 
population in the five largest cities grew 161 percent 
to help the working poor and impoverished move up the ladder the 
report recommended that the purchasing power of public employment 
and training programs keep pace with inflation 
the forum also called for full teenage employment by the turn of 
the century and full funding of the popular preschool programs head 
start and chapter one for poor youngsters officials said lowincome 
families should be informed when their children are young of 
financial assistance opportunities for college and institutions and 
the federal government should use grants instead of loans to pay for 
the first two years of college 
in addition the forum said corporations should expand minority 
recruitment for all positions 
we argue that the civil rights issue in the united states has 
changed profoundly in the last 25 years mason said we are 
walking on new ground a generation ago our concern was primarily 
political equality today the primary issue is economic equity

the proposed soviet emigration law would allow 
emigration for virtually anyone who has permission to enter another 
country and no outstanding obligations criminal charges or recent 
knowledge of state secrets in the soviet union 
it would also set a basic limit of five years on the length of 
time a citizen can be kept from emigrating because of access to 
secrets 
complete details of the proposal are not known but the bill 
which was given preliminary approval by the supreme soviet in 
november codifies many changes already put into practice in the 
soviet union 
the procedures required to obtain travel documents and permission 
to emigrate have already been eased a great deal in the last two 
years releasing a flood of visitors and emigrants across the soviet 
borders 
soviet officials acknowledge that the main obstacles to travel 
have become the heavy workloads of emigration authorities shortages 
of plane and train tickets and problems with currency exchange 
the financially strapped country can ill afford to allocate hard 
currency for citizens to spend abroad officials say now soviet 
citizens are allowed to exchange rubles for about 300 when they go 
abroad on a guest or tourist visa 
before the current liberalization of travel regulations tens of 
thousands of jews and other soviets were refused exit visas 
becoming known as refuseniks their plight brought repeated 
censure from the west 
because there has been no legal limit on how long a person could 
be denied exit on the grounds he knew state secrets there have been 
cases of refuseniks being denied visas for up to 20 years 
activists say there are still dozens if not hundreds of 
refuseniks held because of state secrets or because relatives have 
refused to sign papers giving them permission to leave 
but most former refuseniks have left and less than 1 percent of 
applications to emigrate are currently being turned down according 
to visa officials

point roberts on the tip of a peninsula can be reached only by 
boat or by roads through british columbia its about 25 miles from 
the canadaus border crossing at blaine about 100 miles north of 
seattle 
so when striking truckers set up border blockades on friday 
gasoline grocery and other delivery trucks from the united states 
couldnt get through to stores that serve its 750 residents 
a tentative settlement was announced monday in the strike by 
3000 independent truckers that began may 27 but strikers said it 
doesnt meet their pay demands a vote on the agreement was 
scheduled for late tuesday 
the blockade was lifted tuesday morning after royal canadian 
mounted police using a court order cleared the trucks 
beer trucks are rolling and the milk truck hopefully is en 
route said lisa jackson coowner of bens department store a 
62yearold institution that once was point roberts only business 
at the marketplace supermarket manager mike schouten said 
suppliers were rushing up meat produce and dairy products 
i will try to carry a little extra on hand but you cant put 
two weeks worth of milk in the cooler schouten said tuesday 
the days without deliveries brought out out of gas signs at 
service stations schouten was limiting milk to one gallon per 
customer 
some people were hoarding eight to 10 gallons at a time he 
said 
the store had hired private fishing boats to bring limited 
supplies of perishable goods and schouten said he planned to keep 
those channels open in case the border closed again 
im crossing my fingers and really hoping for the best but when 
youre dealing with this type of situation you never know what will 
happen he said 
point roberts residents can drive a few miles to the suburbs of 
vancouver british columbia to buy supplies but the prices are 
higher 
in point roberts gasoline costs half as much as in canada and 
cigarettes and other products are also generally cheaper said cindy 
hammer another owner of bens department store the store ran out 
of gas and many of its customers on sunday she said 
the local chevron station closed saturday and reopened monday 
when owner jack graham purchased 9000 gallons of gasoline from a 
canadian supplier 
the blockade highlighted the difficulties for towns residents 
who live in isolation from the us mainland and have to cross one 
border into canada and another back into the united states to reach 
the rest of their country 
the treaty establishing the 49th parallel as the border between 
canada and the united states left the tiny town to the united states 
there is no school so students are bused across the borders to 
blaine for classes each day 
residents rely on tourists drawn by a beautiful coastline and 
canadians looking to save money by shopping in the united states 
some like it and some dont said postmaster dean nelson 
it gets to them sitting in the border lineups 
even local government becomes complicated point roberts is in 
whatcom county the county seat of bellingham is about 50 miles and 
two borders away 
it took us two years to get a blinking light at a busy 
intersection said shelley damewood who works at the post office 
now were trying to get a stop sign 
the proposed settlement covering 60 of 180 trucking companies 
involved in the dispute was announced monday by bryan williams the 
strikes chief mediator for the government of british columbia 
williams did not disclose terms of mondays agreement but bruce 
butler a member of the western owner operators association which 
represents the independent drivers said it would boost hauling 
rates to 35 an hour canadian or 5 less than the strikers sought

federal safety officials on tuesday blamed a 
shifting river channel for the 1989 collapse of a tennessee highway 
bridge that killed eight motorists but investigators said state 
officials should have corrected the problem a decade ago 
the national transportation safety board expressing concern 
about thousands of other bridges throughout the country also cited 
the 54yearold structures simple design as a contributing factor 
in the april 1 1989 collapse the bridge carried the two 
northbound lanes of us 51 over the hatchie river 45 miles north 
of memphis 
the board cited the tennessee department of transportation for 
failing to evaluate and correct problems found in inspections dating 
back to 1979 the river channel has moved 83 feet since the bridge 
was constructed in 1936 investigators said 
the board voted 31 on the probable cause and 40 on a set of 
recommendations to federal and state officials board member jim 
burnett said he would not support the conclusion until further 
inspection after missing bridge parts are recovered 
the boards investigation remains open said chairman james 
kolstad and could be revised if evidence surfaces that points to 
further deficiencies in the bridge investigators told the board 
that bridge parts might be raised from the water in about two weeks 
kolstad said tennessee officials need to improve their 
inspections and maintenance procedures they recognized the problem 
but they did not evaluate it they did not take action to correct 
the situation kolstad said 
he said recent flooding in the south increases the danger of 
bridges being undermined 
im concerned that some of these bridges may be put back into 
service without adequate inspection kolstad said 
the board said it was unlikely that a fracture in any of the 
concrete columns of the tennessee bridge triggered the collapse 
it said the bridge failed most likely from the deterioration 
of timber piles that were originally buried and not designed to be 
in water the fact that the piles were improperly exposed to the 
river channel was known as early as 1979 inspectors said 
the ntsb staff also had blamed the accident partly on 
construction of an adjacent bridge in 1974 to carry us 51s 
southbound lanes which their draft report said accelerated the 
shift in the river channel but the board said the collapse would 
have occurred eventually even without the new bridge and deleted 
the southbound bridge as a contributing factor 
the final report said however enough information and guidance 
was available for the designers of the southbound bridge to have 
discovered the natural channel meander of the hatchie river and to 
have anticipated that further migration would undermine the 
northbound bridge 
the report said the drivers of passenger cars and trucks on the 
bridge had no way of avoiding the accident it also said emergency 
crews could have done nothing more to reduce its severity 
board members also cautioned tennessee authorities against 
allowing so many exemptions to vehicle weight restrictions on 
bridges about 70 a month for the hatchie bridge before it 
collapsed and called for closer scrutiny of overweight trucks and 
their impact on bridge safety

the government came under fierce pressure tuesday 
to rescue nazi war crimes legislation thrown out by the house of 
lords 
prime minister margaret thatcher facing angry lawmakers in the 
house of commons said she recognized the extremely strong 
feelings because of the hideous nature of these crimes 
however she made no commitment to invoke a rarely used 
parliamentary act and force the bill through the unelected house of 
lords which consists of hereditary peers judges church leaders 
and politicians given lifetime titles the bill which would have 
allowed prosecution of elderly suspected war criminals living in 
britain was passed in the commons in december mrs thatcher voted 
in favor of the legislation 
the war crimes bill was supposed to become law in july but the 
lords voted 20774 on tuesday to defeat it 
we will be considering very carefully how best to proceed 
bearing in mind the size of the majority in this house on a free 
vote mrs thatcher told lawmakers it may be that the house 
itself will wish to discuss the matter 
the governments options are to abandon the bill have the house 
of commons vote on whether to reintroduce it or simply reintroduce 
it in the fall the government has not revived a bill voted down in 
the house of lords since 1949 
it is rare for the lords to vote against proposed legislation 
traditionally it revises clauses in legislation but does not reject 
outright commons bills 
the lords powers are limited to delaying measures for a year and 
they could not reject the bill a second time 
the simon wiesenthal center which submitted a list of nazi 
suspects to the government in 1986 said it was deeply upset at 
the lords vote 
i think it is unthinkable that this country which suffered so 
much at the hands of the nazis continues to give a haven to some of 
hitlers worst henchmen said ephraim zuroff head of the israeli 
section of the los angelesbased wiesenthal center 
opponents of the bill in the house of lords argued that it would 
be impossible to hold fair trials after 50 years and that 
prosecutions would amount to show trials of old men and stir up 
old hatreds 
the vote left britain the only one of the world war ii allied 
powers without laws to prosecute suspected war criminals 
australia canada and the united states countries with legal 
systems not dissimilar to our own who do not take second place to 
us with regard to human rights have legislated long ago 
legislator sir bernard braine declared in the commons 
jewish groups also demanded revival of the bill 
a governmentappointed commission that investigated the 
wiesenthal list of nazi war criminals recommended speedy 
prosecutions for three suspects and said another 124 cases should be 
investigated 
the suspects allegedly helped round up and murder thousands of 
jews in nazioccupied soviet republics 
the commission kept the suspects names confidential 
the only one repeatedly identified in the british media 
lithuanianborn antanas gecas 74 acknowledges serving in an 
auxiliary police battalion but says he took no part in atrocities 
and claims to be the victim of a soviet smear campaign 
a 1 million libel suit brought by gecas a retired mining 
engineer who lives in scotland against the times of london was 
settled tuesday before going to trial in edinburgh 
the times said it had wrongly identified gecas as an officer of 
hitlers notorious ss and as the member of a specialist murder 
squad the times said it agreed to make a contribution to gecas 
legal fees but was not paying him any damages 
i am not only dismayed i am disgusted said lord cocks a 
labor peer who supported the bill the house of lords has 
gratuitously stirred up this constitutional issue of the lords vs 
the commons 
lord mayhew 74 a leading opponent of the bill said its a 
good day for the house of lords frankly i dont think the 
government are going to bring it the bill forward again 
like many of the lords opposed to prosecution mayhew served as 
an officer in world war ii 
he helped liberate the belsen concentration camp as the nazis 
retreated in 1945 saw top nazis sentenced to death at the postwar 
trials in nuremberg and screened other war criminals for deportation 
and death in communist countries 
i dont regret it he said in the debate monday night but 
it was plain then plain beyond any doubt that this grim process of 
retribution could not go on forever

mikhail s gorbachev returned from the united 
states on tuesday triumphantly bearing trade and arms deals but 
facing ethnic bloodshed in central asia an impasse with the baltic 
republics and trouble in the kremlin 
in gorbachevs absence his nemesis boris n yeltsin was elected 
president of russia the largest soviet republic yeltsin 
immediately called for the resignation of the soviet cabinet and a 
new constitution that would vastly reduce the powers of the central 
government 
in the distant reaches of soviet central asia two turkic groups 
clashed tuesday for the second day along the border between 
uzbekistan and kirghizia authorities declared a state of emergency 
and said 11 people were killed 
along the baltic coast prime minister kazimiera prunskiene of 
the secssionist republic of lithuania reassured her compatriots that 
american sympathizers would try to block congress from endorsing a 
ussoviet trade deal signed at the summit 
and within the ancient red brick walls of the kremlin the 
supreme soviet legislature unexpectedly postponed consideration of 
the emigration law that president bush set as a precondition for 
implementing the trade pact 
it was not clear whether the postponement was instigated by 
gorbachev who warned sunday that he might curb emigration of soviet 
jews if they continue to settle on lands occupied by israel during 
the 1967 mideast war 
the trade deal which drew immediate criticism from members of 
the us congress was an unexpected summit triumph for the soviet 
president 
bush had said previously he would not sign the agreement until 
gorbachev lifted the economic sanctions he imposed against lithuania 
after it declared independence march 11 american lawmakers chided 
bush for stretching too far to help gorbachev who has left the 
sanctions in place and refused to negotiate with lithuanians until 
they suspend their declaration 
the soviet leader also has decreed that the other two baltic 
republics estonia and latvia violated the soviet constitution by 
taking less bold steps toward independence but he has not been able 
to bring them back into the fold 
staterun soviet television and centrally published newspapers 
gave blanket coverage to gorbachevs trip hailing the agreements he 
signed to eliminate superpower chemical weapons and complete a 
treaty to slash longrange nuclear arsenals 
the official media also stressed gorbachevs personal rapport 
with bush and with the crowds of americans who cheered and applauded 
the soviet leader at every stop 
what we would like to have a special say about is the 
establishing of good personal relations between the soviet and 
american presidents the importance of which could hardly be 
overestimated reported pravda the organ of the communist party 
the newspaper devoting nearly its entire front page to 
gorbachevs us visit emphasized the purely human 
compatibility evident between gorbachev and bush and said it made 
it possible to create a favorable atmosphere for searching 
together and finding constructive solutions 
central television continued its upbeat coverage of gorbachevs 
swing across the united states showing the kremlin chief meeting 
with a beaming former president ronald reagan and bantering with 
jubilant american crowds 
the main evening television new program vremya opened at 9 pm 
tuesday with footage of gorbachevs presidential airplane touching 
down at vnukovo 2 airport it then broadcast the speech the soviet 
leader delivered to cheering students in california on monday 
in moscow the mood of rebellion was spreading to the very center 
of soviet power the congress of peoples deputies of the russian 
federation met in the kremlin and elected yeltsin as its president 
may 29 the day gorbachev departed moscow 
gorbachev had opposed yeltsins election saying his plan to 
shift economic and political decisionmaking from the central 
government to the russian republic could lead to the disintegration 
of th soviet union 
but gennady gerasimov and vitaly churkin spokesmen traveling 
with gorbachev tried to put the best face on yeltsins election 
saying it could help the soviet leader accelerate the pace of 
reforms 
gorbachevs latest reform package was foundering during his 
absence as shoppers continued the rush on stores they began after 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov announced an economic reform 
package that would triple the price of bread on july 1 and double 
the cost of most other food starting jan 1 
yeltsin in a kremlin news conference wednesday called for 
ryzhkovs resignation criticized the price hikes and demanded 
faster transition to a market economy 
gorbachev may have a chance to regain the initiative in domestic 
affairs in an address he is scheduled to deliver on his trip to the 
two houses of the soviet legislature sometime this week the day for 
the speech has not been announced

scientific sleuths can rest easy a queens 
college professor says hes solved the decadesold mystery of who 
masterminded the 1912 piltdown man fraud and it wasnt sir arthur 
conan doyle 
the sherlock holmes author was one of the more colorful 
suspects named over the years as perpetrating a hoax that threw 
many paleontologists off the trail of what is now recognized as the 
course of human evolution 
others included several noted scientists a counterfeit jeweler 
and a philosopherpriest 
but frank spencer an anthropologist who has worked on the famous 
whodunit since the 1970s said in a telephone interview tuesday 
there was never any proof linking the usual suspects 
he says diary entries and other information uncovered 
independently by himself and australian historian ian langham points 
the finger squarely at sir arthur keith a wellrespected english 
anatomist 
the langhamspencer theory is laid out in two books to be 
published this fall by oxford university press langham who worked 
at the university of sydney died in 1984 his widow asked spencer 
to continue his work 
piltdown a small village in england made international news in 
1912 when a skull and other artifacts were discovered by sussex 
lawyer charles dawson in a gravel pit 
it was sensational because it offered a completely different 
view of evolution at the time spencer said 
for those who believed that humans with already enlarged brains 
evolved earlier than had been supposed the piltdown man was supreme 
proof spencer says keith conservator of the hunterian museum of 
the royal college of surgeons who died in 1955 was one of the chief 
cheerleaders of the theory before piltdown was unearthed 
the discovery was debunked in 1953 when scientists learned the 
remains were a human skull only a couple of hundred years old with 
an orangutans jaw joined to it 
the general feeling was it was contrived to bring somebody 
down make someone in the scientific community look silly spencer 
said but if that was the case why didnt they do that 
instead the theory floated around the scientific community for 41 
years 
it makes far more sense when beginning to look at the evidence 
that piltdown was something made to withstand scientific scrutiny 
spencer says the piltdown bones were stained to make them look 
prehistoric and the orangutan teeth were filed down to make them 
look more like those of a meateating human a ruse keith had the 
knowledge and wherewithal to accomplish 
but the crux of the langhamspencer proof lies in keiths 
diaries in them spencer says keith indicates he had information 
about the site and events at piltdown information which he 
wouldnt have had unless he was an inside member of the group 
spencer said keith also had met with dawson a year before the 
discovery and again just several months before 
in reconstructing the langham thesis and other evidence i 
found i think weve come up with a substantial case spencer said 
others may disagree 
is this the end of the piltdown affair dr william ball a 
former keeper of paleontology at the british museum said when asked 
by the new york times to respond to spencers claims 
until such time as an unequivocal signed and detailed 
confession comes to light and one that can be shown to fit the 
facts as we now know them i rather doubt it

it was another stunning public relations 
triumph for mikhail s gorbachev abroad he won a trade deal some 
bank credits and new friends in business 
but gorbachevs weeklong visit to north america yielded no quick 
fix for the soviet economy and wont translate soon into tangible 
improvements in the lives of a frustrated and angry soviet people 
changing a system means changing people intelligent people 
gorbachev told business executives in minnesota its not just 
some kind of layout that you see on a piece of paper and you can 
just tear up that piece of paper a system is people people who 
live people who have their own interests who have their own 
lives 
he acknowldged also that people are afraid of change which he 
said is why the first five years of perestroika have had such 
limited results 
referring to his signing of a new trade pact with president bush 
in washington gorbachev said the agreement to establish normal 
trade ties is of great political importance 
but he said it will not have much practical effect right now 
for the period of transition to a market economy 
whats more bush made very clear during the summit last week 
that he will not send the trade agreement to congress for approval 
until the soviet union passes a new emigration law liberalizing 
restrictions on soviet citizens who wish to leave the country 
the supreme soviet legislature tuesday put off further 
consideration of the emigration bill at least until its next 
session which begins in september and even if gorbachev gets the 
issue back on the calendar us congressional leaders have said 
they intend to tie passage of the trade bill to settlement of the 
lithuanian crisis an even thornier dispute over the baltic 
republics declaration of independence from soviet rule 
during gorbachevs overnight stop in ottawa at the start of his 
trip across north america canada agreed to extend a 500 million 
line of credit to the soviet union over the next two years to help 
the soviets purchase canadian technology and consumer goods 
but last year when the soviets decided to spend substantial 
hardcurrency reserves to buy consumer goods abroad in order to show 
the soviet people some tangible benefits of reform the 
transportation system broke down and trainloads of such 
hardtofind items as toothpaste and laundry soap stacked up on the 
border because there was no place to unload them 
now in a classic demonstration of the failure of central 
planning the logjam has broken and a glut of imported detergent is 
stacked on otherwise empty store shelves 
gorbachev repeatedly mentioned during his trip the signing of an 
agreement with chevron corp to help explore and develop the vast 
tengiz oil field in a joint venture with the soviet government the 
field is believed to contain more than twice the petroleum reserves 
of alaskas great prudhoe bay 
but chevron officials having already learned the difficulties of 
doing business with the soviet union in a much smaller and less 
ambitious project say they expect long and complicated negotiations 
before any work begins 
and it will be years before the soviet economy or the american 
oil company begins to reap any reward 
a central theme of gorbachevs visit was that he wants to improve 
the climate in the soviet union for western business he not only 
encouraged captains of industry to invest their capital in his 
country and cited concessions his government has made to encourage 
them he warned that if they dont move now their reluctance will 
be remembered later 
youre wondering could involvement with the soviet union become 
a trap could you lose money as a result gorbachev said seeking 
to reassure them he said risk is good both in politics and 
business but adventurism is bad in both 
the current soviet leadership is in favor of profound changes 
but still it fully intends to do that in a careful way he said 
the soviet president reminded americans that market systems have 
been evolving in western countries for centuries and he is trying 
to put one in place practically overnight 
he could offer no guarantee that the troubled climate will clear 
anytime soon 
the reforms already introduced have so upset the old system he 
said our ship has lost anchor and therefore were all a little 
sick

dianne feinstein and john van de kamp brawled to the wire for one 
of 1990s biggest political prizes the democratic nomination for 
governor of california and voters set lineups tuesday for fall 
contests in eight other states 
the busiest primary night so far this campaign year saw north 
carolina democrats deciding whether former charlotte mayor harvey 
gantt or county prosecutor mike easley would get the formidable task 
of challenging republican sen jesse helms 
gantt was bidding to become the first black nominated for us 
senate in north carolina this century 
im ready to get into this fight with helms gantt said as he 
cast his own ballot im ready to get it on with him 
feinstein the former mayor of san francisco and van de kamp 
the state attorney general have spent millions of dollars battling 
each other and now the winner will plunge into an even more costly 
and just as nasty general election race against republican sen pete 
wilson he is trying to keep the california governors office in gop 
control 
voters also were choosing nominees in new jersey alabama iowa 
south dakota montana new mexico and mississippi 
as usual california voters also were making decisions on ballot 
propositions including two that would strip the legislature of most 
of its power to redraw legislative including congressional 
district lines california is likely to gain six us house seats as 
a result of the 1990 census 
another california ballot proposal would double the gasoline tax 
over the next five years and was being watched as a signal of a 
shift in sentiment in the state where the antitax revolt began in 
the 1970s 
seven senators and three governors were on ballots none with 
serious primary opposition 
the senators were democrats bill bradley of new jersey howell 
heflin of alabama max baucus of montana and tom harkin of iowa the 
republicans were larry pressler of south dakota pete domenici of 
new mexico and thad cochran of mississippi 
long in advance of their formal nomination in the primary harkin 
and republican rep tom tauke began campaigning against each other 
in what looks like one of the tightest senate races of the year 
alabama republican bill cabannis was geared to challenge heflin 
and democrat ted muenster was taking on pressler in south dakota 
in montana lt gov allen kolstad and businessman bruce vorhauer 
were the leading contenders for the republican nomination to 
challenge baucus 
scores of primaries also were deciding the lineups for elections 
to the house one incumbent who faced a strong challenge was 
democratic rep jim bates of san diego who was rebuked by the house 
ethics committee for sexual harassment of women employees 
one of the hottest primaries for a congressional seat was in the 
new jersey district represented by james courter the unsuccessful 
gop candidate for governor in 1989 courter is not seeking 
reelection to the house and the republican contenders to succeed 
him include assemblyman rodney frelinghuysen state sen richard a 
zimmer and professional football player phil mcconkey 
marguerite chandler was unopposed for the democratic nomination 
gov guy hunt of alabama the first republican elected to that 
office this century was bidding for a second term and a crowded 
field of democrats was vying to challenge him 
former gov fob james educatorlobbyist paul hubbert rep 
ronnie flippo and attorney general don siegelman were the leading 
contenders no one was expected to get the clear majority needed to 
avoid a june 26 runoff 
in a race in which abortion was a major issue iowa democrats 
were choosing among attorney general tom miller house speaker don 
avenson and banker john chrystal for the nomination to challenge 
republican gov terry branstad 
avenson and chrystal support the prochoice position while 
miller and branstad are abortion opponents 
republican gov garrey carruthers of new mexico was ineligible to 
seek reelection four democrats including former gov bruce king 
and four republicans were competing to succeed him the next 
governor will be the first allowed to serve two consecutive 
fouryear terms

south dakota gov george mickelson had no gop primary opposition 
as he seeks a second term in november he will face former 
democratic state sen bob samuelson 
contrary to political tradition president bush and other top gop 
officials have not hesitated this year to intervene in party 
primaries on behalf of candidates they believe would run strongest 
against democrats in the fall 
the white house helped persuade wilson who didnt need much 
persuading to enter the california governors race a year after he 
won a 13 million campaign for reelection to the senate 
control of the governors office in california is the highest 
priority for the leaders of both national parties 
after the 1980 census democrats had complete control of the 
redistricting process in the state and republicans claim it cost 
them at least five us house seats 
wilson already has 35 million in his campaign bank account and 
there is speculation the gop will spend close to 20 million in the 
race to succeed republican gov george deukmejian who decided 
against seeking a third term 
the white house recruited kolstad to take on baucus in montana 
but the effort backfired when three other republicans also entered 
the race 
the latest round of primaries saw no change in the issues mix 
that has marked other races this year nor was there any diminution 
in the negative tone of campaign commercials 
the roughest rhetoric was in the feinsteinvan de kamp race and 
it left some democrats concerned about prospects for uniting the 
party in time for the fall campaign 
the death penalty abortion and the environment were common 
themes 
in iowa the national abortion rights action league endorsed 
avenson out of concern that a democratic primary victory by miller 
would mean the choice in november would be between two abortion foes 
feinstein and van de kamp argued over which was more reliably 
prochoice 
van de kamp campaigned over the weekend with norma mccorvey who 
was the jane roe in the supreme courts landmark abortion 
decision mccorvey endorsed the california attorney general because 
i trust john van de kamp to defend the right i fought so hard to 
win 
feinstein countered that as a woman she would be the most 
reliable guardian of the prochoice position

an environmental adviser to president bush said 
tuesday that the nation has made remarkable progress in improving 
the environment over the past two decades but we have a long long 
way to go 
michael deland chairman of the presidents council on 
environmental quality said the next major strides in improving the 
environment will depend on industries voluntarily preventing 
pollution because doing so is in their economic interest 
the government should not walk away from ensuring that industry 
complies with environmental laws deland told reporters but he 
added that pollution prevention will not happen by federal or any 
other level of government fiat 
instead industries and businesses will find ways to reduce 
pollution because it will be economically beneficial to do so said 
deland a former regional administrator for the environmental 
protection agency 
deland made his remarks in releasing the council on environmental 
qualitys annual report which this year reviewed environmental 
progress made over the last 20 years 
the 494page report which the government sells for 17 provides 
a generally upbeat review of the countrys environmental record 
since 1970 the document suggested that while environmental problems 
persist remarkable improvements have been made in some areas 
such as overall air quality 
it noted however that progress in dealing with pollution in 
major cities and the protection of wetlands and coastal waters has 
come slowly 
the summary did not deal significantly with such concerns as 
global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer by manmade 
pollution which are relatively new areas of environmental concern 
deland whose appointment to the presidents council was hailed 
by environmentalists said a review of the last 20 years show the 
time has been largely a period of success 
he acknowledged however that there are major environmental 
problems yet to be addressed 
we are less energy efficient than are the west germans and the 
japanese we produce more waste both hazardous and solid than any 
other country we recycle at a deplorable rate less than 10 
percent the west germans close to 40 percent and the japanese 
approaching 50 he said 
we have without any question he continued a long long 
way to go and we recognize that

the judge in the mcmartin preschool 
molestation case on tuesday refused to dismiss any of the charges in 
defendant raymond buckeys retrial saying there was no double 
jeopardy 
superior court judge stanley weisberg acknowledged that some 
testimony may not have matched exactly the charges against him but 
he said the accounts by three young girls provided sufficient 
evidence to justify continuing the trial 
defense arguments concerning inconsistencies in testimony can be 
made to the jury when the case is submitted for decision the judge 
said 
under the constitution people cannot be subjected to double 
jeopardy being tried a second time on charges for which they wre 
found innocent but people can be tried a second time if there is a 
mistrial rather than an acquittal 
buckeys attorney danny davis argued that the counts on which 
buckey was being retried must be presented in the same way as they 
were in the first trial or it isnt really a retrial but a 
completely distinct and novel trial proceeding 
he sought dismissal of five of the eight counts by arguing the 
testimony didnt match the allegations detailed in the charges 
but the judge said i dont find there is a double jeopardy 
problem i find this is an erroneous analysis of double jeopardy 
in the case of one child who testified davis said the 
prosecution alleged she was molested while seated on buckeys lap 
during a horsey game on the stand the child said buckey was 
lying prone on the floor and she was on top of him she denied she 
was seated on his lap 
another child specifically denied being raped and sodomized with 
a foreign object davis noted although she alleged other acts of 
molestation the other acts are not specified in the charges 
the 32yearold buckey is being retried on eight molestation 
charges unresolved by the jury at his first trial the longest and 
costliest criminal case in us history 
the first buckey trial ended in january with buckey acquitted of 
40 counts of molestation and his mother acquitted of 12 charges but 
the jury deadlocked on 13 counts against buckey and the district 
attorney decided to retry him on eight of those charges involving 
three girls now 12 and 13 years old 
the girls have testified to assorted acts of molestation but 
pleaded poor memories on events that are alleged to have occurred 
when they were toddlers 
the mcmartin case has been in the courts for seven years 
initially seven defendants all staff at the nowdefunct school 
faced molestation charges buckey a former aide at the school is 
the remaining defendant 
the prosecution rested its case in the second trial friday after 
only three weeks of testimony from 12 witnesses the majority of 
them children and parents

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
said the agreement he signed tuesday with the government will leave 
the communist khmer rouge guerrillas fighting alone 
the accord which fell short of a hopedfor ceasefire in 
cambodias civil war ended a twoday tokyo peace conference 
the accord said a socalled supreme national council comprised 
of guerrilla and government representatives should be formed by the 
end of july the same month a timetable for a ceasefire should be 
established 
sihanouk called the talks a 50 percent success the powerful 
communist khmer rouge part of a threefaction rebel coalition 
headed by sihanouk boycotted the sessions 
the group declined to join the conference unless it was an equal 
member in the twosided talks rather than a part of sihanouks 
resistance coalition japanese officials said the khmer rouge also 
refused to sign any accord that linked a ceasefire with the 
proposed governing body 
the khmer rouge was ready to accept a ceasefire or statements 
about the desirability of a supreme national council but not a 
linkage between them particularly a time linkage a foreign 
ministry official said on condition of anonymity 
a second foreign ministry official said khmer rouge nominal 
leader khieu samphan had a rather limited mandate for the talks 
anything beyond that mandate he had great trouble accepting 
the conference was heralded as a steppingstone to a cambodia 
peace conference set for paris in july 
the final documents arrived late for the signing ceremony tuesday 
evening drawing an apology from masaharu kohno a southeast asia 
division chief in the foreign ministry 
sihanouk signed the communique with hun sen premier of the phnom 
penh government and japanese foreign minister taro nakayama acted 
as chairman the two cambodians embraced then drank a champagne 
toast to peace in cambodia 
at a news conference sihanouk said fighting would continue in 
cambodia but not involving the guerrilla force headed by his son 
prince ranariddh or that of his conservative partner former 
premier son sann 
from now on the ranariddhists and the son sannists will stop 
fighting he said i can predict that there will be continuation 
of war in my country between the khmer rouge on one side and the 
viets and hun sennians on the other 
but a thai official speaking on condition of anonymity said it 
was one thing for sihanouk to say his forces should stop and another 
thing for the commanders in the field to heed the call 
western observers in bangkok have long noted a division between 
cambodian political figures like sihanouk who spend little time in 
the field and live comfortably elsewhere and their followers who 
have a steady flow of munitions to use as they see fit 
fighting was reported to be increasing in cambodia before the 
tokyo conference started 
if sihanouks prediction is borne out the chinesebacked khmer 
rouge would be isolated on the battlefield as well as in 
international opinion many have rejected the idea of the khmer 
rouge participating in any future government 
during the khmer rouges 197579 rule hundreds of thousands of 
people were killed or died of starvation the group was ousted by 
the vietnamese 
the khmer rouge is militarily the strongest guerrilla faction 
fighting the phnom penh government installed by hanoi 
the 67yearold sihanouk has headed the resistance since 1982 he 
says the khmer rouge killed five of his children but still believes 
the groups force is the strongest barrier to vietnamese 
encroachment on cambodia 
the sihanoukhun sen communique calls for all factions to use 
voluntary selfrestraint on force to refrain from offensive 
actions and to impose a military standstill 
the khmer rouge said in a statement it was ready to attend the 
paris conference

sen richard lugar ranking republican on the 
senate agriculture committee said tuesday he would not compromise 
with the democrats to raise target prices and loan rates in the 1990 
farm bill 
he also said he was not willing to take more acreage out of 
production or accept shifts in finances to create the illusion of 
deficit reduction without real cuts 
ive been infinitely flexible in other things in the bill 
he said but he said these four areas were not negotiable and would 
lead to a floor fight if the democratic majority on the committee 
insists in keeping them in the bill 
the democrats have to decide do we want an issue or do we 
want a bill said lugar if an issue is what they want then my 
guess is we will have a oneyear extension 
congress passes a farm bill every five years to set agriculture 
policy including the degree to which the federal government will 
subsidize farmers through target prices and loan rates 
current law expires in december but the bush administration has 
said repeatedly that it would accept a oneyear extension of 
existing policies 
that is viewed by many in congress as a strategy that would help 
us negotiators at international trade talks at which the united 
states is trying to get other countries to remove subsidies from 
agricultural products that distort world market prices 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who is actively involved 
in those talks has said that us subsidies may have to be adjusted 
to comply with whatever agreement develops 
lugar mentioned the trade talks in a session with reporters but 
said his main objection to the democrats proposal for increasing 
target prices is budgetary 
at a time when it is fairly likely people may be asked to pay 
more taxes for the farm program to be asking for more money is not 
prudent he said 
lugar said however he did not know for sure if a tax increase 
was going to be proposed by president bush or congressional leaders 
who are discussing solutions to the governments spending problems 
lugars comments preceded a meeting of a senate agriculture 
committee task force that is trying to compromise the republican and 
democratic proposals on price supports 
the democrats want to increase target prices 1 percent with other 
increases possible in the last four years of the program depending 
on inflation 
the house agriculture committee meanwhile has voted to freeze 
target prices

state lawmakers lined up what they hope 
will be highpowered testimony as they begin their to effort write a 
law that will reach the us supreme court and result in strict 
national limits on abortion 
awardwinning geneticist jerome lejeune of the faculty of 
medicine of paris is being flown to baton rouge for hearings that 
start wednesday he will testify that life begins at conception 
his testimony in a tennessee case was instrumental in a ruling 
last year that seven frozen embryos were human beings with 
constitutional rights an appeals court is still considering that 
ruling 
lejeune achieved international recognition for his discovery of 
the genetic roots of downs syndrome 
also scheduled to testify the daughter of a rape victim and a 
former abortion clinic operator who has recanted said rep 
woody jenkins 
abortionrights advocates promised a lowkey campaign 
we will have more homegrown folks to testify because we dont 
want this to be another vietnam where you bring in outside resources 
to fight in our land on this issue said robin rothrock director 
of an abortionrights coalition and president of the state league of 
women voters 
the fight shifted to louisiana after the governor of idaho vetoed 
a restrictive abortion bill that had been written to go to the 
supreme court 
antiabortion forces hope the court will overturn its 1973 roe 
vs wade decision that allowed for abortion 
those hopes were roused last year when the court ruled in a 
missouri case that states have some leeway in restricting abortion 
although most of the focus in louisiana was on the scheduled 
eight hours of testimony in the house criminal justice committee a 
separate antiabortion bill was moving through the senate with less 
fanfare 
a senate committee approved a bill on monday that would ban 
abortions except to save the mothers life violators would face 
maximum 10year prison sentences 
thats like my bill and its good to have two vehicles 
jenkins said but we need extensive hearings on the legal medical 
and social questions to use in the record for our challenge of roe 
vs wade thats what makes the house hearings so important 
rothrock said the hearings are designed to stir emotions rather 
than shed light 
a large part of what is going on at this point is a circus 
atmosphere said rothrock 
the issue is whether these bills amount to a legitimate 
challenge to roe vs wade with no exceptions and with a criminal 
penalty they are blatantly unconstitutional and are not legitimate 
we would be wasting up to 3 million in appeals battles at a time 
when this state has a 600 million shortfall 
but with the legislature it may be impossible to overcome the 
emotionalism that means we have a circus and louisiana will be made 
a spectacle 
a majority of the house criminal justice committee said it wanted 
an amendment making exceptions for rape incest and to protect the 
health and life of the mother 
gov buddy roemer an abortion foe said he will veto any bill 
without those exceptions

while south koreas political and trade relations 
with moscow develop japans ties to the soviet union are tied up in 
a longstanding dispute over tokyos demand for the return of islands 
seized by the soviets in world war ii 
the dispute has prevented the nations from signing a peace treaty 
since the war ended in 1945 and it was brought up during the 
superpower summit in washington 
president bush told prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan that he 
raised the issue with mikhail s gorbachev during their talks 
government spokesman misoji sakamoto said 
but sakamoto said gorbachev did not show a forthcoming attitude 
on the kuril islands which lie off the northern tip of japan 
meanwhile gorbachev ended his us trip monday by meeting in san 
francisco with president roh taewoo of south korea south korean 
officials predicted the unprecedented meeting would lead to 
diplomatic ties between seoul and moscow which were on opposite 
sides in the cold war 
the soviets are allies with communist north korea south koreas 
archenemy and they supported the north during the korean war 
but economic and political relations have warmed in recent years 
particularly since 1988 when the soviets participated in the seoul 
olympics despite a boycott by north korea 
many in seoul see improved ties with moscow as a means of easing 
tensions with the north 
japan on tuesday also welcomed the rohgorbachev meeting as a way 
of contributing to stability on the korean peninsula 
the summit between the two countries is quite important we 
welcome the meeting itself said acting foreign ministry spokesman 
makoto yamanaka we hope both countries would further relations so 
that a relaxation of tension could be obtained on the korean 
peninsula 
if south korea could have stable relations with china and the 
soviet union that would contribute to the stabilization of the 
situation on the korean peninsula yamanaka said 
but he said the north korean reaction to the talks would be an 
important factor in determining the effect of sovietsouth korean 
rapprochement on stability on the peninsula which was divided into 
the communist north and capitalist south in 1945 
the japanese government has been trying to engage in a dialogue 
with north korea but so far hasnt received any favorable response 
at all he added 
on the question of the kuril islands yamanaka said we havent 
sensed any sign of flexibility from the soviet side he added 
maybe its too early 
the soviet side has sought increased trade with japan but its 
efforts have been handicapped by the territorial dispute coupled 
with wariness among japanese businessmen toward what they view as 
risky often unprofitable investments 
soviet officials have suggested their overture to south korea was 
intended to worry japanese businessmen who still view the soviet 
union as a potentially vast market for japanese goods 
japanese officials earlier scoffed at such ideas saying they 
were not desperate enough for investment opportunities to compromise 
their stand on the territorial issue 
despite the diplomatic standoff gorbachev said sunday that he 
planned to visit japan sometime next year to discuss increasing 
economic ties

marilyn quayle said tuesday that at times 
during the 1988 campaign the media made her feel very angry and 
terribly vulnerable 
however mrs quayle said she had learned much since dan quayle 
was george bushs vice presidential running mate 
lets meet halfway she told an audience of reporters at the 
national press club i only ask for fairness and accuracy 
mrs quayle said the campaign was a baptism by fire for all the 
quayles 
before it was all over i felt a least a little singed she 
said it hurt reading stories or seeing reports about a man 
bearing almost no resemblance to the one i love deeply 
at times i felt misunderstood misrepresented very angry and 
terribly vulnerable she said 
during the campaign mrs quayle bristled but spoke little except 
to defend her husband against what she said were unfair attacks 
including questions about his decision to join the national guard 
during the vietnam war and his academic performance 
i put on my armor to do battle for my family and in the 
process i froze some of you out she said i regret that chalk 
it up to inexperience or to protectiveness 
asked why she decided to talk about the campaign she said i 
was hoping that this talk would put it all to rest 
every interview i give every place i go i get the same

israeli soldiers shot and killed an 8yearold 
arab boy tuesday during a confrontation in a west bank refugee camp 
and a 14yearold palestinian in the nearby city of nablus local 
reports said 
troops clamped curfews on nablus and the askar refugee camp after 
the shootings 
the army confirmed a boy from the askar camp was killed when 
troops fired rubber bullets at palestinian stonethrowers but said 
the boy was 10 not eight 
the army spokesmans office said the military commander in 
nablus the west banks largest town was investigating the 
circumstances 
the victim ahmad salama died at al ittihad hospital in nablus 
after being struck by a rubber bullet that penetrated his skull 
hospital officials said 
the fatality quickly triggered more unrest in askar as several 
hundred angry palestinians gathered for the boys funeral and some 
unfurled the outlawed palestinian flag 
soldiers clamped a curfew on the camp of 9000 to contain the 
disturbances the army said 
salama was the second 8yearold killed in clashes the past month 
according to the israeli human rights group betselem 43 
palestinian children ages 12 and younger have been killed from the 
december 1987 start of the uprising through may 31 it said 110 
other youths ages 13 to 16 have also been killed by israelis 
the army claims small children frequently are placed at the front 
of arab protests while palestinians accuse the army of firing 
without caution and sometimes hitting children who are not 
demonstrators 
in nablus a 14yearold youth was killed tuesday when troops 
encountered a group of masked arab activists carrying axes 
arab journalists said the youths were carrying a loudspeaker and 
calling for protests to mark the 23rd anniversary of the start of 
the 1967 middle east war in which israel captured the west bank from 
jordan and the gaza strip from egypt 
army officials said soldiers ordered the arabs to stop fired in 
the air and at then at their legs before shooting directly at the 
group and killing one of the activists 
arab hospital officials identified the youth as 14yearold rami 
farid kamhieh and said another youth was wounded in the shooting 
the violent outbreak came as palestinians held a general strike 
throughout the occupied lands to mark the anniversary of israels 
capture of the terrritories 
tuesdays deaths raised to 716 the number of palestinians killed 
during the nearly 30monthold rebellion against israeli rule in the 
occupied territories 
at least 218 palestinians have also been slain by fellow arabs as 
alleged collaborators with israel fortyfive israelis have been 
killed in the unrest 
in israel meanwhile a magistrates court judge ordered an 
israeli suspected of massacring seven gazan workers near tel aviv 
last month held an additional 14 days while an investigation 
continues 
the shooting suspect ami popper 21 of rishon lezion near tel 
aviv had been dishonorably discharged from the army he was turned 
in by friends shortly after the attack and is undergoing psychiatric 
tests by court order 
poppers attorney david ofek contends his client is not 
psychologically fit to stand trial

members of congress sometimes earn speaking 
fees at fancy resorts but a survey of privately financed senate 
trips found tuesday that the top destination in 1989 was new york 
city 
all told senators took at least 506 trips last year paid for 
with privat funds primarily to speak before corporate and trade 
groups public citizens congress watch said tuesday 
there were 44 trips to new york 28 to los angeles 28 to 
chicago 19 to west palm beach fla and 15 to miami according to 
the survey of financial disclosure records released last week 
other cities frequented often were st louis dallas orlando and 
san francisco there were nine trips each to jamaica and switzerland

travel last year with 20 trips he was followed by sens orrin g 
hatch rutah and james jeffords rvt with 14 trips each 
sen kent conrad dnd had 13 trips the same as sen charles 
robb dva tied with 12 trips were sens joseph biden ddel john 
breaux dla charles grassley riowa don nickles rokla and 
alan simpson rwyo 
public citizen found that the groups financing the trips often 
invited senators from committees that regulated their industries 
for instance durenbergers 20 trips included 10 with 
healthrelated interests the minnesota republican sits on 
subcommittees of the senate finance committee that deal with health 
issues 
the group suggested that congressional travel be financed by the 
taxpayers and that free trips from private sources be banned 
members of congress should be subject to the same travel rules 
as cabinet secretaries if a speech is worth making to advance the 
public interest and some of them certainly are the government 
should pay said public citizen president joan claybrook 
records for a halfdozen senators could not be checked because 
they were granted filing extensions

defense witnesses at the mayors drug and perjury trial

a jury will be seated to hear the case against the mayor 
the nine include an fbi clerk two lawyers a government worker 
a journalist two retirees and a 70yearold woman who said she 
thinks politicians are dishonest 
one woman an art teacher at a private school initially said she 
had formed an opinion about the case after barrys january arrest on 
drug charges at a washington hotel an incident which forms the 
basis of one of the charges 
but after prolonged questioning she said she could presume 
barrys innocence and listen impartially to the evidence if she sat 
as a juror 
barrys lawyer r kenneth mundy said the woman shouldnt be 
sent into the jury pool but the judge rejected mundys request 
barry joked with reporters as he arrived on a brilliant spring 
day asking one whether he wanted to play tennis once inside the 
courtroom he chatted with artists asking them how long it takes to 
draw their sketches for television 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocaine 
possession three counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of 
conspiracy the three perjury charges are felonies 
mundy said in court that he wanted the name of anita bonds 
barrys campaign manager added to the list of possible witnesses 
bonds sat next to barry at the defense table during much of the 
days proceedings 
law enforcement and city government sources have said prosecutors 
were on the verge of questioning bonds when a grand jury indicted 
the mayor on may 10 bonds has said she had not received a subpoena 
to testify but was informed by police officials working on the case 
that prosecutors wished to speak with her 
also added to the list is david rivers the former director of 
the citys department of human services and a close friend of barry 
rivers is currently on trial in the same courthouse accused of 
steering city contracts to friends and business associates 
drama was slight in tuesdays questioning of possible jurors 
under questioning from assistant us attorney richard roberts a 
man who works as a chauffeur said his only arrest had been for a 
traffic violation 
roberts then confronted the man with a document showing he had 
been arrested and accused of breaking into a mens clothing store 
the chauffeur said the matter had been thrown out and said he 
had forgotten about the incident 
i never went to court he added 
others questioned included a lawyer whose firm represents one of 
the government witnesses in the case the lawyer said she knows 
nothing about the firms representation of the anticipated witness 
james mcwilliams a longtime friend of the mayor

if you want to spend the day at sandy 
neck dunes youll soon have to pack a portable toilet with your 
picnic basket and towel 
a regulation adopted last month requires sunbathers to bring a 
portable toilet as things are now you kind of have to watch where 
you step said brenda bell chairman of the governing board for 
the cape cod beach 
you go to the dunes when theres no rain and you can smell 
human waste on hot sunny days in summertime ms bell said 
board member ellen mcbarron said the plan was passed as an 
environmental measure she said placing portable toilets on the 
sixmile sandspit was not a viable alternative because high tides 
would sweep them out into cape cod bay 
ms bell said 600 vehicles are on the beach each day plus people 
who come to the beach from cottages 
youre talking about a lot of vehicles packed with an average 
of five people where are they going to go to the bathroom ms 
bell said 
there is some relief for beachgoers however 
the new rule wont go into effect until next year because 800 
beach passes have already been sold

a federal district judge is considering whether 
to dismiss a 38 million libel suit filed against two journalists by 
irancontra figure richard v secord 
lawyer dean ringel told judge george h revercombe on tuesday 
that secords suit against leslie and andrew cockburn and the 
atlantic monthly press should be dismissed because no actual malice 
has been proved 
but w michael kramer attorney for the former air force major 
general contended the authors in a 1988 book falsely linked 
secord to narcotics trafficking as part of the effort to finance the 
contra rebels 
kramer asked the judge for additional time to take depositions 
and search for further evidence in the case 
revercombe took both motions under advisement 
kramer contended that the clear intent of the book out of 
control the story of the reagan administrations secret war in 
nicaragua was to exploit the irancontra affair by putting the 
administration and its key players in the worst possible light 
but ringel appealing for dismissal said mr secord seems to 
assume that since the book takes a political position opposite to 
that of the previous administration that is evidence of malice 
one of the consequences of letting this go on is the concern 
that this could go on endlessly he said every nook and cranny 
of the irancontra affair becomes open for discussion theres no 
need for that 
kramer said secords attorneys have no intention of doing that 
and want only a limited period of focused discovery 
secords libel suit was filed in march 1988 the same day he was 
indicted for his irancontra role 
he was sentenced to two years probation on one of 12 original 
counts after a plea bargain but he is appealing alleging that 
independent counsel lawrence walsh lacked jurisdiction to prosecute 
for an offense arising out of secords congressional irancontra 
testimony

the us market for ivory has virtually 
collapsed since president bush banned imports a year ago to help 
protect the african elephant and sales have dropped in some other 
countries the world wildlife fund said tuesday 
but the group was worried that ivory carvers may turn to using 
hippopotamus teeth and suggested instead that they ply their art on 
the tusks of extinct mammoths being dug from the frozen tundra of 
siberia 
bush announced a moratorium on ivory imports june 5 1989 and 
japan the worlds biggest market for ivory has also been enforcing 
a ban 
dealers report that wholesale prices for jewelry and simple 
carvings which historically accounted for most of the us market 
have been discounted by 40 to 70 percent the wildlife funds 
report said 
one major ivory trader on new york stated firmly that price is 
irrelevant in the current us market since demand does not 
exist the report said 
results in other areas are mixed but the report saw encouragement 
for the funds efforts it estimated that africas elephant 
population went down from 1194331 in 1981 to about 610000 last 
year 
one substitute for elephant ivory the tusks of prehistoric 
mammoths dug up by the soviet union 
we dont try to protect the mammoth its been extinct for 
10000 years said michael sutton one of the authors of the 
report 
he said he was more concerned about carvers who are shifting to 
hippopotamus teeth a lot of hippos have to be killed to get the 
same weight in teeth as comes from the tusks of one elephant 
in 1989 japan imported about 1991 kilograms 4380 pounds of 
mammoth ivory and 1235 kilograms 2717 pounds of hippo teeth 
the report said 
the declared value of hippo teeth is about 60 per kilogram 
22 pounds mammoth ivory is valued at 180 to 240 per kilogram 
according to japanese customs data 
one price that has been going up plectra for the samisen 
according to the report the strings of this japanese instrument are 
played with a pick that must be carved from a raw tusk weighing at 
least 57 pounds that size is rare these days as poachers turn to 
younger and younger elephants 
in hong kong the report said the number of ivory shops has 
declined and up to 75 percent of the carvers have found other jobs 
the government has promised them a subsidized course in carving ox 
bones 
china refused to go along with an internationally agreed ban but 
the report said the ivory trade there has nearly collapsed and the 
number of carvers has gone down it quoted us government sources 
as saying that the chinese government may ban ivory imports from 
africa 
but south korea imported 288 tons of carved ivory in 1989 more 
than in the previous five years combined the report suggests 
traders may have established the country as a new carving center or 
a base for smuggling 
illegal slaughter of elephants was reported to have declined 
considerably in kenya the central african republic and gabon 
though not in malawi or tanzania 
the poacher is at the low end of chain said sutton it 
takes a while for the effect of lower prices to trickle down to 
him 
the report pointed out that africans in the elephant areas are so 
poor that even 1 to 5 a kilogram may be an attractive price

outgoing colombian president virgilio barco on 
tuesday promised that his successor will continue the fight against 
narcotics trafficking and asked us backing for his efforts 
barco who leaves office aug 7 met with bush in the oval office 
for 40 minutes and told reporters later that his drugplagued nation 
will continue its efforts to stop the flow of cocaine northward 
we will continue that because we believe in that and the next 
president of colombia the presidentelect also has been 
stating that he would continue to fight drugs and im sure that he 
will receive the backing of the united states he said 
barco who has met with bush several times on the issue of 
illegal narcotics was prohibited by the countrys constitution from 
seeking reelection he came to the united states to give the 
commencement address at massachusetts institute of technology on 
monday 
barcos successor cesar gaviria was the only candidate in last 
months election to take a hardline stand against drug traffickers 
who use colombia as a major processing and transport center gaviria 
has complained that colombians are dying in the drug wars while 
other nations do little 
in his victory speech gaviria called on developed countries to 
cut cocaine consumption and to work harder to control arms 
trafficking and moneylaundering by cocaine traffickers 
he also said the united states to drop trade impediments against 
colombian exports and to increase aid to his country 
barco in his meeting with bush also raised trade questions 
said white house spokesman bill harlow 
gaviria has said exports likes coffee and flowers should receive 
preferential treatment but harlow said barco did not directly raise 
the coffee or flower issue 
after the meeting barco brushed aside questions on flowers and 
coffee agreements indicating those were matters yet to be resolved 
he said little about the meeting except that it was pleasant and 
that they talked about the cooperation that colombia needs 
however the colombian embassy had released a statement urging 
the united states to take the lead in restoring an international 
coffee cartel whose collapse last year without us support has led 
to a drop in coffee prices cost the colombian government more than 
500 million in 1989 according to the colombians 
the 74nation international coffee agreement abandoned production 
quotas for member nations in july when the united states withdrew 
the united states had complained that some coffeegrowing nations 
taking part in the agreement sold coffee surpluses secretly to east 
bloc nations at lower prices than those charged in the united states 
us officials also wanted an increase in export quotas for 
higherquality coffees sought by american consumers a position 
favored by many central american countries growing those grades who 
were unhappy with what they saw as overly restrictive production 
quotas 
rep charles rangel chairman of the select committee on 
narcotics abuse said in a statement bush must do more to address 
colombias requests on such matters as the coffee agreement and 
banning us exports of weapons popular with drug lords 
if we want to see this battle continue we will have to give 
more than moral support for courage rangel said we will have 
to address the specific requests of the elected colombian leaders 
harlow said bush briefed barco on his recent summit meeting with 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev

the senate refused to limit debate tuesday on 
wideranging anticrime legislation containing curbs on semiautomatic 
weapons sponsors warned that the threat of a filibuster could doom 
the measure 
senate judiciary chairman joseph r biden jr ddel futilely 
urged the chamber to limit debate to 30 hours saying americans 
want something done about these godawful assault weapons 
the bills backers said they would make a second attempt at 
curtailing debate later in the week 
biden said the national rifle association was behind tuesdays 
vote and said that if the time limit fails on the second try 
opening the door to a filibuster it will be the end of the 
official crime bill 
both he and senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said 
they thought they could find enough votes to cap the debate at 30 
hours 
on the roll call 54 senators voted in favor of limiting debate 
while 37 senators opposed such a curb sponsors needed 60 votes to 
impose the time limit 
fortyfour democrats and 10 republicans voted for imposing 
cloture on the debate while 31 republicans and six democrats wee 
opposed 
mitchell said however that republican leader bob dole of kansas 
was among those calling for a second vote on the measure whose 
death penalty as well as guncontrol provisions are likely to figure 
in some fall reelection campaigns 
the bill would bar imports and domestic manufacture of nine 
semiautomatic rifles and pistols 
other provisions would impose the death penalty for 30 federal 
crimes overhaul the appeals system and sanction the use of evidence 
gathered with faulty warrants if the police acted in good faith 
sponsors said they needed to limit debate if they were to have 
any hope of passage as of noon more than 230 proposed amendments 
were in the hopper with the promise of more to come they ranged 
from mandatory life sentences for rapists with aids to commemorative 
medals for the yosemite national park centennial 
the bills supporters said debating each of them would guarantee 
critics the power to stall of any final vote 
if cloture is invoked the crime bill will pass if cloture is 
not invoked the crime bill will die biden said but he added that 
there could be a second attempt to choke off debate within a few 
days 
no senators stood up to speak against limiting debate although 
in fiery floor exchanges two weeks ago western lawmakers declared 
that many of their constituents were hunters and gun collectors and 
considered any restriction on ownership to be a violation of their 
rights 
sen alan simpson rwyo recalled how his grandmother used to 
pack a little iron in the frontier era 
efforts to curb militarystyle semiautomatic weapons sometimes 
called assault weapons got under way in earnest in january 1989 
after a deranged man with such a rifle sprayed a stockton calif 
schoolyard leaving five people dead and 30 others wounded 
the bush administration has been pressing for the death penalty 
provisions as part of the presidents crime package it also sought 
a far more stringent overhaul of the habeas corpus review process 
under which defendants can appeal their convictions on 
constitutional grounds

president bush signed the trade agreement with 
mikhail s gorbachev believing the soviet leader wants to resolve 
tensions with lithuania but without receiving concrete assurances 
the white house said tuesday 
bush summoned congressional leaders to the white house for a 
postsummit briefing and told them that before putting his name on 
the agreement he repeatedly expressed concern to gorbachev about 
the economic blockade against lithuania 
i accept that said senate democratic leader george mitchell 
dmaine 
the lawmakers did not fault bush for approving the trade pact 
nevertheless they emphasized that gorbachev will have to ease up on 
the baltic republic before congress approves any of the benefits 
described by the agreement 
the agreement is not an ordinary treaty which must be ratified 
by a twothrids vote of the senate under special trade legislation 
applying to communist countries the agreement must be approved by a 
majority vote in both the house and the senate 
call it linkage or call it reality said senate republican 
leader bob dole rkan 
there will have to be some moderation of soviet policy with 
respect to lithuania before the agreement is approved and 
mostfavorednation status granted said mitchell the 
mostfavored status would give moscow the lowestpossible tariffs on 
its exports to america 
bush has acknowledged that the fate of lithuania will be a big 
factor in the decision of congress whether to ratify the trade 
agreement 
however the only price he has set for sending the agreement to 
capitol hill is the passage of a law by the soviet legislature 
protecting emigration such an emigration law and a trade 
agreement must be in operation before the president may grant 
mostfavorednation trade status 
bush has said he intends to grant that status once the emigration 
legislation passes 
moscow announced tuesday a tentative postponement of any action 
on emigration until september and the white house seemed to breathe 
a sigh of relief 
that may not be bad in the sense of it gives them a little 
time to work on the emigration issue and take action on 
lithuania said bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater 
it might well be that by the time the emigration law was passed 
and we were ready to go forward with this trade agreement that 
there would be action on lithuania fitzwater said 
the signing of the trade agreement was the biggest surprise of 
the fourday superpower summit and fitzwater said bushs decision 
to sign came only a half hour before the two leaders put their names 
on the document 
the spokesman said bush and gorbachev had long discussions about 
lithuania on at least three occasions during the summit and there 
were no private assurances or conditions 
he said there was a general kind of assurance by gorbachev 
but there was no specific illdothis kind of thing 
still fitzwater said we have the feeling that he wants to 
resolve the issue the president believes his gorbachevs 
motives are that he wants to resolve the issue were persuaded 
that he wants to resolve the issue 
fitzwater said bushs decision was the result of the 
accumulation of conversation over the two days about understanding 
that they knew our position and knew our concern a feeling that he 
was interested in solving this problem a belief that there were 
commitments to deal with this 
the agreement was an important trophy for gorbachev seeking 
improved trade relations with the west to help cope with a deepening 
economic crisis at home 
bush and other administration leaders had hinted that the 
agreement would not be signed until gorbachev ended his economic 
stranglehold on lithuania which is struggling for independence from 
the kremlin 
however after impassioned pleas by gorbachev to bush and also 
to congressional leaders the president decided to go ahead 
house republican leader robert michel of illinois said gorbachev 
made a remarkable presentation to the lawmakers 
here was the first time a soviet leader was telling us ive 
got real problems at home and wed like to establish a market 
economy which ought to give us all a measure of hope michel 
said 
gorbachev flying back to the soviet union sent a farewell 
message to bush as his jetliner cleared us airspace at 139 am 
edt tuesday it was received at the white house situation room the 
24hour communications and crisis center in the basement of the 
white house 
having completed my stay in your great country once again i 
wish to express my deep satisfaction with the results of my visit 
gorbachev said the work we have done together during these days 
will bear good fruit i would like to express to you and to all 
americans my sincere gratitude for the respect shown to the soviet 
people and for your hospitality and warm reception 
in addition to earlierannounced postsummit telephone calls to 
british prime minister margaret thatcher and german prime minister 
helmut kohl the white house said bush had phoned japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu and french president francois mitterrand

free cigarettes no more 
the city council voted 33to0 tuesday to ban tobacco companies 
from giving out free cigarettes to potential customers or smokers 
the main target according to the bills sponsor councilman sal 
albanese was to stop young people age 18 or younger from being 
tempted to smoke 
albanese said cigarettes are distributed free on street corners 
and other places and that youngsters can get them 
in ending this reprehensible practice he said new york 
city will not only become the largest jurisdiction in the nation to 
ban the free distribution of tobacco products to the public but as 
large as the next six jurisdictions combined 
albanese said at least 15 other cities including boston 
atlanta austin texas and cincinnati also bar the free 
distribution of cigarettes 
chairman of the councils committee on youth services albanese 
said the legislation would bar individuals and businesses from 
distributing tobacco products in public places or at public events 
for free or at any price less than the combined cost of the required 
taxes 
the state tax on cigarettes is 39 cents 
the bill still needs the approval of mayor david dinkins

new jersey is failing miserably at educating 
poor urban students the state supreme court ruled tuesday in a 
decision that declared unconstitutional the way aid is distributed 
to public schools 
the high court ruled in effect that determining school funding 
based on property tax revenues is unfair 
the evidence compels but one conclusion the poorer the 
district and the greater its need the less the money available and 
the worse the education chief justice robert n wilentz wrote 
these students simply cannot possibly enter the same market or 
the same society as their peers educated in wealthier districts 
the justices in the unanimous decision ordered lawmakers to begin 
reforms by the 199192 school year 
the state must assure poor urban districts spend about the same 
amount of money per child as richer suburban districts the court 
ruled 
the court estimated that the state needs to add 440 million to 
its 35 billion public schools budget to remedy disparities in the 
states 28 poorest districts 
todays ruling is a clear victory for the children of new 
jersey said gov jim florio who last week unveiled a plan to 
raise the state income tax the tax hike would raise 1 billion for 
more aid to middleincome and poor districts while aid to wealthier 
school systems would be reduced or eliminated 
the court has recognized that the current school funding system 
is leading us to be two new jerseys where some youngsters head for 
the best colleges and others go down a road to nowhere florio 
said predicting his reform proposal will satisfy the court 
new jersey is among more than a dozen states where courts have 
overturned school finance systems in recent years 
i think there absolutely is a trend evident in the last two 
years we have seen four state supreme courts strike down their 
school finance systems montana kentucky texas and now new 
jersey said arthur wise director of the washingtonbased rand 
center for the study of the teaching profession 
other states involved in funding disputes include kansas 
wisconsin california connecticut washington west virginia 
wyoming and arkansas 
since 1980 the gap between rich districts and poor districts 
has been increasing thats why we have this trend the poor are 
more hardpressed than they were during the 1970s wise said 
a new school funding system will take effect in montana on july 
1 passed by lawmakers after the states highest court declared the 
former system unconstitutional 
in october the texas supreme court declared its system 
unconstitutional the state senate on tuesday approved and sent to 
the house a 528 million education reform bill 
a funding bill that would hike sales taxes by a quartercent and 
increase taxes on mixed drinks and tobbacco products was passed by 
both the texas house and senate on tuesday 
the kentucky supreme court delivered a similar ruling last year 
forcing lawmakers to raise taxes to pay for 500 million more in 
education aid 
the new jersey decision does not place a cap on spending and rich 
districts can continue to increase spending if they choose but the 
state must increase aid to poorer districts if subpar education 
standards continue the court said 
lawmakers may devise any remedy they wish to correct the 
disparities but they may not force poor districts to raise property 
taxes the court ruled 
the court also ruled unconstitutional the politically popular 
minimum aid program that gives money to affluent districts 
regardless of need 
the rulings stem from a 1981 lawsuit filed by the newarkbased 
education law center which brought the court action on behalf of 20 
schoolage children from camden jersey city east orange and 
irvington 
the ruling culminated a decadelong battle during which former 
gov thomas h kean fought the lawsuit and defended the funding 
system 
in 1984 the court said school districts spent an average of 
4030 per pupil while the poorest school systems spent only about 
2860 per pupil statewide an average of 3329 per pupil was 
spent

an alldigital allamerican highdefinition 
television system developed by a us company has made a lastminute 
entry in the race to become the us national tv broadcast standard 
officials said tuesday 
we are leapfrogging stateofthe art technology said mike 
walker a spokesman for the videocipher division of general 
instruments corp showcasing the new digicipher technology in 
san diego 
highdefinition tv or hdtv provides vastly sharper tv pictures 
and compact discquality sound however its signal requires a wider 
broadcast channel about 30 megahertz rather than conventional 
tvs 6 megahertz 
the federal communications commission set a june 1 deadline for 
proposals on a simulcast system that works on todays tv sets 
and fits onto the existing broadcast spectrum on june 1 general 
instruments filed its proposal 
the technologies that weve developed are proprietary 
technologies that digitize and compress the video signal walker 
said we reduce the amount or data that is transmitted but 
maintain or enhance the quality of the picture 
conventional tvs would receive the standard signal while the 
second signal would be broadcast and received on hdtv equipment 
whose manufacturers pay lucrative royalties to the owners of the 
technology 
other proposals before the fcc are from nhk the japanese 
broadcasting system zenith electronics corp an international 
consortium of nbc with dutch and french electronics companies and 
massachusetts institute of technology 
the systems would be tested for 12 to 18 months before the 
government chooses the standard sometime in 1993 
walker said the technology grew out of videocipher research for 
its core market satellite and cable systems into a digital 
compression system that would let multiple tv signals move through a 
single satellite relay 
it is a seamless technology walker said the same system of 
coding compression and decoding can be used by satellite and cable 
systems as well as terrestrial tv broadcasting 
the videocipher division of general instruments which is 263rd 
on the fortune 500 specializes in satellite encryption systems 
plans to have its hdtv prototype system before the fcc in february 
1991 
walker said the digital system will have the advantages of error 
correction circuitry already familiar to compact disc owners 
electronic noise snow interference and ghost images would 
canceled out 
you can send that signal through noise take it out of 
correction and wind up with a perfect signal an exact duplicate of 
what was transmitted he said 
the digital compression technology will increase the number of 
signals handled by a single satellite relay or transponder walker 
said 
we could send two highdefinition signals on one transponder 
or we could send up to 10 highquality standard signals to a 
single transponder he said the same technique would apply to a 
cable channel or a broadcast signal 
the company plans to develop the compression technology for 
overseas markets he said lowering costs for satellite time and 
increasing available channels 
ultimately what were looking for is video on demand the 
video store in the sky walker said you can see the day where 
therell be 10 movies on 10 channels on 10 transponders 24 hours a 
day

the legislature moved quickly tuesday on a 
528 million compromise school finance reform plan by easily passing 
the tax and fee increases needed to pay for it including a 
quartercent state sales tax hike 
the senate passed a separate bill outlining school finance 
reforms with a 291 vote and a measure making budget cuts and state 
budget transfers with a 300 vote 
the reform and budgetcutting bills were sent to the house 
increases in the state sales tax mixed drink and tobacco levies and 
some state fees were passed by the house and senate and sent to gov 
bill clements 
i am extremely happy because there is light at the end of the 
tunnel and its not a freight train this time said house speaker 
gib lewis 
democratic legislative leaders and the republican governor agreed 
on the school finance reform package friday after a threemonth 
deadlock on how to address a state supreme court order to give more 
money to poor school districts 
the funding package would pump extra money into the 135 
billionayear school finance system and would raise an extra 100 
million to bail out financially strapped social service programs 
clements killed two previous plans because they each required a 
halfcent increase in the sales tax but he compromised at the 
quartercent level friday saying he wanted to fend off court 
intervention in the school system 
the house could take up the school finance reform bill wednesday 
lewis said the house public education committee endorsed the 
measure with a 61 vote tuesday 
beyond funding changes the reform bill would make changes 
designed to improve education performance and accountability 
it would allow expansion of the prekindergarten program to 
3yearolds in the 199192 school year increase testing of 
students and give the governor the authority to appoint the state 
education commissioner presently appointed by the state board of 
education 
the tax measure approved 11723 by the house and 300 by the 
senate would 
raise the sales tax to 6 cents on the dollar 
raise the cigarette tax by 15 cents a pack to 41 cents 
increase the tax rate on chewing tobacco snuff and smoking 
tobacco from 28125 percent to 35213 percent of the factory list 
price 
increase the gross receipts tax on the sale of mixed drinks from 
12 percent to 14 percent 
two other measures approved would double the fees for obtaining a 
duplicate drivers license from 5 to 10 and raise by 50 percent 
the state fees for highway permits to transport items that exceed 
size and weight limits 
al kauffman an attorney for poor school districts said he 
expects to challenge the reform plan in court critics say the bill 
does not go far enough 
clements said the reaction was expected and typical of 
hardfought compromises 
i dont know anybody thats happy with the bill the fact that 
everybodys unhappy about it makes it probably a pretty good bill 
clements said

a mass grave believed to have been used by 
the rightist military has yielded 15 bound and bulletriddled bodies 
and could conceal as many more officials said tuesday 
the corpses in the atacama desert are believed to be those of 
leftists rounded up and killed by army troops after a 1973 coup 
human rights officials said the discovery prompted renewed calls by 
relatives groups for the new civilian government to prosecute 
officers 
digging continued tuesday under judicial supervision at the 
longsecret grave outside the fishing village of pisagua on the 
pacific coast 1185 miles north of santiago 
rights activists and government officials said the body count had 
risen from eight on sunday to 15 late monday digging began saturday 
belisario velasco an interior ministry subsecretary told 
reporters in santiago that there may be an equal number of 
cadavers yet to be uncovered 
sergio hevia a lawyer for the roman catholic churchs human 
rights agency said in a telephone interview that all of the bodies 
showed signs of having been executed 
he said the bodies had bullet wounds the hands were tied and 
many were blindfolded all the bodies were wrapped in tightly bound 
sacks he said 
digging so far has been limited to a single trench but hevia 
said authorities planned to open two more possible gravesites 
after taking power in a violent coup on sept 11 1973 the 
military ran a detention camp for leftists in pisagua about 30 
prisoners were executed or shot while allegedly trying to escape 
but their bodies were never handed over to relatives according to 
rights groups 
the rightwing military regime headed by gen augusto pinochet 
handed over power on march 11 to an elected government headed by 
president patricio aylwin 
at a news conference tuesday in santiago a national organization 
made up of the relatives of victims of military repression called 
for the government to show firmness in clearing up the truth and 
doing justice 
a healthy solid and stable democracy is based on 
investigation prosecution and proper criminal sanction within a 
state of law of those responsible for human rights violations 
the group declared in a written statement distributed to reporters 
they called on a retired army general carlos forestier to hand 
over information on the pisagua deaths forestier was then division 
commander and military judge for the area he now works for a 
private santiagobased arms manufacturer 
pinochet decreed a blanket amnesty covering all human rights 
violations that occurred from the time of the coup through march 
1978 
pinochet remains commander of the 60000man army and has said 
he will not permit prosection of his men 
the mass grave was discovered by a churchsponsored human rights 
agency the solidarity vicariate 
local newspapers said the agency was led to the site by a doctor 
alberto neumann who recently returned from exile in west germany 
the doctor had been imprisoned at the pisagua camp and was 
forced to witness the execution of five fellow prisoners and to 
confirm the victims deaths before they were buried in a trench 
already containing six other bodies the santiago daily fortin 
mapocho reported 
neumann was set free by mistake and sought asylum in the west 
german embassy the newspaper reported 
the bodies are being taken to a police lab for tests to determine 
their identities authorities said the remains are well preserved 
because of the areas extremely dry climate

the 200000 that congress appropriated for 
renovations of the vice presidents official home did not come 
near covering the cost of the project marilyn quayle said tuesday 
mrs quayle wife of vice president dan quayle also said the 
electrical wiring on the third floor was so old that the house had 
become a firetrap 
renovation of the third floor of the 19thcentury mansion should 
be finished in about three weeks she said 
the project including new wiring updated plumbing new heating 
and air conditioning new walls and new plaster will cost about 
320000 said denise balzano an aide to mrs quayle 
the federal funds are being supplemented by private 
contributions so far close to 250000 has been raised balzano 
said some of the contributions will also be used for furnishings 
she added 
the third floor of the house on the naval observatory grounds is 
being renovated to accommodate the quayles three children when 
president bush lived in the house as vice president the third floor 
had been used as barbara bushs office a maids bedroom and for 
storage 
during the renovations the quayles have been sleeping in the two 
secondfloor bedrooms 
mrs quayle said the building was the most charming house in 
the world but had major safety problems 
when the family returned from a spring vacation this year the 
construction crew showed mrs quayle charred timbers behind a 
ceiling light in the room where one of the children had slept the 
workers told her that when they took out the light the charred 
timbers were still warm 
we were living in a fire trap she said the wiring had not 
been replaced when you touched it the covering crumbled it was so 
old 
when the heating and air conditioning units were removed big 
sheets of crumbling asbestos were found 
this is where the air was being sucked in to blow into my 
childrens rooms she said 
believe me the appropriation from congress did not come near 
to covering what you have to do for an old building she said 
a study by the general services administration and the white 
house office of administration found the house needed about 14 
million in repairs 
for this fiscal year congress appropriated 200000 for the 
thirdfloor project and 120000 to make the house accessible to the 
handicapped 
the white house is seeking 320000 to continue the work in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 balzano said

prime minister brian mulroney emerged from talks 
aimed at salvaging the meech lake accord to report a little 
progress tuesday 
it was his third day of closeddoor constitutional meetings with 
the 10 provincial premiers known collectively as first 
ministers 
mulroney who backs the accord said the others had asked him to 
leave the meeting briefly to report small but unspecified advances 
i want to make sure that no one misunderstands he said 
before returning to the downtown conference center this is a 
small degree of progress as opposed to an enormous degree of 
progress 
theres a great deal of work left to do and well continue this 
work 
the meech lake accord signed in 1987 was designed to win 
quebecs approval of the 1982 constitution it recognizes largely 
frenchspeaking quebec with 67 million of canadas 25 million 
people as a distinct society 
it also gives all provinces expanded powers including a veto on 
senate changes 
the process began to unravel when provinces that originally 
approved the agreement reneged following elections which instituted 
new leadership 
the dispute over reforming the upper chamber proved to be the 
main sticking point 
all 10 provinces must approve the accord by june 23 or it will 
expire manitoba and newfoundland are the two holdouts new 
brunswick premier frank mckenna agreed on monday after intense 
discussions to go along 
together premiers gary filmon of manitoba and clyde wells of 
newfoundland have three years in office and represent only 15 
million canadians 
im not sure youd call it a common front were just 
discussing common concerns wells said after a meeting with filmon 
on monday 
wells is fundamentally opposed to meech lake he takes particular 
exception to the distinct society status the deal would grant 
quebec and the prospect of a quebec veto over senate reform 
filmon wants assurances the distinct society clause wont take 
precedence over canadas charter of rights and freedoms and 
recognition of the rights of women and natives

the united states and the soviet union 
on tuesday edged closer to an understanding on the military future 
of germany but kept the results of their postsummit deliberations 
secret 
the area of mutual understanding on these complex issues seems 
to be broadening soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
said after a twohour session with secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
asked if they had made progress baker said i think we did 
on the table at the soviet embassy were a ninepoint western 
package of assurances against german aggression and a soviet 
proposal to enhance trust between nato and the warsaw pact 
baker will take the results to a nato council meeting in scotland 
on thursday and shevardnadze to a warsaw pact session in moscow at 
the end of the week 
the western assurances include a promise that a unified germany 
would not acquire nuclear or chemical weapons and that nato forces 
would not move into what is now east germany after the merged 
country joined the western camp 
the soviet proposal meanwhile involves an exchange of political 
statements between nato and the warsaw pact which shevardnadze said 
is governed by a defensive doctrine that does not threaten the 
west 
baker who first heard about the idea during superpower talks in 
washington last weekend said he knew a little bit more about the 
soviet proposition 
shevardnadze declined to provide any details to reporters not 
for the time being its too early he said we need to do some 
more work on that 
he said the two superpowers along with britain france west 
germany and east germany would explore the subject at their next 
twoplusfour session 
shevardnadze was referring to the meeting of the foreign 
ministers of the four world war ii allies and the two germanys 
tentatively scheduled to be held in berlin on june 21 
the german issue also is the central topic at the north atlantic 
council meeting in turnberry scotland that begins thursday and at 
the the warsaw pact meeting in moscow at the end of the week 
additionally shevardnadze said we discussed future contacts 
we set no dates or venues but we concluded we need those future 
contacts 
the steppedup pace of eastwest discussion of germanys military 
future reflects a decision by president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to pursue a settlement even though none was 
reached at their washington summit which ended sunday 
we need to do some homework shevardnadze said we need to 
explore some options 
he described his meeting with baker as very useful and that 
he was pleased with their discussion

healing

a missing pooch named buford was at the 
heart of a dogged custody battle tuesday as town officials waited 
for its master to return the mutt that apparently fled new owners 
who claimed it at the dog pound 
james murdock lost ownership of buford when he failed to pay 
required fees and fines within 10 days of the strays capture said 
town dog officer robert battistoni 
my opinion is that the man doesnt want to pay battistoni 
said everyone else has to pay 
man and dog were reunited saturday when murdock said buford 
leaped into the back of his pickup truck outside a doughnut shop 
now neither can be found 
the shorthaired pointer apparently ran away from its new owners 
who officials declined to identify but not everyone accepted that 
theory 
to me its amazing that a dog gets loose and jumps in the 
truck said town spokesman karl stinehart i dont know if its 
like lassie and it has a homing signal 
after buford was picked up by authorities in midmay murdock was 
told would have to pay dog pound boarding fees and a fine for 
violating town leash laws stinehart said 
an exact bill had not been computed but it would amount to about 
100 officials said 
when the new owner reported the dog missing authorities visited 
murdock who initially denied having buford he was ordered to 
return the dog but no deadline was given stinehart said 
murdock was contacted by the the springfield unionnews after the 
weekend reunion but had little to say beyond his account of their 
reunion 
its our dog he said 
telephone calls by the associated press to murdocks home rang 
unanswered tuesday and an official at his workplace said he was not 
there 
town officials said they want to reach a settlement rather than 
seek any criminal charges against murdock 
battistoni said the dogs new owners are willing to give buford 
back to murdock if they are reimbursed the adoption charge they paid 
stinehart questioned murdocks attachment to buford because he 
didnt claim the dog while it was at the pound 
if someone really wants a dog or if its as important to them 
as a child then theyre going to get it within the time period 
he said

rotary international the worldwide service 
organization opened its first club in the soviet union on tuesday 
expanding its network to 169 nations 
the moscow club has 25 members including businessmen a theater 
manager and the head of a translation agency officials of the group 
said 
the organization has never had a club in moscow it was evicted 
from lithuania latvia and estonia after those independent states 
were annexed by the soviet union during world war ii said rotary 
president hugh archer 
it was also evicted from 19 other countries where heavy 
socialist ideology was the one selected by the government said 
archer of dearborn mich 
in the ussr being a socialist country it too had that 
impression that rotary was not a welcome member in its society he 
said 
in the past three years rotary began receiving inquiries from 
soviet officials and citizens the political changes that have 
occurred in eastern europe opened the door even wider and the 
organization was invited this year to open a moscow club he said 
rotary also plans to open branches in leningrad kiev and 
irkutsk the official tass news agency reported 
viktor mozolin a lawyer and business law professor who is 
president of the moscow club said its opening was connected to 
the whole process of democratic reform in the soviet union 
when asked whether the communist party and other soviet agencies 
did not already perform the humanitarian and service activities that 
rotary sponsors mozolin said there would be the duplication of 
some functions which belong in this country to the communist party 
as well as our komsomol and the unions and maybe some other 
humanitarian organizations but i dont think this will be a 
repetition of the functions 
komsomol is the communist youth league 
the club is seeking to join together people from different 
professions and various political views mozolin said 
rotary which brings together community and business leaders to 
build international goodwill opened clubs this year in east germany 
and czechoslovakia archer said

a border war sparked by a politicians 
claim that portsmouth naval shipyard is in new hampshire spilled 
over into maine on tuesday as the states attorneys general met to 
discuss the skirmish 
we had an excellent meeting but i certainly saw nothing that 
would indicate that the portsmouth naval shipyard is not in maine 
attorney general james e tierney said after a closeddoor session 
with his new hampshire counterpart john p arnold 
arnold stopped short of saying he believes the shipyard is in new 
hampshire but he said evidence produced a day earlier by us rep 
bob smith a republican running for the senate was serious 
from new hampshires standpoint i would not view it as a 
carnival issue arnold said 
the two states agreed to continue negotiations as they try to 
resolve the dispute tierney and arnold refused to disclose 
specifics of their discussions 
critics have said smith brought up the issue to gain publicity in 
his gop primary campaign 
tierney requested the meeting with arnold a week before a 
contested primary election in which he hopes to become the 
democratic nominee in maines 1st congressional district race but 
he disputed the suggestion that he might trying to bolster his own 
ambitions 
i would be delighted if congressman smith had not had his press 
conference a day earlier in portsmouth nh tierney said 
should new hampshire take maine to court the case would go 
directly to the us supreme court tierney asked arnold to refrain 
from doing so but arnold was not ready to surrender new hampshires 
potential claim to seaveys island in the piscataqua river the 
shipyards location 
new hampshire residents who work at the shipyard pay maine income 
tax and they are particularly angry over a socalled spousal tax 
that maine levies on joint returns that taxes the income of the 
spouse who works in maine based on the entire households income 
even if some comes from new hampshire which has no personal income 
tax 
according to victor bourre a shipyard worker and new hampshire 
resident who started exploring the question in 1987 because he was 
tired of paying the maine income tax the territory now known as 
maine originally included all land beyond north and east of the 
piscataqua river 
king george iis 1737 ruling settled a border dispute between new 
hampshire and massachusetts then both british colonies that ruling 
moved the boundary between new hampshire and maine then part of 
massachusetts to the middle of the river he said 
tierney and arnold said their staffers would meet within the next 
few weeks to discuss the issue further the next meeting will be in 
new hampshire 
arnold brought documents purporting to show that the shipyard is 
really in new hampshire because of boundaries that were set up in 
colonial days tierney said he would review new hampshires 
evidence but he plans to stick to boundaries that were in place 
when maine became a state in 1820 
if the states end up slugging it out before the supreme court 
the case could take years to resolve and cost each side millions of 
dollars tierney said lawyers might have to go to england to 
research documents dating back centuries and expensive expert 
witnesses would have to be assembled he said

presbyterians on tuesday adopted a new 
statement of faith that mixes traditional christian beliefs with 
environmental concerns and images of god as both mother and father 
commissioners to the 202nd general assembly of the presbyterian 
church usa stood up and cheered after voting 49925 for the 
confession that represents the first statement of faith since a 1983 
merger healed a civil warera split over slavery 
we must agree on what we believe before we can agree on much 
else assembly moderator price henderson gwynn iii said after the 
vote 
if the document is approved by twothirds of the denominations 
177 regional presbyteries and again by the 1991 general assembly it 
will become the 11th statement of faith in the denominations book 
of confessions 
in other business the assembly voted to allocate 1 million for 
a fiveyear program to aid american black men and to advocate 
normalizing relations with cuba 
some observers said the confession is particularly important for 
the 29 millionmember denomination which has lost a third of its 
members during the past quartercentury amid some criticism that it 
lacked a strong identity 
the theological integrity of the presbyterian church depends on 
the statement of faith said the rev jack stotts chairman of the 
committee that developed the statement 
stotts president of austin theological seminary in texas said 
the confession was designed to retain the historic faith while 
speaking both in the idiom of the contemporary world and to the 
concerns of the contemporary world 
the statement upholds centuriesold church teachings that jesus 
christ was both fully human and fully god and that god raised jesus 
from the dead to offer eternal life 
reflecting more recent church concerns the confession states 
human beings deserve gods condemnation for the way they exploit 
nature and threaten death to the planet entrusted to our care 
among other contemporary elements the statement declares that 
god calls women and men to all ministries of the church and likens 
god to both a mother who will not forsake her nursing child and a 
father who runs to welcome the prodigal home 
in a denomination where slavery led to a 122year split between 
its northern and southern branches the new statement affirms god 
makes everyone equally in gods image male and female of every 
race and people to live as one community 
the rev john mulder who helped direct a threeyear study of the 
church involving 55 research projects said one of the findings was 
that the increasing diversity of beliefs and moral behavior within 
the church placed the denomination at risk of losing a clear and 
welldefined identity 
but he said the new confession is a hopeful sign for the church 
i think the statement of faith is a reflection of the churchs 
ability even in the face of considerable diversity that we are 
still capable of forming a unified statement of christian belief 
that is consistent with our tradition said mulder president of 
louisville presbyterian seminary in kentucky 
the striking thing to me about the confession no 1 is that 
it got written at all 
the church whose membership is less than 2 percent black voted 
to spend 1 million over five years to develop and implement 
outreach and selfhelp programs for black men 
i felt good when it passed said connie a allison a black 
elder from kings mountain nc he said the church needs to address 
issues of job training and providing equal opportunities for blacks 
on uscuba relations the assembly voted 39552 to work toward 
normalized relations including reducing trade and travel 
restrictions cooperating on controlling drug traffic and 
postponing plans for direct television broadcasts to cuba 
a resolution calling for free elections in cuba was defeated by 
35985

stop kids dont lift that manhole cover 
you wont find raphael or donatello or any of the teenage mutant 
ninja turtles down there theyre just makebelieve 
that message from champaign school officials came as a surprise 
to some first graders found peeking into a sewer in search of the 
fictional crimefighters 
the result was a ninja turtle alert sent last week to all 
elementary schools by arlene blank assistant superintendent 
somehow two firstgrade girls managed to lift a manhole cover 
off said blank by the time the adults got there they had been 
joined by two firstgrade boys 
one of the boys was about to climb down into the manhole 
their motive was simple 
they said they were looking for the teenage mutant ninja 
turtles said blank they were very serious about it 
worried that other children might try the same thing blank 
issued the alert 
her memo asks staff members to talk with pupils from 
prekindergarten through third grade and explain that the 
pizzaeating reptiles are not real 
blank said the youngsters could have been injured or drowned if 
they had fallen into the rainswollen sewer system 
i think some kids think they exist said kevin fletcher 8 
i dont think theyre really alive i like to think of them as 
makebelieve 
originally comic book characters the halfturtle halfhuman 
ninja warriors are the hottest kid craze since batman particularly 
since the release of a motion picture featuring them in march 
the premise dimestore pet turtles are dropped down a sewer 
manhole fall into radioactive slime grow to be 6 feet tall and are 
trained by a giant ninja rat to defend liberty 
the ninja turtles are a nice story but thats all they are

a teenager accused of leading a mob that 
stomped a man to death in a racial attack police likened to sharks 
in an eating frenzy should be tried as an adult the state 
supreme court ruled tuesday 
justices agreed with a juvenile court finding that the brutality 
of the attack and sentencing limits that would have forced his

murder and robbery in connection with the sept 24 1988 death of 
william j roberts 35 of north kingstown 
taylor was 16 when roberts was killed while allegedly trying to 
buy drugs at a providence housing project he turns 18 on june 26 
police officials at the time likened the attack to sharks in an 
eating frenzy and said it had racial overtones 
a witness testified that taylor who is black told roberts who 
was white ill kill you this is what i think about white 
people 
up to a dozen people joined in the attack witnesses said five 
were charged three youths pleaded guilty in juvenile court

conclude that taylor repeatedly jumped up and down on the face and 
chest of the victim 
taylor has denied being the mob leader and wanted to be tried as 
a juvenile taylors public defender chris oneill declined to 
comment on the ruling citing office policy 
the high court also denied taylors appeal of a ruling that he be 
held without bail at an adult lockup trial was scheduled for june

a palestinian guerrilla leader captured in last 
weeks failed sea raid said tuesday his squad had orders to spray 
the tel aviv hotel district with machine gun fire and kill any 
person we encountered 
he also said his palestine liberation front squad was trained by 
libyan instructors in that north african country for 18 months 
carried out joint exercises with the libyan navy and was accompanied 
en route to israel by a libyan lieutenant colonel 
the captured guerrilla identified as ahmed mohammed yusuf the 
squads deputy commander spoke on israel televisions 
arabiclanguage nightly news the curly haired heavyset yusuf 28 
wore olive green militarystyle clothing and spoke calmly 
his remarks if proven accurate provide the most detailed 
account of the may 30 raid in which two guerrilla boats sped toward 
the israeli coast one was intercepted at sea and a second one 
landed near a beach south of tel aviv four guerrillas were killed 
and 12 captured 
asked what orders he had yusuf said the target area was the 
hotel district first to bombard the area from the sea with katyusha 
rockets after shelling and machine gun fire to go ashore and 
storm the target they asked me to enter the sheraton hotel to 
kill everyone inside 
when asked to clarify yusuf added the targets of the 
operation were civilian and not military we were asked not to have 
mercy on anyone and to kill any person we encountered 
his account contradicted statements by the palestinian factions 
leader mohammed abbas who has said the attack was aimed at military 
targets not civilians 
the remarks could cast a further shadow on the usplo dialogue 
that was launched by washington after plo chief yasser arafat 
renounced terrorism in december 1988 
a senior us administration official said in washington on 
monday that the dialogue was clearly in jeopardy following the 
attempted raid on israel 
the united states is demanding that the plo disassociate itself 
from the attack and condemn it washington is also asking the plo to 
expel abbas who is part of the plos 15member executive committee 
yusuf said libyan instructors taught the squad how to swim and 
operate small rubber boats and gave lessons in navigation and naval 
tactics 
a frigate accompanied us and participated in an exercise with 
us he said the man from the libyan navy responsible for us 
would give us orders 
the libyan officer identified by yusuf as lt col zuheir also 
accompanied the guerrillas on the civilian libyan vessel that 
carried the squad toward israel also aboard was abualaz the 
deputy leader of the plf said yusuf 
if captured the instructions were that no one was to admit 
where we trained who helped us and who gave us weapons and boats 
yusuf said 
yusuf who was born in kuneitra syria said he was a member of 
arafats mainstream fatah group before joining the abbas faction in 
1988

of commercial abuses aimed at children were cnn newsroom an 
episode of murphy brown and wonderworks 
except for special award for cbs murphy brown no other 
award went to a commercial network series the awards will be 
presented at a luncheon wednesday

children has replaced creativity with products embedded in tv 
programs and ads introducing and even interrupting kids videos

commercial stations in only two cities pittsburgh and boston 
won awards from the group 
its a nationwide contest so it says that kids across the

for the country as a whole local programs for children are kind of 
an extinct dinosaur 
charren said she dedicated the ceremony to henson because his 
creations will continue to inspire television producers who care 
about children 
action for childrens television was formed 22 years ago in part 
to push for legislation to limit the number of television 
advertisements directed at children 
ktvu in san francisco and a statewide campaign in alaska header

a mystery witness in the bensonhurst racial 
attack who emerged after the case went to court admitted tuesday she 
made up her story prosecutors said 
it is now clear that she was not a witness to events of that 
tragic night as she had claimed brooklyn district attorney 
charles j hynes said in a statement after the woman was interviewed 
by prosecutors 
several weeks ago the woman identified variously as iris and 
maria told reporters she watched as a white mob surrounded yusuf 
hawkins and that she saw joseph fama fatally shoot the black 
teenager through the chest however she canceled several scheduled 
meetings with prosecutors and was interviewed by them for the first 
time last week only after she was located by the police 
during that meeting last thursday she repeated to prosecutors the 
story she had told newspapers and television stations 
earlier today the woman accompanied by her husband gave a 
statement retracting all her previous accounts hynes said 
he said she would not be charged for making the false statements 
to prosecutors 
her motives remain unclear it cant be explained or 
accounted for a lawenforcement source said 
the woman was unable to pick defendants yet to be tried out of a 
photo array and said her account came to her in a dream the 
source said 
prosecutors had said that if her account of the aug 23 slaying 
was true she could have been a witness in future bensonhurst trials 
and in a possible federal investigation into civil rights charges 
against keith mondello 
mondello the alleged ringleader of the white mob that chased and 
surrounded hawkins was acquitted may 18 of murder and manslaughter

kiss of the spider woman is nothing if 
not ambitious an attempt to stretch the american musical theater 
beyond such landmark concept musicals as cabaret company 
and follies 
if its ambition sometimes overwhelms its execution well that is 
why there is new musicals a forprofit laboratory for the 
development of new shows at the state university of new york in 
purchase the show playing at the schools performing arts center 
runs through june 24 
but laboratory is not the word to describe this production 
directed with remarkable fluidity by harold prince kiss of the 
spider woman is of broadway size scope and quality and thats 
why it may be so difficult to really change the show without a major 
overhauling of its production values 
the musical is based on the manuel puig novel that later became a 
movie starring william hurt and raul julia it tells the story of 
two men jailed in an unnamed latin american country valentin is a 
political prisoner molina is a sexual offender a flamboyant 
homosexual charged with molesting a minor 
spider woman chronicles their time together in a cell from 
hostility to acceptance to understanding to love what cements their 
relationship is molinas retelling of old movie plots particularly 
a hoary 1940s movie musical called man overboard 
numbers from this technicolor song and dance alternate with grim 
prison scenes if the idea sounds familiar its similiar to what 
prince and the songwriting team of john kander and fred ebb did in 
cabaret their first collaboration nearly 25 years ago in that 
show set in the late 1920s a berlin cabaret became a symbol for 
germanys ominous embrace of hitler 
in spider woman the symbolism is not as obvious the movie 
musical numbers pale in comparison to the story of two men who 
gradually gain mutual selfrespect through the telling of this hokey 
celluoid tale in which molina and the movie heroine become one 
the kander and ebb score contains some of the teams most complex 
and challenging work kanders melodies are among the best he has 
ever written and they are showcased effectively in michael gibsons 
evocative orchestrations ebbs lyrics dont settle for the obvious 
or glib 
their numbers range from sweet love songs theres a stunning 
quartet called dear one to stirring political anthems to 
exotic tropical dance numbers 
the musical actually contains a score within a score one set of 
songs being part of the movie musical molina is spinning for 
valentin its here where the musical falters not so much in the 
songs but in the conventional staging by choreographer susan stroman 
molina is enraptured by these movie musical scenes and 
theatergoers should be too but more often than not the numbers 
just mark time making one question molinas taste and obsession 
with the silver screen one particularly athletic number makes the 
male dance ensemble look like the cast of mister roberts doing 
aerobics 
not until nearly the end of the evening when the movie and real 
life merge in the driving rhythmic title song does stromans work 
come together 
playwright terrence mcnally who provided the book has more 
success particularly with the quiet intimate scenes between the 
two prisoners john rubinstein never stooping to caricature makes 
a credible even moving molina kevin gray is more enigmatic as the 
mysterious political prisoner valentin although he has the shows 
best voice and uses it well 
lauren mitchell who plays the shows title character is saddled 
with most of those mediocre movie production numbers but her 
personality is not forceful enough making one wish for the sensual 
and hypnotizing sonia braga who galvanized the movie version of 
spider woman 
the physical production of the show designed by thomas lynch is 
huge filling the stage of a theater that has the ambiance and charm 
of an airplane hangar the supposedly tiny prison cell for molina 
and valentin looks bigger than most manhattan apartments 
the distance between the playing area and the audience puts any 
meaningful character development at a disadvantage although the 
wide spaces allow lighting designer peter a kaczorowski to splash 
some stunning displays of light symbolizing prison bars across the 
stage 
prince and his creative team have work to do despite their 
strong uncompromising story and wonderful score if the show 
eventually is to make its way to broadway kiss of the spider 
woman knows what it wants to say now it just has to find a more 
effective way to say it

greyhound lines inc on tuesday promised to 
continue service despite a bankruptcy reorganization filing that 
delighted striking drivers and raised questions about the future of 
the nations only intercity bus carrier 
listing liabilities of almost 540 million the dallasbased 
company filed monday for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 
creditors while it tries to reorganize its finances 
us bankruptcy judge richard schmidt scheduled a hearing for 
thursday morning in brownsville 
passengers wont see any changes at all said liz hale a 
greyhound spokeswoman 
there were no reports of riders flocking for refunds after the 
filing but those who wanted refunds should contact local customer 
service representatives she said all tickets were being honored 
she said 
greyhound dial corp which leases some buses and buildings to 
the bus company set 100 million aside from aftertax earnings to 
establish a reserve for possible losses related to greyhound lines 
greyhound dial sold the bus lines in 1987 for more than 270 
million but still holds preferred stock and notes from greyhound 
lines 
the bankruptcy filing action is a positive stabilizing move 
which should help solidify the troubled position of greyhound lines 
and go a long way to ensuring the longterm survival of the bus 
lines john w teets greyhound dials president and chief 
executive officer said in a statement 
greyhound has seen ridership and revenue fall since most of its 
6300 drivers walked out march 2 in a sometimes violent dispute over 
wages and job security 
on may 7 greyhound lines chairman fred g currey said the strike 
had become irrelevant because the carrier had enough drivers to 
operate the company claims it now is serving communities that 
provided 98 percent of its revenue last year 
the bankruptcy filing had been widely expected greyhound lost 
56 million in the first quarter and has missed more than 17 
million in interest and lease payments putting it in default on 
some agreements the company recently proposed buying back 225 
million of its highinterest junk bonds at a steep discount 
greyhounds chapter 11 petition listed more than 1800 pages of 
creditors assets of 50878 million and liabilities of 53978 
million 
union officials who maintain that greyhound has not been 
operating anywhere near as many of its routes as it claims cheered 
the bankruptcy filing 
it illustrates the point that fred currey has been lying about 
the companys finances lying about ridership and lying about the 
ability of scab drivers to serve the public said michael holden 
vice president of amalgamated transit union local 1205 in boston 
wr gibson jr president kansas citybased local 1313 said 
the union probably would ask the bankruptcy court to appoint a 
trustee to manage the company 
were going to plan on replacing fred currey gibson said 
tuesday 
unions striking against eastern airlines got a bankruptcy judge 
to appoint a trustee for that company earlier this year although 
such a move is considered unusual 
several industry analysts predicted greyhound would emerge from 
reorganization as a smaller carrier servicing even fewer routes 
especially to small communities than before the strike 
i would see it as a very positive kind of move said jim 
cammisa publisher of travel industry indicators in miami 
prior to the strike they were marginally profitable on an income 
basis theres no reason with their ridership up to 75 or 80 
percent why they cant pass a breakeven profit level fairly soon 
others said the reorganization could help greyhound raise badly 
needed working capital but would delay the companys attempted 225 
million junk bond buyback 
the chapter 11 filing buys time for greyhound at the start of the 
busy summer travel season but may force it to sell assets and 
jettison bus routes said phua k young a shearson lehman hutton 
analyst in new york 
serving a lot of smaller communities im afraid has gone the 
way of the dinosaurs a lot of momandpop bus operators out there 
are just waiting to see what lines that greyhound wants to get rid 
of he said thats where the future lies for regional 
carriers

prices of junk bonds used to finance part of 
donald trumps empire fell again tuesday amid speculation that 
negotiations between the developer and his bankers would further 
reduce the value of the securities 
bondholders meanwhile filed a class action lawsuit seeking to 
block trump and his associates from promoting his new taj mahal 
casino at the expense of the trump plaza and trump castle holdings 
in atlantic city nj 
the price of 14 percent bonds used to back the taj mahal was 
quoted at 54 to 55 per 100 in face value late tuesday down from 
5658 on monday 
junk bonds tied to other trump holdings fared somewhat better 
the trump plaza casinos 12 percent issues were quoted at 8182 
down from 8283 and 13 percent issues backing the trump castle 
casino were little changed at 5960 
prices for the issues fell sharply monday with the taj bonds 
skidding as much as 10 when trump confirmed a report in the wall 
street journal that he has been meeting with major lenders who have 
grown increasingly uneasy about his ability to handle his reported 
2 billion in bank debt 
the lenders who include units of bankers trust co citicorp 
chase manhattan corp and manufacturers hanover trust co are said 
to be seeking a restructuring of the developers holdings including 
a possible sale of some trump assets 
the us district court lawsuit claimed trump gave the taj a 
confidential list of high level gamblers and affluent clientele 
of the trump plaza and trump castle without compensating the hotels 
for the information in violation of bond agreements 
the lawsuit claims trump also violated federal securities laws by 
not disclosing the transaction and seeks an order barring him from 
using any of the hotels information or assets to benefit the taj 
it also seeks unspecified damages for the sharp decline in value 
of the bonds trump plaza bonds have declined from 102 percent of 
face value to 82 percent since august while trump castle bonds 
dropped from 103 percent to 70 percent the lawsuit claimed 
trumps talks with the banks have been under way for about two 
weeks dan klores a spokesman for trump refused to say whether the 
two sides were meeting tuesday or to give any information beyond 
trumps brief statement on monday 
at this point these are things that are between the trump 
organization and other people and were not at liberty to talk about 
that klores said 
investors have been unsettled by reports that the banks were 
trying to prevent trump from making upcoming payments to junk 
bondholders such a move would devastate the value of the risky 
securities which are attractive to investors because they pay a 
much higher interest rate than other bonds 
trumps lenders are believed to be concerned that his holdings 
including the casinos are not producing enough cash to meet 
interest payments 
the developer has maintained in recent months he has no cash flow 
problems he did announce in late april that he was considering 
putting some of his assets on the block including the northeast 
air shuttle he bought from eastern airlines for 365 million last 
year but claimed he wanted to raise cash to buy new properties 
trumps other assets include the plaza hotel trump tower 
skyscraper and several apartment buildings in manhattan 
trumps lenders are concerned because of a downturn in the real 
estate market furthermore the 1 billion taj mahal which opened 
two months ago has not flourished amid the plethora of casinos in 
atlantic city 
the taj mahal junk bonds have been hit the hardest because they 
are seen as the riskiest investment analysts say the cash flow from 
the other casinos is more certain at this point than that of the taj 
mahal 
casino officials reported tuesday that the taj mahal posted a win 
of 365 million in may a monthly record for an atlantic city 
casino the win averaged 118 million a day industry analysts have 
estimated it needs to make between 1 million and 13 million a day 
to break even 
the journal reported that the big banks also were concerned that 
if trump does sell assets he might not be able to get the kind of 
prices that he claims they are worth 
the journal story followed a string of negative reports about how 
well trumps empire is doing forbes magazine recently sliced its 
estimate of the developers net worth to 500 million from more than 
15 billion 
trump has maintained he was having no liquidity problems

the british will get less for their money wednesday 
as a new smaller five pound note enters circulation engraved with a 
gracefully aging queen 
the new fiver the first in two decades is designed to combat 
hightechnology forgeries and cut production costs 
no item created by man cant be recreated said nigel 
bevittsmith manager of design and development at the bank of 
englands printing works what we try to do is to make it 
timeconsuming and as expensive as possible 
the dominant blue of the older note has been lightened from navy 
to turquoise and a blend of background colors was created to 
challenge sophisticated forgers who use modern color reproduction 
machines 
the position and color of the numbers has also been changed to 
foil counterfeiters and a silvercolored thread runs through the 
new note as it already does in 10 20 and 50 pound notes 
the bank of england which has already printed 200 million of the 
new notes said queen elizabeths new portrait shows the monarch 
gracefully aged the older fivepound note portrays the queen as 
a young delicate brunette 
railway pioneer george stephenson replaces the duke of wellington 
on the new notes which have been slightly reduced in size 
the fiver also contain a round turquoise symbol to make them more 
easily identifiable to the partially blind 
all english notes will be redesigned over the next four years and 
will be 16 percent to 22 percent small the bank of england said 
bevittsmith said the bank will save a few million pounds 
from the size reduction

prime minister yitzhak shamir is having trouble 
meeting the demands of potential coalition partners as he nears his 
deadline for forming israels next government a senior party 
official said tuesday 
the assessment by cabinet minister ehud olmert a leading member 
of shamirs rightwing likud bloc comes just a day after the prime 
minister said he would have a majority in parliament to form a 
rightwing coalition government and that he expected to swear in a 
new cabinet next week 
different parties are raising different demands olmert said 
maybe each one of these demands is just and true in their own 
eyes but when they all have to come together in the framework of 
eight parties forming a coalition it is sometimes impossible 
we are making a tremendous effort to find a common denominator 
that would allow the coalition to be formed he added speaking on 
israel television 
despite early predictions that he would quickly form a new 
government shamir has spent the past 40 days trying to forge an 
alliance with small religious and rightwing parties 
a new coalition would replace the national unity government the 
likud formed with the centerleft labor party that alliance was 
toppled march 15 in a vote of noconfidence by the 120member 
parliament 
shamirs mandate from president chaim herzog to form a new 
government expires on midnight thursday

the soviet union said tuesday it plans 
to withdraw a very substantive part of its nuclear arsenal from 
central europe this year 
the soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told a 
35nation conference on human rights the soviets will cut 1500 
nuclear warheads by the end of the year from central europe 
in addition 60 tactical missile launchers and 3200 artillery 
guns capable of firing nuclear shells would be cut he said 
secretary of state james a baker iii in copenhagen for the 
conference said the western allies welcomed the announcement and 
added the soviets have quite an advantage in these weapons 
but he said it was unclear how many such tactical weapons the 
soviets had previously intended to withdraw and whether they would 
be destroyed or redeployed 
shevardnadze said of the reduction this is going to be a very 
substantive amount he said relatively few weapons would remain 
but he refused to be more specific 
asked if the weapons would be destroyed shevardnadze said 
its our intention to withdraw the weapons and discuss destruction 
at a subsequent phase 
in his speech to the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe shevardnadze said that by freeing europe of nuclear 
weapons we give further latitude to man 
european foreign ministers responded carefully to the soviet 
plan citing the soviet superiority in shortrange weaponry 
we have to look at this in detail said roland dumas of 
france adding anything that goes in the direction of disarmament 
is a good initiative 
hansdietrich genscher of west germany told reporters after 
meeting privately with baker we first have to know what is behind 
this idea of the soviets he said he would await the details 
danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen said his first 
impression was that theres not much new in the proposal 
disarmament is likely to be a top item at the agenda of another 
conference on security and cooperation in europe meeting in paris in 
december the csce is comprised of the united states canada and all 
european states except albania 
dumas told reporters the paris summit would probably be held dec 
1921 to discuss the reconciliation of europe a preparatory 
meeting was called for july 10 in vienna 
genscher said after meeting shevardnadze that there was a broad 
understanding the vienna talks on conventional weapons which had 
slowed in recent months should be concluded before the paris 
meeting 
shevardnadze also held out hope of a compromise on the military 
future of a united germany which the west wants to see as a full 
member of the nato alliance 
nato and the sovietled warsaw pact alliance were undergoing a 
process of transformation and starting to cooperate in this way 
we can find a compromise on the german issue he said 
baker was carrying a package of proposals to present to 
shevardnadze that are designed to overcome soviet reluctance to let 
germany stay in nato 
presidents george bush and mikhail s gorbachev failed to resolve 
differences over the issue during their washington summit over the 
weekend 
bakers proposal includes an offer of help by west germany to 
build housing for soviet soldiers returning home from eastern 
europe and other economic inducements 
it also includes reassurances that a larger and stronger germany 
would not threaten the soviet union move beyond its present borders 
or acquire nuclear or chemical weapons us officials said 
the copenhagen meeting granted observer status to albania in a 
further sign that europes last hardline communist state wants to 
end its isolation 
an application by lithuania to attend as an observer was 
rejected however denmarks ellemannjensen said no consensus was 
possible since the soviets would object to seating a separate 
lithuanian delegation the baltic republic declared itself 
independent from the soviet union in march and the kremlin has 
imposed economic sanctions in an effort to end the independence 
drive

south korean president roh taewoo arrived 
tuesday night to discuss with president bush his governments 
dramatic new push for normal relations with the soviet union as a 
step toward reunion with north korea 
roh foreign minister choi hojoong and members of their 
delegation landed at nearby andrews air force base from san 
francisco where roh held unprecedent talks monday with soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev at the end of gorbachevs us visit 
this historic meeting has improved prospects for peace on the 
korean peninsula and eventual korean unification state department 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said tuesday noting the soviet 
unions longtime role in korean affairs 
it launched north korea as a rival to ussponsored south korea 
after world war ii and was north koreas ally and weapons provider 
in the 19501953 korean war 
boucher said the united states welcomes the prospect of normal 
relations between seoul and moscow forecast by roh after his talk 
with gorbachev 
rohs northern policy was a foreign affairs success leading 
to mondays summit with gorbachev but it has had negative 
consequences for human rights in south korea asia watch a 
private usbased human rights watchdog organization said tuesday 
asia watch recalled in a statement that president roh announced 
his northern policy in 1988 declaring that north korea would no 
longer be teated as an enemy but more as a partner in development 
and eventual reunification of the korean peninsula 
despite this dozens of south koreans have been jailed or 
otherwise harassed for advocating or working for precisely what 
the president himself now professes to be doing finding ways to 
reunify korea the statement said 
it urged bush and other us officials meeting roh during his 
tour to use every opportunity to press the south korean 
government to implement legal reforms including revisions of the 
national security law and to release those imprisoned for 
nonviolent political activity

former charlotte mayor harvey gantt won the 
democratic us senate runoff on tuesday and became the first black 
us senate nominee from north carolina in this century 
gantt defeated brunswick county district attorney mike easley 
and will challenge threeterm republican sen jesse helms in 
november 
with 99 percent of the states precincts reporting gantt had 
272576 votes or 57 percent to easleys 206397 or 43 percent 
how sweet it is gantt told chanting supporters at his 
victory celebration i want to tell you that god is good yes he 
is and today the people of this state showed their confidence in me 
with an overwhelming vote its a new day in north carolina 
gantt moved quickly to reinforce his support for a womans right 
to an abortion an emotional issue on which he and helms are polar 
opposites 
its not the business of government to interfere with a womans 
right to choose gantt said drawing a loud cheer from the crowd 
what we want is a senator who understands the importance of 
building a society for the 21st century 
earlier in the day gantt had said he was ready to get into 
this fight with helms im ready to get it on with him 
helms issued a twosentence statement congratulating gantt for 
his hardearned victory and easley for his hardfought race 
in a concession speech to supporters easley said its been a 
long and tough road i congratulate my good friend harvey gantt on 
running a strong campaign we all know that harvey is a leader in 
the democratic party and he will be a leader in the united states 
senate 
easley spokesman hampton dellinger said the victory bodes real 
well for gantt in the general election race 
the margin shows hes able to appeal to both black and white 
segments of the population dellinger said it shows a very 
strong possibility for him to defeat helms 
both candidates had campaigned more against helms than each 
other although both had hoped for a large voter turnout turnout 
was light between 15 and 17 percent according to elections 
director alex brock

gantt 47 characterized helms as out of step with the times and 
said he wouldnt be able to run for senate if helms views prevailed 
today 
both candidates attacked helms for his votes on social and 
environmental legislation the attacks prompted helms 68 to enter 
the political fray last week with commercials that accused the 
democratis of mudslinging he also attacked easley 40 for plea 
bargains he made as a prosecutor and gantt for his opposition to the 
death penalty 
the closest the two democrats came to a sharp exchange involved 
easleys listing of his differences with gantt in their first 
televised debate may 26 easley said he opposed tax funding of 
obscene art and a bill now before congress that would raise gasoline 
taxes and tobacco taxes 
in their second debate broadcast saturday gantt said easley had 
distorted his position on the federal tax bill by implying that he 
favored the new taxes 
gantt an architect by profession led the sixway may 8 primary 
with the help of black voters he gained 37 percent of the vote 
while easley finished second with 30 percent 
historically black candidates in north carolina have lost runoff 
elections that history led to a change in state election laws 
giving an outright primary victory to a candidate with more than 40 
percent of the vote under the old law a candidate needed more than 
50 percent to win

a reputed leader of an anticastro terrorist group 
sought by authorities since 1984 has been arrested in the bombings 
of three foreign consulates in miami in the early 1980s federal 
agents said 
jose ignacio gonzalez 48 was ordered held at the metropolitan 
correctional center south of miami until a witness can arrive from 
new york to testify in his bond hearing which was continued from 
tuesday until thursday 
gonzalez sought in the united states since 1984 was taken into 
custody early monday by guatemalan authorities expelled from that 
central american nation and arrested at miami international airport 
later in the day fbi spokesman paul miller said 
gonzalez is charged with bail jumping conspiracy to deal in 
firearms and possess and receive an unregistered destruction device 
he was believed to be the last member at large of the militant 
group omega 7 according to miller federal arrest warrants 
described gonzalez as a leader of the group 
omega 7 which was opposed to cubas communist government 
claimed responsibility for several bombings in the miami area in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s 
gonzalez has been sought on charges he placed bombs at the miami 
consulates of mexico nicaragua and venezuela countries that had 
official ties with fidel castros cuba

consulate which was heavily damaged 
gonzalez also is charged with transporting a bomb to the 
nicaraguan consulate on sept 2 1982 while that device did not

the sharp firstquarter decline in us 
productivity or production efficiency was centered almost entirely 
in the service sector and that makes the bad news even worse 
the reason in terms of employment the american economy is 
overwhelmingly a service economy meaning most people earn their 
living from jobs in the serviceproducing realm rather than the 
manufacture of goods 
rather than making nuts and bolts they use their skills to 
provide transportation communication power wholesale and retail 
trade banking real estate insurance health care research 
government services 
statistically speaking it is a little known world even by 
government which is one of the largest segments of that world 
washington releases masses of information about goods much less 
about the world of services 
popular impressions are even hazier most people have mental 
pictures of mining manufacturing and construction but they have no 
clear image of services as an industry something promised never 
delivered they might say 
yet three of four us workers are employed in the economys 
service or serviceproducing sector and most future employment 
growth for the next decade is likely to be in those areas 
moreover much of that growth is likely to be concentrated in 
just three service areas retail trade personal services such as 
health care and education and state and local government 
no wonder economists are appalled at firstquarter figures 
showing a 27 percent drop in productivity or output per hour 
worked they know that if productivity doesnt rise neither can 
living standards its that simple 
it shows in various others ways too most importantly in regard 
to global competition a nation that cannot efficiently join ideas 
and raw materials with manpower and money to produce goods and 
services cannot compete 
and it has a direct link to inflation most clearly seen in 
higher labor costs to produce results those higher costs of 
course necessitate higher prices which in turn force higher wage 
demands 
it is no coincidence for example that as productivity gains 
shrank over the past three decades some of the highest inflation 
and interest rates in a century burned the economy and helped bring 
on deep recessions 
those high interest rates in turn helped raise the cost of 
doing business and thereby contributed to the very productivity 
problem that led to them in the first place 
moreover those same high interest rates discouraged investment 
in more modern stateofthe art plants and equipment in a better 
educated work force in innovative computerenhanced measures all 
aimed at greater productivity 
lagging productivity is therefore a summary term for a whole 
basket of maladies that afflict the economy and end up in the cost 
of goods and services 
that long list certainly includes poor education high capital 
costs lack of innovation waste in health care political 
chicanery high legal expenses government overspending 
environmental abuse shortsighted management improper economic 
policies unmotivated workers lack of access to capital 
you might add to that list the misdirection of capital such as 
in the investment of billions of dollars in junk bonds and corporate 
takeovers in recent years instead of improvement of production 
techniques and worker education 
all these raise the costs of producing goods and services and 
thereby reduce production efficiency when production efficiency 
falls so does the ability to compete 
and if you dont compete these days you dont live very well

like the mighty mississippi in his signature 
song ol man river william warfield plans to keep rollin along 
his bassbaritone is still rich with musical thunder though 40 
springs have come and gone since he first became a national star 
singing the moving anthem about the hard life of black stevedores 
working on the mississippi river in the mgm movie show boat 
hes 70 now still on the road captivating audiences here and 
abroad and still sharing his art and wisdom with eager fans and 
students since 1974 hes taught at the champaignurbana campus of 
the university of illinois and his retirement from the music 
faculty is merely a technicality 
ill still teach but ill be able to do more outside things 
said warfield thumbing through a calendar in his small office in 
smith hall im booked up with performances through next may 
during his 54year career the versatile singer and pianist has 
run the gamut of show business from stints in churchs and 
nightclubs that merely paid the rent to performances on stage and 
screen 
the son of a baptist preacher his goal as a student at the 
eastman school of music at the university of rochester was not to 
see his name in lights but to teach 
i didnt have stars in my eyes and i wasnt sure you could make 
a living by singing said warfield in an interview it never 
occurred to me that i would be that lucky 
as luck would have it warfield joined the 1946 touring company 
of call me mister a broadway musical revue about soldiers 
getting out of the army after world war ii and their adjustment to 
civilian life he was bitten by the performance bug he appeared 
on stage with other future stars comedian buddy hackett 
comedianwriterdirector carl reiner and 
choreographerdancerdirector robert fosse 
i decided to stick around new york and try to make a career for 
myself said warfield 
his big break came in 1950 a canadian stockbroker attended 
nearly every one of warfields shows in a toronto nightclub and 
offered 500 to finance his concert debut at new yorks town hall 
the critics gave rave reviews to warfield whose oneman recital 
ranged from handel to experimental music with hymns spirtuals and 
blues 
my attitude was that id get a manager and make a living not 
that id become a star he said he did not realize the impact of 
his performance until the the reviews hit the street 
the saturday review said warfield had remarkable presence and 
range and the heraldtribune said he had a wideranged 
flexible and sumptuous voice newsweek called him one of the 
brightest stars to appear in music in years 
whew warfield recalled everything broke loose 
while performing at the invitation of the australian broadcasting 
commission warfields manager larney goodkind signed him to play 
joe the dockhand in the mgm version of show boat it was a role 
first created by stepin fetchit in 1929 and paul robeson in 1936 
it was during the early days of production that warfield 
delivered his famous onetake recording of ol man river 
intended as a dryrun with the orchestra to give warfield an idea of 
timing and balance it was flawless it reportedly brought tears to 
the eyes of the head of the studio louis mayer 
i had been singing ol man river since high school said 
warfield it never occurred to me that i would be singing it in a 
movie 
warfields career was in high gear and in 1952 he performed in 
porgy and bess during a tour of europe sponsored by the us 
state department he played opposite the opera star leontyne price 
they soon were married but the demands of two separate professional 
careers left them little time together they divorced in 1972 
in 1975 warfield gave a soldout concert in carnegie hall 
marking the 25th anniversary of his new york debut 
but his gifted baritone was not limited to singing he appeared 
as de lawd in the green pastures a 1957 hallmark hall of fame 
television production in 1984 he received a grammy award for his 
narration of aaron coplands a lincoln portrait 
bob bays a retired music educator said warfield is superb as 
both performer and teacher he is one of our major artists he has 
a truly magnificant voice with that wonderful warm quality that 
communicates with people 
it was in 1974 that a friend at the university of illinois 
suggested warfield for a faculty position though he never had been 
to the campus his friends recommendation and the reputation of the 
universitys music school brought him to the university to teach 
i kept my career active i wasnt giving up performing just 
adding something said warfield who scheduled classes midweek so 
he could tour and perform its been a matter of organization 
one of his students was opera star jerry hadley who studied 
oratorio with warfield in the 1970s 
i got to know him very well said hadley he told those of 
us in his first class to call him uncle bill and thats what we 
always called him 
bays said warfield always was close to his students and provided 
a role model for young black musicians more black students than 
well ever know got through the university because of bills support 
and concern said bays 
warfield was born in west helena ark the eldest of five sons 
his father moved the family to rochester ny where warfield grew 
up loving music 
he sang in the church choir as a boy soprano then studied piano 
but it was his high school music teacher who recognized his 
potential as he matured and his voice changed she encouraged him to 
enter a national music competition he won a scholarship to eastman 
where eventually he earned both a bachelors and a masters degree 
little will change when warfield officially retires from the 
university in august he will give up without much regret 
administratives chores and chairmanship of the voice program but he 
still will perform and teach 
and students likely will continue to drop into his home for 
advice and sometimes a slice of the sweet potato pie for which 
uncle bill is famous 
i love to cook thats my relaxation when im home warfield 
said and there are always a lot of students around to use as 
guinea pigs

doubts about the financial stability of donald 
trumps casino and real estate empire are growing with major banks 
seeking assurances about the developers ability to handle his 
billiondollar debt load 
investors also are growing uneasy prices for junk bonds used to 
finance trumps atlantic city casino projects plunged as much as 10 
monday 
the selloff began after the wall street journal reported trump 
has been meeting with major lenders who have grown increasingly 
uneasy about his reported 2 billion in bank debt they are seeking 
a restructuring of the developers holdings including a possible 
sale of some trump assets 
the journal said trumps lenders have grown concerned that his 
holdings including his three atlantic city casinos are not 
producing enough cash to meet payments the report said they had 
begun meeting with trump and his aides two weeks ago 
trump issued a terse but upbeat statement in response to the 
journal story confirming the talks were under way but calling them 
cooperative and constructive 
calls to trumps office were referred to his spokesman howard j 
rubenstein who refused to give any information about the 
negotiations beyond the statement 
mondays developments further eroded trumps image as a selfmade 
american success story 
in recent months the developer while maintaining he wasnt 
having cash flow problems has said he was considering putting some 
of his assets on the block including the northeast air shuttle he 
bought from eastern airlines for 365 million last year trump said 
he wanted the cash to buy new properties 
trumps assets include the plaza hotel trump tower skyscraper 
and several apartment buildings in manhattan the casinos including 
the recently opened 1 billion taj mahal trump plaza and trump 
castle and the trump shuttle 
the journal said monday that some of the planned sales had fallen 
through or put on hold for example the developers plan to sell 
his trump princess yacht for 115 million to japanese investors had 
failed the journal said quoting people familiar with the talks 
trumps lenders likely are concerned because of a downturn in the 
real estate market furthermore the taj mahal which opened two 
months ago apparently has not flourished amid the plethora of 
casinos in atlantic city 
mike mulvaney who follows the taj mahal and trump plaza casinos 
for moodys investors service said he had reports the taj mahal 
has not been operating to its fullest potential the trump plaza 
was faring somewhat better he said 
the journal reported that the big banks also were concerned that 
if trump does sell assets he might not be able to get the kind of 
prices that he claims they are worth 
in his statement monday trump continued to talk up the worth of 
his holdings they are unique well positioned and they have great 
longterm value he said 
the junk bond market was not reassured by trumps assertions 
trump taj mahal 14 percent bonds were down 10 and being quoted 
at 56 to 58 per 100 in face value in late afternoon trump plaza 
12 percent bonds meanwhile were down 4 and quoted at 8283 
while trump castle 13 percent issues were off 10 and quoted at 
5961 
a highyield bond market analyst who asked not to be identified 
said the journal article unsettled junk bond holders 
it raises a lot of doubt on how liquid the guy is and if the 
banks are going to call in their debt the analyst said 
the journal story followed a string of negative reports about how 
well trumps empire is doing forbes magazine recently sliced its 
estimate of the developers net worth to 500 million from more than 
15 billion 
trump consistently has maintained he was having no liquidity 
problems after questions were first raised about his cash flow the 
developer was so enraged that he threatened to sue newspapers if 
they reported he was strapped for cash 
rubenstein refused to discuss trumps cash situation how much 
debt he is carrying or whether he will be disposing of any assets

the united states must reduce its budget 
deficit to free up funds needed to finance sweeping economic change 
in eastern europe several former highranking government officials 
said 
a looming shortage of capital is one of the biggest threats to 
reform in the former soviet bloc and efforts to revamp the worldwide 
trading system officials said monday at an annual meeting of 
leaders of private and public banks from 22 nations 
deficit reduction is the acid test for improving the us 
position in the world economy former federal reserve chairman paul 
a volcker told the bankers gathered for the international monetary 
conference 
i submit to you that no other single measure we could take 
would be so important in supporting the potential for trade and 
development in the 1990s he said in a closeddoor address to the 
bankers according to a text of his remarks 
frankly what has concerned me the most has been the tendency 
for the united states to retreat from economic leadership in recent 
years he said 
volcker who now runs a new york investment house told reporters 
later that the united states should stop criticizing japan for its 
low consumer spending and high savings rate and instead get its own 
fiscal house in order 
nigel lawson former chancellor of the exchequer in great 
britain said there are signs that private savings worldwide are not 
matching investment needs a discrepancy that will be further 
exacerbated by the new investment opportunities now beginning to 
arise in eastern europe 
it is important that governments cease to make demands on 
private savings whether at home or overseas by running budget 
deficits he said according to a copy of his remarks lawson did 
not specifically mention the united states 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady told the bankers at an open 
session that they must help meet the funding needs of eastern europe 
as more countries embrace the principles of economic freedom 
creditors will need to stand ready to lend their support he said 
you in this room cannot simply be bystanders to this process 
but lawson said in his remarks that commercial bank lending to 
the governments of eastern europe is not the answer to those 
nations needs for capital governments for their part must 
rigorously refrain from encouraging or urging banks to make such 
loans due to their risky nature he said 
brady outlined current us efforts to help fund moves away from 
governmentowned industry both in eastern europe and south america 
he said the united states has committed nearly 1 billion over three 
years for poland and hungary and that it is the largest contributor 
to the new european bank for reconstruction and development brady 
did not call for any increases in spending to help these nations 
our challenge in the developed countries is to encourage and 
nurture these impulses for economic freedom he said but lets 
face it the world is short of capital and governments are shorter 
still 
he said the developed world also must work to maintain steady 
economic growth and open markets to make it easier for these nations 
to succeed 
volcker expressed optimism about the potential for international 
trade and development in the 1990s in light of the decline of 
communism 
after all if things go reasonably well 100 million people in 
eastern europe 300 million in russia and over a billion in china 
have the theoretical potential for growing 5 to 10 percent a year 
like the east asians in the 1980s he said 
but volcker cautioned that there are several potential pitfalls 
for that optimistic scenario including a shortage of capital and 
the possibility for trade frictions that could lead to protectionist 
policies 
if current negotiations aimed at liberalizing the global trading 
system end in disarray later this year congress may act to restrict 
imports and foreign investment he said 
that would in turn certainly reinforce those in europe who 
would like to restrict access to their markets he added 
if such trade restrictions coincided with a recession and a 
softening in the value of the dollar serious damage to the world 
economy could result volcker said

faber plc and new yorkbased corroon amp black corp will help both 
companies expand into new markets in continental europe and the 
pacific rim officials said 
the companies also said the deal would give each broker access to 
the others home market where they currently have little presence 
we have a perfect fit and the synergies will come immediately 
i believe said richard miller chairman and chief executive of 
corroon amp black 
willis faber and corroon amp black said monday they had agreed on a 
778 million stock swap that would create the worlds fourthlargest 
insurance broker the brokers link insurance underwriters with a 
broad range of clients including airlines shippers and 
manufacturers 
top executives of the two companies already are planning to shop 
for other firms in europe and the pacific to fulfill their expansion 
aims 
well be working europe together very soon miller said 
were starting to make joint efforts to attract some new players 
to this team 
its definitely a drawback if you do not have the resources in 
place where your customers have offices miller said spreading 
out internationally makes you more competitive definetely 
you have to be able to take care of your clients wherever they 
are said john vh robins executive director of willis faber 
britains secondlargest insurance broker after sedgwick group plc 
the new firm willis corroon plc would be based in britain and 
is expected to have 1990 revenue of about 1 billion the merger 
would create the worlds fourth largest insurance brokerage in terms 
of revenue marsh amp mclennan cos inc of new york is the largest 
news of the merger did not cheer investors though willis faber 
shares dropped nearly 9 percent to 265 pence the equivalent of 
443 a share on the london stock exchange corroon amp black fell 
225 to 3425 a share on the new york stock exchange 
corroon amp black stockholders would get 78 willis faber shares 
for every corroon amp black share they hold the equivalent of 3455 
a share based on mondays closing price the deal values corroon amp 
black at the equivalent of 778 million 
despite the lackluster market reaction some analysts praised the 
strategy behind the deal 
i think that some of the best opportunities for 1992 are for 
the brokers who can easily cross international lines said gloria 
vogel a stock analyst at bear stearns referring to the scheduled 
dismantling of trade barriers within europes common market 
the new company would be 60 percentowned by shareholders of the 
british group and 40 percentowned by corroon shareholders the 
companies said 
miller would be chief executive of the merged firm roger j 
elliott chairman of willis faber would be executive chairman of 
the new company 
the board of willis corroon is to have equal representation from 
the two companies 
the merger is expected to be completed by the end of september 
the proposed transaction must be approved by stockholders of both 
companies and by us and british regulators 
neither company forsaw much employee overlap in the merged 
business 
corroon amp black is the worlds sixthlargest insurance brokerage 
it also provides risk management advice reinsurance brokerage and 
other services such as health care and employee benefits 
willis faber the worlds fifthlargest brokerage handles 
insurance and reinsurance brokerage as well as risk management 
services its serves clients in the fields of aviation marine and 
energy 
corroon has nearly all its business in the united states while 
willis faber gets about 80 percent of its revenues from britain 
corroon sold its 299 percent interest in the british broker minet 
holdings plc in february 1988 
willis fabers aftertax profit rose 19 percent to 376 million 
pounds or 63 million in 1989 on a 4 percent revenue gain to 2378 
million pounds or 397 million

seven of eight divisions in federated 
department stores inc and allied stores corp showed operating 
profits in april encouraging officials who reported a 245 million 
loss overall for the month 
we continue to make progress across the business said allen 
i questrom chairman and chief executive officer of the retailers 
federated and allied filed their monthly report monday in us 
bankruptcy court where they sought chapter 11 protection in 
january the retailers said their performance was strong in april 
although the cost of servicing their big debt helped leave them with 
the 245 million loss for the month 
federated and allied are required to report monthly results to 
the bankruptcy court 
spokeswoman carol sanger said lackluster sales were expected at 
the stores immediately following the bankruptcy filing 
but it has not turned out that way she said the 
stabilization has come much farther than where we thought we would 
be at this time 
the overall april loss in the federated division was listed as 
127 million federated operates 132 lazarus bloomingdales 
abraham and strauss burdines richs and goldsmiths stores in 19 
states 
allieds loss was 118 million allied operates 128 jordan 
marsh maas brothers the bon marche and sterns stores in 17 states 
the court filing said federated had an operating profit of 112 
million for the month and allied recorded operating profits of 79 
million those figures dont take into account the retailers debt 
servicing costs 
for april federated listed interest expense of 245 million 
and allied listed 167 million 
federated and allied executives have maintained that their 
divisions and store chains are strong and could be profitable if 
they were not saddled with so much debt most of it stemming from 
the takeovers of the retailers by canadian real estate tycoon robert 
campeau 
ms sanger said management was encouraged by marchapril sales 
and earnings and that the period marked a continuing stabilization 
of the business in the postchapter 11 filing period 
sales and earnings in the combined marchapril period were 
consistent with managements expectations she said moreover 
both federated and allied posted operating gains in april for the 
second straight month 
sales of soft goods increased in april continuing march trends 
in such merchandise as womens sportswear coats shoes and 
cosmetics ms sanger said 
key performance indicators in the marchapril period showed 
encouraging trends and i think any weakness in the business that we 
currently are experiencing is related more to the general retail 
climate than to federated and allied in particular questrom said 
also monday the retailers told the bankruptcy court that theyve 
received their first legal bill from the chapter 11 filing the 
cleveland legal firm of jones day reavis amp pogue asked for 
compensation for 243 million in legal fees and 437125 in 
expenses

putting the sometimes mindboggling technological 
capabilities of computers into easytouse packages is the 
industrys major challenge executives said at a convention 
our successors in the year 2000 should judge us not only on 
the technology we brought to the market but on how we used that 
technology to bring the world closer together said bob kavner 
who manages data systems and federal systems for the atampt group 
kavner sounded the call for simplification in his speech opening 
comdexspring 90 on monday the industrys biannual gathering is 
expected to draw 60000 through wednesday 
that sentiment was echoed on the exhibit floor 
no matter how advanced the technology if people dont turn it 
on it does no good said william roberts a sales representative 
for caseworks inc 
caseworks an atlantabased software developer is one of several 
companies at the show that have enthusiastically endorsed windows 
30 a software product introduced last month by microsoft corp to 
make ibm personal computers easier to use 
either people will get on this bandwagon or get left behind 
very quickly roberts said 
pat kenealy publisher of pc world magazine said windows was one 
of the key software technologies getting a close look the 
convention marks the first time many in the industry have been able 
to see the new version of windows he said 
windows was designed to make ibm personal computers and their 
clones as easy to use as apple computers macintosh 
over the last three or four years ibms standard computers have 
been tons cheaper than macintosh but much harder to use macintosh 
is massively more userfriendly but massively more expensive 
kenealy said 
caseworks latest product the casew engineering tool was 
unveiled on the heels of the windows introduction and prominently 
features the new software 
roberts said caseworks is pushing windows technology as a way for 
companies to get more production out of their workers by simplifying 
computers with windows a user with only limited computer knowledge 
can perform up to four times as many functions as before he said 
it makes the computer less intimidating he said 
the emergence of computer networks which link computer users and 
allow increased sharing of information was evident on the comdex 
floor as exhibitors jostled to get attention for hundreds of 
products aimed at offering heightened compatibility 
drawing a sizeable crowd was a demonstration of wangs profound 
document manager which the company says provides access to 
documents anywhere on a large busy network 
the user in a big corporation for example can find a document 
with a search based on the content of the paper rather than worrying 
about where it was filed said christopher junker a regional 
manager for wang

soviet officials and securities analysts 
said a chevron corp agreement to study the feasibility of 
developing the soviet unions vast tengiz oil field holds great 
potential 
this is the kind of asset that if opened up to the west could 
be very significant warren m shimmerlik an oil analyst for 
county natwest usa said monday 
chevron signed an agreement over the weekend with the soviet 
ministry of oil and gas industry to study the field with reserves 
estimated at more than 25 billion barrels about 2 times those of 
alaskas prudhoe bay 
the protocol of intentions is just the first step toward a 
joint venture to actually tap the oil long negotiations are 
expected and the tangled soviet bureaucracy could complicate the 
matter even if extraction is possible 
eugene nowak an oil analyst at dean witter reynolds inc said 
developing the field near the caspian sea appears to be a tough 
nut i can imagine the soviets are going to need some help on this 
but he said it appeared to be nothing that chevron perhaps 
working with parker drilling of tulsa okla couldnt handle 
technically 
the uncertainty is that this is a new venture for the soviets 
and its the business side thats questionable rather than the 
technical side nowak said 
however soviet oil and gas minister leonid filimonov predicted 
monday that a deal to tap the oil field will be signed in the near 
future 
speaking at a meeting of the american association of petroleum 
geologists he said the proposed partnership will be a guarantee 
of further development of sovietamerican business ties 
the soviets appear highly motivated to ensure that this and 
similar projects take place 
the soviet union is the worlds biggest oil producer but 
production has fallen off in recent years and us technology and 
capital are gravely needed to reverse that trend shimmerlik said 
however he said extraction of the oil appears years away and 
while chevron may expect a profit its unlikely to get a windfall 
nowak said there appears to be no way chevron can lose on the 
deal the worst that could happen is that the venture falls through

eastman kodak co hopes expanded business 
relations with the soviet union will allow the photographic giant 
eventually to open its familiar photo processing laboratories and 
photo stores in five soviet cities 
the rochesterbased company is one of six companies in the 
american trade consortium which is seeking increased trade with the 
soviet union 
as part of the consortium kodak hopes to start joint ventures 
with the soviet government for making blood analyzers in leningrad 
xray equipment in kiev and inkjet printers in kursk and for 
distribution of consumer photo products in leningrad according to 
david harari kodaks general manager for eastern europe 
kodak spokesman paul c allen said monday that kodak still has no 
goahead from the soviet government on its proposed joint ventures 
in the soviet union 
but allen said kodak is encouraged by the signing of the new 
agreement saturday by the consortium and the soviet foreign economic 
consortium 
the new agreement calls for chevron corp an atc member and 
tengizneftegaz a soviet oil company to study the possibility of 
jointly developing the massive tengiz oil field in the kazakh soviet 
republic in central asia 
because all the oil would be exported it would generate earnings 
in hard currencies us dollars japanese yen and other 
currencies accepted in international trade which kodak and other 
atc members could swap for soft soviet rubles earned in their 
ventures 
other atc members are johnson amp johnson archer daniels midland 
co rjr nabisco inc and mercator corp an investment bank 
in addition to the chevron deal the atcsoviet agreement defines 
a new accelerated economic development program which calls for 
additional joint ventures to produce consumer goods medical 
equipment and other products 
the atcsoviet agreement reprepesents a strong commitment of 
american business to participate in the restructuring and 
development of the soviet economy atc president james giffen said

officials from the united states and 16 of its 
allies will meet wednesday to discuss the easing of controls on 
hightechnology exports to eastern bloc countries 
formed in 1949 at the start of the cold war the coordinating 
committee for multilateral export controls has served as a watchdog 
agency limiting the shipment of strategic technology to warsaw pact 
nations 
known as cocom the committee is made up of all nato member 
counties except iceland plus japan and australia 
at the twoday meeting officials of the 17 countries are 
expected to approve a relaxation of controls on exports of 
telecommunications equipment computers and machine tools 
in the past the united states has been more reluctant than most 
of the other members to ease controls but at a cocom executive 
committee meeting in february following the developments in 
eastern europe us officials said they would support total or 
partial relaxations of curbs on more than 40 of the 120 regulated

saatchi amp saatchi co plc on tuesday posted a loss 
of 77 million for the first six months of the year and announced 
it had agreed to sell its largest consulting firm the hay group 
for about 81 million 
the troubled advertising and communications group blamed the 
latest loss on disappointing consulting revenues the company had 
earned 168 million in the same period a year ago 
saatchi said it had agreed to sell hay to 135 members of hays 
management and institutional investors led by cin venture managers 
ltd of britain 
hay based in philadelphia and acquired by the saatchi for 100 
million in 1984 specializes in employee compensation it employs 
more than 2000 people in 81 offices in 29 countries and has 9000 
clients worldwide 
under terms of ths sale saatchi would receive 80 million in 
cash and a 10 million 10year subordinated note paying 10 percent 
interest but saatchi also has agreed to pay expenses incurred by 
the buyers of up to 9 million 
saatchi has been seeking for months to sell off hay and five 
other major consulting businesses to focus on its advertising 
operations said a saatchi spokesman 
the hay sale is the first major disposal since it put its 
consulting businesses up for sale and saathci said the offer from 
hay management was the only firm bid the agency received 
saatchis sales for the six months ended march 31 rose 18 percent 
to 408 billion from 35 billion its pretax profit fell 29 
percent to 242 million 339 million 
saatchi has been suffering from high costs slower advertising 
growth in general and its unsuccessful diversification into 
consulting 
in its latest announcement the company said it would pay no 
dividend for the period compared with a dividend of 124 cents a 
share paid a year ago 
it posted a net loss of 98 million for its fiscal year ended 
sept 30 
revenue in the companys communications division which include 
its ad agencies rose 17 percent in the first half to 655 million 
but the company noted that the figures were enhanced by favorable 
currency movements and the transfer of market research activities to 
the communications division excludig those factors it said revenue 
growth was about 7 percent 
the divisions profit before taxes and other items rose 40 
percent to 52 million buoyed by relatively solid performance in 
the united states and europe 
however the company said that the british performance in the 
communications sector was disappointing it said although its client 
base continues to grow some clients were reducing spending 
despite our strong new business performance revenue growth 
will be muted the company warned we expect the secondhalf 
communications profit performance to be at least as good as the 
first half 
consulting revenues slid 3 percent to 193 million the 
operations had a loss before taxes and other items of 12 million 
compared with a profit of 134 million a year earlier 
the consulting profits were hurt by the companys decision last 
year to sell its consulting businesses the company said it said 
negotiations on the disposal of its remaining consulting operations 
continue 
the figures were converted at the current exchange rate of 168 
to the pound

royal canadian mounted police 
acting on a court order moved striking british columbia truckers 
away from a us border crossing south of vancouver today 
truckers at the pacific highway crossing jeered police but there 
was no violence said sgt peter montague 
bob jones western owner operators association spokesman said 
the drivers were served with an injunction shortly before midnight 
monday night and they felt they had complied with the order by 
allowing all truck traffic to proceed he said but by daybreak 
officers ordered them to leave the crossing 
they told them either to move or get arrested if we dont 
move we would get hurt real bad jones said 
by midmorning none of the blockading rigs remained at white 
rock british columbia the town opposite blaine wash traffic was 
flowing smoothly through the border crossing though canadian 
customs was kept busy processing a backlog of more than 100 trucks 
that had been stuck on the us side 
everythings moving again said gr greig a canadian 
customs official 
truckers remained at three other crossings 
the proposed settlement covering 60 of 180 trucking companies 
involved in the dispute was announced monday by bryan williams the 
strikes chief mediator for the government of british columbia 
some of the 3000 independent truckers vowed to continue the 
strike they began may 27 if their demands werent met 
the blockades since friday have halted most commercial traffic 
across the canadian border between washington and british columbia 
similar blockades last month caused millions of dollars in losses in 
eastern canada 
williams did not disclose terms of mondays agreement but bruce 
butler a member of the western owner operators association which 
represents the independent drivers told the seattle 
postintelligencer it would boost hauling rates to 35 an hour 
canadian or 5 less than the strikers sought 
butler predicted the offer would be rejected in a vote tonight by 
the truckers 
weve been instructed by our executive board to lift the 
blockade but our agreement at the time was supposed to be for 40 
an hour now they want us to go for 35 and were saying no 
butler said were tired of starving to death 
other truckers also were upset by unofficial reports on the 
agreement 
i think weve got to stick to our guns here said trucker 
jeffrey snowden of victoria 
the 40 per hour rate was nonnegotiable said doug neal a 
spokesman for striking truckers north of this border town if we 
dont get it were going to stay here until we do 
trucks carrying fruit vegetables and other perishables had 
temporarily been allowed through the blockades but all produce 
trucks were blocked monday night said dan murray a canada customs 
superintendent at one border stop 
passenger cars buses and trucks carrying medical supplies and 
mail have been allowed unrestricted passage throughout the dispute 
blockades at four border points and along two major canadian 
highways began in earnest friday 
the strike also has drawn support from the teamsters union 
the blockades have resulted in food and fuel shortages in the 
province and in point roberts a small washington state peninsula 
that is accessible overland only through british columbia they also 
forced a burnaby british columbia truck manufacturer to shut down 
monday for lack of parts from the united states

ernest saunders the former chairman of guinness 
plc took the witness stand tuesday as the defense began its case in 
the first of two trials resulting from the giant brewers 1986 
takeover of distillers co 
saunders lawyer richard ferguson described his client as the 
victim in britains largest whitecollar scandal he said the 
prosecutions case against saunders was weak and attempted to 
substitute quantity for quality 
the jury trial which began feb 16 entered its 63rd day 
tuesday saunders and six other defendants are accused of being 
involved in a scheme to arrange for the purchase of guinness stock 
during the takeover fight for distillers a scotch whisky and gin 
maker 
the aim of the alleged conspiracy was to boost the price of 
guinness stock and thus make the companys 42 billion cash and 
stock bid more attractive than a rival offer from supermarket 
operator argyll group plc 
the takeover succeeded in april 1986 but in december of that 
year the department of trade and industry announced it was 
investigating and the alleged financial wrongdoings became public 
the imperative of course is to find a scapegoat ferguson 
told the court something has gone wrong with this great company 
someone has to carry the can 
ferguson said saunders who had to obtain legal aid to cover his 
huge legal fees was testifying voluntarily under british law he 
is not required to give evidence on his own behalf 
i could say to you that whatever happens he is a ruined man 
stripped of the means of earning his livelihood his personal life 
in ruins and himself undermined cast aside we would say by the 
company he served loyally for five years ferguson said 
but he still has something to fight for and that is his 
credibility 
saunders wearing a navyblue doublebreasted suit began his 
evidence by giving details of treatment he was having for two 
medical complaints a hernia and a thyroid gland problem he said he 
has separated from his wife and she has moved abroad 
standing trial with the 54yearold saunders are gerald ronson 
51 chairman of heron international plc former stockbroker anthony 
parnes 44 and millionaire financier sir jack lyons 74 
they face a total of 35 charges including stock manipulation 
theft false accounting and destroying documents 
saunders faces two charges of conspiring to contravene the 
prevention of fraud investments act two charges of authorizing or 
permitting guinness to contravene the companies act eight charges 
of false accounting two charges of theft and one charge of 
destroying company documents 
in the second trial scheduled to begin sometime after october 
the defendants will be roger seelig 44 former morgan grenfell amp 
co ltd corporate finance director lord patrick spens 47 former 
director of corporate finance at the merchant bank henry ansbacher amp 
co ltd and david mayhew 48 senior corporate finance partner of 
the investment firm cazenove amp co 
the seven men have pleaded innocent to the charges and each is 
free on the equivalent of 835000 in bail 
us lawyer thomas ward has been charged in connection with the 
affair and british police are seeking his extradition ward has 
denied wrongdoing

paramount communications inc said tuesday its 
profit fell 677 percent in its second fiscal quarter from results a 
year ago that included a big contribution from a financial services 
company that has since been sold 
paramount said its results from publishing and entertainment were 
within expectations and said it was still on track to achieve its 
previously announced forecast of earnings for the fiscal year of 
210 to 260 a share 
the company said it earned 212 million or 18 cents per share 
for the three months ended april 30 compared with earnings of 656 
million or 55 cents a share a year earlier 
lasts year results included 709 million or 60 cents per 
share in earnings from discontinued operations mainly from the 
associates the financial services subsidiary that paramount sold to 
ford motor co in october 
without that contribution paramount lost 53 million from 
continuing operations a year ago 
revenue rose 162 percent to 812 million from 699 million a 
year earlier 
the latest results included 218 million in net interest income 
resulting primarily from the investment of the proceeds from the 
sale of the associates the sale price was 335 billion 
the company said it had significant operating income from 
entertainment operations although the results fell short of the 
record performance a year earlier 
motion picture results were also below last years results 
despite a strong performance by the hunt for red october and the 
foreign theatrical popularity of black rain pet sematary 
and shirley valentine 
operating income from television operations approximated the 
results of a year ago paced by the success of the arsenio hall 
show and entertainment tonight and higher syndication revenue 
from cheers 
publishing operations results were in line with those of a year 
ago publishing traditionally posts a loss in the quarter as a 
result of the seasonality of educational publishing 
for the first six months of the year paramount earned 424 
million or 35 cents a share down 685 percent from 1348 million 
or 113 a share a year earlier

fears that creditors would begin repossessing buses 
and closing off terminals led strikebound greyhound lines inc to 
seek protection in federal bankruptcy court the company says 
the only nationwide bus system filed for chapter 11 protection 
from its creditors monday the move allows greyhound to continue 
operating under court supervision while it tries to reorganize its 
finances 
a hearing has been set for thursday at 9 am before us 
bankruptcy judge richard schmidt in brownsville 
there will be no interruption of service senior vice 
president j michael doyle said 
the dallasbased company has seen ridership and revenues plunge 
after most of its 6300 drivers walked out march 2 in a dispute over 
wages and job security 
meanwhile arizonabased greyhound dial corp which leases some 
buses and facilities to the bus company said today it is charging 
100 million against aftertax earnings to establish a reserve for 
possible losses related to greyhound lines 
the company said the actual amount of the loss will be determined 
by developments including the bankruptcy proceedings and results of 
ongoing business operations 
the bankruptcy filing action is a positive stabilizing move 
which should help solidify the troubled position of greyhound lines 
and go a long way to ensuring the longterm survival of the bus 
lines john w teets greyhound dials president and chief 
executive officer said in a statement 
greyhound dial sold the bus lines in 1987 for more than 350 
million but still holds preferred stock and notes from greyhound 
lines 
striking drivers who maintained that greyhound lines had tried 
to bust the union at the expense of the companys economic health 
said picketing will continue into the chapter 11 reorganization 
were not surprised about the filing because weve been 
expecting it all along said gary h daughrity executive board 
member of local 1313 amalgamated council of greyhound local unions 
in dallas 
a lot of us cant figure out why it took so long for greyhound 
to seek bankruptcy court protection 
one reason that greyhounds financial woes worsened was that 
fewer striking drivers crossed picket lines than company management 
had anticipated daughrity said 
the company has hired about 3000 replacement drivers and claims 
to have restored service to locations that provided 98 percent of 
revenues last year 
but the drop in ridership and the cost of fighting the sometimes 
violent strike drained the companys cash including a strike fund 
estimated at more than 54 million 
greyhound blamed the strike for much of its 56 million 
firstquarter loss the company also has missed more than 17 
million in interest lease and principal payments putting it in 
default on many financial agreements 
in the past few days there has been a lot of pressure by 
creditors who own buses and terminals and lease them to greyhound 
said president frank schmieder 
under the lease agreements those owners can repossess buses 
immediately after a missed payment spokesman george gravley said 
the company was concerned about possible action by owners of leases 
on 500 to 1000 of the companys 3800 buses 
while most creditors have been cooperative we were faced 
with the threat of a run on assets that would have crippled our 
ability to operate doyle said 
greyhound filed its petition in us bankruptcy court in 
brownsville the filing also includes five affiliated companies 
eagle bus manufacturing co gli bus operations holding co 
buslease inc trailways commuter transit inc and gli food services 
inc greyhounds parent gli holding co was not included 
greyhound has reported scores of shootings bomb threats and 
incidents of vandalism since the strike began a striking driver in 
redding calif was killed on the second day of the walkout after 
being crushed by a bus driven by a replacement 
talks stalled under the companys demand that a week pass without 
violence first the two sides did meet on may 5 but the union 
balked at greyhounds insistence on retaining its newly hired 
drivers and changing from a mileagebased to an hourly wage scale 
on may 7 chairman fred g currey said the strike had become 
irrelevant because the carrier had enough drivers to operate 
two weeks later however the company proposed repurchasing 225 
million of its junk bonds at a steep discount to avert bankruptcy 
schmieder said negotiations are continuing on a debt buyback but 
it will take longer now because the courts will have to approve 
any financial restructuring 
the companys total debt stood at 384 million at the end of 
march the debt is the legacy of a 270 million leveraged buyout led 
by currey three years ago that took the company private a few 
months later the group paid 80 million for dallasbased trailways 
lines inc

coors brewing co has forged a deal with stroh 
brewery co to purchase strohs memphis tenn facility an 
aquisition marking the first time coors will make beer outside of 
golden co officials said tuesday 
the companies said they hoped to complete the transaction by july 
3 but stroh said it would operate the 500employee breery until 
sept 1 the brewery sale price was not disclosed 
this purchase is part of our overall strategy to position coors 
brewing co for future growth said peter coors president of 
goldenbased coors brewing it will provide the additional 
capacity we need to respond to rising consumer demand for our 
products 
coors brewing co earlier reported shipping a record 39 million 
barrels of beer during the first quarter of this year when it also 
reported record net sales of 394 million the memphis brewery with 
an annual brewing capacity of 55 million barrels will increase 
coors annual production by nearly a third 
adolph coors co the parent company of coors brewing founded in 
1873 by german immigrant adolph coors this year surpassed 
detroitbased stroh as the nations no 3 brewer with a 9 percent 
market share 
anheuserbusch with its 42 percent share and miller brewing co 
with its 22 percent share were the top brewers 
coors last year produced 177 million barrels of beer the 
company ships some to its satellite packaging facility in elkton 
va which has a packaging capacity of 25 million barrels 
the announcement comes less than a week after anheuserbusch 
accused coors of engaging in false and deceptive advertising by 
implying that its products contain only rocky mountain spring 
water anheuserbusch complained to the federal trade commission 
that coors ships beer concentrates to its elkton facility where 
local water is added 
coors replied that 14 percent of its beer was shipped last year 
as concentrate to elkton where water and carbonation were added 
before packaging but the company said all its beer is brewed with 
rocky mountain spring water 
coors will assume strohs collective bargaining agreement with 
the memphis brewerys hourly employees when it takes over salaried 
employees will be notified later about employment opportunities with 
coors stroh said tuesday 
coors brewing spokeswoman carey baird said the company would not 
discuss plans for the memphis brewery until the transaction was 
completed 
the memphis brewery is one of six owned and operated by stroh 
the breweries employ about 4500 workers and have a total capacity 
of about 24 million barrels a year 
stroh began looking for partners in february 1989 amid financial 
struggles that resulted in more than 300 layoffs and sales of some 
properties and divisions including an icecream business 
stroh agreed to sell most of its beer business to coors for 425 
million last fall but the agreement fell apart in december 
officials of both companies have refused to discuss details of 
the failed buyout such as whether the price or antitrust 
considerations were stumbling blocks 
neither baird nor stroh spokeswoman lacey logan would comment on 
whether the current deal indicated the companies were conducting 
further negotiations stroh president roger fridholm indicated in 
may that stroh was attempting to position itself to continue 
independent operation 
peter stroh stroh chairman and chief executive officer said 
selling the memphis brewery will permit us to effectively 
consolidate our production into our remaining five breweries 
peter coors said the memphis plant is strategically located 
and it has a solid infrastructure and work force in place that 
makes it an excellent fit for us

stock prices fell today countering a recent 
rally that produced record highs 
analysts attributed the decline to scattered selling to take 
profits after a runup in the dow jones industrial average of more 
than 10 percent since late april 
a sharp drop in crude oil prices and a weaker bond market 
contributed to the selloff bond prices rose sharply and interest 
rates declined good for stocks in a rally late last week 
declines in several major oil and oilfield industry stocks 
because of lower oil prices offset gains in financial issues 
airlines benefitting from the potential for cheaper jet fuel also 
fared well 
but some market players predicted that the decline was just a 
pause before a further jump 
money managers with large cash reserves when the market began 
moving upward have bought stock in recent days boosting the market 
to its new highs that enthusiasm was not seen as waning today

energy futures prices fell sharply tuesday on the new york 
mercantile exchange on reports that saudi arabia is selling crude 
oil at discount prices to its major customers 
on other markets grain and soybean futures were mostly higher 
precious metals climbed copper rallied and livestock and pork 
futures rose sharply 
analysts said saudi arabia may be selling crude at a discount 
because of its displeasure with opecs failure to be faithful to 
production quotas 
according to randolph donney a research analyst with merrill 
lynch in new york the saudis are discounting as much as 75 cents a 
barrel he says it appears they are willing to let the price to dip 
below 15 a barrel 
that will stun a number of countries who depend on oil to keep 
their economies afloat donney said 
last month members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries agreed to reduce crude oil output to just over 22 million 
barrels a day donney said the 13 opec countries are currently 
producing 235 million barrels per day 
once again gasoline futures were battered a bad sign for the 
market because gasoline usually leads the market at this time of 
year donney said adding that the driving season got underway with 
the memorial day weekend which usually triggers higher gasoline 
prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 14 cents to 49 cents lower 
with july at 1668 a barrel heating oil was 48 cent to 76 cent 
lower with july at 4711 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 90 
cent to 176 cents lower with july at 5782 cents a gallon

chicago board of trade with corn futures sharply higher as planting 
continues to lag 
the us department of agriculture issued a report at the close 
of trading monday that said planting of the corn crop was 88 percent 
complete as of sunday that is less than expected taking into 
account that there were several days of clear weather last week 
said joel karlin an analyst with research department inc in 
chicago 
soggy fields in recent weeks delayed the planting of corn in 
several midwestern states 
also helping corn prices was the usdas export inspection report 
which showed a pickup in demand for the grain 
wheat futures were higher on indications the peoples republic of 
china will bid for 500000 metic tons of wheat under the export 
bonus program the usda on tuesday accepted a bid for bonus wheat

bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with july at 146 a 
bushel and soybeans were a cents lower to 1 cents higher with 
july at 592 cents a bushel 
precious metals were higher in trading on the new york commodity 
exchange 
the rally in precious metals was paced by platinum which rose on 
reports of heavy buying by the japanese said bette raptopoulos an 
analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
gold futures rose as the dollar weakened against major foreign 
currencies which also helped silver prices 
gold was 120 to 130 higher with june at 35980 a troy ounce 
silver was 14 cents to 16 cents higher with june at 5065 a troy 
ounce platinum was 550 to 580 higher with june at 49180 a 
troy ounce 
copper prices were higher on the comex as demand for june copper 
spurred a sharp rally 
there was no news to account for the sharp rise in copper prices 
but there is the perception that nearterm supplies are tight ms 
raptopoulos said 
copper was 130 cents to 290 cents higher with june at 1171 a 
pound 
livestock and pork futures were higher on the chicago mercantile 
exchange with pork belly futures up the daily trading limit on news

federal railroad administrator gilbert e 
carmichael announced his support tuesday for a 25 million bid by 
canadian pacific ltd to buy the ailing delaware amp hudson railway 
canadian pacific railroad and the damph is more than just saving 
1600 miles of track it creates another major eastern usa north 
american railroad for the western railroads to do business with 
carmichael said at a news conference in the office of sen alfonse 
damato rny 
damato who also endorsed canadian pacifics bid said the 
justice department would file a supporting brief at a damph hearing 
thursday in us bankruptcy court in wilmington del 
with the federal government asking the court to approve the 
sale we have cleared another major hurdle to save the damph 
damato said 
the federal railroad administrator is damphs largest creditor 
with more than 90 million in secured claims 
last month the damphs bankruptcy trustee accepted canadian 
pacifics bid which also promises about 5 million for the trustee 
if canadian pacific can sell rights to run fiber optic 
communications cables along the damph rightofway 
the deal is contingent on agreements by the damphs 14 unions with 
the canadian pacific before midjuly 
damato said tuesday that tentative accords had been reached with 
all the unions but canadian pacific spokesman john cox said the 
senator was mistaken the only tentative agreement was with the 
united transportation union the largest of the group cox said 
he declined to divulge details of the accord until the rank and 
file vote on it later this week 
cox also hesitated when asked whether federal support for 
canadian pacifics bid might sway judge balick 
i would not like to be in a position of suggesting what will 
make up the judges mind for her he said adding that she must 
be aware of the public support for canadian pacifics bid 
canadian pacifics 25 million bid is 10 million less than it 
had offered earlier this year canadian pacific withdrew it in 
february after the carrier was unable to secure trackage rights 
between hagerstown md and harrisburg pa those tracks belong to 
consolidated rail corp which refused to negotiate 
the new offer is for rolling stock 600 miles of damphowned track 
and running rights over 900 miles of track of other lines canadian 
pacific owns about 14000 miles of track in canada and 5000 in the 
united states 
the damph the nations oldest continually operated railroad filed 
in june 1988 for protection from its creditors the railroad runs 
from montreal to washington dc and from albany to buffalo ny

bankers are paying more attention to the 
impact of environmental concerns on their industry and on business 
in general participants in a worldwide banking convention said 
tuesday 
when banks are asked to finance a factory or other industrial 
operation they increasingly explore the potential environmental 
impact of the project before giving approval said r donald 
fullerton chairman and chief executive of canadian imperial bank of 
commerce 
were in an early learning process he told reporters at the 
international monetary conference we are paying more attention to 
the kinds of projects we are financing for potential environmental 
impact he said fullerton called such concern a reasonably new 
development 
another concern for banks is the environmental impact of their 
own operations said fullerton who was chairman of a panel on the 
environment at the annual banking convention 
we have a massive papergenerating machine that we need to deal 
with he said without offering a solution 
fullerton said the bankers at the closeddoor meetings agreed 
that the environment was a major issue that the banking community 
will have to pay attention to 
for industry in general the environmental aspects have become 
a new bottom line said one of the panelists alex krauer 
chairman and managing director of cibageigy ltd of basel 
switzerland 
we are part of the problem but also want to be part of the 
solution krauer told reporters 
at their private session the bankers heard an address by frank 
press president of the national academy of sciences who said he 
believes business executives are genuinely concerned about the 
impact of their operations on the environment according to a text 
of his speech 
i dont think i am being unfair if i observe that 20 years ago 
many companies treated environmental concerns as something to 
ignore deflect or fight he said today their perceptions and 
actions have changed greatly

transportation and us bankruptcy court in new york eastern filed 
for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection shortly after a strike by 
machinists pilots and flight attendants in march 1989 
martin shugrue the courtappointed trustee overseeing eastern

joblessness tripled in east germany in just 
six weeks and the government worried about mass unrest unveiled a 
broad program tuesday to blunt the shock of the shift to a free 
market 
east german factories will cut hours and reduce wages to try to 
keep people on the payroll even though there is less work for them 
to do said labor and social minister regine hildebrandt 
a new employment administration has been created to oversee a 
program for compensating workers for lost wages and retraining them 
for new jobs she said 
east germany is to officially shed four decades of socialism july 
2 and merge its economy and social institutions with west germany 
it will be the biggest and most difficult stage of full german 
unification 
the effects of unification already are being felt in the form of 
rising prices and growing unemployment as east german enterprises 
many of them inefficient and overstaffed face western competition 
about 100000 people were officially unemployed at the end of 
may said mrs hildebrandt that represents only 1 percent of the 
work force but it is about three times the ated mike easley 
the brunswick county district attorney in the runoff for the 
democratic nomination and will face gop sen jesse helms

drexel burnham lambert group inc will present 
creditors with a reorganization plan that will pay them 100 cents 
for every dollar owed a newspaper reported 
the proposal is expected to be announced wednesday afternoon at a 
meeting between the creditors and drexels law firm weil gotshal amp 
manges the new york times said in an early edition of wednesdays 
paper 
it will begin the process of formulating a reorganization plan 
with all of drexels constituents said alan b miller drexels 
lead bankruptcy lawyer 
the courtappointed creditors committee is expected to meet on 
thursday to respond to drexels plan the newspaper said 
weil gotshal lawyers already have told some creditors that 
drexel would seek to repay them through a new company that would 
hold drexels portfolio of junk bonds bridge loans and other 
securities the paper said 
a representative of one creditor said drexel valued its holdings 
at about 2 billion but cant sell most of the assets readily 
because of their poor quality and the weak state of the junk bond 
market the times said 
as a result the company will propose creating a new entity to 
issue notes to creditors and pay down those notes as the bonds and 
other investments are sold the newspaper said 
creditors representatives said a critical stumbling block to 
drexels plans would be the guarantees the firm can make about the 
value of its investments the times said 
the reorganization proposal will cover all drexel bankruptcy 
filings including last weeks chapter 11 filing of the companys 
investment banking arm drexel burnham lambert inc 
the holding company filed for chapter 11 in february because of a 
liquidity crisis brought on by its holdings of junk bonds and other 
investments
