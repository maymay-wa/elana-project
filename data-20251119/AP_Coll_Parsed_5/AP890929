iran blamed iraq friday for the stalemate 
in their yearold peace talks and said if iraq does not withdraw 
from captured territory within a reasonable time tehran must 
consider other forceful action 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati told the un 
general assembly that after more than one year and 15 rounds of 
unsponsored talks virtually no progress has been made since 
establishment of a ceasefire 
he called on the international community and the security 
council to put pressure on iraq to withdraw immediately to 
international borders and release all prisoners of war as demanded 
in a security council resolution iran he said is ready to comply 
fully with all obligations 
iraq in turn has repeatedly accused iran of bogging down peace 
talks at a summit conference of the nonaligned movement in 
belgrade yugoslavia on sept 5 iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
charged in remarks made to reporters that iran rejects peace talks 
with iraq 
the security council on friday renewed the mandate of the un 
peacekeeping group in iran and iraq for six more months and called 
upon both countries to implement the councils peace plan 
iraq has refused to take the very first step in fulfillment of 
its obligations namely withdrawal from the territory of 
iran velayati said iraq has tried to take advantage of 
illegal occupation of the territory of iran for realization of 
illegitimate and expansionist ambitions for which it launched a war 
of aggression 
he said that iraq must realize that peace is to the benefit of 
the two countries and the region continuation of the present 
nopeacenowar situation can gradually move the region toward 
resumption of tension velayati said 
he said iran welcomes the forthcoming visit of special un 
envoy jan elliason un ambassador of sweden to both capitals and 
will continue to cooperate with the un secretarygeneral 
but if these efforts do not lead within a reasonable time to a 
change in iraqs stance other measures must be contemplated 
velayati said 
earlier friday he told a news conference that iran would use 
force to recapture its territory if iraq does not withdraw he was 
repeating a statement by iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
several weeks ago 
in his speech friday velayati also condemned iraqs use of 
chemical weapons in their war and said any international ban on 
such weapons as proposed by the united states and others must 
include strong punitive measures 
earlier friday velayati said his government was ready to help 
seek the release of us and other hostages in lebanon if the 
united states releases billions of dollars of iranian assets frozen 
since the storming of the us embassy in tehran by iranian 
radicals in 1979 
if we can do anything to help any country win release of its 
hostages we do not hesitate velayati said in answer to a 
question but i hope the united states also will take some 
measures in releasing our frozen assets 
velayati asked about the relationship between hostages and 
assets said it is not our duty to talk about hostages who are 
kept in lebanon which is another country some countries ask us to 
help about hostages and that is based on reciprocity 
sixteen foreign hostages including eight americans are being 
held in lebanon by proiranian islamic fundamentalist groups and 
iran is believed to wield influence with them longest held is 
terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press who was abducted 4 years ago 
velayati emphasized the new iranian government believed more 
pragmatic and intent on economic reconstruction is against any 
hostagetaking and holding innocent persons hostage for several 
years he said iran has exerted considerable effort to help some 
countries with hostages in lebanon 
velayati asked about prospects for better relations with the 
united states said that from the beginning of the iranian 
revolution in the late 1970s the united states has had hostility 
against us and still continues the same policies

the arizona supreme court on friday rejected 
former gov evan mechams lawsuit seeking reinstatement and more 
than 600000 in back pay and expenses 
the court said it no power to overrule the state senate which 
removed the firstterm republican from office last year when it 
convicted him on civil impeachment charges he misused money in a 
state protocol fund and tried to obstruct an investigation 
mecham told a news conference the decision invited legislative 
anarchy he said he might appeal to federal courts but only if he 
could raise 150000 otherwise he said hell take his case back 
to the people in running again for governor next year 
justice in arizona today can only be found with the people at 
large certainly not with the justice system he said adding 
this is a war not a battle 
some of the money issues raised in mechams state supreme court 
case are also the subject of a lower court lawsuit and the 
justices said mecham could continue to pursue them there or in the 
legislature which can authorize payments itself 
his lawyer argued that the protocol fund statute was drafted 
unconstitutionally and that senators were allowed to vote on the 
charges without having heard all the evidence or agreeing on what 
the exact charges were 
but the justices said the senate was free to impeach mecham for 
his general course of conduct whether or not the conduct violated 
any particular statute and whether or not the statute was 
unconstitutional 
because impeachment trials are political in nature courts have 
no right to interfere as long as lawmakers follow the few rules for 
impeachment set forth in the arizona constitution they added 
aides to democratic gov rose mofford the elected secretary of 
state who assumed office after mechams ouster on april l4 1988

six months of syrian shellings have 
killed millions of fish in the mediterranean off this christian 
enclave near beirut and threatened one of lebanons few natural 
resources a government ecologist says 
the shellings stopped with the recent ceasefire in the battle 
for beirut but damage to the fish population and the livelihoods of 
local fishermen remain critical 
our sea is dying ecologist pierre malichev of the health 
ministry said in an interview its become rotten and polluted 
our marine life is nearing its end and we have no fish for next 
year 
he estimated that along with the millions of fish killed 
billions of their eggs also perished 
malichev said fish not killed by the hundreds of exploding 130mm 
howitzer shells and salvoes of rockets were poisoned by tetryl one 
of the explosive elements in the shells that is released into the 
water 
the shellings also forced most of the enclaves 500 fishermen to 
remain ashore 
but about 75 of them risked going out after dark to gather the 
thousands of fish that would float up dead on the surface after 
each shelling 
after a heavy round of shelling the dead fish float like a 
carpet on the surface fishermen sirop ornakian said before the 
ceasefire took effect 
we usually wait a bit and then head for the carpet most times 
i collect about 25 kilograms 55 pounds of fish every trip 
the syrians shelled the 28mile coastal enclave and its waters 
to keep cargo ships and tankers from running a blockade with 
supplies for the christian forces of gen michel aoun in the battle 
of beirut 
the shelling has killed our season said kivork manoukian a 
fisherman for more than 40 years usually this time of the year 
is the best for us when we make some money but this years been 
catastrophic 
his friend arten khishkhishian said he gave up fishing because 
his nets were torn by twisted rocket casings and lumps of shrapnel 
littering the shallow waters off jounieh and the ancient port of 
byblos a few miles north 
ive had to repair my net three times and that cost more than 
100000 pounds 200 he said i decided to stop this 
shrapnel fishing until theres lasting peace 
but the others risked their lives and their boats 15foot craft 
powered by outboard motors to haul in the dead fish sometimes a 
syrian barrage would come unexpectedly police said several 
fishermen were wounded 
kevork manoukian said that on one night it looked quiet so i 
dropped my net 
then the next minute a shell hit about 100 meters away from my 
boat he said i ditched my net and made it for the shore in 
panic as more shells exploded around me 
ornakian and other fishermen went out regularly for catches not 
much bigger than those they were netting before the fighting 
with fish in short supply in the enclave the price has doubled 
to the equivalent of about 450 a pound 
ornakian and the others reckon that the money they made from 
each trip the equivalent in lebanese pounds of about 250 was 
worth the chance 
moslem fishermen are banned from the waters off beirut where 
the syrians deployed batteries of longrange artillery along the 
waterfront to shell the christian coastline 
but the moslems are able to fish south of beirut for 50 miles 
down the coast to the ancient port of tyre where the biggest 
danger they face is an occasional israeli gunboat

a mysterious rash of leaked 
security files has led to new accusations that northern irelands 
embattled security forces are cooperating with protestant murder 
squads 
the british government is embarrassed the irish government is 
expressing dismay and the irish republican army is enjoying a 
propaganda windfall in its war to rid northern ireland of british 
rule 
desperate to build credibility with the deeply suspicious 
catholic minority the police force has taken the drastic step of 
calling in 19 detectives from england to conduct an independent 
inquiry into the source of the leaks 
the affair began aug 29 when british broadcasting corp 
reporter chris moore was taken blindfolded to meet four masked men 
who had files and a videotape to show 
the men claimed to belong to the ulster freedom fighters a 
shadowy protestant organization that specializes in killing 
catholics four days earlier the group had killed loughlin maginn 
a 38yearold catholic father of four 
the masked men said they wanted to convince the reporter that 
maginn was on file as an ira suspect and was not an innocent victim 
if as the ulster group claimed the files came from the 
security forces then how did they fall into the hands of an 
illegal and murderous organization 
the furor has worsened in the ensuing weeks as at least eight 
more security files have surfaced the files consist mainly of 
sheets of photos with names and addresses of ira suspects 
in the hands of the police or army the files are routine 
antiterrorism documents in the hands of the protestant group 
they are death lists 
this is an intolerable situation said seamus mallon a 
leading politician in northern ireland who while consistently 
critical of the security forces has in the past urged fellow 
catholics to cooperate with police investigations of ira outrages 
sinn fein the iras political wing has long claimed that 
collusion exists between the security forces and protestant groups 
mallon who belongs to the more moderate social democratic and 
labor party says the fact that files are leaking out of security 
bases all over the province points to a widespread problem 
the royal ulster constabulary the provinces police force has 
published a statement by its chief constable hugh annesley in all 
belfasts daily newspapers 
the ruc police will not tolerate wrongdoing should it be 
uncovered in its own ranks or flinch from tackling it in any other 
branch of the security forces or anywhere in society the 
statement said 
some lists have come to mallon others have gone straight to the 
media at least two disappeared from police stations and two more 
from bases of the locally recruited ulster defense regiment 
in most cases they have been mailed without explanation but 
one sent to a scottish newspaper came from a former soldier who 
said he wanted to show how easy it was to obtain such documents 
another sent anonymously to a london newspaper the 
independent included the names of 25 people living in the irish 
republic this added a fresh dimension to the controversy because 
it suggests that intelligence collected by irish police and shared 
with colleagues across the border may also be available to the 
murder squads 
deputy chief constable john stevens the english policeman 
leading investigations of the leaks said thursday that a british 
soldier serving in west germany was returned to his former posting 
in northern ireland after being questioned about leaked 
intelligence details were not available stevens also announced 
his inquiry team of 15 was strengthened to 19 
critics say some of those listed are simply victims of mistaken 
identity 
one is a wellknown businessman with no connection with 
subversive activity and at least six of the addresses published 
are wrong which puts the lives of innocent people in jeopardy 
joe oneill of sinn fein told a news conference 
the affair reflects the blurred line between law and lawlessness 
in a province where 20 years of conflict have spawned an array of 
illegal paramilitary outfits of catholic republicans and 
protestants loyal to britain 
the royal ulster constabulary knows it can isolate the ira only 
with the cooperation of catholics and it has made strenuous 
efforts to shed its old sectarian image 
its statistics show that last year more protestants than 
catholics were charged with murder even though catholics committed 
three times more murders 
indeed one theory holds that the protestants have chosen to 
publicize their alleged links with the security forces in 
retaliation for the royal ulster constabularys crackdown on their 
racketeering activities

they no longer wear white uniforms with roses 
in their lapels but every litter bit still counts to baltimores 
pushcart street sweepers who pick up where mechanical street 
sweepers leave off 
so popular are the 110 men and women who sweep shovel and spiff 
up the citys sidewalks and gutters that when one of them takes a 
vacation or sick leave its not unusual for residents to call the 
city and ask where they are 
the city calls them hokey men regardless of their sex 
because of their compact hokey carts stocked with cleaning 
tools and paper trash bags no one seems to remember how the carts 
got their name 
their job is to tidy the corners and crevices that the street 
sweepers cant reach they bag autumn leaves shovel snow and 
harvest the summers crop of used popsicle sticks and other trash 
they sweep between parked cars and scoop cigarette butts out of the 
cracks in the sidewalk 
baltimore which was incorporated in 1796 is by no means 
spotless and its age shows in many places nevertheless public 
works officials in other eastern cities are envious of baltimores 
cleanliness and the attention lavished on its public spaces by the 
hokey cart operators said james kapplin executive director of the 
citys public works museum 
it seems in the 20th century that its a very antique way to 
do things kapplin said but its really the only way to keep 
the city clean if you want to do the total job 
nowadays they fill out civil service applications and don 
fluorescent orange tshirts or overalls before setting out to erase 
the evidence of urban carelessness but a century ago men had to 
earn their way into an elite street cleaning corps known formally 
as the white wings and informally as the beauty squad 
from the days we were settled and through the 18th century 
roving bands of pigs and dogs cleaned the streets there werent 
any government services said kapplin 
that was changed by george waring who became new york citys 
commissioner of street cleaning in 1885 and transformed a menial 
task into an honorable calling by forming the first refuse patrols 
according to museum officials 
inspired by warings initiative baltimores white wings were 
organized about the turn of the century each man on the beauty 
squad wore white duck trousers a white jacket studded with brass 
buttons and a cork helmet the 5 cost of the uniform came out of 
the mens 10 weekly salaries according to museum officials some 
men added a natty touch by wearing a rose boutonniere 
sadly kapplin said respect for the elite squad declined around 
1920 after the special uniforms wore out and were replaced by drab 
gray outfits but the hokey men who evolved carry on the same 
tradition he said 
theyre very proud theyre career people 
actually the job is considered an entrylevel position paying 
a starting wage of 746 to 889 an hour but some of the hokey 
men like the work so much they never leave it 
im the type of person who likes to work outside i get to 
meet people said harold murdock a 16year hokey veteran to 
me its a great job 
gregory goods has belonged to the group only since last 
december but hes already got a pet peeve it bothers me when 
one car parks with its front end all the way over the sidewalk and 
you cant clean the space then when they leave it spoils the 
whole area makes it look like an eyesore 
nine hokey carts are detailed to the downtown area the rest are 
sprinkled along heavily traveled streets and in neighborhoods 
throughout the city 
the street cleaners develop a sense of belonging in the 
neighborhoods they patrol and the feeling is often mutual said 
orville a swafford head of the bureau of solid waste 
if a hokey man is sick we get loads of calls from people 
saying where is our hokey man swafford said also there 
was one who works on baltimore street who came back on his vacation 
to make sure his customers were being served

a civilian defense department employee dying of 
cancer in california wants to spend his last days in massachusetts 
where he grew up but the air force despite pressure from congress 
and a white house aide refuses to provide an air ambulance ride 
home 
even if regulations permitted the flight the air force says 
someone would have to pay for it and it could cost more than a 
civilian air ambulance 
avram brody was in and out of a coma thursday at his home in 
palmdale calif about 45 miles north of downtown los angeles the 
25yearold native of norwood learned he had an inoperable brain 
tumor a year ago just weeks before he was married 
he was a defense department computer operator for three years 
working on such projects as the b2 stealth bomber at edwards air 
force base in july doctors estimated he had a few weeks to live 
brody wants to die in his home state where most of his friends 
and relatives live but the latest estimate from a private air 
ambulance company is that it would cost 29000 to fly him coast to 
coast 
the air force citing regulations refuses to take on the job 
i understand their position that they just cant pick up and 
take anybody brodys wife amy said in a telephone interview 
but by the same token he worked for them he worked for his 
country defending his country and theyre not helping him in his 
time of need 
not for lack of influential help have the brodys failed to move 
the air force off its position 
rep joseph moakley dmass on the powerful rules committee 
and rep nicholas mavroulas dmass a member of the armed 
services committee have made inquiries sen john kerry dmass 
has been contacted andrew card a native of holbrook and a top 
aide to white house chief of staff john sununu has his staff 
working on the case 
but the air force is firm 
air force maj fran tunstall a press spokesman based in 
washington said brody might qualify for an airlift home if his 
illness were caused by his government work if the trip were 
necessary to receive some special medical treatment or if there 
were some chance for survival 
but even if brody met those criteria he would have to pay for 
the flight and tunstall estimated the cost at 30000 since it 
would involve a special trip for a plane stationed in illinois 
only if brody were a uniformed officer whose medical situation 
was a lifeordeath emergency could brody be eligible for a free 
flight he said 
tunstall said the air force was sensitive to brodys plight but 
had to draw the line somewhere on transporting government employees 
particularly when the flight involved costly medical preparations 
this isnt a greed factor he said 
it just seems so cold and heartless said state rep gregory 
sullivan who has been trying to help the brody family 
mrs brody 25 said her husbands medical problems began to 
crop up a few months before they were married but they went ahead 
with the ceremony 
we had planned on getting married and we didnt want to 
disrupt the event she said 
going to massachusetts also would make her life easier brody 
would be able to stay in a hospital for the terminally ill not far 
from his mothers home now he is bedridden at home and mrs brody 
has had to stop working to care for him 
one of the public officials working on the case is brad pearson 
a client advocate for the massachusetts office of handicapped 
affairs 
his wife is having to cope with the ultimate horror of seeing 
their joint future destroyed by a cruel death pearson said 
the question i would raise is this is elementary compassion too 
much to ask

several key members of congress say its time 
to overhaul a 35 million grant program which is supposed to help 
americansponsored schools and hospitals abroad but now is a 
foreign affairs pork barrel 
their assertion is backed up by internal state department 
records that show that administration officials routinely bend the 
rules in the american schools and hospitals abroad program in 
response to pressure from capitol hill 
my interest is in getting people to rethink the program 
said rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the foreign affairs 
subcommittee on the middle east the region where many of the 
program abuses are occurring its become a kind of foreign 
affairs pork barrel 
hamilton and rep david obey dwis showed their displeasure 
with the 28yearold program by ordering the agency for 
international development which runs it to withdraw a 15 
million grant intended for an ultraorthodox israeli school that 
trains teachers for other religious schools 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee has acknowledged he intervened to help an 
israeli school get a grant but said he now believes the process is 
out of hand 
the competition has become too fierce he said we now 
have the undignified prospect of individuals approaching senators 
and members of congress to lobby for their schools we did not 
envision this kind of political competition 
most of the complaints about political interference involve 
schools with heavily religious orientations particularly jewish 
institutions 
the american civil liberties union filed a lawsuit last year 
alleging that the program violated the constitutional separation of 
church and state the lawsuit names 20 roman catholic and jewish 
schools that received grants most of them because of political 
pressure 
most asha grants remain in line with the programs aim which is 
to showcase us achievements in education and medicine overseas 
the american university of beirut the american university in cairo 
and the hadassah medical center in jerusalem recipients of 
continuing aid are often cited as success stories 
but the rules for awarding grants state that assistance may 
not be used to train persons for religious pursuits or to construct 
buildings or other facilities intended for worship or religious 
instruction 
obey chairman of the house appropriations foreign operations 
subcommittee and hamilton ordered aid earlier this month to scotch 
a 15 million grant for shaalvim teachers college in israel and 
redirect the money to other institutions by saturday the end of 
the fiscal year 
the aim of the college an ultraorthodox jewish institution is 
to train rabbis and teachers who would work in settlements in areas 
such as the occupied west bank such a goal would be at odds with 
us policy which opposes israels settlement policy in the 
occupied lands 
despite its apparent ineligibility the school was put on the 
approved grant list after intervention by sen robert kasten 
rwis according to state department records and congressional 
sources 
in another case the american college of belz in israel had been 
turned down for grants almost annually from 1980 through 1984 its 
request ranked near the bottom of the merit list by independent 
reviewers 
but in 1985 aid administrator peter mcpherson awarded the 
school a 500000 grant without reference to the results of the 
fy 1985 review process according to an admission the department 
filed in the aclu lawsuit 
the grant was made because sen alfonse damato strongly 
expressed the view that the grant should be made and exerted 
pressure on aid to get it to make the grant the document stated 
the grant was approved even though the application had been 
filed a full year after the deadline the department said 
damato rny is on the senate appropriations committee 
which approves money for aid programs a fact that influenced mr 
mcpherson the department said 
telephone calls to damatos office were not immediately 
returned 
a spokesman for kasten jim sims said the senator was not alone 
in backing the shaalvim school and said it was unfair to single 
him out to my knowledge there was no opposition in the 
senate he said and he contended kasten was simply supporting 
the aid administrators action rather than influencing it 
the program receives requests for as much as three times the 
amount of aid its budget allows when projects near the bottom of 
the list are made eligible through exercise of political might 
institutions higher on the list lose out 
among other lawmakers named in the documents as applying 
pressure to make institutions eligible are sens rudy boschwitz 
rminn jesse helms rnc albert gore dtenn james sasser 
dtenn daniel inouye dhawaii and rep frank annunzio dill 
inouye was criticized two years ago when it was revealed he 
sought to funnel 8 million to a french school for african jews he 
was forced to rescind the grant after it generated public 
controversy 
in a letter to mark edelman acting aid administrator obey and 
hamilton warned they planned to closely monitor the program 
we may well object if changes are not made in the coming 
year they wrote

the fight over president bushs cut in the 
capital gains tax moves quickly to the senate and into electoral 
politics following the presidents hardfought victory in the house 
a highprofile democratic effort to derail the tax break which 
party leaders called a giveaway to the rich was beaten 239190 on 
thursday the democratic alternative contained a tax increase on 
the wealthy and 64 democrats defected to the presidents side 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
bushs house victory wasnt unexpected but that he would try to 
buck bush with an alternative of his own when his committee meets 
next week 
bentsen a longtime supporter of special tax treatment for 
capital gains earnings says the nation cant afford to give away 
too many new tax breaks with federal deficits running at 130 
billion a year 
however others in the senate were certain to push for the 
capital gains cut 
the bentsen plan would restore universally deductible individual 
retirement accounts an idea the house democrats proposal also 
embraced but his plan doesnt include their proposal to raise 
income taxes on the wealthy who now pay a lower marginal rate than 
the upper middle class 
setting a lower tax rate for capital gains which bush promised 
in his presidential campaign would reverse what was considered a 
major achievement of the 1986 tax overhaul supported by president 
reagan taxing earned and unearned income at the same rate 
the bush plan approved thursday as part of a huge 2000page 
budget bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on capital gains from 
33 percent to 196 percent for the next 27 months after that the 
rate would rise to 28 percent but taxes would not be paid on 
earnings attributable to inflation 
a lower capital gains rate will reduce the cost of capital and 
create incentives for investment in the longterm productive 
capacity of american industry bush said in hailing thursdays 
vote 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo called the plan a 
25000ayear tax cut on average to 375000 american families 
the wealthiest families in america for some decision they already 
made and not for new investment 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said the democrats took 
the correct position even though they lost and he would continue 
the fight 
this is not the end of the process it is the beginning he 
said 
in the house the capital gains fight was just one of many in 
the bill which will continue to occupy the chamber most of next 
week other less partisan battles are expected then on whether to 
repeal the medicare catastrophic illness insurance plan and on new 
federal support for child care 
regardless of the eventual fate of the bill the political 
implications of the vote will linger 
john buckley spokesman for the house gops campaign 
organization said his telephone facsimile machines were humming 
with press releases tagging any democrats who supported their party 
as voting for a tax increase and against jobs and prosperity 
this is one of those votes that you lie awake waiting for and 
we got it he said adding that it would be brought up again for 
the 1990 elections 
rep dennis eckart dohio said democrats also gained issues 
the ira the federal deficit and the economy 
both parties right now are plowing fertilizing and seeding 
the fields for next year he said

president bushs powerful victory on the 
capital gains tax calls into question whether house speaker thomas 
s foley and his democratic leadership team can marshal something 
more important than personal popularity votes 
on an issue where the democrats themselves drew the line in the 
sand calling the presidents position a gift to his rich friends 
64 of their own members crossed over to the other side the 
democrats gave bush the votes he needed for his 239190 win on 
thursday 
it puts a big dent in the leaderships new car said rep 
pat williams dmont and you remember that first dent the 
longest 
the defections cast doubt on whether foley and his team who 
took over just three months ago from their scandalplagued 
predecessors chose the right issue on which to confront bush 
since many democrats were already supporting a capital gains tax 
cut as a boon to the economy 
the vote also raised questions of political lethargy whether 
the democrats could have headed off the loss the process of 
putting together a democratic alternative was agonizingly slow and 
public completed less than a week before the decisive vote 
the alternate proposal to expand individual retirement accounts 
included a tax increase democrats argued that it applied only to 
the nations 600000 wealthiest taxpayers but it still was the 
political equivalent of taping a kick me sign on democratic 
members backs 
senate finance committee lloyd bentsen dtexas steered clear 
of that one when he raised the idea of reviving universal iras as 
an alternative to bushs tax cut bentsens panel begins working on 
the tax issue next week 
foley brushed aside the problems as he met with reporters to 
analyze the vote saying he was comfortable with the outcome 
i think it is a proud day i am satisfied we took a correct 
position he said 
foleys democratic opponents on the vote were quick to express 
their admiration of him and discomfort with having to go against 
their leadership 
i regret it ive not enjoyed this at all said rep mike 
andrews dtexas who was one of the six democrats who started the 
ball rolling by supporting bush in the ways and means committee 
i dont think you can just blame the leadership 
andrews and other democrats said there was little resemblance in 
this vote to 1981 when democrats held news conferences to decry 
their leadership and vote with president reagan 
any analogy to 1981 when the house passed reagans economic 
plan with the help of renegade democratic boll weevils has 
some major weaknesses reagan was riding high in the polls then as 
bush is now but seemed to have a greater ability to appeal 
directly to americans on teleision 
i dont think this is because of bush said rep vic 
fazio dcalif vice chairman of the house democratic caucus 
compared to ronald reagan this is not a guy who brings sweat to 
a brow of a member of congress this is nothing like that 
but democrats have to worry as republicans were all but 
gloating over the possibility that bush will enjoy a kinder and 
gentler version of the politics that led to reagans big victories 
republican newt gingrich of georgia the minority whip was 
plenty comfortable with that scenario he declared that the gop now 
has a working majority in the house because the democratic 
leadership was representing a liberal wing out of step with most 
americans 
white house budget director richard darman bubbling after the 
vote said that if we conduct ourselves well theres an 
opportunity to use some elements of the same coalition on other 
issues 
democrats tried to play down that scenario saying capital gains 
was an issue where many democrats had longfixed feelings that a 
lower capital gains rate would help boost the economy 
but there was almost no evidence that the democratic leadership 
had gently persuaded in foleys words any significant number 
to change their minds and back the party 
the complex politics of the capitol can always produce a silver 
lining though 
although foley fell short one top democratic aide chuckled that 
the leadership forced bush to deliver porkbarrel goodies to many 
democrats in order to keep their votes 
he had to help our guys get reelected in exchange for his 
legislative victory he said

massive losses in the fha insurance fund 
appear to combine the worst of the savings and loan crisis and the 
federal housing scandal and taxpayers again may wind up footing 
the bill congressional investigators say 
the fha losses half of them attributed to fraud and 
mismanagement have swelled the cost of the scandal at the 
department of housing and urban development almost overnight from 
22 billion to 69 billion officials said thursday 
the new estimate results from the disclosure that the 
departments federal housing administration mortgage insurance 
program lost 42 billion in 1988 alone 
with the sampls the farm credit system and now fha it seems to 
me there was almost a government meltdown in the 1980s said rep 
charles schumer dny head of a special house budget committee 
task force on potential fiscal crises said at a hearing thursday 
schumer whose panel is examining taxpayer exposure to abuses in 
several supposedly feebased selffinanced government insurance 
programs said the fha losses combine the worst of the sampl fiasco 
and the hud scandals 
the american people again may be left holding the bag for 
billions of dollars of waste mismanagement fraud and abuse he 
said schumer said the loss figure was a conservative estimate 
it sounds like a reasonable estimate to me paul adams 
huds inspector general told the panel 
comptroller general charles bowsher told the panel the chief 
causes of the fha mortgage insurance losses totaling 42 billion 
last year were the same as those that set off the sampl crisis that 
will cost taxpayers a minimum of 157 billion under a bill passed 
by congress last month 
some of the shortfall stemmed from homeowners in economically 
strapped areas of the country being unable to make their house 
payments bowsher said 
but he said at least half of it was due to mismanagement at hud 
plus fraud and undercapitalization by private insurers who started 
writing fha coverage in 1983 under the reagan administrations 
efforts to privatize the program 
you have to monitor whats happening in the private sector 
when you delegate to the private sector bowsher said its 
just like the sampls 
we dont know whats happening with the programs he said 
our budgeting and accounting systems are on a cash basis so no 
one has to report a problem until they have to write a check 
theres a culture of not bringing up bad news 
not that some officials didnt try adams had written several 
reports on abuses of hud programs before one last spring grabbed 
the attention of a house subcommittee and subsequently the media 
only since 1986 bowsher said has hud modernized its accounting 
systems enough for the general accounting office that he heads to 
even perform an audit of fha programs without that modernization 
it would have been at least another two years before the 42 
billion losses in 1988 would have surfaced 
adams said a dozen ongoing audits by his office and more than 
600 active investigations into fha activities confirm that many 
abuses are continuing 
despite several changes ordered by congress in 1987 such as 
requiring higher down payments and more creditworthiness reviews 
he said we continue to uncover schemes to defraud the program 
about 960 million of the fha loss was attributed to the 
socalled coinsurance program initiated by hud in 1983 
basically it allows private lenders to write fha insurance 
coverage for 80 percent of a mortgage assuming only 20 percent of 
the risk themselves but collecting large fees up front in the form 
of points 
but because many private lenders have little or no money of 
their own at risk as capital in the enterprises the government 
often gets stuck for the full tab if the borrower defaults 
house investigators cited instances of companies writing 
federally insured mortgages totaling 300 million with as little 
capital as 1 million 
the fbi is now investigating two of those companies drg 
funding corp of washington dc and benton mortgage co of 
knoxville tenn with losses in the tens of millions of dollars 
adams said he attempted several times to convince former hud 
secretary samuel pierce jr and other hud and fha officials to 
establish capital requirements for writers of fha mortgage 
insurance but was always rebuffed

the senate put itself on record early friday 
against legislation banning federal financial support for 
obscene art reversing a vote taken two months ago 
by 6235 the lawmakers rejected a nonbinding measure that 
voiced the senates backing for the prohibition it was the first 
time senators had been forced to disclose in the record vote their 
preferences in the issue 
the vote was taken after the bans sponsor sen jesse helms 
rnc invited senators to view photographs he brought to the 
senate floor that he said were obscene 
at one point he said he would seek to have the chamber cleared 
of all the pages all the staff and all the ladies so lawmakers 
could view the pictures but he did not follow up and the room was 
not cleared 
some lawmakers who oppose the helms amendment have been eager to 
avoid a roll call vote on it fearing that it could be used against 
them later 
what 30second ad might come out of this sen patrick 
leahy dvt said was a popular question among senators senator 
soandso voted for pornography 
helms introduced his amendment in july after being angered that 
the national endowment for the arts had paid 45000 for a pair of 
exhibitions one included photographs by the late robert 
mapplethorpe depicting homoerotic acts and the genitalia of 
children the other showed a photograph by andres serrano of a 
crucifix in a jar of urine 
the senate approved the ban july 26 on a voice vote in a nearly 
empty chamber attaching it to the 11 billion appropriations bill 
for the interior department and related agencies that carries 
government arts appropriations 
the house never adopted the provision voting 264153 against on 
sept 13 instead the house voted a cut of 45000 for the 
national endowment for the arts 
housesenate negotiators trying to work out a compromise 
appear on the verge of watering it down which angered helms 
fridays vote was on an amendment to the defense appropriations 
bill which would have directed senate members of the interior 
conference committee to stand fast for the ban 
the amendment would prohibit the use of federal money to exhibit 
obscene or indecent materials including but not limited to 
depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism the exploitation of 
children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
it also bars federal aid for material that denigrates people 
based on their religion race sex handicap age or ethnic origin

hundreds of residents queued up thursday 
to apply for money from the largest disasterrelief package ever 
approved by congress and president bush announced he would tour 
areas devastated by hurricane hugo 
as charlestons airport reopened for the first time since last 
weeks storm providing another channel for aid some officials 
criticized the government for creating a bottleneck by opening only 
five federal emergency management agency centers 
charleston mayor joseph p riley jr said limiting charleston 
itself to two fema offices was absolutely ridiculous 
we should have a couple of centers in rural counties we ought 
to have several centers in the urban counties he added 
in another development charleston county authorities early 
friday withdrew a report that the bodies of four more victims of 
hugo were found beneath a collapsed house 
mike spurgeon night supervisor for the county emergency medical 
service said search dogs had picked up four scents in the fishing 
village of mcclellanville and the state law enforcement division 
officer near the scene mistakenly reported that as four bodies 
he misunderstood it was four contacts there are no four 
additional deaths in mccllellanville said spurgeon adding that 
a dead animal or clothes with human scents could have triggered the 
dogs 
bush planned to make a predawn flight on friday to charleston 
which bore the brunt of hugos 135mph winds but he would have to 
complete his tour by midmorning in order to leave for annapolis 
md the white house said 
we need him to understand how deep the human suffering is in 
this gov carroll campbell said i want him to know that its 
a long haul for us and its not a quick fix 
as charlestons airport reopened for the first time since last 
weeks storm providing another channel for aid some officials 
criticized the government for creating a bottleneck by opening only 
five federal emergency management agency centers 
charleston mayor joseph p riley jr said limiting charleston 
itself to two fema offices was absolutely ridiculous 
we should have a couple of centers in rural counties we ought 
to have several centers in the urban counties he added 
the rev jesse jackson in charleston to visit shelters housing 
those displaced by the storm urged that bush not just come and 
visit a house or two but to come with a plan and resources 
jackson told reporters there is no sense of the massive 
federal presence that people deserve but praised local residents 
who have the good sense to turn to each other and not on each 
other 
later thursday congress unanimously approved 11 billion in 
emergency aid for victims of hugo the largest relief package ever 
for a natural disaster hugo may well be the most damaging one 
hurricane in history said fema spokesman bill mcada 
mcada said the aid cannot go to people insured for home or 
business losses the program provides loans up to 10000 for

a study showing that certain high blood pressure 
drugs may increase the risk of a heart attack suggests that some 
patients might be better off with other drugs doctors say 
the study reported thursday found that diuretics used by 15 
million americans with high blood pressure may increase the risk 
of a heart attack by raising levels of cholesterol and other fatty 
substances in the blood and by interfering with the bodys use of 
insulin and sugar 
previous studies had found that while diuretics lower blood 
pressure they do not lower the risk of a heart attack attempts to 
explain that phenomenon focused on the effect of diuretics on 
insulin and blood fats 
the new study published in the new england journal of medicine 
by dr thomas pollare dr hans lithell and colleagues at uppsala 
university in sweden involved making detailed measurements of 
insulin and sugar in 50 patients over three years it is the first 
to provide definitive evidence that the diuretics interfere with 
insulin use and increase blood fats the authors said 
the study was praised by dr james a schoenberger head of the 
preventive medicine department at rush presbyterianst lukes 
medical center in chicago and a former president of the american 
heart association 
i think its a major study because it gives us additional 
evidence for what many of us have suspected for a long time he 
said 
schoenberger said patients taking diuretics should not insist 
that they be taken off the drugs we dont want panic he said 
but everybody ought to ask how their doctors view the data in 
the study 
the study was of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide it is 
widely sold in generic form under that name and it is also 
contained in such brand name products as dyazide the bestselling 
diuretic 
dyazides manufacturer smithkline beecham pharmaceuticals in 
philadelphia issued a statement emphasizing that dyazide contains 
an additional drug that could ameliorate some of the effects noted 
in the study 
the statement also said longterm studies found that the effects 
cited in the new study do not last more than a year 
the study found that another high blood pressure drug called 
captopril produced beneficial changes in insulin and sugar use and 
had no effect on blood cholesterol and triglycerides 
captopril is one of a class of high blood pressure drugs called 
angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitors or ace inhibitors it is 
made by the squibb corp of princeton nj which held a news 
conference thursday in new york to publicize the study squibbs 
swedish affiliate contributed some of the financial support for the 
study 
the two other principal classes of high blood pressure drugs in 
addition to diuretics and ace inhibitors are calciumchannel 
blockers and beta blockers 
in studies published in the last few months pollare and lithell 
have shown that beta blockers have an even more deleterious effect 
than diuretics on insulin sugar and blood fats calciumchannel 
blockers had no effect on insulin sugar or fats they found

house and senate negotiators struck a bargain 
thursday to delay preliminary work for offshore oil and gas 
exploration off the california coast a compromise between energy 
interests and drilling opponents 
the two sides agreed to a fivemonth halt next year in many 
preliminary activities in effect the deal gives drilling foes 
five more months to continue their efforts to block production 
the provision is slated to become part of a compromise 11 
billion spending bill for federal land and cultural programs in the 
interior department and related agencies during the fiscal year 
beginning sunday bargainers from the two houses hoped to complete 
their work on the bill friday 
negotiators also adopted provisions to forbid lobbyists who help 
clients gain federal aid to be paid with federal dollars they 
obtain those lobbyists would also generally be required to file 
public reports on their activities with congress 
the senate also rejected an amendment that would have directed 
conferees to stand fast on a ban of financial support for 
obscene art the 6235 vote early friday reversed a vote taken 
two months ago on the amendment introduced by sen jesse helms 
rnc 
helms introduced the measure in july after being angered that 
the national endowment for the arts had paid 45000 for a pair of 
exhibitions one included photographs by the late robert 
mapplethorpe depicting homoerotic acts and the genitalia of 
children while the other showed a photograph by andres serrano of 
a crucifix in a jar of urine 
the house never adopted a ban on socalled obscene art voting 
264153 against on sept 13 and instead voting to cut 45000 for 
the endowment 
as has been routine since the early 1980s the legislation 
imposes another oneyear moratorium on leasing and drilling in 
federal waters off alaska much of california florida and much of 
the northeast 
the fivemonth delay in preleasing activities is favored by 
drilling opponents who say it would help postpone drilling if the 
moratorium were ever lifted those activities include such work as 
studies on how the environment would be effected by the work and 
public hearings 
the house had earlier approved a oneyear restrictions on 
prelease activities while the senate had no such provision 
the issue has been an important one in environmentally conscious 
california even before the march exxon valdez oil spill in alaska 
that aroused additional public concern 
president bush has imposed a delay on lease sales off california 
until jan 1 when a task force he appointed is due to report 
under the agreement reached thursday prelease activities short 
of the release of a preliminary environmental impact study could 
not proceed until five months after that task force report is ready 
this will allow time for california and for congress to digest 
the report said rep bill lowery rcalif who pressed for the 
delay 
the lobbying restrictions sponsored by sen robert byrd 
dwva were weakened somewhat from their original version 
violations would be punishable by fines of from 10000 to 
100000 instead of the 100000 byrd had sought and reporting 
requirements which byrd proposed applying to all lobbyists seeking 
federal money would only apply to those whose contracts exceed 
100000 in addition the defense department would be allowed to 
waive the provisions 
negotiators on the helms amendment remained at odds over whether 
standards attempting to describe what constitutes obscene art 
should be enacted into law while a commission studies the issue

finance officials from 152 nations are heading 
home with progress but no final decisions on whether to boost 
japans standing in the international monetary fund and while 
increasing the funds resources 
michel camdessus the former french central bank chief who 
serves as managing director of the imf is urging that the funds 
resources called quotas be doubled from 120 billion to 240 
billion 
the increase is needed he argued to meet the agencys growing 
responsibilities in the 1990s including aiding treasury secretary 
nicholas f bradys strategy to reduce the third worlds crushing 
debt burden and helping eastern european nations convert their 
economies from state control to free enterprise 
also discussed during the threeday annual meeting of the imf 
and its sister organization the world bank were world 
environmental problems and efforts by the major industrial nations 
to stabilize their currencies exchange rates 
both organizations headquartered in washington were founded 
after world war ii to promote economic growth and stability 
on thursday after the closing session camdessus expressed 
confidence that agreement can be reached on a quota increase by the 
end of the year 
nineteen members of the funds 22member executive board support 
a quota increase of 67 percent or more he said but saudi arabia 
great britain and the united states which holds veto power on the 
question have yet to sign on 
quotas are supplied from member nations reserves and can be 
withdrawn at any time an increase would not add to the us budget 
deficit 
president bush told the organizations the united states 
recognizes that the imf must have adequate resources to fulfill its 
critical role and pledged to work on reaching a decision by the 
end of the year 
however treasury officials say the administration remains 
unconvinced that imf needs as much as its leaders are requesting 
complicating the debate are touchy questions of national 
prestige for the united states closest allies in exchange for 
contributing reserves each nation receives a commensurate share of 
voting power in the imf 
japan has expressed a willingness to recycle more of the revenue 
from its huge trade surplus through the imf but only in exchange 
for more influence in the organization 
it already holds the no 2 slot in the world bank and wants to 
vault from fifth to second in the fund behind only the united 
states in voting power that would displace great britain which 
despite the efforts of prime minister margaret thatcher has fallen 
behind japan as a world economic power 
delegates said a compromise is emerging that would permit japan 
and west germany to share the second slot while france and great 
britain would share the fourth position 
meanwhile world bank president barber b conable a former 
republican member of congress from new york is seeking a 
replenishment of the banks international development agency which 
makes lowinterest loans to the worlds poorest nations 
the united states is the lone holdout among 34 nations over 
providing 145 billion for three years worth of loans in part 
because its share of 32 billion would add to the budget deficit 
unlike an increase in imf quotas 
in other developments at the meetings 
bush and the other western leaders warmly encouraged polish 
finance minister leszek balcerowiczs efforts to secure aid in his 
countrys historic conversion of its economy from communism to 
capitalism however they withheld promising specific amounts until 
poland agrees to a program of economic reforms with the imf 
officials said that could come in as soon as two months 
the imf on wednesday granted argentina latin americas third 
largest debtor a 14 billion stabilization loan in reward for 
economic reforms instituted by its new president carlos menem 
however moves last week by three large us banks to add to 
loan loss reserves for developing country debt raised concern among 
delegates that banks would be unwilling to follow the write offs 
with enough new lending to keep the borrowing countries growing 
bush camdessus and other officials used the meetings as an 
occasion to urge bankers to continue to lend 
the group of seven united states japan west germany great 
britain france canada and italy announced an accord on exchange 
rates the groups central banks starting monday intervened 
vigorously in currency markets driving the dollars value down 
the effort was aimed at reducing the us trade deficit and the 
german and japanese trade surpluses

secretary of state james a baker iii says he is 
hopeful israel and palestinian arabs will start negotiations on the 
future of the west bank and gaza 
baker said israel would bring to the talks a plan by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir for holding elections in the territories 
the palestinians he said would bring a 10point election 
formula proposed by egyptian president hosni mubarak 
but baker stressed at a news conference thursday that the bush 
administration supports shamirs proposal and views mubaraks as 
simply a means of trying to assist to get the parties to the 
table 
he said mubaraks 10 points were not intended as a substitute 
for shamirs plan for elections to choose palestinians for 
negotiations however baker did not explain how the two ideas 
could be meshed 
shamir has described the mubarak formula as a prescription for 
israeli surrender 
it calls on israel to commit itself to giving up territory and 
to dealing in the negotiations with palestinians deported during 
the 22month uprising on the west bank and in gaza 
baker discussed the two approaches in a threeway meeting with 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens and egyptian foreign minister 
esmet abdelmeguid 
afterward baker told reporters they had a good discussion 
and there may be some potential for progress 
but baker was cautious 
we really will not know until key members of the israeli 
cabinet meet in jerusalem next wednesday baker said

teacher union leader albert shanker 
has a thoughtprovoking way of looking at the monumental chore left 
by the historic twoday education summit with president bush and 
the nations governors 
i think you have to view this like trying to find a cure for a 
disease said shanker head of the american federation of 
teachers you dont know exactly what may work but you know 
that if you provide the right resources give people the right 
incentives you know that over a period of time they will 
the nation will see results from the summit in five to 10 years 
he said warning anybody who thinks that with 40 million kids 
and 2 million teachers you can turn the system around in one or 
two years is foolish 
bush and the governors met for two days at the university of 
virginia to hammer out a process intended to result in the entire 
nation teachers parents school boards administrators 
businessmen politicians setting national goals on what children 
should learn and when where they should learn it and what type of 
people should teach them 
bush couldnt have provided a better setting drawing the state 
chief executives to the placid picturesque blue ridge mountain 
area of thomas jeffersons school he courted them royally wining 
and dining them in jeffersons home perched on a mountaintop with 
a breathtaking view 
but he declined pleas for more federal money for public schools 
administration officials indicate that extra help probably will 
come once the goals are settled possibly in the form of loosening 
the red tape normally attached with federal school funds 
some governors particularly democrats who had earlier said 
they wanted more federal money walked away instead with a list of 
goals with no funds attached 
however the governors succeeded in pressing bush for a greater 
commitment to one day making the head start program available to 
more disadvantaged preschoolers a stronger statement than he 
earlier indicated he was willing to make 
lofty goals and education reform ideas are nothing new for the 
nations governors many of whom already have embarked on ambitious 
programs to improve the education system in 1986 the nga outlined 
a fiveyear agenda on education and each year since then the 
governors have reported their states progress 
certainly this isnt the kind of issue thats going to be 
resolved even by something as historic as this education summit 
ordered by the president said ohio gov richard celeste 
for many of us legitimizing the reform agenda and putting 
sort of the white house good housekeeping seal of approval on the 
reform agenda is a plus 
iowa gov terry branstad chairman of the national governors 
association said each governor is expected to work with the ngas 
education task force to develop the goals a preliminary report 
complete with timetables should be completed by the ngas february 
meeting where bush has been invited to attend branstad said 
as shanker puts it we need the right step to define the 
goals if you get the wrong goals and the wrong measurements this 
will all turn into a pile of garbage because whatever they decide 
are goals everybody has got to be doing so they better be 
right 
the summit said shanker is the major turning point i think 
they discussed the right issues and they came up with the right 
answers 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
said the governors need to assess the efforts that already are 
going on in individual school districts 
then leaders can focus on worthwhile goals and toss out the 
trendy solutions 
montana gov stan stephens is convinced some results the 
intangible ones will be evident shortly 
i think youll see attitudes change i think youre going to 
see cooperation stephens said in that sense i think you are 
going to see it right away 
but to restructure education and to redefine goals its going 
to be an ongoing thing its going to take a lot to do that because 
our educational system in this country to a great extent has not 
changed that much while the world has changed 
fifteen 20 years ago we werent dealing in an international 
marketplace we are today he said we used to compete amongst 
ourselves now we are competing with the world

the senate in restoring 600 million to star 
wars seeks to strengthen its negotiating position with a 
democraticcontrolled house looking to slash funds from president 
bushs missile defense shield 
its a bargaining strategy for the conference sen carl 
levin dmich said shortly after the senate reversed field 
thursday and restored twothirds of the money it had cut for star 
wars 
it doesnt represent an increase in support for star wars 
levin said 
the dramatic 5347 vote on the strategic defense initiative 
commonly known as star wars was capped by final passage early 
today of the 288 billion military spending bill 
the vote on the overall bill was 962 with sens mark hatfield 
rore and kent conrad dnd voting against the legislation and 
sens lloyd bentsen dtexas and james m jeffords rvt not 
voting 
the spending bill adopted after four days of debate includes 
the following provisions 
elimination of all 18 billion for procurement of the trident 
2 missile but an increase of 70 million to bushs request of 216 
million for research and development of the submarinelaunched 
weapon the senate action came more than one month after a trident

house and senate members will meet in conference next week to 
thrash out a final version of the appropriations bill 
on star wars the senate approved a total of 43 billion and 
gave members of the senate armed services committee more room to 
maneuver in talks with the house 
the senate in approving its authorization bill last month 
approved 45 billion for star wars the house adopted a funding 
level of 31 billion 
lack of progress on a final version gave way to confident house 
members indicating thursday morning that they would not accept a 
star wars funding level higher than 35 billion their argument 
the senate vote tuesday night in which the chamber slashed 900 
million from the missile defense shield 
it shot a hole in the poor senate position take that sam 
nunn rep patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the house 
armed services committee said wednesday 
but nunn the georgia democrat who chairs the senate armed 
services committee would not stand for having his bargaining 
position undercut he easily gained the support of the key 
republicans senate minority leader bob dole and sen john warner 
of virginia ranking gop member on the armed services committee 
and took his case to the senate 
i am not a cheerleader for sdi i always voted to cut some of 
the program nunn told his colleagues but i also felt it was a 
valuable research program 
were not going to negotiate between 37 billion and 28 
billion where does that leave us nunn said maybe well sit 
here until thanksgiving maybe well do that im convinced the 
only way to do it is to send a signal to the house conferees 
but sen bennett johnston dla questioned whether senators 
really believe the house is weakwilled and weakminded and 
wouldnt know whats going on here 
however the amendment prevailed and the senate negotiators on 
the authorization bill laid claim to what they believe is a 
stronger hand in the conference 
once we determined the conference depended on it star wars 
the strength developed warner said its cyclical were 
concluding this day on a high note 
but there was a note of dissent from some lawmakers 
part of the bargaining strategy was a close senate vote for 
improving our bargaining position whether it succeeds remains to 
be seen said sen james exon dneb a member of the armed 
services committee and sdi supporter who noted that congressmen 
wont be fooled over there

conservative civil rights activists agree with 
one of the national urban leagues criticisms of president bushs 
civil rights record hes said the right things so far but hasnt 
done much 
here we are almost a year into it and its not very clear what 
direction they are going to take clint bolick director of the 
landmark legal foundation center for civil rights said thursday 
what i have not seen in the area of empowerment of 
minorities is much beyond rhetoric he added there seems to 
be a duality of purpose i have seen the right rhetoric some 
inconsistent actions and not enough action 
daniel l casey executive director of the american conservative 
union agreed i am not exactly sure if i can tell you exactly 
where they stand on civil rights i call it schizophrenia he 
said 
the remarks were similar to what urban league officials said 
after bush told the leagues annual conference aug 8 that his 
administration is committed to reaching out to minorities to 
striking down barriers to free and open access 
john jacob the president of the league said after the 
presidents speech he is saying the right things now we have to 
find out whether he is willing to do the right things 
and joseph e lowery president of the southern christian 
leadership conference commented we have heard mr bush say the 
right words now he must turn on the music and dance 
despite the comments the conservatives and the orthodox civil 
rights leaders have sharply differing agendas 
the urban league members back traditional affirmative action 
programs are dismayed by recent supreme court decisions eroding 
the programs and are backing legislation to overturn those 
decisions 
the conservatives oppose the affirmative action programs as 
reverse discrimination are delighted by the high courts rulings 
and are gearing up to fight the remedial legislation proposed in 
congress 
i think that i am talking about something very different than 
john jacob and his folks are talking about said bolick 
when bush went to the urban league he gave a very different 
message than they were used to hearing he said so far the 
rhetoric is solidly on our side of the equation i dont know 
whether those subtle nuances are not being grasped by the other 
side or whether i am being naive about exactly what they are 
saying 
in any event he said the administration should more 
aggressively defend the supreme courts recent decisions 
in its last session the court struck down a 30 percent minority 
setaside requirement for government contracts in richmond va 
stiffened the requirements for statistical proof in job 
discrimination cases and held that settlements in such cases can be 
challenged later by employees who were not a party to it 
bills have been introduced to reverse some of the effects of 
those decisions 
the day these bills were introduced the bush administration 
should have introduced legislation dealing with some of the issues 
or at least establishing a commission to recommend such 
legislation bolick said thus far the administration is

the top us diplomat in panama told 
an opposition leader that washington has no immediate plans to lift 
economic sanctions aimed at forcing gen manuel antonio noriega 
from power 
charge daffaires john maisto said the sanctions imposed last 
year after noriega was indicted in florida on drug trafficking 
charges are having their effect and will continue 
maisto thursday met with opposition leader guillermo endara who 
is on the ninth day of a hungerstrike endara hopes to persuade 
panamanians to stop playing the lottery gambling in casinos or 
going to the racetrack and thus deprive the government of needed 
revenue

in panama maisto said he called noriega a dictator who uses 
force and who will continue using force like all dictators until 
the day they leave 
michael polt a us political officer accompanied maisto 
ambassador arthur davis left the country in may to show displeasure 
at noriegas refusal to step down 
among the us sanctions washington froze panamanian government 
assets in the united states and barred american companies from 
paying panamanian taxes canal revenues owed to panama were also 
frozen 
last week washington announced it was putting 14 panamanian 
companies and individuals on a trade blacklist us companies were 
prohibited from dealing with the 14 
noriega who controls the government as chief of the panamanian 
defense forces has denied the drug trafficking and money 
laundering charges 
endara was the opposition coalition candidate in may 7

unfortunate very unfortunate and all of us and all the countries 
of good will hope this does not occur 
earlier thursday attorney general carlos villalaz warned that 
anyone urging civil disobedience will be investigated

the partisan dispute over funding for amtrak 
is putting a crack in the consensus for major legislation to 
guarantee the rights of the disabled 
the dispute arose thursday in a hearing of a house energy and 
commerce transportation subcommittee studying the impact of the 
proposed americans with disabilities act on amtrak 
the legislation endorsed by the bush administration and already 
passed this month by the senate includes provisions guaranteeing 
the disabled access to rail transportation 
amtrak would have to spend millions of dollars to comply with 
the act the bush administration however wants to end federal 
subsidies for amtrak 
we cant agree to make amtrak accessible to the disabled if 
theres no amtrak subcommittee chairman thomas a luken dohio 
told philip calkins of the presidents committee on employment of 
people with disabilities 
calkins had told the subcommittee that the cost of adding 
accessibility is secondary to assuring the civil rights of the 
countrys 43 million disabled 
you are lecturing us about money which we would want to 
provide but the administration says it will veto the money if we 
provide the money luken said he said the house will probably 
pass the bill along the lines of saying how do to it and then not 
pay for it 
the house and senate have passed separate bills giving amtrak 
615 million for fiscal 1990 with 85 million for capital 
improvements the administration wants to eliminate subsidies for 
amtrak saying it serves less than onehalf of 1 percent of all 
intercity travel 
amtrak chief w graham claytor jr told the subcommittee it will 
cost 52 million over 20 years to modify stations under the act 
that includes costs to meet access requirements mandated by the 
overlapping rehabilitation act of 1973 amtrak says that low 
subsidies during the reagan administration have hindered its 
ability to meet those requirements

the federal government is losing ground in its 
program to clean up the nations most dangerous hazardous waste 
dumps 
in eight years cleanup work has been completed on only about 
three dozen sites and on thursday the environmental protection 
agency added 93 new properties in 32 states that need to be cleared 
of hazardous waste and debris 
the additional sites bring to 1194 the waste dumps scheduled to 
be decontaminated under the superfund program which is aimed at 
dealing with the nations most hazardous waste problems epa 
officials have said the program likely will cost tens of billions 
of dollars and take decades 
the national priority list for cleanup projects would have grown 
even more except for a decision by the epa to also delete 31 sites 
that had been on the list 
of the 31 sites 27 are to be shifted to another cleanup program 
within the agency cleanup activities were to continue at those 27 
sites but not under the superfund program said epa spokeswoman 
mary mears 
the other four sites were deleted because the health risks 
associated with them no longer were considered sufficient to meet 
the superfund criteria said ms mears 
the national priority list represents the worst of an estimated 
30000 hazardous waste dumps in need of treatment nationwide 
since 1980 congress has appropriated more than 8 billion for 
removal of toxic and radioactive materials from contaminated sites 
under the superfund program 
earlier this month a study by the rand corp concluded that the 
superfund program has been superslow in dealing with the toxic 
waste dump problem and that the epa has not been aggressive enough 
in getting polluters to pay for the cleanup 
during the programs first eight years cleanup was finished at 
only 34 of the 1175 sites on the priority list at the time of the 
study the rand corp analysis said the report also criticized the 
agency for not spending more of the money provided by congress for 
cleanup 
epa administrator william reilly has acknowledged that work has 
been completed at only a small number of superfund sites but 
maintains the number does not reflect the overall progress that has 
been made in the program 
at many sites substantial work has been completed and in many 
cases the most severe health threats have been mitigated or even 
eliminated although work technically has not been finished epa 
officials maintain 
the additional target locations for cleanup announced thursday 
were spread over 32 states and puerto rico sixteen of the 
additional sites were in pennsylvania nine in california and seven 
in washington state 
among the new sites were 11 federal facilities including the 
rocky flats plutonium processing plant in colorado and four nuclear 
weapons plants near hanford wash 
these facilities joined 52 other military installations nuclear 
fuel processing plants and other federal facilities already on the 
epa priority cleanup list 
reilly recently announced plans to put greater emphasis on 
getting polluters to pay for cleanup projects through civil suits 
and a threat of penalties 
sen frank lautenberg dnj chairman of the senate superfund 
subcommittee and a frequent critic of the epas handling of the 
cleanup program said the announcement that additional sites had 
been put on the priority list marks an important step forward in 
getting these sites cleaned up 
overall he added the program continues to have problems

coastal property owners in this 
hurricanescarred state are being told a tough new conservation law 
wont necessarily keep them from rebuilding on the waters edge 
we dont want people to panic said h wayne beam executive 
director of the south carolina coastal council people are 
calling us asking if all of myrtle beach will be affected by the 
law and it will not be 
the 18member council administers the controversial beachfront 
management act passed last year in response to an accelerating 
erosion problem blamed on overdevelopment of the states coastline 
the law which took effect in july 1988 bans new construction 
within a socalled dead zone extending inland 20 feet from an 
established dune line and prohibits the rebuilding of any home or 
hotel in the zone that suffers more than twothirds damage 
the controversial law was already under challenge before 
hurricane hugo hit last week homeowners on hilton head island had 
filed suit in federal court and the state senate passed a revision 
giving the council more latitude to permit rebuilding within the 
dead zone the house has not given its approval 
hugo cut a swath of destruction along more than half of the 
states 187mile coastline last week and hundreds of coastal 
property owners are worried they wont be able to rebuild 
the council met thursday to streamline recovery efforts owners 
of damaged buildings seawalls and docks will receive a 
construction permit without having to file for individual 
permission those who must rebuild will have to apply for special 
permission 
the council also agreed to permit hotels to rebuild oceanfront 
swimming pools damaged or destroyed by the storm and reallocated 
10 million distributed before hugo to refurbish the states 
beaches hilton head island officials returned 625 million 
allocated to them before the storm which left their beaches 
largely unscathed 
state tourist industry offficials were urging quick action to 
get beach resort areas back in shape for next years season 
we represent a large part of the states golden goose said 
myrtle beach mayor bob grissom we need to get to business 
yesterday 
while there are no estimates available on the number of beach 
properties destroyed by hugo a survey taken before the storm found 
that only 200 owners did not have enough property to rebuild their 
structures by moving them several feet inland 
the other 700 structures in the survey were on lots big enough 
for the owners to move them outside the dead zone 
beam also said the twothirds damage clause will be liberally 
interpreted 
there will be some losses but a house will have to be in bad 
shape to be considered twothirds destroyed he said i believe 
there will be many buildings that may be condemned by local 
standards that will not be considered beyond repair by us 
under the councils regulations even homes lifted off 
foundations or pilings can be replaced at their original site

president bushs clean air bill now includes a 
requirement for vaportrapping canisters in cars despite a 
lawmakers warning that the devices may be motorized bombs 
the house energy and commerce environment subcommittee added the 
provision thursday in a unanimous voice vote that included the 
consent of rep john d dingell the lawmaker who expressed the 
safety concern amendment supporters said the canisters could be 
made safe 
dingell dmich agreed only after the panel voted to require 
consultation by federal officials to ensure the devices are safe 
before theyre installed to trap gasoline fumes 
the requirement an effort to reduce cancer risk would take 
effect four years after the bill became law and would apply only to 
cars sold in the most polluted cities gasoline vapors have been 
classified as a probable carcinogen by epa causing an estimated 25 
to 75 cancer cases annually 
meanwhile subcommittee chairman henry a waxman dcalif 
negotiated privately with lawmakers to win support for his proposal 
to toughen bushs standards for auto tailpipe emissions the 
negotiators were deadlocked over waxmans demand for a second phase 
of emissions reductions early in the next century 
waxman offered the canister amendment arguing that we have 
never heard any reputable source actually indicate that onboard 
canisters present a real safety risk 
he said the governments national highway traffic safety 
administration and the center for auto safety founded by ralph 
nader have concluded the technology exists to make the devices 
safe 
the onboard charcoal canisters have long been sought by 
environmental groups and the environmental protection agency staff 
but were rejected by top bush administration officials who write 
the clean air bill 
some states and cities among them california and new york 
washington dc and st louis already have approved another 
method of capturing the gasoline vapors special boots on gasoline 
pumps that include hoses to recycle fumes back to the underground 
storage tank 
auto industry officials have said the canisters could catch fire 
after an accident although there is no hard evidence from test 
vehicles of that happening 
dingell warned that the canisters could force motorists to 
ride around in motorized bombs 
if you want to ride around in exploding vehicles you can 
support this amendment with enthusiasm dingell said as the panel 
neared the end of its second week of amending the bush legislation 
but waxman argued the canisters would reduce emissions more than 
controls at the gas pump adding the pump controls cost seven times 
as much 
multinational business services inc which studied the 
canister issue for the domestic and imported auto industries said 
the devices would cost an average of 83 per car initially and 37 
per car later although amounts would vary with each model but 
waxman and the epa estimated the average cost at about 14 per car 
the firm concluded that capturing the vapors at the pump would 
be more effective because it would take 16 years to implement the 
canister program the figure was based on lead time necessary for 
automakers plus the time needed for older cars to go out of service 
white house officials decided to use the gasoline pump controls 
in its clean air bill and top epa officials went along despite the 
staff recommendation 
this is an administration decision said william rosenberg 
epa assistant administrator for air programs i have no problem 
with these kinds of tradeoffs 
epa officials said the auto industry has favored the gas pump 
controls which would place the expense on the oil companies and 
service stations the oil industry has backed the canisters so that 
carmakers would bear the expense 
the amendment would give the epa administrator a year after the 
bills enactment to set standards for lightduty motor vehicles 
which could include cars as well as pickup trucks the canisters 
would take effect three years after the rules were approved 
the systems would have to capture 95 percent of the vapors and 
the epa administrator could waive the requirement once the 
canisters were in widespread use

the pentagons chief watchdog is investigating 
the diversion of hundreds of millions of dollars to other agencies 
to award defense contracts without competitive bidding 
the arrangement described as a moneylaundering operation 
by the chairman of the senate governmental affairs committee was 
detailed thursday in testimony by the defense departments 
inspector general 
its not outside of the law however its a procedure that 
has been undertaken to avoid some of the constraints and the 
regulations that surround the contracting process said june 
gibbs brown the pentagons inspector general 
it has escalated astronomically since it started she told 
the senate panel 
the pentagon cycled 200 million through the energy departments 
research laboratory at oak ridge tenn for contractors to perform 
management consulting for the defense department the panel was 
told 
the pentagon transferred another 84 million to a library of 
congress program where contractors hired subcontractors for the 
same purpose 
the inspector general is investigating similar deals involving 
other federal research centers operated by private contractors for 
the energy department said derek j vander shaaf the pentagons 
deputy inspector general 
the system is being abused to avoid the competition in 
contracting act he said 
the pentagon used the library of congress federal library and 
information network known as fedlink to award the contracts 
under provisions of the economy in government act 
the law intended to avoid costly duplication in procurement 
allows one agency to ask another to procure items it needs 
fedlink allows other federal libraries to use the vast resources 
of the library of congress and centralizes procurement for these 
facilities 
then somebody got the bright idea to try to finance the 
operation of the library by passing this money through the 
system vander schaaf said the library of course kept its 15 
percent management fee from any money returned to the pentagon 
private contractors for the fedlink subcontracted the work for 
the pentagon for a fee he said 
it gives those individuals in government that have friends or 
have firms that they know or have other relationships it gives 
them an opportunity to direct a contract to a particular individual 
or a firm vander schaaf said 
but vander schaaf said the investigation so far had not 
documented any examples of officials personally benefiting from 
these arrangements 
in the case of the energy department martin marietta corp 
which operates the oak ridge lab arranged for subcontracts with 
pentagon money transferred to the energy department he said 
it could also be used as a laundering operation to avoid 
endoftheyear fiscal restraints sen john glenn dohio the 
panels chairman said 
vander schaaf replied that about 40 percent of the money sent 
through oak ridge was spent at the end of the fiscal year so the 
pentagon could avoid losing the money 
the committee also heard testimony about contract abuse at other 
agencies 
nasas inspector general bill d colvin reported that 81 
percent of subcontracts were awarded without competitive bidding 
colvin said 33 percent of the national aeronautics and space 
administration subcontracts he audited were overpriced and 12 
percent had yielded profits exceeding 100 percent 
he said 80 percent of contract abuse he found involved criminal 
fraud there were 300 cases of fraud under active investigation 
plus another 300 awaiting his staffs attention colvin said 
john c layton inspector general for the energy department 
said private contractors were reimbursed for expenses even when the 
agency found instances of fraud and abuse

nasa should put off development of a new space 
shuttle rocket and instead try to perfect the rocket now being used 
for the accelerated space shuttle program says the head of a nasa 
safety advisory board 
joe sutter chairman of the aerospace safety advisory panel 
told a house subcommittee thursday that nasa cant have it both 
ways by stepping up shuttle launches with rocket boosters that 
officials want to be replaced 
it makes me quite nervous to use old rockets in an 
intensified program if nasa lacks confidence in them sutter said 
either the rockets can be used or theyd better not fly 
the national aeronautics and space administration has been 
rebuilding the shuttle program that ground to a halt after the 1986 
challenger disaster the agency hopes to have as many as 14 annual 
launches by 1994 
the latest shuttles launched are using a redesigned solid rocket 
motor to propel the booster which launches the orbiter into space 
the design changes were made to correct flaws responsible for the 
challenger explosion which was blamed on problems with the rocket 
joints 
but nasa is also committed to developing a socalled advanced 
solid rocket motor and over the objections of the safety panel 
contracted to develop 44 of them at a cost of 11 billion the 
first ones are to be delivered in 1994 
the new design emphasizes welds over bolts allows for 
mechanical closing of joints and has different seals that permit 
more visual inspection nasa says construction of the new rocket 
would be more automated nasa says leaving less room for human 
error 
it is still the number one priority with me said jr 
thompson nasa deputy administrator it is the last system that 
failed when it fails it always fails catastrophically 
sutter speaking to the house science space and technology 
science subcommittee said that nasa needs to have a tried and true 
shuttle rocket ready for the space station program in 1995 because 
that new program will rely on the shuttle for construction supply 
and operation 
sutter said that although the advanced rocket motor may be 
inherently safer it may not be realistically safer in 
1995 by then he said the current rocket motor will have had 50 
to 75 successful flights

the handful of black americans 
living in south africa experience apartheid uniquely they feel the 
personal insult of race discrimination but they cannot share black 
south africans sense of oppression 
the little things ive been through are nothing compared to 
growing up in a place like this and being told youre inferior 
said becky ginsburg of los angeles she has worked with church 
groups in south africa for two years 
personal discrimination against me is the least of it more 
painful is how south africans are being outraged ms ginsburg 
said 
vernon grigg a yale law school student who is the first black 
to clerk for a johannesburg supreme court judge described his 
initial view of south africa as the plane rolled up truckloads 
of black men in uniforms were being driven up to clean the plane 
grigg arrived on sept 6 election day when millions of blacks 
stayed home to protest their exclusion from the voting a week 
later he joined 15000 people in an antiapartheid march through 
johannesburg 
i realized for the first time of my life im a part of the 
majority just by the fact that im black its an empowering 
feeling said grigg 
dee nealy 30 who came from boston with her family to set up a 
church of christ ministry in the black township of soweto feels 
differently 
even though blacks are a majority i feel like a minority 
she said its just because of the way people are classified 
blacks are looked down on 
charles baquet 47 the black us consulgeneral in cape town 
said in the year he has been in south africa he was surprised 
ordinary whites worked to alleviate the effects of apartheid 
and he said he gets angry every time he visits black townships 
neither soweto outside johannesburg nor crossroads a 
shantytown near cape town are anything like harlem he said 
these ghettos were contrived with forethought someone here 
thought about the worst living conditions you could put black 
people in and created them 
mrs nealy 30 says south africa is similar to the united 
states 25 years ago and she worries about street crime but she 
and her husband have applied for permanent residence 
as soon as their accents reveal their nationality black 
americans may be treated as oddities or celebrities 
grigg 26 who is working in south africas secondhighest court 
under a research grant from a us human rights institute says the 
attention he received as one of only three blacks on the aircraft 
flying to south africa was annoying 
miss ginsburg who grew up in thunder bay ont and ann arbor 
mich had wanted to visit south africa since she was 13 
i knew i had to come and live here and experience it as a 
black person not just as an observer said the university of 
michigan and loyolamarymount graduate 
but miss ginsburg 26 is treated as colored a person of 
mixedrace because of her light complexion that to me is most 
painful the divide between black and colored she said 
storekeepers wait on her before south african blacks 
coloreds tell her they are not black and black people react 
warily when she greets them on the street 
mrs nealy went to a segregated school in lamarque texas and 
her children 9 and 13 attend a private multiracial school she 
said she has difficulty dealing with south african racism 
ive had to pray about it a lot color is a big issue 
here she said i guess the freedom to feel at ease to go 
different places i miss that theres racism in the states as 
well but its very subtle 
at the same time black south africans seem a bit standoffish 
at first and dont seem to take it too well that she and her 
husband charles cannot speak an african language she said 
mrs nealy and grigg say they feel tension although life seems 
normal and they are amazed at the lack of communication and 
interaction between the races 
everyone interviewed said they had expected more violence in 
south africa 
people in the us think that as the sun sets there are 
running racial battles in the streets that most whites are 
unfeeling said baquet from new orleans la 
but im working with basically white middleclass groups on a 
project in the tough part of cape town trying to open a day care 
center and rehabilitation center for black children with 
disabilities he said 
miss ginsburg who works for koinonia a church organization 
that runs programs in which blacks teach whites about social 
economic and political issues said the fact that everything is 
so wellcontrolled shows that the state of emergency is so 
effective 
grigg also a university of michigan graduate from tucson 
ariz said he was startled by the lack of knowledge most white 
people have of black life in south africa 
he found being mistaken for a south african black and not 
understanding local languages can have its advantages 
while visiting a small town he and a friend stopped at a store 
for directions and cold drinks and grigg leaned on the counter 
grigg said the white owner trying to tell him he was lazy had to 
repeat the insult in three languages until grigg understood 
but the feelings cannot always be laughed off he said 
its like an assault on your senses on a daily basis an 
assault on your sense of justice on your sense of humanity said 
grigg its not just the big things when someone says something 
to you sometimes its just the look in a childs face

caught between the burgeoning cost of 
statemandated social programs and the legacy of the proposition 13 
tax revolt some officials in rural butte county think bankruptcy 
may be their only answer 
budget cuts have forced the county to release inmates from 
overcrowded jails curtail office hours and cut the sheriffs 
department in half despite a fourfold increase in the countys 
population 
understaffed libraries may have to close soon but officials 
have made room in the budget for one new expense hiring a team of 
bankruptcy lawyers 
weve cut and bled every year and literally dismantled our 
government until we got to this point says supervisor karen 
vercruse 
at some point the whole thing starts to melt down county 
administrator will randolph said were there were down to that 
point 
many of the states other 57 counties read their future in the 
problems of butte county an area 150 miles northeast of sacramento 
rich in gold mining lore forests and fertile farmland but also 
home to widespread poverty 
the danger is that butte county is the precursor of all the 
other counties said dan wall lobbyist for the county 
supervisors association of california we think its a real 
danger a real possibility 
counties complain that the state continually shorts them on 
funding to pay for welfare health court and other services they 
are required to provide while inflation erodes property tax rates 
that were frozen by the proposition 13 taxpayer revolt of 1978 
facing a 3 million deficit on its 128 million budget butte 
county got shortterm relief sept 18 when gov george deukmejian 
agreed to defer a 28 million billing for fire services 
in exchange for the deferment the county consented to a state 
audit 
but without a longterm solution reforms in the funding of 
californias counties a state takeover of some county duties or 
both butte county officials say theyll have to pay back the 
state and only be worse off 
deukmejian has attacked local governments for blaming their 
budget cuts on the state some officials predict the results of the 
audit will force the state to acknowledge that counties have been 
chronically underfunded 
it cant be written off to something such as mismanagement or 
somebodys not doing their job says pat chartrand consultant to 
state sen jim nielsen who represents butte county 
the counties face more and more obligations and not renough 
revenue chartrand said 
county officials were considering bankruptcy before the fire 
bill deferment their decision on whether to declare bankruptcy in 
the future may hinge on any action the state takes in response to 
the audit as well as to possible action by the legislature when it 
returns from recess in january officials said 
oroville at the foot of the sierra nevada in the northern 
sacramento valley was settled by miners in the 1849 gold rush and 
is named after the spanish word for gold 
but it is the lure of cheaper housing that is drawing a new wave 
of lowincome immigrants from cities to butte county and other 
unincorporated areas swelling welfare rolls and the demand for 
other services 
butte county whose 23 percent property tax rate is the states 
second lowest after orange county has been particularly hurt by 
proposition 13 
since the initiatives passage randolph said the countys 
revenues have grown just 26 percent while inflation has risen 48 
percent and costs of mandated programs jumped 261 percent 
meanwhile the countys population of 40000 has grown to 
170000 and county costs for general assistance welfare grants 
increased from 100000 a year in 198182 to 24 million this 
year he said 
the sheriffs department staff has been reduced from 50 patrol 
officers to 24 with roundtheclock shifts there are nights where 
there are only two deputies to patrol the entire county roughly 
2000 square miles randolph said 
jailers must release inmates weekly to meet a court order 
governing the population of the countys overcrowded jail five 
library branches will close sept 30 unless volunteers agree to run 
them randolph said 
len fulton chairman of the board of supervisors said he 
reached the conclusion in 1985 that his county was dying 
ive often said if we were a corporation here we probably 
would have filed for chapter 11 moments after i got on this board 
which was 7 years ago

the author of a senatepassed measure to end 
free mass mailings for lawmakers says the house is taking a 
deceitful path by voting to save the constituent newsletters 
sen pete wilson rcalif said thursday he hopes the senate 
will not follow the house and reverse a prior vote to virtually 
eliminate the favorite perk of incumbents 
the house reversing a decision it made three days before voted 
274137 on thursday for a conference report that would save the 
mass mailings the compromise also would cut the frequency of 
mailings in half six to three annually 
the house had voted 245137 monday to instruct its members of 
the housesenate conference committee to back wilsons plan to 
virtually eliminate mass mailings and give the estimated 45 
million savings to the war on drugs 
the conferees two hours after the house vote ignored both that 
instruction and the 838 senate vote sept 7 for wilsons antimail 
language 
the senate still must approve the compromise and wilson heaping 
scorn on the house urged colleagues not to buckle under 
he complained that house members in one breath openly voted to 
ban newsletters but then with flagrant hypocrisy voted to accept a 
meaningless compromise that will allow the continued gross abuse 
of the free mail to their constituents 
i hope and trust the senate will not follow the same deceitful 
path of the house he added 
rep vic fazio dcalif author of the compromise said 
negotiators knew members wanted to save the newsletters and 
privately thanked him for doing so he said the grateful house 
members included 14 republicans who had voted to stop the mailings 
on monday 
several house members warned that if the senate doesnt accept 
the compromise they would introduce legislation to stop senators 
from using campaign contributions for office expenses the house is 
prohibited by its rules from such use of campaign funds 
rep david obey dwis urged members before the vote to end 
what he called an act of hypocrisy in the house 
if you belong here you would have guts enough to vote today 
publicly the way you talk privately when the vote machine is 
turned off obey said if you cant do that you ought to go 
home and stay home 
the mailing was part of the appropriations bill that would run 
congressional operations for fiscal 1990 at a cost of 19 billion 
of that figure 317 million would pay for mailings the 
remainder of this year 
starting jan 1 when the reduced mailings would take effect 
the legislation would spend 545 million for house mailings 65 
percent of the total and 293 million for senate mailings the 
house mailings would be reduced 32 percent and the senates 14 
percent from original estimates

the splinters of what used to be a 
mahogany altar lay under a gaping hole in the ceiling of the 
cathedral of st luke and st paul a roman revival structure built 
in 1815 and slammed by hurricane hugo 
a big chunk of the roof on the peachcolored church had been 
peeled away exposing naked rafters and sending stone supports 
crashing down on the altar 
its just been crushed you couldnt do anything but cry 
said the very rev nelson koscheski the episcopal churchs dean 
the cathedral adorned with white columns and archways was one 
of 20 to 30 historic buildings in charleston destroyed or severely 
damaged by hurricane hugos 135 mph fury on sept 21 officials 
said 
with damage to about 75 percent of the 3500 buildings 
considered to be of historical significance charleston officials 
have sent out an sos to craftsmen around the country requesting 
their help in healing a wounded city 
other than the loss of life the real tragedy from hugo is the 
architectural loss said randolph martz an architectural 
historian 
lawrence walker executive director of the historic charleston 
foundation estimated the toll will be in the hundreds of millions 
of dollars and that it would take five years to undo the havoc 
caused by hugos winds or the rains that fell two days after the 
storm 
this city is a national treasure thats been badly hurt these 
buildings are the whole flavor of the city we are wounded 
walker said but we are not dead 
some of the structures in this 319yearold port city date back 
to the 1690s the pastel mansions churches and offices also date 
from the federal antebellum and postcivil war periods 
tourists flock to admire terracotta ornaments delicate iron 
lacework cornice details and balustrade railings along with the 
intricate plasterwork and ornate furnishings inside 
one week after hugo struck a bullseye on charleston crews 
toiled to cover holes with tarp and plastic or secure loose brick 
these buildings are like works of art what the storm did 
would be the same thing as slashing a painting for crushing a 
statue martz said 
the city has set up a hotline for suppliers and contractors and 
it received 122 calls in a 24hour period ending thursday artisans 
from massachusetts and illinois have arrived as have 
preservationists from the american institute of architects the 
national park service and historical societies in virginia 
pennsylvania maryland georgia and north carolina 
the city is in dire need of slate for roofs artisans who can 
work with mortar originally mixed with horse hair or ashes and 
plasterers capable of working intricate patterns 
our biggest problem is being able to secure the right 
craftsmen said connie wyrick spokeswoman for the historic 
charleston foundation 
she also urged residents not to settle too quickly with 
insurance companies who might want to put an asphalt roof instead 
of a slate one on a damaged building the city has a strict 
preservation law that dictates even the pastel colors a house may 
be painted 
weve got an outdoor museum here this isnt tract housing in 
kansas wyrick said preservation is part of the mindset of 
this city 
the historic heart of the city sits on a peninsula like a tongue 
of land sticking out into charleston harbor over 100 of its 
buildings have survived british occupation during the revolutionary 
war the union bombardment in the civil war earthquakes in 1886 
and 1893 fires tornadoes and now a killer hurricane 
hugo was like a malicious vandal said charles chase the 
city architect and preservation officer whose 1895 victorian frame 
house was squashed into rubble by the storm this town is not 
immune to destructive forces this is the most recent and 
destructive it has ever faced 
charleston always survives come hell or high water life goes 
on well come back said barbara simmons 50 who rode out the 
storm in a picturesque brick home built in 1840 whose doorway bears 
an odd angle from the 1886 earthquake 
contributions for the restoration of the historic homes are 
being accepted by the historic charleston foundation disaster fund

president bush reaffirming confidence in 
colombian president virgilio barcos fight against drug lords says 
he wants to reopen talks on coffee export prices and launch other 
economic measures to help bolster the south american nations 
economy 
bush told barco on thursday that the united states wants 
colombia to get sufficient economic aid as his embattled government 
faces up to drug traffickers who have declared all out war white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
barco saw bush at the white house before traveling to new york 
to address the united nations today 
us trade representative carla hills will head an interagency 
effort to examine urgently what can be done on trade relations to 
boost us benefits to colombia particularly with agricultural and 
manufactured items fitzwater said in a written statement 
bush also told barco the united states will work with the 
international financial institutions to support increased economic 
assistance for colombia the statement said 
bush wants to resolve fundamental problems with the 
nowdefunct international coffee agreement that led him last week 
to turn down barcos request for an extension of that pact to 
benefit colombian coffee growers fitzwater said 
at a photo session in the rose garden before their 1hour 
meeting barco told reporters he was not seeking any more us 
military aid beyond the 65 million package bush ordered this 
summer 
we are not asking for more assistance we have received 
help with our problem he said without elaboration 
fitzwater said bush told barco he would encourage other 
countries to support colombias efforts against the cocaine cartels 
in august bush ordered the pentagon to sent 65 million in 
military equipment weapons and supplies to help colombian security 
forces bush is requesting some 90 million more from congress for 
the next fiscal year 
some colombian officials have criticized the aid package as not 
suited to their needs they said they need police equipment to 
track down the traffickers while the us aid is primarily 
military equipment such as helicopters and other troop transport 
vehicles 
joining bush for the meeting with barco were bushs top drug 
policy advisers drug policy coordinator william bennett attorney 
gen dick thornburgh chief of staff john sununu deputy secretary 
of state lawrence eagleburger and national security adviser brent 
scowcroft 
barco also met thursday with bennett under tight security at the 
colombian ambassadors residence 
administration officials previously have said bush is willing to 
discuss the coffee import matter even as he turned down barcos 
request to reinstate an export quota system that helped colombian 
coffee growers 
the president indicated his intention to work closely with 
president barco to expand bilateral trade and investment 
opportunities in order to spur colombias economic growth 
fitzwater said 
colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74nation 
international coffee agreement collapsed in july after the united 
states pulled out in a price dispute with coffeeproducing nations 
the agreement had set quotas for member nations exports aimed at 
supporting prices of beans at 120 per pound or more the united 
states wanted an increase in export quotas for higherquality 
coffees enjoyed by us consumers 
colombian officials have suggested it will be difficult to 
convince farmers to grow coffee instead of coca for lucrative 
cocaine production if coffee export prices continue to slip 
bush in a letter to barco last week said the united states was 
ready to negotiate for a new quota system but would not adhere to 
the nowdefunct agreement 
barcos visit to the united states came against a backdrop of 
almost daily terrorist bombings attributed to drug lords in his 
country since barco ordered emergency measures to crack down on 
the drug traffickers following the aug 18 assassination of a 
leading presidential candidate police say eight people have been 
killed and 37 injured in the widespread explosions 
since 1981 about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been 
killed in attacks believed carried out by drug traffickers

portauprince haiti ap lt gen prosper avril offered his 
sympathy to strikers who shut the country down for a day over 
economic austerity measures required by international lenders 
but avril said thursday that haiti had no choice but to 
negotiate with the international monetary fund for a 265 million 
standby loan 
we had a knife to our throat avril said in an interview 
broadcast by the roman catholic churchs radio soleil 
the 24hour general strike closed all businesses and most 
factories on wednesday and paralyzed all public transportation in 
portauprince and virtually the entire nation of 6 million 
the strike was a success avril said i would have gone on 
strike too because i dont agree with everything they the imf 
demanded i dont agree with the monetary fund deal i dont agree 
with poverty i dont agree with insecurity 
the strike was called by 32 leftist and conservative political 
and labor groups and had the tacit support of the chamber of 
commerce and the haitian association of industrialists 
the groups called for withdrawal of last months austerity 
measures including a tariff increase on imports and a lowering of 
the ceiling on taxable businesses to include those that earn as 
little as 25000 a year 
the measures were an attempt to increase government revenue 
curb a deficit that has reached about 60 million this year and 
reduce haitis 800 million foreign debt three times this 
impoverished caribbean nations annual budget 
the strikers also demanded a price cut for food staples and 
respect for human rights

from the side of her husbands casket imelda 
marcos pledged to return ferdinand e marcos body to his homeland 
for burial despite philippine and us government orders barring 
such a move 
this is so cruel so inhuman and so immoral mrs marcos 
told reporters thursday night in the living room of the hillside 
home where the former philippine president and his wife lived 
during most of their 3year exile 
she said there were no immediate plans for burial and an aide 
suggested that barring their return to the philippines marcos 
remains might be above ground for a long time 
marcos 72 died thursday at st francis medical center after 
nearly 10 months in the hospital doctors said kidney and lung 
failure and a widespread infection contributed to cardiac arrest 
that caused his death 
his successor corazon aquino refused to allow marcos body to 
return to his homeland for burial in the interest of the 
tranquility of the state and the order of society 
mrs aquino ordered philippine flags flown at halfmast until 
sunday on all government buildings out of respect for marcos 
later thursday the federal aviation administration in 
washington prohibited any aircraft from flying marcos remains out 
of the united states for the philippines saying it would create 
a danger to the safety of the aircraft and the persons involved 
but mrs marcos dismissed that rationale with a gesture toward 
her husbands open casket in the living room of the familys 
mansion 
how can you feel this man is dangerous to security when he is 
resting at peace forever she said 
marcos his face clearly visible beneath a pane of glass was 
dressed in an offwhite filipino shirt called a barong tagalog the 
casket was draped with a philippine flag and the presidential seal 
of the philippines was mounted on the wall behind the casket 
about two dozen mourners wept and prayed in the living room van 
loads of flowers arrived throughout the day 
mrs marcos clad in black told reporters marcos had left his 
estate to the philippine people she did not elaborate and attorney 
john bartko would not comment on the bequest 
mrs marcos 60 said she had made no funeral plans she said 
she would not consider burying marcos in the united states while 
she had hope mrs aquino would change her mind 
i have always considered that his wish and every filipinos 
wish is to be laid to rest in the philippines mrs marcos said 
i continue to believe that sooner or later he will be 
burial in the us will be considered like turning off the 
life support systems family spokesman roger peyuan said she 
will decide that at the last minute 
marcos mother who died in may 1988 has been embalmed several 
times and lies unburied in the philippines because marcos was not 
allowed into the country for her funeral 
marcos ruled the philippines for more than 20 years before being 
ousted in february 1986 by a popular insurrection that placed mrs 
aquino in power mrs aquinos government has survived six armed 
attempts to overthrow it many by officers formerly loyal to marcos 
mrs marcos said she would continue to defend her husband 
against allegations he stole as much as 10 billion from the 
impoverished archipelago and stashed the money abroad in bank 
accounts property and extravagant purchases 
we are not guilty said mrs marcos who pleaded innocent to 
federal racketeering charges in a new york court last october and 
is free on 5 million bail 
marcos failing health prevented him from being tried 
peyuan said the marcos home would remain open to mourners 24 
hours a day until sunday then his body will be taken to a local 
mortuary for viewing through thursday

a leader of the 14party coalition 
opposing the sandinista government said he dropped out of the bloc 
because leftists in the organization want to limit the number of 
candidates his party can field 
today is the deadline by which candidates must register for the 
february elections but 24 hours before the cutoff the national 
opposition union was still debating which parliamentary seats each 
member party could run for 
mauricio diaz president of the peoples social christian party 
said the coalition offered his party an unacceptable two 
candidacies while the communist and socialist parties were offered 
six seats each 
diaz said his party was the fourth largest votegetter in the 
1984 elections while the communists were fifth and the socialists 
sixth 
leftist parties within coalition have too much influence and 
great power diaz said at the news conference 
but a spokesman for the opposition union said thursday that 
highranking members of diazs party denied there was a split in 
ranks 
the coalitions political council is in session right now 
and the executive commission of the peoples social christian party 
is in the meeting union spokesman luis sanchez said after diaz 
announced his decision 
they insist that the party as such will maintain itself within 
coalition and that if diaz is breaking away hes doing so on his 
own sanchez said 
violeta barrios de chamorro publisher of the opposition 
newspaper la prensa and virgilio godoy are the coalitions 
presidential and vice presidential candidates for the feb 25 
elections 
mrs chamorro and godoy are running against president daniel 
ortega and vice president sergio ramirez of the sandinista national 
liberation front which has held power for a decade 
diaz told reporters his party would support erick ramirez the 
presidential candidate of the splinter social christian party 
diazs party has six deputies in the national assembly and is the 
thirdlargest opposition party in the countrys singlechamber 
legislature 
the current national assembly has 96 deputies 
according to the nicaraguan constitution the assembly has 90 
seats but defeated presidential candidates are guaranteed one 
place each and six candidates ran aginst the sandinistas in 1984 
elections 
besides the opposition coalition and the sandinista front at 
least six parties are running presidential candidates in next 
years vote 
the choice of godoy as the vice presidential candidate four 
weeks ago created a crisis in the coalition because some parties 
favored a conservative businessman godoy was eventually accepted 
but not before some parties had threatened to break away

the bush administrations new steel import 
restrictions probably will work for a while but the program may 
never attain its goal of ending unfair steel trading practices 
overseas a labor leader says 
the administration is completing hurried negotiations and 
expects to reach its deadline of having a new steel import 
restraint program with 29 nations in place by sunday a top trade 
official said thursday 
there will be a steel program as of oct 1 deputy us 
trade representative linn williams told a conference of steel 
manufacturers we may have some cleanup to do after sept 30 but 
we will have a new program oct 1 
the program will replace a series of fiveyear reagan 
administration steel trade pacts that expire saturday the 
scaleddown bush version will last 2 years 
the goal is to give domestic firms continued breathing space 
from imports by placing new productbyproduct caps on the volume 
of steel products shipped into the united states 
the bush administration also is asking nations to commit to 
steps designed to remove government steel subsidies or other free 
trade barriers by march 31 1992 
steel labor is backing the bush program but has expressed doubts 
about whether a meaningful consensus on free trade can be achieved 
we have many reservations about whether thats possible 
said united steelworkers president lynn williams who is not 
related to his bush administration namesake 
williams said the pacts may work for a while but after they 
expire import pressure may again begin to build

a grand canyon sightseeing plane that 
crashed on a landing approach killing 10 people touched down hard 
and scraped its right wing then veered off and rolled nearly 180 
degrees before smashing into a stand of trees federal officials 
said 
investigators are checking to see if the crash was related to 
another landing problem seven months ago in the same aircraft a de 
havilland dhc6 twin otter said john lauber of the national 
transportation safety board in that incident the planes wing 
also struck the ground 
clearly as we get further into this and are able to examine 
whatever other information we can find out about that thats a 
possibility but at this point we have nothing to tie those 
together lauber said thursday 
preliminary results indicate the planes two engines were 
accelerating when the crash occurred lauber said but he refused 
to speculate whether the pilot was trying to abort the landing and 
regain altitude 
weather was not a factor in the crash at the grand canyon 
airport he said 
tests of the pilots blood and fuel analyses were incomplete 
federal aviation administraton records show the 14yearold 
plane had a problem while landing at the airport on feb 27 when 
it lost directional control and struck a wingtip on the runway the 
records said the plane had a possible nosewheelcentering 
problem 
no one was injured in the earlier accident in which wind was 
listed as a contributing factor according to the faa records 
the earlier flight was piloted by a new employee who was being 
supervised by william welch of sedona ariz the pilot killed in 
wednesdays crash said ronald l warren vice president and 
general manager of grand canyon airlines 
welch 47 and copilot keith crosson 43 of kailuakona 
hawaii were killed along with eight passengers 
three survivors were in serious condition one was in guarded 
condition and seven were in stable condition thursday at flagstaff 
medical center about 75 miles away 
it all happened in a flash said katherine mayes who 
suffered a broken pelvis and a severely bruised right shoulder ms 
mayes described how the plane shot straight up and flipped over 
she said she looked out the nearby window and found herself in 
the middle of a pine forest inside the wreckage she saw a woman 
hanging upside down in her seat and other passengers entangled in 
the debris 
i crawled as far away as i could said ms mayes 66 of 
nashville tenn and i waited for the medics im sure they got 
there as fast as they could but it seemed an eternity 
lauber said the plane was returning to the airport 10 miles 
south of the south rim after an aerial tour of the grand canyon 
the faa tower had cleared the landing and everything appeared to 
be normal lauber said 
as the plane touched down however the right wingtip struck the 
runway and the landing was hard enough on the right side to put 
scrub marks on the right tire 
the craft soared and rolled so that its left wing was nearly 
vertical to the ground it struck a stand of ponderosa pine 300 
yards off the pavement 
lauber said transcripts of radio communication between air 
traffic controllers and the pilot revealed nothing unusual there 
were a couple of unintelligible transmissions after the final 
clearance to land was given that sound experts were scrutinizing 
for clues 
lauber said the engines would be removed and shipped to montreal 
for examination by pratt amp whitney the manufacturer 
welch had worked 3 years for the airline and logged about 2000 
hours of flight time lauber said crosson was in his first year 
with the airline

mikhail baryshnikov the sovietborn ballet 
star has resigned abruptly as artistic director of the american 
ballet theater in a dispute with the companys management 
baryshnikov resigned thursday after the board refused to rescind 
a decision by the companys new executive director to place an 
assistant to baryshnikov on a years leave of absence 
baryshnikov who defected from the soviet union in 1974 had 
announced in june he planned to resign from the abt in 1990 to 
further personal endeavors including an acting career 
jane hermann the new executive director said in a letter 
wednesday that the former star of the sovet unions kirov ballet 
gave the company an ultimatum 
the dispute also involved financial problems and baryshnikovs 
refusal to sponsor fundraising efforts for the institute the new 
york times said today 
the abt had a 1 million operating deficit during the summer 
and 15 million was chopped from the companys budget at 
wednesdays board meeting 
baryshnikov who does not receive a salary at abt said in a 
letter written monday by his manager edgar vincent that the 
removal of his assistant charles france infringed on his artistic 
authority france has been reported ill 
if the board sanctions the decision to sever relations with 
charles then it must realize that mishas association with abt 
will cease as of today vincent said in the letter referring to 
baryshnikov by his nickname 
ms hermann said she had asked france to complete the final year 
of his contract on leave at full salary and benefits but he 
continued to do work for the company 
this request was totally ignored and he france continued to 
pursue business on behalf of the company which was inconsistent 
with the artistic and financial planning which i was attempting to 
implement the washington post reported hermanns letter said 
this caused us to work at crosspurposes she said 
baryshnikov also threatened to withdraw the ballets he staged if 
the casts he directed during his tenure are not used 
im not taking orders from anyone especially unfair ones 
he told the times in an interview i left one country for those 
very reasons

a man who spent 18 months in jail for having 
illicit sex with his exwife is suing for custody of their two 
sons claiming she exposed them to bad influences 
i feel like i can give them a better life offer them more 
love and security said james david moseley i dont want them 
in any kind of environment that would not be good for them 
in the lawsuit filed thursday moseley said his former wife has 
exposed the children to influences which are extremely 
detrimental to their wellbeing and best interest 
no further details of the lawsuit were immediately available 
the childrens mother bette lee roberts was awarded custody of 
their sons when the couples divorce became final in april 1988 
neither ms roberts nor her attorney could be reached for 
comment thursday 
moseley originally was charged with rape and sexual assault he 
was acquitted of those charges but was found guilty of the lesser 
charge of oral sodomy under a 156yearold georgia law 
he was released aug 30 on appeal and a judge later overturned 
the conviction the judge ruled that georgias sodomy law cannot be 
applied to consenting married adults 
moseley a 35yearold carpenter has not seen his sons daryl 
gene 4 and mark warren 2 since his imprisonment he said he 
will not fight to deny ms roberts visitation rights 
during his trial moseley testified that he believed his wife 
had the sexual assault charges filed partly because she wanted to 
sabotage his plans to seek custody of the boys

the largest group of jewish refugees to come to 
the united states in a single day in more than 40 years landed in 
time to celebrate the jewish new year here 
kennedy international airport was the scene of emotional 
reunions thursday as the soviet refugees including 1350 jews and 
250 pentecostal and evangelical christians arrived to take 
advantage of a processing policy that ends at midnight tonight 
the agencies that assist jewish refugees decided to stop the 
flow early out of respect for rosh hashanah which begins at 
sundown tonight and ends sunday 
rosh hashanah represents a new beginning for every jew but 
expecially for these people said karl zukerman executive 
director of the hebrew immigrant aid society who spent most of the 
day greeting the new arrivals 
i dreamed of this day for a long time said zena gadelova 
as she embraced her four younger brothers whom she hadnt seen in 
five years they arrived with 17 other relatives including wives 
children and inlaws 
new us policies will mean longer waits for soviet emigrants at 
a time when the soviet union is allowing record numbers to leave 
last year 18965 jews emigrated up from 8155 in 1987 this year 
that number is expected to near 50000 
instead of being processed in europe as in the past the 
refugees paperwork will be handled at the american embassy in 
moscow the same as other wouldbe emigrants 
many of the arriving refugees thursday had been among 14000 
soviet jews waiting in rome for final processing it was the 
largest number of jewish immigrants to arrive in the united states 
on a single day since the end of world war ii 
mikhail sukhar of moscow said he had given up hope of getting 
out of rome before the deadline after his first application to 
enter the united states was denied i didnt even reapply but 
they said i could go 
us officials have said they will continue to review the 
applications of soviet refugees already waiting in rome and vienna 
since the early 1970s both jews and christians who wanted to 
leave moscow applied for israeli visas at the dutch embassy which 
performed consular functions for israel in moscow 
they would then proceed to vienna or rome where as many as 90 
percent of the soviet jews expressed a desire to go to the united 
states their applications almost automatically were approved by 
us immigration officials 
the israeli government has asked the united states to change the 
policy in the hope of attracting more soviet jews to settle in 
israel but state department officials deny the policy change was 
at israels behest

boston ap a judge lifted a 22yearold ban of a film 
depicting atrocities at a state mental asylum with the condition 
that the filmmaker blur the faces of inmates who prefer their grim 
treatment remain a secret 
judge andrew gill meyers ruling thursday released the 1967 
documentary titicut follies by frederick wiseman an 
awardwinning director known for his stark potrayal of subjects 
like hospitals racetracks and the men whose fingers are on the 
buttons that fire nuclear missiles 
the 85minute black and white film depicts the moldering often 
cruel conditions at bridgewater state hospital for the criminally 
insane built in 1852 and replaced with new buildings since the 
films production 
many scenes depict nude men in bare cells being baited by 
sadistic guards one man is shown being force fed as he lies on a 
table and a liquid is poured down a rubber hose shoved into his 
nose the film has no narrator 
it was ordered withheld from the public six weeks after its new 
york debut on grounds it violated the privacy of the 62 featured 
inmates 
in his ruling meyer said that inmates who still wish to remain 
anonymous or those who are incompetent to judge must appear with 
their faces blurred 
in reconsidering the ban meyer solicited comments from the 
inmates portrayed in the film many of whom have died or could not 
be located the judge said seven of 20 inmates located were 
competent to decide whether they wanted their identities masked 
some of those who appear in the film dont want to revisit the 
dehumanization they endured but others say the abuse they suffered 
must be exposed 
to me it was like a concentration camp said vladimir 
semyonov 51 who spent eight years at bridgewater and now bags 
groceries and lives in brockton 15 miles south of boston 
im glad theyre showing the film i want to expose the 
state said semyonov he said the film may make the public take 
some interest in conditions at state hospitals 
imposing the ban two decades ago judge harry kalus labeled the 
film a nightmare of ghoulish obscenities 
his ban against which wiseman began fighting two years ago 
wasnt total kalus allowed the film to be shown to members of 
interested professions and the film has been shown regularly to 
psychology students lawyers social workers and journalists 
in his ruling meyer tried to resolve the conflict between the 
films potential to embarrass its subjects and the filmmakers 
right for his work to be shown 
i have viewed the film and agree that it is a substantial and 
significant intrusion into the privacy of the inmates shown in the 
film the judge wrote 
however i also regarded titicut follies as an outstanding 
film artistically and thoughtfully edited with great social and 
historical value another observation about the film it is 
true 
state officials have said that since the film was made 
conditions at bridgewater have been improved with a better trained 
staff and a smaller population 
the film has been credited by some with forcing improvements at 
asylyms 
mitchell sikora a boston attorney who was appointed by the 
court to interview 17 of the 20 located inmates shown in the 
documentary said thursday he would need more time to assess the 
effect of the ruling 
neither wiseman a cambridgebased filmmaker nor his attorney 
returned telephone calls from the associated press

jews throughout israel today began their 
celebration of rosh hashana the jewish new year with prayers 
picnics and tight security 
the beginning of the hebrew year will not be marked by blowing 
the traditional rams horn or shofar in israels 8000 synagogues 
because the holiday falls on the jewish sabbath when it is 
forbidden to sound the horn 
instead the shofar will be blown on the second day of the new 
year festival sunday 
the new year 5750 was interpreted by some religious scholars as 
the year of miracles because 50 stands for the letter n in 
hebrew the scholars linked the n to the word nisim or 
miracle 
but some newspapers interpreted the new year as the root to the 
word tashan or sleep suggesting weariness over the 21month 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of the territories 
at least 575 arabs have been killed by israeli troops and 
civilians during the revolt forty israelis also have been slain in 
the violence 
to prevent the uprising from interfering in the holiday the 
army blocked travel into israel by residents of the gaza strip 
until monday morning and increased searches of palestinians 
entering from the west bank 
overnight police in israels galilee rounded up 105 
palestinians who broke the law prohibiting residents of the 
territories from spending the night in israel 
the army also increased patrols along the lebanese and jordanian 
borders and police were reinforced throughout the country to head 
off possible guerrilla attacks 
we want not only to ensure a feeling of safety but to let the 
people of israel celebrate as they choose police commissioner 
david krauss said on israel radio 
rosh hashana is celebrated on the first and second day of the 
jewish month of tishrei it marks the beginning of the 10 days of 
awe when jews reflect on their deeds of the past year and repent 
for their sins 
the period culminates in the fast of yom kippur the day of 
atonement which comes on oct 9 
tonight the start of the holiday jewish families gather for 
traditional dinners eating apples dipped in honey to signify a 
sweet new year 
ashkenazim or jews of european origin eat a festive meal that 
traditionally includes chopped liver and gefilte fish while 
sephardim jews from the middle east eat couscous and fish heads 
vacationers enjoying a long weekend flocked to beaches in tel 
aviv and other coastal cities taking advantage of sunny skies and 
80degree weather

the young woman said she wanted a 20 rock of cocaine but had no 
money another customer in the bar said the dealer responded i 
sure would like to have a baby boy 
the pair walked outside to complete the deal investigators 
said and the alleged dealer returned to the bar with the baby 
another woman in the bar asked the dealer if she could hold the 
baby and then took it home and called police in the morning mills 
said 
police said it appeared to mark the first report of a kansas 
city baby being traded for drugs although similar deals have been 
reported elsewhere 
i think its a horrendous example of the vulnerability of 
people who are addicted to crack and the extent to which they will 
go mills said

the death rate from cervical cancer which kills 
4500 american women a year is higher in the southeast than in 
other parts of the country federal health officials say 
the disease the risk of which increases with the number of 
sexual partners killed an average of 4543 women each year in the 
period 198486 the us centers for disease control said thursday 
average mortality rates were highest in the southeast from the 
district of columbia to louisiana nine southeastern states and the 
district of columbia were among 13 with annual cervical cancer 
death rates of more than 45 deaths per million women 
the nine states were alabama georgia kentucky louisiana 
mississippi north carolina south carolina tennessee and west 
virginia others were alaska maine and north dakota 
the lowest rates were in utah and wyoming with less than 20 
deaths per year per million women 
compared with other types of cancer the number of cases per 
year is small the cdc said cervical cancer accounts for less 
than 3 percent of us cancer deaths among women lung cancer and 
breast cancer are the chief causes 
nationwide the mortality rate was 37 per million the cdc said 
earlier this year that rate was down 18 percent since 1979 
most women with cervical cancer survive the national cancer 
institute reports that from 197485 67 percent of women with 
cervical cancer were still alive five years after diagnosis 
the atlantabased cdc said certain types of sexually transmitted 
human papillomavirus act as infectious agents possibly increasing 
the risk of cervical cancer another risk factor the cdc said is 
smoking 29 percent of all cervical cancer death is attributable to 
cigarette smoking 
pap tests recommended annually by the american cancer society 
aid in early detection and treatment of cervical cancer the cdc 
said 
a study of cervical cancer cases in rhode island in 1987 found 
five factors contributing to invasive or more serious cervical 
cancer lack of pap tests too long a period between tests rapid 
development of the disease between tests a falsely negative test 
result or lack of treatment following a positive test 
in patients under 40 most patients either experienced rapid 
growth of the disease after a negative test or had a falsely 
negative test result the cdc said among women aged 4069 most 
had waited too long between screenings

north korea called for talks among 
political and social leaders of the two koreas on national 
unification but south korea today rejected the offer as obsolete 
and nothing new 
choi byongbo spokesman for the governments national 
unification board said the proposal is the same one made by the 
norths leader kim il sung in his new year messsage seoul also 
turned down the earlier proposal 
the latest north korean overture broadcast by pyongyang and 
monitored in tokyo on thursday calls for seoul and pyongyang to 
hold a joint meeting of 60 political and social leaders equally 
divided between them on feb 20 next year to work out a new 
unification formula 
the proposal is obsolete and has nothing new in it choi 
said 
north korea in what appeared to be a slight policy change said 
that although it considered its unification formula the most 
effective it also was willing to discuss other measures 
some experts in seoul speculated that pyongyang may be willing 
to modify its longstanding unification formula calling for the two 
koreas to operate as separate states under a confederation seoul 
has rejected this idea 
choi said the norths proposal made by kim yongnam that 
countrys foreign minister is basically the same he said the 
latest north korean proposal is aimed at formenting dissident 
movements in the south 
in the past north korea demanded the convocation of a joint 
meeting of 600 political and social leaders from each side to 
discuss unification but this time it cut the number of delegates 
the spokesman said 
north korea did not specify the qualifications of delegates but 
in the past has said that they should include dissident leaders 
south korean president roh taewoo on sept 11 proposed that 
seoul and pyongyang form a korean commonwealth before 
unification and build up mutual trust north korea immediately 
turned down rohs idea 
also today the south korean government approved a plan by a 
buddhist organization to invite 30 north korean monks and laymen to 
a buddhist lantern festival in seoul next month 
the approval cleared the way for the korea buddhism sect 
council a federation of buddhist orders in south korea to invite 
north korean buddhists to the oct 14 festival in seoul 
it is unclear whether north korea would accept the invitations 
if north korea accepts it would mark the first religious exchange 
between the two koreas 
north and south korea have been bitter rivals since the 
peninsula was divided at the end of world war ii in 1945 they 
fought the 195053 korean war

president bush and the nations 
governors after sealing a social compact to rebuild american 
education now face a more daunting task marshaling educators and 
public support for rigorous standards and radical new ways of 
running schools 
still to come from the governors and the white house in the 
months ahead are the specifics of the first national education 
goals aimed at reducing the steep dropout rate shaping students up 
in math and science reducing adult illiteracy and getting more 
young children physically and mentally fit to begin their education 
but as they headed home thursday from their twoday summit at 
the university of virginia the president and state executives 
agreed that the success of their strategy rests on galvanizing 
public support for what bush termed an america of tougher 
standards 
there were no promissory notes signed but bush did commit 
himself to the principle of targeting any future funding increases 
toward needy preschoolers for both head start health and 
nutrition programs 
bush standing in the sunshine on the lawn outside the thomas 
jeffersondesigned rotunda pledged his determination to follow 
up in every way possible we just cannot let it sit here and end 
here and i promise you that i wont 
earlier in a keynote address bush declared a social compact 
begins today in charlottesville virginia a compact between 
parents teachers principals superintendents state legislators 
governors and the administration 
educational reform is an urgent responsibility for every 
parent every student every community and those who do not 
advance the cause of education hinder it he cautioned 
former education secretary william bennett was rebuked by white 
house chief of staff john sununu for his comment that the 
governors summit debates were full of pap and stuff that 
rhymes with pap displaying a total absence of any knowledge 
about the schools 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said sununu spoke 
for bush when he told bennett now the federal drug policy chief 
thanks for your comments they werent helpful 
gov terry branstad of iowa republican chairman of the national 
governors conference said the consensus among the governors and 
administration officials was that mr bennett went overboard 
and was somewhat flip in his remarks 
for the governors some of whom have spent much of the 1980s 
battling to improve their schools bushs message was music to the 
ears 
california gov george deukmejian lamented that now you dont 
find many parents who even go to open house in the school their 
children are attending its a call to them to get involved 
deukmejian a republican predicted it will take a decade to 
reach the point where american students are getting an education 
thats just as good as students are receiving in countries like 
japan and germany 
ohio gov richard celeste struck one of the few discordant 
notes suggesting bush should scrap three 500 million stealth 
bombers and spend the money on school reforms instead 
but even celeste a democrat acknowledged that stamping the 
white house good housekeeping seal of approval on the reform 
agenda is a plus thats very valuable 
in seeking school restructuring bush and the governors endorsed 
stricter accountability focusing on results rather than on 
compliance with rules and regulations decentralization of school 
authority and decisionmaking and real rewards for teachers 
who succeed with students and real consequences for failure 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said the accord on national goals is potentially a 
major turning point for education in this country 
shanker said bush has embraced a kind of experimentation and 
childoriented approach rather than the rigid conservative 
approach which is to go back to the old system and put the screws 
on 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
said there are no broad goals that we cant work with but he 
predicted it will take some tough discussions to define the 
broad goals outlined at the summit 
a governors task force and administration officials will seek 
to define those goals by the governors regular winter meeting in 
february 
the accord also commits bush and the governors to seek greater 
flexibility and enhanced accountability in federal school aid to 
push state efforts to restructure schools and to report annually 
on progress in achieving our goals 
washington gov booth gardner said we will have a report 
card evaluating not only the schools but how the states and 
washington fulfill their roles 
a happy but weary arkansas gov bill clinton said not only 
are we going to set national performance goals but we stand 
here before you and tell you we expect to be held personally 
accountable

the interior ministry said today it will 
disband the zomo riot police the widely scorned paramilitary units 
long associated with the communist governments repression of 
opposition activists 
the helmeted police with shields and batons were especially 
active following the imposition of martial law in december 1981 
the interior ministry which controls the police is still run 
by the communists one of four cabinet posts retained by the party 
after the formation this month of the east blocs first 
noncommunistled government under prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki 
the decision to disband the zomo was made to save money and 
remove an irritation for society said wojciech garstka a 
ministry spokesman 
the zomo squads will be replaced by special preventive patrol 
units of the civic militia as the police force is called to be 
established in 22 of polands 49 provinces the state pap news 
agency said 
in addition the power to deploy the forces will be removed from 
provincial police chiefs and reserved for the office of the prime 
minister a government presidium or the interior minister at their 
instruction garstka said 
this is one of the most important changes because those troops 
were not bad by themselves but the formula for using them was wrong 
sometimes and this formula is changing the spokesman said 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak had said this month in 
parliamentary hearings that he saw a need for some force trained to 
maintain public order 
we assume at the same time these are indispensible troops 
because some danger for social peace and order will remain at a 
large scale that will have to be approached with mobilized 
troops garstka said i am talking about various big 
events first of all sports events 
according to the interior ministry budget published in early 
september by the liberal communist weekly polityka there were 
12819 positions in the zomo department not counting parttime 
employees and others assigned temporarily including those doing 
mandatory military service the international institute for 
strategic studies put the number of zomo at 28000 
the zomo which stands in polish for motorized units of the 
citizens militia had been used most to disband anticommunist 
demonstrations during the years the government tried to suppress 
solidarity and other opposition groups following martial law on 
dec 13 1981 
the squads would spill out of armored trucks and doublestep in 
ranks the officers hidden behind helmets with face guards and 
large shields alerts of zomo zomo would turn heads of 
protesters and onlookers and send tension through a crowd as the 
troops moved forward to force marchers into retreat 
the zomo have been controlled by kiszczak during his eight years 
as interior minister a post he retained in the new government 
after stepping down as prime minister in august following a futile 
threeweek effort to form a communistled government 
he was the chief negotiater for the communist authorities during 
spring roundtable talks on political and economic reform that 
led to the restoration of solidaritys legal status april 17 
largely democratic elections in june and eventually the creation of 
a solidarityled government

some men are reluctant to admit they read books 
by women writers and criticize their work as being less universal 
than mens authors told the pen international writers association 
writing by men is supposed to be more accessible to the human 
race novelist margaret atwood said about what she sees as the 
prevailing belief 
you dont stop being defensive until you stop being 
attacked she said during a panel discussion thursday 
atwood perhaps canadas best known writer for such bestsellers 
as the handmaids tale and cats eye was one of the most 
prominent critics of the associations 1986 congress in new york 
for not including enough women 
the canadian meeting in montreal and earlier in the week in 
toronto is the first in north america since 1986 organizers made 
an effort to include more women ethnic and minority writers in its 
discussions 
atwood suggested the question might better be examined from the 
other angle 
why dont i like louis lamour westerns she asked 
in one of the livelier sessions atwood joked that men at book 
signings often have told her how much their wives like her work 
what is it that this phrase conceals she said 
atwood said either the men arent reading her books or they 
dont want to admit it possibly for fear of being considered wimps 
although i can report from book signings that more and more 
men are saying this book is for me she said 
pen has some 11000 members in more than 90 chapters worldwide 
organized along language lines it pays special attention to 
freeing writers from prison and to censorship and other threats to 
freedom of expression 
the congress is being held in canada for the first time since 
pens founding in 1921 the englishspeaking canadian chapter 
hosted the first portion in toronto and the frenchspeaking chapter 
is hosting the last days in montreal 
betty friedan the american author and feminist suggested at 
the panel on feminine literature that women must stop being so 
defensive about the female experience 
is war more universal than childbirth she asked maybe it 
is as universal 
at an earlier panel on the writer and the exercise of freedom 
friedan said threats to freedom of expression exist in democracies 
even if they may be more subtle than in authoritarian nations 
i can tell you this from my personal experience as a writer 
and a woman of the last 25 years she said 
friedan noted the difficulties of getting ideas other than the 
prevailing view published or being exposed in the mass media 
subject to marketplace pressures 
there are ways that our freedom is being continuously 
coopted she said and we collude in this 
she said the idea of the new traditionalism that women want 
just their husband children and home seems to be appearing more 
frequently in the mass media 
its something to watch friedan said

britains archbishop of canterbury arrived in rome 
today for four days of talks with pope john paul ii on uniting the 
anglican and roman catholic churches divided since the 16th 
century reformation 
archbishop robert runcie was greeted on arrival at leonardo da 
vinci airport by top vatican officials including cardinal johannes 
willebrands president of the pontifical council for promoting 
christian unity 
in a brief statement runcie said his talks likely would be 
frank but he was confident they would lead to increased 
understanding 
earlier about 20 protesters at londons heathrow airport 
carried signs such as runcie resign and no to papal talks 
as the archbishop departed runcie refused to speak to the group 
runcies secretary for ecumenical affairs canon christopher 
hill said earlier he did not expect immediate union of the 
churches because talks about closer relations have been going 
steadily on for 30 years 
i am sure it will happen eventually because the founder of 
christianity wanted one church he said 
anglican leaders said they thought unity between anglicans and 
catholics would not come until the 21st century 
it will happen eventually cardinal basil hume archbishop 
of westminster and leader of catholics in england and wales said 
in an interview with channel 4 television late thursday 
runcie and john paul have met four times but this is runcies 
first official visit to rome as spiritual head of the state church 
of england he is also the leader of 70 million anglicans 
worldwide including 25 million us episcopalians 
the pope leads 850 million roman catholics 
in rome runcie is expected to discuss the nature of the 
anglican communion and explain how its system of dispersed 
authority gives a measure of equality among church leaders 
the anglican church does not have the vaticans central 
directing authority although its priests look to canterbury for 
guidance 
the anglican freedom allows members such as the us 
episcopalians to ordain woman priests and this year in the boston 
diocese the first anglican woman bishop 
theres no doubt about it and the pope himself has said so 
that the ordination of women and especially the consecration of a 
woman as bishop constitute very considerable difficulties for us 
and also the orthodox church hume said 
anglicans and catholics have discussed for many years how their 
churches might draw closer together 
runcie caused a stir last week by telling an italian journalist 
that the church of england might recognize papal authority in a 
united church a view that had already been stated by the 
commission 
evangelicals in the church of england who base their teaching 
strictly on the bible and oppose unity with rome reacted 
indignantly 
their chief spokesman the rev david samuel said many 
people in the church of england dont want closer ties with the 
church of rome already people are leaving the church of england 
because of the catholicizing tendencies 
runcie said on british broadcasting corp television thursday he 
was looking forward to the visit 
one thing which is at the center of my thoughts and i believe 
at the center of his the popes is that we do have a unity 
already he said we dont have perfect unity but there is 
something we have and sometimes people forget that 
runcie is returning the popes 1982 visit to canterbury 
cathedral the anglican mother church and the seat of the first 
archbishop augustine who arrived in england from rome in 597 
runcie and the pope also met in accra ghana in 1980 and in 
bombay india in 1986 they met again later in that year in 
assisi italy when john paul invited leaders of world religions to 
pray for peace in the city which is the birthplace of st francis 
the first visit to rome by an archbishop of canterbury since the 
reformation was paid by the late geoffrey fisher who met pope john 
xxiii on dec 2 1960 the vatican regarded the meeting as so 
sensitive that it barred photographers 
pope paul vi saw michael ramsey in 1966 and donald coggan in 
1977 
britains king henry viii separated the english from the 
catholic church when the vatican refused to annul his marriage with 
katherine of aragon the 1534 act of supremacy acknowledged the 
king as the only supreme head on earth of the church of england

soldiers and police were on alert 
today and panicselling hit the countrys stock exchanges after 
president corazon aquino banned the burial of ferdinand marcos in 
the philippines 
there was little sign of tension however about 300 marcos 
supporters staged a vigil in front of the armed forces headquarters 
at suburban quezon city in the only rally reported today 
mrs aquino ordered philippine flags flown at halfstaff until 
sunday on government buildings in respect for the 72yearold 
former president who died thursday in hawaii 
but mrs aquino ruled out allowing either marcos remains or 
members of his immediate family to return now because it could 
lead to some destabilization activities a senior official had 
suggested the government might allow marcos ashes to be flown to 
the philippines but mrs aquino said later that was not under 
consideration 
in honolulu marcos wife imelda called mrs aquinos decision 
so cruel so inhuman and so immoral 
also today a senior official said marcos death may encourage 
former associates to help efforts to recover the fortune allegedly 
stolen from the government during the late presidents rule 
security was reinforced today at all radio and television 
stations electric power plants telephone exchanges and other 
essential installations in the manila area 
marcos supporters planned rallies and roman catholic masses in 
manila and other cities but military chief of staff gen renato de 
villa said the situation was calm nationwide and we have not 
seen anything that is abnormal in the country 
marcos supporters including former cabinet members met to plan 
strategy but did not comment later 
marcos loyalists have been blamed for some of the six armed 
attempts to topple mrs aquino since she took power on feb 25 
1986 after a civilianmilitary uprising ended marcos 20year rule 
but rallies by marcos followers have dwindled steadily over the 
past three years most of the recent crowds have numbered only a 
few hundred 
at a news conference today mrs aquino said the return of 
marcos remains might trigger clashes between proandantimarcos 
groups she said officials could lift the ban if conditions in the 
nation improve but gave no timetable 
we believe that allowing the remains of the late president to 
be brought back here would cause some instability and would 
discourage very much investors and tourists from coming here plus 
also dividing the people she said 
mrs aquino said recent opinion polls by the government showed 
public almost equally divided on the issue of marcos burial 
for my part i have forgiven mr marcos she said but it 
is not just a question of forgiving as president of the 
philippines it is my duty to see to it that the security and 
welfare of the filipino people is assured 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the federal aviation administration would seek to prevent any 
flight from carrying marcos body from the united states to the 
philippines 
following a meeting today of the cabinet crisis committee 
national security adviser rafael ileto said the government may send 
a representative to the funeral if marcos is buried in hawaii 
asked if the government was offering the return of marcos ashes 
as one official had indicated mrs aquino said no there is 
absolutely no truth to that i did not even discuss the matter of 
his cremation 
share prices fell today in early trading on the manila and 
makati stock exchanges as retail investors feared marcos death 
would enrage his followers and stir up trouble for the government 
the manila composite stock index of 25 selected issues dropped 
1627 points to 113167 down 14 percent from thursdays close 
but prices began recovering in later trading brokers said 
the philippine government says marcos and his associates 
embezzled up to 10 billion before he was ousted but efforts to 
recover any money have been delayed by legal problems both here 
and in switzerland where the bulk is believed stashed 
we believe that there are cronies who were prevented from 
cooperating with us because offear of the president to whom they 
owe so much said mateo caparas chairman of the presidential 
commission on good government but now for the sake of the 
nationi believe they would voluntarily come to us and tell us 
the truth he said

a man convicted in the grisly 
killing of a schoolteacher was executed today despite last minute 
appeals by the united nations and human rights lawyers in this 
country 
in cape town a prosecutor said two white police riot squad 
members will be charged with assaulting antiapartheid protesters 
as a result of allegations of brutality made by a dissident 
mixedrace officer 
the justice department said mangena jeffrey boesman 36 was 
hanged along with a mixedrace man sentenced in a separate killing 
boesman a black member of the outlawed african national 
congress guerrilla movement was convicted of the 1985 killing of 
mellina fass a black teacher who apparently defied a school 
boycott called by antiapartheid activists 
mrs fass who was in her 50s had a gasolinesoaked tire placed 
around her neck and set alight 
in nationwide unrest from 1984 to 1986 militant antiapartheid 
activists used the necklace to kill dozens of people they 
considered collaborators with the white government 
the un general assembly by a vote of 1490 thursday called 
on south africa to commute the death sentence of boesman and all 
other political prisoners 
the united states and britain abstained us ambassador thomas 
r pickering said washington did not consider boesman a political 
prisoner 
there can be no circumstances in which a violent murder such 
as the one in this case could be considered a rightful 
political act said pickering 
the south african lawyers for human rights who oppose the death 
penalty said they made unsuccessful appeals to the government 
thursday on behalf of boesman and the man executed alongside him 
jacobus freeman 
thirtynine people have been executed in south africa this year 
far fewer than in recent years when more than 100 people were 
hanged annually more than 200 people mostly black men remain on 
death row 
about 40 prisoners have had their death sentences commuted this 
year and now are serving prison terms 
in the police case neil rossouw attorney general for the cape 
town region said maj charles brazelle and lt dj ross would 
appear in court tuesday to plead to assault charges stemming from a 
sept 5 confrontation between police and activists in the 
mixedrace township of mitchells plain 
rossouw said thursday he decided to prosecute after 
investigating complaints by lt gregory rockman who accused riot 
squad members of acting like wild dogs and beating and whipping 
protesters and bystanders 
rockman went public with his allegations sept 6 the day of 
segregated parliamentary elections that excluded the black majority 
he has become a folk hero with many township youths who 
sometimes chant his name at antigovernment rallies 
activists say 23 people were killed in election day violence 
instigated by police in black and mixedrace townships outside cape 
town 
police initially denied responsibility for any deaths however 
they have opened an investigation and now say 19 people were 
killed including 10 who died in blackonblack factional fighting 
and nine in incidents where police may have been involved 
rockman said he welcomed the decision to prosecute but called 
for a broader investigation into alleged police brutality he said 
the sept 5 violence was only one of the complaints that ive 
got 
rockman who met with roussouw thursday has called for the 
resignation of law and order minister adriaan vlok and requested a 
meeting with president fw de klerk

the government for the first 
time is willing to take responsibility for multiracial schools 
either by running them directly or funding them a senior official 
said today 
most public schools would remain segregated but the new 
approach would benefit families in certain urban neighborhoods that 
are in the process of being declared multiracial most of these 
areas have been integrated for years despite laws mandating 
residential segregation 
piet clase minister of white education announced the new 
policy after a meeting thursday with a delegation of people trying 
to prevent the closure of johannesburg girls high school 
enrollment has declined sharply at the whitesonly school and a 
committee of parents teachers and students has campaigned to save 
the facility by opening it to all races 
clase said today the government had a responsibility to provide 
education in socalled free settlement areas the official 
term for neighborhoods that will be designated multiracial 
he said the committee seeking to save johannesburg girls high 
school had two options it could transform the school into a 100 
percent state subsidized private school or it could apply to have 
the schools neighborhood become a free settlement area 
mike ellis education spokesman for the antiapartheid 
democratic party said clases statement represented a dramatic 
shift in policy 
beeld a progovernment newspaper said in an editorial thursday 
that it would make no sense to allow mixed residential areas unless 
the government allowed mixed public schools in those areas 
at present black mixedrace and indian children living in 
multiracial areas must either attend private schools or travel long 
distances to segregated public schools in outlying townships

the number of fema offices in south carolina to better handle the 
crush of applicants for disaster aid the 200 people staffing

up to 10000 for storm victims who cannot qualify for private 
loans

evolution theory would be emphasized 
more than ever in california science classes under a new state 
guideline approved by a blue ribbon panel of educators 
thursdays 60 vote of the science subcommitteeof the state 
curriculum commission sent the new teaching guidelines to the full 
commission if the commission approves the guidelines today as 
expected they will go to the state board of education for a public 
hearing in october and a final vote in november 
science teachers and school administrators who attended the 
subcommittee hearing were unanimous in congratulating the panel for 
the increased emphasis on teaching evolution 
unlike past state hearings on evolution which attracted 
standingroomonly crowds of christian fundamentalists opposed to 
the exclusion of creation theory only one person spoke against the 
proposed new science guidelines 
i am a creationist and i hope creation theory is included 
said ellie hamilton of ripon 
the new guidelines for science teachers and local school 
administrators formally known as the state science curriculum 
framework is a detailed policy statement of what should be taught 
in california schools and how it should be taught 
the frameworks dont mandate course content which is determined 
by the states 1030 elected local school boards but they set 
standards and goals that historically have been nearly as effective 
as mandates 
only four pages of the 187page framework refer to what 
subcommittee chairwoman elizabeth stage of the university of 
california at berkeley calls the controversial topic of 
evolution which is not controversial in the scientific world 
the key provision in the science framework is brief but makes a 
proevolution statement more strongly than any previous california 
education policy guideline has been made 
evolution is the central organizing theory of biology and has 
fundamental importance in other sciences as well it is no more 
controversial in scientific circles than gravity or electricity 
while recognizing the right of individuals to hold and 
practice their own beliefs teachers must not be pressured by 
anyone to distort or suppress science the framework continues 
adding that teachers should feel free to respond sorry but 
thats not a question for science when students raise the 
creation theory 
such questions should be treated with respect and referred to 
family or clergy for further discussion it declares 
curriculum commission chairman daniel chernow of los angeles 
predicted unanimous commission approval

episcopal bishops say they are ready to work 
together to preserve church unity by accommodating sharp 
differences over the ordination of women 
in a statement thursday 182 members of the house of bishops 
affirmed the ministry of women while calling for pastoral 
sensitivity toward those who believe women should not be ordained 
i think there was a real expression in this house for lets 
move on presiding bishop edmond l browning said i dont 
think there was any question about that i think we are ready to 
get on with the mission 
the statement welcomed suffragan bishop barbara c harris of 
massachusetts the first female bishop in the worldwide anglican 
communion but said those within anglicanism who oppose the 
ordination of women hold a recognized theological position 
it also called for following the guidelines of an international 
church commission that this year urged anglicans to live 
together despite differences on matters of faith 
the bishops statement was sent to dr robert ak runcie 
archbishop of canterbury and head of the anglican communion who 
arrived in rome today for a fourday official visit with pope john 
paul ii the meeting is aimed at resolving obstacles to unity 
between the roman catholic and anglican churches 
the statement also will be sent to the primates of the other 26 
provinces in the anglican communion browning said 
traditionalist bishops who met in fort worth texas in june to 
form a church within the church said they were pleased with the 
statement which came at the end of a sixday meeting 
gods hand is in this said fort worth bishop clarence c 
pope what we have done is simply to remove the siege mentality 
our convictions remain the same but weve got an atmosphere now in 
which i think we can actually go forward together without 
compromising our beliefs 
the statement expresses the collective belief of the house but 
holds no canonical authority it was shaped in closed sessions in 
the city where the denomination was organized in 1789 as the first 
free and independent anglican church outside the british isles 
the bishops opted not to issue a pastoral letter which would 
have been required reading in every parish serving the churchs 25 
million members 
ms harris said her reception at the meeting had been 
overwhelmingly affirmative even on the part of some who disagree 
on the ordination of women 
she expressed hope that this would be the last time the house 
will have to deal with this as a public statement

indian peacekeeping forces battled 
tamil guerrillas in northeastern sri lanka killing five militants 
and shattering a 10dayold ceasefire military officials said 
today 
elsewhere at least 14 people died in ethnic violence this week 
despite a truce the army called in its fight against 
antigovernment sinhalese radicals 
military officials who requested anonymity said the indian 
soldiers clashed with tamil guerrillas in the northeastern town of 
mullaitivu on thursday 
five rebels were killed and five wounded they said two indian 
soldiers also were hurt in the first major attack since the 
peacekeeping forces called an indefinite ceasefire sept 20 tamil 
guerrillas agreed to honor the truce 
military officials accused the largest and most militant group 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam of provoking the clash 
india sent 47000 soldiers to sri lanka in july 1987 to enforce 
a peace accord aimed at ending the tamil rebellion the new delhi 
government has said the remaining 42000 troops will be gone by 
dec 31 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people contend they are denied jobs and education by the 
predominantly buddhist sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and military 
india which mediated the peace accord became involved in sri 
lankas ethnic problems because 60 million tamils living in 
southern india sympathize with the rebel cause 
the accord offered the tamils limited autonomy if they abandon 
their demand for an independent homeland in the northeast and 
surrender their weapons the tamil tigers rejected the accord and 
turned their guns on indian soldiers 
the presence of indian troops also triggered a 2yearold 
violent campaign by sinhalese radicals who accused the government 
of offering too many concessions to the minority tamils and 
compromising the countrys sovereignty by inviting foreign troops 
to sri lankan soil

the communist party leader urged chinese to 
defend socialism and ruled out a multiparty system in a nationally 
broadcast speech today marking 40 years of communist rule 
jiang zemins speech in the great hall of the people opened a 
weekend of festivities marking revolutionary leader mao tsetungs 
oct 1 1949 proclamation of the peoples republic of china after 
decades of civil war 
only socialism can save china jiang declared in a speech 
thick with traditional socialist rhetoric and praise for the 
partys crushing of massive studentled prodemocracy protests in 
june 
since then supporters of liberal change have been purged 
including thenparty chief zhao ziyang and hardline attacks on 
capitalism and pluralism such as jiangs speech have become the 
norm 
the capital remains under martial law imposed during the 
protests and public warnings have been issued against any attempt 
by disgruntled participants in the spring movement to sabotage the 
celebrations 
in hong kong today 100 students protesting the crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement clashed with police outside an official 
reception for chinas national day seven policemen were injured 
and four protesters were arrested police said 
hong kong reverts to chinese sovereignty in 1997 many of the 
territorys 57 million people took to the streets during the 
prodemocracy movement to voice their support 
jiang said today that history has proven the socialist system 
has great vigor and vitality the replacement of capitalism with 
socialism is the great historical trend 
calls for a multiparty system he said are extremely 
destructive to our cause and are liable to be exploited by a 
small handful of reactionaries one cannot oppose socialism and 
be patriotic he said 
people of all nationalities and all party members especially 
leaders must maintain a high degree of vigilance he said 
referring not to any military threat but to western liberal ideas 
that might undermine the partys power he reiterated the partys 
accusation since june that western nations seek to stimulate a 
peaceful evolution in china away from socialism 
a return to capitalism he said would give rise to a 
capitalist class by fattening it with the sweat and toil of the 
laboring people and reduce most chinese to extreme poverty 
jiang stood with his arms firmly planted on each side of the 
podium and his head down as he plowed through the 80minute 
midafternoon speech 
the speech televised live and immediately reported by the 
official xinhua news agency was before an invited audience of more 
than 10000 made up of top party and government leaders model 
workers and soldiers they applauded briefly 14 times cued each 
time when jiang raised his voice in a flourish and then paused 
foreign reporters were not allowed to attend 
xinhua later praised jiang for his penetrating analysis of 
issues facing the party 
senior leader deng xiaoping whom jiang praised as the mainstay 
of the party did not attend the speech in keeping with his habit 
of skipping most public government and party functions 
but the 85yearold leader has made several public appearances 
in the past month despite reported ill health most recently he 
was shown on television thursday meeting briefly with more than 
2000 partyselected model workers 
at that gathering he walked sidebyside with jiang apparently 
underscoring his desire to promote jiang as the new party center 
small parties and receptions celebrating the 40th anniversary of 
communist rule have been going on all week jiangs speech began a 
weekend of activities at the great hall and adjoining tiananmen 
square 
in past years thousands of ordinary citizens flocked to the 
square in central beijing on national day to admire special 
displays of flowers and colored lights this year however the 
square has been under military guard open only to those with 
special permission ever since the army recaptured it june 34 from 
the student protesters after a bloody march into beijing that 
killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people 
elaborate flower arrangements in the shape of the national flag 
and other symbols have been erected in the vast square and 
specially chosen groups will perform dances there over the weekend 
celebrations will climax with a fireworks display sunday night 
also today shanghai students went to a cotton mill to begin a 
100day social investigation campaign aimed at awakening 
prodemocracy students to the realities of chinese life 
xinhua said students from more than 50 universities will send 
students to work along with and observe the common people 
the campaign organized by the city higher education bureau and 
the shanghai committee of the communist youth league will include 
a factory day a country day and a military camp day

congress is racing to get as much of its 
spending business finished as possible in time for the new fiscal 
year but once again lawmakers will fall dramatically short of 
their goal 
a handful of spending measures for various agencies advanced in 
congress thursday but with fiscal 1990 beginning sunday and only 
one of 13 annual spending bills on president bushs desk lawmakers 
sent him a stopgap bill to keep the government functioning through 
oct 25 
bush signed the emergency measure today en route to south 
carolina where he examined destruction caused last week by 
hurricane hugo the bill contained 11 billion for areas wrecked 
by the storms winds and waves 
congressional leaders had been saying until the last several 
days that they hoped to complete all 13 spending bills by oct 1 
lawmakers met that deadline last year the first time they had done 
so since 1976 
the senate early today adopted a 288 billion military spending 
measure for next year that would provide 43 billion for star wars 
programs the overall bill was adopted 962 on the days crucial 
tally lawmakers voted 5347 to restore 600 million to star wars 
they had cut earlier 
the house provided just 31 billion for the missile defense 
system that difference is one of many that housesenate 
negotiators will try thrashing out beginning next week 
the house meanwhile voted 274137 to adopt a 19 billion 
compromise bill financing congress own operations next year that 
reduces mass mailings from six to three annually but saves them 
from virtual elimination 
only tuesday the house voted 245137 for a nonbinding measure 
supporting an almost total end to the free mailings the 45 
million saved was to be spent for treatment and prevention programs 
for pregnant drug addicts 
housesenate negotiators also are continuing their search for a 
compromise to the amendment by sen jesse helms to ban federal aid 
for obscene or indecent materials or for a work that 
denigrates a persons race religion ethnic origin sex age 
or handicap 
helms rnc lost a round early today when the senate voted 
6235 against a show of support for his amendment the chamber had 
adopted the provision on a voice vote on july 26 
bargainers indicated thursday they were considering requiring 
that a commission study how federal grants are dispersed to art 
projects they were divided over whether a law was needed defining 
standards of decency a work should meet to qualify for government 
backing 
one federally funded exhibits recently included photographs 
depicting homosexual acts and children in suggestive positions 
while another showed a photograph of a crucifix in urine

the soviet union dropped an atomic bomb near red 
army units in 1954 to test the effects of the blast and soldiers 
ability to fight on irradiated ground a newspaper disclosed today 
after the atomic strike there were not only no landmarks left 
on the terrain but the area itself became unrecognizable said 
the armed forces daily red star however the troops fulfilled 
their assigned tasks completely 
the newspaper said the bomb was dropped from a plane in the 
south urals it did not report any casualties or address the 
longterm health problems caused by radiation and how the soldiers 
may have been affected 
in the united states 100 nuclear tests were conducted above 
ground at the nevada test site near las vegas prior to 1963 when 
president kennedy signed the treaty banning explosions in the 
atmosphere 
in april 22 1952 a bomb was dropped from a us airplane and 
detonated in the air as news reporters sat on bleachers watching 
the event was seen live on network television scores of soldiers 
who were assigned to the us test site during the aboveground 
explosions have sought compensation from congress for illnesses 
they trace to the testing 
red star said foxholes and fire trenches many with overhead 
covers and deep underground shelters with double doors were built 
for the soldiers equipment and ammunition involved in the soviet 
exercise 
the newspaper said the bomb was exploded because of the cold war 
and at a time when nato forces in europe were expanding by bringing 
west germany into the defense alliance 
it never occurred to us to question any measure meant to 
bolster the armys battleworthiness and the countrys defense 
capability red star said 
the newspapers expose was titled the explosion we can now 
talk about although testing of the atomic device was reported by 
the official tass news agency three days after it took place there 
was no mention then that troops were involved 
at the time the effects of radiation were the least understood 
aspect of atomic weapons the report said the bomb was exploded 
500 meters yards above ground leaving little radioactive 
contamination the newspaper said 
nikolai bulganin who was then soviet defense minister 
described the test as successful red star said 
since 1963 all us nuclear tests have been buried in holes 
drilled beneath the nevada desert or in tunnels carved into 
hillsides

states 
salinas said mexican agents have seized more than 24 tons of 
cocaine this year he said that represents a significant portion of 
us consumption

there were more coordination and a greater exchange of information 
with the united states 
in his talks with bush salinas said he also will press for 
expanded markets in the united states for mexican products such as 
textiles and steel 
mexico has opened its markets to us products in recent months 
and salinas said the continuation of this opening of our 
markets depends on reciprocity 
salinas said relations between mexico and the united states are 
marked by respect and cordiality 
he said mexico could not have renegotiated payments on a large 
chunk of its 1074 billion foreign debt without the support of the 
bush administraton

state college and university presidents say they 
will refuse to comply with a budgetcrisis order by the dukakis 
administration to cut 700 positions from the higher education 
system 
this is not something that i will do in the middle of a year 
where weve already cut 8 million joseph duffey chancellor of 
the university of massachusetts at amherst told the boston globe 
thursday 
theres no way we can do it and be a university when its 
over said william t hogan president of the university of 
lowell i wont do it 
the mandate issued wednesday orders umass to cut an additional 
8 million and about 200 positions and lowell to lay off 56 in a 
25 million reduction of its 526 million budget 
franklyn g jenifer chancellor of the board of regents of 
higher education said he is scheduled to discuss the order monday 
with the man who issued it administration and finance secretary l 
edward lashman 
ive talked to 12 presidents today and they all say they 
simply cant do it said umass president david knapp who heads 
an association of state college presidents there just isnt a 
lot of flexibility at this point 
the administration of gov michael s dukakis ordered the 
elimination of 2300 state jobs by jan 1 as part of a 5 percent 
acrosstheboard budget cut to offset an estimated 340 million 
budget shortfall 
the education cutbacks are intended to reduce administrative 
positions said charles baker a top administration and finance 
aide 
our preference would be that they minimize the impact on 
teaching faculty he said 
well just lock up their funds baker said of any college 
president who fails to comply we cant have administrators 
dictating whether were going to have a budget deficit 
were in the process of dismantling the educational 
system countered paul e tsongas chairman of the regents my 
question is whether this dismantling is with the consent of the 
state as a whole 
roseanne bacon president of the massachusetts teachers 
association which represents about 6000 employees in the higher 
education system said the response to the administrations order 
should be just say no

threatening weather 
delayed the launch of a private rocket to test star wars 
antimissile sensors and a possible escape vehicle for space 
station astronauts 
the 58foottall american rocket co booster was scheduled for 
launch from this coastal military base thursday at a time when the 
pentagons delta star satellite woul be orbiting overhead in proper 
position for the star wars experiment 
but the 2 million launch and 15minute suborbital flight were 
postponed until saturday because rain clouds and fog created the 
possibility the 33400pound rocket could be hit by lightning said 
george whittinghill amrocs marketing director 
amroc based in camarillo calif billed the planned launch as 
the first in the nation using a rocket totally designed and built 
with private funds there have been two other commercial launches 
in the united states this year but both used rockets built with 
government money 
the amroc booster is intended to release a cloud of inert gas 
for a test of missiledetecting sensors aboard the delta star 
satellite which was launched from florida in march 
delta star contains various sensors that some day may be used as 
part of a strategic defense initiative system nicknamed star wars 
in which satellites would detect incoming enemy nuclear warheads 
so they could be destroyed defense department spokesman maj 
william oconnell said by phone from the pentagon 
the amroc rocket also was scheduled to deploy an engineering 
test model of an 8footwide parashield it is a combined heat 
shield and parachute that someday might be part of an escape system 
to allow space station astronauts to return to earth said david 
akin assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
akins design class built the 390pound model which includes a 
parashield and instruments to monitor its performance after he 
assigned them to design a spacecraft that could be launched on any 
existing us space boosters

two women have been charged with lining up 
their six children in the home they shared and allowing men to take 
their pick for sex police said 
annette sanford 34 of south haven was charged last week with 
four counts of firstdegree criminal sexual conduct carolyn 
wilson 42 of bangor was charged with one count of firstdegree 
child abuse and four counts of criminal sexual conduct they are 
not accused of sexually abusing the children themselves 
investigators say they believe at least seven men visited the 
womens house frequently in 1987 and 1988 to choose their victims 
from the lineup they said the children were then sexually 
assaulted in their bedrooms 
the kids would just look at each other as if to say oh god 
not again detective patrick oreilly said 
the women have denied the allegations police said 
the women who are not related were living together in otsego 
township about 30 miles south of grand rapids and each had three 
children in the house sheriffs lt rick cain said today that the 
six children have a number of different last names and authorities 
have been unable to determine who their biological fathers are he 
said the women have been uncooperative in background checks on them 
or the children 
the children five girls and one boy have been living in foster 
homes since may 1988 after one of the girls came to school with 
bruises and told school officials of the alleged abuse five of the 
children are 8 to 13 years old the sixth is a developmentally 
disabled 18yearold girl 
after interviewing the girl at school cain said he petitioned 
the allegan county probate court to have the children removed 
police didnt seek arrest warrants for the women until two weeks 
ago when they believed the children were prepared to testify we 
didnt feel a year ago they were prepared to testify or could 
testify cain said 
police said the lineups occurred at least once a week for at 
least a year the women also allegedly beat the children and forced 
them to clean floors with toothbrushes and eat dog food police 
said 
authorities were investigating motives for the alleged crimes 
the assumption would be money or narcotics changed hands cain 
said 
there is medical evidence to substantiate the childrens claims 
of sexual abuse police said two of the girls were believed to 
have been spared they added 
one man robert sterling of muskegon has been charged with 
seconddegree criminal sexual conduct and police are seeking 
others 
theyd select their child and go into a room to have sex the 
kids stories are consistent and corroborate each other cain 
said 
the women were being held in the allegan county jail sanford on 
10000 bond and wilson on 12500 bond a hearing is scheduled 
tuesday in circuit court

the senate today embraced a toneddown version 
of sen jesse helms attempt to ban federal aid for obscene 
art 11 hours after it voted to reject more sweeping restrictions 
outright 
on a 6531 vote senators approved a nonbinding measure urging 
housesenate negotiators to adopt legislation ending government 
assistance for obscene depictions of some sexual and erotic 
subjects but falling short of all the restrictions helms wanted 
we do know in our hearts that there is such a thing as 
obscenity said sen wyche fowler dga who opposed parts of 
helms proposal and helped shape the new provision 
the adopted language evolved when helms rnc offered to drop 
his insistence that federal aid should be forbidden for art that 
denigrates a religion race ethnic background sex or handicap 
fowler despite helms opposition convinced his colleagues to 
also drop a prohibition against federal support for indecent 
art 
helms said dropping the word indecent would leave a 
loophole to people who want to continue to abuse the use of tax 
dollars 
but opponents indicated that use of indecent was vague with 
fowler saying his deletion of the word strengthens the measure 
helms angry that his amendment appeared about to be watered 
down forced the full senate early today to show its members 
individual preferences for the first time on his measure in a vote 
surprising for its decisiveness they voted 6235 against him 
the tally which was a nonbinding expression of support was a 
reversal of the senates decision two months ago to adopt the ban 
fortythree democrats and 19 republicans opposed helms while 10 
democrats and 25 republicans supported him 
before the vote helms remained insistent that the government 
should decide which works of art it will finance 
when they start saying to the congress of the united states 
butt out just send the money this senator says no helms 
said 
but opponents argued the proposal was too farreaching sen 
wyche fowler dga said differences between religions over jesus 
christs divinity could be considered offensive and fall under the 
laws restrictions 
depictions in this bible in any written work much less 700 
years of christian art can be conceived as being deeply offensive 
to jews said fowler 
helms provision was in a bill that would provide about 11 
billion for federal land and cultural programs for fiscal 1990 
which begins sunday 
the legislation contained other controversial provisions on 
which lawmakers reached compromises on thursday 
in one instance they agreed that studies and other activities 
that would precede oil and gas exploration off the california coast 
would be delayed for five months next year the moratorium was 
worked out between energy interests and drilling opponents seeking 
to protect the environment 
as has been routine since the early 1980s the legislation 
imposes another oneyear moratorium on leasing and drilling in 
federal waters off alaska much of california florida and much of 
the northeast drilling opponents say the fivemonth delay would 
help postpone drilling if the moratorium were ever lifted 
the negotiators also adopted new restrictions on lobbyists who 
seek grants and other federal monies for clients the provisions 
sponsored by sen robert byrd dwva forbid those lobbyists from 
being paid with the federal funds they obtain and requires most of 
them to file public reports with congress 
they reached no deal on the helms amendment thursday but moved 
closer to one 
liberals and conservatives agreed a commission should be 
established to study how federal arts aid is distributed and 
whether standards should be set for works to qualify for government 
funds 
but they disagreed over whether they should enact guidelines 
describing which art is suitable for government assistance before 
the commission completes its work 
the national endowment for the arts provided 45000 for two 
exhibitions that have created an uproar among conservatives one 
included an andres serrano photograph of a crucifix in a bottle of 
urine while the other included photos by the late robert 
mapplethorpe depicting homosexual activities and children in erotic 
poses 
the senate passed helms amendment on a voice vote july 26 with 
only a handful of lawmakers in the chamber the house legislation 
contained no such language 
the amendment would prohibit the use of federal money to exhibit 
obscene or indecent materials including depictions of 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the exploitation of children or 
individuals engaged in sex acts 
it also bars federal aid for material that denigrates people 
based on their religion race sex handicap age or ethnic origin

braniff incs second attempt to come back from 
bankruptcy faces formidible obstacles from major airlines that can 
afford frequentflier programs huge computer networks and 
elaborate marketing schemes analysts say 
the megacarriers definitely control the game now if you 
dont have a true niche like southwest or midway theres no way 
to battle the major airlines on the longhaul routes said robert 
decker of duff amp phelps in chicago 
braniff which reported losses of more than 1 million a week 
since february filed for protection from creditors under chapter 
11 of the us bankruptcy code at about 2 am thursday in orlando 
fla where the carrier relocated its headquarters from dallas in 
may 
braniff first filed for chapter 11 protection in 1982 and 
emerged two years later with hopes of a rebound 
the carrier also has announced plans to cut its work force to 
about 2000 from 4791 including 556 pilots and 1167 airport 
personnel more than half of braniffs workers are based in dallas 
orlando and kansas city mo its flight hub 
braniff just ran out of cash said edward starkman an 
analyst at painewebber inc which led an investor group that 
purchased the carrier last year they had some good ideas and 
viable plans they just were losing money too quickly 
thousands of travelers were left stranded and workers were 
stunned when braniff canceled all flights wednesday afternoon 
the airline said it is reducing the number of cities it serves 
from 36 to 11 san diego los angeles san francisco phoenix 
dallas chicago kansas city orlando new york la guardia 
newark nj and washington dc national 
braniff also announced it will offer 49 oneway tickets between 
any of the 11 cities starting monday the fare will be available 
through wednesday 
the carrier extended the expiration date of issued tickets until 
sept 27 1990 continental airlines and eastern airlines both 
subsidiaries of texas air corp said they will honor most braniff 
tickets 
at orlando international airport margie tomlin found out about 
he canceled flights as she tried to get home to indiana i think 
its outrageous she said 
lou antabades of grand prairie texas said at the dallasfort 
worth airport that he had a premonition of braniffs troubles when 
he bought a ticket for a flight to the rocky mountains 
he remembered the first bankruptcy filing but i said no 
that wont happen again 
capt dick goduti vice president of the braniff pilots union 
said the bankruptcy filing was a blow to the airlines 900 pilots 
weve been down this rocky road before he said 
chuck skinner a braniff agent who went through the airlines 
first chapter 11 proceeding in 1982 predicted braniff would 
return probably as a much smaller carrier 
i am sure we will end up flying out of this one skinner 
said 
braniff lost 318 million on revenue of 293 million in the 
first six months of the year 
the financial problems largely were caused by braniffs 
relocation to orlando and its 2 billion order for 50 airbus a320 
aircraft industry analysts have said the company recently was 
unable to complete a 75 million financing deal 
william mcgee braniffs president and chief executive officer 
said braniff will not cancel its airbus order and will retain its 
options for 50 more in may mcgee announced plans to expand the 
work force by 35 percent and build maintenance facilities in 
orlando and kansas city 
they were losing money the writing was on the wall but 
sometimes you choose not to read the writing said nicholas 
glaskowsky a professor and airline industry expert at the 
university of miami ive seen it happen at other companies in 
trouble people dont want to believe the worst you know what they 
say hope springs eternal 
howard d putnam braniffs former chief executive who piloted 
the carrier through bankruptcy proceedings the last time agreed 
you could see it coming putnam said in an interview they 
took on a lot of debt they began a gigantic expansion in kansas 
city and they began to lose money they had been known as a 
lowfare airline and became a highfare airline they got out of 
their niche 
braniff tried to build up its kansas city hub to capitalize on 
the void left by strikebound eastern which was losing millions of 
dollars a day before filing for chapter 11 protection on march 9 
braniff had operated 93 daily departures from kansas city

south carolinans showed president bush 
roofless buildings decimated forests and other legacies of hugo 
today while the president defended his administrations handling 
of aid to the storms victims 
i do know that theres been a critic or two thats less than 
i would have expected but to the critics i simply say i 
understand we are trying very hard bush said at the charleston 
air force base at the end of his twohour visit 
before touching down at charleston bush signed a 11 billion 
relief package approved by congress on thursday he was greeted on 
his arrival by gov carroll campbell and charleston mayor joseph p 
riley jr the latter of whom had criticized a planned aerial tour 
by the president as being too removed from the people 
however bad weather forced bush to travel by motorcade through 
charleston and to summerville an inland town 22 miles northwest 
which suffered major utility and timber damage 
summerville mayor berlin meyers showed bush the grounds of the 
dorchester county courthouse littered with fallen trees smashed 
vehicles and twisted metal 
the president patting the mayor on the shoulder said why am 
i here im here to give a little encouragement to a courageous 
man 
the weather cleared enough by midmorning for a 15minute 
helicopter tour of the coast 
bush told reporters of some chats he had with summerville 
residents 
one thing that touched me very much was a young homeowner 
there saying that he had had offers of help from all over this 
country bush said i think it does bring out the very best in 
the men and women of america who want to help in a tragedy of this 
nature 
the president then departed for an engagement in annapolis md 
before bushs arrival riley a democrat had complained 
airplane rides and helicopter rides are nice but everything is on 
the ground the buildings are on the ground the people are on the 
ground the stress is on the ground and we need a president who is 
on the ground 
riley said it was absolutely ridiculous that only two 
federal disaster claims offices have opened in the charleston area 
the federal emergency management agency has opened five claims 
offices across the state to serve 17 counties that have been 
declared disaster areas white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said today the president would increase the number of fema offices 
in south carolina to nine 
there were long lines at those offices thursday as thousands of 
people applied for grants and lowinterest loans to help cover 
storm losses not covered by insurance 
an angry sen ernest hollings dsc also criticized fema 
weve got to make sure everything possible has been done at 
the washington level fema is still the bottleneck he said 
but us rep arthur ravenel a republican whose district 
includes charleston blamed partisan politics for some of the 
criticism 
its very easy to find fault and point fingers ravenel 
said adding he believed fema was moving as fast as it could to 
speed storm relief to the state 
meanwhile an insurance group estimated thursday that hugo 
caused 25 billion in insured losses in the state 
the preliminary figure released by the property claim services 
division of the american insurance services group does not include 
uninsured losses stateinsured property marine and harbor 
facilities aircraft utility equipment or public property such as 
roads and bridges 
in washington robert sheets director of the national hurricane 
center told a senate subcommittee on environmental protection 
today that the damage from hugo probably will total 2 billion and 
i wouldnt be surprised if it was much more 
charleston residents were somewhat lucky in the path the sept 
21 storm took sheets said since hugos maximum strength struck 
just north of the city in the francis marion national forest where 
few people live 
meanwhile aid continued to flood in from around the nation 
shipments included 5000 cases of baby food four tons of pet food 
and a ton of mississippi catfish 
the american red cross said it had donated 42 million to aid 
hurricane victims in the caribbean and on the mainland making it 
the largest relief effort in the organizations history 
charleston officials have opened a hotline to obtain the 
services of contractors and artisans to help rebuild historic 
buildings and artisans from massachusetts and illinois have 
arrived about 75 percent of the 3500 city structures deemed of 
historical value were damaged in the storm city historians said 
the death toll from hugo was 29 in the united states including 
18 in south carolina the storm is blamed for 33 deaths in the 
caribbean 
animals also fell prey to the fury of hugos 135 mph winds the 
news and courier of charleston reported today 
the cape romain national wildlife refuge home to a number of 
endangered and threatened species lost an undetermined number of 
animals its visitors center and dock according to refuge manager 
george r garris 
the storm also swept away 50 years of refuge records including 
nest counts of loggerhead sea turtles a threatened species 
on bulls island part of the refuge at least two red wolves 
survived garris said transmitters in the collars of the 
endangered wolves show the male and one of his five daughters are 
moving around the island the other four female pups dont appear 
to have changed position since before the storm 
at least 203000 power customers remain without power more than 
half of those in the charleston area riley said power had been 
restored to about 20 percent of the city 
the charleston international airport reopened thursday although 
the concourses werent open because of storm damage 20 incoming 
and outgoing commercial flights used the facility

timing and a little luck helped quash a 
smoky fire that caused evacuation of the 101yearold texas capitol 
but no injuries and relatively minor damage 
the fire started thursday in a basement airhandling unit and 
pumped enough smoke up air vents to fill the twostorytall house 
chamber with a foulsmelling haze 
but firefighters who arrived 90 seconds after the first call 
cleared the building and extinguished the threealarm fire within 
an hour 
we were lucky that the fire was detected early it was during 
daytime hours and people were in the capitol to report it said 
lt scott reynolds of the austin fire department 
that contrasted with an early morning blaze in february 1983 
that gutted parts of the senate wing of the historic building and 
nearly claimed the entire structure 
fire capt jack floyd said cork insulation in the airhandling 
unit caught fire about 430 pm the cause of the fire is still 
under investigation 
battalion chief john teasdale said he had reports that a work 
was being done in the basement and there may have been a spark 
from a welding torch however jesse williams of the state 
purchasing and general services administration which maintains the 
building said the workers were in another part of the basement 
reynolds said today that firefighters had no estimate of the 
number of people evacuated or a damage estimate for the building 
the capitol was closed this morning as officials awaited results 
of air monitoring tests to determine if any areas were contaminated 
by asbestos firefighters had to cut through asbestos to extinguish 
the fire

president corazon aquino said friday 
she has forgiven ferdinand marcos for the murder of her husband but 
cannot permit the late president to be buried here because it would 
trigger domestic unrest 
the government put troops and police on alert after the 
72yearold former president died thursday in honolulu there were 
no major demonstrations by marcos supporters 
leaders of marcos new society movement met to map strategy for 
forcing mrs aquino to allow their former leader to be buried in 
his homeland 
marcos supporters will ask the supreme court to overturn the 
ban said nicanor yniguez former speaker of the national assembly 
and a prominent promarcos leader 
can a dead man destabilize a government that always claims to 
be stable yniguez asked 
mrs aquino said officials would periodically review the ban and 
could lift it in the future 
we believe that allowing the remains of the late president to 
be brought back here would cause some instability and would 
discourage very much investors and tourists from coming here plus 
also dividing the people mrs aquino said in a nationally 
televised news conference 
for my part i have forgiven mr marcos she added but it 
is not just a question of forgiving as president of the 
philippines it is my duty to see to it that the security and 
welfare of the filipino people is assured 
mrs aquino has blamed marcos for the august 1983 assassination 
of her husband sen benigno aquino jr who was shot to death as 
he arrived at manilas airport to end three years of selfimposed 
exile in the united states and challenge marcos rule 
forty people mostly soldiers are on trial for the slaying 
following the announcement of marcos death military chief of 
staff gen renato de villa said the nation was calm and we have 
not seen anything that is abnormal in the country 
marcos loyalists have been blamed for some of the six armed 
attempts to topple mrs aquino since she took power feb 25 1986 
after a popular uprising ended marcos 20year rule 
mrs aquino who came to power three years ago in the uprising 
that toppled marcos ordered philippine flags flown at halfstaff 
until sunday on government buildings 
she said the government would send a representative to marcos 
funeral if he is buried in hawaii in honolulu marcos widow 
imelda said she would continue efforts to return her husband to 
the philippines 
mrs marcos called mrs aquinos decision so cruel so inhuman 
and so immoral she said there were no immediate plans for burial 
marcos brother pacifico joined family friends and relatives 
for a roman catholic mass at a suburban manila church later about 
300 marcos supporters held a vigil in front of the armed forces 
headquarters compound 
in marcos home province of ilocos norte about 200 people 
attended a vigil at the marcos family home in batac 230 miles 
north of manila 
loyalists planned masses on saturday but had no plans for large 
demonstrations 
mrs aquino had refused to let marcos attend the funeral of his 
mother josefa edralinmarcos who died may 4 1988 or the burial 
of his sister elizabeth keon who died in december 1986 
mrs edralinmarcos body which has been embalmed several 
times remains in batac

turkey on friday banned the import sale 
and distribution of salman rushdies the satanic verses a book 
denounced by moslems as blasphemous 
the government of this predominantly moslem country gave no 
reason why the ban came months after controversy erupted elsewhere 
over the book 
turkish publishers have not translated or published the book 
fearing possible violent reaction from moslem fundamentalists 
in march the head of turkeys religious affairs department said 
he opposed publication of the book because it contained ugly and 
insolent slander against the prophet mohammed and his wives 
turkish officials deplored the call by the late iranian leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini for the murder of rushdie who still 
lives in hiding

the 1989 nobel peace prize will be announced 
next thursday and right now norways nobel institute could use a 
little peace 
we dont get anything done because the phone is always 
ringing said kristin kjellberg office manager for the institute 
the winner of the 70th peace prize has been decided but as 
usual the name is kept secret until the formal announcement 
despite a stream of telephone calls from the curious said jakop 
svedrup institute director 
it doesnt do any goodwe never tell he said in an 
interview 
the selection committee is not swayed by lobbyists or by 
thousands of letters promoting favorites among candidates this 
year numbering 90 svedrup said 
committee chairman egil aarvik agreed we look at some 
letters but rise above that kind of influence and look at other 
criteria he told the associated press 
the prize first awarded in 1901 is worth 385000 this year 
most people who lobby the committee seek the prestige of the 
prize for their candidate or organization 
but one man just wanted the cash 
once a man who clearly had problems asked what he could do 
to get the prize he said he hadnt done anything for world peace 
but could really use the money said svedrup 
he offered to split the prize money if i could get him the 
prize svedrup said the man was never considered 
candidates may be nominated by previous laureates members of 
parliaments or political science faculty members of selected 
universities 
when delegations come to campaign for legitimate candidates we 
listen to what they have to say and bid them farewell it doesnt 
have any effect svedrup said 
letters also clog the institutes austere oslo office but we 
dont take them into account he said 
we do spend a lot of time sorting mail said ms kjellberg 
many people some with tragic stories write asking for the 
money they dont understand the prize 
the nobel laureate is chosen by a fivemember committee elected 
by the norwegian parliament to sixyear terms the institute which 
has five permanent employees maintains a library and provides the 
committee with meeting rooms and research facilities 
the committee meets six or seven times a year no notes leave 
the room no list of candidates is made available and the 
committees deliberations are by law kept secret for 50 years 
svedrup said secrecy protects candidates sometimes keeping 
details of their activities from their home governments 
each year norways media try to guess the winner this year bets 
are on czech human rights activists jiri hajak or vaclav havel 
imprisoned south african activist nelson mandela soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev or ronald reagan 
this years choice will be criticized they always are 
svedrup said the prize will be presented in oslo on dec 10 the 
anniversary of the 1896 death of benefactor alfred nobel the 
inventor of dynamite 
last year the prize went to the un peacekeeping forces other 
recent winners were polish solidarity leader lech walesa south 
african bishop desmond tutu and indias mother teresa 
there have been 19 years in which no prize was awarded 
nobel a swede never explained why he picked norways 
parliament to award the peace prize the nobel prizes for 
literature chemistry and physics are awarded in sweden and will 
be announced in stockholm later in october 
some believe nobel wished to ease tensions between the 
neighboring countries which were under one crown when he wrote his 
will in 1895 the union dissolved in 1905 
nobel hoped his 1867 invention of dynamite would prove to be a 
powerful weapon that would deter war and bring peace 
my dynamite factories may well put an end to war sooner than 
your peace conferences he wrote to a friend and peace activist 
in 1892 the day when two army corps can annihilate one another 
in one second all civilized nations it is to be hoped will 
recoil from war and discharge their troops

a man who is in hot water after being 
caught with an oversize lobster says herb was a pet and marine 
patrol officers went too far when they seized the 10pound 
crustacean and made two boys cry 
james benenson a new yorker and summer resident of this down 
east town said friday he would not mind paying the 7150 fine for 
lobster fishing without a license but he pleaded innocent at 
arraignment thursday 
the reason im scrapping about it is that i think it is quite 
silly bothering children over a benign act benenson said 
he said two officers confiscated herb earlier this month from 
the submersible box where his sons james 10 and clement 8 had 
kept it for about seven years 
they cried their eyes out said benenson he recalled his 
younger son telling him daddy police are supposed to help you 
not make you cry 
benenson said he does not know where herb was taken but we 
hope hes not in someones stomach 
messages left friday at the marine patrol headquarters in 
augusta were not returned immediately a secretary said no officers 
were available at the ellsworth field office and referred calls to 
augusta 
herb lived on seafood fed by his family 
he loved pogies a fish used for bait and oil said 
benenson he loved dogfish he could eat a 3foot dogfish in less 
than a week and he would eat everything but the teeth 
herb also loved to be scratched while lying on the dock 
preferably with mussel shells and that is what ultimately led to 
benensons citation 
officers spotted the lobster earlier this month later two 
officers came to benensons home and demanded identification so 
they could cite him benenson said 
benenson said he tried to find a new home for herb at aquariums 
but failed and the officers later confiscated the lobster 
technically benenson is accused of lobster fishing with the 
wooden box his sons used to catch crabs said benenson 
his lawyer barry mills said he hopes to work out an agreement 
with prosecutors in as amicable a way as possible 
on a scale of crime from one to 1000 this is a one half 
said mills

ptl founder jim bakker testified today 
that the fundraising technique at the heart of his fraud and 
conspiracy trial occurred to him in the middle of the night as a 
vision or a dream 
i think fundraising was my most burdensome job bakker 
testified it never left me you never ever ever get away from 
the pressure that you have to raise funds for next week next 
month next year 
when he left ptl the budget was 160 million a year which i 
think boils down to 3 million a week bakker said 
under questioning by defense attorney george t davis bakker 
described the roots of his ptl ministry in a low voice at one 
point when he looked at davis the lawyer pointed for him to look 
directly at the jury 
neither his wife tammy faye nor his two children were in the 
courtroom when bakker testified 
after describing his early years as an evangelist bakker talked 
about his vision to build the 2400acre heritage usa chrsitian 
retreat 
the vision from god was to build a modern christian campground 
where people could worship attend seminars and workshops bakker 
said 
as the ministry grew he said we needed to build in the 
middle of the night i woke up it was a vision or a dream i dont 
know god gave me the concept of the heritage grand partner center 
and i began to sketch it 
he later described the same event i woke up in the morning 
and began to write down the concept of lifetime partnerships i 
brought the concept to my staff and showed it to some vice 
presidents and accountants i asked them if it would work and they 
said yes 
bakker is accused of bilking followers of 158 million through 
the sale of the 1000 partnerships which typically entitled 
holders to three nights lodging a year in ptl hotels near fort 
mill sc 
defense attorneys have claimed the partnerships were not sales 
transactions and that the money paid for them constituted gifts to 
the ministry 
in their presentation prosecutors presented several ptl 
partners who said they sometimes were turned away when they tried 
to use their lodging benefits prosecutors contend bakker oversold 
partnerships and diverted 37 million of the money to himself 
bakker resigned from his ministry in a sex and money scandal in 
1987 and is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
bakker faces 120 years in prison and fines of more than 5 
million if found guilty on all the charges 
defense attorneys on thursday continued their parade of 
witnesses testifying to bakkers character by the end of the days 
court session at least 72 defense witnesses testified more than 
50 of whom said they continue to have faith in bakker and described 
him as a man of god 
us district court judge robert potter clashed with defense 
attorneys wednesday over the number of bakkers witnesses potter 
said he usually allows only five character witnesses during a 
trial but defense attorney harold bender said the witnesses were 
satisfied backers important to his case 
jurors heard thursday from satisfied partners 
sharon creech a school teacher from rock hill sc described 
her stay at heritage grand hotel as the next best thing to being 
close to jesus 
lola pinney testified she recently changed her will to leave her 
entire estate to the bakkers 
since the defense began its case sept 20 defense attorneys 
also have shown the jury videotapes of seven ptl programs

philip poole londons favorite purveyor of pens 
nibs and peacock feathers is closing shop and with him goes 
another little piece of england 
poole is giving up his drury lane shop in the heart of londons 
theater district forced out by a rent hike from 9900 to 32000 
a year 
it may be inevitable in this age of supermarkets word 
processors and ballpoint pens but to lovers of tradition and good 
service it is a tragedy the closing of philip pooles is being 
recorded wistfully in newspapers and television and customers are 
flocking in to buy up supplies for the lean years ahead 
poole 79 is so wellknown in his field that he is nicknamed 
his nibs for 56 years he has sold and repaired pens for 
cartoonists artists and practitioners of penmanship but the store 
that bears pooles name sits on some of the choicest real estate in 
london and a sudden tripling of the rent is not unusual 
everyones desperately sorry said maureen greenland the 
secretary of the 300member writing equipment society which poole 
founded in 1979 and still chairs 
hes one of the old school with an oldfashioned shop with 
reasonable prices and a unique kind of service he has perfect 
background knowledge of the history of writing equipment ms 
greenland said 
with eight weeks to move poole is selling the remains of an 
inventory of 5000 fountain pens and 500000 pen tips he says his 
future plans are uncertain but he doesnt want to retire 
pooles wisps of white hair are held in place by half glasses 
he wears a white coat and a small white quill pen is embroidered 
on his navy blue tie 
he modestly admits theres no shop quite like philip pooles 
where each sale is entered into a spiral notebook and mahogany 
drawers holding thousands of tiny pen nibs occupy all available 
surfaces 
its a specialized business said poole as he counted a 
customers change from a gray strongbox that serves as the cash 
register theres too little turnover for a modern store that 
likes quick selling theyd never be able to stock all of these 
one or two nibs would drive them mad 
music copyist harold sim came in and bought 20 nibs i hope 
this will tide me over for a few years he said what will he do 
when they run out i dont know 
five peacock feathers remain unsold 
some people use peacock feathers for drawing but i cant see 
why said poole one woman told me she liked them because you 
cant control their movement must be for abstract pictures 
ironically the store is closing at a time when fountain pens 
are enjoying a renaissance they appeal to the nostalgia market as 
well as to business people looking for symbols of solidity in a 
throwaway culture 
its a reaction against computers said poole citing a 
managing director of a computer firm who came in recently to buy a 
pen he told me that if he really wants to get his workers 
attention he issues a handwritten memo 
ms greenland said many of her societys members are tourists 
who chanced upon pooles shop and were so enchanted they paid the 
16 to join 
its a tragedy really she said he obviously doesnt have 
all the time in the world and he should really go on and on its 
dreadful that he has to leave without any choice

support for ferdinand marcos has 
dwindled steadily since he was ousted in a civilianmilitary 
uprising three years ago and few believe his followers are strong 
enough to topple his successor corazon aquino 
still president aquino refuses to allow marcos who died 
thursday in hawaii to be buried here because she said the funeral 
might trigger destabilization efforts 
her adamant stand reflects a fear among senior officials that 
marcos wellfinanced followers can create enough trouble to 
discredit the government and frighten off foreign investors needed 
to help rebuild the countrys debtridden economy 
in a country where public opinion surveys are notoriously 
unreliable it is difficult to determine the extent of support for 
marcos who ruled this country for 20 years longer than any 
philippine president 
but the results of elections held since 1986 as well as the 
turnout in recent promarcos rallies indicate a decline in the 
number of hardcore marcos supporters 
after the february 1986 uprising that toppled marcos the late 
presidents followers could muster up to 10000 people for rallies 
demanding the return of the man they considered their legitimate 
president 
but in recent months marcos loyalists have been able to attract 
only a few hundred participants many are middleaged men and women 
from marcos northern luzon island stronghold 
none of the candidates clearly identified as marcos supporters 
won election to the senate in the may 1987 congressional balloting 
nineteen avowed promarcos politicians were elected to the 
200member house of representatives 
unlike the 24 senators who were elected in nationwide balloting 
house members were elected by district indicating scattered 
pockets of support for marcos particularly in northern luzon and 
parts of mindanao island 
marcos supporters are organized into about 30 different 
factions including the akoy pilipino or i am a filipino 
group and the new society movement the party marcos organized 
one source with close ties to the marcos movement speaking on 
condition of anonymity estimated that up to a million of the 58 
million filipinos were either members of promarcos groups or 
supported them 
that represents a sizeable political base and already 
politicians are jockeying for control of the movement candidates 
for the marcos mantel include vice president salvador laurel sen 
juan ponce enrile and eduardo cojuangco mrs aquinos estranged 
cousin who fled to california after marcos was overthrown 
division within the marcos camp may be in part responsible for 
the delay in organizing the protests that were widely anticipated 
after marcos death 
after marcos ouster the peak of the loyalist movement was the 
june 1986 takeover of the manila hotel troops loyal to marcos 
seized the hotel and declared the former presidents 1986 running 
mate arturo tolentino as acting president 
the mutineers who were receiving instructions by telephone from 
marcos surrendered about 40 hours later in january 1987 
promarcos troops seized a radiotelevision station and held out 
for about 60 hours before surrendering 
afterward the government claimed marcos was preparing to leave 
hawaii secretly for manila in case the coup attempt succeeded 
the base of marcos support is in the ilocanospeaking areas of 
the north which includes the late presidents birthplace sarrat 
and the familys ancestral home batac 
other marcos strongholds include scattered areas of the central 
visayas islands and mindanao mostly in districts controlled by 
warlords with whom the former president forged alliances 
but the deepest sympathy for marcos is in the ilocano regions of 
the north filipino culture requires special loyalty to members of 
ones own linguistic group or province 
ilocanos a strongly clannish group number about 6 million and 
are the thirdlargest linguistic group in a country where more than 
80 languages and dialects are spoken 
ilocanos are strongly represented within the philippine 
military figures on their numbers are unavailable but reporters 
covering the august 1987 coup attempt led by renegade lt col 
gregorio honasan heard many of the mutineers speaking ilocano

the army suspended the firing of 
mortars at fort stewart while it determines what caused the 
explosion that killed two soldiers handling one of the weapons 
officials from the army safety center at fort rucker ala were 
investigating thursdays accident in georgia and another accident 
the day before at fort sill okla where an errant artillery shell 
killed three soldiers and wounded 24 
there was no relationship between the accidents which involved 
different types of weapons said lt colonel herbert blanks public 
affairs officer for the safety center 
the 42inch mortar that exploded could have been faulty or one 
of the victims might have made an error setting the timing fuse on 
the device said maj donald w keeling a fort stewart spokesman 
at this point we really dont know what happened but they 
were the ones handling the munitions keeling said 
a mortar is a shortbarreled cannon that can be fired from a

demand was not quickly met

a federal appeals court today lifted a 
trial stay in the case of a former cia station chief accused of 
lying to investigators looking into the irancontra dealings of 
oliver north 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that attorney general dick thornburgh and the justice 
department did not have standing to intervene in the case over the 
objections of independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
the panel dismissed the departments appeal which walsh had 
challenged as amounting to an effort to wrest control of the 
irancontra case from his office 
we are of course gratified by their decision and we will 
proceed with the case walsh said in a statement 
walsh and the attorney general have been locked in a feud over 
how to proceed against joseph f fernandez a former cia station 
chief in costa rica the dispute on which the appeals court heard 
testimony aug 23 involves protecting classified documents 
the justice department is studying whether to appeal further 
said spokesman david runkel 
were reviewing the various options which the department has 
at this time runkel said the options include seeking a 
rehearing of the case by the same threejudge panel the full 4th 
circuit or going to the supreme court runkel said 
in addition there is the option of discussing this with the 
independent counsel to see if we could resolve the issue there 
runkel said 
earlier this year the justice department asked the supreme 
court to review the same issue after a federal appellate court in 
washington found that the justice department could not intervene on 
secrecy issues in the trial of north a former national security 
council aide 
but the case before the high court was dropped when the justice 
department and walsh resolved their differences allowing norths 
trial to proceed he was convicted of three charges arising from 
his efforts to cover up the irancontra affair 
fernandez was charged in april with two counts of obstruction 
and two counts of making false statements to the cia inspector 
generals office and the tower commission that threemember board 
was appointed by thenpresident reagan to investigate the diversion 
to the nicaraguan rebels of proceeds from the sales of us arms to 
iran 
in july us district judge claude m hilton in alexandria 
ruled that fernandez could disclose as part of his defense the 
location of several cia facilities in latin america and details of 
secret cia programs 
the classified information procedures act passed by congress in 
1980 to address situations in which a criminal defendant threatens 
to reveal government secrets during trial gives the government the 
authority to challenge such revelations the 4th circuit panel said 
but walshs office wanted to use an affidavit with the trial 
court to block disclosure of the classified information the 
justice department pressed for a pretrial appeal of hiltons 
rulings 
according to the 4th circuit the government in this case is the 
independent counsel not the justice department 
an independent prosecutor is not independent if the department 
can exercise supervision or intefere with his decisions the panel 
said 
the pretrial appeal right is important in limiting judicial 
errors that might affect a prosecutions outcome the panel said 
independent counsel must be able to decide when and whether to 
use this device the panel said 
the court said it had to reconcile the ethics in government act 
which allows the use of such counsel to prosecute highranking 
executive branch officials and the classified information statute 
neither of which refer to each other 
the panel also said its decision should be narrowly interpreted 
and that the attorney general has other powers closely related to 
protecting government secrets including the right to file an 
affidavit prohibiting such disclosures

the government said friday that its chief 
forecasting gauge turned up in august for the second straight 
month another sign the nations economy is likely to grow albeit 
modestly at least into next year 
the commerce departments index of leading indicators climbed 
03 percent last month after rising 01 percent in july and falling 
01 percent in june 
the backtoback julyaugust advance was consistent with 
expectations of many analysts who foresee the current economic 
expansion reaching its seventh birthday in december and continuing 
into 1990 
some had thought the expansion might be curtailed this year by 
federal reserve efforts to control inflation by tightening credit 
and thus slowing the economy but as inflation responded the fed 
has eased its grip permitting the economic growth to continue but 
at a slower pace 
the leading indicators are a mix of 11 forwardlooking business 
statistics designed to predict economic activity six to nine months 
into the future 
the index has risen four times this year and declined four 
prompting ysabel burns mcaleer of the american financial services 
association to observe this trendless result for 1989 seems 
consistent with the slow growth experience of the overall economy 
james annable chief domestic economist for the first national 
bank of chicago said fridays report shows continued growth but 
not robust and not terribly weak 
its sort of a middleoftheroad expansion and thats 
consistent with the other data were getting he said the 
notion that the economy is sliding into a recession has been 
rejected by the data what were getting is relatively modest 
growth 
lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser at the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa also forecasts continued economic expansion but 
adds it wont be very buoyant growth 
i think if were going to have a recession it probably wont 
start before the expansions birthday in december and i still 
think we will squeeze through 1990 without one chimerine said 
five of the indicators contributed to the august gain an 
increase in manufacturers new orders for consumer goods and 
materials higher stock prices an increase in the money supply 
lower initial unemployment claims and increased building permits 
six others pointed down a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence lower prices for sensitive materials indicating slower 
demand a decrease in manufactuers unfilled orders fewer orders 
for new plants and equipment faster vendor deliveries meaning 
declining demand and a shorter work week 
annable noted the drop in consumer expectations but said the 
decline was from a relatively high level and is expected to rebound 
what were getting right now is a little miniconsumer boom 
he said pointing to recent increase in auto sales and a 
turnaround in home sales and related purchases of homefurnishing 
goods 
lawrence a hunter deputy chief economist for the us chamber 
of commerce said the august indicators show that the economic 
slowdown should come to an end in the fourth quarter and the 
real gross national product should rise throughout 1990 
the gnp grew 31 percent on an annual basis during the first 
half of 1989 but is expected to slow during the second half the 
bush administration forecasts a 29 percent growth rate for the 
year meaning the economy would need to expand only at a 23 
percent annual rate to meet that goal

fourteen years after a 75yearold bag 
lady was bludgeoned to death with a stick of firewood in her 
oneroom shack police using computerized fingerprints have 
arrested a paroled felon 
jerry lindley 32 of college park pleaded innocent thursday to 
charges of murder and armed robbery in the 1975 death of billie 
fultz 
retired detective jerry fronebarger who investigated the case 
in 1975 described mrs fultz as an eccentric bag lady who 
lived alone without electricity or indoor plumbing 
authorities meanwhile have called lindleys arrest one of the 
most dramatic successes of the new fingerprint system since it was 
installed at the beginning of this year 
its the first one of this magnitude of this age where the 
fingerprint is 14 years old said thomas j mcgreevy deputy 
director of the georgia bureau of investigation 
last week when the police technician who originally worked the 
slaying took fingerprints found at the 1975 crime scene to the 
gbis new computer 
and on friday the machine matched fingerprints taken when 
lindley entered prison with prints lifted from mrs fultzs cashbox 
and a kerosene lantern after the slaying 
fronebarger said that in 1975 police manually searched without 
success through more than 200 fingerprints for a match to those 
found at the scene 
yet police said the 6 million automated fingerprint 
identification system whizzed out a fingerprint match in just 20 
minutes after starting a check through the 375 million prints on 
file 
fulton county police sgt donald cook said that on wednesday 
police arrested lindley who had been on parole after pleading 
guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the 1985 death of his wife

the goodwill resulting from a thaw in 
relations between alaska and the soviet union is spreading from 
people to dogs 
susan butcher a threetime winner of the 1100mile iditarod 
trail sled dog race was to leave friday for the soviet far east 
along with a veterinarian and two iditarod trail committee 
officials 
the group has three goals 
find two soviet mushers who would live in manley with butcher 
and her husband dave monson another winning musher and learn the 
ropes about sled dog racing alaskastyle 
examine sled dogs used in the soviet union for size and 
stamina comparisons with their alaska counterparts 
organize a committee on the soviet side of the bering strait 
that would help lay out a route for a new international sled dog 
race which would start in nome and end in the ussr after 
contestants had been flown across the strait 
ginna brelsford with the alaska office of international trade 
and a member of the bering bridge expedition which traveled 1000 
miles last spring by sled dog and kayak from the soviet far east to 
alaska helped arrange this weeklong trip 
all that sounds easy but its amazing how much time it takes 
to get things done over there brelsford said of the goals for 
butchers trip 
the soviets are no strangers to using dogs in the arctic but 
they lag far behind the us in developing racing equipment and 
techniques she said 
when we introduced our sleds they were excited about how 
light and how flexible they were and how easily they could be taken 
apart brelsford said of her trek last spring 
they still operate with heavy leather harnesses and use ivory 
hooks to connect things their technology is old when it comes to 
using dogs and sleds 
generally they use freight animals dogs bigger than what 
you see running the iditarod but not necessarily better 
brelsford said 
monson and butcher have 120 dogs in their manley kennel but 
monson said they always are looking for new bloodlines 
anything that will improve the general makeup of a sled dog so 
it would perform better would be of interest monson said 
the new race would be operated separately from the iditarod 
said rosemary phillips executive director of the race established 
in 1973 
we will not be taking anything from the iditarod sled dog race 
to put this on excepting experience phillips said weve had 
very positive responses from mushers lots and lots of calls 
wondering how they could enter 
the race would be run about the end of march at least two weeks 
after the winner of the iditarod crosses the finish line in nome 
she said 
mushers are a sturdy bunch you might see much the same teams 
in there from the iditarod 
the route would be from nome to wales in alaska from there 
mushers and dogs would be flown across the bering strait for a 
restart in uelen in the ussr and the eventual finish at anadyr 
she said 
we would love to do it in 1990 phillips said 
realistically speaking it probably will be 1991 
the group also will be recruiting soviet mushers and teams for 
the iditarod 
things like this just serve to break down the barriers 
phillips said its making the world smaller

an advertisement aimed at jewish voters placed 
by mayoral candidate rudolph giuliani showing opponent david 
dinkins with the rev jesse jackson was called racist by some 
jewish leaders 
the charges come on top of remarks made earlier in the week by 
comedian jackie mason a strong giuliani backer in the jewish 
community that were considered racially offensive 
masons role in the giuliani campaign ended wednesday after the 
village voice reported his remarks 
the ad that rekindled the controversy sends the jewish community 
new years greetings for rosh hashana and asks new yorkers to 
choose their destiny the ad was paid for by friends of 
giuliani and appeared in the algemeiner journal the nations 
largest yiddish newspaper 
the head of the local american jewish committee denounced the 
ad calling it an illdisguised appeal to prejudice 
but officials with giulianis campaign defended it 
this has absolutely nothing to do with race or prejudice 
said ken caruso giulianis deputy campaign manager it has to do 
with who are the candidates political supporters 
george bush is strong on israel and jesse jackson is weak on 
israel caruso said 
the ads banner says let the people of new york choose their 
own destiny and has photographs of republican giuliani with 
president bush and democrat dinkins with jackson a former 
democratic presidential contender 
after the primary sept 12 when dinkins beat incumbent mayor 
edward koch dinkins called giuliani a reagan republican that 
prompted the former us attorney to call him a jackson 
democrat 
what theyre trying to do now is inject racism into the 
campaign and thats unfortunate said haskell lazere president 
of the new york city chapter of the american jewish committee 
the ad was a guilt by association number and a scare 
appeal he said 
dinkins said the ads show it seems pretty clear what hes 
attempting to do he did not elaborate 
the ad reinforces earlier attempts by the giuliani campaign to 
point out dinkins links with jackson 
jacksons disfavor with many jews goes back to a reference in 
1984 to new york as hymietown a remark for which he later 
apologized he also supports palestinian selfdetermination and has 
received support from louis farrakhan of the nation of islam

trying to keep up with mikhail gorbachev on 
flashy arms control proposals is childs play compared to finding 
an opening for arabisraeli negotiations 
the bush administration capitalizing on soviet concessions that 
were brought about by an ailing economy has drawn about even with 
moscow in proposing formulas to cap the nuclear arms race 
a treaty to sharply reduce longrange bombers missiles and 
submarines could be ready for signing at next years summit meeting 
the two sides are not far apart either in their proposals to 
reduce troops tanks and combat aircraft in europe and now 
chemical weapons too 
but when president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii turn to the middle east they are hipdeep in muddle 
the arabs refuse to sign on to an israeli negotiation plan that 
has us support and the israeli government is dubious about an 
egyptian variation that baker thinks might attract other arabs 
bush in new york for a foreign policy address last monday to 
the special session of the united nations general assembly held a 
meeting with israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres on the side 
then baker met wednesday with foreign minister moshe arens and 
in a threeway session on thursday with arens and egyptian foreign 
minister esmet abdelmeguid 
i believe there may be some potential for progress he told 
reporters afterward 
bush did not have to sell the egyptian approach to peres it 
would have been like preaching to the choir 
the head of israels labor party already had accepted some of 
the most controversial egyptian features 
these include a place at the bargaining table for palestinians 
who were deported during the 22month rebellion on the israeliheld 
west bank and in gaza and a prior commitment by israel to 
relinquish most or possibly all of the land egypt and jordan lost 
in the 1967 sixday war 
baker on the other hand had no chance of persuading arens who 
is from the likud coalition headed by yitzhak shamir that the 
egyptian plan is a potential way of getting to negotiations 
in fact a key aide to baker obviously sensitive to shamir and 
arens opposition insisted diplomatically that the 10 points 
advanced by egyptian president hosni mubarak were neither a plan 
nor a proposal he called it a vehicle for negotiations and 
reaffirmed us support for shamirs plan 
the idea is not to antagonize shamir who has described the 
israelipalestinian negotiations mubarak is trying to set up in 
cairo as surrender talks 
shamirs plan calls for participation only by palestinians who 
live on the west bank and gaza and he will not commit israel to 
giving up land for peace 
the negotiations would produce limited selfrule for the 
palestinians after five years a new round of talks would explore 
a lasting settlement yasser arafat the chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization has met with mubarak and has accepted the 
egyptian presidents formula which also would freeze further 
jewish settlements in the territories 
but mubaraks 10 points have split the israeli government 
in a government of 24 ministers you are bound to find 
differences of opinion arens said wednesday after seeing baker 
logically that is true israel is a democracy and there is a 
constant clash of conflicting points of view 
but arens understated the problem it is reaching crisis 
proportions because it concerns how much israel should concede in 
risky negotiations 
the israeli innercabinet the key ministers will meet 
next wednesday in jerusalem to debate mubaraks proposal 
this could produce a compromise between the shamir and mubarak 
formulas bakers hope evidently is that the israelis would be 
willing to go the table with their plan and face palestinians ready 
to negotiate on the basis of the mubarak formula 
baker is trying to muddle through listening and hoping for some 
opening to the bargaining table 
others have harbored the same hope and failed

an investigating panel of the american 
association of university professors says catholic university of 
america violated the rev charles currans academic freedom when it 
barred him from teaching theology at the school because of his 
views on sexual issues 
the panels report published in the association journal 
academe says the university also failed to protect its own freedom 
and that of its faculty in its actions against curran whose 
liberal views on abortion homosexuality and other issues had been 
criticized by the vatican 
the report said the administration and the board of trustees 
for all practical purposes deprived him curran of his tenure 
without due process and without adequate cause after the vatican 
declared him unsuitable to teach catholic theology 
the administration and particularly the board of trustees 
failed in the case of professor curran to exercise their 
responsibility to protect the universitys autonomy and academic 
freedom of the faculty the report of the threemember committee 
concluded 
in late 1986 the vatican ruled that curran who had taught at 
the school for 21 years was not eligible nor suitable to teach 
catholic theology 
curran was suspended in january 1987 though he was never fired 
he sued the university but a district of columbia judge in 
february declined to order his reinstatement as a teacher of 
theology at the school 
he currently teaches at the university of southern california 
the university response which was published with the report 
said that school officials acted properly and that the aaup 
committee disregards the distinct character of catholic theology 
and the unique relationship of the university to the vatican 
the catholic university of america cherishes academic freedom 
but academic freedom is not an absolute the schools reply 
saidacademic freedom may be limited by the religious aims of the 
institution as the committee notes and by the peculiar norms of 
the discipline 
the physicist is not free to ignore the data of the 
laboratory a catholic theologian is not free to disregard church 
teachings which constitute indispensable data for catholic 
theology 
the aaup committees report does not constitute a formal censure 
of the university according to association officials such an 
action could only come from the full aaup convention in june 
this is by no means cut and dried said jordan kurland 
association general secretary there has been keen interest in 
this report 
curran who taught moral theology at catholic university has 
dissented from church leaders on a range of sexual issues 
expressing the views that contraception and sterilization are not 
intrinsically evil and that the church should allow divorce 
in certain circumstances he also has said that under certain 
conditions homosexual acts in the context of a loving 
relationship striving for permanency can in a certain sense be 
objectively and morally acceptable

a dutch painter who was famous before 
rembrandt forgotten for centuries and finally a favorite in 
american homes gets his first big exhibit outside the netherlands 
at the national gallery of art beginning sunday 
frans hals laughing cavalier a happy 17th century 
dutchman in a huge hat looks down from the walls of thousands 
possibly millions of rooms belonging to families who may not know 
the name of hals nobody knows the name of the cavalier 
it is one of the few hals masterpieces not in the exhibit 
seymour slive its cocurator explained that it belongs to the 
wallace collection in london and can not be loaned 
dozens of other museums from ones in san diego to the soviet 
union did send some of their paintings slive saw the soviet loan 
as a sign of the times the soviets who often used to hide their 
religious paintings promptly sent portrayals of st matthew and 
st luke 
last time i tried to get pictures from the soviets for a show 
in the netherlands they arrived the week the show was closing 
slive said 
a professor at harvard university slive is one of the worlds 
leading authorities on hals 
though the show does not have the laughing cavalier it does 
have the merry drinker which looks a lot like it and is 
reproduced almost as often 
it sells more postcards in the amsterdam rijksmuseum than any 
painting except rembrandts night watch slive said thats 
the best sign of popular appeal 
hals was in his 40s when rembrandts first work began to appear 
they lived only a few miles from one another rembrandt in 
amsterdam and hals in haarlem but there is no indication that 
they ever met and not much record of hals at all 
painters arent writers slive said all they ever wrote 
was give me more time to finish and i need money 
one of the few contemporary accounts of hals says he drank 
himself to the gills every night but historians are not sure 
that is so 
both rembrandt and hals are known for their stately portraits 
many of them grouped in the military companies that defended the 
young dutch republic hals belonged to one one he painted is known 
as the meager company because its members lack the big bellies 
seen in so many others 
among the individual portraits is a rare fulllength study of a 
wealthy and obviously proud haarlem merchant willem van 
heythuysen a little more is known of him than of hals he wore 
red satin underwear 
you cant see it in the portrait its in the inventory of 
his property taken after his death slive explained 
hals himself died in poverty in his 80s he came from a modest 
family and his birth date is uncertain though he is known to have 
died in 1666 two of his last great paintings in the exhibit are 
group portraits of the trustees men and women in separate 
pictures who were responsible for a poorhouse 
the exhibit financed by a bank holding company closes dec 31 
before going to the royal academy of arts in london

the soviet union dropped an atomic bomb near its 
own soldiers 35 years ago to test their ability to fight on ground 
contaminated by radiation the defense ministry newspaper disclosed 
friday 
although the official tass news agency reported at the time that 
an atomic test had been carried out there was no mention that 
soldiers were involved said the daily red star 
a real atomic bomb was detonated during a soviet military 
exercise on sept 14 1954 in order to study the effects of the 
explosion and test troops ability to negotiate contaminated 
terrain it said 
after the atomic strike there were not only no landmarks left 
on the terrain but the area itself became unrecognizable 
red star said there were no casualties at the time but it did 
not address possible longterm health problems caused by radiation 
all soviet and us nuclear tests have been underground since 
1963 when the countries signed a treaty banning atomic explosions 
in the atmosphere 
prior to the treaty the united states conducted 100 tests above 
ground and scores of soldiers assigned to the nevada test site 
near las vegas later sought compensation from congress for 
illnesses they said were caused by the tests 
figures on the number of soviet tests carried out are not 
available and there have been no reports of radiation casualties 
red star said it carried the article titled the explosion we 
can now talk about in response to a readers query a technique 
often used by officials to open formerly closed subjects to public 
scrutiny 
the newspaper said the test in the south urals military 
district of central russia was carried out because of the cold war 
and at a time when nato forces in europe were expanding by bringing 
west germany into the defense alliance 
it never occurred to us to question any measure meant to 
bolster the armys battleworthiness and the countrys defense 
capability the newspaper said 
fullsize foxholes and standardfire trenches with overhead 
covers in many places and deep underground shelters with double 
doors were built for the forces equipment and ammunition the 
newspaper said 
red star said soldiers were equipped with gas masks dark 
glasses and chemicalresistant clothing and special 
decontamination centers were established near the blast site 
to limit the spread of radiation and fallout the bomb was 
dropped from an airplane and detonated at an altitude of only 300 
to 500 yards the newspaper said 
those who were in the shelter during the explosion did not see 
it but they all felt the bomb exploding it said some of them 
said there was a kind of thunder a deafening sound 
observers emerged from the shelter to see a huge cloud 
covering half the sky pushed from below by scarlet flames the 
article said 
although no injuries were reported the article said one soldier 
barely escaped blindness and possible death by hurling himself 
facedown into a foxhole as the bomb exploded 
another in the open about six miles from ground zero took 
cover behind a mound of earth and was only slightly frightened 
red star said 
observers saw several tanks among them heavy tanks close to 
the center of the blast some of them had melted and others were 
pushed into the ground others had been hurled dozens of meters and 
some were lying upside down the newspaper said 
everything was covered with stones soil and dead animals 
the test site was chosen because it was virtually unpopulated 
the newspaper reported scientists waited for the right wind 
conditions to prevent fallout from contaminating any villages 
nearby it said 
after the blast red star said there was little radiation 
scientists noted that geiger counters did not react the 
report said one tank commander thought it was malfunctioning 
but the same thing was happening with other geiger counters 
they concluded that because the bomb was dropped from a 
relatively low altitude radiation was confined to a small area 
the report said

an excommunicated elder of the mormon 
churchs hierarchy and some of its scholars are questioning 
leadership and doctrine in a church whose tenets allow little room 
for criticism 
calls for a priesthood open to women appointment of younger 
leaders and a shedding of the institutions authoritarian image 
preceded a departing salvo from the first high church official to 
be excommunicated in 46 years 
the pride and the arrogance and love of control is getting to 
the point that they are saying they are greater than isaiah 
abraham isaac and moses george p lee charged of his former 
brethren after his sept 1 expulsion from the church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints 
lee will not be present when the church convenes its 159th 
semiannual general conference on saturday but many of the faiths 
40000 navajos will be watching for any response by leaders to 
questions raised by lee a navajo about the role of indians in the 
faiths doctrine 
beyond announcing that lee a member of the first quorum of the 
seventy had been excommunicated for apostasy and other conduct 
unbecoming a member of the church the governing first presidency 
and quorum of the twelve apostles declined to elaborate but 
reaffirmed their love for indians 
lee 47 was the only american indian ever appointed a general 
authority a term defining members of the seventy the twelve and 
the threemember presidency headed by president ezra taft benson 
90 a former us agriculture secretary 
lee has been on a spiritual retreat for three weeks he said he 
wanted to fast and pray in the manner of his medicineman father in 
order to sort out his future before leaving he turned down a 
publishers offer of a 150000 book advance and declined to 
encourage others to take up his cause 
lee characterized members of the twelve as proud and greedy men 
who prize power and position over love and charity he also claimed 
they are bent on robbing indians of what his people believe is 
their special standing in mormon scripture 
the allegation is a serious one for a rapidly expanding church 
that maintains more than 35000 fulltime missionaries and has had 
some of its most successful proselyting among latin american 
indians 
i think the fallout of this may reach south of the border 
said ross f peterson coeditor of dialogue a scholarly 
periodical of mormon history belief and literature 
while acknowledging the vast majority of mormons felt lees 
ouster was probably justified peterson said many wrote expressing 
concern about the fact and manner of his erasure from membership 
rolls 
mormons on the navajo indian reservation located in parts of 
arizona new mexico and utah speaking on condition of anonymity 
said church leaders sent from salt lake city to soothe alarm over 
the lee affair had tried to muzzle local leaders and managed only 
to confuse the doctrinal issues 
lees parting broadside recalled themes raised by paul james 
toscano a lawyer and mormon writer in a paper delivered in august 
at an annual gathering of mormon scholars and artists 
toscano blamed the churchs leadership not its critics for 
fostering contention 
toscano said his paper was prompted by april sermons by general 
authorities which in their warnings about alternate voices 
within the church sought to inflict upon us a kind of spiritual 
lobotomy in order to keep us docile and submissive 
mormons are taught that their leaders from founder joseph smith 
to the present are divinely inspired prophets whose pronouncements 
carry the weight of scripture 
edwin b firmage a law professor at the university of utah and 
mormon scholar shocked many church members with his suggestion in 
june that women be ordained to the priesthood

a federal grand jury indicted five men linked to 
racist skinhead groups in connection with vandalism at a jewish 
temple and attacks on blacks and hispanics authorities said today 
this is our first major frontal assault against skinhead 
terrorist activities said michael gillett dallas county 
assistant district attorney 
james p turner an acting assistant attorney general heading 
the justice departments civil rights division announced today 
that a grand jury in dallas handed up the indictment thursday 
the charges against five associates of the dallasbased 
confederate hammerskins stem from attacks in the summer and fall of 
1988 two of the defendants are still being sought by federal 
authorities 
federal authorities believe the hammerskins are a faction of the 
skinhead groups that have been identified in racist attacks in 
several metropolitan areas around the country 
the skinhead subculture emerged in london in the 1960s segments 
of the movement took on nazi overtones in 1985 and since have been 
supported by and associated with the white supremacist aryan youth 
movement and white aryan resistance 
president bush and attorney general dick thornburgh have 
made it clear that prosecutions of this type rank right up there 
with the war on drugs turner said 
he said the threecount indictment names sean christian tarrant 
jon lance jordan michael lewis lawrence christopher barry greer 
and daniel alvis wood 
wood who was arrested in the vandalism on temple shalom and the 
jewish community center in dallas was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison by a state judge after admitting he sprayed swastikas and 
antisemitic slogans at the center he also was fined 5000 
tarrant and greer also are in custody 
barry kowalski an attorney with the civil rights division said 
jordan and lawrence remained at large 
he said at least some of the defendants were from the dallas 
area but declined to give hometowns or ages of the others 
the indictment alleged two separate but related conspiracies to 
commit acts of violence including the vandalism at the jewish 
temple and community center in october 1988 and violence against 
blacks and hispanics at robert e lee park in august 1988 
if convicted all five face 10 years in prison and a 250000 
fine in the two conspiracies and lawrence jordan and wood each 
face an additional count of using a firearm in a violent crime 
kowalski said the park attacks occurred because the skinhead 
group believed robert e lee park was a symbol of white supremacy 
that should not have been frequented by nonwhites he said the 
defendants attacked blacks and hispanics and tried to chase them 
out of the park

the arizona supreme court today brushed aside 
former gov evan mechams bid to persuade the court to restore him 
to office and to order the state to pay him more than 600000 
the court said it had no power to overrule the state senate and 
that even if it did the violations of which mecham was convicted 
did fall in the category of impeachable offenses 
the controversial firstterm republican was removed from office 
april 4 1988 when the arizona state senate convicted him on civil 
impeachment charges he misused money in a state protocol fund and 
tried to obstruct an investigation 
even if this court had jurisdiction to intervene and prevent 
impeachment there is almost unanimous agreement that offenses 
are impeachable when they involve serious abuse of official 
power the supreme court wrote in an unsigned 50 opinion 
this court has no power to substitute its view on these 
questions for that of the senate nor to dictate to the senate 
either before or after the impeachment trial the rules and methods 
to be followed by the senate in reaching its conclusions 
mecham was out of his office and unavailable for comment an 
aide said his attorney scheduled an afternoon news conference and 
declined to comment in advance of it 
during a hearing sept 21 mechams lawyer told the state 
supreme court that the protocol fund statute under which mecham was 
convicted was drafted unconstitutionally and that senators were 
allowed to vote on the charges without having heard all the 
evidence or agreeing on what the exact charges were 
the state attorney generals office urging the supreme court 
not to intervene argued that senators voted to oust mecham because 
of his general course of conduct and not because of any particular 
statute 
also a lawyer for the officer said impeachment trials are 
political in nature and courts have no right to interfere as long 
as lawmakers follow the few rules for impeachment set forth in the 
arizona constitution

a soviet menagerie of monkeys rats fish and 
insects returned safely to earth on friday after a 14day space 
mission that tested the effects of weightlessness and cosmic rays 
on living things 
the soviet news agency tass said results of the bion9 
international mission which began with a sept 15 launch would 
help scientists plan for long manned spaceflights 
nearly 80 experiments were carried out with participation of 
scientists from nearly 20 countries including the united states 
france canada and the european space agency tass said 
the kosmos2044 landing module touched down softly south of the 
city of kustanay in the soviet republic of kazakhstan 1000 miles 
southeast of moscow tass said 
the two monkeys named zhakonya and zabiyaka were to be brought 
to moscow later friday for a checkup an initial examination after 
landing showed the pair had withstood the strains of the mission 
well tass said 
the deputy director of the moscow institute of medicobiological 
problems yevgeny ilyin said during the mission that studies were 
made on the impact of short and longterm weightlessness 
artificial gravitation ionizing rays and other forms of radiation 
on living things tass said 
the results of the monkeys flight will help specialists 
understand more about how organisms adapt to conditions in space 
and how to protect humans during short and longterm spaceflights

each night asian fishing trawlers play out 
thousands of miles of invisible monofilament nylon nets in the 
midpacific ocean to snare seafood for oriental markets 
but the haul made by illegal driftnetters modernday 
ecological pirates could dictate the future of a species close to 
the hearts of idaho anglers steelhead trout 
the relationship between the oceanic trawlers and the fish 
associated with idahos effervescent mountain streams is as tangled 
as the nets unraveled nightly 
the environmental group earthtrust from hawaii documented about 
1500 driftnet boats operating in the pacific in 1988 of those 
30 to 60 boats were illegally taking fish and even the legal boats 
destroy a variety of species caught in their nets said wayne 
lewis who directs driftnet enforcement efforts for the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration in seattle 
those pirate ships cover up their names and markings he 
said theyre crooks theyre going out and stealing fish 
the technology that put japan south korea and taiwan at the 
forefront of many international markets is evident in the drift 
nets they hang from floats and catch anything down to about 40 
feet the nets are strong as wire and nearly transparent 
they are rolled out in the evening and stretch up to 60 miles 
per craft in the morning they are hauled in and workers pick off 
the fish 
the body count also includes thousands of drowned porpoises sea 
birds seals and even dead whales strangled by a plastic noose 
earthtrust estimates that fish and mammals face a curtain of 
death about 30000 miles long 
even if the snares are cut and set adrift they continue to pull 
in a catch as ghost nets and steelhead the migratory trout 
from idahos mountain streams are directly in the drift nets path 
the midpacific features a warm flow of water that attracts 
fishing boats seeking red squid and other target species but 
steelhead and salmon also are found in pockets of cold water and 
catching them is illegal said dexter pitman anadromous fish 
coordinator for the idaho department of fish and game anadromous 
refers to fish that go from salt water to fresh water to spawn 
such as salmon shad and steelhead 
the warmwater species run smack dab into the coldwater 
species he said its hard to set regulations for the pockets 
of cold water that are upwelling 
idahos chinook salmon usually follow the coast to alaska while 
steelhead migrate to the ocean south of alaskas aleutian islands 
the illegal driftnet boats may stray 400 miles north of the 
international boundaries to catch salmon in that area 
the number of fall steelhead returning to idaho is up somewhat 
from last year because cooler weather has caused them to swim 
upriver faster but the population of fish now plying idaho waters 
is far smaller than in the past officials say 
the illegal catches of migratory us and canadian fish came to 
light in 19861987 during a crackdown by lewis agency on fish 
laundering on the west coast 
tons of salmon were being transferred from taiwan to seattle or 
san francisco then given fraudulent us documentation so they 
could be legally shipped to japan which has outlawed taiwanese 
imports of highseas salmon 
in one breakthrough noaa covertly arranged to buy 500 metric 
tons of salmon from a taiwanese merchant lewis said as 140 tons 
were being transferred from two taiwanese fishing boats to a hired 
refrigerator ship south of the aleutians coast guard ships 
appeared on the horizon 
one boat was chased all the way to taiwan of the 140 metric 
tons of fish found 14 tons were steelhead lewis said the 
merchant was arrested at a bank when he tried to deposit his take 
pitman said wrangling between northwest states and canadian 
provinces over the rights to migratory fish has dissolved in the 
face of a greater threat from the drift nets 
representatives of the two nations met recently in british 
columbia and agreed to study the problem a specific analysis of 
the driftnetters effect on salmon and steelhead will be available 
by late winter pitman said 
we know idaho steelhead are involved in it he said but 
we dont know how much 
the united states has concluded three agreements with the 
pacific rim nations to allow observers on the driftnet boats 
lewis said some already are in place on japanese craft 
but arranging observers is difficult the united states must 
gain the permission of the captain or country of origin and the 
pirate ships dont want to be spotted let alone carry an observer 
lewis said 
the technology that produced the drift nets has outstripped the 
monitoring efforts to stop them pitman said conservationists are 
worried that robbing the seas of some species could cause a 
wholesale collapse of the entire biological chain 
said pitman the ocean like everything else has its limits

archbishop robert runcie leader of the 
worlds 70 million anglicans began his first official visit to the 
vatican on friday by embracing pope john paul ii and urging greater 
unity with the roman catholic church 
runcie was following in the footsteps of three previous anglican 
leaders who traveled to the vatican since 1960 as part of an effort 
to reunite the churches that split in the 16th century over the 
vaticans refusal to give king henry viii a divorce 
im full of hope that we shall be able to build on the 
understanding and unity which we already enjoy between the anglican 
and catholic church runcie told reporters on arrival at romes 
leonardo da vinci airport 
he added however that he expected straightforward and frank 
conversations about the relationship between the two churches 
runcie the archbishop of canterbury met privately with the 
polishborn pope for 50 minutes friday evening the meeting had 
been billed by vatican officials as a simple exchange of greetings 
but it appeared to last longer than expected 
the religious leaders embraced at the beginning and end of their 
talks according to a vatican spokesman the rev giovanni dercole 
after the encounter in the popes library the anglican leader 
was the guest of honor at a vatican reception in a brief speech 
he praised the 196265 second vatican council for emphasizing 
respect for other faiths and urging religious unity 
the anglican and roman catholic churches have made major strides 
in recent years on reconciling their teachings on such matters as 
salvation and the leadership of the pope anglican leaders say they 
think the churches will unite in the 21st century 
however a major disagreement has developed over the ordination 
of women the anglican church allows members such as the us 
episcopalians to ordain women priests 
john paul who strongly supports the catholic churchs policy on 
an allmale priesthood has declared that ordaining women seems to 
effectively block the path to the mutual recognition of 
ministries 
both sides said runcies fourday trip would probably not yield 
dramatic developments but would simply continue the series of 
contacts between the churches 
the vaticans pontifical council for promoting christian unity 
noted in a statement that runcie was paying a return visit for the 
popes historic 1982 trip to canterbury cathedral mother church of 
the 27province anglican communion 
runcie and john paul have met previously in africa india and 
assisi italy as well as canterbury however runcies visit was 
his first to rome as leader of the anglican church the worlds 
largest group of christians after the estimated 850 million roman 
catholics 
the archbishop of canterburys visit began amid a mild 
controversy caused by runcies declaration to an italian journalist 
that the church of england might recognize papal authority in a 
united church 
the view had already been stated by a vaticananglican 
commission that has been discussing unification for many years but 
it drew the fire of church of england evangelicals who oppose unity 
with rome

the government announced friday it 
will extend its unilateral ceasefire with sinhalese militants by 
three days in a bid to curb ethnic violence that has claimed at 
least 16000 lives in six years 
a threeday ceasefire that started wednesday was scheduled to 
expire at 6 am saturday but president ranasinghe premadasa met 
with opposition leaders and announced it would continue 
a government communique said friday that 14 people had been 
killed in southern sri lanka the sinhalese heartland since the 
ceasefire began the victims were government supporters or 
security personnel 
the communique also said at least 14 government offices 10 
stateowned buses seven post offices and a factory had been set on 
fire during the same period 
the sinhalesedominated government ordered the threeday 
ceasefire saying it hoped sinhalese radicals would end their 
violence and open peace talks 
sinhalese militants have not responded to the call 
meanwhile indian peacekeeping forces clashed with tamil 
guerrillas in northeastern sri lanka breaking a 10dayold 
ceasefire and killing five militants military officials said 
the officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said the clash between indian soldiers and tamil guerrillas took 
place thursday in the northeastern town of mullaitivu 120 miles 
north of colombo 
five rebels were killed and five others were wounded they said 
two indian soldiers also were hurt in the first major attack since 
the peacekeeping forces called an indefinite ceasefire sept 20 
military officials said the largest and most militant tamil 
group the liberation tigers of tamil eelam provoked the clash 
india deployed an estimated 47000 soldiers to sri lanka in july 
1987 to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending the tamil rebellion 
the new delhi government has said the remaining 42000 troops will 
be gone by dec 31 
india which mediated the peace accord became involved in sri 
lankas ethnic problems because 60 million tamils living in 
southern india are sympathetic to the rebel cause 
the accord offered the tamils limited autonomy if they would 
give up their demand for an independent homeland in the northeast 
and surrender their weapons but the tamil tigers rejected the 
accord and turned their guns on indian soldiers 
the presence of indian troops also triggered a violent backlash 
by sinhalese radicals who claimed the government offered too many 
concessions to the tamils and compromised the countrys sovereignty 
by inviting foreign troops to sri lankan soil 
ramils who are mostly hindu comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people they contend they are denied jobs and education 
by the predominantly buddhist sinhalese who make up 75 percent of 
the population and control the government and military 
at least 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
been killed since the tamil insurgency started in 1983 another 
5000 people have died since sinhalese radicals launched their 
antigovernment campaign two years ago

a fireman atop a fire truck that speed 
across the path of an amtrak train into a collision that killed two 
and injured 150 said friday the last thing he remembers is mowing 
his lawn 
michael kirk 21 thinks he was riding in the jump seat directly 
behind the driver of the catlett volunteer fire department truck 
when it crossed the tracks 
officials have declined to speculate on the cause of the 
collision thursday evening about 50 miles from washington dc 
i dont remember anything kirk said by telephone friday 
from his bed at the washington hospital center the last thing i 
remember i was mowing the grass then i was here 
lucy caldwell a state police spokeswoman said the firefighters 
were responding to a report of a blaze near a home on the other 
side of the tracks 
amtrak officials said the crescent en route from new york to 
atlanta and new orleans sounded its horn when it approached the 
crossing of the private drive alongside virginia 28 
there was no crossing bar and no warning light at the crossing 
ms caldwell said the fire truck had its air horn siren and 
flashing red lights on at the time of the collision 
two of the five firefighters on the truck were killed at least 
150 of the trains 379 passengers were injured most of the 
injuries to train passengers were minor 
kirk who joined the fire department about four months ago was 
in fair condition i feel all right just pretty sore he 
said 
frankie herndon another firefighter said he felt the truck 
cross the track and the next thing i know i woke up and i was in 
the hospital herndon was treated at a hospital and released 
the third survivor on the truck ernest colbert was in serious 
condition at fairfax hospital 
firefighters mark miller 23 and matt smith 22 both of 
catlett died at the scene 
were talking to witnesses to the crew to see why it 
happened said rachel halterman of the national transportation 
safety board 
the federal investigation is limited ms halterman said 
because the accident involved a highway crossing state police are 
conducting a full investigation 
i was looking outside a window and i saw a fire engine then a 
split second later i saw flames shoot past my window said 
charles horton jr 18 of new jersey 
the collision destroyed the truck scattering bits of the 
vehicle along the roadside 
i was flipping over and over said freddie mungo a 
conductor on the 16car train i heard a big bang it was like 
rocks flying a big loud crunching sound and the train just 
stopped my worst nightmare 
railroad crews worked through the night to clear the tracks ms 
caldwell said about 470 yards of track were destroyed 
heavy equipment including cranes and bulldozers were being 
used to move the 12 cars and two locomotives that derailed after 
the accident said wick leatherwood an amtrak spokesman in 
washington 
lengthy schedule delays were not expected he said delays were 
running about two hours friday as traffic was rerouted

the communist party leader jiang zemin 
condemned the wests rotten lifestyles and predicted the 
triumph of socialism over capitalism as he opened celebrations 
friday marking 40 years of communist rule 
we are full of confidence in our socialist cause and are sure 
of a bright communist future for mankind he said in his first 
major speech since taking office in june after a power struggle 
triggered by prodemocracy protests 
jiangs 80minute speech televised live from the great hall of 
the people began a weekend of activities that will climax with 
dances and fireworks on sunday national day but he gave short 
shrift to celebrating the achievements made since mao tsetungs 
oct 1 1949 proclamation of the peoples republic of china 
instead he focused grimly on the themes that have preoccupied 
the leadership in the past few months stamping out western liberal 
influences and maintaining vigilance against antisocialist ideas 
only socialism can save china he said in an unrelentingly 
hardline speech filled with oldfashioned ideological rhetoric 
that had gone out of style in recent years 
we can borrow some of the methods used by capitalist 
countries but we cannot copy them we must clearly distinguish 
between socialist democracy and capitalist democracy extremist 
democracy and anarchism 
the leaders who used the army to crush the studentled spring 
democracy movement have insisted the students demands for a more 
responsive accountable government amounted to extremist 
democracy 
relatively liberal officials such as thenparty chief zhao 
ziyang who favored compromising with the students were ousted in 
the power struggle 
martial law imposed in beijing during the may protests remains 
in effect and already tight security has been tightened further 
for the holiday soldiers with automatic rifles guard beijings 
tiananmen square the center of the student protests where the main 
weekend festivities are to be held 
the army issued a new martial law order last week warning 
against any attempts to sabotage the celebrations but the 
government has not said if any threats have been delivered 
it was the capitals first national day under martial law and 
the red banners bunting and flowers in the center of beijing did 
little to stir up enthusiasm 
national day bah one shopkeeper said when asked how he 
planned to spend the holiday sunday 
some people are anxious because there are soldiers around and 
they dont know what they can say and where they can go so they 
decided this year forget it they dont care about national day 
one chinese woman said 
jiangs speech attended by more than 10000 invited party and 
government leaders model workers and soldiers was not publicized 
in advance possibly as a security measure 
the audience applauded 14 times cued each time when jiang 
raised his voice in a flourish and then paused but the 62yearold 
party leader rarely looked up 
he never paused for a drink and his voice soon showed the 
strain nearly cracking when he closed with a call for the 
greater victories of socialism 
the top party and government leaders sat behind jiang on a stage 
at the front of the hall decorated with a huge national emblem and 
the dates 19491989 
senior leader deng xiaoping whom jiang praised as the partys 
mainstay did not attend deng 85 and reportedly in ill 
health skips most public government and party functions although 
he has made several public appearances in the past few weeks 
jiang said the party triumphed over antisocialist forces in the 
studentled mass protests but urged we must carry the struggle 
through to the end isolate and attack the handful of hostile 
elements make a thorough investigation into all 
counterrevolutionary scheming remove hidden perils and draw 
profound lessons 
he praised the army for its role in ending the protests saying 
without the peoples army the people would have nothing the 
army killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people when it 
rolled into beijing in june with tanks and automatic weapons to 
retake tiananmen square from the protesters 
the newborn socialist system has experienced twists and turns 
in the course of its development jiang declared however 
history has proven the socialist system has great vigor and 
vitality the replacement of capitalism with socialism is the great 
historical trend 
he accused international reactionary forces of seeking to 
subvert the chinese government by fostering blind worship of the 
west and spreading western capitalist political and economic 
styles and rotten thinking and lifestyles 
the class struggle continues he warned every party member 
especially the leaders must maintain a high degree of vigilance

federal authorities said they made the 
biggest seizure of cocaine on record at a warehouse today finding 
at least 20 tons of the drug valued conservatively at 2 
billion 
about 10 million in cash also was seized said ralph lochridge 
a spokesman for the drug enforcement administration 
he said at least 20 tons was found and authorities thought they 
might locate even more 
this seizure should put to rest any further speculation as to 
whether los angeles is in fact the major pathway for cocaine 
entering the country and has in fact become a major distribution 
center in the united states lochridge said 
lochridge said it was by far the biggest cocaine seizure in 
history the domestic record until now is 8700 pounds a little 
more than 4 tons seized in hollowedout picnic furniture in fort 
lauderdale fla in november 1987 in colombia there is a 12ton 
seizure on record 
the cocaine was seized at a warehouse in a light industrial area 
of sylmar a uiet mostly residential section of los angeles in the 
northern san fernando valley about 25 miles from downtown 
the warehouse is on a treelined street near the san gabriel 
foothills across the street are offices for the cocacola bottling 
co next door is a heart pacemaker manufacturer and a hydraulic 
pump supplier the warehouse is two miles from interstate 5 the 
main northsouth thoroughfare in california 
john m zienter the dea special agent in charge for los 
angeles said at a news conference today that the street value of 
the haul could be as high as 10 times the wholesale price of 2 
billion 
we are trying to send a message to the colombian cartels that 
were are not going to allow them to take over the united states 
zienter said 
three men whose names were not immediately released were 
arrested for investigation of conspiring to distribute cocaine 
lochridge said 
they claimed to be mexican but their accents were south 
american he said 
he said the dea had been investigating and conducting intense 
surveillance for a year before moving in about midnight 
its about 2 billion in cocaine and thats a very 
conservative estimate lochridge said twenty tons nothing 
like that has ever been done before 
lochridges 2 billion estimate was based on a wholesale price 
of 100 a gram for pure cocaine however based on los angeles 
police techniques to calculate cocaine street value 170250 per 
pound the value of the drug would be nearly 7 billion 
the dea and the us attorneys office estimate that more than 
half the cocaine distributed in the country now floods in through 
los angeles colombian drug groups are bringing it across the 
border from mexico and los angeles street gangs are distributing 
it in more than 40 cities across the country they have said 
cash seizures from the drug trade totaled more than 100 million 
last year in los angeles topping miami for the first time the 
citys federal reserve surplus one way of measuring illegal money 
laundering has jumped by more than 2000 percent in five years 
to 38 billion last year 
the colombian cocaine cartels have marched into california and 
have organized the state with a thoroughness the mafia could only 
have dreamed of state attorney general john van de kamp said in 
a speech last month

the bush administration is cutting off funds 
for usbased offices of the nicaraguan contras as part of a 
continuing effort to encourage the rebel political leaders to 
relocate to central america us officials said friday 
one official asking not to be identified said the move mostly 
affects the contra office in miami where there are not many more 
than 10 ustaxpayer financed staff workers that figure is down 
considerably from several years ago when rebel political operations 
in the united states had strong us government backing 
but with a political process under way inside nicaragua and 
political leaders developing from within the ranks of the contra 
fighters the bush administration has been encouraging the 
usbased rebel leadership to return to the region 
the administrations policy has drawn criticism from some contra 
leaders that the state department is trying to undermine the 
rebels traditional political leadership 
a resistance official told the washington times that the 
decision effectively dooms the contras chances of political 
survival 
for me this is the end of any hope to achieve democracy in 
nicaragua said the resistance official who asked not to be 
identified theyre leaving the troops without a voice 
the state department suggesting that the fund cutoff was not 
controversial said friday we understand the resistance is 
moving its political offices to central america so as to better 
represent the combatants 
it added that the resistance commanders will make arrangements 
to have the duties carried out at the contra offices performed by 
others 
officials declined to say how much money went into the miami 
operation but they added that funding will be spent in the future 
on offices the rebels have set up in several central american 
countries 
some rebel political leaders returned to nicaragua several 
months ago to take part in the process leading up to the february 
25 national elections 
one of the holdouts has been the miamibased veteran rebel 
leader adolfo calero who has said that the state department is 
embarked on a course that not only will strip nicaragua of all hope 
for a democratic outcome but also will eventually damage us 
security interests

halt friday to regional antislovenian protests saying 
yugoslavias integrity was not jeopardized by local constitutional 
changes includyvg the right to sesede 
the conciliaoy statement came a day after rallies in the 
republic of serbia protested constitutional amendments adopted on 
wednesday in slovenia 
serbias leadership favors greater central control over the six 
republics in yugoslavia to make the federation more efficient 
the presidency stresses its determination to implement the 
federal constitution in the whole territory of yugoslavia and 
that the current problems slovenias amendments will be solved by 
legal means said the statement carried by the state tanjug news 
agency 
the countrys institutions are protecting the functioning of 
yugoslavias constitutional and political system and there is no 
need for protests of citizens and public manifestations 
the presidency said it was up to the constitutional court in 
belgrade to rule on the constitutionality of the slovenian 
amendments 
stipe suvar croatias representative in the collective 8member 
presidency was quoted as ruling out a military option to resolve 
the dispute 
nobody has the right to raise suspicions that martial law may 
be introduced in this country except in case of grave hardship 
broad civil unrest or an armed uprising suvar told a meeting in 
zagreb on thursday 
the slovenian daily dnevnik said friday the socalled 
controversial amendments shall bring nothing tangibly new 
they represent solely a defensive mechanism from threats and 
pressures and a legitimate right of every nation to safeguard its 
dignity and integrity 
slovenian authorities say the small northern republic has no 
intention to secede and that the amendments merely provide an 
added sense of security for the 2 million slovenes who make up 
about 8 percent of yugoslavias population

slovenian statehood a slovenian liberation organization was formed 
under italian occupation on oct 3 1941

a filmmaker said friday he may never 
show his controversial documentary titicut follies which 
depicts brutality in a mental hospital despite a judges ruling 
allowing it to be shown 
after a 22year ban on public viewing of titicut follies 
which shows atrocities at bridgewater state hospital in 1966 
suffolk superior judge andrew gill meyer ruled thursday the film 
could be shown if the inmates faces were blurred 
but filmmaker frederick wiseman 59 said friday that will never 
happen 
technically theres no way the faces could be blurred he 
said in an interview at zipporah films but even if it were 
possible i wouldnt do it it wouldnt be a film it would look 
terrible 
wiseman said he plans to appeal the judges decision and said he 
blames politics for the controversy originally surrounding the 
film showing conditions at the state hospital that houses 
prisoners deemed criminally insane 
i was disappointed he said i thought after 22 years why 
cant people be allowed to see a film about a prison thats been 
poorly run it seems to me taxpayers should see the kind of 
institution their state is running 
wiseman said that after the film was first made state officials 
such as thenlt gov elliot richardson chickened out and 
didnt support the publics right to see it 
all of sudden they became concerned about the inmates right to 
privacy which was at odds with any concern over the conditions the 
inmates lived in at bridgewater said wiseman the state used 
the issue of the individuals right to privacy to cover up the 
snakepit that bridgewater was 
richardson was not immediately available for comment 
the 85minute black and white film shows often horrifying 
conditions at the hospital originally built in 1852 
some scenes depict nude men in bare cells being mocked by 
sadistic guards at least one inmate shown in the film was kept 
naked in a cell for 17 years one man is shown being force fed as 
he lies on a table and a liquid is poured down a rubber hose shoved 
into his nose the film has no narrator 
it was ordered withheld from the public six weeks after its new 
york debut on grounds it violated the privacy of the 62 inmates 
featured 
but in recent years state officials have backed wisemans right 
to show the film some said they would welcome the chance to let 
the public know that conditions have changed at bridgewater 
unfortunately said wiseman the judge still believes the 
inmates should be protected 
though the film cannot be shown in public forums it has been 
shown to hundreds of thousands of people over the years 
wiseman said college instructors can order a print of the film for 
150 as long as they sign affidavits that the people who are 
viewing the film are within the range of those allowed to see it in 
the original court order 
in that decision the only people allowed to see the film were 
doctors lawyers legislators people interested in custodial care 
and students in related fields but not the general public 
since titicut follies wiseman has shot 24 films in 14 
different states they include 1968s high school a film about 
a large urban high school juvenile court made in 1973 
model made in 1980 about the modeling industry and 
missile made in 1987 about the air force officers who control 
the buttons on minutemen missiles

a federal judge said friday that irancontra 
figure richard secord is not entitled to ronald reagans diaries 
for his upcoming criminal trial 
secord filed a request earlier this week for the diaries and a 
wide array of other material prompting objections from the office 
of independent counsel lawrence walsh 
associate independent counsel reid weingarten complained that 
the request was far too broad and us district court judge aubrey 
robinson agreed telling secords lawyer tom green that you 
have asked for everything under the kitchen sink 
i tell you he is not getting the reagan diaries robinson 
said of secords request 
green did not press the issue of the diaries but said secord is 
entitled to material showing a number of covert activities he was 
engaged in on behalf of the reagan administration 
one of 12 criminal charges against secord is that he conspired 
to pay illegal gratuities to former national security council aide 
oliver north the gratuities were to encourage north to continue in 
his nsc post so that secord would continue to receive business in 
connection with secretly resupplying the nicaraguan contras and the 
administrations iran arms initiative 
green said he is entitled to show the extent of the relationship 
between north and secord and to try to prove that if gratuities 
were paid the reason had nothing to do with the contras or iran 
green promised to try to narrow his request for documents by 
next wednesday 
separately former national security adviser john poindexter 
facing trial in the irancontra scandal next year has said he 
plans to subpoena diaries of both reagan and president bush

house and senate negotiators agreed friday to 
bar federal funding for art deemed to be obscene and lacking in 
significant literary or artistic merit 
the provision represents a weakening of a senatepassed measure 
backed by sen jesse helms rnc that called for banning federal 
aid for art that is obscene or indecent or that denigrates 
a religion race ethnic background age group or handicap 
the compromise ended the conferees work clearing a major 
roadblock in the way of agreement on an 11 billion measure to fund 
interior and cultural programs for the new fiscal year that begins 
monday it would deny support to certain art that depicts sexual 
acts sadomasochism homoeroticism or the sexual exploitation of 
children 
the conferees borrowing from the benchmark 1973 supreme court 
decision on obscenity agreed that the works must lack significant 
literary artistic political or scientific merit to be denied 
funding 
the decision on whether a work is obscene would be made by the 
national endowment for the arts 
the restrictions would last a year and negotiators provided 
250000 for a commission to study how government arts grants are 
awarded 
i dont know if its a victory for anybody said rep sidney 
yates dill chief democratic negotiator 
im not fully pleased with it but its a way of resolving 
differences between the house and senate said sen james a 
mcclure rida 
the controversy was sparked when conservatives objected to 
photographs shown at two exhibitions sponsored by the nea one 
exhibited robert mapplethorpe photographs depicting children in 
erotic poses and homosexual and sadomasochistic themes and another 
displayed an andres serrano photo of a crucifix in a jar of urine 
the southeastern center for contemporary art in winstonsalem 
nc showed the serrano work and the institute for contemporary 
art at the university of pennsylvania showed the mapplethorpe 
photographs 
it had been proposed that both organizations be banned for five 
years but negotiators agreed that they instead would be put on 
probation for a year and that the nea would have to report to 
congress any grants to them 
earlier friday the senate voted 6531 urging the housesenate 
negotiators to adopt legislation barring federal assistance for 
obscene materials depicting some sexual themes 
we do know in our hearts that there are community values that 
we all share and we must uphold as policymakers and americans 
said sen wyche fowler dga 
on july 26 with few members in the chamber the senate adopted 
the original version of the helms restrictions on a voice vote but 
shortly before midnight thursday lawmakers refused on a 6235 vote 
to reaffirm the july action 
thursdays vote clearly worried many legislators who wondered 
openly about how it might be used by future election campaign 
opponents 
what 30second ad might come out of this sen patrick 
leahy dvt said was a lively topic of conversation among his 
colleagues the answer he said was a commercial stating 
senator soandso voted for pornography 
fifty democrats and 15 republicans voted for the weaker 
restrictions while 28 republicans and three democrats opposed them 
the house passed legislation cutting the endowments 17 
billion budget by 45000 but it contained no new standards for 
artwork that can receive federal support 
meanwhile the senate confirmed john e frohnmayer a trial 
lawyer from portland ore as nea chairman 
frohnmayer 47 confirmed on a voice vote was critical of the 
helms amendment when he appeared before the senate labor and human 
resources committee this week 
i think that the problem of intrusion and the difficulty 
in making unfettered artistic judgments would be most difficult to 
handle under the helms amendment he said

farmers who produce corn and other feed grains 
in 1990 will have the same acreage setaside requirements as they 
had this year agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced 
friday 
the acreage reduction program or arp for corn sorghum and 
barley will carry an idling requirement of 10 percent of the 
farmers base acreage and oats 5 percent 
yeutter said feed grain stockpiles should be adequate to 
maintain our competitive position in the world market while 
providing adequate supplies at reasonable prices to our domestic 
feed grain consumers 
but he said the oats arp was set at a different rate than corn 
and barley in 1988 and 1989 and that this is being done again for 
1990 to make oats planting more competitive with the other crops 
the corn target price for 1990 was announced at 275 per 
bushel down from 284 this year sorghum was set at 261 per 
bushel compared with 270 barley 236 per bushel compared 
with 243 and oats 145 against 150 
under the program when market prices fall below the targets 
farmers can get deficiency payments to make up the difference 
between market levels and price support loan rates whichever are 
higher 
loan rates or the amount farmers can borrow from the goverment 
using their crops as collateral were also announced corn loans 
were set at 157 per bushel down from 165 for 1989 other feed 
grain loans were lowered accordingly 
signup for the 1990 crop programs will be held at county offices

senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and senate 
labor committee chairman edward m kennedy dmass said they 
would seek consideration of a measure mandating establishment of a 
threeperson commission to study the work stoppage and make 
recommendations for its solution 
it is long past time for congress to act kennedy said 
since march senate republicans have been blocking debate on 
housepassed legislation requiring president bush to appoint an 
emergency board to recommend a way to end the walkout bush has 
refused to appoint a board and threatened to veto the bill saying 
unions and management should solve the dispute themselves 
democrats scheduled a vote for tuesday on whether to force a 
debate on the bill they said if successful they would then 
substitute unionbacked language creating a commission with one 
member each appointed by bush mitchell and house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash 
the strike against eastern began march 4 led by machinists but 
bolstered by pilots unhappy with owner frank lorenzo five days 
later the airline filed for protection from creditors under 
federal bankruptcy laws 
democrats pulled the bill off the senate floor in april when it 
appeared that former baseball commissioner peter ueberroth would 
purchase the carrier 
eastern is continuing its efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy 
court the airline has said it plans to emerge as a carrier 
onethird its former size it has been rehiring hundreds of pilots 
who have crossed picket lines and training new crews 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said republicans will

another investigation but after consultation with administration 
leaders we determined that was not in the interests of eastern or

british and chinese officials on friday concluded 
three days of blunt talks about hong kongs future and china held 
that sending red army troops there after 1997 is an internal matter 
both countries reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement 
under which hong kong is to retain its capitalist system for 50 
years after the british colony reverts to chinese rule in less than 
eight years 
but at separate news conferences they acknowledged they 
basically disagree about what caused hong kong residents 
confidence in chinas pledges to be shaken 
it was the joint liaison groups first meeting since the 
military crackdown on prodemocracy students in beijing in june a 
july meeting was canceled 
it was an unusual not to say an exceptional meeting said 
british delegation chief robin mclaren a foreign office 
undersecretary 
there was some pretty straight talk each side set out very 
clearly its own view of the situation both sides agreed that 
there is a problem of confidence in hong kong we continue to 
differ about the cause of that situation 
ke zaishuo a chinese ambassador leading his delegation told 
reporters i have to admit there are some major differences 
between us on matters of important principle 
ke said the right to post troops in hong kong is symbolic of 
the sovereignty of china and is an internal affair of china 
he said suggestions that restrictions should be placed on how 
many troops of the peoples liberation army could be sent to hong 
kong or on the scope of their authority are quite wrong 
a british official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity reminded the chinese that hong kong residents were 
sensitive about the prospect of troops after the crackdown on 
protesters centered in tiananmen square and urged china to pay 
attention to those sensitivities 
many of hong kongs bettereducated and wealthier citizens are 
fleeing the colony taking their skills and money with them or are 
obtaining other passports as a backup in case they want to flee 
britain also wants china to agree to more specific conditions 
under which a state of emergency could be declared in hong kong 
the present specificiation says only in time of turmoil 
ke reiterated chinese objections to reports of what happened on 
june 34 when troops killed hundreds as they moved to recapture 
tiananmen square from protesting students 
he said chinese authorities put down a counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
because of the onesided reports the distorted reports and 
also because of some rumors there was some alarm in the community 
of hong kong ke said 
the officials will meet again in hong kong dec 58

africa this year far fewer than in recent years when more than 100 
people were hanged annually more than 200 people mostly black 
men remain on death row

18 days before the united democratic front and other organizations 
declared they would ignore the banning orders 
vlok signed the release order for valli moosa it prohibits him 
from being in the company of more than seven other people for any 
purpose talking to the news media leaving johannesburg taking

secretary appearing at a news conference with checchi said the 
new owners were exceptionally qualified to expand northwests 
operations and improve its quality of service 
checchi disagreed with the departments conclusion that klms 
400 million equity interest in nwa would put the foreign carrier 
in a position to exercise control over northwest thereby 
depriving northwest of its us citizenship status 
we do not agree said checchi that klm is or has ever 
been in a position to exercise any actual control over nwa 
klm provided 57 percent of the 705 million in equity checchi 
raised to buy northwest but officially owns just 5 percent of the 
airline as most of its interest is in nonvoting stock 
under the agreement with the transportation department 
northwest must cut klms equity share to 25 percent within six 
months and eliminate a threemember advisory committee the dutch 
airline would have controlled 
klm is allowed to keep its seat on northwests 12member board 
but the its representative cannot participate in some sensitive 
decisions 
klm in a statement from amsterdam said the airline joined with 
checchi in the deal because of the need for new strategies to 
increase competition in international aviation 
klms agreements with wings holdings were drafted on a 
conservative basis so as to guarantee that northwest would remain 
an american carrier with american management and with american 
crews flying american aircraft on american routes the statement 
said 
a senior transportation department official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said checchi has the option of either 
having klm withdraw 224 million of its investment or increasing 
total equity in the airline so klms share is cut to 25 percent 
checchi said he already has had several offers and saw no 
problem with finding new investors 
the agreement with the transportation department also requires 
regular reports on northwests finances a reflection of department 
concern for the 31 million debt the takeover imposed on the 
carrier

colombian eads with 4 grafpresident virgilio barco told 
the general assembly on friday there must be no safe haven for 
drug traffickers and urged all nations to sign a treaty allowing 
seizure of their bank accounts and property 
so far only the bahamas has signed the vienna convention on 
narcotics trafficking under which signatory nations would also 
cooperate to seize smugglers ships and planes in transit 
we a community of nations find ourselves under assault from 
an internahooters perched on the roof of the dag 
hammarskjold library 
i am here to lay out the stark realities of this war against 
drug trafficking barco said in his speech 
in colombia the casualties of our struggle have been mounting 
for some time a month ago we suffered the tragic assassination of 
one of our finest national leaders luis carlos galan a popular 
presidential candidate 
but our war on drugs has been taking its toll for years he 
added we have lost 12 supreme court justices our attorney 
general and minister of justice 
we have lost members of congress and mayors scores of 
journalists thousands of soldiers and policemen and tens of 
thousands of colombian citizens who were committed to the cause of 
democracy he said 
drug users create the demand for narcotics which leads to the 
killing of people in colombia and other nations where drugs are 
grown processed and shipped barco said 
no doubt somebody a few blocks from this general assembly 
hall in one of this citys fashionable neighborhoods taking 
cocaine in the civilized calm of his living room would balk at 
this description

those colombian judges and policemen who have paid with their lives 
for trying to uphold the law 
now there must be no safe haven for the narcoterrorists

nations to choose sides

drugs within their borders close banking loopholes such as 
offshore accounts and makes all drug criminals extraditable 
barco pledged to introduce the vienna convention to colombias 
congress for ratification upon his return to bogota

stopping the illegal trade in chemicals for processing cocaine and 
other drugs

down the traffickers moneylaundering system in banks 
investments real estate and legal businesses 
if the international banking system cooperates in cracking 
down we can put the cartel out of business he said

president bush on friday toured a region 
ravaged by hurricane hugo offering a little encouragement and 
a 11 billion relief check while defending federal efforts against 
charges of footdragging 
i do know that theres been a critic or two of the federal 
disasterrelief effort bush said after a brief look at the storm 
damage to the critics i simply say i understand we are trying 
very hard 
almost from the moment he landed the impact of hugo was evident 
bushs 15minute motorcade from charleston air force base inland 
to summerville took him past decimated trailer parks dozens of 
roofless buildings and pine forests filled with trees snapped in 
half 
in summerville the president was shown around the dorchester 
county courthouse grounds which were littered with smashed cars 
fallen trees and twisted metal he visited a community center where 
a school bus flattened by a fallen tree still stood in the 
driveway 
later he flew in a helicopter over the carolina coastline 
where hugo had come ashore a week earlier and flew low over some 
of the hardest hit areas of downtown charleston 
throughout bush offered words of encouragement to residents of 
a state where 270000 people were made jobless by the hurricane 
where more than 200000 people still have no electricity and where 
50000 are homeless 
in summerville he patted mayor berlin meyers on the shoulder 
asked himself a question and then answered it 
why am i here bush said im here to give a little 
encouragement to a courageous man 
touring a summerville street lined with destroyed and damaged 
houses bush talked to several residents and patting one on the 
shoulder said what spirit 
besides offering encouragement bush came to south carolina to 
respond to a week of rising criticism that the federal government 
has been too bureaucratic and too slow in helping victims of what 
mayor meyers called the worst storm that ever happened to our 
state 
the president was met as he landed by one of the most vocal 
critics charleston mayor joseph riley jr who said it was 
absolutely ridiculous that only two federal disaster relief 
offices had been opened in charleston and who has complained that 
when he asked for emergency power generators he was told the 
proper forms had to be filled out first 
riley said he told bush that our people are really hurting 
and that the president said he understood 
the mayor also told reporters 
i know his coming here helped us were glad hes here and i 
know by being here he will see and understand 
some area residents were skeptical 
hes about seven days late theres no use coming when 
everythings over said george witham 76 whose home on james 
island was demolished in the storm 
riley was not invited to join bush gov carroll campbell and 
several members of the states congressional delegation on the tour 
later as he ended his twohour visit to south carolina bush 
told reporters that the hurricane was tough it was devastating 
but the spirit of the people of south carolina came through 
loud and clear you couldnt help but be impressed to hear 
people say were going to bounce back 
as for the complaints about the federal emergency management 
agency which sen ernest hollings dsc had described as as 
sorry a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses as ive worked with in my 
life bush said 
when all the dust is settled and the debris is removed people 
are going to understand that this has been a total team effort 
earlier in front of the demolished school bus the president 
said im here trying to mobilize the resources of the federal 
government 
as part of that effort bush signed legislation shortly before 
arriving that makes 11 billion in emergency assistance available 
to hugos victims 
of that 400 million will go to puerto rico 300 million to 
the us virgin islands 200 million to south carolina and 50 
million to north carolina said congressional aides who asked to 
remain anonymous some 150 million will be held by fema for 
contingencies 
the sources said that the breakdown which does not appear in 
the legislation was worked out between congress and highranking 
fema officials 
bush said the money approved by congress just a day earlier is 
needed to help people rebuild their homes communities 
businesses and lives 
in addition to the 11 billion presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said that the commerce department was making 5 million 
available for the retraining of displaced workers and other 
programs and that the justice department had freed up 11 million 
to pay for stormrelated police overtime and repairs to police 
facilities damaged by hugo 
fitzwater said bush had also directed that fema with five 
disasterrelief offices in south carolina open four more in 
charleston and that the 200 employees taking requests for aid be 
increased by as many as it takes to process applications more 
quickly 
bush his spokesman said wants to make sure fema is 
committing all its resources effectively 
bush later issued a directive to all federal agency heads with 
employees in a stricken area telling them to give paid timeoff to 
any workers with a personal emergency because of the storm or 
who were needed for cleanup efforts 
the president made his own donation to the relief effort 
handing sen strom thurmond rsc a 1000 check from himself 
and his wife barbara for the red cross which has committed a 
record 42 million to helping victims of the hurricane 
noting the various private relief efforts underway across the 
nation bush told reporters about a chat he had had in summerville 
one thing that touched me very much was a young homeowner 
there saying that he had had offers of help from all over this 
country 
i think it does bring out the very best in the men and women 
of america who want to help in a tragedy of this nature

imelda marcos says she might keep the remains of 
ferdinand marcos at their hawaiian estate until the former 
philippine ruler can be buried in his homeland 
my plan has always been to bring him back mrs marcos said 
after her husbands death i have committed myself to what is 
ferdinands right to rest in peace in his motherland 
hawaiis attorney general said it might take a court ruling to 
say how long marcos body can remain at his honolulu home 
marcos 72 died thursday at st francis medical center after 
nearly nine months in the hospital doctors said kidney and lung 
failure and a widespread infection contributed to the cardiac 
arrest listed as the cause of death 
there were no immediate plans for burial she said and an aide 
suggested that barring their return to the philippines marcos 
remains might be above ground for a long time 
hawaii law requires that a body be embalmed buried or cremated 
within 30 hours of death unless it is in the hands of a coroner 
medical examiner or county physician 
morticians said marcoss embalmed body which has been displayed 
in a bronze casket in the living room of his makiki heights home 
since thursday could be preserved indefinitely 
there is nothing that would prohibit the temporary display of 
a body in a private home if it does not create a health hazard or a 
nuisance said state attorney general warren price 
it could take a court ruling to define temporary he said 
philippine president corazon aquino has forbidden her 
predecessors return even in death she softened her rhetoric 
however slightly thursday and said she may reconsider 
meanwhile a philippine official said friday that marcos death 
could encourage his family and former associates to settle claims 
made by the philippine government in an attempt to avoid costly 
legal battles 
we believe that there are cronies who were prevented from 
cooperating because of shame not to mention fear of the president 
to whom they owe so much said mateo caparas chairman of the 
presidential commission on good government in the philippines 
marcos attorney john bartko said the marcoses have always 
been and remain anxious to resolve the dispute especially since 
their resolution could allow his burial in the philippines and 
their marcos familys eventual return 
bartko said there had been no attempts at plea bargaining in 
mrs marcos us criminal case and said marcos death probably 
would have no effect on the case since marcos was separated from 
the proceedings due to his ill health 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent in a new york court to federal 
racketeering charges alleging she and her husband stole nearly 200 
million from their impoverished country and stashed it in the 
united states 
mrs marcos continued to receive mourners at the hillside home 
friday she allowed a reporter to view her husbands body and could 
be seen smoothing his hair and crying 
several promarcos filipino congressmen including rep roque 
ablan and rep ali dimoporo left manila on friday for hawaii to 
pay respects to marcos

representatives of private aid groups from 65 
countries charged friday that the world bank and the international 
monetary fund are eroding selfreliance selfdetermination and 
national sovereignty in the third world 
jim middaugh of the development group for alternative policies 
a private advocacy organization in washington said 200 people took 
part in the groups weeklong meeting held at the same time as the 
annual meeting of the bank and fund 
the bank and fund are owned by 152 governments with the united 
states holding the largest voting power 
the private groups statement cited the world banks estimate 
that debtor countries are transferring 50 billion to creditor 
countries this year largely in interest and principal repayments 
on debt largely because of payments on debt 
with the world bank along with the imf cast in the role of 
debt manager the debt crisis now defines development as economic 
growth geared not to the needs of people or to safeguarding of the 
environment but to debt repayment the statement said 
it added that the only way to avert a global crisis is to shift 
priorities away from getting third world countries to make quick 
profits so they can keep up with their debts 
citizens organizations participating in this weeks forum 
demonstrated that these policies have brought the further erosion 
of national selfreliance selfdetermination and sovereignty it 
added 
it complained that the world bank is not giving enough 
information to private organizations on how the banks projects 
affect the environment 
as the bank and imf are public institutions the 
nongovernmental organizations community also called for 
lifting the veil of secrecy that surrounds bank and imf 
operations it said 
bill brannigan a spokesman for the bank said it was up to 
countries where the bank has projects to divulge the banks views 
on their environmental effects that the bank itself has to keep 
them confidential

the man chosen by the new noncommunist 
government to lead the attack on polands crushing economic 
problems told parliament on friday that western aid depends on 
beginning difficult steps here 
deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz sketched a general 
outline of the governments economic plan in his appearance before 
the sejm or lower house of parliament he said details would be 
revealed soon 
the sejm was debating a budget bill that allows the goverment to 
take on an additional 103 billion of deficit spending until the 
end of the year for a total budget deficit of nearly 34 billion 
parliament members voting 2929 with 55 abstentions authorized 
the increase as a stopgap measure to keep state enterprises 
running although it means treating the illness with poison 
deputy eugeniusz brzozinski said 
the deficit is considered one main cause behind the countrys 
inflation financing a flood of wage increases that in turn tend to 
push up prices 
balcerowicz returned on thursday from washington where he 
attended a meeting of the international monetary fund and briefed 
western lenders on polands plans and credit needs 
balcerowicz was nominated by noncommunist prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki and installed in his post only 17 days ago he 
is in charge of tackling an economic crisis in which inflation is 
growing at a rate of 50 percent a month industrial production is 
falling and store shelves empty 
he wants a quick and radical overhaul of the economy to include 
privatizing state enterprises making the national currency the 
zloty convertible ending state subsidies to producers and 
breaking up big state monopolies 
changes would be coordinated with the imf and western lenders 
poland wants its 39 billion western debt rescheduled to help 
warsaw make the transition from a communist statedominated 
economy to a westernstyle market economy 
the painful steps balcerowicz discussed already have raised 
objections in his own solidarity camp some solidarity lawmakers 
complained bitterly at a meeting thursday that the government is 
allowing too many price increases 
solidarity leader lech walesa himself in remarks to reporters 
thursday warned that toorapid increases in prices would risk a 
civil war 
foreign aid will come only when we show readiness to take 
up difficult steps and make a great effort balcerowicz said in 
his speech 
he said the prime item on the agenda is economic stability 
meaning fighting inflation and market shortages 
he said the government will change the formula for automatic 
costofliving adjustments to make it less inflationary and 
introduce measures to check excessive wage growth reduce state 
subsidies to producers especially costly subsidies to the coal 
monopoly and force enterprises to promptly pay their obligations 
to the government and to other enterprises 
also this year the government will introduce antimonopoly 
rules and create some form of antimonopoly agency introduce new 
regulations to force insolvent enterprises into bankruptcy and 
create a market to facilitate selling shares of state enterprises 
the official reported 
balcerowicz noted the changes would cause some enterprises to 
shut down or go bankrupt and said the state must prepare social 
safeguards suitable to a market economy the government earlier 
discussed unemployment benefits and food stamps for the needy 
balcerowicz stressed in a separate interview with the state pap 
news agency that poland must take forceful steps in order to 
receive help from the west 
any moves undermining our credibility automatically reduce 
the size and chances of any aid from other countries he said 
representatives of the imf are expected here next month to 
conclude an agreement on a adjustment program in which poland 
would commit itself to economic reform that would entitle poland 
to an imf standby loan the green light to other lenders to 
reschedule polands debts and extend new credits

mayoral candidate rudolph giuliani has ignited 
the flashpowder of city politics flaring racial and religious 
tension as he struggles to wrest jewish voters from his black 
democratic opponent 
while giulianis firsttime candidacy has been dogged by 
missteps the latest controversy is heightened by his unabashed 
intent to win jewish votes by linking his opponent david dinkins 
with jesse jackson 
it is a naked effort to play on jewish fears rabbi balfour 
brickner a liberal jewish leader said friday the net effect of 
what hes doing is to increase racial polarization its a 
contemptible low blow 
at issue is an advertisement placed by giuliani in this weeks 
edition of the citys largestcirculation yiddish newspaper the 
algemeiner journal it shows two photos in one giuliani a 
republican with president bush in the other dinkins the 
manhattan borough president with jackson 
the text says let the people of new york choose their own 
destiny 
the ad intensified a rift in the citys jewish community which 
made up the largest proportion of white voters for dinkins in the 
sept 12 primary when he unseated threeterm incumbent mayor 
edward i koch 
on one side are critics such as brickner who said the ad plays 
unfairly on jewish suspicions of jackson who supports palestinian 
selfdetermination and once called new york hymietown for 
which he later apologized 
giuliani suspects that jews hate jesse jackson and hes 
playing on that hatred and that fear said brickner dinkins he 
noted has a history of supporting israel soviet jewry and other 
jewish causes 
yet others such as eli blachman associate editor of the 
algemeiner journal called the ad fair play it shows who 
giulianis surrounded with and who dinkins is surrounded with he 
said theres no words of racism it just says the people have to 
decide 
jackson in puerto rico surveying damage from hurricane hugo 
said he didnt want to comment on the ad placed by giuliani but he 
praised dinkins mayoral campaign 
i dont want to violate the integrity of this mission to the 
caribbean discussing new york politics jackson said but 
dinkins is doing a very effective campaign appealing to the hopes 
and not the fears of the people 
according to polls 22 percent of new york citys 3 million 
registered voters are black and 18 percent are jewish of the 
total about 2 million are democrats 
the message came at a moment of heightened sensitivity racial 
tensions arose here in august after a white gang killed a black 
youth in bensonhurst brooklyn a killing reminiscent of a 1986 
racial attack in howard beach queens 
then jewish comedian jackie mason a giuliani supporter 
suggested in an interview published this week that jews were 
supporting dinkins as a result of jewish complexes and said 
blacks had rarely backed jewish causes 
the jewish community relations council demanded repudiation of 
those remarks saying the election should not be dragged into the 
gutter and the giuliani campaign dropped mason the comedian 
apologized on thursday 
the council an umbrella group of jewish organizations did not 
directly criticize the giuliani advertisement among jews some 
consider it to be legitimate and some consider it to be 
illegitimate said michael miller the councils director it 
raises a lot of emotions 
properly or not miller said giuliani has raised a doubleedged 
sword risking alienating some jews while he attracts those who 
fear jacksons role in a dinkins mayoralty the jewish community 
is not a monolith he said 
some analysts said the ad marked a necessary if risky step for 
giuliani who trails dinkins by more than 20 percentage points in 
the polls and must overcome a 51 democratic edge in voter 
enrollment to win on nov 7 
giuliani doesnt have the jewish vote and he wants it said 
brickner he thinks he needs it to win and hes right hes 
reaching out to the jewish vote grasping at it with every gimmick 
and tool he can use 
giulianis strategists defended the approach 
this ad has absolutely nothing to do with race it has to do 
with who are the political supporters of the candidates said ken 
caruso giulianis deputy campaign manager 
its a very fair question to ask what jesse jacksons role 
will be in a david dinkins administration caruso said its 
the dinkins campaign that brought jesse jackson here 
dinkins was state cochairman of jacksons 1988 presidential 
campaign jackson campaigned in black neighborhoods for dinkins 
albeit sparingly late in the primary race and he spoke at 
dinkins primarynight celebration 
friday dinkins called jackson my friend reiterated his 
support for israel and said of giulianis ad i know what hes 
trying to do id prefer that people would say and do things 
designed to bring people together rather than divide them 
yet blachman the newspaper editor said divisions already exist 
out the street i hear constantly that people are worried about 
the jesse jackson business he said they think dinkins is a 
very nice fellow if jesse jackson wasnt around him he wouldnt 
have a problem with the jewish people

the government in a reversal 
of its integration policies will take responsibility for some 
multiracial schools through funding or running them directly a 
cabinet official said friday 
piet clase minister of white education announced the new 
policy after a meeting thursday with a delegation of people trying 
to prevent the closing of johannesburg girls high school 
enrollment has declined at the whitesonly school and a committee 
of parents teachers and students has campaigned to save the 
facility by opening it to all races 
mike ellis education spokesman for the antiapartheid 
democratic party said clases statement represented a dramatic 
shift in policy 
the proapartheid conservative party the largest opposition 
party in parliament denounced the decision 
this is a scandalous break from all previous promises made by 
the minister of education and training with regard to this 
matter it said 
we wish to send an urgent warning to the white population that 
this latest step on the part of the government is the beginning of 
full integration at school level the statement added 
most public schools would remain segregated under the new 
approach but it would benefit families in certain urban 
neighborhoods that are in the process of being declared 
multiracial most of these areas have been integrated for years 
despite laws mandating residential segregation 
clase said friday the government has a responsibility to provide 
education in free settlement areas the official term for 
neighborhoods that will be designated multiracial 
he said the committee seeking to save johannesburg girls high 
school had two options it could transform the school into a 100 
percent statesubsidized private school or apply to have the 
schools neighborhood become a free settlement area 
at present black mixedrace and indian children living in 
multiracial areas must either attend private schools or travel to 
segregated public schools in outlying townships

angered by criticism of its crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators china told western nations friday they 
were interfering in chinas internal affairs and stop it or risk 
harming relations 
foreign minister qian qichen declared in the first chinese 
address to the general assembly since the violence in june china 
has never feared and will in no way bend to any foreign pressure 
qian delivered a long rebuke to certain western countries not 
named and a discourse on peaceful coexistence 
chinas relations with western countries were on a course of 
steady development he said however difficulties of varying 
degrees have emerged over the past few months in our relations with 
certain western countries 
qian acknowleged that the crackdown on protesters is known to 
all 
it began when hundreds of people were killed as the military 
swept across beijing on june 34 
speaking of the weeks of turmoil qian said it goes without 
saying that how to deal with this problem is chinas internal 
affair 
he said most governments understand chinas actions only 
certain western governments ignoring the facts and basing 
themselves on nothing but distorted news reports and 
misinformation leveled unwarranted charges against the chinese 
government and applied pressure on it 
he said china respects the sovereignty of other countries and if 
western nations wish to repair relations with beijing they should 
do the same 
herein lies the way out of the current difficulties he said 
even so qian affirmed that china will adhere to its policy of 
reform and opening to the outside world 
the united states britain and other western countries have 
reproached china for suppressing the protests which china calls an 
antigovernment rebellion the united states barred transfer of 
some military items to underscore its protests 
in the past week qian said some nations in the united nations 
continued to attack the chinese government groundlessly 
in speeches to the general assembly this week britain and japan 
criticized china the united states said nothing of the issue 
also friday amnesty international said it appealed to china to 
release all political prisoners 
the londonbased human rights organization said in a message to 
prime minister li peng the release of prisoners would be a major 
contribution to the protection of human rights 
amnesty said its message specifically mentioned wei jingsheng 
xu wenli and wang xizhe who edited unofficial journals during the 
chinese democracy movement in 1978 and 1979

president hosni mubarak of egypt called on 
israel friday to trade territory for peace and talk to the 
palestine liberation organization saying a historic opportunity 
for peace is at hand 
conditions are now favorable for launching 
palestinianisraeli dialogue without preconditions he told the 
un general assembly 
the dialogue he said aims at bridging the existing gap in 
positions exploring the way to eliminate the conflict once and for 
all on the basis of applying the principle of territory for peace 
he called the plo the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people he said the organization had adopted positive 
attitudes toward a peace settlement and deserves all welcome and 
support from the international community 
israel officially refuses to talk to the plo which it views as 
a terrorist group the plo says it now accepts israel and wants 
peace and a separate state 
israels rightwing likud bloc headed by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir also rejects the concept of trading land for peace its 
rival in the coalition government the centerleft labor party 
favors territorial concessions 
in a bid to keep likud from torpedoing peace talks us 
secretary of state james a baker iii said friday that egypts 
10point peace plan is negotiable 
the real question is what position the government of israel 
takes when the cabinet meets next week said baker at a news 
conference at the us mission to the united nations 
the egyptian 10 points is not a competing proposal it is 
simply a method of trying to get implementation of the shamir 
proposal baker added 
in may shamir proposed elections among palestinians to choose 
representatives to negotiate with israel for limited 
selfgovernment in the israelioccupied territories 
the name of the game right now it seems to me is to for 
the first time get israelis and palestinians talking to each 
other baker said 
mubarak offered to host preliminary israelipalestinian talks in 
cairo to pave the way for shamirs election plan 
egypt is the only middle east country to have made peace with 
israel for which it was effectively excommunicated from the arab 
world only recently has egypt been welcomed back to the arab fold 
and it now seeks to act as a mediator in the troubled region 
letting the existing opportunity slip by will be a grievous 
mistake exceeding all errors made in the past which led to loss of 
historic opportunities to contain the conflict and avoid its 
aggression mubarak said 
mubaraks 10point election proposal seeks to complement 
shamirs own plan and win wider acceptance among palestinians 
israel television and radio late thursday reported foreign 
minister moshe arens also of likud met with mubarak in new york 
during the meeting mubarak made a rare phone call to shamir to wish 
him a happy jewish new year and told shamir he didnt want to see 
the government divided over his peace plan the reports said 
finance minister shimon peres who heads labor and also was in 
new york meeting with us egyptian and other leaders returned to 
israel late thursday 
mubarak also advocated an international middle east peace 
conference israel rejects any conference that would impose a 
settlement on it and calls for bilateral negotiations with its 
neighbors 
in another development the plo said friday it accepted an offer 
by the soviet union to host a meeting between it and israel 
mahmoud abbas a member of the plo executive committee 
announced the acceptance in a statement published by the official 
palestininan news agency wafa the statement was released in tunis 
tunisia 
the soviet offer was made in new york on thursday by soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who said moscow would be 
willing to act as an intermediary between the two sides 
abbas also known as abu mazen said the soviet proposal was 
an important step to advance the peace process in favor of a 
political solution to the arabisraeli conflict and the solution to 
the palestinian problem

mayor joseph p riley jr said he was 
disappointed president bushs visit friday didnt include more of 
the citys destruction from hurricane hugo 
about 100000 people in the city remained without power and 
offers of food and supplies continued to pour in while the 
president toured devastated outlying areas and flew over charleston 
in a helicopter 
riley said the symbolism of the president coming to one of 
the oldest cities in america which has suffered its greatest 
natural disaster in 100 years would have been very good 
bush flew into charleston air force base north of the city 
traveled by car to summerville flew over charleston in a 
helicopter and returned to the base 
i had hoped very much that he would come to charleston and 
that he would have been able to come sooner riley said 
the president spent two hours in south carolina after approving 
11 billion in federal aid for hugos victims in the state and 
elsewhere riley praised bushs quick action on the money 
the storm smashed into charleston on sept 21 packing 135 mph 
winds and claiming 62 lives in the united states and the caribbean 
including 18 people in south carolina 
in addition to those people still without power in charleston 
about 100000 power customers were doing without in other parts of 
the state 
south carolina electric amp gas co said 2000 workers from 33 
power companies in nine states were helping to restore power 
authorities continued using dogs to check the rubble of 
collapsed houses in the fishing village of mcclellanville where 
the storm hit hard 
a curfew remained in effect in charleston enforced by national 
guardsmen but it was scaled back two hours and is now in effect 
from 8 pm to 6 am

the policysetting body of the 
international atomic energy agency passed a resolution friday 
denouncing israels nuclear policies as a threat to peace and 
security 
it also voted to continue the observer status of the palestine 
liberation organization but with a name change and again 
postponed a decision on whether to suspend south africas 
membership in the agency 
a resolution sponsored by 14 states including iraq libya and 
saudi arabia was adopted on the last day of the annual general 
conference of the iaea the vote was 47 in favor 28 against with 
12 abstentions 
it was opposed by the united states and other western members 
james d watkins head of the us delegation said the resolution 
went beyond the mandate and competence of the iaea 
the resolution said its sponsors were gravely concerned about 
israels growing nuclear capability and threat to peace and 
security in the area it called on the jewish state to submit all 
of its nuclear installations to the iaea for inspection 
the issue has been raised repeatedly at general conference 
meetings and in a speech wednesday israeli chief delegate sy 
ettinger said the 113member agency wasted time with irrelevant 
political issues 
it is widely believed israel has the capability of producing 
atomic weapons but there is disagreement on whether it has any 
israel did not sign the 1969 nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
under which signatories submit their nuclear programs to iaea 
controls 
israel has expressed support of the principle of 
nonproliferation but has made its acceptance conditional on the 
establishment of the middle east as a zone free of nuclear weapons 
for the third year the general conference by a vote of 5926 
postponed a decision on whether to suspend south africa a 
resolution submitted by a group of african states criticized south 
africa for its persistent refusal to comply with u n 
resolutions 
south africa in a message last week to iaea director general 
hans blix said it would hold exploratory talks in december with 
us soviet and british diplomats on the possibility of signing 
the nonproliferation treaty 
the palestine liberation organization which has had observer 
status since 1975 will continue to have that status but the 
obervers will be referred to as palestine observers instead of plo 
observers that name change was an arabsponsored proposal approved 
by consensus

thousands of gallons of heating oil when it ran aground in june was 
fined 500000 and the captain ordered to pay 35500 in fines 
friday 
ballard shipping co and the captain iakovos e georgudis 
pleaded guilty aug 16 to one federal misdemeanor count each of 
violating clean water laws when nearly 300000 gallons of oil 
spilled off newport 
later friday in superior court georgudis pleaded no contest to 
a state charge of causing pollution a state charge against him of 
failing to have a harbor pilot on board the tanker was dropped as 
part of a plea bargain 
the 560foot tanker ran aground june 23 on brenton reef at the 
mouth of narragansett bay opening several gashes on its sides that 
were up to 250 feet long with some wide enough for divers to swim 
through 
ballards fine was levied in federal court where us district 
judge ernest torres ordered georgudis to pay 10000 the captains 
fines in state court totaled 25000 
in addition ballards insurance company united kingdom mutual 
steam ship assurance association bermuda ltd in london 
guaranteed 32 million to compensate for environmental damage 
agreed to reimburse the state 1 million and the federal government 
35 million for cleanup and agreed to make 500000 available for 
claims by individuals

chase the captain and the company back to greece to satisfy our 
claim 
the 560foot tanker had sailed from greece but is registered in 
liberia 
ballard promised under the plea agreement to pay the state for 
environmental research and park acquisiton us district judge 
ernest torres put ballard on one month of unsupervised probation to 
ensure payment of the fine 
torres said he would not jail georgudis because the captain 
cooperated with investigators saying his actions were negligent 
as opposed to willful or reckless 
georgudis 43 left court without comment 
the captain could have received 13 months in prison on the state 
charges the federal charge against ballard and the captain carried 
a possible year in jail

zsa zsa gabor was convicted of 
battery for slapping a police officer and two other misdemeanor 
charges friday prompting the fiery actress to remark i think 
russia cant be worse than this 
but miss gabor was acquitted of disobeying the officer when she 
drove away during a traffic stop confrontation she said she 
interpreted an obscene phrase he allegedly used as an order to 
leave 
in addition to the battery charge the hungarianborn actress 
was found guilty of driving without a valid drivers license and 
having an open bottle of alcohol in her rollsroyce 
miss gabor convicted of the most serious of the charges faces 
a possible 18 months and five days in jail and a maximum fine of 
3500 defense attorney william graysen said sentencing was set 
for oct 17 
i am very disappointed miss gabor told reporters outside 
court 
i cant believe in a country as great as ours that a 6foot4 
policeman can beat up a lady of 5foot4 and use dirty language 
like you were a streetwalker i think russia cant be worse 
than this or communist hungary either i think its ridiculous 
prosecutor elden fox said he would not ask for jail time for 
miss gabor but that he would seek compensation for the trials 
cost 
i want the 30000 restitution to the court for this media 
circus fox said the amount is the estimated cost of the trial 
miss gabor contended she was convicted because of her celebrity 
status 
i know its zsa zsa gabor the diamonds she loves to talk 
up shes not a milquetoast she said 
but jury foreman john burke a hollywood accountant disagreed 
thats not the person we really tried we tried a person who 
had a conflict with the police he said 
the 12member jury deliberated 90 minutes on wednesday all day 
thursday and returned their verdicts friday afternoon 
juror kevin goodman an attorney said there were plenty of 
arguments during the 12 hours of deliberation 
we werent in a dealstriking mood there was no compromise 
goodman said we came to the conclusion there was reasonable 
force used even if she was pulled from the car 
during the 15day trial miss gabor was fined 500 by municipal 
court judge charles rubin for violating what she called a gagging 
order by commenting to reporters on witnesses in the case 
another gag order violation allegation was dismissed by rubin 
officer paul kramer a motorcycle officer pulled miss gabors 
rollsroyce over june 14 after noticing expired registration tags 
on the auto as he checked for other violations she drove off 
miss gabor slapped kramer when he pulled her over a second time 
he said the attack was unprovoked but she said she reacted in 
selfdefense when he forcibly removed her from her car 
beverly hills police chief marvin iannone said the verdict 
vindicated kramer who has been berated for the last three months 
simply because he was doing his job 
the veteran celebritys trial was distinguished by colorful 
expletives and theatrics normally associated with the makebelieve 
jurisprudence of televisions divorce court and perry mason 
the carnival atmosphere culminated friday in a lateafternoon 
bomb threat that forced county marshals to briefly empty the 
courthouse no bomb was found 
later a county sheriffs bus filled with inmates drove away 
from the courthouse with its occupants chanting zsa zsa zsa 
zsa 
chattering from topics like jailhouse lesbians to comparisons of 
us justice and nazi germany miss gabor attracted as much media 
attention during her case as she did in any previous tv or film 
performance 
i am the daughter of a freedom fighter the star of such 
films as queen of outer space and boys night out told 
reporters during her trial i am a horsewomani am a princess 
i am zsa zsa 
upset by testimony that depicted her in a different light as a 
selfimportant foulmouthed shrew miss gabor stormed out of the 
courtroom in tears on four occasions i want to go to europe 
she said after one such walkout 
she is evasive about her age but court documents put it at 66 
miss gabors defense hinged on the contention that kramer was a 
tempermental brute who had a history of manhandling suspects 
i was screaming help help help she said in tearfilled 
testimony i was afraid of the police they were going to shoot 
me 
the trial lasting much longer than first anticipated cost 
taxpayers an estimated 30000

from the table where the men were sitting and was not in the room

the shot not knowing who was injured 
watley said he never returned to the room but walked into the 
back yard where he remained i never saw the body or the gun 
the news reported he said 
on friday however he told the radio station i never told 
anybody i wasnt in the room

president carlos menem is 
bringing home the remains of a controversial 19th century ruler to 
persuade his people to forgive military abuses of a decade ago 
the body of gen juan manuel de rosas is to arrive saturday 
aboard a plane from paris where it was sent after exhumation from 
a grave in southampton england on sept 21 
rosas ruled over a confederation of newly independent and 
rebellious provinces from 1835 until his ouster in 1852 he died in 
exile in england 
menem is expected to use the return of the strongmans remains 
as a backdrop to announce he will pardon some or all of the 18 
generals and admirals facing trial on charges they abused human 
rights in a brutal campaign against leftist subversives during the 
197683 military regime 
menem who took office on july 8 has repeatedly said pardons 
are needed to repair the decadeold rift the abuses caused between 
the military and civilians 
human rights groups including relatives of nearly 9000 people 
who disappeared during the military campaign fiercely oppose any 
pardons leftist political parties and even a small faction of 
menems peronist party also are against the move 
an estimated 50000 opponents marched in downtown buenos aires 
on sept 8 and called for trial and punishment of the accused 
officers 
they can hold a million marches but the decision has already 
been made menem said recently ive been talking about 
pacifying the country since before my election on may 14 
some human rights and political groups vowed to obtain a million 
signatures by sunday on petitions objecting to any plan to pardon 
military officers accused or convicted of human rights violations 
organizers said friday they would set up booths on streets and in 
plazas throughout the country to collect signatures 
far from pacifying the country any kind of pardon would 
endanger democracy said communist party secretarygeneral 
patricio etchegaray 
in repatriating the body of rosas hailed as a hero by 
nationalists and condemned as a bloodthirsty tyrant by liberals 
menem chose a case that illustrates how political animosities can 
endure in argentina 
at other times in our national life the repatriation of the 
remains of this national hero would have generated a storm of 
criticism said buenos aires provincial gov antonio cafiero 
now were leaving behind a past that divided us 
plans call for a round of ceremonies after which rosas will be 
reburied in a family crypt in buenos aires la recoleta cemetery 
also the final resting place of dozens of his enemies 
when rosas died in exile in 1877 his enemies swore not even 
the dust of his bones would ever be allowed to return to 
argentina 
the idea of repatriating his remains was first brought up by 
menem and the plan has provoked little public opposition aside 
from a few newspaper columns and several letters to editors 
governmentsponsored television ads have appeared in recent days

federal drug agents seized 20 tons of cocaine 
with a street value of up to 20 billion friday at a warehouse in a 
quiet section of the city and officials called it the biggest drug 
haul in history 
three men were arrested and about 10 million in cash was seized 
at the warehouse on an upscale treelined street in a mostly 
residential community of sylmar near the san gabriel mountain 
foothills said john m zienter the drug enforcement 
administrations agent in charge for los angeles 
ive been on this job for 25 years and ive never seen so 
much dope in one place zienter said in an interview i 
couldnt believe it 
the three mexican men who were not immediately identified were 
expected to be arraigned monday on charges of possessing and 
distributing cocaine in addition to the drugs and cash agents 
seized financial records customer lists and a large trucktrailer 
that was parked at the warehouses entrance no weapons were found 
the seized records offered a list of leads that was endless 
said ira reiner los angeles county district attorney during a 
news conference friday 
zienter placed the street value of the drug at 20 billion 
earlier dea spokesman ralph lochridge valued the haul at 
onetenth that amount based on a price of 100 a gram for pure 
cocaine which he called a very conservative estimate but 
lochridge later said that when the cocaine was prepared for 
smoking it could bring in far more 
if its rocked up in the form of crack it could go as high as 
10 times above that up to 20 billion lochridge said by 
telephone explaining that the figure was based on diluting the 
cocaine to the maximum amount possible and converting it to rock 
form to be sold individually on the street 
using los angeles police techniques to calculate the value of 
diluted cocaine on the street 170250 per pound the value of 
the drug would be nearly 7 billion 
this seizure should put to rest any further speculation that 
los angeles is in fact the major pathway for cocaine entering the 
country and has in fact become a major distribution center in the 
united states lochridge said 
however dea officials in washington cautioned against drawing 
conclusions that the bulk of cocaine entry into the country had 
shifted to los angeles 
we are not in a position to say that there is a major shift in 
trends in cocaine coming into the country said dea spokesman 
frank shults 
through the third quarter of fiscal 1989 ending june 30 a total 
of 184 tons of cocaine had been seized in miami compared with 22 
tons in los angeles he said in fiscal 1988 miami seized 317 
tons of cocaine compared with 206 tons in los angeles 
we cant make conclusions about overall trends and patterns 
based on one seizure despite the magnitude of that particular 
seizure shults said 
fridays haul easily topped the previous us record of more 
than 8700 pounds recorded in fort lauderdale fla in 1987 and 
surpassed the world record a 12ton seizure in colombia said dea 
agent phil hartman 
the huge stash arranged in orderly rows up to 10 feet high 
along the warehouses walls was linked to the medellin and cali 
drug cartels of colombia reiner said 
these arent just drug runners reiner said these are the 
major drug dealers they dont get any bigger than this until you 
get to colombia 
the dea and the us attorneys office here believe that more 
than half the cocaine distributed in the country now floods in 
through los angeles colombian drug groups bring it across the 
border from mexico and los angeles street gangs distribute it in 
more than 40 us cities they have said 
cash seizures from the drug trade totaled more than 100 million 
last year in los angeles topping miami for the first time the 
citys federal reserve surplus one way of measuring illegal money 
laundering has jumped by more than 2000 percent in five years 
to 38 billion last year 
the cocaine trafficking is in a state of constant flux and 
miami los angeles and houston continue to be very heavy cocaine 
areas shults said from washington 
cocaine today is coming into the country all along the east 
coast the gulf coast and the west coast shults said thats a 
trend that has been continuing since the early 80s 
lochridge said evidence from fridays seizure would tie into 
another a yearlong investigation by the dea los angeles police and 
several other police departments 
officials said fridays seizure came after they received a tip 
this week and witnessed a sale of 20 kilos of cocaine they then 
got a search warrant for the warehouse 
authorities moved in about midnight on the building in the north 
san fernando valley about 25 miles from downtown across the 
street from the carefully landscaped warehouse are offices for the 
cocacola bottling co other neighbors include a manufacturer of 
pacemakers and a hydraulic pump supplier 
the warehouse which did not appear to have any unusual security 
systems is two miles from interstate 5 the main northsouth 
thoroughfare for california 
lochridge said the dea had been investigating and conducting 
intense surveillance for a year before moving in on the 
warehouse 
california attorney general john van de kamp has joined a chorus 
of state and local officials complaining the federal government 
should do more to stop drug trafficking here

the government on friday announced a postponement 
of its plan to return englands electricity industry to private 
ownership and cited the complexity of the sale 
energy secretary john wakeham issued a statement saying the 
government remains on target to complete the privatization of the 
industry within this parliament 
but it also said that maintaining the previous timetable would 
require additional transitional arrangements which would have 
introduced added complexity to the task and made it more difficult 
for us to meet our objective 
general parliamentary elections must be called before mid1992 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative party government 
plans to divide into two companies the central electricity 
generating board which now has a monopoly to supply electricity to 
england and wales 
twelve existing regional boards are to be turned over to private 
companies that will buy electricity and sell it to consumers in 
their region 
under the new plan the regional boards are expected to be sold 
in the fall of 1990 instead of spring or summer 1990 the 
generating companies would be sold in the first half of 1991 
instead of fall 1990 to spring 1991 
the privatization expected to raise anywhere from 24 billion 
to 44 billion faces strong opposition from the labor party and 
other groups that believe the utilities should remain in state 
hands 
the government claiming nationalization of industries stifled 
the economy and seeking to promote capitalism has sold many state 
companies to private firms for billions of dollars over the past 
decade

el salvadors leftist guerrillas said friday 
they will not accept even an unconditional ceasefire offer from 
the government because there would be no guarantee of safety or 
democracy 
guerrilla representatives said they expected salvadoran 
president alfredo cristiani to offer an immediate unconditional 
unilateral ceasefire when he speaks to to the un general 
assembly monday and they were rejecting the offer in advance 
if there are no guarantees a ceasefire is a fiction said 
salvador samayoa a member of the farabundo marti national 
liberation fronts politicaldiplomatic commission in an interview 
with the associated press 
they will keep imprisoning our activists there will still be 
violence he said its all a kind of show 
he and miguel saenz another member of the commission accused 
cristianis rightist government of widespread human rights 
violations since it took office on june 1 they claimed the 
government is arresting and beating many leftist activists and then 
releasing them without charges 
the government has denied such allegations 
samayoa and saenz said the guerrillas launched an offensive 
tuesday to protest human rights violations assert the rebels 
presence and pin down government troops guerrilla attacks have 
been reported in 10 of el salvadors 14 provinces 
but the fmln officials said they still were optimistic about 
chances for progress at a meeting between rebel and government 
representatives set for oct 1617 in san jose costa rica 
samayoa said the momentum for peace in the region reflected by 
the agreement to disband nicaraguan rebels in exchange for 
democratic elections in their country and internal pressure in el 
salvador will push the government to a reasonable position 
el salvadors 10yearold war has taken more than 70000 lives 
and ravaged the economy in the nation of 5 million despite a total 
of 38 billion in us economic and military aid 
samayoa said a ceasefire would have to be part of an overall 
agreement for peace and democracy in el salvador and the rebels 
made specific proposals to that end at a meeting with the 
government in mexico city earlier this month 
we want to negotiate the conditions that will allow us to vie 
for power on the political path said saenz thats the key 
point 
he said the guerrillas are no longer asking for a powersharing 
arrangement before a settlement is reached 
in a peace proposal made in mexico city the rebels demanded 
judicial reforms an end to repression maintenance of land and 
economic reforms made since 1980 and changes in the military 
they also asked for constitutional reforms and clearly defined 
ceasefire lines

the supreme court begins its new term much 
where it left off last summer with the issue of abortion heading 
the list of closely watched cases 
after a threemonth recess the justices return to the bench 
today to begin deliberations in a variety of controversial legal 
and political disputes none is likely to be more divisive or a 
better bellwether of the courts conservative course than abortion 
the court will hear arguments in three abortion cases probably 
in december or january that will determine whether it will expand 
the new regulatory power it gave states last july 
harvard university law professor laurence tribe said the july 
ruling began in a very major way the dismantling of roe vs 
wade the courts 1973 ruling that established a right to 
abortion 
the court may never say roe vs wade is overruled but is 
likely to say roe vs wade never heard of it tribe said 
officials from minnesota and ohio are urging the justices to 
allow laws requiring young unmarried girls to get parental consent 
before having abortions in the third case illinois is seeking 
stricter control over clinics that perform the great majority of 
abortions 
the state officials are not asking the court to overturn roe vs 
wade which legalized abortions nationwide 
the bush administration which urged the court last term to 
reverse the 1973 ruling is taking a lower profile this time 
the justice department will not participate in oral arguments in 
any of the three cases although it is expected to submit a legal 
brief supporting minnesotas parental consent law 
the abortion debate in america was recast dramatically by the 
courts july 3 ruling in a missouri case cutting back abortion 
rights and letting states make abortions harder to obtain 
the court by a 54 vote said states may require doctors to 
administer tests for determining whether a fetus is capable of 
surviving outside the womb 
it also ruled that states may ban even privately paid abortions 
in public hospitals 
holding the balance of power in that case and perhaps for the 
future of abortion rights is sandra day oconnor the only female 
justice in the courts history 
in a separate concurring opinion in july she said the missouri 
regulations do not place an undue burden on a womans right to 
an abortion oconnor said she was not prepared to decide then 
whether the right established 16 years ago now should be discarded 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices anthony m 
kennedy and byron r white are ready to overturn roe vs wade 
justice antonin scalia voted to do so 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and john paul stevens reaffirmed their support of the 1973 
holding 
the july ruling has made abortion a hotter issue for the state 
legislatures where rejuvenated womens rights activists and 
antiabortion forces are taking the battle 
but the supreme court remains an important arena for the fight 
here is a look at the three abortion cases on the court docket 
this term 
the illinois case turnock vs ragsdale could be the most 
important the 7th us circuit court of appeals struck down 
regulations a trial judge said would force abortion clinics to 
become the functional equivalent of small hospitals 
the clinics where nearly all early abortions are performed 
would be required to provide elaborate medical equipment and 
services that the clinics say are unnecessary for patient safety 
the cost of an abortion could rise by nearly 50 
the case could have broad significance if the court decides to 
water down or scrap its trimester approach to abortion rights 
established by roe vs wade that ruling generally prohibits states 
from imposing health regulations that make abortions more expensive 
or difficult to obtain in the first three months of pregnancy 
in hodgson vs minnesota the court will review a system that 
requires both parents of an unmarried girl under 18 to receive 
notification from the doctor 48 hours before an abortion is 
performed alternatively the girl may bypass parental notification 
by convincing a judge she is mature enough to choose abortion for 
herself 
the system was in force for five years before a federal judge 
ruled it was unconstitutional but the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals reversed the judges ruling 
the second parental notification case ohio vs akron center 
for reproductive health raises similar issues an ohio law 
requires the physician to give notice in person or by telephone to 
one parent 24 hours prior to the abortion or by regular and 
certified mail 48 hours in advance 
alternatively a judge would have up to 22 days to decide 
whether to permit the minors abortion 
the ohio law passed in 1985 never took effect before it was 
struck down by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by the 6th 
us circuit court of appeals 
the supreme court has allowed states to regulate abortions for 
unmarried minors more strictly than for adult women 
the justices in a decision announced two months before kennedy 
joined the court split 44 in 1987 over the validity of such 
regulation by illinois

when lighthouse keeper 
dennis dever flicks on a switch 15 minutes before sunset 
illuminating boston light and the surrounding harbor he is 
following a tradition that began in 1716 
dever is the last in a succession of lightkeepers that began 
with george worthylake who drowned with his family when his boat 
overturned on the way back to the island in november 1718 benjamin 
franklin wrote a poem about the tragedy 
now its not tragedy but technology that threatens to force 
dever to leave his post on this rocky picturesque islet boston 
light one of the few remaining manned lighthouses in the country 
is scheduled to be the last one automated next year 
itll be the last page in a long chapter of american 
history said dever the 29yearold son of a onetime lighthouse 
keeper this country was built on lighthouses showing boats 
where to go its sad to think that after 273 years there wont be 
a keeper here 
only six other lighthouses in the country are still manned and 
they are scheduled to be automated within the next several months 
according to wayne wheeler of the san franciscobased us 
lighthouse society the lighthouses are located in egmont key 
fla coney island ny on block island in rhode island on goat 
island off the maine coast and on the kennebec river near bath 
maine where there are two 
sen edward m kennedy dmass has introduced legislation that 
would retain boston light as the last manned lighthouse and keep it 
from being automated 
dever a petty officer 1st class in the us coast guard who has 
supervised a crew of two at boston light for the past 18 months 
acknowledged i wasnt happy at first when i got here but then i 
learned to like it 
although hes at home with his wife of five years only one week 
each month because of his schedule dever said he has come to love 
life at the lighthouse 
the sunny whitewashed buildings by day give way to often eerie 
nights ghosts perhaps the souls of shipwreck victims or the 
mysterious lady in black are said to stalk the island 
dever and his crew dave sandrelli and al ux live in a 
comfortable twostory gabled house on one end of the island 
there is no sign of dust or clutter in the neat carpeted living 
room where bow windows overlook the pounding atlantic and the 
lights of downtown boston 11 miles away 
i feel an attachment to the old keepers said dever after 
arriving at the light he found the names of old keepers scratched 
in rocks all over the island dever has since etched his name on a 
a piece of granite outside the house 
dever named the islands black cat ida lewis after a 
lighthouse keeper in newport ri who made hundreds of rescues 
during her 32year tenure in the mid1800s 
the island dog 13 years old is named farrah a holdover from a 
coast guard crew who were fans of the old charlies angels tv 
series which starred farrah fawcett it is a boston light 
tradition according to dever and his crew to paint farrahs 
toenails pink 
the island is dominated by the 89foot lighthouse where 76 
wrought iron steps lead to the tower there two 1000watt bulbs 
positioned behind a fiveton fresnel lens consisting of 336 glass 
prisms are bent into thin pencil beams of light that flash every 10 
seconds the light is visible for 27 miles at night looking up 
from the bottom of the tower the beams of light radiate out into 
the sky like bicycle spokes 
depending on what day it is dever or one of his men rise early 
and turn the light off 15 minutes after sunrise when its cloudy 
or foggy of course the light is left on 
through the years all variety of human drama has been played 
out on the island 
there was romance in 1853 harbor pilot albert small proposed 
to the keepers daughter lucy long at the top of the tower she 
accepted 
shipwrecks were common one of the worst occurred in november 
1861 when the square rigger maritana broke up on rocks near the 
island in a snowstorm bodies from the wreck washed up on the 
island for months and at least one sailor is buried somewhere on 
the island 
there was skulduggery around 1845 the lighthouse keeper tobias 
cook made cheap cigars that sold as expensive spanish imports in 
boston until he was discovered 
there was even a birth georgia norwood born at the light in 
april 1932 was the inspiration for ruth carmens book storm 
child two years ago the norwood family held a reunion at the 
lighthouse

make a mistake when shopping for food or 
clothing and the loss usually isnt a big deal but thats not the 
case when seeking shelter 
a home is the biggest purchase of a lifetime for most families 
and since most folks dont buy houses all that often they have 
relatively little experience in dealing with the complicated legal 
procedures the often confusing terms and the many potential 
mistakes that can be made 
since being an unwary buyer can cost thousands of dollars over 
the years it is usually wise to invest a few dollars in advance 
becoming informed about the problems houses can have and about the 
pitfalls of buying 
to begin with make sure the house is sturdy theres nothing 
worse than investing a lifes savings in what seems to be a good 
home only to have it filled with repair headaches or worse 
professional inspection services operate in most larger cities 
and can check out a home for 100 or so providing a report on its 
condition and recommending needed repairs 
consumer experts recommend that buyers of older homes have an 
inspection before committing themselves to the deal and 
considering the periodic reports of flaws and problems in some new 
housing inspections might not be a bad idea even in that case 
a professional inspection is especially important if the house 
has a septic tank system 
but before hiring an inspector check out their credentials 
federal housing officials warn that some folks who have gone into 
the inspection business exaggerate flaws and then offer to make 
repairs at inflated costs 
things to have carefully checked in older homes include rundown 
equipment such as the furnace air conditioning and water heaters 
wet basements may also be a problem and the home should be checked 
for termites inadequate or outdated wiring faulty plumbing and 
the condition of the roof 
while youre thinking about all this of course people are 
tossing around words like amortization and easement swayle and 
casement gambrel roof and quitclaim deed its enough to boggle 
the mind 
a wise buyer will do a bit of homework beforehand and there are 
some lowcost booklets available from the government that can help 
prevent at least a few housing headaches 
wise home buying is a good one to start with only 24 pages 
this booklet from the department of housing and urban development 
packs in lots of advice and warnings reminders of problems to 
watch for and how to avoid many of them 
two other nearly essential booklets are simple lists of terms 
and what they mean keys to the complicated terminology of todays 
housing 
home buyers vocabulary lists terms dealing with deeds 
sales and legal considerations in the purchase of a house while 
homeowners glossary of building terms includes housing 
construction terms 
these and several other handy housingrelated booklets may be 
purchased from the consumer information center pueblo colo

the capital gains bill still has a long way to 
go before it becomes law but already you can feel some faint 
stirring of discontent about its limitations 
criticism of two aspects of the bill just passed by the house 
are bound to make their way into discussions in the senate 
first of them is the absence of any inflation adjustment for 
existing assetholders next is the twoyear limitation on the 
reduction 
almost forgotten in such discussions will be an awareness of the 
ostensible reason for the cut which is to provide the federal 
government with more revenue rather than to do favors for certain 
constituencies 
as passed by the house the capital gains tax bill would lower 
to 196 percent the highest tax bracket for capital gains which 
are the financial rewards of longterm investments equities 
stocks real estate and the like 
most people with capital gains now pay 28 percent to 33 percent 
those less well off also may have important capital gains 
political oratory notwithstanding their tax would drop to 105 
percent from 15 percent 
these percentages however would last just two years after 
which the tax would return to 28 percent and 15 percent 
thereafter capital investments would be indexed to wring out the 
false profit of inflation 
by this means it is hoped individuals will be encouraged to 
sell their investments now gathering dust at which time they will 
be compelled to pay capital gains taxes which are assessed only 
after the assets are sold 
it is generally believed that many people have been holding on 
to their assets because they cannot afford to sell and pay the tax 
not just the very rich either some ordinary folks have seen their 
money expand 10 times in 20 years 
no doubt some of these people will view the twoyear period as 
a rare opportunity and so will take the cash pay the tax and 
reinvest in something more in keeping with their current life 
style uncle sams revenues will rise 
however there is less certainty on another contention that 
investors will be encouraged by lower taxes to invest in new 
enterprises that will grow into firms employing lots of people and 
paying lots of taxes 
criticism on this score will come from a wide variety of 
smallbusiness people including venture capitalists who already 
are saying that two years is not enough capital investments are 
long term they say two years is not 
as they see it if this aspect of the law is to encourage 
entrepreneurial investments it must be extended by several more 
years or even indefinitely two years they say is not enough 
time to earn a respectable profit 
perhaps an even larger squawk could come from investors who feel 
that past inflation should be deducted from their capital gains 
they have a point because inflation might account for half their 
socalled profits or even more 
it is conceivable that even with the tax deduction some people 
could end up as losers such an unhappy situation could result for 
example if the rate of inflation approached equaled or exceeded 
the investment rate of return 
logic would seem to apply to the past as well as to the future 
if those with gains after 1992 are to be taxexempted from 
inflation why shouldnt earlier investors be treated in the same 
fashion 
you might think the answer is clear cut but it isnt logic is 
not the issue taxes are the whole idea is to raise revenues spur 
economic activity and try to finance the government not to 
provide justice 
the latter belongs to another entirely separate branch of 
government

some chant some meditate some 
dance some sit in the lotus position and hum 
every year hundreds of devotees of the occult trek to giza 
plateau near cairo to absorb mystical vibes said to be trapped 
inside the pyramids of the pharaohs cheops chephren and mycerinus 
pyramid power is said to cure a host of ills give glimpses into 
the future provide a better nights sleep even halt aging all 
for the price of admission three egyptian pounds 120 
until now 
under new rules pyramid groupies are going to have to pay more 
a lot more 
zahi hawass giza plateaus director general said groups of up 
to 15 now are allowed to meditate or seek extrasensory powers 
in the pyramids for 1000 egyptian pounds 400 and only outside 
normal tourist hours each extra participant pays 50 pounds 20 
hawass said seven to eight groups ask permission each month to 
conduct seances inside the pyramids most want either to spend the 
night inside or to enter at the first rays of dawn 
in the us and elsewhere you have a lot of people with 
problems and these people are seeking solutions they look to the 
supernatural and they think of the pyramids hawass said 
but we cant let these groups interfere with tourists wanting 
to look at the pyramids from a historical or architectural 
standpoint 
hawass said the most active pyramidvisiting mystical groups in 
the united states are several from santa barbara calif and from 
the edgar cayce foundation of virginia beach va named after the 
american psychic who died in 1945 cayce taught that the secrets of 
atlantis and knowledge of the future are buried under the right 
front paw of the sphinx at the foot of giza plateau 
in addition to americans theme cruises are organized in europe 
and growing numbers of japanese tours come to giza especially to 
tap pyramid power hawass said 
this pyramid power stuff is really big he said people 
want to believe in magic and big structures give an air of magic 
im sure if i called myself the pyramid prophet i could have a 
following larger than the most famous indian guru 
built about 4600 years ago the pyramids remain enigmas to 
scientists as well as to seekers of the unknown 
the first person to enter the great pyramid of cheops in 
postpharaonic times was the caliph of baghdad abdullah almamun 
in 820 ad he forced his way in by heating rocks then breaking 
them by pouring on vinegar 
as generations of scientists and tourists eccentrics and 
treasure hunters followed him pyramid mystique grew over the ages 
perhaps the most famous personality to enter in search of the 
occult was napoleon bonaparte who spent the night of aug 12 
1799 inside cheops pyramid and emerged ashen and shaken 
he went to his grave in 1821 without telling what he experienced 
no whats the use napoleon was said to have told a friend 
you wouldnt believe me anyway 
hawass said many people especially in the united states have 
ideas and theories about the giza pyramids particularly cheops 
great pyramid 
they read that cheops is made of 23 million blocks each one 
weighing 2 tons to 15 tons each side at an angle of 51 degrees 
50 minutes and 35 seconds he said 
they think nobody on earth could have built this that the 
pyramids were built by people from outer space or survivors from 
the lost continent of atlantis 
they never look at whats attached to the pyramids the 
structures the organization necessary to build them the cult of 
the king 
he said more than 200 books about pyramid power have been 
published in the united states but fewer than half a dozen 
contain any science of value 
hawass who has a doctorate in egyptology from the university of 
pennsylvania and has lectured throughout north america about the 
pyramids said hed never heard of pyramid power until he went 
there in 1977 
i was speaking to an audience in hartford conn and as i 
began to talk everyone in the front row held a pyramid above his 
head i asked what are you doing and they explained about 
power trapped inside the shape of a pyramid 
ok i try to be openminded when i returned i tried some 
experiments 
the first was to test the theory that pyramids can preserve 
bodies 
i bought some meat and put part of it in my office part 
inside cheops the meat inside my office lasted longer than inside 
the pyramid that was one myth down 
if the ancient egyptians knew that flesh could be preserved by 
placing a corpse under a pyramid then why did they invent 
mummification

dreyfus corp is spending upwards of 20 million 
on what may become the mutual fund industrys equivalent of the 
supermarket coupon or the cutrate auto loan 
howard stein chairman and chief executive of the prominent 
moneymanagement firm since 1965 hopes the investment will pay big 
dividends for dreyfus among a giant new generation of investors 
the money is going to cover the management fee and expenses 
normally collected from the fund itself of the dreyfus worldwide 
dollar money market fund which began operations last feb 27 
with its sponsor picking up the costs the worldwide dollar fund 
has predictably ranked among the highestyielding money market 
funds ever since 
as of last wednesday its sevenday yield reported by the 
national association of securities dealers stood at 913 percent 
compared to an industry average of 821 percent 
though it has long been common practice for sponsors of new 
funds to charge no fees during the launching period nobody before 
has taken the idea quite so far 
dreyfus has promised to keep paying the costs at least until 
dec 25 or the point when the funds assets which recently 
surpassed 3 billion reach 35 billion 
at that stage the firm has said it will consider extending the 
cutoff point further 
some skeptical financial advisers have cautioned that this is a 
gimmick an enticement to attract people into a fund whose yield 
is likely to drop back into the pack once dreyfus phases out the 
incentives as it surely must if it is ever going to make any money 
from the venture 
but stein in an interview in his manhattan apartment a half a 
block from central park says there is a distinct purpose behind 
the strategy 
the target he says is a different group of investors the 
younger group thats just beginning to save they have been brought 
up on sales everywhere 
stein seems pleased with the results to date dreyfus has just 
adopted a similar no cost incentive for a fund investing in 
taxexempt municipal securities and plans to use it with some 
other funds as well he says 
after its explosive growth with many new products in the 1980s 
stein says the mutual fund business is becoming a mature 
industry but we are seeing growth in another area 
at a time when the baby boom generation is approaching the age 
when people traditionally increase their savings and investment 
activity he observes the bush administration and congress are 
debating new measures to increase savings for example a 
restoration of the tax break for longterm capital gains 
were looking at a national desire to save and new incentives 
to save coming down the road in the 1990s stein says 
no matter how much emphasis the country places on such things 
however he believes the freewheeling deregulated atmosphere of 
the financial world in the 1980s is going to change 
i expect to see a lot more surveillance and restraints and 
thats all to the good he says a lack of surveillance is not 
a longterm positive when people are not watching somebody will 
take a chance 
for example he says after the boom in debtfinanced takeovers 
and buyouts of the past several years there is a distinct 
possibility of a junkbond episode that will affect the 
marketplace 
conditions are going to be forced to be addressed he adds 
the circumstances that bring on change may be painful he 
acknowledges but the more painful the process the more the 
system will be cleansed

when tracy chapman and melissa etheridge 
recorded followups to their popular debut albums this year they 
turned to the same producers same musicians and in chapmans 
case even the same microphone used the first time around 
it remains to be seen of course if they can duplicate the 
success 
answers will come soon etheridges brave and crazy was 
released in midseptember and chapmans crossroads followed a 
few weeks later 
theyll be trying to defy one of the music business toughest 
obstacles the sophomore jinx music history is replete with 
artists who crumbled under the high expectations caused by 
successful debut albums remember the knack others who fell victim 
to the jinx include christopher cross meat loaf cyndi lauper and 
human league 
the grammy awardwinning chapman burst onto the scene last year 
selling 3 million copies of a folk album filled with gentle love 
songs and pointed political barbs 
in contrast to chapman whose album was an instant 
precedentshattering success etheridge started slowly but her 
album of smoldering rock tunes reached gold status 500000 sales 
when word spread of her bracing live performances 
etheridge seemed to sum up the approach of both artists to their 
sophomore efforts when she talked of her alreadyrecorded new album 
during an april interview 
theres nothing outrageously different she said its 
just the next step technically musically its the same thing 
etheridges manager bill leopold wouldnt allow her to be 
interviewed this fall about the new album both because he didnt 
want her to be mentioned in the same article with another female 
artist and nervousness over the sophomore effort said sandy 
sowatka a publicist at island records 
paranoia is a frequent response to second album pressures 
artists can tie their stomachs in knots worrying about which way to 
turn should they use the same approach as the first album and hear 
accusations that theyre repeating themselves or change styles and 
risk alienating the people who made them a success 
both of those thoughts occurred to me said david 
kershenbaum who coproduced crossroads with chapman 
what it was on the first album was basically her and her 
guitar with us filling in the blanks kershenbaum said thats 
what we did on this new record we didnt do any more and we didnt 
do any less even though we didnt consciously try the record 
turned out differently 
chapman also wouldnt talk about the new record but her sudden 
fame is clearly on her mind the title cut of crossroads talks 
about pressures she faced to sell your soul and concludes with 
the admonition all you demons go back to hell 
she was very clear when she came in and very strong 
kershenbaum said i didnt detect any insecurity at all nowhere 
near what could have been with the pressure of a followup record 
like this 
that wasnt the case with some of the musicians who were a 
little nervous he said 
musicians larry klein denny fongheiser and jack holder all make 
return appearances backing chapman new guests include neil young 
saturday night live guitarist ge smith and former bob dylan 
violinist scarlet rivera chapman used some new guitars but asked 
for the same microphone to duplicate vocals from her debut 
the mix of personal and world politics on crossroads is 
roughly the same as on the first record freedom now is about 
jailed south african leader nelson mandela and material world 
is bitter in its denunciation of upwardly mobile people who forget 
their roots 
both chapman and etheridge seem to have stockpiled material to 
tide them over in case of writers block some of the publishing 
credits on chapmans songs date to 1982 and 1984 while etheridge 
has been performing several of the brave and crazy songs for 
more than a year 
expectations seem to differ slightly for both records 
chapmans record is out in time for the christmas buying season 
but her record company seems to be positioning chapman as an artist 
of longevity such as dylan or joni mitchell said paul grein 
author of billboard magazines chart beat column its also 
significant that the record is out 15 months after the debut he 
said 
anticipation for crossroads is not as high as it would be 
if she had waited longer grein said it would have put more 
pressure on her she was smart to come fairly quickly and get the 
followup out of the way 
etheridges management by contrast seems poised to make the 
kansasborn artist a star the single no souvenirs came out a 
month in advance of the album to whet the audiences appetite and 
etheridge is booked for five nights later this month at the bottom 
line new york citys industry showcase club 
shes positioned very well grein said the first album 
did well and got a great critical reaction but wasnt a home run i 
think shes in a good position to go further with this album 
such songs as no souvenirs the angels and skin deep 
have sweeping rock hooks well designed for frequent radio airplay 
etheridge is still sifting through the shards of shattered 
relationships for her best material but the new record is harder 
rocking less downbeat than the first 
again her acoustic guitar which is attacked more often than 
strummed is at the center of her bands sound etheridge produced 
the record with kevin mccormick and niko bolas just like the debut 
kershenbaum whose own career has blossomed with interest in the 
minimalist style he and chapman used on the first album is 
philosophic about the sophomore pressure 
a lot of people are going to be very interested in seeing how 
the second album does did she beat it does it sound the same was 
she lucky the first time he said what happens with a record 
like that when we have that much exposure is that we come to bat 
in a really heavy posture on the next one 
if we did our job well and people like our songs then thats 
going to help us if they dont like the songs then no matter what 
we did its not going to mean anything

the true test of a summit conference is what 
happens on the way down thats especially so for pseudosummits 
called to deal with problems at home rather than to put leaders of 
world powers across the table from one another 
so the grades for president bushs education summit with the 
governors will not be in until next semester and the results wont 
show for a long time after that 
from this day forward let us be an america of tougher 
standards an america of higher goals and a land of bigger 
dreams bush said after conferring with the governors at the 
university of virginia in charlottesville 
they agreed that there should be national standards by which to 
judge the performance of schools and their students bush also told 
the governors he would seek the added flexibility they want in the 
use of federal education aid 
gov bill clinton of arkansas a leading spokesman on education 
said the success of the summit can be judged on the basis of public 
response to the national goals and ultimately on whether 
students learn more 
thats the point of course with or without national standards 
it is obvious that too many students are not learning enough now 
with a school dropout rate of nearly 30 percent and with an 
estimated 23 million illiterate adults 
bush said that the american people are ready for radical 
reforms in education the changes envisioned in the summit sumup 
didnt sound radical they included holding educators accountable 
for student performance keeping drugs out of schools cutting away 
federal and state educational red tape reducing the dropout rate 
and improving literacy 
the postsummit challenge can hardly be to those common sense 
goals it will be to keep education reform high on the national 
agenda that wont be free although the president and the 
governors carefully avoided debates about more federal spending 
clinton said there would have to be more spending later but the 
goals came first 
you cant do it with poetry said gov mario cuomo of new 
york he and clinton are among 28 democratic governors 
bush who has no budget room to spare anyhow said the focus 
should be on results not resources if anything hard experience 
teaches that we are simply not getting our moneys worth in 
education he said 
the administration estimates that local state and federal 
education spending this year will total 353 billion secretary of 
education lauro cavazos said that is an increase of 24 percent 
since 1983 he said about 6 percent of the total is spent from 
washington 
the education summit itself was a symbol to underscore bushs 
concern about education the white house compared it to franklin d 
roosevelts meeting with governors in 1933 when he summoned them 
to talk about depression measures 
nowadays conferring at the summit a phrase attributed to 
winston churchill has become a washington cliche while bush was 
presiding at the education conference wednesday and thursday the 
deficit deal struck at a budget summit last spring was fraying in a 
congressional struggle over taxes and spending as a presidential 
candidate bush spoke of five different summit meetings on five 
different sets of problems 
when churchill proposed a cold war summit parley he meant a 
meeting among the chiefs of state that kind of summit has become a 
fixture of eastwest diplomacy bush and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev are to hold their first one late next spring or early 
in the summer ronald reagan held five summit meetings with soviet 
leaders 
that kind of summitry puts faces and personalities behind the 
cold issues and hard lines of eastwest rivalries while summit 
meetings have eased tensions delivered treaties and spurred arms 
control they dont always work 
there were those who said that nikita s khrushchevs misreading 
of john f kennedy at their 1961 summit led to the miscalculations 
that produced the cuban missile crisis dwight d eisenhowers 
meeting with khrushchev created what was called the spirit of 
camp david but it didnt last within the year the u2 spy 
plane episode led khrushchev to angrily cancel a 1959 summit in 
paris 
agreements signed at diplomatic summits are written on the way 
up not at the top 
thats not the case at a domestic summit like bushs meeting 
with the governors there scripts have to be written during the 
drama of the summit itself so their agreements tend to be broad 
ones with details to be filled in later but atmosphere is 
important too 
the education summit delivered a sense of commitment urgency 
and determination to deal with a deepening national problem 
thats not an answer but its a beginning

the images of war wrought by hurricane 
hugo conjured up memories of another devastating time in south 
carolina history when the carcasses of houses dotted the landscape 
and the weary mourned for more than their dead 
i feel like my forefathers must have felt at the close of the 
war between the states i think we lost life as we know it said 
w jean woods a councilman in neighboring berkeley county 
our economy has been laid waste our land has been laid waste 
were all emotionally scarred woods said 
this time the villain wasnt an invading army although 
charleston has suffered its share of natural disaster in its 
glorious 319year history 
this time a way of life was gone with a wind named hugo a 
killer that roared across the caribbean and struck a bullseye on

the hurricane and its remnants killed 33 people in the caribbean 
and 29 in the united states including 18 in south carolina the 
12th strongest hurricane to hit the us mainland in this century 
hugo caused an estimated 3 billion damage in this state alone 
charleston a jewel of the old south now with 65000 residents 
has weathered much since it was founded in 1670 the british 
occupied it in the revolutionary war the union bombarded it in the 
civil war 
the city survived a disastrous fire in 1861 and earthquakes in 
1886 and 1893 now it can add hugo to its battle flag 
fort sumter where the first shots of the civil war were fired 
by the first state to secede from the union fell not to 
confederate cannons but to hugos tidal surge it was swamped by a 
17foot wave sustained 1 million damage and is under repair 
charleston just wont ever be the same when the hurricane 
hit it took a piece of charleston with it said renee lappe 30 
it looked like a bomb had been dropped if you ride in the 
streets it makes you want to cry 
in all 63 buildings in charleston collapsed and 381 have severe 
structural damage officials said four of five structures have 
roof damage of some degree 
some buildings in charleston date back to the 1690s its 
historic district sits on a peninsula that sticks out like a tongue 
into its harbor where a fictional rhett butler ran the union 
blockade 
about 75 percent of the citys 3500 building considered to be 
of historical significance were damaged including 20 to 30 that 
were severely damaged or razed then as the second part of a cruel 
combination punch the structures were hit by several inches of 
rain two days after hugo left 
damage to those buildings was put in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars and could take five years to repair according to teams of 
preservationists who rushed to the citys aid from all over the 
country 
were not destroyed but were hurt said lawrence walker of 
the historic charleston foundation grateful that the 
pastelcolored antebellum mansions werent subjected to more ruin 
the mahogany altar at the cathedral of st luke and st paul was 
splintered by a stone roof support that crashed down when hugo 
gouged a gaping hole in the roof of the roman revival structure 
built in 1815 
at least the yankees arent shooting at us this time said 
the very rev nelson koscheski 
as in any battle there were heroes 
in mcclellanville a shrimping village of 500 residents in the 
carolina lowcountry hugo unleashed its mightiest tidal surge of 20 
feet the entire town was devastated boats 68 feet long were 
tossed into yards as if they were toys 
thomas colleton 57 hoisted his family of nine up to the inner 
rafters of his onestory house as waters flooded in and rose up to 
his chest as he lifted the children 
i wanted to be the last one up colleton said later 
when you hear a man screaming for help and nobody can help him 
you know its terrible 
lives are just devastated said jimmy scott 45 as he 
scraped the muck from his home its really gone with the wind 
this time literally theres nothing to do but pick up the pieces 
and start over 
frances graham 74 stacked her furniture and furnishings on the 
front lawn in an attempt to dry them water had surged 10 feet into 
the house a building she had never seen before was dumped in the 
back yard 
it was absolute pandemonium mrs graham said we may be 
scrounging around for food just like scarlett ohara we just dont 
know where to turn 
charleston issued an emergency ordinance to prevent price 
gouging on items such as ice and chain saws a fist fight broke out 
in one ice line 
some looting was also reported in myrtle beach its like 
stealing from a graveyard shopowner connie brewer said 
but for the most part people quietly picked up the pieces 
the national guard enforced a dawntodusk curfew and martial 
law was imposed on the isle of palms one of the barrier islands 
that absorbed the brunt of hugos ferocity 
after getting his first look at the devastation thomas harper 
a retired air force officer said it looks like what happens 
after artillery fire 
some island and coastal residents who may have lost everything 
they had to hugo faced another devastating prospect a state law 
enacted to curb beach erosion may prevent some from rebuilding 
and more than a week after hugo roared through 203000 people 
were without power most of them in the charleston area 
stormbattered residents coped without electricity without hot 
water for showers without ways to cook hot food as convoys of 
electrical workers strung new power lines 
they queued up for meals canned food ice air mattresses gas 
lanterns shoes and clothes at distribution points 
this will keep us alive said a grateful fesella ladson 25 
of charleston carrying a cardboard box filled with emergency 
supplies 
the american red cross mounted a 42 million relief effort the 
most expensive relief effort in its 126year history 
supplies poured in from around the country but folks in the 
rural areas felt the recovery moved glacierlike 
mayor hazel parsonstarkes of ridgeville blamed hugo for the 
worst devastation in any of our lives 
we have no food water power or anything were pleading for 
all the help we can get i just dont know how were going to get 
through this 
hugos fury recalled the ageold awe of caribbean indians who 
bowed before a god of wind named hurrican 
in south carolina its brute energy created incongruous scenes 
boats blown a halfmile inland roofs sheared off trees twisted 
into spaghettilike heaps 
it really rattled us to our roots said dr linda austin of 
the medical university of south carolina 
somehow people began rebuilding their homes and their lives 
some in charleston found a force more indomitable than the guns of 
armies or natures mightiest forces 
kris holmes waited patiently for a leasing company to put the 
roof back on her business terrible toms pastry shop she hoped to 
reopen soon 
its the spirit of charleston she said were survivors

stock speculator ivan boesky secretly 
taperecorded three conversations with indicted junk bond financier 
michael milken in 1986 shortly before boesky was publicly named as 
a government informant court documents reveal 
the nature of the discussions was not disclosed and prosecutors 
and defense lawyers on thursday declined to discuss their content 
but the tapes could emerge as critical evidence in the milkens 
scheduled march 1990 trial on fraud and racketeering charges 
the tape recordings made on oct 1 oct 9 and nov 6 1986 
were mentioned in a letter from the government to lawyers 
representing milken the letter was attached to a recent filing in 
us district court in manhattan 
the final recorded conversation occurred just eight days before 
the revelation that boesky made a deal to cooperate with 
prosecutors in their probe of wall street corruption 
milken the former head of junk bond operations for drexel 
burnham lambert inc was indicted in march on 98 counts of fraud 
and racketeering for an alleged series of schemes with boesky 
boesky in november 1986 agreed to plead guilty to one criminal 
count of filing false information with the government and is 
serving a threeyear jail term 
his stock dealings with milken formed the basis of much of 
milkens indictment principally a 53 million payment from boesky 
to drexel to settle the balance in what the government calls a 
secret arrangement involving insider trading tax fraud rigged 
corporate takeovers and other violations 
it was known that boesky secretly taperecorded conversations 
after he was recruited as an informant but the identities of those 
he taperecorded had not been disclosed previously boesky was 
first implicated in the spring of 1986 by investment banker dennis 
levine and he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors some time that 
summer 
if the tapes contain damaging information about milken they 
could strengthen the governments case but if milken said nothing 
incriminating despite attempts by boesky to trap him it could help 
the defense 
tape recordings were not mentioned in the governments 
indictment of milken and two others the government has said a 
broader indictment is expected in the next month 
the april 24 letter detailing the tapes was attached to a recent 
filing by the government as part of the discovery process in the 
case in which prosecutors are required to inform the defense of 
documents and other evidence gathered 
the letter said the oct 9 conversation was recorded on two 
cassettes while the others were recorded on one tape 
assistant us attorney john k carroll declined to discuss the 
tapes 
milken attorney arthur liman said in a statement released by a 
spokesman for milken as weve said in the past we will not try 
this case in the press and we look forward to a full hearing in 
court 
in an internal securities and exchange commission memo the 
contents of which were published by the washington post earlier 
this month the government said boesky and milken met in july 1986 
to substantiate the consulting services explanation allegedly 
used to conceal the true nature of the 53 million payment

plans for increased cooperation with the united 
states in space exploration could be a boon to japans fledgling 
aerospace industries analysts say 
during a sixday visit to tokyo that ended tuesday us vice 
president dan quayle made space cooperation a top priority in 
forging a global partnership with japan beginning with the 
international freedom space station and a project to measure 
effects of solar radiation on earths magnetic field 
quayle said both sides were considering possible japanese 
collaboration in a new us initiative for space exploration that 
would put a permanent observatory on the moon and send a manned 
mission to mars 
japanese leaders welcomed quayles enthusiastic support for 
international cooperation in space a rare area in which japan lags 
far behind the united states and europe in terms of both technology 
and spending 
partly due to prohibitions imposed by the united states after 
world war ii japan is a latecomer to the aerospace field it has 
relied heavily on foreign technology and while active in 
development of rockets and satellites has no independent manned 
space program 
this summer as the us national space council chaired by 
quayle began mapping out a new us era in space japan was 
drafting a 10year space program to develop an unmanned space plane 
in the next decade and eventually to send its own astronauts into 
space aboard japanesemade spacecraft 
the program also calls for basic research on robots capable of 
assembling and repairing satellites in orbit and for developing a 
rocket capable of lifting commercial payloads into orbit 
constitutional limits on japans military which have slowed 
defenserelated research and low government spending have been 
major handicaps for japans space program 
concerned that us restrictions on securitysensitive and 
advanced technology could close the technology pipeline japan has 
begun channeling more funds into space research although spending 
remains far below that of the united states 
in 1989 japan is spending 11 billion on its space programs 
compared with 9 billion dollars spent by the national aeronautics 
and space administration alone in 1988 
without a substantial increase in commercial spinoffs from 
military and other governmentsponsored space research japan is 
unlikely however to develop a profitable competitive space 
program in the foreseeable future says stephen e marvin an 
analyst at jardine fleming securities ltd in tokyo 
the japanese space industry is tiny in terms of actual 
potential i dont see the emergence of an independent and 
commercially viable aerospace industry anytime soon martin said 
quayle said during his visit to the tsukuba space center east of 
tokyo that instead of fearing competition from japan in space the 
united states hoped japan could help defray the huge cost of space 
exploration he said us charges that japan is not buying enough 
americanmade satellites should not interfere with overall 
cooperation in space science 
japan faces possible retaliation under us super 301 trade 
legislation if it is judged to be unfairly discriminating against 
the usmade satellites 
while japan would like to have a strong space industry it is 
more likely to join international programs that dilute risk while 
facilitating technology transfers 
japan wants to have its own indigenous technology but the 
risks involved in space development are enormous martin said 
aerospace could become japans only truly international 
industry says analyst keith donaldson of james capel and co 
in the past all japanese manufacturing was originally 
domestic and that created trade problems said donaldson the 
ministry of international trade and industry wants to use 
aerospace to internationalize japan he said 
to international projects japan can contribute superior 
electronics technology particularly in radar and visual imaging as 
well as the powerful computer chips needed in sophisticated 
aerospace equipment martin said 
japan is trying to develop its own industry for commercial 
launches of satellites a step that requires upgrading old 
technology borrowed from the united states to develop a rocket able 
to launch heavier payloads its payloads for a geostationary orbit 
currently are limited to 1200 pounds 
to be competitive japan must have a rocket capable of handling 
at least 2000 pounds but japanese researchers have run into 
technical problems that have delayed the launch of the next 
generation h2 rocket by at least one year officials say 
japan also needs to find another location for satellite 
launches says donaldson its equivalent of cape canaveral in 
florida is the tanegashima space center on a small island off the 
southern coast 
the tanegashima facility has been expanded to accommodate the 
h2 rocket program but an agreement with local fishermen restricts 
launches to a 45day period in the summer and another 45day period 
in the winter limiting both experimental progress and future 
commercial launches

women who worry about irritating nonsmokers 
with their cigarettes are targets for the latest tobacco product 
from philip morris usa 
the nations largest cigarette maker announced the national 
launch thursday of a cigarette that it says emits 70 percent less 
smoke from the lighted end than most comparable brands 
the cigarette called superslims from virginia slims also is 
very low in tar and slimmer in shape than most other 100 millimeter 
cigarettes the company said the principal buyers are expected to 
be women 
philip morris maker of the marlboro benson amp hedges and merit 
brands already is the leader in the estimated 40 billion us 
cigarette market with an estimated 41 percent market share but 
overall cigarette sales have been declining at about a 25 percent 
rate for several years 
industry analysts said the new cigarette continues that markets 
trend of offering products that appeal to narrowly defined groups 
in this case women and people concerned about offending nonsmokers 
with their cigarettes 
this is a business based on segmentation said emanuel 
goldman who follows the tobacco business for the investment firm 
painewebber inc 
cutting down on socalled sidestream smoke has become a more 
important concern to cigarette makers who face an increasingly 
hostile regulatory environment 
superslims emit less smoke from the lit end than most other 
brands because of a double wrapping of porous and nonporous 
papers philip morris said the wrapping does not affect the amount 
of smoke which the smoker inhales however 
david er dangoor vice president for marketing at philip 
morris said the lowsmoke feature was something a lot of smokers 
will find to be an advantage as social pressures continue to 
build against smoking 
but he said superslims main attraction is that it combines in 
one cigarette all three features low smoke low tar and extra 
slimness that are currently found only individually in other 
brands 
rj reynolds tobacco co for instance since early this year 
has been testing vantage excel 100s which it says emits less smoke 
from the lit end than other 100millimeter cigarettes 
a number of cigarette brands including virginia slims ultra 
lights match or have lower levels of tar than the 6 milligrams in 
superslims 
and brown amp williamson co another leading tobacco company has 
been selling an extra slim brand called capri since 1987 it filed 
a patent infringement suit against philip morris last may in us 
district court in louisville in an effort to head off the 
introduction of superslims the suit is pending 
both capri and superslims have a circumference of 17 millimeters 
compared with 23 millimeters for virginia slims and 25 millimeters 
for regular brands 
cigarette companies frequently test new brands in a few markets 
before launching them nationally but philip morris a division of 
philip morris cos inc said it was bypassing the test market 
because of the positive reaction women smokers had to superslims in 
interviews 
dangoor refused to say how much philip morris planned to spend 
marketing the cigarettes but said it would be an extremely 
ambitious mix of print outdoor and pointofpurchase ads 
couponing direct mail and promotions 
in one ad planned for magazines next month two pairs of womens 
fingers are shown holding burning cigarettes one pair holds one 
of the leading 100s emiting a heavy curl of smoke while the 
other holds a superslims with only a wisp of smoke 
dangoor said the new cigarettes are totally unrelated to the 
socalled smokeless cigarette called premier which reynolds 
discontinued earlier this year after a disastrous run of several 
months in test markets premier used a burning carbon element to 
heat tobacco without burning it 
this is a real cigarette that burns tobacco dangoor said of 
superslims

sony corp has agreed to buy the moviemaker 
guberpeters entertainment co inc and indicated its owners would 
be offered roles at another prospective sony operation columbia 
pictures entertainment inc 
sony said thursday it agreed to pay 1750 a share or 200 
million for guberpeters the hollywood company headed by 
producers peter guber and jon peters that counts the movie hits 
batman and rain man among its credits 
including guberpeters debt that sony will inherit the deal is 
valued at 240 million 
the move came a day after sony the japanese electronics giant 
took its biggest step into the software side of the 
entertainment business by agreeing to pay 34 billion for new 
yorkbased columbia pictures 
a potential snag to the deal developed thursday however when 
three columbia shareholders filed a lawsuit in los angeles county 
superior court attempting to block the takeover 
the suit filed by shareholders elfriede glancy linda zelden 
and melvyn zupnick accused columbias board of directors of 
settling for an offer from sony that was far less than what the 
company is worth it asks that the board be ordered to cooperate 
with others seeking to buy the company 
a sony spokesman in tokyo tom sugiyama said the suit was a 
matter between columbia and its shareholders and that sony had no 
other comment 
the purchase of guberpeters dramatizes sonys eagerness to 
shore up columbias floundering film production 
guberpeters has a tangible net worth of just 2 a share 
according to michael tennenbaum vice chairman of investment 
banking for bear stearns and co which appraised the sony offer 
for the guberpeters board 
but the company has much greater intrinsic value tennenbaum 
said because of its television assets future profit payoffs from 
batman and most important because of its management and 
track record guber and peters are considered to be two of 
hollywoods hottest producers 
in announcing that its board agreed to the deal with sony 
columbia said its president and chief executive victor a kaufman 
and its chief operating officer lewis j korman had indicated 
they intended to move on to other endeavors before any deal was 
completed 
there have been published reports that guber would be asked to 
replace kaufman at columbia once the acquisition is completed 
kaufman and guber failed to respond to repeated requests for 
comment 
michael schulhof vice chairman of sony corp of america also 
declined to comment directly on those reports thursday 
but he said in a telephone interview we are hopeful that the 
management of guberpeters will work out some of their existing 
contractual arrangements in a way that will make it possible for 
them to join columbia pictures 
guber and peters recently renewed a fiveyear production 
contract with columbia rival warner bros and are working on a 
batman sequel due in 1991 and film adaptations of the books 
bonfire of the vanities and a bright shining lie for warner 
rights to those films are owned by warner bros and it is 
conceivable that guberpeters might still make them for the rival 
studio columbia would benefit by receiving a share of the films 
profits through guberpeters 
a spokesman for warner rob friedman declined comment on the 
contracts with guber and peters 
the two producers have worked together for years and industry 
executives said it was unlikely that one of them would take a role 
at columbia without the other 
two years ago guber and peters merged their privatelyheld 
production company with barris industries which made the gong 
show among other tv programs 
in the fiscal year ended may 31 guberpeters lost 192 million 
on revenue of 237 million the company has yet to realize any 
profits from either the academy awardwinning rain man or 
batman one of hollywoods most successful films 
sony said it intended to begin a tender offer for all of 
guberpeters shares next week that is also when it intends to

something is happening to herbs theyre no 
longer just for gourmet cooks and snooty restaurants says 
agriculture department economist cathy greene 
from the wellknown garlic clove to jasmine and foxglove herbs 
are used for such diverse purposes as cooking landscaping bridal 
wreaths and aromatherapy 
according to recently released 1987 census of agriculture 
estimates there has been a dramatic increase in us herb farming 
greene said the acreage rose 122 percent between 1982 and 1987 and 
the quantity harvested jumped 248 percent 
greene writing in the october issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said food service and retail suppliers are enlarging 
their herbgrowing operations and are building new hightech 
packing houses to handle the crops 
the international herb growers and marketers association for 
example has more than doubled its membership from 450 only three 
years ago to 1050 today 
but greene who works for the departments economic research 
service added thursday in a telephone interview that no herbs 
arent about to crowd wheat and soybeans off the charts at least 
not yet 
aromatherapy is something new in the scent world greene said 
its hard to define satisfactorily but it has to do with 
fragrances affecting human wellbeing and attitudes something like 
that 
we know that use of fresh culinary herbs has skyrocketed 
she said but right now theres no way to get a good estimate of 
their total value 
why the herb surge one reason is the availability herbs 
garnish produce counters virtually in every supermarket 
instead of having to go to a restaurant and having them served 
to you where they have made special arrangements to get herbs 
having them available at grocery stores has made a difference 
greene said 
sometimes herbs can be marketed through several channels for 
example both fresh and dried rosemary is available at some 
supermarkets and its also sold as a potted plant at herb garden 
nurseries farm markets often carry rosemary wreaths during the 
winter 
garlic is also sold for cooking as a dietary supplement and is 
braided with dried flowers for sale as decorations by upscale 
kitchen boutiques and farmers markets its supposed to ward off 
vampires too 
feverfew is used in herbal landscaping design and some medical 
reports suggest it may be effective in preventing migraine 
headaches 
other examples cited by greene include jasmine which is used in 
teas as well as highgrade perfumes and foxglove used as an 
ornamental plant and in the cardiovascular drug digitalis 
according to a 1989 consumer survey by the packer an industry 
publication the top five fresh herbs in consumer recognition are 
garlic 95 percent of those questioned parsley 86 percent dill 
67 percent chives 66 percent and ginger root 59 percent 
more than half of those surveyed had seen or heard of fresh 
basil while a third or more had seen or heard of fresh mint 
horseradish oregano sage thyme rosemary and anise twentyseven 
percent recognized cilantro and marjoram 
herbgrowing operations range from hobby farmers and back yard 
nurseries in cities to openair farms with more than several 
hundred acres 
according to the 1987 agricultural census california leads in 
garlic and parsley acreage while hawaii is the only us producer 
of ginger root washington state leads in dill acreage and oregon 
has the most mint 
california is also the top producer of all other herbs a 
category that includes fresh culinary herbs such as basil chives 
thyme and rosemary 
wisconsin is the largest producer of herbs in an aggregate 
category greene said most of wisconsins herb acreage however 
is for cultivated ginseng not for culinary herbs most of the crop 
is exported to asian countries where ginseng is used as a medicine 
meanwhile imports of fresh herbs are also up she said these 
shipments are used both for fresh market sales and in food 
processing 
total imports of 17 herbs shipped fresh to the united states 
increased to 14 million pounds in 1987 up 6 percent from 1986 and 
22 percent more than in 1985 the largest imports in order were 
garlic cilantro ginger root oregano and parsley

proposed market reform legislation to 
strengthen the securities and exchange commission has met with at 
least partial approval from the nations top stock market officials 
the presidents of the new york stock exchange the american 
stock exchange and the national association of securities dealers 
told a house subcommittee thursday that they favored most or all of 
the four key points proposed in the stock market reform act of 1989 
also testifying before the subcommittee was the president of the 
chicago mercantile exchange who said introduction of a handheld 
computer to record trades on the nations two largest futures 
exchanges is at least a year away 
cme president william j brodsky said the exchange and the 
chicago board of trade were spending 5 million just for 
development of the computerized recordkeeping system proposed 
in the wake of a wave of indictments for alleged massive fraud 
schemes by traders and brokers on both futures exchanges 
the market reform bill was proposed in the wake of the 1987 
stock market crash when the dow jones industrial average dropped 
more than 500 points it would grant the sec authority to halt 
securities trading for up to 24 hours in an emergency situation 
described as a major market disturbance 
nyse president richard a grasso and amex president kenneth r 
leibler approved of that idea but the nasds joseph r hardiman 
said he opposed trading halts 
as a general principle we think that markets should strive to 
remain open under all market conditions to provide the liquidity 
and price discovery on which individual and institutional investors 
rely he said in a prepared statement that accompanied his 
tesimony 
the fact that the markets remained open and functioning 
although not perfectly during the market break of october 1987 
probably averted a much more serious financial crisis continued 
the statement by the nasd which oversees the overthecounter 
stock market 
hardiman joined the two exchange officials in supporting another 
aspect of the bill that called for the sec the commodity futures 
trading commission and the federal reserve board to link or 
coordinate their facilities for clearing and settling trades in 
securities options futures contracts and other transactions 
but hardiman said he also had questions about two other points 
of the bill new requirements for reporting large stock trades and 
rules for assessing the financial soundness of holding companies 
that are the parent companies of brokerdealers 
the others disagreed with him however when rep edward j 
markey dmass asked should we be concerned about the stability 
of securities firms which have accepted large bridge loans 
traditionally a bridge loan is a shortterm loan in 
anticipation of longterm financing but in the recent wave of 
leveraged buyouts mergers and takeovers investment banks that 
make bridge loans frequently cover their own risk exposure by 
selling highyield junk bonds 
the junk bond market weakened by the credit troubles of 
canadian retailing giant campeau corp last week has scared off 
investors and raised concerns on capitol hill that would stick wall 
street investment banks with big loans they might have trouble 
refinancing 
in light of published reports of losses of as much as 20 
million to 30 million in the junk bond market grasso told markey 
chairman of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee i think its an area that is 
well worth our continuing focus and certainly from the point of 
view measuring the ability to assess risk it is absolutely 
critical that we have that we have that provision in your bill 
liebler agreed saying there may well be situations in which 
the financial viability of a brokerdealer cannot be fully gauged 
without such a risk assessment

labor leaders welcomed alfred checchis 
emergence as chairman of nwa inc even though the change came 
sooner than many expected and in the face of defections from top 
management ranks 
checchi 41 led a 365 billion buyout of northwest airlines 
parent in june on thursday the carrier said chairman steven 
rothmeier resigned for personal reasons after holding the position 
since 1986 four other top executives also resigned 
i suspect that mr checchi was surprised by the 
resignations said northwest spokesman alan muncaster 
muncaster said checchi was informed wednesday of the 
resignations which will take effect oct 15 before wednesday the 
los angeles investor had repeatedly said he wanted rothmeier to 
continue as chairman 
checchi named frederic malek as president to replace president 
and chief operating officer john horn malek and checchi will split 
the chief executive duties previously handled by rothmeier 
muncaster said 
also resigning from the airline were benjamin g griggs jr 
executive vice president of nwa companies allan pray executive 
vice presidentinternational and william sitter executive vice 
presidentadministration and chief information officer 
none could be reached for comment thursday 
james cronin former president and chief executive officer of 
tiger international was named executive vice president and 
chairman of nwa companies including the northwest aerospace 
training corp mlt vacations and northwest aircraft inc 
im getting reports from membership that its a pretty 
positive move said guy cook chairman of the international 
association of machinists district lodge 143 the carriers largest 
union 
cook said any rift between rothmeier and checchi could include 
differing views of labor he said rothmeier inherited a byzantine 
outlook from predecessors donald nyrop and m joseph lapensky 
nyrop is legendary for removing doors from the toilet stalls in the 
employee wash rooms at northwest to discourage lengthy bathroom 
breaks 
i think checchi has given clear indications that he wishes to 
change the direction of managementlabor relations cook said 
jim halvorson a spokesman for the local unit of the air line 
pilots association said he had expected rothmeiers team to stay 
in place up to a year after the buyout but he too welcomed new 
management 
us transportation secretary samuel skinner who is reviewing 
the buyout had no warning of the resignations muncaster said he 
said it was too early to tell what impact the change will have on 
skinners review 
muncaster said there was no indication that checchis 
chairmanship would be temporary management by checchi and malek 
would definitely be handson he added 
cook said the split was inevitable because rothmeier was 
accustomed to reporting to a docile board of directors since june 
rothmeier has had to answer to checchi a former marriott corp 
executive who also worked as a dealmaker for the bass brothers of 
texas 
when you have two very strongwilled egos butting heads at 
that level you know it wont last long cook said 
neither checchi nor malek has airline experience but both 
worked for marriott which has close ties to the industry in 
addition malek was a finalist in december 1987 for the top job at 
united airlines malek a merchant banker from washington dc 
also worked on the staff of former president richard nixon and was 
an investor in checchis buyout group 
us rep james oberstar dminn chairman of the house 
aviation subcommittee said the change at northwest was necessary 
to improve the companys prickly labormanagement relations 
rothmeier oversaw the 1986 acquisition of republic airlines and 
led managements fight against a hostile takeover bid of northwest 
launched early this year by oil billionaire marvin davis the 
takeover battled ended in june when checchis group completed its 
allcash buyout of the carrier for 121 a share rothmeier said at 
the time that he considered rothmeiers group to be friendly

a settlement offer is on the table in an 
antitrust lawsuit that alleged visa and mastercard conspired to 
undermine the competition in developing a national debit card 
a debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card but 
the money is automatically deducted from the cardholders account 
and transferred to the merchant 
the settlement proposal was made thursday by lloyd costantine 
chief of the antitrust unit of the state attorney generals office 
in new york on behalf of the 13 states that sued visa and 
mastercard 
the suit filed june 26 in us district court in manhattan 
charged that visa and mastercard tried to undermine the competition 
by gaining control of the nations two largest automatic teller 
machine networks 
the two networks cirrus system inc of downers grove ill 
and plus system inc of denver had been formulating their own 
plans for national debit card networks in the early and mid1980s 
visa also took over the interlink network based in san mateo 
calif the nations largest regional debit card network 
the lawsuit also charged that in 1987 visa and mastercard 
formed a joint venture called entree to develop the debit card but 
purposely dragged their feet on the plan 
in the settlement proposal the states offered to drop their 
efforts to compel visa and mastercard to divest cirrus plus and 
interlink in return visa and mastercard would drop the entree 
venture 
costantine said the settlement would allow visa or mastercard to 
separately develop a national debit card 
however he said the states want a provision people who are 
credit cardholders of both visa and mastercard to have debit 
accounts with only one of the companies 
the other states that filed suit were california connecticut 
louisiana maryland massachusetts minnesota tennessee texas 
utah washington west virginia and wisconsin 
costantine said the states decided to offer a settlement because 
entree was not yet on the market and because they felt the 
companies had no intention of putting the national debit card in 
operation 
barry brett the attorney for visa and stanley robinson 
mastercards lawyer said they would discuss the settlement offer 
with the states the two companies are to respond to the lawsuit on 
nov 6

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge rose 03 percent in august its second consecutive advance 
indicating continued growth in the months ahead the commerce 
department reported today 
the increase in the index of leading indicators designed to 
foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future 
followed a 01 percent gain in july it declined 01 percent in 
june 
todays index reinforced recent government and private industry 
reports indicating that the nations longest peacetime economic 
expansion will reach its seventh birthday in december 
i think if were going to have a recession it probably wont 
start before then and i still think we will squeeze through 1990 
without one said lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser at 
the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa but it wont be very buoyant 
growth 
so far this year the leading indicators have bounced back and 
forth up in january april july and august and down in 
february march may and june in the past three consecutive 
declines sometimes but not always have signaled a forthcoming 
recession 
this trendless result for 1989 seems consistent with the slow 
growth experience of the overall economy said ysabel burns 
mcaleer of the american financial services association 
five of the 11 forwardlooking business statistics that make up 
the composite index contributed to the august gain an increase in 
manufacturers new orders higher stock prices an increase in the 
money supply lower inital unemployment claims and increased 
building permits 
the others pointed down a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence lower prices for sensitive meaterials indicating 
slower demand a decrease in manufactuers unfilled orders fewer 
orders for plants and equipment faster vendor deliveries meaning 
declining demand and a shorter workweek 
the various changes left the index at 1444 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 so far this year the index has risen at an annual 
rate of 38 percent compared with an increase of 45 percent for 
all of 1988 
the economy has been growing steadily since november 1982 when 
the nation came out of its last recession but many thought it 
might be pushed into another downturn this year by federal reserve 
efforts to slow inflation 
beginning in march 1988 the fed gradually tightened the 
nations credit supply its goal became known as the 
softlanding continued but slower economic growth to keep 
inflationary pressures in rein 
some economists like david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a 
new york government securities dealer try to avoid the 
softlanding description 
the term is so overused that i hate to use it jones said 
in some sense its not a landing story at all its an economy 
thats growing at lower altitude of gnp gross national product 
growth than we saw last year 
the lower altitude is reflected in several recent reports by 
government and private economists 
the feds latest survey of conditions around the country for 
instance found the economy continuing the grow at the midpoint of 
the third quarter at a pace ranging from slow to moderate 
depending on region 
and the national association of business economists on monday 
released a report saying nearly twothirds of the 72 forecasting 
experts it surveyed said they think a recession is not likely 
before 1991 a third of those said another recession will not 
arrive until 1992 or later 
it was a dramatic reversal from a nabe survey last february 
which found 75 percent of the participants expected a recession 
this year or next

entertainer merv griffin has a 
license to run a casino but it came with a lecture from regulators 
angry that he failed to quickly cut ties with an associate who 
allegedly had indirect links to underworld figures 
griffin who bought resorts international inc from donald trump 
last year will face another challenge in february when he goes 
before the casino control commission for relicensure of the 
debtridden casino 
resorts suspended interest payments to bondholders last month 
saying it wasnt generating enough cash to pay its bills and make 
needed repairs to the hotelcasino resorts bondholders still must 
approve a proposed refinancing which the company says may be 
necessary to keep it from seeking bankruptcy reorganization 
griffin said thursday that in retrospect he probably would not 
have bought resorts 
i probably wouldnt have done this deal but i would have done 
some kind of atlantic city deal griffin said 
on thursday casino control commission chairman walter read 
criticized griffin for maintaining ties with his longtime business 
manager michael nigris after learning of accusations that nigris 
had ties to organized crime 
nigris denies the allegations 
griffin testified that his first knowledge of the allegations 
came in august 1988 when the investment firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc informed him that nigris had associations with 
underworld figures drexel was underwriting the financing of the 
resorts deal 
griffin hired his own investigators who raised similar 
allegations and reported them to the state division of gaming 
enforcement 
griffin removed nigris from any involvement in the resorts 
transaction and fired marvin kern whom nigris had hired to monitor 
the acquisition of resorts but did not terminate other business 
relationships with nigris until this may 
the entertainer said he retained nigris because nigris had not 
been charged with any crime and was a victim of guilt by 
association 
nigris also was interviewed under oath by the state gaming 
division and he has launched a legal battle to keep confidential 
the results of the probe concerning his associations 
nigris on thursday condemned the casino commissions comments 
about him and rejected suggestions that he had ties to people with 
links to organized crime 
i am distressed to learn that the commission has chosen to 
rely upon and disclose the conclusions of a report that are 
baseless and unfounded i have had a long and distinguished 
business career at no time have i associated with members of 
organized crime nigris said in a statement read by his lawyer 
david j satz 
satz would not comment further 
read said the reasons griffin gave for firing nigris which 
centered on griffins dissatisfaction with the acquisition of a 
boston radio station were disturbing 
it seems fair to say from the record as a whole that griffin 
continued to employ nigris after the investigative reports because 
it was in his business interest to do so and terminated nigris 
only when nigris business performance became unsatisfactory 
said read 
but read said the one incident should not cause the panel to 
question griffins good character honesty and integrity

britains panel on takeovers and mergers rejected 
today an appeal by bat industries plc to reverse a decision giving 
hoylake investments ltd more time to complete its 22 billion 
hostile bid for the conglomerate 
the regulatory panels appeal committee upheld the sept 15 
decision that bat shareholders should have the chance to consider 
the hoylake offer free from us regulatory obstacles 
in principle we see no reason for disagreeing with the 
decision of the full panel the committee said in a statement 
hoylake which is led by financier sir james goldsmith had 
sought the extension because it must seek approval of regulatory 
authorities in the united states before it can acquire bats 
farmers insurance group inc 
a bidder in britain usually is given 90 days to win control of 
its target a deadline hoylake is not expected to meet without an 
extension a bidder generally must wait a year before renewing its 
offer 
the takeover panel ruled that hoylake could make a new offer for 
bat within 21 days of overcoming its regulatory obstacles in the 
united states 
bat had argued to the appeals committee that allowing hoylake 
more time would place the conglomerate under siege 
bat stock was unchanged at 818 pence or 1333 a share in 
early trading on londons stock exchange 
hoylake has offered 878 pence or 1431 in securities for each 
bat share on july 11 
bat said friday after the panel announced its decision its 
shareholders have shown quite clearly that hoylakes proposals 
are wholly unacceptable 
although hoylake is now 11 weeks into its bid bat said only a 
minuscule number of shareholders have accepted the offer at 
the last announced count hoylake had obtained less than 3 percent 
of bats shares 
analysts have said hoylake must put some cash into its offer for 
the bid to succeed 
goldsmiths group it welcomed the appeals committee decision 
hoylake has said it plans to sell farmers to the french 
insurance company axa midi assurances 
to this end hoylake and its advisers are in discussion with 
axa midi and its advisers to coordinate their activities in the 
us in the most efficient manner hoylake said 
on tuesday bat announced a major restructuring designed to fend 
off bats bid 
bats plans are to pare its operations into two core areas of 
financial services and tobacco through the sale and spinoffs of its 
retail and paper businesses 
bats shareholders are to vote on these proposals on oct 19 
hoylake has said it would vote in favor of the bat restructuring 
as a first step toward breaking up the conglomerate hoylake wants 
to sell off all of bats nontobacco assets

the massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators 
in beijings tiananmen square last june has cost the peoples 
republic at least 1 billion in lost tourist revenues a chinese 
official said thursday 
we lost 1 billion or so this year said chinese counsel 
general zheng wanzhen of san francisco after a brief appearance at 
a meeting of the international association of travel research and 
marketing professionals 
a panel of asian experts said the lost tourist revenues would 
total 13 billion by the end of the year 
the official chinese government travel service had expected 
tourist revenues of 26 billion this year up from 2 billion in 
1988 
zheng was optimistic that the tourist trade would snap back 
by next year it will be fully recovered he predictedwhat 
happened in june and july is a very minor event in the course of 
chinas history 
but others at the meeting disagreed on how quickly travel to 
china would pick up 
tour operator lee marona said it would be a slow process 
chinas tourism industry today is in serious trouble miller 
said while he encouraged travel professionals to send clients to 
china he recommended they travel in groups 
individual travel especially in the disturbed areas should 
be kept to a minimum miller said 
a survey of us travel agents and tour operators by the pacific 
asia travel association indicated that only 8 percent of clients 
with summer reservations for china kept their plans safety was the 
main reason cited for changing or canceling plans said jerry 
piccolla pata vice president

benefits it will provide for vermont american shareholders as well 
as its employees customers and the communities in which it 
operates he said 
bill anderson a spokesman for emerson electric said the 
buyers intention is to operate the company as its structured 
now 
emerson and bosch plan to retain the current management of the 
louisvillebased vermont american and anticipate no layoffs or 
plant closings anderson said 
nearly 4000 people are employed by vermont american 
in a statement emerson and bosch said they will form a new

new company 
vermont americans biggest customer sears roebuck and co

atlanta would be the headquarters of a proposed 
computer reservation system combining the systems of delta air 
lines northwest airlines and trans world airlines 
the airlines said thursday they had reached a preliminary 
agreement for the joint venture 10 days after it was disclosed 
that the companies were discussing such a plan 
the system would be autonomous and independently managed but 
delta would own the largest portion and one of its executives would 
be the new companys chief executive officer 
ownership of the new system was carved up according to the 
relative size of the carriers in the industry said delta spokesman 
jim lundy 
the system would combine the technologically superior pars 
reservation system started three years ago by nwa and twa with 
deltas datas ii system delta will pay 48 million to twa under 
the proposal 
the announcement earlier this month that the three carriers were 
talking came as no surprise to industry observers who had expected 
delta to pursue some type of venture after a previous attempt to 
merge its reservation system with industry leader sabre owned by 
american airlines parent amr corp ran into regulatory roadblocks 
lundy said the airlines decided to announce the discussions 
earlier this month because we knew it would leak out 
the proposed datas iisabre plan was dropped after the justice 
department threatened to file an antitrust suit the agency said 
that venture would harm competition in the computerized sale of 
airline tickets 
industry analysts have said the new plan is less likely to draw 
such opposition because pars is considerably smaller than sabre 
sabre is used by 12800 travel agency offices and is the biggest 
of the five us computerized reservation systems lundy said pars 
is in third place and datas ii is no 5 
lundy declined to predict how big a market share the new company 
would have because it would be about four years before it is 
running 
though no single carrier will control the new company 
atlantabased delta will own the largest chunk at 40 percent 
eagan minnbased northwest will own 333 percent and new 
yorkbased twa will own 266 percent 
the joint system would be consistent with the design of emerging 
international reservations systems the three airlines said in an 
announcement 
the three airlines also said other carriers will have an 
opportunity to become partners 
when the agreement is finalized a data center will be designed 
and built in atlanta the new company will begin developing 
software and operating systems for the joint venture the company 
also will have marketing offices in kansas city 
reservations systems make money from fees charged to airlines a 
carrier pays the system a fee whenever it books a flight for that 
airline 
the computer systems are the primary channel for distributing 
airline tickets they provide information about schedules fares 
seat availability hotels car rentals and package vacations 
cal rader vice president for marketing automation at delta is 
to be chief executive officer of the joint system

spuds mackenzie funloving party dog from 
anheuserbusch cos inc meet your new partner shamu that 
wellknown killer whale 
anheuserbusch announced thursday it agreed to pay 11 billion 
for the four sea world parks around the country plus two other 
theme parks from harcourt brace jovanovich inc 
we have considered sea world as the ideal acquisition for some 
period of time said w randolph baker vice president and group 
executive for anheuser busch 
the deal will make the brewer the second largest theme park 
operator in america behind walt disney co and will help harcourt 
pay off the huge debt the publishing and insurance company 
accumulated in thwarting a hostile takeover two years ago 
but wall street apparently was displeased with the deal 
harcourt stock had plunged 387 a share to 1237 in early 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
stock analysts who follow anheuserbusch applauded the 
acquisition but said it will have very little impact on the st 
louisbased companys profits or makeup 
this is a real drop in the beer barrel but its a 
diversification move thats going to work and thats better than 
one that doesnt work said julie neiman a st louisbased 
analyst for stifel nicolaus amp co inc 
anheuserbusch the worlds leading beer maker has four core 
businessess beer food container manufacturing and family 
entertainment however 90 precent of the companys sales come from 
beer and beerrelated ventures 
the sea world acquisition will give us a broad base for future 
expansion said baker he said the purchase should be completed 
in november 
anheuserbusch already operates busch gardens in tampa fla 
one of the biggest zoos in the country a 17th century 
europeanstyle park in williamsburg va a water park in tampa 
and a futuristic childrens park near philadelphia 
the company also is planning a major theme park and resort in 
spain along the mediterranean coast just south of barcelona 
according to baker its scheduled to open in 1992 or 1993 
the popular sea world parks which feature performing killer 
whales trained dolphins and other talented creatures from the sea 
are located in san diego orlando fla san antonio texas and 
aurora ohio 
the other parks involved in the deal are boardwalk and baseball 
in orlando and cypress gardens in winter haven fla the purchase 
also includes land adjacent to the three florida parks the sea 
world of texas and the orlando airport 
overall attendance at the parks was 145 million last year 
analysts say harcourt brace jovanovich a leading textbook 
publisher is selling the parks in an effort to pay off a nearly 
29 billion debt it accumulated when the orlandobased company 
fended off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt by british 
communications mogul robert maxwell 
they harcourt brace didnt have a whole lot of choice 
said robert dunlap jr analyst for brown brothers harriman in new 
york 
but in giving up the theme park business harcourt brace also is 
relieving itself of chronic management problems and falling 
attendance at the six parks 
in 1988 sales at the parks totaled 388 million and pretax 
earnings were 62 million this year pretax earnings were 
projected to rise to 90 million analysts said 
only two bidders for the park actually went public with their 
plans one was a group of former harcourt brace and sea world 
executives led by sea world founder george millay the other was 
florida leisure acquisition corp which owns the silver springs 
attraction in ocala 
harcourt brace has been in the theme park business for 13 years 
the purchase price of 11 billion includes 975 for the theme 
parks and the rest for the harcourt braces land holdings the 
agreement also calls for harcourt brace to receive half of the 
profits over 100 million from any sale of this land

apple computer inc has become the 
first us electronics company to decline to join the chipmaking 
consortium called us memories inc 
at this time we have decided not to fund them an apple 
spokeswoman confirmed thursday it doesnt fit into our top 
priorities right now 
us memories is a 1 billion collaborative venture aimed at 
breaking us dependence on foreignmade memory chips known as 
drams or dynamic randomaccess memory chips 
drams are used in everything from computers to fax machines and 
japanese companies dominate the worlds supply 
the consortiums success depends on finding companies willing to 
invest in capital in return for an assured supply of drams but 
industry analysts said apples decision is an isolated letdown 
its not a turning point said fred jones a semiconductor 
analyst with dataquest inc in san jose im not sure it would 
discourage another company from participating if they thought it 
was to their advantage to do so 
a shortage of memory chips last year led apple to hike the price 
of its computers which hurt the companys profits however apple 
now says it can fill its dram needs without another source 
us memories was caught off guard by the apple 
announcement said bruce entin spokesman for chairman will 
corrigan sanford kane president and chief executive told the 
semiconductor industry association tuesday that he was negotiating 
with 17 companies none of which had turned him down

the department of transportation today 
announced approval of the wings holdings co inc takeover of 
northwest airlines after first insisting on steps to prevent 
foreign control of the airline 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said an agreement with 
northwest will alleviate government concerns about the interest of 
klm royal dutch airlines and foreign banks in the takeover by the 
holding company set up by los angeles investor alfred checchi 
skinner has said the government is concerned about increasing 
foreign investment in us airlines because it could compromise 
negotiations with foreign governments over routes 
checchi at a news conference with skinner said in a statement 
that he disagreed with some of the governments conclusions in the 
365 billion deal including the influence klm would have over the 
company 
we do not agree that klm is or has ever been in a position 
to exercise any actual control over nwa checchi said in the 
statement 
however checchi said wings had agreed to reduce klms interest 
dissolve a threemember klm financial advisory committee and take 
away the voting power of klms one seat on nwas 12member board on 
certain issues 
skinner praised checchi as a man with an outstanding reputation 
with both management and employees as part of the agreement to 
approve the takeover the department will conduct a continuing 
review of northwests finances requiring regular reports from the 
company 
the department also had expressed concern about the more than 3 
billion in debt that the takeover gives the airline the nations 
sixth largest 
under the original arrangement klm was providing 400 million 
of the 700 million that checchi raised to buy northwest but would 
have controlled only 5 percent of its voting stock 
the transportation department concluded however that the deal 
would put klm in a position to exercise control over northwest 
and that it would in effect no longer be considered a us carrier 
under the law 
foreign companies cannot own more than 25 percent of a us 
airline 
skinner said the department has an obligation to determine 
whether any acquisition will allow an airline to continue giving 
safe service and remain under the control of us citizens 
earlier this week the government asked united airlines to 
disclose how much a planned employee management takeover will allow 
foreign influence over that airline the 65 billion stock buyout 
plan includes participation from british airways 
skinner declines to respond to questions on the departments 
review of that transaction

when the next hollywood blockbuster hits american 
movie screens you may be able to say its a sony 
sony corp says its 34 billion purchase of columbia pictures 
entertainment inc which follows its 1987 buyout of cbs records 
is aimed at getting involved in making software to use in the 
audiovisual equipment it sells 
but dont worry about rambo decked out as a samurai next time 
around or michael jackson singing in japanese 
what sony wants out of these american companies say analysts 
is for them to keep doing what theyre best at turning out the 
americanstyle entertainment that dominates cinema and music 
markets worldwide 
sonys recent wheeling and dealing involved some of americas 
pop icons rambo bruce springsteen and cocacola co to name a 
few 
sony announced wednesday it is buying the columbia studios home 
of rambo two years ago it plunked down 2 billion for cbs records 
which has contracts with stars such as springsteen and michael 
jackson 
meanwhile cocacola stands to collect 145 billion from 
selling its 49 percent share in columbia to sony 
but while a few american pundits have raised concerns that sony 
may use its new media clout for propaganda purposes industry 
analysts in tokyo scoff 
i dont think they would be so stupid says martin 
beresford a senior analyst at jardine fleming securities 
propaganda films probably wouldnt be great hits at the box office 
he notes and censorship would be too dangerous 
sony is far too sophisticated to consider something as 
blatantly inappropriate as propaganda or censorship they know 
that even the merest whiff of that would constitute an enormous 
public relations risk 
analysts say sony has taken a handsoff policy at cbs records 
leaving the musicmaking to americans while providing japanese 
financial backing so far this formula has made the cbs venture far 
more profitable than analysts had expected 
sonys last annual report noted with satisfaction that a large 
number of hit albums from cbs contributed to a 379 percent 
annual increase in overall sales which hit 162 billion in the 
year ended march 31 the companys net income at 549 million was 
up 946 percent from the previous year 
as is the case with cbs records we would intend to operate 
columbia as a us company with us management sony president 
norio ohga said 
in effect sony wants to sell american software what used 
to be known as movies and television shows in new forms such as 
laser disks and 8mm video tapes 
analysts say its a rational division of labor 
while japanese electronics companies are crack manufacturers and 
exporters of geewhiz technology the japanese film and music 
industries are about as competitive in world markets as american 
soy sauce makers 
us movies by contrast are one of americas biggest export 
success stories from london to bangkok to katmandu hollwood is 
dreamseller to the world with entertainment ranking as americas 
second largest export netting 5 billion annually 
rambo can be seen surreptitiously in even isolationist burma 
the last emperor also a columbia film was shown in china in 
south korea american films are so popular that alleged agents of 
local filmmakers fearing competition released snakes and tear gas 
into theaters to discourage people from seeing directly distributed 
us films 
the reception in tokyo is friendlier japanese love american 
films as much as americans love japanese electronics america 
exports more movies to japan than to any other single market 
entertainment is one area in which the united states enjoys a 
surplus with its economic archrival 
for many japanese movies means american movies they dont 
think of american films as foreign films says hidekazu tanaka 
an official at columbia pictures tokyo branch 
among films shown in japan last year 289 were american 
according to the motion picture association of america only 102 
were japanese 
the top four grossing films in japanese history were et 
star wars jaws and ghostbusters according to 
industry statistics 
ghostbusters a columbia release brought in profits of 
178 million in 1984 fatal attraction recovered all of its 
production costs in japanese theaters alone 
sony is reportedly eager to expand the number of columbias 
library of more than 2700 movies available on laser disk and 8mm 
video classic columbia films popular in japan include bridge 
over the river kwai lawrence of arabia and on the 
waterfront

the government said friday it would postpone its 
huge privatization of the electricity industry for up to six months 
because of the complexity of the selloff 
energy secretary john wakeham said in a statement the 
government remains on target to complete the privatization of the 
industry within this parliament before the next election 
but he said sticking to the previous timetable would require 
additional transitional arrangements which would have introduced 
added complexity to the task and made it more difficult for us to 
meet our objective 
the next general election must be called before mid1992 
the government plans to split into two companies the central 
electricity generating board which now has a monopoly to supply 
electricity to england and wales 
the 12 existing regional boards are to be turned into companies 
that will buy electricity and sell it to homes and industry in 
their regions 
the electricity area boards are expected to be sold off in the 
fall of 1990 instead of next spring or summer the generating 
companies are to be sold in first half of 1991 instead of fall 
1990 to spring 1991 
the electricity privatization which is expected to raise 
anywhere between 24 billion and 44 billion faces strong 
opposition from the labor party and other government critics who 
believe the utility should remain in state hands 
the government also is in the process of selling off the water 
industry 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government has 
sold off billions of dollars of stateowned companies to the public 
in the past decade to promote capitalism in britain

hoylake investments ltd let its 22 billion offer 
for bat industries plc lapse friday as expected while it sought 
regulatory approval in the united states for the hostile bid 
hoylake an investor group led by financier sir james goldsmith 
took the step after a committee of britains panel on takeovers and 
mergers upheld a decision giving hoylake more time to pursue its 
takeover attempt 
a bidder in britain usually is given 90 days to win control of 
its target if it fails it must wait a year before bidding again 
hoylake which must win permission from us state insurance 
commissioners before it can acquire bats farmers insurance group 
inc was not expected to meet the deadline hoylake launched its 
bid on june 11 the offer was scheduled to expire oct 7 
the takeovers panel decided earlier this month that hoylake 
could bid again for bat within 21 days of obtaining us regulatory 
approval 
bat had argued to the appeals committee that allowing hoylake 
more time would place it under siege but the panel found in favor 
of the investor group 
the conglomerate responded to todays decision by noting that 
while hoylake was 11 weeks into its bid only a minuscule 
number of shareholders have accepted the offer 
bat stock rose 2 pence or 3 cents a share to close at 820 
pence or 1337 a share on londons stock exchange after the 
decision was announced 
hoylake offered 878 pence or 1431 worth of securities for 
each bat share on july 11 the offer totaled 1341 billion pounds 
or 22 billion and if successful would be the secondlargest 
takeover in the world behind the 2453 billion buyout of rjr 
nabisco inc earlier this year 
goldsmiths group has control of 23 percent of bats shares 
hoylakes banker hambros bank ltd said friday 
hambros said the bid had been accepted by shareholders 
representing 005 percent of bats stock hoylake and related 
parties own about 226 percent outright 
bat said friday after the panel announced its decision that the 
conglomerates shareholders have shown quite clearly that 
hoylakes proposals are wholly unacceptable 
securities analysts have said hoylake must put at least some 
cash into its offer for the deal to succeed 
in an effort to speed approval of its bid in the united states 
hoylake announced last month it would sell farmers to the french 
insurance company axa midi assurances which already does business 
in several states 
to this end hoylake and its advisers are in discussion with 
axa midi and its advisers to coordinate their activities in the 
us in the most efficient manner hoylake said friday 
on tuesday bat announced a major restructuring designed to fend 
off bats bid 
bat said it would pare its operations into two core areas of 
financial services and tobacco through the sale and spinoffs of its 
retail and paper businesses bats shareholders are to vote on 
these proposals on oct 19 
the conglomerates us retail operations which are being put 
on the block include saks fifth avenue and marshall fields

wheat futures prices closed sharply higher friday 
on the chicago board of trade following an agriculture department 
report that indicated us wheat supplies were smaller than traders 
had expected 
corn and soybean futures finished modestly lower partly on 
harvest pressure and partly in reaction to the usdas report of 
largerthanexpected stocks of those commodities 
in a report released after the close of trading thursday the 
usda projected wheat stocks for june 1 1990 at 191 billion 
bushels essentially unchanged from a year ago compared to trade 
estimates averaging 199 billion 
corn stocks as of sept 1 were estimated at 193 billion bushels 
compared to trade estimates averaging 189 billion and yearago 
stocks of 426 billion 
the usda estimated soybean stocks as of sept 1 at 182 million 
bushels compared to trade estimates averaging 159 million and 
yearago stocks of 302 million 
traders said a surge in in export sales of us grains during 
the week also helped boost wheat futures and limited losses in the 
corn and soybean markets 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 7 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 406 a bushel corn was 
1 cents lower to cent higher with december at 233 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 143 a 
bushel soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents lower with november at 
568 a bushel

ferranti international signal plc said friday it 
would reduce its asset value about 300 million after a preliminary 
investigation into accounting irregularities at a us subsidiary 
showed the defense company was defrauded 
in a letter to shareholders ferranti chairman derek alunjones 
said the company would have to reduce its net asset value by about 
302 million ferranti had net asset value of 451 million at the 
end of its last financial year 
alunjones said the reductions were forced by serious fraud 
in the reporting of nonexistent contracts at its international 
signal and control group plc unit at the time it bought the 
lancaster pabased company in 1987 
it is now clear that the price paid to the shareholders of isc 
was substantially inflated as a result of the fraud 
alunjones said 
ferranti bought the company for 685 million 
in the letter alunjones said the ferranti board was reviewing 
three options to inject new capital into the company a full 
takeover bid inviting an investor to buy a major stake in ferranti 
or issuing more shares to existing shareholders 
alunjones said ferranti has received shows of interests from a 
large number of british and foreign companies about the various 
options he did not elaborate 
ferranti also will forgo a final dividend payment for the year 
to last march 31 allowing the company to save 21 million he said 
to offset the asset writeoff alunjones said the ferranti 
board felt it would be necessary to raise at least 244 million in 
new equity the group has already outlined plans to reduce 
indebtedness by selling about 163 million of assets

bit by bit the onceimpenetrable chinese 
wall separating commercial banks from investment houses is 
crumbling 
the latest fissure came two weeks ago when bankers trust co of 
new york became the first bank to announce it will manage a public 
sale of corporate bonds 
until recent years banks were barred from most activities 
associated with the securities business such as selling stocks and 
corporate bonds under the depressionera glasssteagall act 
glasssteagall was partly prompted by the banks practice during 
the 1920s of helping companies sell stock or bonds to the public at 
inflated prices the companies would then use the proceeds to repay 
shaky loans to the banks 
the crash of 1929 made it harder for banks to dump unsound loans 
on stock and bond investors banks also lost money on underwritings 
that werent related to their own borrowers the result was a 
string of bank failures in the 1930s 
banks for many years have been permitted to sell lowrisk 
treasury bonds and generalobligation municipal bonds but the 
expanded powers granted in recent years allow banks to enter a 
world forbidden to them since 1933 by glasssteagall 
in 1987 the federal reserve board gave banks the authority to 
underwrite municipal revenue bonds commercial paper 
mortgagebacked securities and securities backed by consumer loans 
in january the fed gave preliminary approval for bankers trust 
and four other large banks to underwrite corporate bonds final 
approval was given over the summer 
the call by banks for the new powers was backed by the reagan 
and bush adminstrations which said they are needed to allow us 
banks to compete globally 
the new banking powers are strongly opposed by the securities 
industry association which represents the nations investment 
houses the group has a lawsuit pending that is intended to repeal 
the feds actions 
the trade group contends that banks may be endangering their 
depositors money which is federally insured by engaging in the 
risky practice of securities underwriting the group also argues 
that if changes need to be made to glasssteagall congress should 
do the changing not the fed 
a statute that everyone understood for almost 50 years has 
been literally gutted by regulators said don crawford a vice 
president of the trade group 
the feds actions also have a number of congressional critics 
after the fed gave its preliminary approval to bank bond 
underwriting rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committee compared it to inviting banks to 
shoot craps with the taxpayers money 
this is the kind of irresponsible behavior that gave us the 
savings and loan crisis and brought about the 1929 crash he said 
the fed placed a number of restrictions on the sale of bonds by 
banks one requires that this underwriting be done by separately 
capitalized subsidiaries so that deposits are not put at risk the 
fed also effectively restricted bond underwriting to the nations 
largest banks 
bankers trust announced last month that it will underwrite a 
150 million junk bond issue for morningstar foods inc of dallas 
a producer and distributor of dairy products 
some have questioned the wisdom of banks putting any of their 
capital at risk in the highrisk junk bond market the securities 
industry association speculates that the practice may lead congress 
to reexamine federal banking laws 
the american bankers association says such fears are unfounded 
theres proper safeguards said mary liz meany an aba 
spokeswoman referring to the feds restrictions on bank 
underwriting 
aba contends that the expanded banking powers are a necessary 
modernization of banking rules however the banking trade group 
agrees that congress not the fed should be making the changes 
the banks contend that the increased competition in bond 
underwriting they will bring to the market will make it cheaper for 
corporations to float new bond issues 
ultimately we expect to be a force in the bond 
marketplace said george fasel vice president of corporate 
communications for bankers trust 
the fed has indicated it will decide by early next year whether 
they also may also underwrite stock issues 
the brokerage firms contend that the eventual outcome of the 
expanded bank powers will be the destruction of the securities 
industry 
there will be no problem with a bank the size of citibank 
going out and buying merrill lynch crawford said 
he said that when canadas equivalent of glasssteagall was 
repealed a few years ago banks went on a buying spree today he 
said there are few brokerdealers in canada that arent owned by a 
bank

braniff inc on friday said that 2700 
employees laid off when the airline sought bankruptcy protection 
will not receive their last paychecks 
the orlando flabased airline also announced discount fares 
and a limited scheduled for next week 
braniff said workers who were not laid off after the airline 
filed for chapter 11 bankrptcy thursday for the second time in 
seven years will be paid possibly early next week the laidoff 
workers will not be paid 
there are a great many unhappy stories in a bankruptcy said 
don mcguire a spokesman for the airline at company headquarters in 
orlando fla 
i worked for a year to get this job six interviews said 
nancy mcelwee a flight attendant who was laid off and planned to 
return to her parents home in cocoa beach fla im not a happy 
camper right now i wanted to go home but not like this 
braniff meanwhile offered a discount fare of 49 to any of the 
cities the airline plans to serve next week the fares would be 
good for three days beginning monday 
braniff on friday operated flights to dallas orlando and los 
angeles on saturday braniff planned to add a flight to new york 
the airline next week plans to add roundtrip flights to 
washington dc chicago san francisco san diego and phoenix 
mcguire said a bankruptcy judge in orlando had authorized the 
airline to pay employees who continue to work and to give 
employees their sept 29 paycheck if they are recalled 
those laid off included pilots flight attendants mechanics and 
others a spokesman for missouri gov john ashcroft said about 
1900 workers including braniff employees and those in related 
industries would be affected in kansas city where braniff had 
been attempting to establish a hub 
braniff began canceling flights in kansas city wednesday 
afternoon and filed for bankruptcy at 130 am thursday the 
chapter 11 filing protects the airline from its creditors while it 
attempts to reorganize 
braniff had 93 flights out of kansas city and had planned to add 
eight flights sunday the airlines plans eventually called for 200 
flights daily and it was pressing the city for terminal 
improvements and construction of a maintenance base and a concourse 
for its commuter flights 
industry analysts said braniffs troubles began when it was 
forced to pay 32 million to acquire rights to gates at kansas city 
international airport from eastern airlines 
braniff moved in at kansas city after eastern bailed out of an 
attempt to establish a hub operation the airline apparently had 
thought kansas city could sell taxfree low interest bonds to 
finance the transaction but later learned that would be prohibited 
by state law 
a plan to borrow 75 million then unraveled they simply ran 
out of cash and had a payroll to meet said scott hamilton 
editor of commercial aviation week

threequarters of the way through 1989 many 
stockmarket investors are feeling prosperous and happy but 
reluctant to press their luck 
if the market can hang on over the next three months to the 
gains it has racked up so far it will chalk up the eighth 
consecutive yearly gain for the standard amp poors 500stock 
composite index the yardstick most wall street professionals use 
to measure their performance 
thats a long winning streak by any standard and veteran stock 
traders have long since schooled themselves that no rally lasts 
forever 
yet stirrings already are being heard in the financial world of 
optimistic talk about the outlook for 1990 and perhaps beyond 
after rising with only a few brief interruptions through the 
first eight months of the year hitting a record high on sept 1 
stocks have since backtracked a bit 
there were a few unsettling days in the market for junk bond 
takeover debt after it became evident that campeau corp of toronto 
was having trouble digesting the retailing empire it had amassed in 
the united states 
at the same time analysts said money managers at investing 
institutions were toting up the gains they had achieved since new 
years and looking for ways to protect those profits from any 
reversal in the markets course 
it appears that many many money managers have decided not to 
play for fear of messing up a great year observed jay donnaruma 
an analyst at first albany corp in albany ny 
during this recent sideways movement volume has contracted 
considerably noted william lefevre strategist at advest inc 
much of current volume is programrelated usually done by and 
for the brokerage houses themselves 
so one might conclude the public institutional and 
individual is just sitting there on the sidelines 
what both the stock and bond markets await is some sort of 
trigger device to get things off dead center that trigger device 
could be a resumption of interest rate cuts 
if interest rates are indeed headed lower they ran into an 
obstacle this past week in the form of downward pressure on the 
dollar in foreign exchange 
but the stock market managed to post some modest gains the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 269282 up 1121 
from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 124 to 19397 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
521 to 47328 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 738 at 38876 
volume on the big board averaged 15148 million shares a day 
against 13909 million the week before 
for the first nine months of the year the dow jones industrials 
show a net gain of 53425 points or 2464 percent 
many investors portfolios have performed better this year 
than they anticipated given their fairly meager expectations at 
the start of the year said greg smith at prudentialbache 
securities 
those investors are becoming very cautious about doing 
anything for the remainder of the year lest they give those 
windfall gains away unless some outside catalyst forces people to 
become more aggressive in the marketplace we face a fairly 
uneventful finish to this year 
however smith adds looking ahead to 1990 i expect a fairly 
bright intermediate to longterm environment this is the time of 
year when we have come to expect all those forecasts of an imminent 
recession to be shoved out another 12 months or so 
with that change in economic assumption more investors should 
feel comfortable with the equity market

we have no comment on this because there is nothing said about 
what reports are involved and why they are asking for the 
investigation said roger may director of corporate relations 
for dow jones amp co in new york 
all we know is the report weve seen that theyve asked the 
nyse and the sec to investigate its a little hard to respond to 
the higher stock price according to industry and securities 
analysts resulted partly from rumors that an amr takeover bid was 
imminent with new york developer donald trump a possible bidder 
for the company 
on thursday a stock arbitrageur told dow jones news service 
that the donald trump rumor is all over the place 
a rumor also surfaced thursday that amr managers could be 
considering an employee stock ownership plan that would place a 
small amount of company stock possibly 15 to 20 percent in the 
hands of airline workers 
that amount of stock though less than a controlling interest 
could be big enough to hinder an unsolicited takeover bid a source 
told the dallas morning news 
on wednesday speculation surfaced that amr stock was on the 
restricted list of goldman sachs amp co which would mean the 
investment banking firm would refrain from making recommendations 
to buy or sell amr shares 
according to the dow jones news service traders said this 
signaled the possibility that a defensive restructuring or a 
takeover deal could occur soon 
a managementled buyout with participation from the amr pilots 
union and investors sid and lee bass of fort worth was the subject 
of another rumor

stephen m wolf the chairman of ual corp is 
widely touted as the whiz kid of the nations airline industry 
and a highly capable manager 
but the 48yearold wolf faces a daunting test in pulling off 
the proposed pilotmanagement buyout of united airlines parent 
the ambitious takeover from which wolf stands to make 767 
million from his ual stock and options could be dashed by 
government regulators worried about airline competition 
wolf who left cargo carrier tiger international inc in 
december 1987 to head ual then called allegis corp had earned a 
reputation for turning troubled companies around some people call 
him the lee iacocca of the airline industry 
the lanky 6foot7 wolf built his career by jumping from job 
to job the way a commuter carrier hops from one town to another 
after working 15 years at american airlines he did much shorter 
stints as president of continental airlines marketing chief at pan 
american world airways head of nowdefunct republic airlines then 
chairman of tiger 
raised in a workingclass family in oakland calif wolf 
unloaded boxcars at an auto factory and worked on the oakland docks 
before graduating from san francisco state university in 1965 with 
a degree in sociology he then started at american airlines 
unlike some of the companies where he had worked allegis was 
basically a healthy enterprise when wolf arrived on the scene 
still it was a slumbering giant in the throes of a wrenching 
restructuring that included sales of its nonairline assets the 
hilton international and westin hotel chains and the hertz rental 
car company 
since then chicagobased ual has cut costs and expanded its 
fleet and wolfs already strong reputation has been enhanced in 
an industry racked by labor disputes and the rigors of competition 
wolf and american airlines boss robert crandall have emerged as the 
most respected us airline executives 
i think theres a lot of faith in wolf said edward 
starkman an airline analyst at painewebber inc hes got very 
good people skills 
those skills are being tested to the limit by the 675 billion 
takeover gambit led by wolf and other top ual managers allied with 
the companys 7000 pilots and british airways plc the buyout 
would create the biggest employeeowned company in the nation with 
workers holding 75 percent of ual in exchange for wage and benefit 
concessions 
wolf who would remain as head of the company already has 
flexed his leadership muscle in lining up bank financing for the 
300ashare deal 
what worries partisans of the buyout though is scrutiny by the 
government which has been making increasingly loud noises about 
takeovers of big us airlines the debt they pile up and the 
foreign partners they bring in 
last monday the transportation department gave wolf until oct 
10 to furnish information on investors and financial arrangements 
in the ual buyout plan with a view to determining how much foreign 
influence over the airline the takeover would allow 
under the proposal british airways would hold 15 percent of ual 
in exchange for a 750 million investment while wolfs management 
group would own the remaining 10 percent 
many analysts and investors fear the government might impose the 
same limitation on british airways role that it did on klm royal 
dutch airlines the foreign partner in the recent 365 billion 
buyout of northwest airlines parent nwa inc 
transportation secretary samuel skinner and nwas new principal 
owner investor alfred checchi announced friday that klm would 
reduce its interest in the deal in compliance with skinners 
request 
wolf issued a statement late friday saying he was confident 
the ual buyout plan would pass muster with the government 
the action taken today by the department of transportation 
indicates that secretary skinner is carefully examining each 
transaction on its own facts wolf said 
but if wolfs deal is subjected to similar scrutiny that 
could make the deal fall apart warned raymond neidl an analyst 
at investment firm dillon read amp co inc 
if the british airlines equity contribution were reduced the 
buyout might have to be restructured at a lower price or postponed 
he suggested 
that wariness has been manifest on wall street recently after a 
dizzying runup ual shares last week were trading below the 300 
offered by the wolf group 
there are other potential obstacles the machinists the largest 
union at united have so far refused to participate in the buyout 
which would require them to join the pilots in making wage 
concessions 
the machinists are expected to ask ual soon to negotiate a new 
labor contract and the union could use the issue of its 
participation as a bargaining chip in the talks 
analysts believe the pilotmanagement takeover could succeed 
without the machinists who have had a rocky relationship in recent 
years with the pilots at united 
in addition wolf has come under fire from the ual machinists 
and flight attendants for the estimated 767 million he stands to 
reap if the buyout succeeds 225 million for his 75000 ual 
shares and 5417 million for his options to buy another 250000 
shares 
he quickly countered that he is willing to work without a years 
salary and the golden parachute of severance pay 
wolf must be taking this rather personally said a former 
associate who asked not to be identified noting that the airline 
chief is concerned about impressions and likely was stung by the 
unions criticism 
if anyone can pull off the ambitious project its wolf 
analysts say 
i think the deal probably will go through neidl said 
steve wolf is very important as part of this deal

washington apple growers made a record 
4936 million in 1988 despite the alar scare but with the help of 
a federal bailout the washington department of agriculture 
reported 
the income was about 100 million below the departments 
projections for the year which likely reflects the impact of alar 
department spokeswoman mary beth lang said thursday 
after the alar scare and late in the season the us department 
of agriculture created a 95 million emergency bailout program to 
distribute stockpiled apples to the poor as a way to reduce 
supplies 
the 1988 income reflects the socalled farm gate value of 
apples which is what farmers receive it does not represent the 
value produced by the states extensive apple processing plants 
which turn out juice apple sauce and other products 
washingtons 4500 growers produce about half the nations 
apples 
the 1988 production value for growers jumped 42 percent over a 
1987 crop that was worth just 312 million the 1987 crop was 
plagued by poor weather and poor quality that depressed prices for 
the entire year said charles st john spokesman for the 
washington apple commission 
the 1988 value was also higher than the 1986 value of 488 
million the previous record 
the alar scare began in late february 1988 when a private 
consumer group issued a report warning that eating apples treated 
with the growth regulator increased cancer risk in children 
although the reports findings were hotly disputed wholesale 
prices plunged 50 percent and sales also dropped 
prior to the alar scare growers were enjoying an outstanding 
year and the agriculture department on march 1 projected apple 
growers would make 588 million for the year ms lang said the 
actual income was 95 million less she said 
st john said the 1988 record income illustrates how the alar 
scare primarily hurt sales of red delicious apples which make up 
69 percent of the states crop alar is primarily used on red 
apples 
prices have begun dropping again in recent weeks as the 1989 
crop is harvested and shipped to market a state department of 
agriculture survey concluded earlier this week that no alar was 
used on the 1989 crop

rambo is a favorite video rental in beirut 
filipinos wear ghostbusters tshirts jerry lewis is a cultural 
hero in france 
us industry may be choking but american cultural imperialism 
seems to be growing ever stronger as sony corps foray into 
hollywood this past week showed 
sony agreed to buy columbia pictures entertainment inc and an 
independent production company for a total of 36 billion because 
it wanted the best in the world and the best in the world in film 
and television is american 
hollywood studios are in many ways the opposite of japanese 
manufacturers yet they have discovered their own way to succeed in 
the global marketplace 
japanese companies excel at churning out millions of perfectly 
identical gadgets at the lowest possible price american studios 
release a handful of motion pictures a year each one different 
from the last and spend extravagantly on each one 
japanese companies study each step they take at length 
hollywood wheelerdealers make deals over spritzers while doing 
lunch 
where japanese companies employ people for life hollywood 
studios fire chief executives routinely the best people in 
hollywood operate with a freedom that is unheard of in japan 
many business advice books tell american chief executives to 
make their companies more like the japanese maybe though the 
answer is to be more like hollywood 
hollywood with all its peculiar personalities may be a model 
for the rest of american business for the 1990s argues howard 
suber cochairman of the film producers program at the university 
of california at los angeles 
hollywood works because its best people the ones who fight to 
the top know how to spot a trend and make money on it before other 
people even see it coming suber said that is a skill other 
american businesses could stand to learn 
people who are capable of turning on a dime have an 
evolutionary advantage over dinosaurs who need six blocks to turn 
right suber said 
subers fellow chairman in the ucla program is none other than 
peter guber the whirlwind hollywood lawyer and dealmaker who is 
widely expected to be named by sony as the new chief of columbia 
pictures 
suber said he is convinced that if guber takes the job it will 
be with complete artistic control probably more than he would get 
if columbia were owned by an american company 
peter guber has an absolute genius for perceiving value before 
anybody else does suber said sony knows that any meddling would 
kill the golden goose for sure he added 
sony says the same thing noting that it has kept its hands off 
the management of cbs records after buying it for 2 billion 
japans esprit de corps comes from cultural and ethnic sameness 
hollywoods comes from the sharing of a dream to make a big movie 
and get rich that is shared by people who flock from around the 
world 
in contrast to the image of poolside loungers hollywood is as 
hectic and competitive as wall street or chicagos lasalle street 
the ucla film program accepts only about 7 percent of its 
applicants making it harder to get into than medical school even 
those who get in have only a small chance of striking it rich 
in the darwinian world of film and television hundreds of 
projects die without being seen by a single viewer a property that 
looked hot goes cold by the time the movie is made or a script 
doesnt quite come together 
the challenges of the unknown that hollywood has learned to cope 
with are becoming familiar to makers of computers and corn flakes 
as competition keeps getting tougher people who delay decisions 
until everything is certain will fall behind 
youve got to have people who have an enormously high 
tolerance for ambiguity suber said 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the dollar plunged sharply against major foreign currencies 
with a strong push from the central banks of the group of seven 
industrialized democracies the group of seven acted after agreeing 
last weekend in washington that the dollar had risen too much in 
recent months endangering the improvement in the us trade 
balance 
the house agreed to cut the capital gains tax rejecting an 
alternative proposal backed by democratic leaders the taxcutting 
measure supported by president bush faces a fight in the senate 
democrat leaders said the cut would help mainly rich people while 
republicans said it would promote investment and make the economy 
stronger 
braniff inc put itself under bankruptcy court protection for 
the second time in seven years the airline filed its petition 
hours after canceling flights sending workers home and leaving 
travelers stranded in airports the carrier shrunken since its 
first trip through bankruptcy court ranks 13th in size in the 
united states elsewhere in the airline business the buyers of 
northwest airlines agreed to restrict the participation of klm 
royal dutch airlines in compliance with a government request

billionplus company which has been my first love after my family

wheat futures prices climbed to threemonth highs friday on the 
chicago board of trade following an agriculture department report 
indicating us wheat stocks were about 80 million bushels below 
market expectations 
on other commodity markets corn and soybean futures retreated 
livestock and meat futures were mixed energy futures were mostly 
higher and precious metals declined 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 7 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 407 a bushel the highest 
settlement for a nearmonth wheat contract since june 30 
corn was 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with december at 
233 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with december 
at 144 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 4 cents lower with 
november at 568 a bushel 
in a report released after the close of trading thursday the 
usda projected wheat stocks for june 1 1990 at 191 billion 
bushels compared to trade estimates averaging 199 billion 
corn stocks as of sept 1 were estimated at 193 billion bushels 
compared to trade estimates averaging 189 billion and the usda 
estimated soybean stocks as of sept 1 at 182 million bushels 
compared to trade estimates averaging 159 million 
the usda report provided the main support for the wheat market 
but traders said a surge in in export sales of us grains during 
the week also helped boost wheat futures and limited losses in the 
corn and soybean markets 
all things considered i think the market acted real good 
said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
the usda announced after the close that it had accepted bids 
from exporters to cover the sale of 270000 metric tons of wheat to 
china at subsidized prices and market analysts said egypt was 
seeking to buy 500000 metric tons of us wheat 
the usda also announced that 150000 metric tons of corn had 
been sold to unknown destinations which is often interpreted as a 
sale to the soviet union 
rumors that the soviets were seeking to buy us corn had given 
corn futures a lift on thursday 
livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the chicago 
mercantile exchange ahead of the usdas quarterly hogsandpigs 
report which estimated the us swine herd as of sept 1 at 584 
million head about the same as last year and very close to market 
expectations 
but analysts said nearterm hog futures may open lower monday in 
reaction to another section of the report that showed pork 
producers had kept slightly more hogs for marketing than traders 
had expected 
the hog report was perceived as slightly bullish for the 
deferred contracts though because it indicated pork producers had 
backed off a bit on their fall breeding intentions which would 
imply a smaller supply of hogs next spring and summer 
for the short term the report was a little tinge negative 
for the long term bullish said chuck levitt senior livestock 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
live cattle settled 45 cent lower to 03 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in october at 7192 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 40 cent lower to 15 cent higher with october at 8295 
cents a pound hogs were 10 cent lower to 38 cent higher with 
october at 4380 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 28 cent 
to 68 cent lower with february at 4822 cents a pound 
most energy futures prices rose on the new york mercantile 
exchange as traders were encouraged by opecs ability to reach an 
agreement to limit production 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents lower to 27 
cents higher with november at 2013 a barrel heating oil was 43 
cent to 77 cent higher with october at 5944 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 53 cent lower to 65 cent higher with 
october at 6040 cents a gallon 
gold and silver futures fell moderately on new yorks commodity 
exchange despite a drop in the dollar amid preweekend 
profittaking 
gold futures ended 30 cents to 90 cents lower with october at 
36720 a troy ounce silver was 37 cents to 4 cents lower with 
october at 5226 a troy ounce

harcourt brace jovanovich inc stock plunged friday 
amid warnings that the 11 billion paid for its theme parks would 
do little to relieve the publishers debt 
harcourts stock price dropped more than 25 percent on the new 
york stock exchange falling 412 a share to 1212 
the orlandobased textbook publisher took on 29 billion in 
debt to fend off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt by british 
communications mogul robert maxwell and analysts say it now finds 
itself squeezed to pay off the interest 
analysts had hoped orlandobased harcourt would get 15 billion 
to 2 billion for the four sea world and two other parks it sold to 
anheuserbusch cos inc on thursday 
the 11 billion sale price will net harcourt about 930 million 
i think peoples expectations were too high for the selling 
price of the theme parks brown brothers harriman amp co analyst 
robert dunlap said 
when harcourt first announced the intended sale the companys 
stock soared from 10 to 18 
dunlap said the sale would lower harcourts 3466 million in 
annual interest payments by 115 million 
but the loss of the parks will cut into the income harcourt 
needs to pay the debts as of june 30 the parks accounted for 
683 million of the companys 2168 million in annual earnings 
and that share had been expected to increase 
they dont have enough money to pay the interest dunlap 
said he said harcourt needs to reduce annual interest payments to 
under 150 million either by lowering payments another 80 
million or selling assets of 800 million 
dunlap speculated that harcourt could sell its insurance arm 
but other analysts said even that will not be enough 
they dont have that much more to sell ultimately they will 
have to issue more equity says bert boksen of raymond james amp 
associates inc in st petersburg 
that will help reduce the debt but will dilute share values even 
further he said 
were still recommending selling the stock boksen said 
we think its worth somewhere near 8 to 9 a share 
he said harcourts breakup value is about 14 a share and stock 
in publishers should sell at about 60 percent of that price 
boksen added that more bad news may be in store for harcourt 
noting that school publishing sales for all publishers were soft in 
the third quarter 
harcourt officials did not return telephone calls seeking 
comment 
harcourts popular sea world parks which feature performing 
killer whales such as shamu trained dolphins and other talented 
creatures from the sea are located in san diego orlando san 
antonio and aurora ohio 
the other parks involved in the deal are boardwalk and baseball 
in orlando and cypress gardens in winter haven the purchase also 
includes land adjacent to the three florida parks sea world of 
texas and orlando international airport 
overall attendance at the six parks was 145 million last year 
prior to the theme park deal harcourt had annual sales of 15 
billion with the parks accounting for 388 million the company 
employed 17500 people before the sale

the interstate commerce commission on friday 
approved the proposed sale of the chicago missouri amp western 
railway line between chicago and east st louis a major step in 
the carriers reorganization 
the deal which still must be approved by a us bankruptcy 
judge in chicago would give the route to rio grande industries 
inc a railroad company in san francisco that has been seeking a 
foothold in illinois 
under the proposal rio grande would pay 22 million and assume 
7 million of cmampw debt owed to various state agencies rio grande 
told the government it would eliminate 187 of the 360 cmampw jobs on 
the line 
whatever happens in bankruptcy court will probably happen soon 
because cmampw is in a tough cash position said george w mayo 
jr attorney for rio grande 
the route is used mainly for freight but amtrak also uses it to 
run three daily roundtrip runs between chicago and st louis and 
two between chicago and springfield 
in making its decision the icc considered objections from 
competing railroads including chicago and north western 
transportation co and illinois central railroad co 
both handle freight for railroads owned by rio grande business 
they are likely to lose if the deal is approved in bankruptcy court 
and rio grande gains access to the line illinois central said it 
would lose 72 million per year 
the icc was not swayed 
we conclude that the acquisition of cmampws line will 
not result in a substantial lessening of competition creation of a 
monopoly or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in 
the region the order said 
the transfer will also assure continued operation by amtrak 
over its third heaviest volume line the state has made a 
substantial investment in the line the icc said sale to rio 
grande will secure this investment 
under the proposed deal with rio grande cmampw would still retain 
its kansas city moeast st louis route track between greene 
county and springfield a 50 percent interest in the godfreyeast 
st louis line and all locomotives and cars 
cmampw was created in 1986 to be an independent regional railroad 
in april 1988 the railroad filed for bankruptcy reorganization and 
the case is pending before us bankruptcy court judge john 
schwartz in chicago 
creditors primarily citicorp north america inc and heller 
financial inc are owed more than 100 million they want 
immediate liquidation of the railroad while daniel murray the 
courtappointed trustee supports the rio grande deal 
neal wolf an attorney representing citicorp and murray could 
not be reached for comment friday on the icc decision 
cmampw is wrangling with its creditors over 139 million in loans 
and grants given to the railroad by the state of illinois 
us district judge marvin aspen prevented cmampw from using the 
money but that ruling has been appealed to a higher court
