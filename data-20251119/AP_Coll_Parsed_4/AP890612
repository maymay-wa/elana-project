a us district judge monday barred the state 
from enforcing its yearold antiobscenity law saying the language 
of the statute was unconstitutionally vague 
wisconsin attorney general don hanaway said he would appeal judge 
jp statmuellers ruling to the us circuit court of appeals in 
chicago 
hanaway said he had not seen the decision granting a preliminary 
injunction but he understood the judge ruled it was unclear whether 
the law applied to simulated or actual sexual conduct this was 
not a major issue in the appeal by opponents of the law hanaway 
said 
were going to have an obscenity law that is going to be 
constitutional hanaway said i think it would be wrong for 
people to spend a bunch of money to reopen 
hanaway said he understood some stores had closed following last 
junes enactment of the law which was intended to halt commercial 
traffic in hardcore pornography 
two milwaukee stores denmark book store and paradise video 
store and the pure pleasure ii bookstore in oshkosh filed the 
lawsuit against the state calling the obscenity statute 
unconstitutional 
prosecutors have held off enforcing the law while they awaiting 
statmuellers ruling the law calls for jail terms of up to five 
years and fines of up to 10000 for pornography wholesalers 
under the statute material is obscene if it lacks serious 
literary artistic political educational or scientific value 
stephen m glynn the attorney representing the stores called 
the decision wellreasoned and said were very pleased by it 
but a sponsor of the legislation sen joseph andrea said he was 
disappointed by stadtmuellers decision 
he and sen water j chilsen were very careful when we put this 
the law together to address the constitutional concerns andrea 
said chilsen was the chief sponsor of the bill 
stadtmueller said the law was unconstitutionally vague among 
other issues the judge said it was difficult to determine whether 
the law was violated by pictures or by descriptions of sexually 
explicit conduct or by both 
in addition stadtmueller said the state violated the equal 
protection clause of the constitution by exempting libraries 
schools and universities from prosecution under the statute 
the law would allow a library to commercially distribute obscene 
materials without the threat of prosecution but does not allow an 
adult bookstore to do the same the judge said

a man who held a knife to the throat of 
boston red sox third baseman wade boggs outside a bar was sentenced 
monday to 25 years in prison 
george young jr 23 pleaded no contest to two charges of 
aggravated battery and one count of burglary in the dec 28 
incident which left boggs with a slight cut on his neck a 
nocontest plea is not an admission of guilt but can be used as such 
for the purpose of sentencing 
under sentencing guidelines young faced three years in prison 
but because he had been out of prison less than three months 
before the december attacks assistant state attorney ralph grabel 
asked acting circuit judge j edward philman to use state law to go 
well above the recommended sentence 
philman said his sentence was based more on the violence of the 
crime than the stature of boggs an allstar third baseman and one 
of baseballs top hitters 
the fact that he had been released so recently on a violent 
crime and then went out and committed another even more violent 
crime i determined him to be a danger to society philman said 
after the sentencing 
young fell well within the the requirements for an extended 
sentence since he had been released in september from prison on a 
1985 conviction of aggravated battery with a firearm and a later 
escape charge grabel said 
philman sentenced young to 15 years on the aggravated battery of 
boggs and another 10 years in prison for the assault on stephen 
minardi a passenger in boggs jeep who attempted to help the 
athlete 
the judge ordered young to serve an additional five years on 
probation for a burglary charge related to entering boggs jeep 
during the assault 
according to police reports of the incident boggs was inside his 
vehicle showing his friends a handgun when young and another man 
began talking to boggs 
the men left but a short time later pulled up in a vehicle and 
parked in front of boggs jeep blocking him when a passenger in 
boggs vehicle got out to talk to the men young brandished a knife 
police say young got into boggs vehicle holding the knife to 
the baseball players throat while threatening to kill him

one problem alabama shared with other states was allowing doctors 
to practice on inmates even when not licensed to treat the public 
it was the first state to hire a private company that used fully 
licensed doctors to provide medical care in its prisons now all or 
part of care in 29 states comes from private providers 
the norm 15 years ago was a brokendown doctor with an 
institutional license someone who couldnt practice on the outside 
because he was too old too sick or an alcoholic said dr jay 
anno of the national commission on correctional health care 
about the same time the courts began correcting ills health 
groups were seeking reform reacting to conditions exposed by 
several prison disorders including the 1971 riot at attica ny 
what evolved was the national commission on correctional health 
care which determined 71 minimum things prisons should provide 
about 60 prisons have met the standards since 1982 
the guidelines include medical screening of all incoming inmates 
daily access to sick call 24hour nursing care for inpatients and 
requiring uniform licensing and regulation of doctors nurses and 
other staff 
while most states now assure their prison physicians are properly 
licensed problems with doctors persist 
in the hiring competition many prisons turn to doctors from 
foreign medical schools who struggle with english 
that doesnt necessarily mean theyre quacks their english is 
terrible and they have a hard time communicating said william 
rold of the prisoners rights project in new york 
doctors in prison may also be treating ailments for which they 
have no training in the 1970s a gynecologist did dental exams at 
bedford hills the prisoners rights project said in another new 
york prison a pathologist practiced general medicine and a 
pediatrician served as an internist 
salaries are one of the biggest barriers to attracting doctors 
hawaii for example pays prison doctors 35000 a year about 
half what they could earn outside onethird of the nursing slots in 
hawaiis prisons are unfilled 
what doctor in his right mind would want to practice medicine 
for civilservice pay under harsh conditions for a group of patients 
that doesnt like or trust him said curtis prout director of the 
internship program at harvard medical school 
added dr ronald shansky medical director of the illinois prison 
system no one goes to medical school and says boy when i get 
out im going to go to a prison and make my mark

it was bad enough antti haavisto coughed 
up blood in his prison cell all night he also had to listen to 
death threats from neighboring inmates kept sleepless by the 
diseased mans ceaseless hacking 
hurry up and die convicts snarled through the steel bars 
inside stillwater prison in eastern minnesota shut up or well 
shut you up 
haavistos lungs were being consumed by tuberculosis which 
remained undiagnosed through 11 visits to sick call over six months 
in 1982 prison doctors failed to spot the tb on two xrays 
although haavisto was coughing up sputum with the consistency of 
sludge the doctors told him he had emphysema or pneumonia and gave 
him cough drops to ease the hacking 
i thought i was going to die i couldnt get air in and i 
couldnt cough that mud out i almost drowned twice said the 
wheezing haavisto a finnish immigrant convicted of manslaughter 
before id go to eat i tried to cough up enough stuff so i 
didnt bother anyone i was afraid they would hate me and beat me 
up haavisto 64 said in an interview 
even after haavisto was diagnosed and released from prison in may 
1983 the airborne germ stalked the stillwater cellblocks 
one year after haavistos diagnosis the prisoner in the next 
cell came down with tb an outbreak occurred in 1984 when inmates 
sued the prison for deficient medical care and another rash of 
infections hit in 1986 when the entire prison was finally tested 
ultimately onethird of the 1200 inmates and at least five 
guards were infected 
tuberculosis is a bacterial lung disease once known as 
consumption because it eats away lung tissue scientists estimate 10 
million americans are infected but the vast majority will never get 
the disease 
tb is far worse in crowded prisons lawyers and inmate advocates 
say tb outbreaks show what can happen when a contagious disease 
infects a closed environment with antiquated ventilation systems and 
inattentive medical watchdogs 
the incidence of tb among prisoners is more than triple the rate 
of those not in jail according to a may report by the federal 
centers for disease control in new jersey the rate is 11 times 
higher for inmates in california six times higher new york 
prisons had a sevenfold increase in the disease in the 10year 
period ending in 1986 
the cdc recommended these corrective measures for prisons tb 
tests at least once a year quick xrays for inmates showing 
symptoms and isolation of those infected 
in minnesota federal judge diana murphy said the handling of the 
epidemic by prison officials and the state department of health 
evidenced a lack of care or reckless disregard for the medical 
needs of inmates 
in january five years after the lawsuit was filed she ruled 
that conditions had improved and there was no need to order 
corrective actions 
nevertheless she severely criticized prison administrators 
saying they passed off responsibility to department of health 
which assigned reponsibility to the doctors who denied any role in 
managing the crisis other than providing primary care 
it was a shocking case of negligence said stephen miles of 
the university of chicagos center for clinical medical ethics 
prisoners were not only incarcerated but negligently exposed to a 
contagious disease 
the prison became a pest hole of tuberculosis infection not 
only was there neglect prison officials turned a blind eye to known 
facts there was recklessness said arlo vandevegte attorney for 
the inmates who sued the state 
haavisto apparently brought the tb with him into stillwater on 
his trips to sick call he even suggested the medical staff check 
for tb 
i told them i think i got some real bad problem i couldnt 
talk i couldnt even make a phone call it was so bad haavisto 
said i said i got to get out of this hole or im going to die in 
here 
inmate tony degidio contracted tb during the epidemic his father 
caught it when he came to the prison to visit tony 
youre trapped you dont have a way out degidio said we 
used to tell the guards to do something this guys got a problem 
treat it or were going to treat it our way eliminate him 
prison officials say treatment and tracking have improved 
we dont have those problems now said leroy siegel 
executive assistant to stillwaters warden we responded the way 
the socalled experts told us to

to the united states the panama 
canal is a marvel of american knowhow a symbol of the strength and 
ingenuity that made it a power 
to a generation of panamanians the canal is merely emblematic of 
american domination 
the canal has been a curse for panama said maj edgardo 
lopez a spokesman for the panamanian defense forces sometimes i 
think we would have been better off barefoot eating bananas but 
without this canal 
in 1978 the united states finally agreed to turn over the canal 
zone and its military installations to panama by 1999 meanwhile 
the panamanians will assume greater administrative control 
for latin americans the agreement was one of the most 
significant developments of the century and the centerpiece of a 
more open us policy in the region 
the violation of that accord would create a grave crisis 
said venezuelan president carlos andres perez even though he is no 
friend of gen manuel antonio noriega the president has backed the 
us effort to oust noriega panamas defense forces commander and 
de facto ruler 
the controversy over canal dates back to the founding of panama 
in 1903 when panamanians accepted a treaty that gave the united 
states permanent rights to a zone 10 miles wide across the center of 
panama 
in essence panama was exchanging the canal zone for help in 
gaining independence from colombia at the time it seemed worth the 
trade 
secretary of state john hay wrote a friend at the time that the 
treaty was vastly advantageous to the united states according 
to david mcculloughs book the path between the seas 
panamanian objections were outweighed by a desire to profit from 
the immense us construction effort that ended in 1914 according 
to materno vasquez an aide to former leader gen omar torrijos 
during the treaty negotiations 
vasquez said it was not until 1935 that nationalists began to 
refer to the canal zone as a colonialist enclave 
he said many panamanians resented the gold and silver 
canal payrolls the higher gold for americans and white 
panamanians the silver for darkskinned panamanians 
by 1964 resentment had festered to the point where it fueled 
riots that left 20 panamanians and four us soldiers dead 
vasquez said torrijos who controlled panama from 1968 until his 
death in 1981 viewed the effort to recover the zone as his 
generations historical mission 
in his book keeping faith jimmy carter who agreed as 
president to the 1978 pact said he felt the old arrangement was 
unjust and was driving a wedge between panama and the united states 
nevertheless carter said he did not understand the strength of 
panamanian feelings until torrijos reading a statement at the 
signing of the new pact broke down and sobbed 
in addition the canals strategic value has dropped because the 
us navy has grown and need not move as often between the oceans 
its economic importance has been diminished by air travel 
interstate highways and oil pipelines 
many americans however bitterly opposed the new agreement they 
saw the canal as vital to american security and some suggested 
panamanians would be unable to run it 
ronald reagan gave a lightning rod to opponents with the phrase 
we built it during his successful run for carters job in 1980 
the us senate ratified the new treaties in spring 1978 by 68 
votes only one more than the required twothirds majority 
the canal is now run by the panama canal commission with five 
us and four panamanian members though the administrator for this 
year is an american a panamanian is supposed to succeed him 
that may be a sticking point because the united states is 
unlikely to approve a noriega nominee the canal could be run 
temporarily by a us deputy administrator 
for his part noriega never loses a chance to say the united 
states wants to keep the canal however both his enemies and 
friends say he sincerely believes in a historical mission of taking 
over the canal 
in the united states ironically it is noriegas leadership that 
has given rise to new talk in congress and elsewhere about 
abrogating the canal agreements noriega has been indicted on us 
drugrunning charges and both the bush and reagan administrations 
have tried to pressure him out of office 
i think its inconceivable that the american people directly 
or through a marionette would allow noriega to appoint an 
administrator for the canal said rep newt gingrich rga in 
early may 
the united states moreover has military options it could use 
us troops who now number about 14000 would leave in 1999 under 
the treaties however congress says it has reserved the right to 
defend the canal with us soldiers if necessary 
the united states last flexed its muscles in may sending about 
2000 more combat troops to the canal after noriega voided a 
national election

vice president dan quayle said 
sunday he will tell contra commanders this week that if they want to 
lay down arms and return to nicaragua they should be encouraged 
to do so 
the vice president beginning a three day journey to four central 
american countries said however that he will present that only as 
one option the contras might choose as the united states and latin 
heads of state seek a diplomatic rather than military solution to 
the contra war against nicaraguas leftist government 
quayle also indicated he does not have much faith in nicaraguan 
president daniel ortegas promise to hold free elections next 
february as required by the regional peace plan but said e would 
not use those doubts to encourage the contras to hang on for the 
possibility of renewed us military aid 
asked by reporters aboard air force two en route from washington 
whether he would tell the contras to return to nicaragua to 
participate in the political process quayle said im not going to 
do that but im certainly going to lay that out as an option and 
if they feel comfortable they should be encouraged to go back 
he added i dont think it would be proper for me to say this is 
your only option 
quayle is scheduled to meet with a handful of contra field 
commanders on tuesday morning in honduras their 11000member force 
is camped out near the nicaraguan border supplied by us 
nonlethal aid 
quayle said he would underscore the need for the contras to 
refrain from military attacks during this period a condition of the 
us aid package 
he held out hope for fair elections in nicaragua but also voiced 
skepticism attacking ortega and accusing him of already violating 
terms of peace agreements of the contra commanders quayle said i 
dont have to tell them what danny ortegas track record is 
he mentioned specifically us allegations that nicaragua is 
arming leftist rebels in el salvador in violation of the regional 
peace accords 
quayle said the purpose of his trip to guatemala costa rica el 
salvador and honduras is threefold 
to emphasize the importance of democracy in the region 
to get involved on a substantive basis with the presidents 
of those us allies before they and ortega meet again in july to 
further work on their peace plan 
to find out what the presidents think they can to to help 
pressure panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega from power which 
is the bush administrations foremost goal in panama 
quayle was scheduled to meet monday morning with political and 
community leaders in guatemala before seeing president vinicio 
cerezo and then fly on to honduras 
cerezo told reporters last week he expected to discuss a variety 
of topics with quayle including us trade policies and economic 
and military aid the united states has important military and 
economic relationships with each of the countries quayle will visit 
cerezo specifically mentioned as topics of discussion 
us import quotas especially on textiles he said they would 
directly affect the small local textile industry the guatemalan 
government is encouraging 
faster disbursement of 80 million approved in balance of 
payments support for guatemala 
reservations from some congressional quarters about continued 
us military aid 
quayle will be in el salvador for less than a day at a time when 
the country is gripped by a new wave of violence in its nineyear 
civil war his trip is intended in large part to show support for 
the new government of rightist president alfredo cristiani who was 
inaugurated on june 1 
quayle met with cristiani when he was a candidate for president 
in early february and again when cristiani visited washington as 
presidentelect 
cristianis closest adviser cabinet minister jose antonio 
rodriquez porth was gunned down along with two bodyguards on friday 
in an attack cristiani blamed on leftist rebels 
quayle is to deliver the presidents condolences to the rodriquez 
porth family and cristiani 
despite concerns from some on capitol hill and other critics that 
the government of cristianis arena party will give rise to a new 
wave of death squad violence and human rights violations us 
officials have said cristiani deserves a chance to prove his 
prohuman rights statements

president bushs proposed savings and loan 
bailout plan moves to the house floor this week with members of his 
own party attacking its key reform and democrats trying to use it to 
create new housing subsidies 
with the sampl crisis already expected to cost taxpayers 600 to 
1000 for every man woman and child in the country what has been 
a largely harmonious effort so far could deteriorate into partisan 
namecalling 
omens of what might occur when debate begins wednesday were 
evident last week in several confrontations between democrats and 
republicans sun belt and frost belt lawmakers and populists and 
industry sympathizers 
rep dennis eckart dohio said what happens will be the first 
test of bipartisan cooperation since his party lost two of its three 
top leaders to ethics problems 
were fully cognizant that this is president bushs 
initiative he said however the republicans are more 
interested in weakening the presidents own bill we are not going 
to allow the republican congressional campaign committee to 
criticize democrats for trying to help a republican initiative 
the senate meanwhile is expected to spend most of the week 
debating a bill to lift the remaining government price controls on 
natural gas 
only about onethird of the nations supply of the fuel is still 
under the federal price ceilings experts generally agree that 
prices to consumers will not rise immediately from total decontrol 
because current market prices are well below the federal ceiling 
however many acknowledge that natural gas prices could rise in 
the 1990s as demand for it increases particularly if oil prices 
continue rising and new environmental controls are put on coal 
back in the house democrats this week hope to complete 
rebuilding the leadership ranks devastated by ethics questions that 
felled former speaker jim wright of texas and majority whip tony 
coelho of california 
with thomas s foley of washington now installed as speaker 
democrats on wednesday meet to fill the no 2 and no 3 party 
leadership slots in the house 
richard gephardt dmo and ed jenkins dga are vying for 
foleys old post of majority leader 
reps william h gray iii dpa beryl anthony dark and 
david bonior dmich are competing for the whips position which 
coelho will vacate upon the naming of a replacement 
wrights and coelhos downfall were due in part to charges they 
peddled their influence to sampl operators in opposing higher federal 
deposit insurance fees on the industry while raising campaign money 
for democratic candidates 
house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia threatened last week to 
use this weeks debate to talk about how the mess got so big and 
who was responsible after rep marcy kaptur dohio called bushs 
sampl plan the biggest tax increase in recent memory 
the biggest fight will be over new capital requirements for the 
industry republicans are resisting the key reform measure in bushs 
package a requirement that sampl owners put more of their own money 
at risk when making speculative loans 
democrats meanwhile want to make the thrift industry pay 75 
billion to 150 billion a year toward subsidizing belowmarket 
mortgage rates for lowincome homebuyers and rental housing 
they also differ with bush over the accounting for the bailout 
program the president has adamantly resisted allowing the sampl 
cleanup to show up in the federal deficit and thus bolster the case 
for a tax increase his proposal for getting around the problem is 
floating 50 billion in private bonds and obligating taxpayers to 
pay the 157 billion in interest costs on them over three decades 
democrats would finance the program through direct borrowing by 
the treasury in order to save some 45 billion through lower 
interest rates 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois concedes democrats 
will probably win that vote as well as the one on housing subsidies

with a sharp nononsense crack the gavel in 
the hand of chairman dante fascell hits the desk in the hearing room 
of the house foreign affairs committee 
displaying the bite bark and manner of a grizzled drill 
sergeant the florida democrat is whipping a twoyear 115 million 
foreign assistance bill into shape in long sessions that lasted for 
days 
attendance at meetings is heavy interest is apparently high 
shift the scene to the senate 
chairman claiborne pell dri enters the hearing room of the 
senate foreign relations committee promptly at 10 am and seats 
himself in the center of the horseshoeshaped bench 
the chairs to his right and left are empty 
but pell is determined to get to work on a bill authorizing 45 
billion in spending for the state department and its sister agencies 
pell the gracious selfeffacing possessor of a distinguished 
family heritage dating to colonial times waits patiently for absent 
senators to arrive 
nearly 50 minutes later he shrugs then gloomily announces the 
session cannot proceed for lack of a quorum 
there is he declares wryly a profound lack of interest in 
this bill 
the senate committee on foreign relations once pointed to as a 
summit of legislative prestige influence and power is caught in a 
state of inertia that borders at times on stalemate 
last week the committee floundered through a political dispute 
over a controversial ambassadorial appointment and finally 
surmounting a republican boycott of all its committee meetings 
approved the state department authorization bill 
but even that action left key spending decisions uncertain and 
unresolved 
donald gregg the nominee to be ambassador to south korea is the 
target of a democratic probe of allegations which he denies that 
he used a former position as national security adviser to vice 
president bush to help the illegal resupply of the nicaraguan contra 
rebels 
the gop boycott organized by sen mitch mcconnell rky was 
mounted in the conviction that democrats were attempting to stir 
anew the fading embers of the irancontra affair and sink the gregg 
nomination in a morass of delays and leaks 
mcconnell called off the boycott after sen alan cranston 
dcalif agreed to let the gregg nomination come to a vote on june 
20 
with the gridlock caused by the dispute over gregg cleared away 
the panel was able to consider and approve the state department bill 
but debate was muddied by a tug of war over two competing 
spending priorities the construction in israel of two expensive 
broadcasting transmitters for the voice of america a course 
favored by sen jesse helms rnc and the payment of millions of 
dollars of pastdue payments to the united nations a course favored 
by chairman pell 
the panel decided that the transmitters should be funded but that 
the money should not be taken out of the un account as helms had 
demanded no one said where the money would come from in a foreign 
affairs account that is already nearly 800 million over budget 
ceilings 
the committee tried to return to the larger and more potentially 
controversial foreign aid bill on friday 
but once again no quorum could be mustered 
the panel will try again this week 
many observers say that the panels strongest member is not its 
chairman but helms who as the ranking gop member is the architect 
of his own highly conservative highly anticommunist foreign policy 
pell has held firm against helms determined and imaginative 
tactics and the north carolinian has more than once growled dont 
you try to railroad me mr chairman 
helms fiercely opposed senate ratification of the ussoviet 
mediumrange missile treaty two years ago during the panels 
lengthy consideration of it senior democrats made sure one or all 
of them were present to rebut his assertions and attempt to overcome 
his tactics 
helms also has engaged in a longrunning battle with the state 
department drawing criticism for allegedly delaying diplomatic 
nominations in order to gain leverage in battles to shape foreign 
policy 
the committee many of its critics say has seen brighter days 
the names of such postwar chairman as arthur vandenburg of 
michigan j william fulbright of arkansas and frank church of idaho 
have been central to the shaping of american foreign policy 
the committees influence has been slipping since fulbrights 
chairmanship in the early 1970s with the exception of a brief 
renaissance when sen richard lugar rind headed the panel for 
two years beginning in 1985 
during the lugar years foreignaid legislation marched with 
unaccustomed ease through the congress a consensus was won on 
controversial sanctions against whiteruled south africa and lugar 
helped change us policy toward dictatorial rule in the philippines 
but that was a brighterthanusual period in the committees long 
decline 
over the years other committees have chipped away at the panels 
jurisdiction 
nonmembers often have taken the lead in foreign policy 
initiatives 
and many foreign policy issues now are shaped not in the 
committee but when they reach the senate floor

advisers to congress are pushing aid to third 
world farmers on the premise that the more food they produce the 
more food their countries will buy from this country 
according to a special study by the congressional budget office 
the seeming contradiction works this way 
as third world farmers increase their output their countries 
growth speeds up too more growth means higher incomes especially 
when third world governments raise the prices they pay to their 
farmers as many are now doing in most of those countries unlike 
the united states a huge proportion of people still live in the 
country including the poorest people 
they not only grow food they also have to buy some as they earn 
more they buy more and they buy a greater variety poor people 
spend a larger part of their income on food than the more prosperous 
do and in some countries the population is growing faster than home 
production 
in many cases the demand for food grows faster than the supply 
of food resulting in greater food imports says the report 
written by stephen parker of the cbos natural resources and 
commerce division 
that view has important support in congress 
sen patrick j leahy dvt chairman of the agriculture 
committee said the report underscores what seems like a real 
paradox that we help us farmers by helping third world 
agriculture if we ignore this in setting our aid trade and 
macroeconomic policies we are just shooting ourselves in the foot 
like all general rules this one has its exceptions we should 
not ignore these but dont let the exceptions blind us to where 
our us interests lie leahy said 
some us farmers see brazil argentina and paraguay as among the 
leading exceptions countries where farmers have had direct or 
indirect aid from the united states they have become important 
competitors in one of the most lucrative us crops soybeans 
concerns have arisen in the american agricultural community 
over how us assistance may benefit third world economies to the 
detriment of us farmers said rep e kika de la garza 
dtex chairman of the house agriculture committee 
but where assistance directly from the us or through 
multilateral institutions has been provided and resulted in new 
competition for the us it has also led to an increase in that 
countrys economic and income growth 
between 1970 and 1985 us sales of farm products to third world 
countries grew from 24 billion to 127 billion 
the report says that on average people in the third world consume 
35 percent fewer calories and 40 percent less protein than americans 
the huge potential consumption among these 3 billion people 
will become actual as their incomes rise the report predicts 
because the office represents both parties in congress it made 
no specific recommendations but it said recent us government 
reviews suggest that current american aid is not effectively helping 
poor countries to develop it gave figures that show the bush 
administration seeking less aid for farm development abroad this 
year that president reagan sought in 1987 
for countries in asia and the middle east the requested figure 
was 1742 million compared with 2379 million in 1987 the total 
for latin america was down to 1445 million from 1788 million 
some members of congress have called such amounts so small as to 
have a negligible effect and are working on a complete 
reorganization of us aid programs additional money for farmers 
comes from the world bank the interamerican development bank and 
others to which the united states is a major contributor

export subsidies have been almost as important 
as rain to the american wheat farmer in recent years 
since congress authorized the subsidies in the 1985 farm law the 
program has cost more than 25 billion and has accounted for about 
twothirds of all us wheat sold to foreign buyers 
according to one agriculture department analyst the subsidies 
provided by the export enhancement program or eep may have boosted 
the us price of wheat by a much as a fifth through the larger 
volume of shipments 
the soviet union and china have been the biggest beneficiaries of 
the subsidized sales but about two dozen other countries also have 
shared in the program 
soviet wheat purchases under eep since the program began totaled 
171 million tons through may 5 representing 28 percent of the 606 
million tons shipped to all countries designated for the cutrate 
grain 
china with purchases of 123 million tons has accounted for 
about 20 percent of the eep wheat total 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
under the program private exporters can sell wheat or other 
designated commodities to an eligible country at prices lower than 
otherwise would be charged the main purpose of eep is to allow us 
grain to compete with subsidized exports by the european economic 
community the 12nation trading bloc that is also known as the 
common market 
the exporters then collect a bonus or subsidy to make up for 
the reduced price charged to the foreign buyer the subsidies are in 
the form of surplus commodities owned by the departments commodity 
credit corp 
a debate has raged within the bush administration and in congress 
on whether the subsidy program has been worth it farm advocates say 
eep is necessary and has helped drive some countries including the 
common market to the bargaining table on trade negotiations 
new studies have been ordered to help sort out the good and bad 
about eep including one being put together by the departments 
economics staff that report however is still waiting on final 
clearance 
meanwhile the departments economic research service has 
circulated a new theoretical computer study that includes an 
evaluation of eep and its impact on us wheat prices and exports 
the highly technical computer study by economist stephen l 
haley includes several scenarios of possibilities based on the 
198687 crop year a central part of the study involves pitting the 
us subsidy system against the european common markets program of 
export subsidies or restitution prices 
haley noted that there has been a dramatic turnaround in us 
wheat exports the past two years after bottoming out at 249 
million metric tons in the 198586 crop year export volume increase 
by more than 9 percent to 273 million tons in 1986 and by 59 
percent to 433 million tons in 198788 
the us share of the world wheat market increase to more than 41 
percent in 198788 from 31 percent in 198687 at the same time he 
said the us wheat inventory declined by 30 percent a sign of 
export growth 
haley said a number of factors have been involved in the export 
surge including changes in us farm policy lower price support 
loan rates provided by the 1985 farm law a steady level of target 
prices used to compute government payments to growers and the 
export subsidy program 
other factors contributing to the turnaround included a 
depreciation in the value of the us dollar and production 
shortfalls outside the united states he said a problem for 
policy makers has been to sort out the relative contribution of each 
of these factors to the turnabout 
haley said that depending on ones interpretation of the 
european economic communitys motivation for its own export subsidy 
program the us subsidies have likely increased the us price 
of wheat between 7 percent and 22 percent us wheat export volume 
between 10 percent and 31 percent and us wheat export revenue 
between 18 percent and 61 percent 
in another finding the computer study showed that the european 
bloc would be a wheat importer rather than export without its 
system of export subsidies 
the scenarios imply that the eecs comparative disadvantage in 
world wheat trade makes it extremely vulnerable to policies of the 
united states and to currency realignments haley said this 
vulnerability helps explain why the eec attempts to insulate itself 
from shocks affecting the world wheat market

george bush turns 65 today only the 13th 
president in us history to hit that milestone while in office 
friends and experts say they dont expect his new status as 
senior citizen to slow down bush a trim nonsmoker who jogs and 
plays tennis regularly 
ive known him for a long time and ive never seen him look 
better says white house physician burton lee aging is 
different in all of us and certainly exercise retards it 
dr t franklin williams director of the national institute on 
aging says i dont know anything at all about president bushs 
medical history but just to observe him from a distance i would 
predict he has 25 or 30 good years ahead of him anyhow 
bush appears to have both the actuarial tables and genes on his 
side 
the presidents mother dorothy walker bush is 87 and living in 
greenwich conn his father the late sen prescott bush died in 
1972 at age 77 
bush is just one of 4000 americans turning 65 today and for 
that matter every day of the year 
there are 31 million americans 65 or older now and there will be 
35 million by the end of the 1990s 
a growing segment of them are living to truly advanced old ages 
williams said the number of american centenarians now around 
25000 will exceed 100000 by the turn of the century 
perhaps because he followed the oldest president in us history 
ronald reagan little attention has been paid to bushs age 
he is 13 years younger than reagan who was 77 when he exited the 
oval office 
but at 64 bush was the fourth oldest man ever inaugurated 
behind reagan 69 william henry harrison 68 and james buchanan 
65 
he now is junior to only a dozen presidents including george 
washington who was nine days past his 65th birthday when he 
finished his two terms thomas jefferson who was almost 66 and 
dwight d eisenhower who was 70 
if 65 was once the demarcation point of old age it is no longer 
clearly so 
the average life expectancy for a man turning 65 is 15 years to 
80 and for a woman 189 years or almost 84 life expectancy at 
birth is somewhat lower 717 for men and 783 for women 
i dont think old age means very much to an awful lot of 
people williams said in an interview theres no inevitable 
decline with aging 
we have lots of good research data showing many people live 
into their 90s in very good health and functioning he said 
humans who have a reasonably good lifestyle and are fortunate 
enough not to have one of the major diseases can be essentially 
as functional in their 80s and 90s as young people 
williams who is 67 got a cartoon from his secretary on his 40th 
birthday showing a mountain and a person walking down the far side 
of it 
i think that was an exaggeration i think the same thing can be 
said about 65 now its not really the 
goingdownthebacksideofthemountain that we once thought it 
was he said 
sixtyfive is still the age at which retired workers can first 
draw their full social security benefits and medicare hospital 
insurance 
bush cant draw social security because of his 200000 salary as 
president 
social security recipients will lose 1 in benefits for every 2 
in earnings above 9360 in 1990 the maximum someone born in 1924 
and retiring this year can get from social security is 899 a month 
although bush gets all the free medical care he wants he could 
elect to file for medicare now if he fails to do so within three 
months of his 65th birthday he may wind up having to pay stiffer 
premiums in later life for medicares doctor coverage 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said he wasnt sure 
what the presidents plans were for social security 
he was spending the milestone birthday unveiling a sweeping 
proposal to clean up the nations polluted air then hopping aboard 
air force one to visit one of americas most pristine settings the 
grand tetons and yellowstone national park in wyoming

south american drug dealers have been making 
increasing use of cuban air space and territorial waters for 
usbound narcotics deliveries an activity that us officials say 
strongly suggests the collaboration of cuban authorities 
cuba is directly in the flight path between colombia and south 
florida and the number of suspicious northbound flights through 
cuban airspace has gone up over the past several months according 
to administration officials 
the coast guard also has detected an increase in air drops of 
drugs into cuban territorial waters the cargo is then picked up by 
speedboats for delivery to us ports the officials said 
over the past six months there have been increasing reports of 
specific incidents one official said 
the cuban diplomatic mission here said it totally rejects the 
charges and the unserious way in which they were made by us 
officials all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the allegations were made a cuban spokesman said without any 
proof or foundation he added that it was part of a campaign to 
discredit cuba that the united states has waged for years 
allegations of cuban involvement in drug smuggling have 
circulated for years and us officials acknowledge their suspicions 
of an increase in this activity are largely circumstantial 
the officials said the way cuban society is organized it is 
inconceivable that cuban authorities could be involved without the 
knowledge of officials at the highest level 
the suspicions of us officials were reinforced by recent 
testimony by two colombians who face long us prison terms for drug 
smuggling they said that large shipments of cocaine were flown on 
two occasions in 1987 from colombia to an airfield in cuba and then 
were sent to florida aboard vessels 
according to the testimony both of the shipments contained 1000 
pounds of cocaine the first was seized by us customs agents the 
two colombians are expected to be sentenced in florida later this 
month 
another official said increasing numbers of planes an average 
of about three a week that cross cuba have been spotted but added 
that it is not clear whether this represents a net growth or simply 
an improvement in us detection 
he said us monitoring operations have been able to observe 
airdrops by planes to fast boats within cuban territorial waters 
once the vessels are loaded they mill around cuban waters 
awaiting the departure of coast guard boats stationed in the 
adjacent us waters 
eventually the us vessels get called away leaving the coast 
clear for the drug boat to head for florida unimpeded the official 
said 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and control has been encouraging the 
administration to enlist cubas support in the fight against drug 
smuggling 
based on talks late last year with cuban leader fidel castro 
rangel has said he is convinced castro sincerely wants to cooperate 
rangel was outraged several months ago when the administration 
refused to give a visa to the mayor of havana to take part in an 
antidrug conference in new york city 
castro has often contrasted cubas drugfree society with the 
millions in the united states who suffer from narcotics addiction 
us officials have told rangel that it would be unseemly for the 
united states to seek cooperation from a government which the 
administration believes is actively involved in the drug trade 
if they have anything evidence of drug smuggling and want to 
show it to us we would welcome it one official said 
jose blandon a former top adviser to the panamanian government 
who used to make official trips to cuba on behalf of gen manuel 
antonio noriega told congress in february 1988 that castro sees 
narcotics smuggling as element of a broader antiamerican strategy 
blandon said us military involvement in central america gave 
castro the moral justification to do anything against the united 
states anything that was necessary

perfect beach weather you say a great day to grab your towel 
shades sunblock the latest best seller and head for sandy shores 
just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water a 
virtual sand trap of rules and regulations awaits governing such 
things as your oceanside attire what you pack in your cooler even 
whether you can toss a frisbee 
you think fido might enjoy a romp in the waves sorry but an 
informal survey of beach restrictions on both coasts and some inland 
beaches shows that most ban dogs at least during the summer 
frankly people just dont want to put their beach blankets 
down next to a pile of deep doodoo said east hampton supervisor 
tony bullock on new yorks long island horses are prohibited too 
wayne shattaway a lifeguard at jacksonville beach in florida 
which even hired a dogcatcher to patrol the beach said dogs can 
sometimes be aggressive to strangers 
right now rotweilers and dobermans are the popular dogs here 
if there was just poodles on the beach it wouldnt be a problem 
he said 
bottles and glass containers are banned virtually everywhere 
restrictions on cans are almost as rampant and if youre toting 
anything stronger than soft drinks thats likely to be forbidden 
too 
the liquor sun and surf just didnt mix said john crisp 
assistant chief of the volusia county beach patrol explaining why 
the florida county which covers daytona beach ormond beach new 
smyrna beach and daytona beach shores eliminated alcohol a few 
years ago 
well how about packing some hot dogs and having a barbecue 
open fires are banned on virginia beach va alabamas gulf of 
mexico shoreline californias los angeles county and long island 
and new jersey beaches to name a few cape cod national seashore in 
massachusetts bans fires without a permit wrightsville beach nc 
bans grills 
a few years ago people would cook with charcoal on the beach 
and then dump the hot charcoal in the sand and cover it up then 
someone else would come walking along and step on it and ruin their 
day said wrightsville beach police chief george antley 
frisbees are banned at hilton head island sc long island 
virginia beach among other places 
no ball playing of any kind on ocean city md beaches from 9

los angeles county beaches have a flying missile ordinance to 
quell beer hurtling 
even president bushs favorite pastime horseshoes is banned 
at hilton head according to cynthia harrison a code enforcement 
officer for the popular resort area 
most beaches have general rules banning nudity or indecent 
exposure but what is indecent is subject to debate 
thong bathing suits swimsuits that expose the derriere arent 
considered appropriate attire in north myrtle beach myrtle beach 
and the isle of palms sc 
thongs are ok on hilton head but tshirts that say lifeguard 
are not unless the wearer really is a lifeguard 
other rules include no swimming in water deeper than your

national seashore no radio playing without earphones on new yorks 
jones beach and no swimming at surfrider beach a surfingonly 
beach in malibu calif volleyball is allowed on myrtle beach but 
leaving the net up overnight will get you fined 
driving on the beach in a regular vehicle is prohibited almost 
everywhere except where the beaches have hardpacked sand such as 
along the washington coastline but proposed legislation there will 
probably ban that activity by next summer 
fourwheel drives and dune buggies are banned in many places for 
environmental reasons including sections of the oregon coast the 
florida panhandle some new jersey communities and parts of long

iceland says it will never stop whaling 
and will survive an international boycott launched by the 
environmental group greenpeace 
we will never give it up come hell or high water foreign 
minister jon baldvin hannibalsson said in an interview it would 
be the same as to underwrite our own verdict of execution 
whaling is a tiny facet of the economy of this remote north 
atlantic island and the vast majority of the 247000 icelanders 
dont even like whale meat 
but icelands existence depends on the sea and the government 
wont relinquish sovereignty over any of its natural resources 
in february 1988 greenpeace launched a boycott of icelandic 
fish which accounts for 75 percent of the countrys exports the 
antiwhaling campaign targeted three of icelands biggest markets 
the united states west germany and britain 
ros reeve a greenpeace campaigner who is in san diego for 
todays annual meeting of the international whaling commission 
estimated in a telephone interview that iceland may have lost up to 
50 million worth of contracts 
hannibalsson said the boycott has forced the closure of several 
fish processing and canning factories mainly in sparsely populated 
northern iceland and several hundred people have lost their jobs 
iceland says it has given up commercial whale hunting but still 
kills whales under a fouryear research program approved by the 
whaling commission that allowed it to kill 78 whales in 1988 
greenpeace contends the program is a cover for commercial 
whaling which the commission halted from 1986 to 1990 to preserve 
endangered stocks 
the hunt is being carried out by the commercial whaling company 
and iceland is selling whale meat to japan the environmental 
organization says 
hannibalsson countered that the commission allows up to 49 
percent of whale meat to be exported and the sales financed the 
scientific program 
it is our sovereign right to carry out scientific research 
which is the basis for our fishing policy hannibalsson said in 
the interview last week he said researchers had counted more than 
70000 whales in icelands 200mile economic zone 
ms reeve said the commission never intended scientific whaling 
to include mass killings she accused iceland of using the loophole 
to keep its whaling fleet intact pending the commissions review of 
the moratorium in 1990 
fisheries minister halldor asgrimsson has said it is unlikely 
iceland will go whaling in 1990 
greenpeace selected iceland for the boycott because iceland 
created the precedent for scientific whaling which was followed by 
japan and norway ms reeve said 
in the united states she said the long john silver seafood 
chain canceled a 9 million contract burger king cut its buying by 
20 percent and boston banned icelandic fish in schools and 
institutions 
though more than 80 percent of icelanders supported the 
governments position in a recent poll greenpeace has one powerful 
supporter gudrun helgadottir president of the althing icelands 
parliament 
iceland has shamed itself in environmental affairs she said 
this has turned into a nationalistic cause which is very 
dangerous because it prevents you from debating the issue seriously 
and rationally 
hanniballson said iceland would not be deterred 
it survived a british quarantine on icelandic cod by finding new 
markets from 1956 to 1976 when london accepted icelands 200mile 
zone 
we will survive this too he said

actress theresa saldanas plea helped keep 
the man who almost killed her locked up but despite public 
outrage notorious convicts have been freed from california prisons 
arthur richard jackson who was set for a parole hearing 
thursday instead was charged with eight felony counts for allegedly 
issuing threats to kill saldana conviction could keep him in prison 
for seven more years los angeles district attorney ira reiner says 
but the ones released form a rogues gallery familiar to most 
golden state residents and many people across the country 
theres lawrence singleton who raped a hitchhiker and then 
chopped off her forearms with an ax ted streleski who battered his 
stanford university professor to death then refused to say he 
wouldnt kill again and dan white released after serving just a 
few years for the assassinations of san franciscos mayor and 
another politician 
these men and others symbolize for many californians some of the 
bigger problems with the states penal code 
jackson who had served seven years of a 12year sentence for the 
attack outside saldanas west hollywood home was to be deported 
after his parole 
but after saldana said she was terrified he might have returned 
illegally to carry out threats to kill her reiner filed the charges 
against jackson 
saldana went on television talk shows to publicize the parole 
hearing and won support from elected officials 
but a storm of protest over whites release failed to stop it 
white a former san francisco city supervisor who shot and killed 
mayor george moscone and supervisor harvey milk in city hall in 
1978 served fewer than seven years in prison shortly after his 
release he committed suicide 
many law enforcement officials however say public fears dont 
necessarily reflect reality when it comes to freeing people like 
singleton jackson and white 
with intensified supervision and special parole conditions i 
dont know of many situations where victims have been harassed after 
a person has gotten out of prison said assistant attorney general 
dick iglehart 
some blame a 1977 state sentencing law for releasing some 
criminals after serving relatively light sentences the law stripped 
the state board of prison terms of much of its power to decide when 
criminals should be released 
one critic of the law is alan nudelman deputy supervising 
district attorney for santa clara county he prosecuted streleski 
though he never expressed remorse for killing a stanford 
professor in 1978 streleski was a model prisoner during his seven 
years behind bars he refused parole three times opting to serve 
his complete sentence so there would be no restrictions on his 
movements 
a year after the convictions of streleski and white voters 
approved an initiative calling for stiffer sentences for murder 
nudelman views the time between the two measures as a dark period 
in the states legal history 
the whole determinate sentence scheme brought forth any number 
of miscarriages of justice resulting in a great deal of public 
outrage he said someone like streleski would never have gone 
out based on his lack of remorse and his attitude toward the body 
politic in general 
other releases that caused public outrage include 
william archie fain served 16 years for the 1967 slaying of a 
17yearold boy and the rape of two teenage girls fain was 
released despite public protest and the objections of gov george 
deukmejian last year he was arrested in connection with the attack 
of a hayward school teacher 
onion field cop killer jimmy lee smith was paroled in 1982 
despite loud protests from police and the public last wednesday 
smith was sentenced to three months in jail on drug charges 
today only a few crimes including first and seconddegree 
murder and kidnapping for the purpose of robbery carry 
indeterminate sentences 
although it seems a popular notion that california is lax on 
criminals sentencing laws are not dramatically different from those 
elsewhere said robert weisberg a criminal law professor at 
stanford university 
california just has more notorious criminals he said

a prosecutor investigating the 1980 crash of an 
italian civilian jetliner that was downed by a missile or a bomb 
told a magistrate that military officials may have suppressed vital 
evidence 
deputy prosecutor giorgio santacroce contends officials at two 
military radar centers may have destroyed essential radar tapes 
lied to investigators and illegally suppressed the truth 
he asked magistrate vittorio bucarelli on saturday to notify the 
officials they were under investigation in connection with the june 
27 1980 crash that killed all 81 people aboard 
the dc9 jetliner of the domestic carrier itavia was on a flight 
from bologna to palermo sicily when an explosion sent it plunging 
into the tyrrhenian sea 
a commission of experts appointed by bucarelli who is in charge 
of the investigation concluded in march that the airliner was hit 
by a missile fired by an unidentified warplane 
however another commission appointed by premier ciriaco de mita 
said last month that a bomb may have been smuggled aboard the 
jetliner 
italian news agencies said santacroce is investigating the 
possibility that the commander of the military radar center at 
licola ordered the destruction of crucial radar tapes made the day 
of the crash 
the agencies said he also was considering charging 22 servicemen 
at the radar centers at licola and marsala sicily with suppression 
of evidence perjury or complicity 
santacroce told bucarelli that there was a strong suspicion 
that key radar tapes had been altered 
the prosecutor noted what he called an unexplained disappearance 
from the monitor of radar tracks fundamental to the investigation 
and a hole of eight minutes in the tapes 
government officials including defense minister valerio zanone 
have vigorously denied any government coverup of the disaster and 
also have denied an italian warplane could have been involved 
the commission appointed by the premier also said it received 
assurances from the defense ministry and nato that no military 
exercises were under way in the area at the time of the crash 
it said the united states france britain west germany and 
israel also said they had no ships or planes in the area at the time 
twenty days after the crash the wreckage of a libyan warplane 
was found in southern italy the discovery led to speculation that 
the libyan jet either fired or had been the target of the missile 
however an italian judge recently said he found no evidence to 
support the theory

the government has ordered the arrest of the 
former chief of mexicos federal investigative forces in the 1984 
slaying of a leading newspaper columnist known for his exposes of 
official corruption 
an investigation by a special prosecutor produced enough evidence 
to charge jose antonio zorrilla perez with the killing of manuel 
buendia who frequently criticized the government in his frontpage 
column in the newspaper excelsior 
zorilla 49 headed the federal security department from 1981 to 
mid1984 he met with buendia three times in the month before the 
slaying including the night before the fatal shooting the union of 
democratic journalists says 
buendias slaying in a parking garage in mexico city had been one 
of the countrys most prominent unsolved crimes 
the government news agency notimex said police searched zorillas 
home in a wealthy neighborhood in the southern part of the capital 
late sunday but he was not yet under arrest 
authorities had named zorrilla as a suspect as early as january 
1988 in recent weeks he has been widely mentioned in news reports 
as the principal suspect 
miguel angel garcia dominguez the special prosecutor in the 
case says testimony in the past two months led investigators to 
conclude that zorrilla was responsible for the killing 
although never charged zorrilla had been linked to mexican 
narcotics kingpins including rafael caro quintero who is accused in 
the 1985 torture and killing of us narcotics agent enrique 
camarena 
caro quintero fled the western city of guadalajara in a private 
jet two days after camarenas abduction there allegedly with police 
credentials and while police stood by he is serving a 34year 
sentence on drug and other charges and awaiting disposition of the 
homicide case 
zorilla also has been mentioned in news reports in connection 
with the deaths of three policemen and an investigator 
he was suspended from the security post in mid1984 and in 1985 
was dropped as a congressional candidate for the governing 
institutional revolutionary party amid reports that he was under 
investigation 
the security department an investigative agency similar to the 
fbi was later abolished 
earlier zorrilla was private secretary to fernando gutierrez 
barrios deputy interior secretary at the time and now the 
secretary he held political posts in the northern state of hidalgo 
and served a term in congress 
garcia dominguez gave no details of the evidence that linked 
zorrilla to buendia murder case 
however the union of democratic journalists an organization of 
liberal journalists said in late may that their investigation found 
buendia had been followed by the agents of zorrillas department for 
more than three months before the may 30 killing the magazine 
proceso said last month 
buendia wrote about sensitive issues most other columnists 
avoided the clergy rightwing paramilitary groups officials 
involved in drug dealing weapons trafficking and the complicity of 
authorities in contraband 
he wrote a book the cia in mexico published in 1983 and 
often criticized us policy in central america and elsewhere 
journalists have alleged political interference has delayed the 
investigation of buendias killing 
president carlos salinas de gortari promised during a press 
freedom day luncheon on thursday to continue investigating the case

labor organizers say more and more doctors are 
joining the ranks of several unions nationwide a trend that could 
change the rules by which medical professionals play 
before doctors take the lives of others into their hands they 
take a hippocratic oath to act with purity and with holiness a 
mandate that raises ethical questions about whether a doctors 
walkout would say stop a parent from rushing a sick child past 
pickets and into an emergency room 
still does that oath deprive doctors of the right to protect 
their own interests financial and otherwise 
union proponents and medical ethicists say no up to a point 
dr sanford a marcus president of the union of american 
physicians and dentists said his oakland califbased consortium 
has 50000 members and is growing he said members affiliated 
through a number of offshoots around the country are working 
together to advocate the rights of both physicians and their 
patients 
the entire field of health care financing and distribution is 
being stood on its ear in these times marcus said the rules 
are going to change an awful lot 
since the mid1980s membership in health maintenance 
organizations has risen around the nation the prepaid medical plans 
generally employ specific doctors and hospitals that provide reduced 
rate care to hmo members 
in a traditional insurance plan the more tests that are ordered 
the more hospital days that are consumed and the more money is made 
by the physician said alan raymond a vice president with the 
500000member harvard health plan 
raymond said health plans benefit both parties by bringing more 
patients to doctors and reduced costs to those who need health care 
but dr arthur caplan a bioethicist at the university of 
minnesota said the shift to group plans has put doctors under new 
strains that might best be eased through unionization 
its a reaction by doctors feeling increasingly disenfranchised 
within the health care system and by cost containment measures that 
are basically shifting the structure of medicine away from a 
profession and more toward a business he said in a telephone 
interview from minneapolis 
the medical profession has had no power said edward hanley 
who directs the 1000member doctors and surgeons association of 
massachusetts they arent in the business of negotiating the 
economics theyre trained to help people who are ill 
he said doctors need to unionize to negotiate more effectively 
the hmo contracts theyve accepted often out of fear that their 
patient load would diminish as consumers increasingly opted out of 
traditional thirdparty insurance 
dr barry leibowitz president of the new yorkbased doctors 
council said doctors have also begun complaining that health care 
decisions have been usurped as hmo managers lay down guidelines 
anyone whos salaried and not protected by a union is subject 
to the vagaries of the marketplace and management he said the 
employers have very little understanding of what a physician 
needs to function 
aside from patients concerns union organizers conceded doctors 
were not entirely above materialism and the possible fringe benefits 
that collective bargaining might provide 
somebody has got to be there to help them get a good shake 
the uapds marcus said 
ethically speaking caplan said he saw no problem with unions and 
that in some cases they might be overdue 
the bioethicist did however draw the line where strikes were 
concerned failing to honor their patients needs before their own 
selfinterests would constitute a serious breach he said 
marcus said he was confident medical union members would never 
let a patients care suffer 
we would never withhold care he said thats not to say we 
wouldnt strike against the fiscal machine the bureaucracy or the 
industrial complex that has been built out of health care but the 
patient must be taken care of under all circumstances

abc news seeking to protect chinese citizens 
from being arrested covered up the faces of students who provided 
firsthand descriptions of the army killing protesters in tiananmen 
square 
abc shielded the students faces on its sunday evening news 
program after a man who was interviewed by the network last week was 
arrested 
the governmentcontrolled chinese network had intercepted raw 
footage of an interview that abc crews in beijing sent to new york 
the chinese network on saturday broadcast more than a minute of 
tape that never was shown by abc last week abc showed the mans 
face briefly but did not broadcast his voice 
in its sunday newscast abc quoted the unidentified students as 
saying that to preserve our strength and prevent more losses we 
can only go underground 
we dont have fear anymore death was very near we are no 
longer worried about ourselves the students said 
chinese television on saturday broadcast footage of the man 
telling abc that 20000 people were killed in the military crackdown 
of the prodemocracy uprising it accused him of rumormongering 
and appealed to the public to turn him in 
the national chinese television on sunday announced the mans 
arrest in the northeastern city of dalian after he was turned in by 
two women 
we are deeply distressed to learn that in this instance the 
chinese authorities intercepted unedited news material that was 
being satellited and used it for political purposes the network 
said in a statement 
abc spokeswoman laura wessner said that last monday world news 
tonight used about eight seconds of the tape 
ms wessner said she did not know how the raw footage was 
intercepted by chinese authorities which broadcast one minute and 
nine seconds of the mans interview with abc 
our feeling is that he said nothing more inflammatory than 
anyone else interviewed in the past month she said 
the chinese government has said nearly 300 people were killed but 
that most were soldiers attacked by ruffians chinese witnesses 
and western intelligence sources have said as many as 3000 may have 
died when troops fired on crowds of unarmed citizens 
the abc statement said the network would continue its routine 
coverage of news in china and in keeping with its news policy 
would continue to honor requests of anonymity from any person who 
agrees to an interview and has reason to suspect possible adverse 
consequences 
after the raw abc tape was shown on chinese television nbc 
issued a written statement sunday nbc news will continue to cover 
events in china as we are able but we will have a renewed 
sensitivity that the chinese authorities may be monitoring our news 
reporting and news interviewing and will take precautions 
accordingly 
nbc spokeswoman virginia holden said that the chinese have not 
intercepted any of their satellite feeds to the united states but 
that it would tape people in silhouette if they requested anonymity 
cbs spokesman tom goodman said were going to examine the 
situation

monica bayer of the catholic health association of the united 
states said sunday the groups 599 member hospitals would lose about 
750 million overall 
a report critical consequences the financial impact of 
medicares prospective payment system on catholic health association 
member hospitals was released during the groups 74th annual 
meeting which runs through tuesday

would lose 219 percent or more overall on medicare patients this 
year the seventh year under the prospective payment system 
in that method which is used nationwide except in new york new 
jersey massachusetts and maryland payments for medicare patients 
are based on the diagnoses rather than on the hospitals actual

the navy will stop storing gunpowder for its 
iowaclass battleships aboard unventilated barges following the 
fatal explosion on the uss iowa according to a published report 
the change comes despite the navys belief that gunpowder was not 
at fault for the fatal blast 
construction of additional magazines at the yorktown naval 
weapons station will eliminate the need to store munitions aboard 
barges on the york river navy officials told the virginianpilot 
and the ledgerstar of norfolk 
when the battleship wisconsin heads for maintenance and repairs 
this summer its powder charges 110pound bags will not be 
stored aboard uncooled unventilated barges as the iowas were the 
newspaper reported in sunday editions 
when the iowa went in for similar overhaul last summer its 
powder was stored aboard uncooled barges at the yorktown station 
during the hottest part of the season 
in april 47 sailors aboard the iowa were killed when powder 
exploded in the no 2 gun turret during open seas gunnery practice 
before the explosion the no 1 turret had a misfire when the five 
bags of powder used to propel the guns projectile wouldnt ignite 
navy officials have said they do not believe the storage of the 
powder was to blame and are investigating the possibility of 
sabotage nevertheless the charges aboard the iowa have been 
removed and replaced with powder that was stored in 
temperaturecontrolled underground bunkers 
navy officials did not monitor either the temperatures or 
humidity aboard the barges though the newspaper reported that the 
stations safety officer had complained the munitions needed to be 
moved 
permitting these charges to be stored in the barge for this 
period of time indicates the lack of importance that is placed on 
compliance with the safety requirements set forth in the navys 
manual on munition storage a memo from the unidentified safety 
officer said in september 1988 
those powder charges were later returned to the iowa when it came 
back from its scheduled shipyard visit 
munitions experts and the navy manual say that prolonged exposure 
to high temperatures and humidity can lead to deterioration of the 
powder charges making them either inert or extremely volatile 
the internal report estimates the temperature inside the 
aluminumsided barges were 25 degrees higher than the outside air 
temperature using that estimate the newspaper calculated from 
national weather service readings for the area that the temperature 
inside the barges could have exceeded 110 degrees on 66 days during 
the time the powder was in storage 
thomas black administrative officer at the yorktown station 
said the wisconsins powder would not be stored at the station the 
largest of the navys six weapon stations 
black said additional magazines are being built at the weapons 
station to accommodate more munitions according to the pentagon 
yorktown is the only one of the navys munitions stations that uses 
barges for temporary powder storage

contra rebel leader alfredo cesar has 
ended seven years of exile and returned home to join the political 
battle against the sandinista government 
cesars return on sunday follows that of two other contra leaders 
over the past two weeks both signed an amnesty document saying they 
do not support armed struggle against the leftist sandinistas 
cesar said he came to nicaragua to devote myself exclusively to 
the civic political fight he would not say if he had resigned as 
one of seven director of the nicaraguan resistance the organization 
of the usbacked contras 
i bring a message of hope that we should prepare that the 
fight ahead of us in the electoral arena is a vital struggle for 
nicaragua and that we are going to win if we organize well 
cesar told reporters at the managua international airport after 
arriving from miami via guatemala 
the 38yearold cesar said he would join the social democratic 
party but would not seek an elective post in general elections 
scheduled for february 
cesar was president of the central bank when he left the country 
on april 25 1982 he had lived in miami where the nicaraguan 
resistance is based 
nine other exiles and contra members returned on a commercial 
flight about one hour before cesar arrived on a small jet that his 
wife sylvia lacayo de cesar said was provided by the venezuelan 
government 
the other opposition leaders who recently returned are azucena 
ferrey who resigned as member of the directorate last fall and 
fernando aguero who helped negotiate a temporary ceasefire between 
the contras and the sandinistas in march 1988 
the united states cut off military aid to the rebels a month 
earlier and most contra fighters fled to camps in neighboring 
honduras 
the sandinistas took power in july 1979 after spearheading a 
civil war that toppled the rightist government of president 
anastasio somoza 
in another development the government devalued the currency by 
525 percent effective today and raised gasoline prices by the 
same amount it was the 20th devaluation of the cordoba this year 
and the second this month 
the rate fell from 9500 cordobas to 20000 cordobas to the 
dollar 
gasoline will rise from 17700 cordobas to 37200 cordobas a 
gallon or about 185 
banking officials have said the frequent devaluations are to 
maintain the profitability of export products 
the devaluations generate substantial increases in what residents 
must pay for basic products

a time bomb exploded in a crowded 
passenger hall at the capitals main railroad station today killing 
at least seven people and injuring 54 others police said 
twelve of the injured lost arms or legs the police control 
center said 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility 
i heard a very loud sound and then saw smoke blood and limbs 
around me said ramesh kumar who was in the hall but escaped 
injury it was like hell i thought i was seeing a bad bloody 
movie 
blood from the victims many of whom were waiting to board trains 
for summer vacations splattered the halls 60foot high ceiling and 
at least a 100squarefoot section of the floor 
it was a time bomb and a very very powerful one police 
commissioner rajindra mohan said at the scene 
he said forensic experts had recovered a portion of the bomb that 
contained an intact battery cell and nuts and bolts which would 
have spewed out with deadly force 
the bomb left a crater about one foot deep and two feet in 
diameter in the station floor 
sandals sunglasses cooked rice and halfeaten bread were strewn 
across the floor blown by the force of the blast or dropped by 
panicked people 
here and there were the bodies of pigeons who normally roost on 
the ceilings lights 
mohan said waiting passengers often lie or sleep on the floor of 
the hall and he said many more people might have been killed had 
they been standing when the bomb went off 
new delhis 32000 police were put on alert the city government 
broadcast warnings against touching objects left in public places 
the citys exit routes were blocked vehicles leaving the capital 
were checked 
mohan declined to say who might have been behind the bombing 
the press trust of india quoted a witness pawan kumar as saying 
he saw a man with a mustache ask someone to watch his briefcase and 
a wooden crate while he went to get a drink of water a few minutes 
later the bomb exploded in the same spot the news agency quoted 
kumar as saying 
railways minister madhavrao scindia asked if he thought the 
blast was the work of sikh extremists who set off a series of bombs 
in the capital in 1985 said i will not rule out the involvement 
of terrorism it looks like the job can only be done by them 
scindia would not say whether he was referring to sikhs the 
government routinely speaks only of terrorists when referring to 
sikh radicals whose campaign for a separate homeland has claimed 
about 850 lives this year in northern punjab state 
the last major sikh attack in new delhi occurred nearly a year 
ago four people were killed and more than 40 wounded on june 20 
1988 when sikh militants hurled a grenade into a crowded outdoor 
market 
in 1985 a series of bombs often concealed in transistor radios 
killed at least 87 people in the capital 
the bomb at the station went off at 1035 am a peak hour at 
the station when most trains from eastern india arrive in new delhi 
from 600 to 700 people were in the passenger hall at the time 
more than 150000 people and at least 158 trains pass through the 
station daily

prices surged 09 percent in may the rise had been expected to be 
nearer the moderate climbs of 04 percent in both march and april

unknown the central bank does not comment on its foreign exchange 
operations

new security systems capable of detecting plastic 
explosives were displayed by two us companies at the paris air 
show the first international air exposition since the december 
bombing of a pan am jetliner 
the federal aviation administration invited the companies to show 
the technology on the market for the first time this spring during 
the 10day gathering at le bourget airport north of paris 
in recent years searches metal detectors and xray machines 
have become routine at airports and the number of hijackings has 
declined but passenger planes remain vulnerable to hidden devices 
it takes less than a pound of plastic explosive the size of a 
chocolate bar to bring down a jumbo jet the deadly material can be 
molded into shapes that are easy to hide 
such an explosive hidden in a radiocasette player is believed to 
have caused the death of 275 passengers anbd crew who were aboard 
pan am flight 103 which fell in pieces onto the scottish village of 
lockerbee in december 
thermedics inc of woburn mass came up with a sniffer that 
detects chemical vapors the 125000 handheld sniffer called 
egis is a computerized chemical analyzer with programmed rules 
called algorithms 
if you look at the last 15 incidents of bombing or attempted 
bombing in six of them the bomb found its way into the aircraft 
cabin said thermedics president john w wood jr on sunday 
this illustrates the need to screen people and carry on bags as 
well as checked luggage 
thermedics has developed a second sniffer that is about a year 
away from the markeplace it is called securscan and works on the 
same principle as egis but is designed as a walkthrough chamber 
similar to the now common metal detector 
a second new device is being shown by science international 
applications corp of santa clara calif their apparatus is called 
a thermal neutron activation or tna and sells for 900000 
baggage passes on a conveyor belt through a chamber where it is 
showered with neutrons that react when exposed to nitrogen the 
chemical emitted by virtually all explosives the reaction produces 
a scattering of gamma rays a sort of chemical fingerprint that is 
analyzed by a computer 
six units have been purchased by the faa for installation at new 
yorks kennedy airport and londons gatwick and 12 others will be 
installed in highrisk airports in the united states and overseas

the following are excerpts of an exclusive 
associated press interview with dissident fang lizhi conducted in 
english at his beijing apartment june 2 just days before he sought 
protection at the us embassy 
the interview was conducted after the declaration of martial law 
in beijing to quell a public uprising for a freer society and one 
day before the peoples liberation army indiscriminately fired on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
q what is your assessment of events in china now 
a these events are very important this is the first time 
students intellectuals and ordinary people know they have the right 
to criticize the government that has never happened before 
q were you surprised by the number of people who joined the 
protest 
a yes i only expected students and intellectuals and a few 
workers but i was very surprised there were so many ordinary people 
who joined that means theyve already approached that stage where 
the people demand political reforms 
q what about the immediate effect 
a in the shortterm i dont think we can easily change a lot 
maybe to change a small step is possible for instance this time we 
can get a little bit of freedom of the press 
q what do you think will happen in the long term 
a in the long term we need the older generation of the 
leadership to go like senior leader deng xiaoping if they 
leave the situation will be better more democracy 
q at a government demonstration two days ago they burned you in 
effigy what is your reaction 
a laughs for me personally its a joke but i should say the 
government doing that is something like 20 years ago when mao 
tsetung set out the red guard that is dangerous 
you know somebody asked me about my safety i think its about 
halfhalf if the government organizes something like the red 
guards then im in danger 
q are you worried about that 
a yeah maybe but i dont think this time will be as easy as 
maos time 
q why have you been quiet during the demonstrations 
a even if i keep quiet the government still says im the head of 
the demonstrations if i join the student demonstrations the 
government can very easily say this demonstration is organized by 
professor fang because chinese leaders say only very few persons 
like professor fang demand democracy demand human rights 
q the government has indicated you are behind the 
demonstrations is this true or false 
a false im never involved in the organization of course i 
have a very strong influence spiritually you know some student 
leaders before the demonstrations often came here since the hunger 
strike that began may 13 theyve never been here the students 
know i completely support them but they dont want to show some 
connection 
q are you concerned another crackdown on intellectuals is coming 
a yes deng and other leaders always want to crack down on 
liberal intellectuals 
q has there been any pressure on you from authorities 
a no direct pressure 
q how about indirect pressure 
a last week i visited shaanxi province for a meeting the 
security members watched me very closely if i took a car two cars 
followed if i took a bus two cars followed even if i went 
sightseeing many security members followed im very honored 
laughs 
q are you afraid youll be arrested before this is over 
a yes i just mentioned a halfhalf possibility 
q are you pessimistic or optimistic about chinas political 
future 
a longterm im still optimistic i think at least after the 
older generation leaves it will get better 
q do you think deng xiaoping has lost prestige because of the 
way this has been handled 
a hes also near his finish he already lost his face

it looks like the dollar has found a solid base said ernst 
pullmann chief trader at deutsche girozentraledeutsche kommunale

a surprisingly large 09 percent increase in us producer prices in 
may that fueled expectations that us interest rates would remain 
high 
other traders said the dollar continued to be supported by 
investors in the far east who were converting assets into 
dollardenominated investments because of the turmoil in china 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins

a british journalist expelled from china said 
today that the officials who seized him while he was covering a 
demonstration in shanghai took his film and refused to let him 
contact the british consulate 
peter newport of independent television news was the first 
journalist expelled from china since the studentled campaign for 
greater freedom began in midapril he was ordered out on saturday 
and flew to hong kong 
after he was expelled shanghai authorities sent a letter to 
diplomatic missions telling them to instruct journalists that they 
cannot cover news in the city without foreign ministry permission 
in beijing a british broadcasting co television reporter today 
said he and his crew were detained sunday while filming brian 
barron said the identity cards and passports of members of the crew 
were confiscated and they were told they should not leave china 
without official authorization 
foreign reporters in beijing must have local government approval 
to report from all areas under martial law meaning all of central 
beijing 
they are also banned from interviewing people on activities that 
violate martial law decrees taking pictures of troops and receiving 
materials prohibited under martial law 
in an telephone interview newport said he was seized while 
videotaping a sitin by about 50 students in front of shanghais 
public security building on saturday he was told he could not 
report on a tourist visa 
newport told the security officials who seized him that he would 
not answer questions until allowed contact with the consulate but 
i was never allowed to contact the british consulate 
he said he was filming the sitin when officers just grabbed me 
by the arms and pulled me past the police lines and the gateway of 
the public security building i got away from them but they came 
after me and dragged me back 
the officers took his passport and asked that he erase his film 
when he did not comply a technician was summoned the officers 
watched the tape erased and they kept it 
newport said he was then taken to another building where a half 
dozen officers questioned him for 75 minutes 
he said officers videotaped and wrote down the conversation and 
had newport sing the written record of the conversation 
they basically said i was going to be treated leniently because 
i had admitted what i had done and i apologized but that i was to be 
expelled from china he said 
newport said reporting in china has become dangerous for all 
involved pointing to the case of abc news 
the us network said sunday that chinese authorities intercepted 
raw footage of an abc interview with a man in beijing broadcast the 
tape on national television and then used it to arrest him for 
rumormongering 
chinese television on saturday broadcast footage of the man 
telling abc that 20000 people were killed in the june 34 assault 
that crushed the prodemocracy uprising in beijing his arrest was 
announced on national television on sunday

the young writers came from the city the 
stories from the country and the modest magazine bridged the gap 
between the two cultures 
there were stories about butchering hogs oneroom schoolhouses 
barnraising canning with grandma and an old mans memories 
now after a threeyear break tales from the general store 
is back in publication and its founder hopes both its readers and 
its writers benefit 
for students i see it as a way to learn to write in a handson 
way said editor ray elliott an urbana high school teacher it 
also provides a valuable service by preserving the history and 
culture of the rural midwest 
tales is printed in the format of a small tabloid newspaper 
it is distributed as an insert to the casey reporter the 
marshall independent the robinson daily news the daily record in 
lawrenceville the martinsville planet the oaklandhindsboro 
prairie sun and the robinson constitution 
elliott also hopes to mail it to the 1000 subscribers in 35 
states who took tales when it was published between 1981 and 1986 
four issues a year will cost 5 individual and corporate 
contributions will be another source of income for the magazine he 
said 
elliott began tales in 1981 while teaching at oak lawn community 
high school in suburban chicago when he took seven students to stay 
at his fathers property near bellair about 200 miles south of 
chicago 
we just camped near the woods no water or electricity he 
recalled we had to take two of them back to the train in 
effingham the second day it was just too primitive 
the others stayed on interviewing and photographing people in 
the area for the first edition of tales 
theyd use a taperecorder and use a lot of peoples exact 
words said elliott then theyd weave in a description of the 
scene the sights the sounds and the smells 
elliotts nonprofit corporation also bought the old bellair 
general store they ate there worked there and brought in local 
people to demonstrate things like chair caning and relate memories 
of the area 
a lot of old people die without telling all the stories from 
their lives and they are lost forever said laurie goering who 
first wrote for tales in 1983 this is a nice way to preserve 
them 
goering who now writes for the chicago tribune once did a story 
about a man who made alcohol from old candy that had been discarded 
by stores she says that elliott is good at working with young 
people because he teaches them that writing is fun 
but eventually donations to tales dried up elliott also left 
his teaching job so he lost his source of student writers 
tales ended in 1986 after its 10th issue 
now with new students and new donations elliott hopes tales 
will broaden its coverage 
well focus on the midwest anything of historical 
significance or cultural interest he said 
the new issue features memories of the tin lizzie the first 
horseless carriage in poem form the struggles of 
champaignurbanas first newspaper publishers who battled unhappy 
advertisers unhappy readers and each other the efforts of the 
small town of oakland to survive and thrive and an essay by a 
recent high school graduate on the death of her little sister 
the sky was dark the day she was buried cynthia cox wrote 
i had to sit in the front of the limousine with the driver because 
i was the one who was able to climb in by myself my face was as 
dark as the day and appeared blank

a maryland woman dubbed robin hud by 
federal investigators claims she embezzled as much as 55 million 
from the department of housing and urban development to give to the 
poor 
hud secretary jack kemp was described sunday as being very 
upset by the losses which according to the washington post could 
reach 10 million in the washington field office alone because of 
extraordinarily lax bookkeeping involving foreclosure sales of 
government property 
kemp ordered hud inspector general paul adams to conduct an 
immediate investigation of the alleged embezzlement in the 
washington office and on friday he placed four employees on leave 
without pay frank keating huds general counseldesignee said in 
an interview sunday 
the new york times said investigations also were under way in hud 
offices in denver houston new orleans and los angeles about 
milliondollar diversions 
marilyn harrell a private escrow agent in maryland whos being 
called robin hud said she was able to divert 55 million 
during a fouryear period to help feed clothe and house the poor 
she said today she realized she was breaking the law and she is 
prepared to go to jail i was amazed it went on as long as it did 
but people kept coming for help and we had access to the monies and 
no one seemed to be particularly concerned she said on abcs 
good morning america 
i figured that as long as i was going to go to jail anyway i 
would help a few people with the time i had left the 46yearold 
temple hills md resident told the times 
charlotte chepaitis who runs a shelter for the homeless in 
baltimore described harrell as a saint she was an answer to many 
hundreds and hundreds of prayers chepaitis said 
in texas escrow agent reba louise lovell already has been 
indicted on charges she embezzled 25 million from the sale of 55 
homes in the dallas area 
a twoyear investigation in the washington office led to an 
inspector generals audit sources close to the probe told the times 
that the losses were a bookkeeping disaster but did not appear 
to result from criminal intent on the part of any department 
officials 
the sources said that in some cases department employees allowed 
checks for as much as 100000 to languish in drawers far beyond the 
point when most banks would cash them for deposit into government 
accounts 
keating said that based upon the news accounts im outraged 
and i know the secretary is extremely upset that acts like this 
could take place although as noted all of them allegedly took place 
prior to him taking office 
keating would not comment directly on harrells claims 
keating said kemp ordered an investigation by the inspector 
generals office and an accounting firm to determine the extent of 
the problem suggest remedies and construct a system which will make 
this kind of conduct infrequent if not impossible in the future 
the fact that in dallas a closing agent could allegedly 
embezzle 2 million and not be noticed the fact that in maryland a 
closing agent could allegedly give 5 million to the poor and not be 
noticed shows serious management deficiencies and the secretary 
intends to see that that conduct does not recur keating said 
the investigation is separate from a congressional inquiry into 
allegations that influencepeddling at hud allowed more than a dozen 
former reagan administration officials to benefit from housing 
programs meant for the poor 
agents such as harrell handle closings for the federal housing 
administration when it sells foreclosed property they are supposed 
to turn over the sales proceeds to the government while keeping a 
small commission 
in 1985 harrell used some of the hud money to cover a 37000 
shortfall in her business she told the times when several months 
passed without an inquiry from hud it became clear to her the 
department was unable to track the millions in dollars in payments 
due from escrow agents she said 
she took more money as much as 55 million by her estimate 
before anyone noticed she said much of the money went to a charity 
she founded called friends of the father and that she rented or 
bought 20 homes and nearly 40 automobiles for the needy 
she told the post in an interview published sunday that some of 
the money may have become mingled into improvements on her home 
that included a swimming pool a 2500 widescreen television and 
renovations to her basement 
her scheme began to unravel last year she said when a hud 
official in the washington field office everett rothschild 
detected the diversion 
rothschild would not comment when contacted sunday he is chief 
of the property disposition division of the washington field office 
keating said rothschild was placed on leave without pay along with 
margaret white who heads the office robert warner director of 
housing management and charles womble a supervisory loan 
specialist 
harrell faces a grand jury investigation in baltimore and says 
she is cooperating with investigators trying to track the diverted 
funds 
christians arent perfect she told the times theyre just

police raid on their school to seize pronorth korea propaganda 
materials riot police also clashed with student protesters in pusan 
in another development president roh taewoo said strikes high 
wage increases and other labor problems are undermining the nations 
economy he appealed to employers and workers to show restraint and 
work together 
the defense minister lee sanghoon told the national assemblys 
defense committee that the 43000 us troops based in south korea 
need to be stationed here for a considerable period of time in the 
future 
lee was responding to a recent proposal by sen carl levin 
dmich for a reduction in us forces in korea to about 10000 
troops 
lee said these conditions must be met prior to a us troop 
pullout 
north korea must renounce any plans to unify the korean 
peninsula by force and an institution must be established to ensure 
peace on the peninsula 
the military balance on the peninsula must be maintained by 
securing a replacement combat capability corresponding to the 
american troop withdrawal 
there must be complete agreement on a us withdrawal reached 
through full consultations between the us and south korean 
governments 
lee said south korea also would need to boost its military 
spending from 5 percent to 8 percent of its gross national product 
over a fiveyear period to build up its own military strength if 
us troops leave 
he said the period of active duty for south korean soldiers would 
need to be extended from 30 months to 50 months 
lee said the government was concerned that some 
sentimentalist south koreans were advocating reunification and 
some nationalistic citizens were demanding us troops be 
withdrawn at the risk of national security 
the minister was referring to dissidents who have called for the 
reunification of south and north korea split since 1945 and a 
pullout of us troops charging that the american military presence 
obstructs reunfication 
us administration officials have said their troops will stay as 
long as they are wanted by south korea

the moral majority is being dismantled after a 
decade of leading religious conservatives out of the political 
wilderness but analysts said the effects of its lobbying efforts 
will endure 
there are those that are saying we are witnessing the end of 
the religious right said the rev richard neuhaus director of 
the center on religion and society in new york i do not think 
this is the beginning of the end to paraphrase churchill this is 
the end of the beginning 
television evangelist jerry falwell founder and chairman of 
moral majority announced sunday that the organization will be 
disbanded aug 31 
the lobbying group which raised 69 million and helped elect 
three republican administrations since its founding in june 1979 
had accomplished its mission of politicizing religious 
conservatives falwell told a meeting of the religion newswriters 
association 
i feel that i have performed the task to which i was called in 
1979 the religious right is solidly in place and like the 
galvanizing of the black church as a political force a generation 
ago the religious conservatives in america are now in for the 
duration he said 
neuhaus a lutheran theologian said moral majoritys ability to 
bring christian fundamentalists out of an isolationist stance and 
into public policy debates was a major development of lasting 
consequence 
while the work of moral majority will go on forever the moral 
majority organization is no longer needed falwell said 
an average of 2 million to 3 million people either donated money 
or subscribed to the organizations newspaper over the last decade 
according to mark demoss a spokesman for falwell 
at its height during the 1984 presidential election the group 
raised 11 million demoss said revenues this year are expected to 
drop to 35 million the organization has a dozen employees in 
washington 
sociologist nancy ammerman said the moral majority served an 
important function for religious conservatives as a kind of 
cultural symbol that they were gaining a place in the american 
political scene 
but the groups passing is typical of social movements in 
general that start out with charismatic leaders such as falwell but 
in the long run need individuals on local boards to put policies in 
place she said 
ive been seeing a movement over the last three or four years 
away from the charismatic leadertype phase into the grassroots 
involvement phase said ms ammerman an assistant professor of 
the sociology of religion at emory university in atlanta 
falwell said the disbanding of the moral majority is part of his 
continued withdrawal from politics to devote more time to his 
ministry at thomas road baptist church and liberty university in 
lynchburg va he resigned as president of moral majority in 
november 1987 
moral majoritys work will be taken over by the lobbying groups 
of religious conservatives it helped pave the way for such as the 
american coalition for traditional values concerned women for 
america the rutherford institute the freedom council and the 
american family association falwell said 
much of the political agenda of the religious right including 
making abortion illegal allowing tuition tax credits for private 
schools and silent prayer in public schools remains unfulfilled 
but falwell credited the moral majority with registering 
millions of voters and leading religious conservatives in 
electing ronald reagan defeating a dozen liberal us senators in 
1980 reelecting reagan in 1984 and electing bush last year 
he said the organization also helped place conservative judges 
throughout the federal courts and successfully lobbied for 
legislation such as the equal access bill which permits studentrun 
religious groups to meet in public schools

in the scarred denuded hills northwest 
of hanoi vietnam is waging another war one scientists say may 
prove as crucial to its survival as those against the french and 
americans 
over large tracts of vinh phu experimental efforts are under way 
to regenerate forests that once covered most of the hilly province 
and to persuade farmers to mix cash crops with trees that bind and 
fertilize the soil 
the lessons learned may help attain a national objective 
increase tree cover in the next few decades from the current 20 
percent to 50 percent vo quy the countrys leading 
conservationist says while the plan may be overambitious not 
succeeding could spell disaster 
according to quy a biologist who helped develop vietnam strategy 
for national conservation forces threatening the underpinnings of 
vietnam are at work 
about 40 percent of the country is being raked by erosion with 
water rushing off denuded hills and carrying away tons of vital 
topsoil agricultural land is already scarce and vietnams 
population now 60 million is growing at 24 percent a year 
this task of restoring our environment is the biggest and most 
important challenge facing vietnam today quy said upon accepting 
an award last year from the switzerlandbased world wildlife fund 
forced for decades to worry about falling bombs and empty rice 
bowls the vietnamese and their neighbors in cambodia and laos 
largely ignored the mounting ecological mayhem around them 
vast forests became firewood and the land was turned into rice 
paddies wildlife was slaughtered by foraging armies and hungry 
civilians in vietnam the united states unleashed a new form of 
warfare chemical defoliation to deny communist guerrillas vital 
forest sanctuaries 
the wars have ended in all but cambodia but peace and a recent 
opening to the outside world pose new dangers eager for rapid 
economic growth but unable to pay for it the three countries find 
that among their most saleable commodities are the remaining forests 
japanese loggers widely criticized for despoiling southeast 
asias tropical forests have already gained a foothold in 
cambodia thailand which banned domestic logging this year after 
ravaging its own forests is hungry for its neighbors timber 
indochinese officials say controls will be placed to prevent 
exploitation by outsiders but their statements sound optimistic in 
light of experiences elsewhere in the third world 
western environmentalists contend that japanese and thai loggers 
will try to buy off anyone who tries to stop them from cutting down 
the forests 
we are destroying our environmental balance said chea kong 
of cambodias agricultural ministry estimating forest cover has 
shrunk from 73 to 50 percent in his country over the past decade 
eradication of flooded forests adjacent cambodias tonle sap 
lake has wiped out many fish breeding grounds and in part accounts 
for the dramatic drop in catch in recent years 
in an unprecedented speech last month prime minister kaysone 
phomvihane of laos said deforestation had reached a dangerous 
level and called for a ban on logging for export he blamed 
drought and floods on the forest felling which he described as a 
crime against the next generation 
in all three countries the large herds of wild animals 
remembered by older residents have vanished tiger elephant gaur 
and gibbon are among the endangered species the sumatran rhinoceros 
and tapir are extinct 
vietnam probably faces the greatest problems since world war ii 
when about half the country was under tree cover the forests have 
dwindled steadily according to the vietnamese about 49 million 
acres of forest were destroyed by herbicides and other us military 
actions 
but since the war ended in 1975 even more woodland has been 
destroyed by human encroachment 
some of vietnams countermeasures appear impressive given the 
shattered economy and little foreign aid for conservation 
quy said more than half a billion trees are being planted each 
year with every student in the country obliged to take part about 
90 parks and conservation areas have been established and a search 
has begun to capture and breed the kouprey an endangered species of 
wild cattle that has become a symbol to conservationists in 
southeast asia 
but across indochina the ax and the gun are hard to stop 
tribespeople in laos strip entire mountainsides through their 
migratory slashandburn farming a tactic that wreaks environmental 
havoc worldwide 
it was easier to mobilize and sacrifice during the war said 
to thinh a district chief in vinh phu it is harder to mobilize 
people to save the environment

the sudanese government and a rebel 
group that has been fighting for autonomy for six years agreed 
conditionally today on a constitutional conference in september to 
end their civil war 
in a joint statement the sides set sept 18 for the start of the 
conference but said it would have to be preceded by full 
implementation of a pending peace agreement 
that agreement was reached in november between the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army and the democratic unionist party a major 
player in sudans coalition government 
the pact caused a schism in the governing coalition and prime 
minister sadek mahdi was forced to reshuffle his government earlier 
this year under pressure from the army and professional groups 
although mahdi has signaled his acceptance of the november peace 
plan sudans parliament still has not formally endorsed it 
the government and the rebel army said they would meet again in 
ethiopias capital on july 4 to discuss ways to implement the 
november accord and pave the way for the september conference 
the joint statement was issued at the end of a twoday 
closeddoor meeting between the sides the first in the 6yearold 
war 
no site was given for the constitutional conference but the 
statement said all sudanese political parties would be invited to 
participate 
it appeared doubtful however that the militant national islamic 
party would agree to take part in such a conference because it is 
firmly opposed to a peace agreement with the sudan peoples 
liberation army 
the islamic party also a dominant partner in the former 
government left mahdis coalition after he indicated acceptance of 
novembers tentative peace accord 
one of the sticking points to formal endorsement of the peace 
proposal was a provision in the agreement calling for abrogation of 
sudans defense pacts with egypt and libya but on sunday the 
government in khartoum unexpectedly announced it had canceled those 
pacts 
in the joint statement the sides agreed that the steps taken 
by the governments of sudan and egypt to abrogate the joint defense 
pact by mutual consent are positive and what remains is its 
ratification by the constituent assembly 
but government and rebel delegations expressed differing views on 
the sudaneselibyan defense protocol with the insurgents 
questioning whether sudan could end it unilaterally without libyas 
consent 
lam akol the sudan peoples liberation armys director of 
external affairs noted that libya has made no mention of the pacts 
abrogation and said it is not clear if one side alone can cancel 
it 
the organization considers the mutual defense agreements an 
infringement on sudanese sovereignity under a 1976 joint defense 
treaty with egypt the countries are to aid each other in case of a 
foreign attack the agreement is onesided in reality because of the 
poor condition of the sudanese army 
libya and sudan signed a military cooperation pact in 1985 but 
that too is onesided with sudan receiving military aid and 
equipment but contributing very little in return 
other points of the november peace initiative which remain to be 
worked out are cancelation of islamic law which are opposed by the 
rebels lifting of a state of emergency and the declaration of a 
permanent truce 
the guerrilla organization launched its rebellion in early 1983 
demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms in the three 
southern provinces of bahr ghazal upper nile and equatoria 
populated mainly by christians and animists

foreign minister moshe arens today 
rejected egypts offer to serve as a mediator with the plo to help 
end the 18monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories 
the offer came in a message to prime minister yitzhak shamir from 
egyptian president hosni mubarak it was delivered in a private 
meeting by the visiting egyptian minister of state for foreign 
affairs butros ghali 
ghali is the only leading egyptian official to visit israel since 
the start of the palestinian uprising 
im ready to be a good and active postman ghali told about 
30 prominent palestinians at a breakfast meeting in herzliya 
after 90 minutes of talks with ghali in jerusalem arens 
responded that there was no need for a middleman and no desire for 
talks with the plo israel refuses to negotiate with the plo 
considering it a terrorist organization 
there is no need for mediation arens said i think the 
egyptians understand that we are convincedthat the peace process 
needs to be advanced through direct negotiations and not through 
mediation 
a senior israeli official who requested anonymity said shamir 
told mubaraks envoy he would welcome egyptian efforts to persuade 
palestinians to accept israels plan for holding elections in the 
west bank and gaza strip the plo has rejected shamirs plan under 
which palestinians would elect nonplo representatives to negotiate 
limited autonomy for the occupied territories 
any positive influence egypt could exert on the palestinians 
here would be beneficial the official quoted shamir as saying 
but he added the plo was not a partner and we dont need 
mediation with them 
asked about differences between the egyptian and israeli stance 
toward the palestine liberation organization arens said that israel 
sees the plo as the major obstacle to progress for peace in the 
area 
it is our position that anything which enhances the image of 
the plo is not a positive development in the peace process arens 
said 
egypt is the only arab country that maintains diplomatic ties 
with israel 
ghali also suggested egypts embassy in tel aviv play a mediating 
role between palestinians and the plo if such a move was requested 
by arabs in the occupied land said radwan abu ayash head of the 
arab journalists association 
several prominent palestinians did not attend the meeting some 
said they received threats from radical plo faction while others 
boycotted the session because it was held in israel instead of in 
arab east jerusalem 
also today the israeli daily haaretz reported the army will 
extend the maximum period under which arabs can be jailed without 
trial from six months to a year currently 1508 palestinians are 
being held without trial in israeli detention centers and 5000 
arabs have been held since the uprising began 
the socalled administrative detention has been strongly 
criticized by the united states as a violation of the right to due 
process before the law

an armed mob in uzbekistan tried to storm a refugee 
camp where minority turks sought safety from ethnic violence but 
troops killed two of the assailants and drove the others off pravda 
reported today 
in other weekend clashes in the central asian republic a soldier 
killed an attacker who tried to grab his gun in the city of 
margilan and a military patrol fatally shot a motorcyclist and 
injured another when one of them fired a sawedoff shotgun in the 
city of kokand the official news agency tass said today both 
incidents occurred sunday 
the government newspaper izvestia said troops killed one attacker 
and injured another in kokand on saturday and shot to death a 
motorist in margilan who refused to stop 
the rampage in the region has claimed the lives of 100 people 
most of them meskhi turks and driven nearly 15000 into primitive 
refugee camps official media say 
more than 9000 interior ministry troops brought into the fergana 
valley have failed to halt attacks by increasingly wellorganized 
and armed gangs of marauders officials said 
authorities have had to airlift hundreds of the refugees out of 
danger 
in a sign of extreme concern about the violence the communist 
partys ruling politburo today dispatched premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
and former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov the partys current top 
lawandorder official to the region tass reported 
col y nechayev of the interior ministry told pravda that about 
400 extremists mounted a column of vehicles saturday evening and 
tried to reach a camp housing almost 2000 meskhi turk refugees in 
the mountains near the city of kokand 1500 miles southeast of 
moscow 
four helicopters full of soldiers landed in their path to stop 
the column and two attackers were killed and five wounded in a 
shootout pravda said the remaining attackers escaped into the 
darkness it added 
all 1990 of the refugees in the attacked camp have been flown to 
safer quarters in the central soviet union pravda said 
the last time soviet troops were reported to have killed 
civilians in a clash with proindependence protesters was in georgia 
on april 9 at least 20 people died in unrest in the southern 
republic georgian activists have said the protesters were unarmed 
but the uzbek mobs are reported to have automatic weapons 
firebombs stones and pitchforks 
reports conflict over the reasons for the prolonged rioting much 
of the violence has been directed against the meskhi turks who were 
forcibly deported to the area from their homeland in georgia in 
1944 but police stations government buildings and stores have also 
been attacked 
interior ministry officials have blamed the attacks on outside 
agitators who came pouring into the valley in cars and trucks 
minister vadim bakatin called them opponents of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms which have included a crackdown on highlevel 
corruption in uzbekistan 
tass said attackers have carried signs with slogans reading 
uzbekistan is for uzbeks get rid of garbage and well 
strangle turks well strangle russians long live the islamic 
banner 
the majority of uzbeks are moslems 
uzbek activists however point to rampant unemployment harsh 
living conditions in the impoverished cottongrowing republic and 
worsening pollution as the deeper causes for the violence 
pravda today said that gangs of bandits not even masquerading

turning away the case of a marine who died 
after his wisdom tooth was pulled the supreme court today left 
intact a legal doctrine that bars members of the military from suing 
over injuries suffered incident to service 
the court without comment refused to reinstate lawsuits against 
the government by the widow of sgt timothy adkins whose death in 
1985 sparked three separate investigations by the marine corps and 
navy 
according to court records adkins 26 died as a result of 
having his tooth pulled in a dental clinic at the marine corps air 
station in beaufort sc 
the tooth was pulled in june 1985 adkins died aug 8 
the suits filed by his widow gala contend that adkins problems 
began because the technician who assisted in the extraction failed 
to realize that the machine used to sterilize the instruments was 
not working 
adkins developed an infection that was treated unsuccessfully 
with penicillin he was hospitalized in beaufort then transferred 
to the charleston sc naval hospital 
reporting on one investigation into adkins death rear adm john 
fetterman jr inspector general of the navy told sen john glenn 
dohio the ultimate responsibility must be borne by a system 
which allowed nonphysician health care providers to admit a patient 
on the serious list and schedule and perform subsequent surgery 
without a medical evaluation by a credentialed physician 
fetterman added sgt adkins was transferred to charleston 
so that a more sophisticated level of care could be delivered and 
this did not occur 
mrs adkins lawsuits were dismissed reluctantly last year by 
us district judge falcon hawkins in charleston who cited a 1950 
supreme court decision shielding the government from lawsuits by 
injured military personnel 
that decision in a case called feres vs us and its sequels 
is known today as the feres doctrine 
it is difficult to imagine a case less ripe for dismissal than 
one in which adkins died after having a tooth pulled but feres 
and its progeny tie the courts hands judge hawkins said 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld his dismissal last 
feb 2 
in the appeal acted on today the justices were urged to use 
adkins case to overrule or limit the application of the feres 
doctrine 
it should be noted that this case involves dental and medical 
care under domestic peacetime conditions the appeal said 
it is to say the least not easy to kill someone by pulling 
their tooth it added the sequence of events flowing from the 
removal of sgt adkins tooth and culminating in his paralysis coma 
and eventual death required the malfeasance misfeasance and 
nonfeasance of medical health care providers from three separate 
military installations 
the supreme court last upheld the feres doctrine in a 1987 
decision in which the justices voted 54 to bar families of military 
personnel killed on duty from suing negligent federal employees who 
took part in the military mission 
led by justice antonin scalia the four dissenters called the 
1950 feres decision a mistake that has caused unfairness and 
irrationality 
the courts fivemember majority in the 1987 case included 
nowretired justice lewis f powell whose seat was filled in 1988 
by justice anthony m kennedy 
congress has considered various amendments to the feres doctrine 
which some members have contended treats members of the armed 
services as second class citizens 
the case is adkins vs us 881776

the supreme court today refused to block the 
extradition to hong kong of a california man accused of falsifying 
accounts while chairman of a bank in the british crown colony 
the court without comment rejected arguments that extraditing 
the former bank official will violate his rights and could subject 
him to additional prosecution when hong kong is returned to chinese 
control in 1997 
lawyers for oen yin choy said the current unrest in china and the 
prospect of civil war there underscore the urgency of his plight 
oen 70 is an indonesian citizen now living in an undisclosed 
location south of san francisco the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals last october turned down his bid to avoid extradition 
the appeals court rejected arguments that forcing oen to return 
to hong kong would violate a treaty between the united states and 
britain 
the treaty bars anyone who is extradited from being turned over 
to a third nation it also prohibits the extradited individual from 
being charged with any offense other than those for which he or she 
has been extradited 
under a 1985 agreement between great britain and china control 
of hong kong will revert to china on july 1 1997 when a 99year 
british lease expires 
the 9th circuit court said even if oen becomes subject to 
chinese authority upon termination of the british lease of 
hong kong he will not have been extradited to china 
oen also said the chinese in violation of the usbritish 
treaty could charge him with additional offenses based on his 
alleged conduct as former chairman of the union bank of hong kong 
but the appeals court said the treaty does not purport to 
include commitments by successor governments or third states 
us prosecutors contend that oen embezzled 267 million that 
was deposited in the union bank from 1975 to 1984 the prosecutors 
said the money was supposed to be placed in accounts outside of hong 
kong to produce tax benefits for the investors 
instead the prosecutors charged the money was used for other 
bank purposes oen approved fictitious loans in 1984 to raise money 
to repay some of the investors according to the prosecutors 
oen noting that hong kong officials have accused him of false 
accounting denied he embezzled the money 
he also said his dueprocess rights were violated by the 
extradition proceeding conducted by us officials 
oen said translations from chinese to english of witness 
statements in his case are unreliable he also said he was 
unlawfully denied the right to crossexamine the governments 
witnesses 
the case is oen vs robinson 881481

two alligators reported missing from the 
local zoo were apparently stolen and the thieves had better keep 
watch on their snapping jaws authorities said today 
they just dont get up in pairs and stroll out said police 
officer judd lezotte 
the 4foot american alligators who live in a new outdoor pen 
were last seen at about midnight saturday by a watchman they were 
discovered missing about eight hours later 
they were in there all week and seemed very happy there said 
gregg cancho acting director of beardsley zoological gardens the 
alligators which are native to the southeast would have had to 
climb a 4foothigh wall to get out an unlikely feat dancho said 
one other possibility would have been for them to go out the 
keepers entrance but theyd have to hop a 3foot wall walk around 
and jump another 3foot wall dancho said 
he said the animals are dangerous and capable of biting off 
fingers the pair was near death three years ago when a local 
resident who had apparently brought them up from the south donated 
them to the zoo

rebels attacked an airport in northern 
afghanistan killing 300 government soldiers during a raid in which 
a large ammunition dump blew up the guerrilla news service said 
today 
the moslem guerrillas known as the mujahedeen or islamic 
holy warriors launched the attack in early june on the airport 
at mazarisharif the insurgents afghan news agency said 
the city is the capital of northern balkh province and a major 
military base of afghanistans sovietbacked government 
during the fighting 7400 tons of ammunition stored in a depot 
exploded destroying weaponry vehicles and 170 tanks the agency 
said it said it was unclear if the arsenal was exploded by the 
rebels or if it was sabotaged to keep weapons out of guerrilla hands 
about 300 government troops were killed in the blast and 
subsequent fighting the agency reported 
it was not possible to independently confirm the guerrilla report 
battlefield claims by each side are difficult to verify and 
casualty counts frequently are released several days after clashes 
mazarisharif 35 miles south of the soviet border is the major 
military supply hub for kabul the afghan capital 
guerrilla and western diplomatic sources say the communist 
government has prepared the city as a fallback position in the event 
kabul is taken by the rebels who are backed primarily by pakistan 
and the united states 
gulbaddin hekmatyar leader of the fundamentalist hezbiislami 
rebel group told civilians sunday to evacuate the southeastern city 
of kandahar afghanistans secondlargest before an imminent 
guerrilla attack 
communist government forces still hold the countrys major cities 
following the withdrawal earlier this year of soviet troops helping 
the marxist government but the guerrilla fighters have control of 
most of the countryside 
a commander in hekmatyars group issued a similar warning to 
kabul citizens in may but the offensive has yet to materialize 
guerrilla sources who demanded anonymity said rebel leaders plan 
to focus their firepower mainly on eastern afghan cities near the 
pakistan border 
capture of a major eastern city would provide a capital for the 
guerrillas governmentinexile and provide them a staging base for 
their ultimate objective kabul 
but jalalabad the guerrillas first target just 40 miles from 
the pakistan frontier remains in government hands despite three 
months of rebel attacks 
the rebels want to rid the country of marxists and establish an 
independent islamic republic of afghanistan they have rejected 
repeated peace overtures from the kabul government 
pakistan which shelters more than 3 million afghan war refugees 
and the united states have announced they will continue supporting 
the guerrillas but with an eye to pursuing a political solution of 
the war 
hardline guerrilla leaders such as hekmatyar along with and 
hawks in islamabad and washington advocate fighting on for a 
military victory

the united nations today flew 150 
namibians back to their homeland at the start of an airlift that 
eventually will bring thousands of refugees home for november 
independence elections 
the passengers mostly women and children arrived on a zambian 
airways dc10 from lusaka zambia after immigration formalities at 
the airport they will be reunited with their families and sent to 
their home villages 
officials say it will cost 39 million to bring the refugees back 
for the election campaign which begins july 1 and the november 
elections both will be held under a unsponsored peace treaty 
granting te namibia independence 
one un official nicolas bwakira said the refugees who 
returned today were in good health and they are all very happy 
many namibians fled their homeland to angola and zambia over the 
years to escape the bush war for control of namibia under a 
regional peace treaty signed in december south africa agreed to end 
its 74year rule of the territory in return for cuba withdrawing its 
estimated 50000 troops from angola where they fought alongside 
government forces 
un officials had expected 1300 refugees to arrive today in 
windhoek and at northern namibian air bases in ondanga and 
grootfontein 
but one flight from luanda angola to grootfontein was 
reportedly canceled and the officials said only 700 arrivals were 
expected today two planes carrying refugees belongings were to 
arrive from angola and zambia 
the first refugee to disembark from the zambian plane was a 
17yearold he was greeted on the tarmac at windhoek international 
airport by bwakira who asked him if he was glad to be back 
im glad to be home yes said the boy 
several of the young men sang freedom songs as they walked toward 
the terminal building the two dozen children on the plane carried 
blankets and orangecolored plates and cups given to them in zambia 
the united nations has registered 41000 namibian exiles most 
of them in angola and zambia who want to return home in addition 
to the airlift hundreds of refugees are crossing the border from 
angola on foot namibian officials have said 
most exiles are supporters or members of the southwest african 
peoples organization which fought a 23year guerrilla war against 
south african control of namibia 
as the zambian airways plane landed 200 people dressed in the 
swapo colors of blue red and green chanted slogans supporting the 
swapo guerrilla fighters 
namibians who turned out to greet the refugees held up banners 
reading welcome home swapo freedom fighters 
swapo is favored to win november elections but they will need a 
twothirds majority in order to control the new government no 
formal date has been set for independence but it will likely be 
early next year 
the arlift was delayed for a month when an unscheduled border 
crossing by hundreds of swapo fighters interrupted the peace plan on 
april 1 the day it was to begin 
more than 300 swapo fighters and 27 security force officials 
died in the subsequent fighting until swapo recalled the fighters 
to angola 
further delays were caused by disagreements over an amnesty for 
exiles accused of crimes before the left and the repeal of 
discriminatory legislation that might affect free and fair elections

companies involved in treating hazardous waste 
today lost a supreme court appeal aimed at forcing the government to 
adopt tougher environmental rules 
the court without comment refused to let the firms sue for 
stricter standards that could increase their business volume or give 
them a competitive advantage over other wastetreatment companies 
the justices instead let stand a ruling that denies the 
companies legal standing to sue in such cases 
the case prompted an unusual alliance between business and 
environmental groups 
the appeal by the hazardous waste treatment council representing 
leading treatment firms and makers of advanced technology treatment 
equipment was supported by such prominent environmental groups as 
the environmental defense fund the national wildlife federation and 
the natural resources defense council 
the environmental groups noting their own limited finances and 
technical capabilities said they welcome legal standing for 
industry groups wishing to fight for whatever motive for a cleaner 
environment 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled against the 
wastetreatment companies last october 
the appeals court said the companies generally may not challenge 
as too lax the rules adopted by the federal environmental protection 
agency for the treatment storage and disposal of hazardous waste 
for example the companies sought stricter deadlines and 
standards for cement kilns used to burn liquid hazardous wastes 
the hazardous waste treatment council said lax epa regulations 
reduce the market for hightech control devices that council members 
make and use the council also said the rules permit the use of 
waste treatment facilities inadequate to protect the environment 
the appeals court said the council may not invoke federal 
environmental law to enlist the governments support for rules that 
would enhance company profits 
also the appeals court said a firm has no common law 
interest much less a constitutional one in having government drive 
business its way or in having government force competitors services 
to be of the same quality and cost as its own 
the appeals court also said permitting companies to sue in such 
cases could have unintended consequences for example requiring 
more advanced recycling techniques ironically could hurt the 
environment by prompting users to substitute more harmful fuels the 
appeals court said 
it said the only time the wastetreatment companies may sue for 
stricter rules is to protect themselves as consumers when they 
purchase recycled oil for their own use for example 
the case is hazardous waste treatment council vs environmental 
protection agency 881532

prime minister sousuke uno peppered with questions 
by parliament about allegations that he paid a geisha to be his 
mistress maintained a steadfast silence today on what he said was a 
personal matter 
uno chosen as japans prime minister less than two weeks ago 
because of his scandalfree background repeatedly said he would not 
comment in parliament on the charges 
this problem is a private problem not one to discuss in this 
kind of setting uno 66 answered one of three people who 
questioned him about the matter in a session of the lower house 
budget committee 
last week the magazine sunday mainichi broke with japanese 
journalistic tradition and published a story quoting an anonymous 
40yearold woman as saying uno paid her 300000 yen about 2100 
a month for four months in 1985 to be his mistress 
the magazines editorinchief shuntaro torigoe said he decided 
to print the article about the prime ministers private life because 
he wanted to raise the issue of social ethics in politics 
questioners from the socialist democratic socialist and 
communist parties pressed uno today to answer questions about the 
story and said reports of the case were damaging japans 
international reputation 
at first japanese newspapers and television stations gave little 
coverage to the sunday mainichi report but article in overseas 
newspapers and the unprecedented questioning of uno about the report 
by a socialist lawmaker in parliament on friday prompted a stream of 
stories and attempts by a host of reporters to confirm the account 
japanese news reports today said the governing liberal democratic 
party was worried the issue would cost it votes especially among 
women in an election for half of parliaments upper house this 
summer 
the party still is attempting to recover from the recruit co 
bribery scandal that forced former prime minister noboru takeshita 
and three cabinet members to resign and plunged the partys 
popularity to alltime lows 
several prominent officials or their aides were accused of 
purchasing stock in a recruit subsidiary at low prices then making 
handsome profits when the stock went public recruit also allegedly 
attempted to influence officials with campaign donations 
eiichi nakao chairman of the budget committee chastised the 
questioners today for not following provisions in the parliament law 
that forbid impolite and personal questions 
this is not a personal matter said mitsuo higashinaka a 
communist lawmaker everywhere in the world there are standards 
for the morals of politicians 
the sunday mainichi quoted the woman as saying uno was 
selfish and bullied the woman who ran the geisha house where 
she worked 
he is not a man of noble character she was quoted as saying 
he thinks he can buy woman for money i dont want him to use 
politics in the same way he treated me 
the woman said uno broke off the relationship but still wanted to 
be able to meet her for a fee the magazine said 
despite their reputation overseas real geishas are not 
prostitutes but highly trained entertainers versed in the arts and 
in conversation most work in traditional japanese restaurants 
where a majority of the guests are male and some may become the 
mistresses of favored patrons

a jury choosing between the death penalty and a 
life prison term for a convicted murderer generally may not be told 
about the victims personal characteristics the supreme court ruled 
today 
by a 54 vote the justices ruled that a south carolina murderer 
unfairly was sentenced to death after a prosecutor told jurors that 
the victim was a religious communityminded person 
the decision marked a second key setback in the nations highest 
court for the socalled victims rights movement which seeks to 
have sentencing courts take into account a crimes impact on the 
victim and his or her family 
writing for the court today justice william j brennan said a 
defendants sentence whether the death penalty or not cannot be 
based on factors of which the defendant was unaware 
brennans opinion relied heavily on the courts 1987 decision in 
which victim impact statements were barred from sentencing 
trials 
the courts four dissenters in the south carolina case decided 
today however said they are ready to overturn the 1987 decision 
justice byron r white a dissenter in the 1987 case proved to 
be the decisive vote in the south carolina case as he sided with 
brennan 
justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul 
stevens completed the courts majority 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy dissented 
demetrious gathers was convicted of a 1986 killing in a 
charleston sc city park he killed richard haynes 32 during an 
attack in which haynes was beaten and stabbed 
at gathers sentencing trial a state prosecutor focused on 
haynes characteristics the prosecutor in his closing argument 
told jurors that among the things found at the murder scene were 
various religious items and a voter registration card belonging to 
haynes 
we know from the proof that haynes was a religious person 
he believed in this community he took part the prosecutor 
said 
the south carolina supreme court said those statements deprived 
gathers of a fair sentencing trial and todays decision upheld that 
ruling 
the fact that gathers scattered haynes personal papers around 
his body while going through them looking for something to steal was 
certainly a relevant circumstance of the crime and thus a proper 
subject for comment brennan said 
but the prosecutors argument in this case went well beyond 
that fact he read to the jury at length from the religious tract 
the victim was carrying and commented on the voter registration 
card brennan said 
the content of these cards cannot possibly have been relevant 
to the circumstances of the crime brennan said 
the case is south carolina vs gathers 88305

an evenly divided supreme court today upheld a 
federal government decision that effectively expanded indian water 
rights at the fort mohave reservation in arizona and california 
by a 44 vote the justices automatically affirmed a federal 
appeals court ruling that threw out challenges by officials from 
both states 
justice thurgood marshall did not participate in the case for 
unannounced reasons announcement of the 44 vote came in a 
onesentence opinion 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in 1987 ruled that the us 
department of the interior correctly added 3500 acres to the 
reservation an action that had the effect of increasing the 
reservations share of water from the colorado river 
joining the two state governments in challenging that ruling were 
the metropolitan water district of southern california and the 
coachella valley water district in california 
both water districts are run by public corporations that store 
and deliver water to other public agencies for municipal and 
residential use 
the state and water district officials said the adjustment of the 
reservations boundaries illegally deprived them of their fair share 
of colorado river water 
they said the amount of water at stake is enough to serve about 
500000 people for a year 
the 9th circuit court ruled that the federal government is immune 
from being sued in federal courts in this case 
to allow this suit would permit third parties to interfere with 
the governments discharge of its responsibilities to indian tribes 
in respect to the lands it holds in trust for them the appeals 
court had ruled 
the case is california vs us 871165

a 4yearold has become the fifth 
florida youngster shot this month while they or companions played 
with guns but an aide said the governor was reluctant to put a 
gunsafety bill before the legislature this week 
silvio pierre was listed in very critical condition at tampa 
general hospital today after shooting himself in the chest sunday 
police and hospital officials said hospital spokesman marc kutash 
said the boy was in surgery for nearly seven hours 
the child had found his fathers 25caliber pistol under a couch 
while playing in the familys apartment said police cpl gary 
bradford he said the father clotaire pierre of tampa was being 
interviewed but no charges had been filed 
two of the recent shooting victims died last week when the 
number of shootings reached four rep harry jennings resubmitted a 
gunsafety bill that calls for prison terms for people who fail to 
keep loaded guns out of the reach of children 
jennings asked gov bob martinez to include his legislation on 
his agenda if he called a special session on a plan to expand 
floridas turnpike 
martinez who was expected to announce a session decision early 
this week said saturday he would consider it but doubted he would 
widen the sessions scope so lawmakers wouldnt be diverted from the 
turnpike issue 
sundays shooting may not have changed that said jon peck the 
governors press secretary hell certainly give it additional 
thought and he was considering it before that doesnt mean hes 
going to do it 
i do know that he is deeply concerned about all these shootings 
and recognizes that the primary responsibility rests with parents to 
keep their guns out of the way peck said 
the house passed jennings bill during the last session but the 
senate didnt take it up 
under the bill leaving a firearm in a place accessible to a 
child would be a misdemeanor the offense would be a felony if the 
person who made the gun available was negligent and the child died 
or was permanently disfigured the bill would require that guns be 
secured with a trigger lock or stored in a locked container 
earlier this month a 10yearold orlando boy was killed by a 
playmate an 8yearold miramar girl was killed by her 13yearold 
brother who thought his fathers gun was unloaded a 4yearold 
orlando girl was wounded in the neck when her 6yearold brother 
dropped a pistol and a 9yearold tampa boy was wounded by his 
13yearold brother as they played with a handgun 
linda booz a spokeswoman for the florida department of law 
enforcement said statistics on such shootings are generally not 
kept by her agency so no one could say for sure if the spate of 
child shootings was as unusual as it seemed 
the only thing we would have would be negligent manslaughter 
she said that would not include accidental shootings

the supreme court in a major setback for 
affirmative action today expanded the ability of white men to 
challenge courtapproved plans giving preferential treatment to 
minorities and women in government jobs 
by a 54 vote the justices handed civil rights advocates their 
latest defeat in the case of white birmingham ala firefighters 
who say they are victims of reverse discrimination 
the justices said an affirmative action plan agreed to by public 
officials and approved in court may be attacked even years later in 
a new suit by workers who took no part in the case leading to the 
original agreement 
todays ruling marks the third time this year a newly solidified 
high court conservative majority has dealt a significant blow to 
efforts aimed at helping minorities and women overcome bias 
the court in january ruled that state and local governments 
generally may not impose racial quotas for public works projects on 
june 5 the justices erected new barriers for minorities seeking to 
prove with statistics that they are relegated to lower paying less 
desirable jobs 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court 
dismissed arguments that the ruling threatens voluntary settlement 
of minority employment discrimination claims 
a voluntary settlement in the form of a court consent decree 
between one group of employees and their employer cannot possibly 
settle voluntarily or otherwise the conflicting claims of another 
group of employees who do not join in the agreement he said 
a judgment or decree among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues 
as among them but it does not conclude the rights of strangers to 
those proceedings he said 
in a dissenting opinion justice john paul stevens said the 
ruling could have serious consequences for affirmative action plans 
agreed to by employers 
the decision would subject large employers who seek to comply 
with the law by remedying past discrimination to a neverending 
stream of litigation and potential liability stevens said 
he said the ruling threatens to undo efforts by birmingham which 
has made a substantial step toward the eradication of the long 
history of pervasive racial discrimination that has plagued its fire 
department 
stevens was joined by justices william j brennan harry a 
blackmun and thurgood marshall 
joining rehnquist were justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
in other action the court 
ruled that a jury choosing between the death penalty and a life 
prison term for a convicted murderer generally may not be told about 
the victims personal characteristics 
by a 54 vote the justices ruled that a south carolina murderer 
unfairly was sentenced to death after a prosecutor told jurors that 
the victim was a religious communityminded person 
agreed to decide whether manufacturers legally may give some 
discounts to wholesalers but not retailers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by texaco inc ordered to 
pay 138 million in antitrust damages to 12 service stations in the 
spokane wash area 
turned down an appeal by companies involved in treating 
hazardous waste aimed at forcing the government to adopt tougher 
environmental rules 
the court without comment refused to let the firms sue for 
stricter standards that could increase their business volume or give 
them a competitive advantage over other wastetreatment companies 
rejected an appeal by an aspirin manufacturer being sued for 
10 million by the parents of a child who contracted reyes syndrome 
the court without comment let stand a wisconsin judges order 
that the maker of bayer aspirin reveal numerous company records 
made it easier to recover lawyers fees for people who win 
disputes with the government over social security benefits 
by a 54 vote the court said the government must reimburse legal 
fees incurred during administrative proceedings that a federal court 
has ordered the department of health and human services to conduct 
refused to let montana sheep owners kill grizzly bears 
threatening their herds 
the court over one dissenting vote rejected arguments that the 
owners have a constitutional right to protect their property even 
if it means killing animals designated an endangered species 
turned away the case of a marine who died after his wiscom 
tooth was pulled and left intact a legal doctrine barring members 
of the military from suing over injuries suffered incident to 
service 
the court without comment refused to reinstate lawsuits against 
the government by the widow of marine sgt timothy adkins whose 
death in 1985 sparked three separate investigations by the marines 
and navy 
the birmingham case began in 1974 when city officials and the 
jefferson county personnel board were sued by the national 
association for the advancement of colored people and blacks 
charging racial bias in the city fire department 
eventually both sides reached agreement on an extensive plan that 
includes longterm and interim goals for hiring blacks as 
firefighters and promoting blacks to higher ranks the plan also 
included provisions to help women advance 
the birmingham firefighters association opposed the plan but its 
objections were rejected by a federal judge who issued consent 
decrees in 1981 approving the agreement 
at the time the citys 453 firefighters included 42 blacks none 
of the departments 140 lieutenants captains or battalion chiefs 
was black 
seven white firefighters then challenged the promotion plan 
saying lessqualified blacks were being promoted ahead of them 
a federal judge ruled that the white firefighters were bound by 
the court consent decree and dismissed their suit 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals in late 1987 
reinstated the suit sparking an appeal to the supreme court by the 
city and county officials and those who filed the 1974 suit 
in a similar case last year the justices split 44 in upholding 
a new york city affirmative action plan for promoting more blacks 
and hispanics in the city 
kennedy the courts newest member did not participate in that 
case 
the former reagan administration sided with the white birmingham 
firefighters even though the justice department had joined in the 
1974 suit on the side of those alleging bias against minorities the 
governments position was staked out prior to the bush 
administration taking office 
the case is martin vs wilks 871614

the supreme court today made it easier to 
recover lawyers fees for people who win disputes with the 
government over social security benefits 
by a 54 vote the court said the government must reimburse legal 
fees incurred during administrative proceedings that a federal court 
has ordered the department of health and human services to conduct 
the decision is a victory for elmer hudson an alabama woman who 
won disability benefits in a dispute with the government 
justice sandra day oconnor in her opinion for the court said 
requiring the award of legal fees in such cases is in keeping with a 
federal law the equal access to justice act giving lawyers an 
incentive to represent the needy 
the law demands reimbursement of legal fees for more than just 
court proceedings she said 
we find it difficult to ascribe to congress an intent to throw 
the social security claimant a lifeline that it knew was a foot 
short said oconnor 
she was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
dissenting were chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
white in an opinion joined by the other dissenters said the 
court misread the law 
our duty is to apply statutes as they were enacted by congress 
not to take it upon ourselves to overcome the political realities 
that blocked what we might consider to be good legislation he 
said 
the case began when mrs hudson filed a social secuirty 
disability claim in september 1981 she said a variety of physical 
and emotional ailments prevented her from continuing to work as a 
maid and janitor 
an administrative law judge of the health and human services 
agency denied her claim ruling that none of mrs hudsons ailments 
was so severe as to render her disabled 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals overruled the decision in 
1985 the appeals court said mrs hudsons impairments must be 
considered in combination and sent the case back to the health and 
human services agency 
an administrative law judge then determined she was disabled 
since may 1981 and granted her benefits 
the 11th circuit court last year said the government now must 
reimburse mrs hudson for attorneys fees she incurred during the 
second round of administrative proceedings 
the former reagan administration before it left office in 
january asked the supreme court to reverse the appeals court ruling 
justice department lawyers argued that the administrative 
proceedings ordered by the 11th circuit court were not adversarial 
in the way that court proceedings are and therefore said legal fees 
should not be recoverable 
the case is sullivan vs hudson 88616

a twinengine plane with 11 people aboard 
disappeared on what was to have been an hourlong tour of the 
hawaiian islands and searchers used helicopters and boats to look 
for the plane the coast guard said today 
the us coast guard cutter point harris searched overnight 
through the channel separating hawaii island and maui island for the 
scenic air tour hawaii plane that disappeared sunday afternoon 
the coast guard was concentrating its search for the plane off 
the northeast coast of hawaii island the last confirmed location of 
the airplane said coast guard spokesman petty officer robert 
bennett 
bennett said the coast guard received information from federal 
aviation administration radar tapes confirming the twinengine 
beechcraft had left hilo international airport on the east side of 
hawaii island and headed up the islands northeast coast 
the last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an faa 
ground station that he had taken off from hilo for mauis kahului 
airport said the faas george harvey 
the plane was to have toured hawaii island including erupting 
kilauea volcano before flying on to maui said david tom a scenic 
air tours hawaii reservationist in honolulu 
tom who declined to identify the pilot said the 10 passengers 
aboard the plane had set out earlier sunday from honolulu on oahu 
island he said they were probably tourists 
search efforts sunday included a coast guard c130 search and 
rescue plane and a helicopter two helicopters provided by the maui 
fire department and four scenic air tour hawaii planes said bennett 
civil air patrol planes and a coast guard helicopter were to join 
the search when it resumed this morning bennett said

the pilot was known to fly over during tours bennett said hilo 
police sgt prentiss morino said ground searches sunday turned up 
nothing and police were to resume looking later today

the supreme court today refused to let montana 
sheep owners kill grizzly bears threatening their herds 
the court over one dissenting vote rejected arguments that the 
owners have a constitutional right to protect their property even 
if it means killing animals designated an endangered species 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
the case stemmed from an incident involving richard christy who 
owned 1700 head of sheep grazing on land near glacier national park 
in montana 
christy said that in july 1982 bears began attacking his herd on 
a nightly basis 
a herder employed by christy had only limited success in 
frightening the bears away with fires and by shooting into the air 
christy also sought help from kenneth wheeler a trapper working 
for the us fish and wildlife service wheeler set snares to 
capture the bears but by july 9 1982 bears had killed about 20 
sheep worth at least 1200 
that night christy fatally shot a grizzly after it emerged from 
the forest and moved toward his herd 
two weeks later having lost 84 sheep to the bears christy 
removed his herd from the land he had leased from the blackfeet 
indian tribe the tribe refunded money christy paid them to lease 
the land christy said he was forced to sell the flock at slaughter 
value and lost more than 10000 
the department of the interior fined christy 2500 for violating 
the federal endangered species act grizzlies are protected under 
the law 
christy then sued the government claiming the law 
unconstitutionally deprived him of his property he was joined by 
two other sheep owners thomas guthrie and ira perkins of teton 
county mont 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last september upheld a 
federal judges ruling dismissing the suit 
we decline plaintiffs invitation to construe the fifth 
amendment as guaranteeing the right to kill federally protected 
wildlife in defense of property the appeals court said 
the fifth amendment to the constitution bars the government from 
confiscating private property without just compensation 
the appeals court said the endangered species act reasonably 
requires livestock owners to seek help from the government rather 
than leaving every individual free to kill a nuisance bear whenever 
he or she deems it necessary 
the sheep owners said the regulation is unreasonable because as 
in christys case when the government is incapable of helping there 
is no recourse for them 
they also argued that the law is irrational because it permits 
sportsmen to kill up to 25 grizzlies annually in some designated 
areas 
but the 9th circuit court said that rule is reasonable because it 
is a carefully controlled seasonal hunt aimed at reducing 
regional overpopulation of grizzlies 
the appeals court said the sheep owners contend that by 
protecting grizzly bears the department of interior has 
transformed the bears into governmental agents who have physically 
taken the plaintiffs property 
undoubtedly the bears have physically taken the plaintiffs 
property but the plaintiffs err in attributing such takings to the 
government the appeals court said 
the appeal acted on today was supported by among others the 
american farm bureau federation the national cattlemens 
association the american sheep industry and sheep owners in 
colorado idaho and wyoming 
the case is christy vs lujan 881461

karen guerrillas held off a fierce 
burmese assault on a jungle stronghold near the thai border today 
and 80 burmese troops were killed in the battle rebel sources said 
heavy fighting was reported after 1500 burmese troops met with 
stiff resistance as they battled 700 guerrillas in the pa loo rebel 
camp 
shells and mortar rounds rained down on the camp beginning early 
today but the shooting diminished as evening fell 
burmese troops also attacked pa loo on sunday the camp is eight 
miles from the thai border town of mae sot 
some karens who reported the casualties fled to thailand to 
escape the fighting there were no reports of rebel casualties or 
any independant verification of the number of troops killed 
karens are the largest of a dozen ethnic rebel groups that have 
fought for greater autonomy from rangoon for about 40 years 
that automony was promised to them under burmas constitution 
after independence was won from great britain in 1948 
thai border police speaking on condition of anonymity said 
burmese troops crossed into thailand this morning and attacked thai 
positions near the village of mae kong khen just south of mae sot 
a thai soldier was seriously wounded in a firefight three buddhist 
monks were also reported hurt as more than 100 burmese shells landed 
inside thai territory police said 
by evening police said about 50 burmese troops who had been 
attempting to attack pa loo from behind remained inside thailand at 
mae kong khen pinned down between thai and karen lines and 
prevented by both sides from moving 
the karen sources who demanded anonymity said they were 
confident of withstanding the burmese assault 
thai police said 2000 karen guerrillas and burmese civilians 
fled into thialand on saturday as government troops seized control 
of areas near pa loo 
karen sources said 22 burmese soldiers and six rebels were killed 
in fighting around pa loo between june 1 and june 10 another 31 
government troops were wounded as were 13 karens they said 
fighting has raged in parts of the karen state bordering thailand 
since the burmese army began an intensive campaign to crush the 
insurgency in october 
with larger forces and superior firepower government forces have 
overrun five major karen camps since december these setbacks have 
severely disrupted the crossborder trade that finances the 
insurgency 
recent burmese battle successes have partly been attributed to 
the thai army allowing burmese troops to enter thailand and attack 
karen bases from behind rebels contend but thailand last month 
protested a largescale incursion by between 400 and 600 burmese 
troops who burned a village marketplace during an attack on the 
karen camp at kaw moo ra on may 20 
burma expressed regret over the incident but asked thailand not 
to permit insurgents to take refugee on the thai side of the border 
thailand has strengthened trade links with burma since the 
military took power in rangoon in september and is anxious to ensure 
the smooth flow of official trade across the frontier

authorities today banned the student and worker 
groups that spearheaded the prodemocracy movement and stepped up 
criticism of the united states for sheltering leading dissident fang 
lizhi 
the government on sunday ordered the arrests of fang and his 
wife li shuxian an assistant professor at beijing university for 
what authorities said were counterrevolutionary activities 
the two prominent dissidents sought refuge in the us embassy in 
beijing after the june 4 military attack on students in tiananmen 
square 
in washington the bush administration indicated it would not 
turn the couple over to chinese authorities a us official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity indicated that any attempt to 
arrest fang and li would be resisted 
as a result of the armys assault on unarmed protesters in the 
square uschinese relations have plunged to perhaps the lowest 
point since diplomatic ties were restored a decade ago 
the governmentcontrolled media today accused the voice of 
america which reported hundreds of deaths in the city center a week 
ago of false reporting and distortion official media claim no one 
was killed on the square 
authorities have launched a propaganda campaign aimed at 
convincing the populace that soldiers were the victims of a 
rampaging mob and that foreign reports of troops opening fire on 
unarmed crowds are lies 
official media told people to study senior leader deng xiaopings 
speech friday that praised the army for crushing the 7weekold 
prodemocracy movement deng claimed the movements leaders intended 
to turn communist china into a capitalist republic 
national television repeatedly showed scenes of one man 
identified as a leader of an independent labor union in shanghai 
who had apparently been beaten and was being held at gunpoint by 
police 
his face was swollen so badly he could barely open his eyes 
broadcasts also showed the arrests of dozens of other people 
many described as thugs who took advantage of the movement to 
commit crimes during protests that hit more than a dozen chinese 
cities 
the propaganda assault and heavy troop presence in beijing have 
ended nationwide protests that broke out after the capital was 
occupied by troops 
the ministry of public security announced in a notice read today 
on beijing radio that all illegal organizations which incite or 
create social disturbances and counterrevolutionary rebellion are 
banned 
it said those leaders who refuse to surrender will be arrested 
brought to justice and dealt with severely 
many student leaders appear to have gone underground 
authorities have arrested about 750 people mainly workers and 
unemployed youths in beijing shanghai chengdu wuhan lanzhou and 
guiyang there have also been arrests in xian canton changsha 
zhengzhou and other cities 
the attacks on the us governmentfunded voa intensified today 
with the official beijing daily running an editorial that was read 
on television 
voa really has created too many rumors it said theyve 
done enough to add fuel to the flames of the counterrevolutionary 
turmoil 
the editorial continued beijing is returning to order and the 
people are settling down voa also should take a rest 
the government also criticized the us embassy for harboring 
fang and li 
the official xinhua news agency said fang and his wife were 
charged with committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda 
and instigation in connection with the prodemocracy protests 
the foreign ministry strongly protested the sheltering of fang 
and official media have repeatedly demanded that the outspoken 
critic of marxism be turned over to authorities 
china also has lashed out at the united states for banning 
military sales in china in response to the june 4 assault the 
chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed mostly 
soldiers however chinese witnesses and western intelligence said 
the toll could be as high as 3000 most of them civilians 
the only comparable strain on uschinese relations since formal 
ties were reestablished in 1979 has been the question of 
washingtons ties with taiwan the nationalist chineseruled island 
beijing considers a renegade province 
abc quoted chinese sources sunday as saying police arrested ren 
wanding a leading dissident and accountant who had written essays 
criticizing the communist government 
like fang ren did not play a leading role in the recent student 
demonstrations but voiced support for their goals 
the british foreign office today said it had asked chinas 
foreign ministry to look into the case of a hong kong student who 
was arrested in shanghai as he was about to board a flight to go 
home to the british colony 
yao yongzhan 19 was in the company of several british students 
and british consulate officials when he was detained at the airport 
shanghai authorities said yao headed an independent shanghai 
student group in beijing foreign reporters must have local 
government approval to report from all areas under martial law

here is a transcript of president bushs speech 
monday on his clean air proposals 
thank you all very much 
thank you 
thank you very much 
please governors 
well in this room are republicans and democrats leaders from 
both sides of the aisle in congress governors executives from some 
of the most important companies and business organizations in 
america leading conservationists and people who have devoted their 
lives to creating a cleaner and safer environment 
and ive invited you here today to make a point with the 
leadership assembled in this room we can break the stalemate that 
has hindered progress on clean air for the past decade and with the 
minds the energy the talent assembled here we can find a solution 
so let me tell you the purposes of this mornings gathering 
first id like to lay on the table my proposals to curb acid 
rain and cut urban smog and clean up air toxics 
and second i want to call upon all of you to join me in enacting 
into law a new clean air act this year 
but first we should remember how far weve come and recognize 
what works 
the 1970 clean air act got us moving in the right direction with 
national air quality standards that were strengthened by amendments 
in 1977 
since 1970 even though we have 55 percent more cars going 50 
percent farther in spite of more utility output and more industrial 
production we still made progress 
lead concentrations in the air we breathe are down 98 percent 
sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide cut by over a third particulate 
matter cut 21 percent even ozonecausing emissions have been cut 
by 17 percent 
and still over the last decade we have not come far enough 
too many americans continue to breathe dirty air and political 
paralysis has plagued further progress against air pollution 
we have to break this logjam by applying more than just federal 
leverage 
we must take advantage of the innovation energy and ingenuity 
of every american 
the environmental movement has a long history here in this 
country 
its been a force for good for a safer healthier america 
and as a people we want and need that economic growth but now 
we must also expect environmental responsibility and respect the 
natural world 
and this will demand a national sense of commitment a new ethic 
of conservation and i reject the notion that sound ecology and a 
strong economy are mutually exclusive 
so last week i outlined five points of a new environmental 
philosophy 
one to harness the power of the marketplace two to encourage 
local initiative three to emphasize prevention instead of just 
cleanup four to foster international cooperation and five to 
ensure strict enforcement polluters will pay 
we know more now than we did just a few years ago 
new solutions are close at hand

vice president dan quayle underscored us 
insistence that panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega step down 
soon and urged guatemalan leader to promote that goal bush 
administration officials said today 
guatemalan government officials told quayle in a meeting sunday 
night about a new organization of american states plan to pressure 
noriega from power but administration sources said us officials 
are worried that the military chief may try to hang on while a 
national reconciliation effort in panama is under way 
quayle met with guatemalan foreign minister mario palencia on the 
eve of palencias departure today for panama as part of an oas team 
that is seeking to negotiate a solution to the panamanian quagmire 
palencia told quayle there was a new plan a new formula that 
was being applied in the thus far unsuccessful effort to remove 
noriega who has been indicted by us grand juries on 
drugtrafficking charges said an official traveling with quayle 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity declined to 
give specifics of that plan other than to say it would provide for 
deposing noriega and installing a democratically elected government 
one official told reporters that quayle was interested in the 
proposal but was insistent on the us position that noriega must 
step down at once and preferably leave panama that means noriega 
would not be allowed to remain while his countrys politicians 
engaged in reconciliation dialogue 
quayle reiterated that point this morning to a group of 
guatemalan political and community leaders saying our bottom 
line is that noriega must leave not only from power but also it is 
our position that he should leave the country 
the vice president also discussed with the guatemalans further 
steps that might be taken regarding panama should the oas effort 
fail part of the purpose of his threeday fournation trip to 
central america is to sound out us allies on initiatives they 
might take to further the antinoriega effort 
the possibility was discussed that noriega might go to a country 
that does not have extradition agreements with the united states and 
thus avoid having to face drug indictment charges in florida one 
official said 
but he added that we dont have anything in writing from any 
countries offering to take noriega 
in his meeting sunday night quayle also asked guatemalas 
defense chief hector alejandro gramajo to relay to panamanian 
military forces president bushs position that it is noriega the 
united states opposes not the panamanian defense force he heads 
bush has urged the panamanian military as well as the countrys 
citizens to rise up and oust noriega 
quayle later met with guatemalan president vinicio cerezo 
flying here sunday quayle told reporters aboard air force two 
that he will tell contra field commanders that they should consider 
dropping their fight against leftistruled nicaragua and returning 
home peacefully 
we are clearly on a diplomatic and political course with 
regard to nicaragua he said i will lay out the option to them 
about the possibility of returning to nicaragua as envisioned in 
bushs 49 million package of nonlethal aid to the usbacked 
contras 
bush and congress agreed that the us money can be used for 
repatriation of the contras while the presidents of the five central 
american countries negotiate toward free elections in nicaragua next 
february 
quayle was skeptical that nicaraguan president daniel ortega will 
fulfill his promise to hold fair elections 
nonetheless quayle said he will talk with the contras about the 
possibility that they might want to return and take part in the 
nicaraguan political process he meets the contras on tuesday in 
honduras 
the 11000member contra army is camped in honduras near the 
nicaraguan border but quayle will meet with the commanders and 
possibly their military leader enrique bermudez in the capital of 
tegucigalpa 
quayle said his reservations about ortega shouldnt be taken by 
the contras as a signal to hold on for the possibility of renewed 
us military aid 
the democraticcontrolled congress has blocked more military aid 
and that isnt likely to change he agreed 
speaking of the possibility of the contras returning home quayle 
said im certainly going to lay that out as an option and if 
they feel comfortable they should be encouraged to go back 
but he added i dont think it would be proper for me to say 
this is your only option 
the vice president said nicaraguas leadership doesnt appear to 
be moving toward free elections 
of the contra commanders quayle said i dont have to tell them 
what danny ortegas track record is 
us officials say they have evidence that nicaragua is still 
supplying weapons to leftist rebels in el salvador in violation of 
regional peace agreement signed by ortega 
quayle said the focus of his trip in addition to discussing the 
panama question will be to spotlight regional democracy and to 
get involved on a substantive basis with the presidents before 
they and ortega meet again in july for more work on their peace plan 
regarding the latter mission quayle said he intended to discuss 
us objections to the allpowerful electoral commission formed by 
the sandinistas to oversee the elections the administration claims 
the membership is stacked in favor of the sandinistas putting 
opposition candidates at a disadvantage

researchers have a deal new mothers cant 
refuse free disposable diapers in exchange for dirty ones 
honest says constance kies professor of human nutrition at the 
university of nebraskalincoln 
her department is looking for about 40 pregnant women who will 
deliver sometime this fall so they can immediately enroll their 
babies and their diapers in the fiveday program to analyze 
nutrition 
its not invasive we do not intrude upon the babies lives at 
all kies said all we want are their dirty diapers 
the diapers and their contents will be used by graduate students 
to study levels of manganese in bottlefed and breastfed babies and 
potassium and sodium levels in diabetic and nondiabetic mothers and 
in their infants 
the analysis of the data is pretty straightforward kies 
said the obtaining of the subjects and the raw material is pretty 
laborintensive 
to get a proper sample the students need about 10 dirty diapers 
from each baby each day at least 400 diapers per day or 2000 dirty 
diapers in all 
i understand that new moms go through a tremendous amount of 
diapers so we figured they could use some free ones kies said 
collecting the diapers from homes is pretty simple but 
arrangements have to be made with the hospitals where the babies are 
born to save the diapers as well 
normally they want to get rid of them as fast as they can

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
arrived today for his first state visit to west germany and held 
talks with chancellor helmut kohl that reportedly focused on arms 
reductions 
gorbachev met with kohl for more than an hour at the chancellors 
office in talks that concerned president bushs may 29 proposal to 
cut conventional arms in europe west german television reported 
a west german government spokesman manfred oblaender said the 
initial round of talks was more substantial and intense than 
expected and that it had been extended he would not elaborate 
a wedge of motorcycle police led the soviet leaders black 
limousine to the chancellors office and gorbachev waved from the 
open car window to a crowd of 100 people some of whom had stood in 
the hot afternoon sun for nearly an hour 
friedbert pflueger a spokesman for west german president richard 
von weizsaecker said an earlier onehour meeting between the 
weizsaecker and gorbachev focused on political and private subjects 
he said that gorbachev also discussed the new nato arms control 
proposals with weizsaecker the titular west german head of state 
in preparation for a joint statement by the two governments he did 
not elaborate 
the soviet president came to strengthen ties between east and 
west an objective that goes to the heart of this divided nation 
i arrived with the best feelings and with the wish to do 
everything so that our relationship and cooperation can develop 
further gorbachev said in a brief exchange with television 
reporters at the state residence villa hammerschmidt 
im using the opportunity of this first interview to wish the 
citizens of the federal republic health and wellbeing he told 
west germanys zdf tv 
much of gorbachevs visit was being broadcast live 
the soviet president and his wife raisa emerged from their 
aeroflot ilyushin62 jet at colognebonn airport this morning and 
stood somberly for a 21gun salute before descending to the tarmac 
for a hearty greeting from foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
the kremlin motorcade of four zils made a detour to the soviet 
embassy before proceeding under a helicopter security escort to the 
villa hammerschmidt for a sunsplashed welcome by weizsaecker and 
kohl 
during his current fourday visit to west germany gorbachev 
leaves behind rioting in the central asian republic of uzbekistan 
and two weeks of sharp debate in the new congress over political 
power and economic failures 
his talks with west german officials will give him a chance to 
concentrate on foreign policy his area of greatest success in four 
years in power and the technology and financial help needed to 
modernize the soviet economy 
gorbachevs agenda includes meetings with scientific and business 
leaders and factory tours 
gorbachev says germany is at the center of what he calls our 
common european home public opinion polls in west germany have 
found him to be the most popular foreign leader ever 
soviet officials speaking at a briefing sunday in bonn said 
that the western allies need not fear that gorbachev might try to 
woo west germany to unite with communist east germany in a neutral 
entity 
georgy a arbatov head of the kremlins usacanada institute 
said the division of europe is unnatural but its up to germany to 
decide its political status 
were not exerting any behindthescenes pressure 
he said the soviet union instead of imposing solutions on its 
eastern euopean allies is committed to accept reforms in countries 
such as poland and hungary to solve problems that have been 
festering for years 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov was asked 
about european fears of germansoviet cooperation similar to the 
hitlerstalin nonaggression pact signed just before the nazis 
started world war ii 
he replied three things have changed since 1940 first the 
soviet union has changed second germany has changed third the 
world has changed how can you make comparisons 
west germany is natos frontline state facing the warsaw pact 
alliance and kohl has pressed the western allies to accept 
gorbachevs proposal for immediate talks to eliminate shortrange 
nuclear missiles most of the weapons are on german soil 
the united states and britain disagreed with kohl but a compomise 
was reached at last months nato summit in brussels the alliance 
agreed to a proposal by bush to couple negotiations on shortrange 
missiles with progress on reduction of conventional forces 
gorbachev offered in may to withdraw 500 soviet nuclear weapons 
but soviet officials said it was unlikely he would come to bonn with 
a response to the bush proposal 
for about five months the bush administration wouldnt answer 
our proposals arbatov said then they make a proposal and 
expect an answer right away

its time to put our best minds to work to turn technology and 
the power of the marketplace to the advantage of the environment to 
create to innovate to tip the scales in favor of recovery 
restoration and renewal 
every american expects and deserves to breathe clean air and as 
president it is my mission to guarantee it for this generation and 
for the generations to come 
if we take this commitment seriously if we believe that every 
american expects and deserves clean air and then we act on that 
belief then we will set an example for the rest of the world to 
follow 
today i am proposing to congress a new clean air act and 
offering a new opportunity 
weve seen enough of this stalemate 
its time to clear the air and you know i think we will 
we touched a lot of bases as we prepared this bill and weve had 
the benefit of some good thinking on the hill and weve met with 
business leaders who see environmental protection as essential to 
longterm economic growth and weve talked with environmentalists 
who know that costeffective solutions help build public support for 
conservation 
and weve worked with academics and innovative thinkers from 
every quarter who have laid the groundwork for this approach 
and just this morning i spoke by phone with prime minister 
mulroney of canada 
i believe hes excited about the prospect too 
i have no pride of authorship let me commend project 88 and 
groups like the environmental defense fund for bringing creative 
solutions to longstanding problems for not only breaking the mold 
but helping to build a new one 
and weve had to make some tough choices 
and some may think weve gone too far and others not far enough 
but we all care about clean air 
to the millions of americans who still breathe unhealthy air let 
me tell you im concerned im concerned about vulnerable groups 
like the elderly and asthmatics and children concerned about every 
americans quality of life 
and im committed to see that coming generations receive the 
natural legacy they deserve 
we seek reforms that make major pollution reductions where we 
most need them 
first our approach is reasonable deadlines for those who must 
comply 
it has compelling sanctions for those who dont 
it accounts for continued economic growth and expansion offers 
incentives choice and flexibility for industry to find the best 
solutions and taps the power of the marketplace and local 
initiative better than any previous piece of environmental 
legislation 
this legislation will be comprehensive 
it will be costeffective 
but above all it will work 
we will make the 1990s the era for clean air 
and we have three clear goals and three clear deadlines 
first we will cut the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid 
rain by almost half by 10 million tons 
and we will cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 2 million tons 
both by the year 2000 
we have set absolute goals for reductions and have emphasized 
early gains 
and that means 5 million tons will be cut by 1995 and the 
degradation caused by acid rain will stop by the end of this century 
to make sure that coal continues to play a vital role in our 
energy future weve provided an extension of three years and 
regulatory incentives for the use of innovative clean coal 
technology 
weve set an ambition an ambitious reduction target and 
applying market forces will be the fastest most costeffective way 
to achieve it 
so were allowing utilities to take to trade credits among 
themselves for reductions they make to let them decide how to bring 
aggregrate emissions down as cost effectively as possible

the supreme court today bolstered the power of 
judges to impose harsher penalties on criminal defendants who back 
out of pleabargained agreements that called for lighter sentences 
the justices by an 81 vote apparently reinstated the life 
sentence of an alabama man convicted of burglary 
before standing trial in 1986 james lewis smith had pleaded 
guilty to the burglary charge and had been sentenced to 30 years in 
prison for it 
smith was indicted in montgomery ala on charges of rape 
burglary and sodomy all arising from the same incident 
in a pleabargain agreement he pleaded guilty to rape and 
burglary and the sodomy charge was dropped smith was sentenced to 
30 years on each conviction with the sentences to run concurrently 
he then sought to withdraw his guilty plea and a state appeals 
court allowed him to do so it ruled that smith had not been 
informed that he would be sentenced as a repeat offender and would 
be subject to stiffer penalties than he expected 
smith then stood trial and was convicted of all three crimes the 
same state judge who had accepted his guilty plea sentenced smith to 
separate life terms for sodomy and burglary but set aside the 
sentence for smiths rape conviction 
the alabama supreme court last year threw out smiths life 
sentence on the burglary conviction ruling that it represented 
judicial vindictiveness 
the state courts ruling however did not affect smiths life 
sentence for the sodomy conviction 
alabama attorney general don siegelman then asked the nations 
highest court to draw a distinction between cases in which 
defendants withdraw guilty pleas and those in which they are 
resentenced after successfully appealing convictions or sentences 
in a pair of 1969 decisions the court limited judges power to 
impose more stringent sentences for defendants in both circumstances 
but todays decision reversed one of the 1969 rulings to create 
the distinction siegelman had sought 
there is no basis for a presumption of vindictiveness where a 
second sentence imposed after a trial is heavier than a first 
sentence imposed after a guilty plea chief justice william h 
rehnquist wrote for the court 
he said smith is free to pursue with the alabama supreme court 
his contention that there is evidence to support a finding of actual 
vindictiveness by the sentencing judge in his case 
justice thurgood marshall was the sole dissenter 
the case is alabama vs smith 88333

japans total foreign aid rose 225 percent to 913 
billion in 1988 making it the worlds secondlargest donor after 
the united states the foreign ministry said monday 
us foreign aid totaled about 98 billion last year the 
ministry said 
much of the growth in japans development assistance in dollar 
terms came from the japanese yens greater strength in foreign 
exchange markets in yen terms the 913 billion spent on foreign 
aid was an 86 percent increase over the 745 billion spent in 1987 
the ministry calculated dollar figures using the governments 
official average exchange rate for 1988 of 12815 yen to the dollar 
down from 14464 yen in 1987 
japans direct aid not channeled through international agencies 
accounted for 703 percent of the total or 642 billion the 
ministry said 
of total direct aid about 351 billion or 55 percent was in 
loans an increase of about 309 percent from 1987 the remaining 45 
percent 291 billion was in grants up 161 percent 
japans 10 billion foreign aid budget for fiscal 1989 would make 
it the worlds largest donor nation assuming the yen doesnt weaken 
significantly

the supreme court in a case involving ski 
equipment rentals ruled today that state taxes may be imposed when 
bankrupt companies sell their assets 
by a 63 vote the justices said the taxes may be imposed on such 
sales and on a buyers subsequent use of the assets when bankrupt 
companies are ordered to liquidate 
the court allowed california officials to tax the rental of skis 
by a ski resort that acquired the equipment from a bankrupt company 
nothing in the constitution or federal law forbids such state 
taxes said justice john paul stevens for the court 
he said a doctrine that bars states from imposing taxes on the 
federal government does not extend to private companies in 
bankruptcy proceedings such proceedings are overseen by federal 
judges who appoint officials to dispose of the assets 
states may tax private parties with whom the federal government 
does business even if a financial burden falls on the government 
stevens said 
whatever immunity the bankrupt estate once enjoyed from 
taxation on its operations has long since eroded and there is now no 
constitutional impediment to the imposition of a sales tax or use 
tax on a liquidation sale he said 
dissenting were justices harry a blackmun william j brennan 
and thurgood marshall 
the ruling is a defeat for sierra summit and the ski resorts 
parent corporation snow summit ski corp 
the corporation acquired the assets of china peak resort for 35 
million after china peak declared bankruptcy in 1981 the assets 
included skis to be used for renting to customers 
the california state board of equalization sought to assess 
55000 in taxes on the sale of the assets but a federal bankruptcy 
judge in 1983 barred the tax on grounds the assets transferred from 
a bankrupt company are exempt 
the state board took another approach in 1985 seeing to impose a 
use tax on income of 196518 that sierra summit received from 
renting the skis acquired from china peak 
under california law if sierra summit had paid either sales or 
use tax on its purchase of the skis the rental income would not be 
taxable 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals barred the taxes 
the case is california vs sierra summit 88681

cleaner fuels better technologies energy conservation improved 
efficiency in any combination just as long as it works 
theres a wisdom to handing work to those most qualified to do it 
four hundred years ago montaigne wrote let us permit nature 
to have her way she understands her business better than we do 
well its true 
acid rain must be stopped and thats what we all care about 
but its also true that business understands its business better 
than we do 
so were going to put that understanding to work on behalf of 
clean air and a sound environment 
weve provided the goals but we wont try to micromanage them 
we will allow flexibility in how industry achieves these goals 
but we stand firm on what must be achieved 
second this federal proposal will cut the emissions that cause 
urban ozone smog virtually in half 
this will put the states well on the road to meeting the standard 
twenty years ago 20 years ago we started on the job and if 
congress will act on the clean air reforms that im offering today 
20 years from now every american in every city in america will 
breathe clean air 
today 81 cities dont meet federal air quality standards 
this legislation will bring clean air to all but about 20 cities 
by 1995 and within 20 years even los angeles and houston and new 
york will be expected to make it 
in the nine urban areas with the greatest smog problem we 
propose bold new initiatives to reconcile the automobile to the 
environment ensuring continued economic growth without disruptive 
driving controls 
well accomplish this through alternative fuels and cleanfueled 
vehicles 
we propose to put up to a million cleanfueled vehicles a year on 
the road by 1997 
but were also proposing flexibility on the means even as we 
remain firm on the goals 
a city can either request inclusion in a program or if they show 
they can achieve these ambitious reductions through other measures 
we will scale back the cleanfuel vehicle requirements accordingly 
also were sensitive to the problems of smaller cities whose 
ozone problems are due largely to pollutants that are generated in 
other other areas other regions other cities 
they will not be penalized for pollution problems outside their 
control 
our program incorporates a mix of costeffective measures to cut 
emissions from cars fuels factories and other sources 
but i am asking the epa to develop rules like those we are 
employing on acid rain to allow auto and fuel companies to trade 
required reductions in order to meet this standard in the most 
costeffective way 
our challenge is to develop an emissions trading plan 
their challenge is to meet the standards 
the third leg of our proposal is designed to cut all categories 
of airborne toxic chemicals by threequarters within this decade 
our best minds will apply the most advanced industrial technology 
available to control these airborne poisons 
the very best control technology we have will determine the 
standard we set for those plans 
and until now because of an unworkable law the epa has been 
able to regulate only seven of the 280 known air toxics 
the bill im proposing today will set a schedule for regulating 
sources of air toxics by dates certain 
in addition it will give the dedicated people of the epa the 
right tools for the job and it will make stateoftheart 
technology an every day fact of doing business and thats the way it 
should be 
in its first phase this initiative should eliminate about 
threequarters of the needless deaths from cancer that have been 
caused by toxic industrial air emissions and we plan a second phase 
to go after any remaining unreasonable risk 
people who live near industrial facilities should not have to 
fear for their health 
and for 10 years we have struggled to engage a united effort on 
behalf of clean air and we are now on the edge of real change 
1989 could be recorded as the year when business leaders and 
environmental advocates began to work together when environmental 
issues moved out of the courts beyond conflict into a new era of 
cooperation 
and this can be known as the year we mobilized leadership both 
public and private to make environmental protection a growth 
industry and keep our ecology safe for diversity 
the wounded winds of north south east and west can be purified 
and cleansed and the integrity of nature can be made whole again 
ours is a rare opportunity to reverse the errors of this 
generation in the service of the next 
and we cannot we must not fail 
we must prevail 
i ask for your support 
we need your support to make all of this into a reality 
thank you all and god bless you and thank you very much for 
coming 
thank you all

astrophysicist fang lizhi again is at the center 
of a dispute between the united states and china hiding inside the 
us embassy as infuriated communist officials demand his arrest 
as chinas most prominent dissident fang has been an unwitting 
irritant in bilateral relations 
in february police prevented him from attending a party given by 
president bush for chinese officials 
the chinese government said it resented the us invitation to 
fang who has openly criticized marxism as a failure and says the 
economic reforms of senior leader deng xiaoping wont succeed 
without guarantees of basic rights such as freedom of speech 
fang is receiving protection in the us embassy as chinas 
conservative leaders seek to suppress all dissent from advocates of 
democratic reform 
chinese authorities issued an arrest warrant saturday for fang 
charging him with committing crimes of counterrevolutionary 
propaganda and instigation 
the man who is the target of the official ire is a beijing

conversation is punctuated by hearty laughs and an occasional knee 
slap of delight 
fang 53 says he is happiest pondering the mysteries of the 
universe and has a poster of albert einstein hanging on the wall of 
his flat near beijing university

the oneparty communist state into a freer society he was one of 
only a few chinese who dared to campaign publicly for democratic 
change before the popular uprising for freedom rocked beijing this 
spring

reporters but also tried to reach a broader tougher audience of 
chinese

human rights are basic fang told actors scientists and 
businessmen at a holiday tea party in february for human rights 
to be realized first of all famous people must take a stand he 
lectured 
fang burst into prominence during the prodemocracy student 
demonstrations of 198687 authorities alleged his speeches to

federal magistrates are not legally authorized 
to preside over jury selection even when delegated such duty by 
federal trial judges the supreme court ruled unanimously today 
the justices threw out the federal convictions in new york city 
of two men accused of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute 
it 
in an opinion by justice john paul stevens the court said the 
convictions of jose gomez and diego chaveztesina were tainted 
because the judge who presided over their trial assigned the task of 
presiding over jury selection to a federal magistrate 
stevens said a 1968 law allowing federal judges to delegate some 
duties to magistrates never was intended to include presiding over 
jury selection in trials involving serious crimes or felonies 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals had upheld the two 
convictions for which gomez had been sentenced to 10 years in 
prison and 10 years special parole and chaveztesina to 20 years in 
prison and lifetime special parole 
according to court documents gomez has been an inmate at a 
federal prison in ashland ky and chaveztesina is imprisoned in 
milan mich 
todays decision means both men are entitled to new trials 
the justices rejected bush administration arguments that even if 
a magistrate should not have presided over the juryselection part 
of the two mens trial that fact amounted to harmless error 
among those basic fairtrial rights that can never be treated 
as harmless is a defendants right to an impartial adjudicator be 
it judge or jury stevens wrote equally basic is a defendants 
right to have all critical stages of a criminal trial conducted by a 
person with jurisdiction to preside 
the cases are gomez vs us 885014 and chaveztesina vs 
us 885158

outspoken feminist 
ive read that some younger women dont see the need to 
identify themselves as a feminist the actress said in the july 
issue of glamour personally i feel i owe something to the women 
who came before me who sacrificed to get us where we are today 
ms shepherd said she became a feminist in 1970 but wasnt active 
until four years ago when she joined gloria steinems group voters 
for choice her first demonstration was an abortionrights rally in 
washington in april 
my belief that abortion is a constitutional right has gotten 
even stronger particularly because i have daughters said ms 
shepherd 
she has two daughters 9yearold clementine ford and 1yearold 
ariel shepherdoppenheim as well as ariels twin brother zack 
whenever you go out and march about an issue like this you 
take a risk youre exposed some fanatic might shoot you she

this issue to prevent the deaths that would result if abortion were

president bush today unveiled a sweeping 
legislative proposal to cut acid rain pollutants and curb smog 
plaguing the nations cities declaring too many americans 
continue to breathe dirty air 
the presidents proposal aimed at breaking a decadelong 
congressinal stalemate that has blocked enactment of tougher federal 
clean air laws calls for a 50 percent 10millionton reduction in 
sulfur dioxide emissions a chief cause of acid rain from 
coalburning power plants 
other measures include a phasein of cars powered by methanol 
aimed at curbing ozonecausing emissions from motor vehicles and a 
requirement for industry to use new technology to curb the release 
of cancercausing and other toxic chemicals 
in a white house speech bush said that while some progress has 
been made in cutting air pollution over the last decade we have 
not come far enough 
too many americans continue to breathe dirty air and 
political paralysis has plagued further progress against air 
pollution every american expects and deserves to breathe clean 
air he said 
bush said the new requirements call for tough choices to be 
made by congress and industry 
but he said action was required because of the millions of 
american who still breathe unhealthy air and the danger this poses 
to vulnerable groups such as the elderly asthmatics and children 
the president received a standing ovation after his speech from 
the more than 300 people crowded into the east room the invited 
audience included governors leaders of congress environmentalists 
and industry representatives 
brooks b yeager vice president for government relations of the 
national audubon society said we may quarrel with some of the 
details but its certainly a major step forward 
yeager and other environmentalists praised bushs blueprint for 
stopping acid rain but said he was not going far enough to control 
toxic poisons and other pollutants that are severe public health 
threats 
david gardiner legislative director for the sierra club said 
the president has laid out a bunch of very good objectives it 
will help break the logjam in congress 
earlier at a news briefing william k reilly administrator of 
the environmental protection agency called the clean air plan 
very ambitious and expensive but vitally needed 
reilly estimated the programs cost at between 14 billion and 
19 billion a year once it is in full effect at the turn of the 
century 
among the actions the president called on congress to require 
automakers to phase in cars that use alternate fuels such as 
methanol with a goal of having 500000 such vehicles in operation 
within six years and 1 million such cars produced annually after 
1996 
unlike gasolone methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes the 
severe smog problems that have made the air unhealthy in nearly 100 
metropolitan areas 
reilly said bushs proposals would bring most american cities 
within federal air quality standards by 1995 and all but the most 
severe problem areas los angeles houston and new york city 
within the guidelines by the year 2000 
the proposed legislation also calls for tightening tailpipe 
emissions from automobiles by 40 percent and curbing other 
automobile fuelrelated pollutants 
in an attempt to curb the release of toxic chemicals from 
industrial plants bush proposed requiring industry to use the 
best available technology to curb such pollution the plan 
anticipates near term reductions in airborne toxic chemicals 
including many that are cancer causing of between 75 and 90 percent 
the proposals are part of a clean air package the president plans 
to send to congress in the coming weeks environmental legislation 
some of it calling for stronger actions than proposed by the 
president already has been introduced on capitol hill 
congressional leaders said they expect a revision of the 1970 
clean air act which was last changed in 1977 to be enacted in this 
congress probably early next year 
the proposal to combat acid rain calls for half of the 
10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide to be achieved by 1995 
the proposal would allow utilities that exceed the required 
reductions to accumulate credits that would be sold or traded to 
other utilities that are unable to reach the reduction targets 
about 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide gas are released annually 
into the air most from power plants that burn highsulphur coal 
the gas turns into sulfates combines with moisture and falls as 
rain or snow often hundreds of miles away 
scientists have blamed acid rain for causing substantial damage 
to lakes forests and acquatic life especially in the northeast and 
canada as a result of pollutants released from power plants in the 
ohio valley and industrial midwest 
bushs clean air package has been widely viewed as the first test 
of whether his administration plans to act decisively on 
environmental issues 
governors active in the bipartisan alliance for acid rain control 
said in a television interview before the announcement that they 
were encouraged by bushs plan 
there is no question its going to be enforced wisconsin 
gov tommy thompson said on cbs this morning its a giant 
step forward for cleaning up the air and the atmosphere and our 
lakes especially in states like wisconsin and minnesota 
the president promised in his campaign last year and repeatedly 
since taking office that he will move to tighten the federal clean 
air laws especially by taking action to curb acid rain 
last week bush told a conservation group the clean air package he 
intends to send congress would represent sweeping changes in the 
1970 clean air act and significantly improve every north 
americans quality of life whether they live near industrial 
plants or in the countryside 
the final package was approved by bush over the weekend at camp 
david where the president reviewed an array of option papers 
prepared by his domestic policy council which had debated 
provisions of the package for weeks 
urban smog largely caused by automobile pollutants has been one 
of the most difficult issues facing the administration advisers 
were split over whether to require specific curbs to reduce 
ozonecausing pollutants or allow automakers and the petroleum 
industry to decide how best to meet government targets 
legislation already has been introduced in the house to require 
stringent reductions in ozonecausing pollutants cuts in acid rain 
pollutants from coalburning power plants and curbs in the release 
of toxic chemicals from industrial plants 
some of the legislation already before congress is tougher than 
that envisioned by bushs advisers 
environmentalists for example have sought a reduction in sulfur 
dioxide from power plants of at least 12 million tons over the next 
decade and have argued for tougher automobile emission controls

a revival of revolutionary fervor and the assassination of british 
author salman rushdie for allegedly blaspheming islam in his novel 
the satanic verses 
rafsanjani thanked the assembly of experts a body of 
parliamentarians and theologians for their swift selection of a new 
leader the day after khomeinis death the people welcomed this 
right choice and the enemies mourntheir empty dreams shattered he 
said referring to predictions that iran would be plunged into

while serving the people carry out the principles of islam

a judge today found an obstetrician guilty of 
infanticide on grounds that a fetus taken during an abortion on a 
13yearold was alive instead of stillborn as the doctor claimed 
dr joseph melnick 66 originally was accused of murder but that 
charge was dismissed and replaced with the infanticide charge 
allowed under the states abortion law 
the doctor could be sentenced to a prison term of 3 to 7 years 
melnicks attorney richard sprague said immediately after the 
verdict that he would appeal the case all the way until we get a 
vindication he suggested his client was the victim of the 
frustration raised over the abortion issue and not the evidence 
i submit the evidence showed dr melnick was innocent he 
said 
assistant district attorney andrea foulkes who prosecuted the 
case said it was the first criminal prosecution under the 
pennsylvania abortion control act which requires that a physician 
performing an abortion must attempt to keep the fetus alive if 
possible she also said she knows of no other similar case based on 
a charge of infanticide anywhere in the nation 
common pleas judge lynne abraham heard closing arguments last 
week and announced her verdict this morning after spending the 
weekend reviewing some 6000 pages of testimony compiled in the 
13week trial 
i find you guilty as charged of the crime of infanticide 
said the judge without any additional explanation of her verdict 
she set a sept 19 court date on the motion she expects from 
sprague for a new trial the first step in the appeal process 
ms abrahams only comments on the case itself came last friday 
after sprague said in his closing arguments that the evidence was 
conclusive that melnick considered the baby stillborn after the 
abortion on sept 12 1984 
this case is one of unusual duration and complexity the 
judge said then 
melnick claimed he was told his patient was in her fourth month 
of pregnancy when she was actually in the eighth month he testified 
the baby was stillborn 
other members of the west park hospital medical staff where the 
abortion was performed said they detected a heartbeat and claimed 
they saw the baby move and gasp but other witnesses however 
agreed with melnicks diagnosis that the infant was stillborn 
if dr melnick thought this child were alive what motivation 
would he have not to do something sprague said 
disagreeing foulkes said in her closing argument that melnick 
was faced with a viable child not a dead fetus and stalled and 
stalled and stalled and didnt act until the baby stopped moving 
today the prosecutor reacted to the verdict by saying i am 
very very gratified

the task of a un conference beginning tuesday is 
to find ways of handling a dramatic increase in the number of 
refugees who flee vietnam in small boats and land in other southeast 
asian countries 
the twoday meeting of 50 nations is aimed at relieving the 
growing frustration of both countries of first asylum and 
resettlement countries said the office of the un high 
commissioner for refugees 
fourteen years after the vietnam war ended more than 12 million 
vietnamese have been resettled the majority in the united states 
most of the resettlement occurred after a 1979 geneva conference on 
their plight 
since 1986 resettlement has lagged behind the rate at which 
refugees continue to flee vietnam undeterred by the dangers which 
include attacks by pirates who rape and murder 
many western resettlement countries also confronted with growing 
numbers of wouldbe immigrants from other regions have reduced the 
number of people they will accept 
last year foreign ministers of the association of south east 
asian nations brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines 
singapore and thailand called for a comprehensive solution to the 
problem of refugees from indochina 
the flow continued to increase and hong kong has borne the brunt 
in 1988 it stopped granting automatic refugee status to all boat 
people 
most refugees now come from northern vietnam often through 
china where many buy small boats for the final part of the journey 
in may alone hong kongs population of refugees and 
asylumseekers increased by one third nearly 9000 more than the 
total arrivals in all other coastal states of the region 
those accepted as refugees get work permits in the british 
colony where the legal minimum monthly salary is equal to about 2 
years pay for a worker in vietnam 
under the policy adopted in june 1988 hong kong treats boat 
people as illegal immigrants and economic refugees unless they 
can prove they fled political persecution about nine of 10 are 
being refused refugee status 
after the number of refugees landing in the philippines tripled 
authorities announced screening procedures in march and said all 
people who could not prove political persecution would be sent back 
singapore refuses to let people ashore if they arrive in their 
own boats news reports say boats have been forced back to sea at 
gunpoint along the thai coast 
screening is only one element in a sixpage draft plan to be 
considered at the geneva conference which also includes an expanded 
resettlement program it relies on an international media 
campaign to publicize the dangers and disadvantages of escaping by 
boat and the benefits of regular emigration programs 
the plan urges that vietnamese refused refugee status be 
encouraged to return home and stipulates if after the passage 
of reasonable time it becomes clear that voluntary repatriation is 
not making sufficient progress alternatives recognized as being 
acceptable under international practices would be examined 
only 143 vietnamese have volunteered to go home since march 
despite assurances from hanoi that they can return safely many 
people involved with the refugee program doubt a substantial 
increase in the rate is possible 
the hong kong chapter of the oxfam relief agency supports 
forcible return combined with western encouragement of more open 
policies by vietnam and help in developing the countrys economy 
at the conference the united states is expected to lead 
opposition to forcible repatriation vietnamese refugees living in 
several western countries arrived in geneva to urge delegates to 
treat the boat people with humanity 
sending them back to hell from which they managed to escape 
would be totally inhuman said a petition a frenchbased 
committee claimed was signed by 20000 vietnamese emigres in the 
past two weeks

an attorney for white firemen challenging 
a racially tailored hiring plan in the birmingham fire department 
said todays us supreme court ruling clears the way for white 
firefighters to have their day in court 
but an attorney for black firemen said the judicial system would 
have to ignore history to rule against affirmative action in 
alabamas largest city 
ray fitzpatrick an attorney for the international association of 
firefighters local 17 representing white firemen said the ruling 
in the reverse discrimination case is a step toward ending 
racebased quota promotions that harm white firefighters in 
birmingham 
city fire chief neal gallant declined comment neither birmingham 
city attorney jim baker nor mayor richard arrington could not be 
reached immediately by telephone for comment 
the courts decision on a 54 vote held that an affirmative 
action plan agreed to by city officials and approved in court may be 
attacked later by workers who took no part in the case leading to 
the original agreement 
new york attorney robert joffe who represents black firefighters 
in the case said the decision is just another unfortunately in 
a too long line of recent cases in which the supreme court has put 
up road blocks in the way of affirmative action plaintiffs 
he said the birmingham case would be a good test of an 
affirmative action policy 
you would have to ignore several hundred years of united states 
history to find there wasnt sufficient record to warrant 
affirmative action in birmingham he said 
but fitzpatrick said the supreme court decision means the city 
may no longer bind its unconsenting nonminority employees to an 
agreement which those employees had no part in making 
birmingham has engaged in racebased quota promotions and 
claims it is protected by a consent decree to which the nonminority 
employees were not a party he said we have simply tried to 
obtain a day in court to contest the legality of the racial quotas 
that birmingham has been following 
fitzpatrick added that the city has never been willing to 
engage in any meaningful discussions with the white employees 
the birmingham case began in 1974 when city officials and the 
jefferson county personnel board were sued by the national 
association for the advancement of colored people and blacks 
charging racial bias in the city fire department eventually both 
sides reached agreement on a plan for the hiring and promotion of 
minorities 
the birmingham firefighters association opposed the plan but its 
objections were rejected by a federal judge who issued consent 
decrees in 1981 approving the agreement seven white firefighters 
then challenged the promotion plan saying lessqualified blacks 
were being promoted ahead of them 
initially a federal judge ruled that the white firefighters must 
abide by the consent decree but a federal appeals court in 1987 
reinstated the suit and the supreme court today agreed and cleared 
the way for the white firefighters case to be heard

the supreme court today limited the deadlines 
for filing some lawsuits that accuse employers of illegal sex bias 
in a 53 ruling the court threw out a suit by three women who 
said a change in the seniority system at an atampt plant in illinois 
discriminated against them 
the court said the women waited too long to sue 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said the women had 
300 days to sue from the time the seniority system change was 
adopted not 300 days from the time they were affected personally 
by the new seniority rules 
scalia said the shorter time period for suing applies to cases in 
which an employer is accused of unintentional bias adopting rules 
that on their face do not discriminate on the basis of sex 
allowing a facially neutral system to be challenged many 
years after its adoption would disrupt the legitimate interests of 
other workers who benefitted by the new rules scalia said 
in a dissenting opinion justice thurgood marshall said the 
ruling shields acts of intentional discrimination 
he said employees who are victims of bias must sue within 300 
days of a change in the employers system even if the employee 
could not reasonably have expected to be demoted or otherwise 
concretely harmed by the new system at the time of its adoption and 
indeed even if the employee was not working in the affected 
division of the company at the time of the systems adoption 
such a severe interpretation of deadlines for suing violates 
title vii of the 1964 civil rights act outlawing discrimination 
based on race or sex he said 
justices willima j brennan and harry a blackmun joined 
marshalls dissent 
justice sandra day oconnor did not take part in the ruling 
the case involves patricia a lorance janice m king and carol 
s bueschen employees in atampts montgomery works in aurora ill 
they were demoted in 1982 because of a restructured seniority 
system 
under the change seniority for the skilled job of tester no 
longer was determined on the basis of how long a worker was at the 
plant but rather how long the employee worked as a tester 
the change was incorporated into a contract between atampt 
technologies and local 1942 of the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers 
the three women said the change was designed to limit the job 
rights of female workers who had been promoted recently into 
traditionally male jobs 
they filed charges with the equal employment opportunity 
commission in april 1983 within the 300day time limit prescribed 
by law if that period started with the date the revamped seniority 
rules caused their demotions 
but a federal magistrate in 1986 ruled the three waited too long 
because they had not filed their complaint within 300 days of when 
the new system was adopted in 1979 
the magistrates ruling was upheld by a federal trial judge the 
7th us cirucit court of appeals and today by the supreme court 
the case is lorance vs atampt 871428

a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction 
today that bars the state from enforcing its yearold obscenity law 
saying it is unconstitutionally vague and unfairly exempts libraries 
and schools 
under the ruling by us district judge jp stadtmueller the 
state may appeal to the federal appeals court or ask for a trial if 
the state does neither the preliminary injunction would become 
permanent and the law would have to be scrapped 
two milwaukee stores denmark book store and paradise video 
store in addition to pure pleasure ii bookstore in oshkosh filed 
suit in federal court against the state calling the obscenity 
statute unconstitutional 
since the law was passed last spring no one has been criminally 
prosecuted the law which was intended to halt commercial traffic 
in hardcore pornography calls for jail terms of up to five years 
and fines of up to 10000 for pornography wholesalers 
under the statute material is obscene if it lacks serious 
literary artistic political educational or scientific value 
attorney general donald j hanaway said today that he had not 
seen the decision and would not comment yet 
stephen m glynn the attorney representing the stores called 
the decision wellreasoned and said were very pleased by it 
but a sponsor of the legislation sen joseph andrea said he was 
disappointed by stadtmuellers decision 
sponsors he said were very careful when we put this the law 
together to address the constitutional concerns andrea said 
in his decision stadtmueller said the statute was 
unconstitutionally vague the judge said it was difficult to 
determine whether the law was violated by depicting sexually 
explicit conduct by describing sexually explicit conduct or both 
in addition stadtmueller said the state violated the equal 
protection clause of the constitution by exempting libraries 
schools and universities from prosecution under the statute 
the law allows a school library to commercially distribute 
obscene materials without the threat of prosecution but does not 
allow an adult bookstore to do the same the judge said 
the judge also found unconstitutional the laws distinction 
between contract printers and bookstore clerks under the statute 
the printers would not be threatened with prosecution but the store 
clerks would 
stadtmueller did rule in favor of the state however when he 
said that the legislature intended to include videotapes as well as 
film under the statute

sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate 
finance committee served notice on colleagues monday that he will 
oppose addition of special tax breaks for selected individuals or 
businesses to any legislation written by the panel this year 
as chairman i have opposed and will continue to oppose any tax 
amendments that unfairly benefit certain taxpayers while not 
benefiting other similarly situated taxpayers bentsen dtexas 
said in a letter 
moreover i have been forthcoming with information available to 
me about the beneficiaries of tax legislation and i plan to 
continue that practice he added 
it has been almost routine practice for several years for members 
of the finance and house ways and means committees to attach 
amendments benefiting one or two individuals or businesses to 
general tax bills the beneficiaries were seldom named in the 
legislation 
the practice was all but abandoned in 1988 apparently because of 
the public outcry that followed inclusion of large numbers of 
special breaks in the massive 1986 tax overhaul 
bentsens committee is likely to write several tax bills this 
year on tuesday the panel will consider expanding tax credits for 
childcare expenses and rewriting a 1986 provision requiring 
employers to conduct complex tests to prove that their 
healthinsurance plans do not discriminate against lowerpaid 
workers

a federal judge today dismissed one of the 10 
perjury counts against former rep pat swindall as the defense phase 
of his trial got under way 
us district judge richard c freeman said there was confusion 
over what period of time was being discussed when swindall testified 
to a federal grand jury about his knowledge of a mortgage company 
he rejected defense motions to throw out the other nine counts as 
well 
swindall a republican was defeated in his bid for a third term 
in the us house last november not long after he was indicted he 
represented a district in suburban atlanta 
he is charged with lying to a federal grand jury in february 1988 
regarding his 1987 negotiations with an undercover agent posing as a 
money launderer and with swindall associate charles lechasney later 
convicted of money laundering many of the negotiations were taped 
and played for the jury during the prosecution phase of the trial 
the original charges cited 37 statements to the grand jury that 
prosecutors said were false grouping the statements into 10 perjury 
charges on friday freeman ruled that five of the 37 statements 
were irrelevant to the case but he let all 10 counts stand until 
this morning 
the count dismissed today involved swindalls knowledge of who 
was to own the gulf coast mortgage co that was created during 
swindalls negotiations for a 850000 housing loan 
the prosecution rested its case last week the trial began last 
month 
also today freeman cut short the testimony of rep barney frank 
dmass and said he would instruct the jury to disregard franks 
comments in the hour he spent on the witness stand 
the judge said the testimony of frank called by the defense to 
describe the workings of congress might infringe on the 
constitutional protection given to members of congress for 
performance of their duties 
frank had testified that swindall was not a member of the 
subcommittee that handled the moneylaundering act of 1986 and that 
most congressmen do not have time to learn specifics of all 
legislation before congress 
at least two other congressmen rep howard coble rnc and 
rep j alex mcmillan rnc also had been subpoenaed to testify 
for the defense but they had filed a motion seeking to have their 
subpoenaes thrown out 
swindall himself is expected to take the stand possibly as early 
as this week if convicted he could faces up to five years in 
prison on each count of perjury

a single factor even the illegal practice 
of plural marriage should not have been the deciding factor in a 
judges refusal to allow a polygamist couple to adopt six motherless 
children an attorney told the utah supreme court today 
instead vaughn and sharane fischers other qualifications as 
adoptive parents should have been considered in a full hearing by 
the lowercourt judge who denied the couples petition to adopt the 
children whose mother had married fischer said attorney david 
nuffer 
the court heard oral arguments today from nuffer representing 
the fischers and attorney timothy anderson on behalf of the 
childrens grandfather and two aunts the relatives opposed the 
adoption following the death from cancer of the mother brenda 
thornton in 1987 she had married fischer who had two other wives 
and more than a dozen children three months before her death and 
assigned custody to the fischer family 
the question of what is best for the children is central to the 
issue of whether the children should be permitted to remain in the 
fischer home in the polygamist southern utah town of hildale said 
nuffer 
but anderson told the five justices that like slavery polygamy 
was an anathema to society that was ended with good reason in 
the 19th century 
the mormon church dropped polygamy as a tenet of its faith in 
1890 in exchange for statehood however an estimated 20000 to 
30000 still practice plural marriage although they are 
excommunicated from the church if they do so 
practicing polygamy is a seconddegree felony in utah although 
the law has not been actively enforced in more than three decades 
the case does not hinge on the fischers right to hold to their 
fundamentalist mormon beliefs but on the states responsibility to 
protect children from being taught practices that are clearly 
illegal anderson said 
the court will rule later on the matter the fischers want the 
justices to remand the case back to 5th circuit court for a full 
hearing on the issues 
before her death ms thornton and fischer signed a legal 
document relinquishing custody of her children to the fischer 
family in it ms thornton said she felt vaughn and sharane fischer 
would be good parents the childrens biological father phil 
thornton consented to the release of the children to the fischers 
but late last year a judge dismissed an adoption petition filed 
by the fischers though he stayed the decision giving them a chance 
to appeal in dismissing the petition judge dean e conder said the 
case centered on one issue whether the fischers polygamist 
lifestyle should disqualify them from adopting the children then 
ranging in age from 5 to 19 
while the case was on appeal the children continued to live with 
the fischers in their 14bedroom house 
ms thorntons stepsister pat johanson said the original 
custody transfer was signed under pressure from the fundamentalists 
and ms thornton really wanted her to take the children 
five weeks before ms thornton died ms johanson moved from her 
washington dc home to hildale to be at her stepsisters bedside 
she says that the dying woman confided that she wanted the children 
out of fundamentalism but at the same time didnt want to do 
anything openly fearing excommunication 
ms johanson also said that the three youngest thornton children 
julia janelle and deanne came forward one at a time to say they 
did not want to live with the fischers 
but steven snow attorney for the fischers has disputed the 
deathbed conversations and statements concerning the children 
a friend of the court brief filed by the american civil liberties 
union of utah foundation on behalf of the fischers argues that 
polygamy should be permitted in the state 
polygamy was sanctioned by the early mormon church but after it 
was banned by the state the church condemned and distanced itself 
from the practice however some fundamentalist offshoots of the 
church of jesus christ of latterday saints still believe in the 
practice

key discoveries in the effects of radiation the 
genetics of cancer and substances that regulate development of blood 
cells have earned cancer prizes for five researchers 
the three general motors cancer research foundation prizes each 
worth 130000 will be presented wednesday in washington 
mortimer elkind of colorado state university in fort collins will 
receive a prize for his studies of the biological effects of 
radiation 
his work made it possible for tens of thousands of cancer 
patients a year to receive radiation therapy safely and effectively 
the foundation said 
the research is being used to define permissible levels of 
radiation exposure from medical xrays nuclear plants radon and 
other sources the foundation said 
a second prize will be shared by peter nowell of the university 
of pennsylvania school of medicine in philadelphia and janet rowley 
of the university of chicago their work dealt with chromosomes 
threadlike bodies that carry genes 
nowell was a codiscoverer of the first consistent chromosome 
abnormality in cancer which led to research linking more than 100 
such defects to cancer the foundation said 
rowley revealed that the abnormality occurred when the ends of 
two particular chromosomes switched places 
the third prize will be shared by donald metcalf of the walter 
and eliza hall institute of medical research in victoria australia 
and leo sachs of the weizmann institute of science in rehovot 
israel

secretary of state james a baker iii has 
opened talks with chinas ambassador here in an effort to resolve 
the case of two dissidents being sheltered in the us embassy in 
beijing it was disclosed today 
baker called ambassador han xu to his office on saturday and the 
envoy was summoned back on sunday for another talk with robert 
kimmitt the undersecretary for political affairs state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said today 
the conversations dealt with fang lizhi an astrophysicist and 
his wife li shuxian an assistant professor at beijing university 
they were accused of counterrevolutionary activities and warrants 
for their arrest were issued sunday 
were trying to resolve it said a senior official who 
declined to be identified 
ms tutwiler meanwhile challenged chinese assertions that 
hundreds of protesting students were not slain by army troops on 
june 3 
the whole world has seen what happened in tiananmen square 
she said large numbers of peaceful demonstrators were killed by 
army units we condemn the use of live fire against unarmed 
civilians which is what happened in tiananmen square 
the spokeswoman said the demonstrators were seeking basic human 
rights labeling such people counterrevolutionaries and hooligans 
will do nothing to alter the reality of what happened in tiananmen 
square on june 3 she said 
earlier today the bush administration indicated it would not 
permit the chinese to arrest the two dissidents who took refuge in 
the embassy 
when a person presents himself to one of our embassies and says 
he is imminent danger and we have reason to give it credence 
sometimes we grant refuge a us official said and when we do 
that i ask you what does it mean 
the administration in dealing with the crackdown on dissidents 
and other prodemocracy forces is trying not to inflame the 
situation by denouncing chinese authorities 
but the statement by the us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity indicated that any attempt to arrest fang and li would be 
resisted 
the charges against the two dissidents could amount to 
accusations of treason and amid the turmoil in china carry the 
threat of a death sentence 
the beijing government warned that leaders of independent groups 
who refuse to surrender will be arrested and dealt with severely 
meanwhile uschinese relations have turned sour president 
bush has suspended military sales to beijing and all americans 
except diplomats were urged to leave the country 
james lilley the us ambassador to china said today the 
jurys still out on how the situation will unfold 
right now we have the semblance of order and control he said 
on abctvs good morning america certainly beijing is an 
orderly city right now but i think that we have to wait and see 
lilley declined to discuss the fang situation saying its too 
sensitive if you get up and start posturing it lessens the 
chance of getting something done 
in a separate interview with nbctvs today program lilley 
said he hoped the dispute over fang and li was not volatile at 
all 
we hope that its settled and its out of the way fairly 
soon he said 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said when asked 
about fang its our judgment its not helpful in any way to 
comment he added that the administration was considering this 
situation 
a reporter called out a question about fang to president bush at 
the start of a meeting with congressional leaders 
the lawmakers took that as their cue to break out into a hearty 
chorus of happy birthday mr president for bush who turned 65 
today bush laughed and reporters were quickly escorted out of the 
room

foreign reporters covering chinas crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters no longer have bullets whizzing past their 
heads but some said monday their job has become harder in the 
growing climate of fear 
television crews have had their film or equipment confiscated and 
been forced to write selfcriticisms other reporters have been 
stopped by police from talking to people on the street or have had 
notebooks taken a british reporter was expelled from shanghai 
the australian embassy expressed grave concern monday over the 
safety of its countrys journalists saying from what weve seen 
the last few days we cant seriously expect the police or troops to 
be fussy about who they shoot 
sources also are drying up chinese said they fear talking to 
reporters even in private as the number of reported arrests in 
connection with seven weeks of prodemocracy protests neared 1000 
you have to be so careful said jan wong of the toronto globe 
and mail i dont want to ask people on the street their names 
for their protection 
tv crews that already were taking precautions when shooting 
photographs to avoid detection by security officials said a new 
damper was put on their work by the government use of an abc 
videotape to track down a chinese man 
china central television apparently intercepted the unedited 
video as abc sent it by satellite to new york it showed a 
42yearold worker claiming that 20000 people were killed when the 
army fired on student protesters and supporters june 34 
cctv broadcast the interview and urged viewers to find the man 
two women reported him within hours and he was arrested 
abc said it was deeply distressed over the use of its tape 
and began covering the faces of students it interviewed 
mike chinoy beijing bureau chief of the cable news network said 
some cnn footage also has been used on chinese tv although no 
arrests have been reported as a result 
even the people i know with the most extensive contacts among 
the chinese are not talking to them because they dont want to get 
them in trouble chinoy said im depressed profoundly i 
think its going to change living and working in china 
no news organizations said they were pulling reporters out of 
china because of the difficulties but cnns vito maggiolo said some 
of the 25 staff now in beijing might leave by weeks end 
the story has gone behind the scenes and underground to a great 
extent he said theres much less to see 
chinoy said the irony is that after a period in which it had 
gotten easier and the government had become tolerant of a huge range 
of reporting all of a sudden its reverted to a decade ago 
weve been forced to cover china the way china watchers did when it 
was a closed society reading the official xinhua news agency 
talking to diplomats and each other 
under the martial law imposed in beijing may 20 reporters are 
barred from conducting interviews on the streets on campuses at 
factories and other sites without official permission photographing 
and making audio tapes also are forbidden most reporters have 
ignored the restrictions 
many news organizations have sent reporters to shanghai despite 
official warning they need permission to work there 
on saturday china expelled a reporter for britains independent 
television news who was photographing student protesters outside 
shanghai police headquarters he was questioned and put on a plane 
to hong kong 
more expulsions were expected china expelled two reporters after 
the last major student demonstrations in 198687 
several camera crews for the bbc have been detained by police for 
photographing on the street and in one case were forced at gunpoint 
to kneel on the ground in the most recent incident reporter brian 
barron said he and his crew had their passports confiscated sunday 
were told to write selfcriticisms and ordered not to leave china 
without permission 
another western tv network that asked not to be identified said a 
crew was detained and released only after writing selfcriticisms 
in most cases such selfcriticisms have consisted of accounts of 
what the reporters were doing with some apologies for 
inconveniencing officials 
adi ignatius of the wall street journal said he scuffled saturday 
with plainclothes security who tried to detain him at the beijing 
normal university campus he said he broke free of the men who did 
not identify themselves and got in his car they kicked the car 
door and broke the mirror as he drove away 
the only foreign news organization to be criticized publicly is 
the voice of america the official media has castigated it daily 
since friday for alleged distortions voa frequencies have been 
jammed for weeks 
weve been criticized in the past by the media and officials 
said voa beijing bureau chief alan pessin this is unprecedented 
in length and scope theyre engaged in an extensive effort to 
rewrite the history of the past 10 days their tirades against voa 
are only a part of that

the united states and soviet union signed an 
agreement monday intended to keep straying warplanes or other 
dangerous military activities from starting a war by accident 
it was signed at the defense ministry gen mikhail a moiseyev 
the soviet chief of staff and adm william j crowe jr chairman 
of the us joint chiefs crowe began an 11day official visit to 
the soviet union on monday 
in remarks prepared for the ceremony crowe called the agreement 
an unprecedented effort to develop procedures intended to diminish 
tensions and dangers associated with military activities 
he said the 19page accord worked out in nine months of 
negotiations illustrated how far relations have advanced toward a 
more sustainable larger relationship between our countries 
before joining crowe in a champagne toast moiseyev said the 
agreement which takes effect jan 1 will make it possible for the 
two nations to solve all the problems they share in a more 
constructive way 
the agreement is intentionally limited in scope and does not 
treat some areas covered by other agreements among those were the 
shooting death of a us army major in east germany in 1985 and the 
bumping of two us navy ships by soviet vessels in the black sea 
last year 
it covers the accidental straying of military units into the 
others territory hazardous use of laser range finders that could 
blind the other countrys soldiers or sailors hampering the other 
countrys military operations in a tense area like the persian gulf 
during the iraniraq war and interfering with command and 
communications networks 
maj gen george l butler of the air force deputy director of 
strategic planning on crowes staff told a news briefing the 
agreement gives radio frequencies and code phrases for contacting 
military aircraft ships or ground units that go a stray 
butler also said however that it did not cover some areas in 
which trouble has arisen in the past the general led the us 
negotiating team 
one example butler mentioned was the bumping of the us navy 
ships by soviet vessels feb 12 1988 off crimea he said that was 
addressed by a term in maritime law defining the right of innocent 
passage and negotiators were considering the incident separately 
maj arthur nicholson was shot and killed by soviet soldiers in 
east germany on march 24 1985 butler said such problems would not 
be affected by the document signed monday because they fell under a 
1947 agreement regulating activities of the wartime allies military 
personnel in germany 
ussoviet talks were held after nicholsons death to clarify 
the 1947 accord and prevent a recurrence butler said 
he said the dangerous military activities agreement also is 
not designed to prevent the destruction of civilian aircraft as 
when the soviets shot down a south korean airliner that entered 
their airspace in 1985 killing all 269 people aboard 
the chief soviet negotiator maj gen anatoly bolyatko said 
measures to protect civilian aircraft were being considered by the 
international civil aviation organization a un agency based in 
montreal 
crowes visit follows a tour of the united states in july by 
moiseyevs predecessor marshal sergei f akhromeyev now an adviser 
to president mikhail s gorbachev the vice chiefs of staff of the 
four us services accompanied crowe 
on tuesday he is to watch soviet aerial maneuvers at a base near 
moscow the admiral is scheduled to visit murmansk leningrad 
minsk volgograd tashkent samarkand and the black sea resort of 
sochi 
tass the official news agency said crowe also would visit the 
missile cruiser kirov and a training range of soviet marine 
infantry and inspect soviet military hardware

place in russian hearts

mrs gorbachev said as she visited the modest structure on the 
fringes of bonns historic old town

house now a museum in a ceremony formalizing an exchange program 
of young musicians from the soviet union and west germany

sidewalk carrying placards protesting alleged soviet atrocities in 
afghanistan

shouted raisa raisa and waved as she arrived by limousine 
after a brief ceremony that included a performance of several of 
beethovens works the two first ladies toured the tiny green house 
now surrounded by tall modern buildings and busy shops 
its amazing that such great men can be born in such small 
rooms mrs gorbachev said 
beethoven is in all of our hearts mrs gorbachev said 
referring to the soviet peoples appreciation of the german master 
during the tour mrs gorbachev displayed intense interest in the 
houses history and appearance at one point she stumbled in the 
courtyard but mrs kohl quickly grabbed her arm to keep her from 
falling 
mrs kohl told her beethoven was born in a part of the house 
behind an inner courtyard that was heavily damaged by bombs during 
world war ii she said restoration efforts were continuing there 
the museum in the front part of the building is open to the 
public and displays period furniture a piano used by beethoven and 
other artifacts

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
on monday welcomed us proposals to reduce conventional forces in 
europe and said they could result in a speedier agreement between 
the superpowers 
but gorbachev in his first state visit to west germany stressed 
during a dinner given by chancellor helmut kohl that the kremlin 
still wants simultaneous talks to be held on reducing shortrange 
nuclear weapons 
gorbachev enormously popular in west germany arrived in bonn 
amid much fanfare monday as he seeks to strengthen ties to west 
germany and bridge the ideological differences that divide the 
continent 
today we can already state that we have started to leaf 
through the first pages of a new chapter in our relations 
gorbachev said at the gathering in bonns resplendent redoute palace 
kohl meanwhile appealed to gorbachev for a unilateral soviet 
cut in shortrange nuclear missiles soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady i gerasimov conceded at a briefing earlier that 
the warsaw pact has an advantage in such weapons 
gorbachev said the alliance would wait until its next meeting 
expected in july before giving a detailed response to president 
bushs proposals for substantial cuts in eastbloc and western 
armies in europe by the early 1990s 
he said the soviets already had noted with satisfaction that 
the west had produced proposals and accepted some eastern 
suggestions 
there is now reason to presume that an agreement in vienna can 
be reached much more quickly than was expected earlier gorbachev 
said referring to the site of eastwest talks on conventional 
weapons 
but he stressed the soviet union still wants parallel talks on 
reducing shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
the issue has caused squabbling within the nato alliance 
recently west germany demanded talks soon on reducing shortrange 
nuclear weapons while the united states said a conventional arms 
reduction must be negotiated first because of soviet superiority in 
nonnuclear weapons 
the disagreement was resolved with a compromise during a nato 
summit last week when the western alliance agreed that a partial 
reduction of shortrange nuclear weapons could be negotiated 
about 120 dignitaries were invited to the dinner in the opulent 
palace gorbachev was accompanied by his wife raisa 
bonn government spokesman hans klein said kohl briefed gorbachev 
thoroughly on the nato summit and the bush proposals during 70 
minutes of talks 
the state visit which comes as soviet troops try to quell a 
bloody ethnic dispute in the republic of uzbekistan began amid 
strong assurances from both sides that the nations that helped to 
divide europe now want to overcome that rift 
the two countries already intend bolster their commercial 
cultural and political links tuesday by signing 11 agreements and a 
common statement of purpose that klein said is a very 
significant even historic document 
the declaration will satisfy the very profound desire our 
peoples have to heal the wounds of the past with understanding and 
reconciliation and to build a better future kohl said at the 
dinner 
klein said kohl urged the soviet leader to make quick 
progress at the vienna talks on reducing conventional arms 
we are not against quick progress in the vienna talks were 
for it gerasimov said at the briefing with klein we will be 
ready to negotiate in a constructive spirit once bushs proposals 
are on the table in vienna in september gerasimov added 
in a brief statement to reporters at kohls office gorbachev 
said that since kohls visit to moscow in october we have 
accomplished a lot weve worked together to reach this level of 
cooperation 
west german newspapers have heralded the gorbachev visit with 
much fanfare and television on monday broadcast live coverage of 
his arrival and several of the events on his first day 
the gorbachevs were greeted with a 21gun salute they 
encountered their first crowd of wellwishers a group of invited 
soviet children and west german exchange students outside the 
official residence of president richard von weizsaecker 
ordinary west germans were kept far away from the soviet leader 
by a tight cordon of security that had helicopters buzzing all day 
over the capital

health insurance companies will develop new 
policies to cover children of lowincome americans if a proposal to 
offer parents a tax credit of up to 500 to help pay for the 
premiums becomes law an industry official predicted monday 
mary nell lehnhard vice president of the blue cross and blue 
shield association told the senate finance committee there were an 
estimated 11 million children in the united states with no health 
insurance in 1985 about threefourths of them in familes with 
annual incomes of 20000 or less 
she said a survey of the associations 75 health plans nationwide 
suggested that roughly half of the small employers who provide some 
health insurance coverage for their workers do not pay anything 
toward coverage for their dependents 
in supporting a tax credit proposal by sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas ms lehnhard said the medicaid health program for the poor 
frequently forces parents to choose between going to work in a 
lowpaying job with unaffordable health benefits for themselves 
andor their dependents or remaining on medicaid to assure that 
their children have access to health care services 
adopting the finance committee chairmans plan she said would 
give families increased ability to purchase coverage for their 
children under employersponsored health plans and also allow more 
lowincome families to buy policies if there is no health plan where 
they work 
we believe that private health insurance markets will respond 
to these incentives by making available lowcost products with the 
objective of reaching children said ms lehnhard 
as an example she cited a blue shield of california program 
introduced last summer that establishes special rates for children 
in two age categories 1 to 4 years old and 5 to 18 
she said a typical policy covering a child 5 to 18 would cost the 
parent 250 a year for a child 1 to 4 the cost would be 320 
the bentsen bill to be acted on by the panel tuesday also would 
extend an existing child care tax credit to lower income workers by 
making them eligible for a cash refund if they did not have to pay 
enough federal income tax to take advantage of the benefit the way 
it is now structured 
willis b goldbeck president of the washington business group on 
health said the major employers his organization represents 
supports both the child care and health care tax credits in the 
bentsen bill 
he said the programs are intended for people most in need 
they are the ones trying hardest to maintain the american work 
ethic rather than falling prey to the cycle of poverty that we all 
know is far more expensive to society than the cost of your proposed 
tax credit he told bentsen

police on monday arrested about a dozen 
radical students who were trying to protest a police raid and the 
seizure of pronorth korea pamphlets 
about 600 students rallied at sogang university had tried to 
march to a nearby police station but about 1000 riot police 
carrying shields blocked their passage and made the arrests no 
injuries were reported 
police raided the university friday and seized more than 2000 
pamphlets on a youth festival to be held july 18 in pyongyang the 
capital of north korea 
the government has banned south koreans from taking part in the 
sports and cultural event but many students have said they will try 
to participate anyway the festival is for students from third world 
and communist nations 
the predawn raid came amid a crackdown on antigovernment 
protests 
at nearby yonsei university about 400 radical students rallied 
for two hours in front of the school then dispersed voluntarily 
they demanded the release of student leaders arrested by police on 
saturday in violent antigovernment street demonstrations police 
made no arrests 
in pusan the nations secondlargest city 800 students from two 
universities hurled rocks at riot police and denounced the 
government ban on attending the youth festival the yonhap news 
agency said police fired tear gas to break up the protests but no 
arrests or injuries were reported 
radical students and dissident leaders want the resignation of 
president roh taewoo and withdrawal of us troops stationed in 
south korea they say the united states supports an authoritarian 
government and blocks unification of the two nations 
the students have received little support because of their 
violent tactics 
in the southwestern city of kwangju an autopsy was performed on 
the charred body of a man found dead in a pool of paint thinner at 
chosun university the results of the autopsy were not released 
police said they suspected the man kim kyungchan 20 had 
committed suicide a friend said kim was suffering from an 
unspecified illness which might have prompted a suicide 
chosun has been hit by violent antigovernment protests since a 
student leader lee cholkyu was found dead at a reservoir near the 
city last month 
authorities have said lee drowned after fleeing police but 
students have said he may have been tortured lees death touched 
off violent street protests in kwangju 
also on monday roh warned that high salary increases and labor 
unrest are undermining the economy he appealed to employers and 
workers to show restraint and work together 
roh said labor unrest cost the economy 45 billion in lost 
production so far this year he said that figure included 1 billion 
in lost exports 
the wages of south korean workers have risen in the past two 
years after years of low salaries that gave its industry a major 
price advantage over other asian exporters

us military aid to noncommunist factions in 
cambodia should be increased from the 7 million now planned to as 
much as 30 million to help prevent the return to power of the khmer 
rouge rep stephen solarz dny said monday 
providing military assistance to noncommunist resistance 
forces will strengthen the ability of cambodians wishing to resist 
the khmer rouge after occupying vietnamese forces are withdrawn in 
september solarz told a senate foreign relations subcommittee 
these are cambodian forces who are willing to put their lives 
on the line in order to prevent a repetition of the khmer rouge 
holocaust solarz said dont we have a moral obligation to help 
them out 
solarz said he believes the 7 million in military aid sought by 
the bush administration is too little to do the job of strengthening 
anticommunist forces 
i would favor giving them more solarz said this is not a 
light or peripheral issue this is a matter of preventing another 
holocaust for starters i would provide somewhere between 20 
million to 30 million 
robert m kimmitt undersecretary of state for political affairs 
said the administration believes that strengthening the 
noncommunist resistance including prince norodom sihanouk 
cambodias former ruler will help achieve a peaceful political 
solution and prevent the return of the khmer rouge 
but other witnesses said they feared that military aid might fall 
into the hands of the khmer rouge and lead to the restoration of a 
regime blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
i am deeply skeptical of the wisdom of such a policy said 
sen alan cranston dcalif the subcommittee chairman i reject 
the notion that the best means of dealing with the volatile and 
potentially violent situation in southeast asia is to inject 
military aid 
providing military aid would add a potentially explosive 
element of instability into the process cranston said 
richard holbrooke who was assistant secretary of state for asian 
affairs in the carter administration said he also believes that 
arming the noncommunist forces would be a mistake 
i believe we are headed toward a situation where the khmer 
rouge will be invited to participate in a coalition government in 
cambodia he said 
and he said he feared that a limited amount of military aid to 
an incompetent military force leads us to a later dilemma do we 
increase that aid or do we continue it at all 
but solarz said that because of the desire to prevent a 
repetition of the the killings of the past we are dealing with 
one of the transcendental moral issues of our time 
he said by providing arms to sihanouk and the noncommunist 
resistance the united states would simultaneously strengthen their 
position at the negotiating table

former president ronald reagan has been offered an 
honorary knighthood and has accepted the highest royal honor britain 
bestows on americans burkes peerage said monday 
reagan who is in london on his first visit since leaving the 
white house in january will be the guest of queen elizabeth ii at a 
buckingham palace lunch wednesday but nobody would say whether she 
would give him an award 
harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage 
which chronicles the british aristocracy said we understand it 
has been offered and will be accepted either this trip or his next 
trip which is expected to be next spring 
asked whether it was likely to be announced this week he said 
i think its very likely but we dont know 
buckingham palace and reagans press spokesman mark weinberg 
referred all queries to the foreign office where a spokesman said 
i simply do not know whether the queen is going to give president 
reagan a knighthood 
british honors such as knighthoods are awarded by the queen 
although most are made on the recommendation of prime minister 
margaret thatcher buckingham palace said awards to foreign 
officials must be recommended by the foreign office 
brooksbaker said reagan was offered a knighthood because 
because of his special contribution to the british government under 
mrs thatcher he helped mrs thatcher in the falklands war and in 
many different ways 
the united states provided naval intelligence communications 
facilities and political support to britain during its 1982 war 
against argentina over the falkland islands in the south atlantic 
several members of mrs thatchers conservative party have urged 
that reagan be given a high british honor 
lawmaker harry greenway said such an honor would be not only in 
recognition of his unique special relationship with britain but also 
to mark his massive contribution to world peace 
if reagan receives an honorary knighthood he would be the 57th 
american to receive the award joining his former secretary of 
defense caspar weinberger who was made a knight in 1988 fellow 
actors douglas fairbanks jr and sidney poitier president dwight d 
eisenhower and philanthropists paul mellon and john paul getty ii 
an honorary knighthood wouldnt mean reagan could call himself 
sir ronald that accolade is reserved for the queens own subjects 
although brooksbaker insists there is nothing in us law 
preventing reagan or any other american from using a british title 
reagan will deliver a lecture tuesday on the problems and 
challenges confronting the englishspeaking world afterward he and 
his wife nancy will be guests at a dinner given by mrs thatcher

the united nations began one of its most 
ambitious repatriation operations monday bringing hundreds of 
namibian exiles home to participate in the territorys independence 
process 
the first plane arriving at the windhoek airport from lusaka 
zambia brought about 150 refugees including adults who have lived 
abroad for more than a decade and children who set foot on namibian 
soil for the first time 
the un high commission for refugees sought to repatriate more 
than 1300 refugees on 11 flights monday but several flights were 
canceled after delays and only about 700 refugees returned 
officials said 
they are all in very good health and they are all very happy 
said nicolas bwakira the un official in charge of the airlift 
who greeted the first batch of returnees 
the united nations has registered 41000 namibian refugees at 
camps in neighboring angola zambia and botswana the world body 
wants to bring back more than 1000 refugees a day for the next six 
weeks under the independence plan for africas last colony which 
has been ruled by south africa for 74 years 
in addition to the airlift hundreds of refugees have crossed the 
border from angola on foot namibian officials said 
the returning refugees were greeted at the airport by about 250 
demonstrators wearing the red blue and green colors of the 
southwest africa peoples organization guerrilla movement 
swapo fought a 23year bush war with the south african security 
forces and now is the most powerful political faction in namibia 
the demonstrators included women who sang and men who chanted 
proswapo slogans they held up signs that pictured swapo leader sam 
nujoma and read welcome home swapo freedom fighters 
un troops from kenya kept the crowd behind ropes as the 
refugees went through customs and boarded buses for the 30mile trip 
to the doebra refugee camp outside windhoek 
a tent city was built as temporary shelter for the refugees on 
the grounds of a roman catholic mission buses carrying the first 
group of refugees were met by about 400 students from the mission 
school 
the students sang and danced outside the compound where the 
refugees lined up to receive ration cards and blankets from un 
workers 
un officials have said they expect the refugees to leave the 
camp and join relatives within a week 
another demonstration took place at a busy highway intersection 
at the camp entrance about 15 members of the parents committee of 
namibia held up signs demanding swapo account for more than 100 
people who joined the organization but have not been heard from 
swapo where is my son said a sign held by a man who added 
that his 18yearold son left to join the organization eight years

the supreme court on monday agreed to consider 
reinstating a 61 million award against the arthur young amp co 
accounting firm won by investors in the farmers cooperative of 
arkansas and oklahoma 
the justices said they will review a federal appeals court ruling 
that threw out the award on grounds the notes held by the coops 
investors are not securities under federal or arkansas law 
sold for many years to thousands of farmers by the coop the 
notes were uninsured payable on demand and yielded only interest 
when the coop filed for bankruptcy protection in 1984 about 
1600 of its 23000 members held notes they had purchased for more 
than 10 million 
among other legal actions investors filed a class action 
lawsuit against arthur young amp co which audited the coops 1981 
and 1982 financial statements and issued reports on those statements 
the lawsuit alleged that the accounting firm had fraudulently 
misled investors about the coops financial strength 
a federal judge ruled that the notes were securities under state 
and federal law ruled for the investors and federal jury awarded 
the investors about 61 million in compensatory damages 
but the 8th us circuit court of appeals last year reversed the 
award ruling that the coops notes are not securities under 
federal or state law 
the case is reves vs arthur young amp co 881480

a judge convicted an obstetrician of 
infanticide monday for failing to try to keep alive a baby who 
witnesses said survived for about 90 minutes after a 1984 abortion 
on a 13yearold 
the verdict by common pleas judge lynn abraham after a 13week 
nonjury trial was announced without comment or explanation 
i find you guilty as charged of the crime of infanticide she 
told 66yearold dr joseph melnick 
it was the first criminal prosecution under pennsylvanias 1974 
abortion law which requires doctors to do what they can if they 
remove a living fetus 
the law was enacted after the us supreme court in the 1973 case 
roe v wade found prohibitive abortion laws unconstitutional 
no sentencing date was set melnick who showed no emotion and 
declined to comment could receive a maximum prison sentence of 3 
to 7 years 
he originally was charged with murder but that charge was 
dismissed on grounds of insufficient evidence and the abortion law 
was invoked 
melnick testified he was told his young patient was in her fourth 
month of pregnancy when actually it was the eighth month state law 
prohibits most abortions after six months of pregnancy he also said 
the 3pound 9ounce girl was stillborn 
but other members of the west park hospital staff where the 
abortion was performed said they detected a heartbeat and claimed 
they saw the baby move and gasp 
i dont think he made a mistake said assistant district 
attorney andrea foulkes i think he made a deliberate choice not 
to act 
defense attorney richard sprague said he would appeal and 
suggested the conviction was the product of frustration raised 
over the abortion issue

two earthquakes a halfhour apart shook 
southern california on monday knocking items off shelves cracking 
the plaster in city hall disrupting phone service and prompting 
workers to evacuate offices 
there were no reports of serious damage or injuries 
a quake measuring 45 on the richter scale struck at 957 am 
and was followed by a 43magnitude aftershock at 1025 the quakes 
were on the same fault as the whittier narrows quake and its 
aftershock that killed eight people in 1987 
it was like a ride at magic mountain where it just shakes and 
shakes said joseph libby in torrance about 15 miles south of 
downtown los angeles some things fell off shelves like books 
but i cant see any real damage 
their epicenter was about 10 miles southeast of downtown in 
montebello said kate hutton a seismologist at california institute 
of technology 
the quakes which were felt as far east as banning 85 miles from 
downtown temporarily knocked out the caltech seismology labs 
hotline to the california department of emergency services as well 
as other phone lines hutton said 
the quake was classified as moderate but because it was centered 
in the densely populated los angeles basin it rattled millions of 
people 
the tremor shook city hall violently for 12 to 15 seconds 
knocking plaster down at the nearby hall of administration many of 
those attending a board of supervisors meeting scurried into the 
streets as the jolts sprinkled the room with plaster guards ordered 
everyone out of the room as a precaution 
other downtown buildings also had cracked and falling plaster 
it was like a bouncing feeling said mavis lopez a 
receptionist in a 51stfloor office in the wells fargo building i 
saw people running out of their offices but everybody knew what it 
was and they were relatively calm 
at the first jolt los angeles fire trucks pulled out of their 
garages and went out patrolling neighborhoods for damage said 
spokesman greg acevedo our helicopters are in the air to check 
for damage at the reserviors he said 
no significant damage was reported in checks with police and 
sheriffs stations and firehouses 
los angeles building codes are such that 45s should not cause 
any serious damage hutton said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 can cause slight damage 4 moderate damage 
5 considerable damage 6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major 
earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage 8 is a great 
quake capable of tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 
mondays earthquakes were about six miles west of whittier where 
a 59magnitude quake struck oct 1 1987 and a 53 aftershock oct 
4 caused 358 million in damage eight deaths and 200 injuries

a judge monday dismissed one of 10 perjury counts 
against former rep pat swindall as the defense began its case 
us district judge richard c freeman called the count just 
too confusing for a jury trial 
the judge also threw out more than half an hour of testimony 
monday by a defense witness rep barney frank dmass who 
discussed the knowledge that congressmen do and do not have 
regarding the details of legislation 
swindall was indicted on charges of lying to a federal grand jury 
in 1988 about negotiating a loan in 1987 from an agent posing as a 
money launderer prosecutors said swindall lied in denying he was 
told some of the money might have come from drug trafficking 
the dismissed charge said swindall lied when he testified that he 
knew little about gulf coast mortgage corp the company created by 
a swindall associate to funnel the 850000 loan to swindall from 
the agent 
swindall if convicted faces up to five years in prison on each 
of the remaining nine counts 
the defense opened its case monday by calling frank one of at 
least three members of congress subpoenaed by the defense 
frank explained that members of congress have little knowledge of 
the nutsandbolts of the hundreds of bills congress considers each 
year unless their specific subcommittees are involved 
the prosecution has argued that swindall a former member of the 
house banking and judiciary committees should have been especially 
aware of moneylaundering laws 
frank said no human being could know the details of more 
than 20 percent of the bills before congress 
frank a member of the banking committee testified that swindall 
was not a member of the subcommittee that handled the 
moneylaundering act passed in 1986 
but he said a wellinformed member would know we were including 
in the drug bill efforts to stop criminals from laundering money 
and getting cute 
freeman said he would order the jury to disregard franks 
testimony because it could open the pandoras box of matters 
protected by the constitutions clause guarding the speech and 
debate activities of congress

authorities have effectively snuffed out 
the studentled democracy movement in chinas largest city through a 
campaign of intimidation and arrests protest supporters said monday 
the last symbol of the popular uprising an 8foot model of the 
statue of liberty that had been paraded around the streets last 
month was torn down monday at the direction of the city government 
the styrofoam statue stood for the past few weeks at shanghais 
fudan university about 100 yards away from a statue of communist 
chinas founder mao tsetung 
many protest leaders have gone into hiding or left the city as 
authorities sweep through shanghai making arrests that are reported 
in official media students also have reported many arrests 
protests in shanghai continued after chinese troops broke up 
student protests in beijing on june 34 about 3000 people died in 
the capital most of them students according to chinese and western 
diplomatic estimates the chinese government says 300 died most of 
them soldiers 
martial law has been in effect in beijing since may 20 but has 
not been declared elsewhere in china during the crisis 
but widespread arrests were reported 
theyre arresting students so all our leaders have run off 
said a student at fudan university which along with shanghais 
tongji university is considered the most activist its all over 
for now but theyll be back 
a fellow student said the government frightened students into 
going underground as soon as the government makes a serious move 
like arresting people no one dares show his face he said 
the protests in shanghai while large lacked the fervor of the 
emotional demonstrations in beijing 
after a few marches we dont have the momentum that beijing 
has said a 21yearold factory worker theyre at the center of 
government and that keeps them going 
security authorities have rounded up at least 150 people in 
shanghai in the last three days mostly workers who took part in 
street demonstrations according to staterun media reports 
warnings to students appeared in shanghai newspapers monday 
ordering student masterminds to disband the outlawed shanghai 
independent student union and turn themselves in 
one of those reported arrested in chinas press was identified as 
yao yongzhan a fudan university student who heads an outlawed 
student union a resident of hong kong he was stopped at shanghais 
airport sunday when he showed up for a flight to hong kong with 
several british students and british consulate officials 
we did not know anything about him until he appeared yesterday 
morning saying he hadnt gotten enough money a spokesman for the 
british embassy in beijing said the consulate in shanghai loaned 
yao money and gave him a ride to the airport the spokesman said 
police have also cracked down on workers who helped students move 
dozens of buses into place last week creating havoc on shanghais 
already swollen streets eleven leaders of the banned labor union 
have been arrested according to police 
since the formation of the workers autonomous union members 
have carried out activities opposing the peoples government 
disrupting social order economy and public safety and destroying 
public property the liberation daily quoted an unidentified 
shanghai police official as saying 
on friday 50000 people marched in shanghai in the largest 
protest since the assault in beijing students gave the government 
48 hours to begin direct talks with the students on publicizing the 
democracy movement and the events in beijing and to lower flags in 
shanghai to halfstaff 
but the government ignored the ultimatum and the students 
havent ventured forth since 
on monday night about 200 workers recruited by the government to 
maintain security gathered at the gates of the tongji campus they 
insisted they were there to keep traffic flowing smoothly 
they had been in place since 600 am sunday clearly to prevent 
tongji students from marching out of the school as the 48hour 
deadline aproached 
much information about the protests outside of government 
channels appears to be coming from hong kong the british colony 
scheduled to revert to chinese rule in 1997 
supporters of the movement in hong kong regularly send to china 
by facsimile machines copies of hong kong newspaper stories about 
the democracy movement

the supreme court gave white men significant 
new power monday to challenge courtapproved affirmative action 
plans even years after they take effect 
the 54 decision in a case from birmingham ala represented the 
third major civil rights setback in the high court this year for 
racial minorities and women 
civil rights advocates assailed the ruling and complained that a 
solidified conservative court majority led by former president 
reagans appointees was reopening old racial wounds 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
white birmingham firefighters are entitled to their day in court to 
try to prove they are victims of reverse racial bias 
affirmative action plans agreed to by birmingham officials and 
approved by court decree in 1981 may be attacked in a new suit by 
workers who took no part in the case leading to the original 
agreement rehnquist said 
in contrast the justices killed by a 53 vote a 
sexdiscrimination suit by three women who work at an atampt plant in 
illinois 
relying on a highly technical interpretation of federal civil 
rights law the justices said the women waited too long to claim 
that changes in a seniority system discriminated illegally against 
them 
in the birmingham case rehnquist said a judgment or decree 
among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them but it 
does not conclude the rights of strangers to those proceedings 
he dismissed arguments that permitting white men to reopen 
settled affirmative action cases would destroy the incentive for 
employers to take steps benefiting women and minorities 
justice john paul stevens in a dissenting opinion said the 
ruling would subject large employers who seek to comply with the 
law by remedying past discrimination to a neverending stream of 
litigation and potential liability 
reacting to the decision rep don edwards dcalif said the 
court is dealing blow after blow to 25 years of progress in civil 
rights law 
longsettled cases now have no degree of finality or 
certainty edwards said this decision will open old wounds and 
create unfortunate new levels of racial animosity 
in a separate case the court in january ruled that state and 
local governments generally may not impose racial quotas for public 
works projects and just a week ago the court erected new barriers 
for minorities seeking to prove with statistics that they are 
relegated to lowerpaying less desirable jobs 
in mondays decision rehnquist was joined by justices byron r 
white sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
the latter three are reagan appointees 
dissenting with stevens were justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun 
in a separate 54 ruling monday white joined with those four 
more liberal members to rule that sentencing juries generally may 
not be told about the crime victims personal characteristics 
the court said a south carolina murderer unfairly was sentenced 
to death after a prosecutor told jurors that the victim was a 
religious communityminded person 
in other action the court 
refused to let montana sheep owners kill grizzly bears 
threatening their herds the court rejected arguments that the 
owners have a constitutional right to protect their property even 
if it means killing animals designated an endangered species 
turned away the case of a marine who died after his wisdom tooth 
was pulled the court left intact a legal doctrine barring members 
of the military from suing over injuries suffered incident to 
service 
refused to block the extradition to hong kong of a california 
man accused of falsifying accounts while chairman of a bank in the 
british crown colony the man had argued that his extradition could 
subject him to additional prosecution when hong kong is returned to 
chinese control in 1997 
the birmingham case began in 1974 when city officials and the 
jefferson county personnel board were sued by blacks who charged 
racial bias in the city fire department 
eventually both sides agreed on an extensive plan that included 
longterm and interim goals for hiring blacks as firefighters and 
promoting blacks to higher ranks the plan also included provisions 
to help women advance 
the birmingham firefighters association opposed the plan but its 
objections were rejected by a federal judge who issued consent 
decrees in 1981 approving the agreement 
at the time the citys 453 firefighters included 42 blacks none 
of the departments 140 lieutenants captains or battalion chiefs 
was black 
seven white firefighters then challenged the promotion plan 
saying lessqualified blacks were being promoted ahead of them 
a federal judge ruling that the white firefighters were bound by 
the court consent decree dismissed their suit but the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in late 1987 reinstated the suit 
mondays ruling does not doom the affirmative action plan but 
forces city and county officials to defend it at a new trial

the state department on monday challenged 
chinese assertions that its troops did not fire on prodemocracy 
students massed in tiananmen square the whole world has seen what 
happened said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
seizing the offensive the department also chastized senior 
leader deng xiaoping even as the united states pressed efforts to 
find a diplomatic solution for two dissidents sheltered in the us 
embassy in beijing and threatened with arrest 
were trying to resolve it a senior us official said of 
the case of fang lizhi an astrophysicist critical of the chinese 
government and his wife li shuxian an assistant professor at 
beijing university 
they were accused of counterrevolutionary activities and 
warrants for their arrest were issued on sunday 
stepping into the dispute secretary of state james a baker iii 
called han xu the chinese ambassador to his office saturday the 
envoy was summoned back sunday for a talk with robert kimmitt the 
undersecretary of state for political affairs ms tutwiler said 
reading a statement that reversed days of a deliberately 
lowkeyed us approach to the tumult in china the spokeswoman 
declared 
the whole world has seen what happened in tiananmen square 
large numbers of peaceful demonstrators were killed by army units 
we condemn the use of live fire against unarmed civilians which is 
what happened in tiananmen square 
the spokeswoman said the demonstrators were seeking basic human 
rights labeling such people counterrevolutionaries and hooligans 
will do nothing to alter the reality of what happened in tiananmen 
square on june 3 she said 
the chinese government has said that about 300 people were killed 
in the assault and that most were soldiers other estimates place 
the death toll as high as 3000 
ms tutwiler also had sharp words for deng xiaoping chinas 
senior leader who emerged from more than three weeks of seclusion 
friday to praise the armys suppression of prodemocracy forces 
the performance cast doubt on dengs reputation as a cautious but 
ardent advocate of reforming the marxist system ms tutwiler said 
if deng was responsible for the brutal attack on tiananmen square 
then he has acted to undercut the very reform process he has sought 
to foster 
baker and kimmitt a close aide were believed in their meetings 
with ambassador han to be exploring ways to arrange safe passage 
from china for fang the countrys best known dissident and his 
wife but us officials concerned about the couples welfare 
declined to discuss the case 
earlier a us official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
indicated the united states would not permit chinese authorities to 
arrest the two dissidents 
when a person presents himself to one of our embassies and says 
he is imminent danger and we have reason to give it credence 
sometimes we grant refuge a us official said and when we do 
that i ask you what does it mean 
the charges against the dissidents could amount to accusations of 
treason and amid the turmoil in china carry the threat of a death 
sentence 
the beijing government has warned that leaders of independent 
groups who refuse to surrender would be arrested and dealt with 
severely 
meanwhile the department reported that chinese police and other 
security forces had surrounded the us embassy in an obvious effort 
to keep other dissidents from taking refuge there 
james lilley the us ambassador to china declined to discuss 
the fang situation in an interview on abctvs good morning 
america 
its too sensitive he said if you get up and start 
posturing it lessens the chance of getting something done 
in a separate interview with nbctvs today program lilley 
said he hoped the dispute over fang and li was out of the way 
fairly soon 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said when asked 
about fang its our judgment its not helpful in any way to 
comment 
by the latest estimate one us official said about 1100 
americans are still in china all who wanted to leave are gone or 
are on their way out ms tutwiler said over the weekend 159 
americans joined the exodus

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
on monday proposed ecological cooperation with west germany that 
would include exchanges of technology and emergency assistance in 
case of an environmental disaster 
speaking at a dinner given by west german chancellor helmut kohl 
gorbachev said the scientifictechnical and economic possibilities 
of the ussr and west germany would have a huge meaning in 
europes effort to combat pollution 
any agreement would more directly benefit the soviet unions new 
ecology program than the wellestablished west german effort 
the soviets environmental protection agency was created only 
last year and still lacks the finances and many of the powers it 
needs to crack down on polluters 
soviet officials said last month they were finishing a 
comprehensive environmental protection package but they were still 
working out technical options for factories to reduce effluence 
gorbachev suggested the soviets and west germany could conduct 
research to develop joint ventures to build pollution control 
equipment process wastes exchange information between regions and 
cities in the two countries agree on a program of urgent aid in 
case of accidents and develop working groups to help form an 
alleurope environmental policy 
gorbachev praised the efforts of french president francois 
mitterrand and west germanys opposition social democrats and 
greens parties to work out international environmental agreements 
he did not mention kohls christian democratic union which has been 
slower to formulate environmental protection policies 
thousands of soviet citizens have participated in demonstrations 
protesting decades of rushed industrial production that ignored 
environmental consequences 
soviet officials have said 50 million people live in cities where 
air pollution sometimes exceeds acceptable limits by 10 times and 
the countrys main waterways are dying because of the dumping of 
industrial wastes 
environmental activists say overuse of pesticides and chemical 
fertilizers are poisoning the food soviets eat 
gorbachev and other government leaders were criticized repeatedly 
on the ecology issue by parliamentarians during the congress of 
peoples deputies session that ended friday 
germans are concerned about soviet environmental policies 
especially after the april 1986 chernobyl nuclear powerplant 
disaster the explosion and fire at the chernobyl plant in the 
northern ukraine killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of 
radiation that spread around the world

we suspect it was the work of the babbar khalsa said police 
commisssioner vn singh the babbar khalsa is one of the 
underground militias fighting for an independent sikh nation in the 
northern state of punjab 
we did suspect this kind of thing singh said there was 
some information from intelligence agencies there was an alert but 
our arrangements cannot be foolproof 
singh said whoever planted the bomb could have boarded a train 
after dropping the device in the hall 
press trust of india quoted a witness pawan kumar as saying he 
saw a man with a mustache ask someone to look after his briefcase 
and a wooden crate while he went to drink water a few minutes later 
the bomb exploded in the same spot the news agency quoted kumar as 
saying 
sandals sunglasses and food was strewn across the entrance hall 
floor blood splattered the halls 60foothigh ceiling and a 
100squarefoot section of the floor 
it was like hell said ramesh kumar who was in the hall but 
escaped injury i thought i was seeing a bad bloody movie

blocks were set up on major roads and vehicles were checked 
police made announcements at crowded markets and the capitals 
main bus station warning people to stay away from suspicious objects

sikh militants have been fighting for an independent homeland 
since 1982 claiming discrimination by the countrys hindu majority 
they have been blamed in at least 850 killings in punjab state this 
year and for sporadic attacks in the capital in previous years 
the 1984 raid on the sikh golden temple was aimed at flushing out 
armed militants entrenched in the shrine and left at least 1200 
people dead many of them sikhs less than five months later prime 
minister indira gandhi was assassinated by sikh bodyguards in 
retaliation 
the last major sikh attack in new delhi occurred on june 20 
1988 when sikh militants hurled a homemade grenade into a crowded 
vegetable market four people were killed and more than 40 wounded

columnist jack anderson who pulled out a gun 
during an interview with senate minority leader bob dole to 
illustrate what he termed lax security was criticized monday by 
fellow journalists who called his ploy a cheap shot 
capitol police say they may file criminal charges against 
anderson in connection with the may 24 incident and the committee 
that hands out media credentials is considering revoking andersons 
privileges 
i think it was a cheap shot bob franken of cable news 
network said about the incident calling it a trivialization of 
journalism 
the police here do a good job they have an impossible task 
franken said we have some horrendous issues to try to comprehend 
here this was jack anderson making a quick buck 
kenan block a producer for macneillehrer newshour said in an 
interview that he did a similar story on airport security when he 
was reporting for a local station 
its a cheap shot he said its kind of a cliche i 
thought anderson would do a more sophisticated story 
al freeman of mutual broadcasting called andersons technique a 
stunt 
freeman said someone such as anderson a nationally syndicated 
columnist is known and might have an easier time getting into the 
capitol without as thorough a check as lesserknown individuals 
anderson said in a telephone interview monday that he did not 
carry the gun into the building himself because he realized there 
was a possibility he would be recongized and therefore not checked 
as carefully as a person not known to security officers 
he said the accomplice who carried the weapon was with the 
anderson party but went in far enough ahead of me i dont think 
that person would have been associated with me the accomplice was 
not named 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and dole 
rkan have threatened to require more timeconsuming searches of 
the media if the credentials committee doesnt deter any future 
repetition of this act 
jeffrey birnbaum chairman of the fivemember panel that oversees 
assigning credentials to about 2000 reporters said the group would 
hold a hearing no date has been set 
we could do nothing reprimand him or take away his 
credentials birnbaum said for us the issue is narrow did he 
abuse his position as a reporter 
capitol police officer dan nichols said anderson could be charged 
with possession of a gun inside the capitol a felony punishable by 
a 5000 fine five years in jail or both lesser charges also are 
being considered he said 
i think its sad that once again they would go after the 
journalist who exposes a problem instead of correcting the 
problem anderson said in the telephone interview 
i have been told by journalists that their the authorities 
way of correcting the problem is to double and triple and quadruple 
security on journalists it seems they are punishing all because one 
exposed a faulty security system 
anderson addd that the publicity probably does me good but i 
would rather avoid it 
the incident occurred during taping for his syndicated television 
show on which the topic was terrorism 
anderson was interviewing dole in a private office when he pulled 
the austrianmade part plastic gun out of his pocket said dole 
spokesman walt riker 
dole was surprised as anyone would be riker said but the 
senator had just made the point that the building is not failsafe 
and thats why we have to be ever vigilant 
nichols said officers have not changed procedures since the 
incident 
all visitors have their packages checked and pass through metal 
detectors he said

farmers are harvesting a winter wheat crop 
estimated at an 11year low of 141 billion bushels down 10 percent 
from last years harvest and 2 percent below the may forecast the 
agriculture department said monday 
the new estimate based on june 1 surveys compared with last 
months forecast of 143 billion bushels and the 1988 winter wheat 
harvest of 156 billion bushels 
the next estimate will be july 12 
officials said the average yield based on june 1 conditions was 
estimated at 345 bushels per acre compared with 349 bushels per 
acre estimated in may and last years per acre average of 392 
bushels 
farmers are expected to have about 408 million acres for harvest 
this year up 3 percent from 398 million acres in 1988 the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its report 
once again we see evidence of a significant shortfall in the 
wheat crop on an expanded area said carl schwensen executive 
vice president of the national association of wheat growers the 
outlook is not likely to improve from this point onward 
winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested the next summer 
makes up about threefourths of total us wheat production the 
remainder is planted in the spring 
next months crop report will include production estimates for 
springplanted wheat thus providing the first 1989 look at total 
us wheat output 
the first estimates of 1989 output of corn soybeans cotton and 
other major crops will be issued aug 10 
lingering drought and lateseason freezes crippled much of the 
winter wheat crop in parts of the great plains notably in kansas 
where this years harvest was estimated at 2024 million bushels 
that was unchanged from may indications but far below last years 
harvest of 323 million bushels 
the continuing effects of drought in kansas and some other states 
have stirred demands for federal aid comparable to the 39 billion 
emergency measure passed by congress last year to help cover 1988 
losses 
legislation has been introduced to expand 1989 drought 
assistance but the administration has opposed any massive 
rapidfire remedies until more is known about the crop situation 
schwensen said the june winter wheat report highlights once 
again the need for federal disaster legislation 
the skimpy wheat outlook is not expected to have a major impact 
on the price of bread or other food products according to usda 
economists 
overall they expect consumer food prices to increase an average 
of 5 percent to 7 percent in 1989 compared with last years average 
gain of 41 percent higher vegetable prices stemming from severe 
winter cold and lingering effects of last years drought are major 
factors 
in a related supplyanddemand report usda projected total 1989 
wheat production a figure based on assumptions of normal weather 
and trend yields at about 203 billion bushels up from last 
years 181 billion bushels that was down slightly from the may 
projection 
the report showed that wheat prices could rise to an average of 
380 per bushel to 420 per bushel in 198990 from 374 per 
bushel in the wheat marketing year that ended may 31 
with higher prices ahead wheat exports could decline to 115 
billion bushels from 144 billion bushels in 198889 the report 
said the us wheat stockpile june 1 1990 would be down to about 
500 million bushels from 616 million bushels on hand this june 1

three republicans scrambled from the 
mountains to the coast on the eve of a primary tuesday to decide who 
will oppose lt gov l douglas wilder in his bid to become the 
nations first elected black governor 
former us sen paul s trible jr former attorney general j 
marshall coleman and us rep stanford e parris looked for a 
lastminute edge in the tight race in virginias first gop 
gubernatorial primary in 40 years 
meanwhile wilder and his running mates opened a getacquainted 
tour of the state just two days after winning the democratic 
nomination 
trible 42 had led all polls until last week but two surveys 
published as coleman turned 47 on thursday put him about even with 
trible parris 59 was was close enough to the leaders to fall 
within the polls sampling errors 
a poll released last week showed each of the three gop contenders 
leading wilder but only slightly wilder is nurturing his image as 
an underdog a tactic which helped parlay him into the lieutenant 
governorship in 1985 
the nation has not had a black governor since reconstruction and 
has never actually elected one lt gov pinckney pinchback of 
louisiana became acting governor in 187273 after gov henry 
warmouth was removed from office 
because voter rolls do not designate party all of the states 
26 million registered voters are eligible to cast ballots in 
tuesdays primary but few are predicting a big turnout of 
republicans much less democrats 
susan fitzhugh secretary of the board of elections predicted 
that turnout could be as low as 250000 or less than 10 percent 
but parris and a top trible aide judy peachee said they 
expected as many as 350000 to vote 
wilder has played down the racial aspect of the contest as have 
the gop contenders political experts have said wilder has at least 
an even chance of winning in virginia which is 82 percent white 
wilder was elected in 1985 on the same ticket as gov gerald l 
baliles who is barred by the state constitution from seeking a 
second consecutive term 
the three gop candidates have raised almost 10 million for the 
primary which republican leaders chose instead of a convention in a 
bid to recapture the executive mansion that has been the home of 
democrats since 1982 
trible speaking monday during the busy lunch hour in richmonds 
downtown financial district continued to press an electability 
message he said a coleman or parris win in the primary would give 
the nov 7 election to wilder 
parris meantime said the forecast for rain probably would work 
to his advantage since bad weather tends to hurt turnout in rural 
areas where he is weakest we think were peaking at exactly the 
right time he said 
coleman was endorsed monday by the washington times which cited 
his more aggressive and specific advocacy of reforms in welfare 
education and criminal justice 
wilder 58 was nominated for governor saturday at a harmonious 
state democratic convention 
asked which republican he would prefer to face wilder said he 
would take on any of them and that he would not encourage his 
supporters to vote in the gop primary 
wilder a grandson of slaves who grew up in segregated richmond 
and attended howard university law school in washington on a state 
stipend because he could not go to virginias allwhite law schools 
has portrayed himself as a social moderate and fiscal conservative 
the wilder nomination is giving virginians an opportunity to 
put the era of racial discrimination behind them said tom morris 
a university of richmond political scientist

hundreds of arabs 
lined up monday to collect armyissued computerized identity cards 
despite a call by underground palestinian leaders to fight their 
distribution 
some palestinians claimed soldiers coerced them to accept the new 
cards and others said they would be denied jobs without them 
residents of the israelioccupied gaza strip are barred from 
entering israel without the cards that are designed to increase 
control of their movements government officials said the system may 
be expanded to also cover the occupied west bank 
the daily haaretz newspaper reported monday that the army plans 
to extend from six months to one year the maximum period imprisoned 
arab can be held without trial the change is part of a legal 
crackdown on the palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the 
occupied lands the paper said 
an army spokesman refused to comment on the report 
there are now 1508 arabs being held under israels 
administrative detention procedures according to official 
reports the united states and international human rights groups 
condemn the practice as a violation of due process of the law 
army gunfire wounded six palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
strip on monday including two 14yearold boys arab hospital 
officials said 
at least 516 palestinians have been killed and more than 10000 
wounded since the uprising began in december 1987 twentytwo 
israelis also have been slain in the violence 
at a military base at this crossing into the gaza strip 
palestinians sat in long rows in a building waiting to get the new 
identity cards 
the red green and white plastic cards are being issued only to 
gaza men over the age of 16 who have paid all their taxes and do not 
have criminal records the army said 
col ami levy who is directing the distribution said cards will 
be denied to palestinians who have served more than five months of 
administrative detention 
he estimated that 2000 arabs would be denied cards 
its an honesty card said levy everyone who has one is 
regarded as cleared by the administration to work and visit in 
israel 
in a leaflet distributed sunday the clandestine leadership of 
the palestinian uprising accused israeli authorities of renewing 
their nazi and fascist activities with the cards and said the 
effort would be opposed 
the army began issuing the cards last week levy said arabs must 
pay 20 shekels 11 for each card 
the cards are critical for the estimated 50000 gazans who work 
in israel 
atef a palestinian in his 30s who would give only that name 
said soldiers forced him to come to the base but he acknowledged he 
needed the card to work in israel

a couples practice of polygamy is no 
reason to bar them from adopting six motherless children a lawyer 
told utahs supreme court on monday 
the judge should have considered vaughn and sharane fischers 
other qualifications as parents and the interests of the children 
who have lived with them two years said attorney david nuffer 
representing the fischers 
but timothy anderson representing relatives who oppose the 
adoption called plural marriage anathema to society 
oral arguments before the states highest court took place in a 
courtroom overflowing with friends and relatives 
the fischers sought to adopt the children ages 5 to 19 after 
the 1987 cancer death of their mother brenda thornton who married 
fischer 54 three months before her death and assigned custody to 
his family with consent from the childrens biological father 
circuit judge dean e conder ruled in december that while the 
department of social services found the couple capable their 
polygamist lifestyle disqualified them the judge stayed his 
decision pending an appeal 
the children remain in the polygamist town of hildale near the 
arizona border with the fischers who share their home with plural 
wife katarina stubbs and 15 children 
the question of what is best for the children is central to the 
issue nuffer said further he said ms thorntons marriage to 
fischer was based on her specific desire and purpose to bring 
her children into the family 
anderson countered that polygamy was ended for good reason in the 
19th century because it ran counter to societys commitment to 
monogamy 
the mormon church dropped polygamy as a tenet of its faith in 
1890 in exchange for statehood and it is proscribed in the utah 
constitution 
however an estimated 20000 to 30000 mormons still practice 
plural marriage at risk of excommuncation 
the law against polygamy has not been actively enforced for more 
than three decades 
anderson said said the case hinges not on the fischers right to 
their fundamentalist mormon beliefs but on the states 
responsibility to protect children from being taught illegal 
practices 
ms thorntons stepsister pat johanson of washington claims 
that transfer of the children to the fischers was signed under 
pressure from the fundamentalists and that ms thornton really 
wanted her to take the children 
ms johanson said her stepsister confided her true wishes in the 
weeks before her death but feared being excommunicated 
ms johansons sister janet johanson of salem ore is seeking 
to adopt the children

a study has found that nearly all 
nonsmokers have traces of a nicotine derivative in their systems 
most of them from exposdure to smoke at work and in public places 
scientists said monday 
that indicates restrictions on public smoking can reduce the 
threat of smoke to nonsmokers they said 
nearly all the 663 nonsmokers in the 1986 study had traces of a 
nicotine derivative in their urine said researchers at roswell park 
memorial institute 
this means they had had a recent exposure to tobacco smoke 
said dr k michael cummings who conducted the study what that 
means is exposure to tobacco smoke among nonsmokers at least in 
the western new york area is ubiquitous 
the percentage of smokers in the buffalo area is about the 
national average meaning the studys findings should be reflective 
of the country as a whole cummings said 
studies have linked passive smoke exposure to a wide range of 
health problems including eye and nose irritation respiratory 
infections in infants and children and increased risks of heart 
disease and cancer 
cummings said 91 percent of the buffaloarea nonsmokers 
interviewed over a year had traces of cotinine a breakdown product 
of nicotine in their urine 
what surprised researchers is that only 76 percent of the 
nonsmokers reported they had been exposed to tobacco smoke in the 
four days previous to the study 
even among those individuals who did not live with a smoker 
84 percent had evidence of cotinine in their urine which was 
indicative of exposures probably occurring outside the home 
cummings said 
in the study researchers interviewed nonsmoking volunteers who 
had gone to roswell park as part of a cancer screening clinic 
combining the 28 percent who said their exposure to smoke came at 
work with the 16 those who said their exposure came in restaurants 
and 8 percent in public buildings cummings said more than half of 
the reported exposures occurred in areas where nonsmokers dont 
have the option of avoiding the exposure 
these findings suggest that policies regulating smoking in 
public places could have a significant impact on reducing a persons 
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke said cummings

the commerce department withdrew an export 
license for the sale of 500 million in nuclear power plant parts to 
china after the nuclear regulatory commission and sen john glenn 
protested officials said monday 
we viewed it initially as an attempt to circumvent the law 
said leonard weiss staff director of the senate committee on 
governmental affairs we discovered the state department wasnt 
even aware of this export 
glenn chairman of the committee complained in a letter to 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher that the shipment would 
undercut a 1985 congressional resolution forbidding such sales 
unless the president certified that china is not helping other 
nations build nuclear weapons 
the ohio democrat has been a frequent critic of what he calls 
chinas clandestine trade in nuclearrelated materials with third 
world countries particularly pakistan and nations in the middle 
east 
all of the equipment nonreactor items such as compressors 
pipes turbine generators and other electrical gear was from a 
canceled power plant at satsop wash the plant belongs to the 
washington public power supply system a consortium of publicly 
owned local utilities 
all of the licensing events occurred in may before the chinese 
governments crackdown on student demonstrators in beijing 
wppss spokesman gary petersen said the consortium still wants to 
sell the equipment to china 
we knew all this unrest in china would delay things petersen 
said but it doesnt stop it 
wppss also sought licenses from the nrc and the state department 
to sell the plants reactor and 250000 pounds of enriched uranium 
fuel to china 
the nrc rejected those requests earlier this year because neither 
president bush nor president reagan had certified that china is 
abiding by nuclear nonproliferation safeguards 
while the nrc is in charge of issuing export licenses for 
reactors and nuclear fuel the commerce deparment has export 
licensing authority for all nonnuclear electric power plant 
components 
however such licenses normally are not approved by either until 
after interagency consultations among the nrc the us arms control 
and disarmament agency and the state commerce and energy 
departments 
because the nonnuclear components are so coupled with the 
particular model of reactor at the wppss plant the export licenses 
for each make sense only if they are coordinated said harold 
denton director of the nrcs office of governmental and public 
affairs 
he said the commerce department license was issued in early may 
without consulting with us it was withdrawn two weeks later 
when the nrc found out about it 
it sounds to me like it was an oversight on their part because 
normally they do consult with us denton said about the commerce 
department in this case they didnt but theyve corrected 
that 
the commerce department has agreed to condition any license for 
the export of nonnuclear components to nrc approval of the reactor 
sale 
weiss said commerce deparment officials originally contended that 
a nonproliferation declaration from bush was not needed because the 
license was only for nonnuclear components however weiss said 
mosbacher later told glenn that the deal was being deferred until 
after consultations with the nrc 
a commerce official speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
the department had no basis for denying the license because the 
export was general nonnuclear industrial equipment 
the nrc and the state department both had action on this and 
none of it was going to go forward unless all three approved said 
the official and we knew it was highly unlikely that the nrc was 
going to approve it

a japanese monks account of recently sharing a room 
with american war prisoners in vietnam is being sent to washington 
for analysis us embassy spokesman karl olsson said monday 
a vietnamese embassy official called the account an absolute 
lie 
details of buddhist monk iwanobu yoshidas account were gathered 
in meetings sunday of a representative of the us defense attaches 
office in tokyo and yoshida who was freed in january after 14 years 
in a vietnamese reeducation camp olsson and yoshidas daughter 
said 
olsson said the content of the meetings was being sent to 
washington for analysis but refused to say what was discussed or 
how long the sessions ran 
yoshida is undergoing hospital treatment for mental disorders and 
a speech impediment and only his daughter keiko takatsuka can 
understand what he says a hospital spokesman said 
the us official met yoshida on sunday morning and evening at 
the hospital in sapporo on japans northernmost main island of 
hokkaido ms takatsuka said 
in the past week japanese press reports and ms takatsuka have 
said yoshida saw up to 10 americans in the vietnamese camp and 
shared a cell with three 
ms takatsuka said her father does not remember the names of 
those in his cell but described them as young and healthy 
my fathers memory is still not clear though it is improving 
as he continues to answer questions about his experiences she 
told the associated press 
the meetings sunday were kept short because of yoshidas 
condition and together lasted less than an hour she said by 
telephone from her home in sapporo 
ms takatsuka said her father reiterated in the meetings that he 
shared a room with americans in the camp and had nothing new to add 
she said a doctor and an embassy interpreter were present 
he doesnt want to meet anyone and has asked me to tell his 
story for him she said she refuses to allow reporters to meet 
yoshida 
citing his poor health ms takatsuka turned down earlier 
american requests to interview her father said a us embassy 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the story is an absolute lie said the vietnamese embassy 
official speaking on condition of anonymity there are no living 
prisoners of war in vietnam and yoshidas and his daughters 
stories just dont add up 
the united states has pressed hanoi for years for a better 
accounting of the 1730 americans still listed as missing in action 
in vietnam and 634 missing elsewhere in the war zone 
after becoming a monk in 1966 yoshida emigrated to vietnam and 
set up a temple in saigon now ho chi minh city he became a south 
vietnamese citizen in 1973 
he was arrested in 1975 after communist forces took over south 
vietnam on jan 20 vietnam released him for humanitarian reasons 
after appeals were filed by international human rights groups 
including amnesty international

the pentagon notified congress on monday that 
the bush administration has approved the sale of more powerful jet 
engines to replace the originals on f15 jet fighters flown by saudi 
arabia 
assuming there are no congressional objections the pentagon said 
the saudis would be offered the upgraded engines along with support 
equipment and spare parts at an estimated cost of 350 million 
the saudis have purchased 74 of the twinengine f15 eagles from 
the united states 
the defense department said the change would make it easier for 
the saudis to continue purchasing support services for their f15s 
since the same conversion has been made in the us air force f15 
fighters 
the sale of this equipment and support will not affect the 
basic military balance in the region the pentagon said the 
modification offers reliability and maintainability improvements 
with some increase in engine performance 
the air force will be responsible for overseeing the transaction 
and the pratt amp whitney division of the united technologies corp 
will be the prime contractor

farmers have contracted with the government to 
take an additional 246 million acres of highly erodible cropland 
from production under the 10year conservation reserve program the 
agriculture department said monday 
the additional acres were enrolled during the programs eighth 
round of signups held feb 624 the next will be july 17 through 
aug 4 
keith bjerke administrator of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service said the total contracted 
under the crp is nearly 306 million acres 
bjerke said the total now exceeds the 287 million acres that was 
in the 1960 soil bank program making the crp the largest 
longterm cropland retirement program in us history

the pentagon office that oversees star wars 
research said monday it had signed an agreement with britains 
ministry of defense to launch a joint computer project 
the work valued at an estimated 26 million over the next 4 
years will involve development and demonstration of socalled 
knowledgebased computer systems the pentagon said 
knowledgebased software programs are capable of learning and 
expanding their own capabilities as new information is added to the 
original programmed data the work with britain will focus on how 
such computer systems might help operate a defensive system against 
battlefield or naval missiles 
for example software intended to facilitate identification of 
a particular type of missile body from its rocket plume signature 
could learn to accomplish the same task for different types of 
missiles given only the new plume signature data the pentagon 
said 
the strategic defense initiative organization the pentagons 
star wars office said the british had agreed to pick up 58 percent 
of the projects cost and the united states would pick up the 
remaining 42 percent

donald gregg whose nomination as ambassador to 
south korea has been stalled by a lengthy senate probe is not the 
target of a federal perjury investigation according to the state 
departments chief legal adviser 
the official abraham d sofaer said in a letter to sen 
claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee that gregg received that assurance from the office of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh the letter was made available 
monday 
the administration has no interest is appointing as ambassadors 
individuals who are the targets of grand jury investigations 
sofaer told pell mr gregg would withdraw from consideration if 
his conduct was so regarded by a federal prosecutor this has never 
been the case however and it is not so today 
sofaer said gregg was told that he is a subject of the 
irancontra investigation being conducted by walsh but is not a 
target 
the united states attorneys manual describes a subject as a 
person whose conduct is within the scope of a grand jurys 
investigation sofaer said 
a target is described as a person to whom a prosecutor or 
the grand jury has substantial evidence linking himher to the 
commission of a crime 
under longstanding practice a target who is a witness before 
a grand jury is warned that his conduct is being investigated for 
possible violations of federal criminal law sofaer said 
when mr gregg testified before the grand jury he was informed 
that he was not a target and was not told that his conduct was 
being investigated for possible violation of federal criminal law 
he said 
the senate foreign relations committee investigation against 
gregg is focused on allegations that while serving as vice president 
bushs national security adviser in the reagan administration gregg 
helped in illegal resupply of the nicaraguan contra rebels 
sen alan cranston dcalif who has spearheaded the committees 
investigation of gregg has said he finds greggs firm denials of 
such activity hard to accept 
speculation that the grand jury might be preparing to indict 
gregg for perjury stemmed from walshs noncommittal reply when asked 
by cranston whether gregg was a target of the irancontra probe 
in that reply dated june 1 walsh said it is accurate that the 
investigation extends to perjury and false statements before the 
irancontra hearings as evidenced by the indictment of retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord 
walsh said his office had made no statement about gregg was 
unable to comment further at this time and cannot be helpful 
on the question of scheduling 
under an agreement between cranston and republican members of the 
committee gregg will be questioned under oath at a second 
investigative hearing on thursday cranston has said he will permit 
the full committee to vote on the gregg nomination on june 20

president bush won strong praise monday for his 
legislative proposal to reduce air pollution but lawmakers and 
specialinterest groups said tough bargaining remains over cutting 
motor vehicle emissions and controlling airborne toxic chemicals 
general support from industry environmental organizations and 
lawmakers on all sides of the issue centered on bushs willingness 
to put a strong proposal on the table after eight years of inaction 
by the reagan administration 
but when pressed for their detailed views these organizations 
and lawmakers differed over crucial technical points that eventually 
will decide whether a decadelong congressional logjam over clean 
air can be broken 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney said in an ottawa 
statement that he bush proposal was the most positive move by the 
united states in a decade of canadian complaints and requests for 
action 
canada which blames half its acid rain on pullution flowing in 
from the united states 
environment minister lucien bouchard said at a news conference 
i am advised the controls would satisfy canadas request for a 
50 percent reduction in acid rain reaching this country he said 
canada still hopes for a treaty to make the new controls harder to 
weaken 
the most negative comments came from coal interests 
richard l lawson president of the national coal association 
accused bush of trying to accomplish too much too soon called 
some provisions unnecessary unduly harsh and economically 
onerous and warned that electric rate payers will likely pay 
more for electricity 
sen robert c byrd dwva who represents a coalproducing 
state said bushs plan to cut acid rain unfairly penalizes the 
highsulfur coal areas abandons the promise of cleancoal 
technology and endangers the nations energy future 
the proposal by leading to massive switching from highsulfur 
to lowsulfur coal will serve as a disincentive to the use of 
cleancoal technologies byrd said 
but more typical were comments by an auto industry spokesman tim 
maccarthy who said bush has really shown leadership and rep 
henry a waxman dcalif chairman of the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee who applauded the presidents commitment 
to deal effectively with urban air pollution acid rain and air 
toxics 
this is a long journey beginning with a single step said 
rep edward r madigan of illinois ranking republican on waxmans 
subcommittee jerry jasinowski executive vice president of the 
national association of manufacturers pronounced the organization 
pleased that the president recognizes the value of allowing 
businesswide flexibility 
a crucial message of support came from house energy and commerce 
chairman john d dingell dmich known for his protection of the 
auto industrys interests on clean air 
the broad outlines appear reasonable effective and consistent 
with the need to promote economic growth and job opportunities he 
said 
demonstrating how the harmony breaks down when specifics are 
discussed waxman said bush wasnt tough enough on reduction of 
motor vehicle emissions adding without tough new controls on 
cars trucks and buses we simply wont get clean air 
maccarthy director of federal liaison of the motor vehicle 
manufacturers assocation said we dont support tailpipe emissions 
standards 
however maccarthy in a statement that could increase chances of 
eventual approval of clean air legislation said there are never 
100 percent victories in this town washington he added there 
is a very good likelihood there will be some tightening of tailpipe 
standards 
david hawkins of the natural resources defense council an 
environmental group said bush left unclear whether he would require 
use of the best possible technology to reduce the largely 
unregulated release of airborne toxic chemicals 
david gardiner of the sierra club called the air toxics part of 
the bill the weakest portion he added that the standard that 
would be imposed on industry will not make a dent in the problem 
but gardiner legislative director of the sierra club said that 
overall bush laid out a set of objectives that are worthy and 
will definitely break the logjam the reason there was no action the 
last eight years was the failure of reagan to put a proposal on the 
table 
he called bushs acid rain proposal a strong one but said hes 
skeptical about a provision to allow large utilities to trade or 
sell credits for sulfur dioxide reductions if they exceed the 
minimum reduction requirements 
in theory it should work gardiner said but added that in 
practice the trades or sales could result in an imbalance where 
there are major reductions in one region and few in another 
sen max baucus dmont chief sponsor of clean air legislation 
in the senate said the rhetoric is good but its a bit vague in 
the urban smog provisions 
he praised an attitude change in the white house because bush 
is committed to a bill which was not the case during ronald 
reagans presidency but the actual language is going to tell 
where the president is all interests are much more inclined to 
compromise baucus said 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine last years 
chief clean air legislative sponsor called bushs statement a 
significant departure from the negative environmental policy of the 
reagan administration which opposed every cleanair bill considered 
by congress for the past eight years 
he said the government must be prepared to deal fairly and 
humanely with the job loss that the proposal is likely to produce 
mitchell said he is concerned that the president did not say how 
the proposed reductions would be made adding the history of the 
clean air act demonstrates clearly that merely setting forth goals 
is not sufficient to achieve them

prime minister charles haughey seems 
destined to win a fifth term but polls indicate a parliamentary 
majority may escape him again 
haughey called thursdays election after a defeat in the dail or 
parliament where his major policies have been supported by the main 
opposition parties 
a poll published monday by the irish times showed haugheys 
fianna fail party with 47 percent support down from 50 percent in 
late may another for the sunday independent showed 45 percent 
supporting fianna fail a drop of 2 percent within a week 
margins of error were 3 percent 
the polls are giving very confused signals as i read the polls 
there is a slow strong swing toward fianna fail in the closing 
stage of this campaign haughey told a news conference monday 
in dublin betting shops however haugheys chances to return as 
taoiseach or prime minister slipped to 71 from a 101 favorite 
and the odds on fianna fail winning a majority went from 41 for to 
64 against 
a poll conducted in may for the irish times found 93 percent of 
those questioned rated unemployment a very important issue 
other rated issues were cuts in government health programs 82 
percent emigration 76 percent and poverty 70 percent 
haughey 63 called the election may 25 following his 
governments sixth defeat in the dail since it took office in march 
1987 the administration had opposed creating a 540000 fund for 
hemophiliacs who contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from 
blood transfusions 
haughey said the defeat convinced him opposition parties were 
prepared to combine against fianna fail on certain issues 
his administration had survived through the tacit support of the 
fine gael and the progressive democrats a faction that broke from 
fianna fail 
when the dail was dissolved fianna fail had 80 seats fine gael 
50 the progressive democrats 14 the labor party 11 and others 8 
two seats are vacant 
haughey needs 83 seats for a majority in the 166seat parliament 
the speaker automatically is returned and traditionally supports the 
government 
confident of winning haughey opened with a positive campaign 
emphasizing the governments record of fiscal prudence and economic 
recovery 
during his term interest rates dropped to 9 percent 5 points 
lower than in britain and inflation to a modest 35 percent the 
budget deficit was pared from 15 percent of gross national product 
in 1981 to about 5 percent 
those gains however come at the cost of continued high 
unemployment of 175 percent and emigration largely of young 
jobseekers has accelerated to 40000 a year 
haugheys cuts in public spending hit hard at fianna fails 
traditional rural and bluecollar support last week haughey 
admitted being surprised at the intensity of anger about cuts in 
public health services 
despite haugheys problems support for the combination of fine 
gael and the progressive democrats reached only 34 percent in the 
final poll of the irish times 
about 24 million people are eligible to vote and 367 candidates 
are running in 41 constituencies

france and the united states have decided to waive 
mutual visa requirements for tourists and business travelers 
starting july 1 the foreign ministry and us embassy said monday 
the united states is the last of the major countries for which 
france established visa requirements following the september 1986 
bomb wave in paris that killed 11 people french citizens have been 
required to obtain visas to enter the united states since 1945 
i hope that french tourists and businessmen will take advantage 
of the convenience of this change in our visa regulations said 
mark lissfelt charge daffaires at the us embassy the success 
of this program should lead not only to greater tourist flows 
between our two countries but also to greater understanding as 
well 
visa requirements are being waived for tourists and business 
travelers visiting france or the united states for less than three 
months 
the same arrangement for west german citizens takes effect july 
15 the us embassy in bonn said monday president bush announced 
the elimination of visa requirements during a visit to west germany 
two weeks ago 
visas still are required for french and west german students 
researchers journalists and those planning to work or remain for 
more than 90 days 
french tourism minister olivier stirn said lifting visa 
requirements has a symbolic value 
it translates into the excellence of relations between france 
and the united states and should help the return of american 
clientele to france the imposition of visa requirements had 
proved a serious brake on tourism he said 
fewer than 1 million us tourists visited france in 1986 
according to the tourism ministry more than 24 million are 
expected this year as france celebrates the bicentennial of its 
revolution 
france imposed visa requirements in october 1986 exempting only 
member nations of the european economic community switzerland and 
lichtenstein

a former policeman received two life 
prison sentences monday for fatally shooting his estranged wife in 
her judicial chambers and firing at three fellow officers 
clarence ratliff 53 showed no emotion when circuit judge dennis 
kolenda announced his punishment for the oct 19 violence at the 
kent county hall of justice here that claimed the life of district 
judge carol s irons 40 
kolenda told ratliff his punishment must show that no one is 
above the law 
outside the courtroom irons friends and relatives hugged 
kolendas office was flooded with thousands of letters requesting 
ratliff receive the harshest penalty allowable after a jury may 11 
convicted the former officer of the lesser charge of voluntary 
manslaughter 
ratliff a 21year veteran of the city police department had 
been charged with firstdegree murder 
kolenda said he stepped outside sentencing guidelines because of 
the crimes seriousness its location public sentiment and 
ratliffs position of trust in the community ratliff was off duty 
at the time of the shootings 
the former officer received the life sentences for his conviction 
on two counts of assault with intent to murder for shooting at two 
officers who came to irons aid neither officer was wounded 
ratliff got 10 to 15 years for the manslaughter conviction as 
well as a term of two years and eight months to four years for 
assault with a firearm for shooting at a third officer 
all the penalties were concurrent except for a twoyear sentence 
for using a firearm during commission of a felony as a result 
ratliff will be eligible for parole in 10 years 
before sentencing kolenda allowed irons friends family and 
coworkers to address the court 
many said ratliff should receive the maximum penalty because 
ratliff never showed remorse for the killing although he apologized 
to fellow officers moments after shooting at them 
ratliff who declined to address the court contended that he did 
not intend to kill irons but was drunk and angry about a property 
dispute in their divorce proceedings 
he shot irons in the throat in her chambers then followed as she 
fled into a hallway firing another shot 
the jury found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter but we 
know that mr ratliff leveled his gun at her and watched for what 
must surely have seemed an eternity before stealing her life away in 
the blink of an eye her parents james and virginia irons said 
through their daughters attorney and friend diann landers 
i think our message was heard said attorney sara smolenski 
a friend of the late judge who helped organize the carol s irons 
committee for justice which staged rallies protesting the ratliff 
verdict and domestic violence 
defense attorney grant gruel said a decision on an appeal has not 
been made

egypt sought an expanded peacemaking role monday 
by offering its services as an active postman between israel and 
the palestine liberation organization 
in cairo president hosni mubarak met with plo chief yasser 
arafat who indicated hope remained for israels plan to start peace 
negotiations with elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
we have not rejected the idea of elections but we have specific 
questions on the subject arafat said can there be democracy 
without freedom can there be democracy without selfdetermination 
mubarak told journalists in cairo there is a new seriousness 
in the us position on the palestinian issue that could point 
toward a settlement 
foreign minister moshe arens rejected the offer by egypt with 
which israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 to be middleman for 
indirect negotiations he said israel does not want to enhance the 
status of the plo which it still considers a terrorist organization 
there is no room for mediation arens said after a 90minute 
meeting with butros ghali mubaraks minister of state for foreign 
affairs the most senior egyptian official to visit israel since a 
palestinian uprising began 18 months ago in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
arens expressed optimism about the prospects for israels peace 
plan even though both palestinians and rightwing israelis have 
criticized it 
he said ghali gave the plan a sympathetic hearing and noted 
that 94 of the 100 us senators endorsed it last week 
prime minister yitzhak shamir proposes elections in which 
palestinians would choose representatives to negotiate with israel 
on an interim autonomy plan to last five years the final status of 
the occupied territories then would be discussed 
the plan has some positive and some negative elements and 
these negative elements must be corrected if we wish to obtain the 
support or participation by the palestinians in this plan ghali 
said before returning to cairo from a twoday visit 
palestinians insist on withdrawal of israeli soldiers from the 
occupied lands or at least from population centers and on 
international supervision of the elections they also seek 
assurances their demands for an independent state would be realized 
mansour shawa a gaza strip businessman said the israeli plan 
does not meet the minimum aspirations of the palestinian people 
he praised as wellbalanced a new peace program advanced by 
asad siftawi a prominent plo supporter from gaza who recently 
served a sixmonth prison term without trial 
under siftawis plan palestinians would take part in elections 
without an israeli withdrawal and would accept a stagebystage 
solution provided that its ultimate goal of statehood be determined 
beforehand 
shawa said of the plan these are really minimum requirements 
that would be acceptable to the palestinians 
shawa spoke after a breakfast meeting between ghali and 30 
prominent palestinians in herzliya a tel aviv suburb he quoted 
ghali as saying he was ready to serve as a link between palestinians 
in the occupied territories and the plo as well as between israel 
and the plo 
i am ready to be a good and active postman participants 
quoted ghali as saying 
several palestinians boycotted the meeting with ghali including 
some prominent supporters of the plo some felt the meeting should 
have been held in arab east jerusalem and others said they were 
threatened by plo militants 
saeed kanaan a west bank businessman who did not attend quoted 
a caller representing plo faction based in syria as saying anyone 
who meets with him will be killed it is very easy to get to 
you 
ghali advised the palestinians not be affected by hardline 
rhetoric by israel noting that hawks like former prime minister 
menachem begin took seemingly unchangeable positions during 
negotiations that led to the peace treaty between egypt and israel 
israel radio quoted shamir as telling an audience of farmers the 
government would halt talks with the palestinians if their 
negotiators insisted on an independent state rather than limited 
autonomy for the 17 million palestinians in the occupied 
territories

president bush declaring too many americans 
breathe dirty air unveiled an ambitious plan monday to purge 
urban smog from most cities by the year 2000 and to sharply reduce 
acidrain pollution 
environmentalists praised his effort but said he should go 
further the coal industry said he was trying too much too soon 
to curb smogproducing ozone bush recommended that automakers be 
required to build and sell methanolpowered cars in nine urban areas 
plagued by dirty air and he recommended that limits on tailpipe 
emissions of ozoneproducing hydrocarbons in existing cars be 
tightened by almost 40 percent 
bush also proposed a 10million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide 
emissions from coalburning power plants a major cause of acid 
rain if achieved that would be a 50 percent cut 
moreover he said industry should be required to use new 
technology to curb the release of cancercausing toxic chemicals 
into the air 
bush outlined his legislative package at the white house in a 
speech to members of congress governors and industry and 
environmental groups 
later keeping the focus on the environment he flew to 
yellowstone national park in wyoming for a firsthand look at damage 
from the fires that blackened nearly half of the parks 22 million 
acres last year on tuesday he will make environmental speeches 
near jackson hole wyo and in lincoln neb 
energy secretary james d watkins said cleaning the air will 
neither be free nor easy 
the white house said the post1995 cost of the acid rain program 
would be about 38 billion a year or a bit more than 2 percent of 
the nations current electric bills 
to customers of the affected plants rate increase could be 
greater on board air force one white houes chief of staff john 
sununu said ratepayers in the affected states could expect increases 
of 5 percent to 10 percent 
ohio gov richard celeste told a news conference in columbus 
ratepayers in his state faced doubledigit increases 
at a briefing before bushs speech william reilly head of the 
environmental protection agency estimated the overall program would 
cost between 14 billion and 19 billion a year after it is in full 
effect at the turn of the century 
richard ayres chairman of the national clean air coalition said 
bushs plan had strong provisions for dealing with acid rain 
however in the area of urban smog he said he was concerned that 
not enough was being proposed to deal with pollution from existing 
gasolinepowered cars 
our concern is that he places a lot of reliance on new kinds of 
fuel ayres said i think he got an a for effort hes heading 
in the right direction 
in canada which blames half its acid rain on pullution flowing 
in from the united states environment minister lucien bouchard said 
at a news conference i am advised the controls would satisfy 
canadas request for a 50 percent reduction in acid rain reaching 
this country he said canada still hopes for a treaty to make the 
new controls harder to weaken 
prime minister brian mulroney said the bush proposal was the most 
positive move by the united states in a decade of canadian 
complaints and requests for action 
brooks b yeager an audubon society official said we may 
quarrel with some of the details but its certainly a major step 
forward yeager and other environmentalists said bush was not 
going far enough to control toxic poisons and other pollutants that 
are severe public health threats 
on the other hand the president of the national coal 
association richard l lawson said bush was seeking to 
accomplish too much too soon 
unfortunately some of the provisions unveiled today are 
unnecessary unduly harsh and economically onerous he said in a 
statement if enacted they threaten to smother the economy and 
stifle american competitiveness 
in his speech bush said the nation has made progress toward 
clean air over the past 10 years but we have not come far enough 
too many americans continue to breathe dirty air and political 
paralysis has plagued further progress against air pollution he 
said 
bush said weve seen enough of this stalemate its time to 
clear the air 
republican gov thomas kean of new jersey who has waged a dogged 
campaign to clean up the environment in his state said this is 
much further than i honestly expected the president to go 
bushs predecessor ronald reagan did not try to tighten clean 
air laws the last overhaul of the landmark 1970 clean air act was 
in 1977 
bush said that dozens of cities currently do not meet federal 
airquality standards 
reilly head of the environmental protection agency said the 
proposal is going to solve that problem by the year 2000 for all 
but two or three cities and bush said that within 20 years by 
the year 2010 even los angeles houston and new york will be 
expected to make it 
bush urged congress to require automakers to phase in production 
of cars that use alternate fuels such as methanol by 1995 the 
automakers would be required to sell 500000 such cars in areas with 
the worst smog by 1997 the required number of cars would be 1 
million 
that effort would focus on nine urban areas new york los 
angeles houston milwaukee baltimore philadelphia san diego 
chicago and metropolitan areas of connecticut 
unlike gasoline methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes the 
severe smog problems that have made the air unhealthful in many 
metropolitan areas 
in an attempt to curb the release of toxic chemicals from 
industrial plants bush proposed requiring industry to use the best 
available technology to curb such pollution the plan anticipates 
near term reductions in airborne toxic chemicals including many 
that are cancer causing of between 75 and 90 percent 
the proposal to combat acid rain calls for half of the 
10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide to be achieved by 1995 
the proposal would allow utilities that exceed the required 
reductions to accumulate credits that would be sold or traded to 
other utilities that are unable to reach the reduction targets 
about 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide gas are released annually 
into the air most from power plants that burn highsulfur coal the 
gas turns into sulfates combines with moisture and falls in rain or 
snow often hundreds of miles away 
scientists have blamed acid rain for causing substantial damage 
to lakes forests and aquatic life especially in the northeast and 
canada as a result of pollutants released from power plants in the 
ohio valley and industrial midwest

a wouldbe model died of an apparent 
overdose of anesthetic during breast enlargement surgery the 
medical examiner says 
angela umeda a mother of two died minutes after she was 
injected numerous times with the local anesthetic lidocaine june 1 
an autopsy report sunday said the report ruled the death accidental 
no one ever dreamed that this healthy 23yearold would go in 
for this seemingly simple procedure and come out dead said dewey 
h varner a lawyer for umedas mother umeda planned to marry on 
july 2 varner said 
umeda a petite size 3 at 105 pounds wanted to become a model 
and went to dr carl fosdick for the 2000 operation that he began 
in his office varner said 
she heard that she could do a little better in the modeling 
field with larger breasts varner said 
umeda died of lidocaine intoxication wrote dr john marraccini 
palm beach countys chief deputy medical examiner 
tests found she had 147 milligrams of lidocaine per liter of 
blood lidocaine is known to cause toxic reactions at half this 
level marraccini said in a statement 
the levels and circumstances at the scene seem to indicate an 
excessive quantity of lidocaine was used he said in an interview 
sunday 
fosdick didnt have office hours monday and couldnt be reached 
by telephon his attorney earl l denney jr said 
all i can say is the whole situation is a terrible tragedy for 
dr fosdick and a terrible tragedy for the family of angela umeda 
and angela umeda 
marraccini said in the interview that umeda appeared to be 
healthy before the operation and had successfully undergone 
anesthesia twice during childbirth 
dr alan serure a boardcertified plastic surgeon in miami said 
such deaths are very infrequent 
the nearly twohour operation in which a gel implant is placed 
beneath the breast or chest muscle can be performed in an office or 
hospital serure said 
it is not a particularly risky procedure it is an everyday 
procedure he said

the noonhour temperature was 77 the humidity was 60 percent and 
bushs tshirt was soaked with presidential sweat by time he 
finished his run at fort mcnair an army post in southwest 
washington 
i wanted to show that 65 can still do three miles bush 
puffed

bush departed by helicopter for andrews air force base md on the 
first leg of a trip to the west the president planned to inspect 
regrowth at firedamaged yellowstone national park and visit grand 
teton national park 
the gorilla wore a red sash that read kinder gentler and 
carried gasfilled balloons marked education sampl and 
clean air first lady barbara bush laughed and waved from the 
balcony 
when he was sworn in at age 64 in january bush was the fourth 
oldest man ever inaugurated white house physician burton lee says 
bush is in excellent shape and consequently 10 years younger than 
his stated age 
after bushs midday jog he reached into his limousine for a 
plastic bag containing ice and cans of orange soda tossed a soda to 
an aide and had one himself 
accompanying the president on the run were a military police 
cruiser and a few secret service agents in jogging gear carrying 
walkietalkies at the end a handful of other joggers were tailing 
along too

president 
joe jr had run once before with bush his mother joann 
bagnerise said she had worried that time about her sons ability to 
keep up with bush because the young man suffers from asthma i was 
afraid that he was going to embarrass himself but he did all 
right she said 
she carried a hastily made sign that said happy birthday mr 
president with love and some snapshots she had taken of bushs 
first run with her son she took more snapshots monday until her 
camera ran out of film 
joe lifts weights and has such muscular arms that reporters on 
the sidelines overheard bush say as they ran by that he looked 
like an lsu halfback 
turning to a reporter bush called out as he ran by it 
wouldnt hurt you to do a little running yourself 
on his way to yellowstone national park to inspect last summers 
fire damage bush invited reporters aboard air force one into his 
compartment for a celebration cutting a chocolate cake himself 
while aides passed out champagne 
the president in a jovial mood brandished a newspaper article 
on the advantages senior citizens get such as discounts on mass 
transit fares 
barbara bush who turned 64 on thursday violated an agreement 
not to exchange gifts this year and give him two pairs of tennis 
shorts the president said 
on arrival at west yellowstone montana bush was serenaded with 
happy birthday by about 700 wellwishers at the airport

two college dropouts with links to drug 
dealers and with an obsession for archaeology pulled off the robbery 
of 124 priceless artifacts from the national museum of anthropology 
in 1985 officials said monday 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo said the pair 
visited the museum more than 50 times made sketches and plans then 
jumped the fence crawled in through an airconditioning duct and 
looted seven display cases before dawn on christmas day 1985 
federal police recovered 111 of the artifacts and arrested one of 
the purported thieves and six associates friday 
officials said investigators were stumped for more than three 
years because they thought professionals were responsible 
it turned out they were amateurs two university dropouts who 
became obsessed first with having and later with selling the 
archaeological artifacts a source at the attorney generals 
office said on condition of anonymity 
suspects include an american man and an argentine woman alvarez 
told a news conference where the artifacts were exhibited on a long 
table covered with green felt 
fortunately the most significant pieces were recovered as you 
can see for yourselves we can place no value on them they are 
priceless said roberto garcia moll director of the national 
institute for history and anthropology which supervises the museum 
one major piece a zapotec mask of the bat god murcielago from 
the monte alban ruins in southern mexico had come apart and had to 
be repaired he said 
alvarez said carlos perches trevino 24 and ramon sardina garcia 
carefully staked out the museum on christmas day they jumped the 
fence of the poorly guarded building in mexico citys chapultepec 
park and crawled through an airconditioning duct into the maya 
room he said 
according to alvarez the pair filled a canvas bag with 124 jade 
gold and stone artifacts and drove off in a car they left parked 
outside 
he said they hid the treasure for more than an year then took it 
to acapulco the resort on the pacific coast where they met drug 
traffickers and tried to interest one identified as salvador 
gutierrez in buying the artifacts 
perches and sardina traded gutierrez several artifacts for an 
unspecified amount of cocaine but never made a deal for the entire 
cache alvarez said 
he said the sum of 1 billion was apparently mentioned but no 
deal materialized 
gutierrez was arrested on trafficking charges this year in 
reynosa across the border from mcallen texas and mentioned the 
artifacts while under police questioning alvarez said 
federal agents tailed perches who had returned to mexico city 
with the artifacts for 45 days before the arrests last friday 
alvarez said investigators initially thought 140 pieces were 
stolen but later determined the number to be 124 
the artifacts are to be returned to the museum wednesday at a 
ceremony attended by president carlos salinas de gortari 
alvarez said perches is being charged with theft and damage to 
national treasures charges that could mean 10 years in prison upon 
conviction and an arrest warrant was issued for sardina 
cocaine trafficking and possession charges were filed against 
perches his brother luis a us citizen named gary nathan chafee 
and an exotic dancer and restaurant owner named isabel camila 
maciero who performed under the name of the princess yamal those 
charges carry a penalty of up to 25 years 
chafee and two friends of perches juan castillo carriles and 
hugo ricardo perez radilla are being charged with coverup 
alvarez said an argentine woman identified as cristina gloria 
gonzalez was marginally involved and would be deported 
a us embassy source who insisted on anonymity described 
chafee only as a longtime resident of mexico city

mayor edward i koch and the eight men seeking to 
unseat him signed a pledge monday to avoid any appeals to prejudice 
or bigotry during their campaigns 
but the candidates meeting en masse for the first time made 
clear that the deal did not preclude oldfashioned sharptongued 
political rhetoric 
this is not a campaign for president of the high school koch 
reminded the group this is a campaign for mayor and i assume we 
are going to be critical of one another 
koch and some of his opponents already have swapped attacks 
republican rudolph w giuliani wished out loud for a broader 
truce one barring all groundless and false charges among the 
candidates 
no one took him up on it and giuliani a former federal 
prosecutor went on to defend a particularly pointed attack on one 
of his opponents cosmetics heir ronald lauder by one of his 
allies local liberal party leader raymond harding 
harding last week called lauder a man whose family business 
would sell israel out for a few riyals from saudi arabia he based 
that on a comment by lauders mother estee lauder that she 
preferred not to sell in israel 
fair comment on an issue that had been raised by someone 
else said giuliani 
but mostly the candidates kept their comments goodnatured 
when richard ravitch came in late he took fellow democrat 
harrison j goldins seat while goldin spoke at the podium 
thats not the seat i want anyway goldin joked 
then republican and righttolife party candidate henry hewes 
took a seat vacated by koch and the mayor told hewes thats 
probably the only time youll have it 
thats a cheap shot protested hewes i think ill file a 
complaint 
the candidates were convened by the committee on decent unbiased 
campaign tactics conduct which said it would investigate 
complaints of appeals to bigotry if a transgression were confirmed 
the candidate would be asked to repudiate it 
we dont seek to keep passion or pride out of these 
campaigns said conducts leader r peter straus we embrace 
pride and passion but we reject we will not tolerate prejudice 
or bigotry in this campaign 
critics accused koch of racial insensitivity during the 
presidential campaign last year when he said jews have got to be 
crazy to vote for jesse jackson because of jacksons position on 
israel

vice president dan quayle sought 
help monday from latin american allies in pressuring gen manuel 
antonio noriega out of power in panama and warned of the possibility 
of an antidemocratic alliance among cuba nicaragua and panama 
on the first full day of a threeday tour of central america 
quayle met with the presidents of honduras and guatemala and said he 
discussed with them possible future measures against noriega if an 
organization of american states initiative now under way fails to 
remove him from power 
if in fact he doesnt leave we will have to pursue other 
options said quayle without being specific quayle said the 
options could include political and economic concerns panama has 
with other countries 
quayle made those comments to reporters before traveling from 
guatemala to honduras he met with guatemalan president vinicia 
cerezo in guatemala city and honduran president jose azcona hoya in 
tegucigalpa later quayle met with two candidates in that countrys 
november presidential election 
the vice president at all times protected by a large security 
detail also had lunch with us troops at an air force base outside 
the honduran capital 
the united states already has in place economic and trade 
sanctions against panama president bush recently strengthened the 
us troop presence there 
quayle would not discuss the new oas initiative other than to 
say the united states supports it 
but an official traveling with the vice president said in general 
terms that the oas plan would provide for deposing noriega and for a 
national dialogue leading to the installation of a democratically 
elected government 
that official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
quayle was interested in the oas proposal but was insistent that 
noreiga must step down before such a dialogue is begun 
quayle referring to recent reports that nicaragua was planning 
to send arms to panama to help forces loyal to noriega in the event 
of a us attack said he was concerned about a possible 
antidemocratic axis involving panama cuba and nicaragua a 
development he said would destabilize central america 
quayle said the leaders with whom he met were united in their 
opposition to noriegas staying in power 
cerezo however said that while he supports democracy in panama 
its autonomy must also be respected 
it is important to not confuse bilateral relations between 
the united states and panama with the concerns of the 
hemisphere cerezo told reporters at the national palace 
us officials traveling with quayle said cerezo adopted a 
harsher stance toward noriega in the private meeting with the vice 
president 
azcona told reporters that his position regarding noriega 
coincided with that of the united states 
latin nations have not shown much enthusiasm for interfering in 
panama beyond verbal condemnations of noriega for invalidating the 
results of the may 7 election which independent observers said was 
overwhlemingly won by his opposition 
at one point while in guatemala quayle stopped his motorcade on 
a busy downtown street drawing crowds of onlookers he entered an 
openfront store and purchased a soccer ball for his children 
tossing it with some bystanders before moving on

the federal government monday allowed 
broomfield to resume digging a ditch around its reservoir to divert 
a stream allegedly contaminated by hazardous wastes from the rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant 
the size of the stream and of the impacted area is not that 
significant said max dodson director of water management for the 
environmental protection agencys denver office he said the epa 
would not require broomfield to obtain a permit for the project 
im elated city manager george diciero said after learning 
of epas decision we will resume digging tomorrow 
the army corps of engineers will issue a letter of confirmation 
allowing broomfield to proceed 
diciero said the city of 27600 began digging a diversion ditch 
and building an earthen dam to divert walnut creek following us 
justice department allegations that rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant dumped hazardous chemicals into the creek 
walnut creek flows out of rocky flats into great western 
reservoir which supplies half of broomfields drinking water the 
creek provides about 5 percent of the towns total water needs 
the debate over the diversion canal was the latest development 
involving federal and state investigations of illegal dumping and 
burning at rocky flats located 16 miles northwest of denver last 
tuesday 75 fbi agents and epa investigators raided the plant the 
department of energy facility operated by contractor rockwell 
international makes plutonium detonators for nuclear bombs 
initially the government said broomfield needed a permit from 
the epa and army corps of engineers to divert walnut creek and work 
on the ditch was stopped monday pending the outcome of discussions 
city officials met for much of the day with federal officials at 
the epa office in denver and then toured the ditch and dam site 
after the onsite inspection dodson announced his decision 
the flow in the river is an absolute trickle dodson said 
adding that the affected area was less than one acre i respect 
broomfields effort to develop a safety margin here 
the epa decision was based on broomfields project falling into a 
category of water diversion that only requires a letter of 
confirmation from the army corps of engineers dodson said 
the diversion project is expected to cost about 50000 
diciero said broomfield requested permission to divert the creek 
two or three months ago but got no response from the epa until 
digging began saturday 
broomfield officials said they wrote rocky flats operators last 
week requesting no more water from the plant be discharged into the 
creek 
a spokesman for plant operator rockwell international said 
officials would consider the request 
gov roy romer meanwhile in washington dc monday to meet 
with the head of the department of energy said doe chief adm james 
d watkins pledged to immediately address the need for better 
monitoring of hazardous wastes coming from rocky flats 
the government charged in an affidavit made public last week that 
rocky flats illegally dumped hazardous chemicals into the creek on 
nov 1516 1988 and also that hazardous wastes were illegally 
burned at the plant 
federal officials said then they didnt believe there was any 
health hazard and the state health department monday said samples 
taken over the weekend of drinking water in broomfield and other 
communities were not contaminated by any of 59 organic substances 
typically analyzed in checking drinking water 
however the state still was testing for 13 other chemicals 
specifically cited by federal investigators in their probe of rocky 
flats results were expected later in the week department assistant 
director tom looby said 
we are confident that these initial tests indicate that the 
likelihood of any of the 13 chemicals being found in these drinking 
water supplies is very very small looby said

the council of state ruled monday that the 
33 top communist party and government officials who lost in the june 
4 elections even though they ran unopposed cannot be candidates in 
runoff elections 
only two candidates of the 35 on the national list received a 
majority of votes in the elections and will take their seats in the 
460seat sejm lower house of parliament 
the other 33 including prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski 
failed to get the required 50 percent of the vote and the council of 
state said they could not be candidates in the runoff elections this 
sunday 
it said that instead competitive elections for the 33 vacant 
seats will be held with two candidates running for each seat 
solidarity and other opposition groups will not be able to enter 
candidates for those seats however 
the council said 66 new candidates will be selected by the 
communist party and its allies the peasants and democratic parties 
and several small progovernment roman catholic groups 
after the ruling rakowski announced he would not seek a seat in 
the new parliament but he did not rule out continuing to lead the 
government 
others on the national list who lost when they failed to get 
a majority in the june 4 balloting include interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak and six other members of the communist party 
politburo 
also monday a judge registered a journalists union banned in 
1982 continuing the process of restoring legal status to 
independent groups affiliated with the solidarity union movement 
we dont treat this day as a victory merely a return to 
normality said stefan bratkowski president of the association of 
polish journalists 
the association had been replaced by a union of journalists that 
was approved by the government after the 1981 martial law crackdown 
during the martiallaw period solidarity was outlawed and the 
government purged 500 to 1000 journalists from offical publications 
for their political views 
solidarity was legalized again following an agreement with the 
government in april that also prepared the way for the elections 
rakowski announced he would not run for the sejm in a statement 
to the states pap news agency he said he wanted to ensure the 
will of the electorate would not be offended 
but he left open the possibility of continuing as prime minister 
a post he assumed in september polish law does not require the 
prime minister to be a member of parliament 
i am not withdrawing from public life rakowski said 
just the opposite with all my might i will serve my nation in 
any posts my party and constitutional authorities of the state 
entrust to me and which i consider possible to accept 
the june 4 elections were the freest in poland in more than four 
decades and solidaritysupported candidates won 160 of the 161 seats 
open to the opposition in the 460seat sejm opposition candidates 
could run for all 100 seat in the new senate and they won 92 
in addition to the 33 national list vacancies sundays 
runoff elections are to decide 262 contested sejm seats and eight 
senate seats for which no candidate got 50 percent of votes 
the decision not to allow any of the defeated national list 
candidates to run again appeared aimed at heading off voters 
claiming their june 4 decision was thwarted 
after the elections the sejm and senate elect a president 
presumably communist party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski by virtue 
of the partys builtin majority in the sejm 
the new president names a prime minister to form a new government

parliament once described by a member as the 
longestrunning farce in the west end has been added to britains 
fall television schedule 
the mother of parliaments voted monday to admit television 
cameras but adopted rules ensuring the electronic eye will be too 
polite to notice rude behavior 
if someone behaves in a disorderly silly or boorish manner 
why should this be kept from the people who elected them asked 
labor party legislator frank dobson 
that happens especially at question time when prime minister 
margaret thatcher and her ministers face hostile questions from the 
opposition alternated with softballs tossed by mrs thatchers 
conservative backbenchers 
in the sport of parliamentary discourse such exchanges are 
shouted above a din of wisecracks jeering or a drone of hear 
hear 
speaker of the house bernard weatherill has to bellow order 
order when the right honorable members are particularly frisky 
in the event of an occasion of grave disorder television 
cameras will be obliged to zero in on weatherill not the ruckus in 
the benches 
if the speaker is receiving advice from a lowly clerk the rules 
adopted monday require the camera turn away 
otherwise the lens may gaze at the head and shoulders of the 
legislator speaking although a reaction shot is permitted if 
another member is mentioned by name 
john wakeham leader of the house of commons and chairman of the 
select committee on televising its proceedings said the rules will 
produce an electronic hansard a video equivalent of the 
official printed record 
the 9month experiment begins in november when queen elizabeth ii 
presides at the state opening of parliament the following july the 
house will debate whether to permit permanent coverage 
the british broadcasting corp and independent television news 
have protested the restrictions 
the range of camera shots being proposed is so restricted 
especially during questions and statements and during what the 
report describes as periods of disorder that what the viewers will 
be seeing may well be less than full balanced fair and accurate 
said itn associate editor glyn mathias 
there will be a burden on the commentator to explain to viewers 
what they cannot see for themselves he added 
an amendment to permit unrestricted coverage was defeated on a 
vote of 27498 
matthew parris author of the commons sketch in the times of 
london ridiculed the rules last month 
readers at any given moment the least interesting thing in 
the chamber is the member speaking he wrote 
nick budgen interrupting ted heath snoozing frank haynes 
snarling simon hughes bleating dame elaine kellettbowman 
screeching roy hattersley digesting these are the stuff of which 
parliament is made 
the house of lords has permitted television coverage of its 
debates for 4 years and viewers occasionally may glimpse a peer of 
the realm sleeping soundly 
television newscasts now use tape recordings of statements in 
parliament along with a still photograph of the speaker

the international monetary fund may approve 
this month a 46 billion loan to venezuela officials said monday 
a move which would complete a process begun in february after riots 
in venezuela linked to government austerity measures 
the riots in which the government said 246 people were killed 
were triggered by increases in bus fares and gasoline prices as part 
of a program to satisfy the imf and other creditors 
the day after the violence broke out in caracas veneuzuelan 
officials reached a tentative accord with the fund 
the officials who declined to be quoted by name said monday imf 
staff has completed work on the loan it now has to be presented to 
the funds board of executive directors who represent the 151 
member governments the united states has about 19 percent of the 
voting power 
part of the new loan could go to reduce venezuelas existing debt 
of more than 35 billion private bankers to whom almost all the 
money is owed would be urged to reduce old debt in return for imf 
assurances that interest would be promptly paid on the remaining 
debt

tax breaks and other incentives than through regulations a group of 
senators told environmental protection agency administrator william 
k reilly monday 
reilly and new jersey gov thomas kean chairman of the national 
wetlands policy forum met with nine senators to discuss strategies 
for stemming the loss of americas shrinking wetlands 
the administration previously thought it would confine itself 
to executive orders said sen john h chafee rri you do 
better with incentives he said after the meeting 
you get a lot more with a carrot than a stick kean said of 
the incentive approach that might be offered to farmers developers 
and private landowners to encourage actions that would help protect 
if not increase swamps estuaries and other watersoaked land that 
protects wildlife cleans waterways and helps regulate streamflow 
more than 50 percent of tidal wetlands in the lower 48 states is 
in private hands senators conveyed their concern that federal 
wetlands policy be fair to landowners kean said 
a lot of senators wanted to make sure this wasnt a 
confiscatory policy kean said we want to make sure for those 
areas where wetlands are acquired they receive full compensation 
he said 
senators such as james a mcclure ridaho said environmental 
policymakers might work from the example of historic preservation 
programs which have been based upon tax breaks for those who 
rehabilitate buildings to strict federal standards chafee said 
the 20member national wetland policy forum made up of state and 
local officials farmers businessmen developers and academic 
experts returned a set of more than 100 recommendations last fall 
aimed at achieving no net loss of wetlands president bush 
endorsed such a goal in the campaign 
no one is certain but there have been estimates that up to 
400000 acres of wetlands have been lost to development annually in 
recent years 
the forum was convened with the help of the conservation

a man castrated by two masked men before he was 
convicted of raping a teenage girl has evidence for a new trial 
his attorney told a federal appeals court monday 
the case against wayne dumond of forrest city ark was an 
absolute failure of justice attorney john wesley hall told a 
threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
dumond convicted in 1985 of raping and kidnapping the forrest 
city teen is serving a prison sentence of life plus 20 years 
hall said dumond deserved an opportunity to question the girl 
regarding new genetic evidence the attorney said proved his client 
could not have committed the rape 
last january us magistrate h david young in little rock ark 
denied dumonds request for a new trial and motions to subpoena the 
victim and her father 
young said the victims identification of dumond was strong and 
that the newly discovered evidence of an inconclusive scientific 
test would not likely produce a verdict of acquittal upon retrial 
hall contended monday that it was necessary to question the 
victim in connection with new genetic evidence derived from semen 
found on her pant leg 
hall said the genetic test proved dumond could not have committed 
the rape and that the procedure was more than 99 percent accurate 
the attorney also claimed the victims initial identification of 
dumond was shaky and that she was coached by her father in picking 
dumond out of a lineup 
assistant attorney general theodore holder said he had moved to 
quash the subpoenas so the victim would not be put through further 
painful testimony 
holder said her testimony would not have changed 
her identification was solid he said she never varied 
while dumond was awaiting trial two masked men broke into his 
home and bound and castrated him no arrests have been made in that 
case 
in a brief hall filed earlier this year with the federal appeals 
court dumond identified the girls father as one of the men 
involved in the attack at his home 
the brief said that after the castration thenst francis county 
sheriff coolidge conlee time had dumonds testicles preserved in 
formaldehyde and displayed them for about two weeks on his desk 
dumond subsequently won a lawsuit against conlee and the case 
was settled for 110000 hall said

china ordered a nationwide alert tuesday for 
dissident fang lizhi telling local authorities to arrest him at 
once if he is seen trying to escape the country 
the government on monday gave security forces permission to shoot 
people who incite unrest and outlawed all independent student and 
worker groups 
fang and his wife li shuxian have been sequestered in the us 
embassy in beijing since a military crackdown on prodemocracy 
protests on june 3 they are accused by the government of 
committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda and 
instigation 
beijings public security bureau issued orders tesday that 
other provinces other cities all airports and all guards on the 
border should carry out the arrest warrant against fang and his 
wife the order was read over beijing radio 
the government has strongly protested to the united states for 
giving shelter to fang calling it interference in chinas internal 
affairs 
in washington the state department said chinese security forces 
surrounded the embassy in an obvious effort to keep other dissidents 
from taking refuge there 
chinese television broadcast photographs of fang and his wife 
monday night 
dont let these people flee the announcer said they are 
wanted for counterrevolutionary crimes 
fang a renowned astrophysicist played no active role in recent 
studentled demonstrations for democratic reforms however he has 
been an outspoken critic of the communist party saying the marxist 
system has failed here and economic reform will not work unless 
accompanied by sweeping political reform 
us secretary of state james baker and other department 
officials met with chinas ambassador in washington han xu over 
the weekend to discuss the fang case the bush administration 
indicated earlier it would not let the chinese arrest the fangs 
the us embassy compound is regarded as american soil under 
international law and chinese authorities cannot enter without the 
embassys permission 
the attacks on fang are part of a nationwide propaganda campaign 
to discredit the prodemocracy movement and justify the harsh 
military crackdown in beijing that killed or injured thousands of 
people including many students 
the government on monday told police and soldiers nationwide they 
had the right to shoot rioters and counterrevolutionaries at 
the same time it banned independent student and worker associations 
security forces made hundreds of further arrests including 
several leaders of independent labor unions bringing the number of 
announced arrests to more than 1000 across china 
all developments pointed to a strengthening of the governments 
effort to suppress the movement for a freer society and an end to 
official corruption 
the crackdown began june 3 when thousands of soldiers from the 
peoples liberation army entered beijing and marched on tiananmen 
square which was occupied by thousands of students 
chinas government says nearly 300 people were killed mostly 
soldiers however chinese witnesses and western intelligence said 
the toll could be as high as 3000 most of them civilians 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler challenged chinese 
government assertions that troops did not fire on students massed in 
tiananmen the whole world has seen what happened she said 
monday 
ms tutwiler said if deng xiaoping chinas senior leader was 
responsible for the brutal attack on tiananmen square then he has 
acted to undercut the very reform process he has sought to foster 
in ottawa external affairs minister joe clark said canadas 
ambassador in beijing is being recalled temporarily to protest the 
killings 
the widening crackdown was further evidence that hardliners led 
by deng have gained control of the government after a power struggle 
with leaders more sympathetic to student demands 
one western diplomat described the present situation in beijing 
as a cold terror aimed at cowing the population 
several of us have seen arrests made at gunpoint and police 
beating people in the streets he said monday speaking on 
condition of anonymity from what weve seen in the last few days 
we cant seriously expect the police or troops to be fussy about who 
they shoot 
chinese media said life in beijing had returned to normal and bus 
lines were running and banks were open 
but posters began appearing asking for information about 
relatives who disappeared in the violent suppression 
fear has spread through the capital chinese have begun refusing 
to see foreign reporters and report that among their work units 
movement has begun to ferret out prodemocracy supporters 
in a statement foreshadowing a possible purge in the ruling 
communist party beijing vicemayor huang chao called on every party 
organization to look at the movement as a severe test for every 
communist party member 
the ministry of public security said police and soldiers should 
use their weapons against rioters and counterrevolutionaries to 
curb criminal activity defined as disrupting social order and 
riots 
it marked the first time the government acknowledged that police 
and soldiers nationwide have been given the right to fire on 
protesters 
staterun radio and tv said hundreds of arrests were made monday 
in the provincial capitals of hangzhou xian nanjing and shanghai 
among the arrested in shanghai were li zhibo a leader of the 
independent workers union and yao yongzhan a 19yearold hong kong 
student 
li was shown being held at gunpoint by police it appeared he had 
been beaten his face was swollen so badly he could barely open his 
eyes 
protest supporters in shanghai chinas largest city with 12 
million people said monday that authorities had snuffed out the 
democracy movement there through intimidation and arrests 
in its statement the ministry of public security banned student 
and worker groups that headed the prodemocracy movement and 
ordered their leaders to turn themselves in immediately if they 
didnt they would be punished severely it said 
chinese media accused the voice of america listened to widely in 
china of spreading rumors about the disturbances

the battle for control of the nations largest 
protestant denomination enters its 11th year tuesday with moderates 
making an 11th hour bid for the presidency of the southern 
baptist convention 
i think the southern baptist convention is in serious 
condition serious trouble said daniel vestal the moderate 
candidate for the convention presidency a lot of people are at 
the point of dropping out 
paul pressler a houston judge who has helped rally conservatives 
to 10 straight presidential victories in the convention since 1979 
said a win by moderates would result in confusion and turmoil 
for a few more years 
the course correction has been made pressler said 
convention officials expect 15000 messengers or delegates for 
the threeday meeting that opens tuesday morning 
the focus of the convention is the presidential election tuesday 
afternoon with the 44yearold vestal trying to unseat jerry vines 
51 moyers withdrew a request to 
appear before the executive committee to discuss its criticism of 
his god and politics documentary the committee in february said 
the documentary was biased in support of southern baptist moderates 
referring to pressler moyers said in a letter to the committee 
there is no way to get a fair hearing from an executive committee 
that has become a rubber stamp for a secular politician who has 
infected this christian fellowship with the partisan tactics of 
malice manipulation and untruth 
conservatives who take the bible as literal truth accuse 
moderates of being open to interpretations that challenge the 
foundations of southern baptist faith 
beyond question the central issue is theological vines 
said i believe that the bible does not merely contain the word of 
god but that the bible is the word of god 
if one questions part of the truth of the bible he said 
everything is open to question including accounts of the 
resurrection of christ 
but moderates charge conservatives with violating another central 
belief of southern baptists that believers can interpret the bible 
for themselves 
i think the issue is freedom are we going to be free or are we 
going to be a controlled denomination said vestal pastor of 
dunwoody baptist church in suburban atlanta are we going to be 
creedal or noncreedal 
stan hastey executive director of the southern baptist alliance 
in washington said the dispute revisits the battleground of 
american protestantism in the early 20th century 
the key questions are questions like were adam and eve real 
people was the world created in six 24hour periods he said 
the moderates respond those questions are theologically 
irrelevant

former rep john jenrette dsc on 
probation from bribery and conspiracy convictions in a noted 
congressional scandal of the 1970s monday was found guilty for the 
second time of shoplifting shoes and clothes from a suburban 
washington department store 
after deliberating for 35 minutes the fairfax county circuit 
court jury found jenrette guilty of petty larceny through switching 
price tags at marshalls discount department store in tysons corner 
on dec 7 
the jury recommended a 1000 fine and six months in jail for 
each of the two misdemeanor charges but the fact that jenrette was 
on probation could greatly lengthen that term 
this could trigger three years extra in prison said defense 
attorney steve merril its a tremendous setback to his life 
sentencing was set for aug 18 
upon hearing the verdict jenrette sat motionless and stared 
straight ahead he was whisked out a back door and did not speak 
with reporters 
jenrette had been found guilty on both charges by fairfax circuit 
county circuit judge donald b mcdonough on feb 23 he appealed 
that verdict in an attempt to bring his case before a jury where he 
felt he could succeed in creating reasonable doubt 
but the jury believed marshalls store guards who said they saw 
jenrette leave the store wearing stolen shoes and carrying a tie 
that he had pocketed off a rack 
guard heather mckeever said she also saw jenrette remove the 
price tags from a pair of pants and a shirt and replace them with 
the tags from lowerpriced merchandise 
ms mckeever also said she saw jenrette try on a pair of 
marshalls shoes and place his own in the bottom row of the stores 
shoe rack 
when jenrette walked out of the store he was apprehended by ms 
mckeever and guard john brown who supported her testimony in court 
jenrette testifying in his own behalf said he flat forgot 
that he was wearing the new shoes 
i had them on for 3540 minutes and embarrasingly forgot i had 
them on he said he denied switching price tags and claimed the 
tie in his pocket was his own that he had brought into the store to 
compare with a tie he was considering purchasing 
part of merrils defense was the fact that jenrette left behind a 
125 pair of shoes and that the camera used by the security guards 
didnt give an accurate depiction of events 
assistant commonthwealths attorney william pickett in his 
closing argument called jenrettes story totally fiction and 
said the evidence against the former lawmaker was overwhelming 
jenrette who served in congress from 1975 to 1980 was sentenced 
to two years in prison and five years probation after being 
convicted in the abscam sting operation in which fbi agents posing 
as arab sheiks and businessmen offered bribes to lawmakers 
jenrette served 13 months in prison and is currently on probation

ronald bishop who designed britains wooden 
wonder mosquito aircraft in world war ii and the comet jetliner 
shortly after the war has died family death notices said tuesday 
he was 86 
after the war bishop designed other military and civil aircraft 
and the worlds first commercial jet airliner the comet which fell 
victim to the hitherto unknown phenomenon of metal fatigue 
bishop joined the de havilland company when he was 18 and worked 
his way through the metal fitting and engine workshops before 
entering the drawing office in 1923 
the air ministry rejected his idea for a fast bomber built of 
wood a year before the war began but bishop and the company built 
it anyway and the dh98 mosquito became one of the most versatile 
military planes ever built for day and night fighting bombing and 
photographic reconnaissance 
it was made of two layers of plywood sandwiching a layer of balsa 
wood twin rollsroyce merlin engines powered the mosquito to 380 
mph faster than any enemy fighter so it did not have to carry 
defensive guns or armor later versions sped at 425 mph and doubled 
the bomb load to 4000 pounds 
mosquito night fighters destroyed 600 german planes over germany 
a like number of german v1 flying bombs over england and marked 
targets for night bombing of germany by laying flares 
the most spectacular mosquito raids were the september 1942 
attack that destroyed the headquarters of the gestapo secret police 
in oslo norway and the february 1944 attack on amiens jail in 
france which helped 258 french resistance fighters escape 
an obituary in londons daily telegraph said bishop got the idea 
for the mosquito when he saw a stuffed pike in a glass case and 
penciled a similar streamlined outline on the back of an envelope 
the fish had been caught before world war i by sir winston 
churchill britains leader in world war ii 
bishop lived at harpenden 25 miles northwest of london and is 
survived by his wife nora and two sons 
family notices said he died sunday but gave no cause or place of 
death

sergei grigoryants a soviet magazine 
publisher once imprisoned as a dissident received the international 
federation of newspaper publishers 1989 golden pen of freedom 
award on monday 
a few years ago the golden pen of freedom had no place in the 
ussr and countless other places grigoryants said speaking

glasnost in 1987 he began publication soon after his release 
from a soviet labor camp where he had been imprisoned in 1983 for 
publishing bulletin v an underground newspaper on human rights

his editing and publishing equipment destroyed for writing stories 
about the kgb immigration rules and the destruction of judicial 
archives said professor lord mcgregor of durris england and 
chairman of the committee that searches for golden pen honorees 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev has described glasnost as 
a parasite funded by the west mcgregor said 
grigoryants responded a really free press is not popular with 
anyone in power not only in the soviet union but in the west too 
the golden pen award was created in 1961 to recognize the 
oustanding actions of an individual group or institution in favor 
of freedom of the press in 1988 the award was given posthumously

40000 the auction house reported 
the 57page manuscript of the draft of the constitution contains 
notes by robespierre on aspects of the first constitution prepared 
in 1791 by the national assembly 
other items auctioned included documents from the bloody events 
of 200 years ago they included papers relating to king louis xvis 
trial that led to his conviction for treason and subsequent 
execution at the guillotine 
the guillotine whose use was advocated by dr joseph guillotin 
during the french revolution in preference to less humane methods 
was first used in 1792 
a twopage handwritten letter dated oct 10 1789 from queen 
marie antoinette to the austrian ambassador in paris was bought 
19000 by a french collector who also asked to remain anonymous 
it describes the queens departure from the palace at versailles 
four days earlier and declares her belief that the bourgeoisie and 
the people were on her side and would prevail even though they 
were weaker than the revolutionaries 
all the texts of marieantoinettes correspondance are in the 
archives in vienna but most of the original letters have 
disappeared said jean chalon author of a recent biography of the 
austrianborn queen 
this is a rare look at marieantoinette and you can be sure 
its an original because its full of spelling mistakes 
known as the incorruptible robespierre sent some 17000 
people to the guillotine during the yearlong reign of terror that 
came to a climax with his own beheading in 1794 
his notes in the constitutional draft show that he opposed 
creation of a legislative branch composed of representatives elected 
by the people 
his notes also oppose the national assemblys plan to limit the 
vote to those paying taxes worth three days work 
wealth corrupts more than poverty robespierre wrote in the 
margin of the text millionaires are the ones who should be 
excluded from voting

dominos pizza incs 30minute delivery 
guarantee is being challenged by area residents after an accident 
that claimed a 17yearolds life the latest in a series of wrecks 
involving company drivers 
the dead youths relatives and friends are circulating petitions 
asking indianas congressional members to seek federal restrictions 
on dominos promise to deliver an order within 30 minutes or cut the 
price by 3 
i dont want another mother to have to go through what ive 
been through said suzanne boutros whose son jesse colson died 
june 3 while speeding to deliver a pizza for a dominos store in 
mooresville almost 18 miles southwest of here 
the plainfield youths small pickup truck went off a 
rainslickened road and hit a utility pole two miles east of 
mooresville authorities said 
its awful ms boutros said sunday but there are still 
thousands of kids all across the country out there doing the same 
thing 
she called dominos guarantee an invitation to break the law 
to speed 
dominos officials said its drivers do not have to speed to make 
the deadline 
the night before colsons death a dominos deliveryman in 
shelbyville nearly 30 miles southeast of indianapolis was involved 
in an accident near there but no one was seriously injured 
three dominos drivers were involved in traffic accidents last 
year in hendricks county alone said authorities in colsons home 
county 
dominos does not keep accident totals spokesman ron hingst said 
from the 5000store chains headquarters in ann arbor mich 
colson a plainfield high school junior had worked as a 
deliveryman since january 
we had discussed it ms boutros said he didnt like it i 
didnt like it 
colsons girlfriend kelly lowe 17 who also works for dominos 
said workers who tallied the largest number of late deliveries 
received a badge that read king of lates colson had never 
received the badge 
he didnt like to have late pizzas miss lowe said he 
always talked about how he never had any lates 
dominos maintains its pizzas are made in 10 to 15 minutes 
allowing ample time for orders to be delivered 
if people would go visit our stores and see this system in 
action i think it would help them understand thats where the 
speed of our system is said hingst 
steve osmun who owns the mooresville franchise said he urges 
employees to offer the discount before endangering their lives 
we dont advocate anyone speeding osmun said 
he said he was unaware of the king of lates badge and does 
not approve of it

labor organizers say more and more doctors are 
joining the ranks of several unions nationwide a trend that could 
change the rules by which medical professionals play 
before doctors take the lives of others into their hands they 
take a hippocratic oath to act with purity and with holiness a 
mandate that raises ethical questions about whether a doctors 
walkout would say stop a parent from rushing a sick child past 
pickets and into an emergency room 
still does that oath deprive doctors of the right to protect 
their own interests financial and otherwise 
union proponents and medical ethicists say no up to a point 
dr sanford a marcus president of the union of american 
physicians and dentists said his oakland califbased consortium 
has 50000 members and is growing he said members affiliated 
through a number of offshoots around the country are working 
together to advocate the rights of both physicians and their 
patients

one of the worlds rare beauties rachel ward 
could be amply employed in americanmade films instead she opts to 
live in australia with husband bryan brown and two daughters and 
choose her roles with care 
i have been working but not in hollywood she says ive 
been working in australia and england quite a bit doing things that 
may have a smaller profile but stimulate me more than the stuff i 
was doing in hollywood 
i guess i would have to live here if i wanted to work here 
also im not american as youve probably assessed by now that 
narrows the field for things that im right for 
part of the frustration i felt in working here was having to 
homogenize myself i was asked to lessen my accent and make it more 
midatlantic they still wanted to keep me english but not so that 
it was not understandable i think that stifles ones own 
uniqueness in a sense being able to do australian and english 
products sort of released me for that a bit i was able to use my 
own expression 
one of her english films is the current release how to get 
ahead in advertising it comes from george harrisons handmade 
films written and directed by bruce robinson who wrote the 
killing fields and made his directorial debut with the critically 
acclaimed withnail and i 
how to get ahead in advertising tells of a top advertising 
man richard e grant who suddenly rebels and leads a crusade 
against what he considers the manipulation of the ad world 
ive done comedy before like dead men dont wear plaid but 
nothing so bold and original said the actress who plays the ad 
mans bewildered wife 
i think the advertising business is used as a sort of metaphor 
for what bruce is raging about in the film there is a number of 
occupations you could have used that would have said the same thing 
it could be part of the show business scene as well 
ward remembers that seeing butch cassidy and the sundance kid 
as an english schoolgirl started her toward an acting career i 
really wanted to be katharine ross she said that was a world 
that appealed to my sense of romance 
she became a top model in london then came to new york at 18 to 
become lincolnmercurys cougar girl revlons scoundrel girl and 
joe namaths date for brut burt reynolds happened to see her in a 
time magazine ad and chose her for a role in sharkeys machine 
then came her hollywood period against all odds with jeff 
bridges dead men dont wear plaid 
her most prominent role came as the heroine of the thorn 
birds in the miniseries she rejected bryan brown as a suitor but 
accepted him in real life she married the australian actor in 
chipping norton england six years ago they now have two 
daughters rosie and matilda and make their home in sydney 
the international film scene isnt everything she remarked 
there are very interesting things going on in australia and 
britain things as worth while or more so to be involved in than in 
hollywood 
we live a lowkey life in australia spending much of it on a 
farm in the outback of new south wales i do whatever you do on a 
working farm milk cows pluck chickens mend fences that kind of

citizens in the 12 nations of the 
european economic community are electing a new european parliament 
and for the first time the candidates they choose will have real 
power 
in the past few years the strasbourgbased parliament has been 
rapidly shedding the image of an unwieldy overfunded talking shop 
now it will be an institution with more power and responsibility 
than at any time in its 37year history 
the voting is today june 15 in five countries and on sunday 
june 18 in the remaining seven results are expected june 19 
yet old impressions die hard polls and other predictions in 
several countries including west germany and france indicate 
little public interest in the european elections that seat a new 
parliament every five years 
in some countries including italy france and spain what 
interest the elections have generated is related more to the 
ramifications for domestic politics of which candidates win 
the danger for the parliament is that a low turnout among the 120 
million eligible voters could undermine the legitimacy of the 
institution just as it is gaining more power parliament members 
have long asserted that they speak most directly for the 360 million 
citizens of the european economic community and therefore should be 
a far more central element in community decisionmaking 
among the results likely are an increase in the number of greens 
the environmentbased political movements in the parliament and a 
falloff in members from extreme rightwing parties these are likely 
to have little overall effect however on the parliament which has 
traditionally been somewhat left of center and is already 
sympathetic to environmental concerns 
the elections will be the third time that voters have directly 
elected the parliaments 518 members until the first elections in 
june 1979 the deputies were appointed by the governments of the 
member states 
the number of members each nation can send to the parliament 
depends on its population britain france germany and italy each 
have 81 seats luxembourg has just 6 spain has 60 the netherlands 
25 portugal belgium and greece have 24 each denmark has 16 and 
ireland 15 
within the parliaments huge modernistic chamber in strasbourg 
however members neither sit nor vote by nationality instead they 
work in eight political groupings each with members from several 
nations that cover the west european ideological spectrum there is 
also a small group of independents 
those elected will have many powers to shape the legislation that 
will rule the single european market the community plans to initiate 
in 1992 the parliaments powers were significantly expanded in 1987 
the parliament however is seeking an even bigger say in eec 
affairs the most powerful body at present in the eec is the council 
of ministers made up of delegates from each member government 
advocates of more parliamentary power say the domination of 
community decisionmaking by a handful of people responsible only to 
their own governments is a disservice to the eecs overall citizenry 
this democratic gap will be a hot issue in the parliaments 
next fiveyear term says gijs de vries a parliament member from 
the netherlands who has been particularly active in the bodys 
operations 
other key issues he says will include details of how the single 
market will work environmental consumer and social issues and the 
eecs relationship with the rest of the world 
the parliament has a crucial role in this last area because trade 
cooperation agreements cannot take effect until a majority of the 
parliament approves them the parliament also must sign off on 
applications from nations that want to join the community 
the parliament also issues resolutions on current affairs a 
large number of which reflect concern with human rights abuses and 
environmental issues 
the voting begins june 15 in britain denmark ireland the 
netherlands and spain belgium france greece italy luxembourg 
portugal and west germany follow on sunday june 18

the republicans split political personality is 
showing 
it may be wearing a bit thin but its there president bush 
remains the innocent bystander cast as the man on the high road 
chiding his own lowroad lieutenants for their excesses 
but there was an echo of bushs own 1988 presidential campaign in 
a disowned gop attack on tom foley the new speaker of the house 
that echo was in the premise not the particulars of a 
republican national committee memo attacking foley the memo was 
headed tom foley out of the liberal closet 
liberal the l word was fashioned into a political curse by 
the bush campaign it was used effectively to make the case that 
gov michael dukakis was not moderate democratic problem solver but 
a kneejerk liberal 
that was the theme of the attack on foley but it added innuendo 
comparing the new speakers record with that of an openly homosexual 
congressman saying foley should come out of the liberal closet 
the author was a republican publicist who worked for the 1988 
bush campaign as a deputy press secretary the memo cost him his job 
lee atwater then campaign manager now chairman of the 
republican committee shaped the attack strategy of the bush 
campaign while the white house says the season for that is gone 
negative campaigning apparently is easier to turn on than turn off 
atwater said he did not know about the memo and would not have 
issued it if he had 
a day earlier before bush and other republican leaders had 
denounced the attack on foley atwater called the memo factually 
correct and no big deal anyhow 
it was disgusting its against everything ive tried to 
stand for in political life bush said at his press conference 
thursday night but i discussed that matter with lee atwater and 
he looked me right in the eye and said he did not know about it he 
moved promptly to remove the person that did know about it so i 
accept that 
the ousted republican was mark goodin communications director 
for the national commitee who wrote a memo addressed to 
republican leaders noting foleys high approval rating by 
americans for democratic action his opposition to capital 
punishment and his votes against aid to the nicaraguan contras 
it went out the day before foley was installed as speaker of the 
house to succeed the resigned jim wright 
the goodin attack painted foley as a doctrinaire liberal by 
likening the speakers record to that of rep barney frank dmass 
a liberal who also is gay it was frank who first put the public 
spotlight on the implications of the memo saying it was part of a 
gop campaign of rumor against democrats 
republicans in congress and at the white house disowned the memo 
and the author foley called it a cheap smear but he said atwater 
had telephoned him to apologize and that he considered the matter 
closed 
during the campaign that won him the office bush repeatedly 
denied that his was a negative campaign although thats where the 
push against dukakis was all thats left is this daily whining 
about a negative campaign bush said near the end dont listen 
to the crying on the far left 
but bush has a different role now he needs no wars with 
democrats especially with a new and popular speaker of the house 
he needs democratic votes in order to govern 
the president feels he set a new tone when he took office and 
that tone should be continued said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater and that tone is one of bipartisanship 
but that message isnt reaching every corner of the party after 
years of getting along and losing minority republicans in the house 
are trying a more aggressive strategy of political attack that 
isnt about to change theyre just getting started 
that points to more tough talk and tough politics 
as he became speaker foley said he hoped to see a change in the 
atmosphere in congress bush said hed like to change that too 
although he insisted it wasnt caused by republicans any more than 
democrats 
the ugliness of this climate is bad and i dont like it and id 
like to think that i could help bush said

a decision to work late in her highrise 
office building put kathleen quinlans character in the wrong place 
at the wrong time 
in the usa network movie trapped quinlan plays marianne the 
building manager who is caught inside the building first with a 
thief then with a killer 
what i like about it is that shes not a woman who thinks of 
herself as a fighter said quinlan but when she finds herself 
in this situation she has to pull herself together and fight her way 
through it 
quinlan calls trapped a female version of die hard the 
feature film starring bruce willis which was set in a los angeles 
highrise as the terrorists robberyhostage drama unfolded 
this is about a man whose family has been killed by toxic waste 
dumped by a huge corporation she said when he hits the 
building an industrial thief and myself are trapped in the 
building we become the target so it becomes more oneonone than 
die hard 
usually this kind of movie is maleoriented i loved doing all 
the physical stuff i did all the stunts except going off the 
building im a jock so if i get a role where i can act and do 
something physical ill take it the character of marianne wasnt 
written in depth so i put myself in her shoes and developed the 
character myself it was all taken very seriously but its really a 
fun entertainment piece 
the movie which also stars bruce abbott as john the thief has 
its premiere wednesday on the usa network it was written by fred 
walton who directed it on location in dallas 
we filmed in dallas because they have some incredible buildings 
there quinlan said we shot it indoors at night im a very 
outdoor person and im not a night person this girl likes to close 
her eyes at 1030 we worked from 6 at night until 6 in the morning 
it has a lot of action so you really had to be on your toes 
im a former gymnast and so is bruce abbott and it really 
helped we did one stunt with an explosion trust me if id known 
it was going to explode so big i wouldnt have done it our stunt 
people were very good and they had to test me before letting me do 
the stunts 
quinlan recently completed a stage role in les liaisons 
dangereuse at the ahmanson theatre in los angeles 
she has been in such movies as american graffiti 
lifeguard i never promised you a rose garden the 
promise the runner stumbles sunday lovers hanky 
panky and sunset among her tv movies are shes in the army 
now when she says no blackout and children of the 
night 
quinlan grew up in the san francisco suburb of mill valley where 
she was a gymnast and diver she made her film debut in one is a 
lonely number doubling for trish van devere in a high dive 
sequence 
i was 17 at the time she said they came to our high 
school and looked at the diving team i did american graffiti 
because they had a cattle call audition at our school i went in and 
read for a part never thinking in a million years id do any acting 
i had a dream of going to the olympics it took me a long time 
to get over it but i got to keep my athletics to myself in college 
i was running back and forth between acting and athletic training 
my coach said i had to make a choice and get my priorities straight 
finally i chose acting

editors note some 8 million americans claim to know from 
experience what it feels like to die they tell of disembodied 
travels through dark tunnels at immeasurable speeds of being bathed 
in a brilliant white or golden light that conveys feelings of peace 
and love of seeing the minutiae of their lives replayed are these 
merely hallucinations induced by drugs or anesthesia perhaps but 
most of the people who have had a neardeath experience are never 
the same again

it might have been the effects of 
painkillers that changed steve prices life it might have been a 
surge of bioenergy that some mystics believe lies dormant in us all 
then again it maatever it was that kept price from firing his gun 
again after 
he was nearly killed by a mortar fragment in vietnam in 1965 has 
never been measured or analyzed or scanned no one knows so any 
theory could apply 
regardless prices neardeath experience continues to shape his 
life years later the same holds true for many of the 8 million 
americans who claim to know from experience what it feels like to 
die 
nine years after her neardeath experience barbara harris walked 
away from her husband and three kids she couldnt reconcile her 
privileged lifestyle with a need to help others that was born when 
her life flashed before her revealing each ripple her actions had 
caused in the lives of others 
just as many people cant remember their dreams the majority of 
people who come close to death dont recall it but the 25 percent 
to 30 percent who do invariably give similar descriptions 
neardeath experiencers tell of disembodied travels through dark 
tunnels at immeasurable speeds of being bathed in a brilliant white 
or golden light that conveys feelings of peace and love far beyond 
any earthly emotion of seeing the minutiae of their lives replayed 
for their edification 
some report joyful reunions with deceased loved ones who 
communicate telepathically others tell of encounters with a divine 
presence or energy force they describe as the source of all love of 
comprehending for a mindreeling instant the secrets of the 
universe of the anguish and sorrow that accompanies their reluctant 
return to the living 
the descriptions are similar in india and japan with cultural 
variations a buddhist wont see jesus for example psychoanalyst 
karl jung had a neardeath experience in the mid1940s english 
philosopher sir alfred j ayer one of the worlds prominent 
atheists had one just last year ayer wrote that it slightly 
weakened my conviction that my genuine death which is due fairly 
soon will be the end of me though i continue to hope that it will 
be 
the scientists who study ndes havent been lucky enough to be 
around during one so they can only chronicle the effects nders 
invariably profess to have lost all fear of death many feel angry 
and disappointed at being revived i felt so restricted so 
trapped in this body says al sullivan of east hartford whose nde 
came during his heart surgery last year 
but even those whose ndes resulted from suicide attempts seldom 
try to return the things that made people suicidal before are no 
longer meaningful says bruce greyson a psychiatry professor at 
the university of connecticut medical center who has interviewed 
thousands of nders over 15 years of study people see their role 
in the universeatlarge they see why theyre here to take care 
of a family raise a child write a book 
virtually all nders emerge with an unwavering belief in a higher 
power regardless of their prior convictions at the same time 
organized religion tends to lose its meaning 
the god i met loves everyone its generic says kate 
valentine of oxford conn a catholic before her 1981 nde ive 
become very unreligious 
many adopt less materialistic lives and a large number change 
careers often becoming nurses volunteers or social workers 
if a person was very materialistic before his whole life may 
be disrupted greyson says relationships often break up 
especially if they were based on materialism and power for a 
successful businessman that could mean not being able to return to 
the job 
kenneth ring a professor of psychology at the university of 
connecticut at storrs has studied ndes since 1976 and has written 
two books on the subject people become life appreciators he 
says they dont care about success fame or fortune they want to 
sail their boats on long island sound 
nders often develop a deep hunger for spiritual understanding 
along with a fervent desire to see world conditions improve they 
tend to become more selfconfident and less passive often they 
like themselves better 
i do miss financial security but what really matters is 
love says harris 46 whose nde followed back surgery in 1975 
complications set in her condition deteriorated and harris passed 
out in her bed 
she came to in the hospital corridor 
i turned to go back into my room my first thought was that 
id get in trouble for being out of bed then i discovered i was 
looking directly into a speaker that was mounted on the ceiling 
confusion if im here whats in the bed soon gave way 
to pure sensation i felt my grandmother holding me cradling 
me the feeling was so soothing so familiar that moments passed 
before harris remembered her grandmother had been dead for 10 years 
she returned to her body but a week later still bedridden she 
had a vision i drew out of my body and relived my life all 32 
years in an instant 
i heard myself saying no wonder no wonder you are the way 
you are i felt all the slates being wiped clean i understood the 
reasons behind everything that had ever happened to me it was the 
most healing therapy there could be 
the barbara harris who entered the hospital had filled her days 
with garden club meetings the one who left felt drawn to hospital 
emergency rooms she became a hospital volunteer then a respiratory 
and massage therapist 
ultimately harris packed her clothes and her stereo into her 
saab and drove away from her home backyard pool and private plane 
now she rents a tiny apartment in newington which she shares with 
two of her children 
she addresses nurses clergy and others who counsel the dying 
and volunteers as greysons research assistant she also leads 
monthly meetings of one of the two dozen nde support groups that 
have sprung up around the nation 
an nders need for support is enormous says harris you cant 
stay the way you are and your loved ones dont want you to change

many medical professionals dismiss ndes as drug or 
anesthesiainduced hallucinations others attribute them to lack of 
oxygen to the brain or to the release of some stressrelated 
chemicals 
death is a state dying is a process says debunker richard 
blacher a psychiatry professor at tufts university and the new 
england medical center hospital blacher favors the anesthesia 
explanation and says those who claim to have died are making an 
error in logic 
driving to new york city is not the same as new york city he 
says youre not going to get a taste of new york by driving 
there 
while the argument continues better resuscitation techniques and 
new medical procedures are making close calls with death 
increasingly common a 1982 gallup poll that reported 8 million 
adult american nders also called that a conservative estimate as 
the numbers grow so does the conviction among a handful of 
scientists that neardeath experiences warrant serious study 
our understanding of death has a tremendous impact on how we 
treat people who are dealing with death people who are suicidal 
people who are facing their own deaths or grieving the deaths of 
loved ones says greyson research director of the international 
association of neardeath studies a 700member nonprofit group 
that spreads information sponsors research and provides support 
services 
though poor proof of an afterlife ndes are powerful catalysts 
for change says greyson who has interviewed thousands of nders 
including a former mafia hit man who now counsels spouse abusers in 
ohio a respected college professor who quit his job to hitchhike 
crosscountry a laborer with a high school education who immersed 
himself in quantum physics after waking up one night and blurting 
out the word quantum neither he nor his wife knew what it meant 
just as radical as some nders transformations are the hypotheses 
posed to explain them 
kundalini sanskrit for coiled up refers to a subtle form 
of bioenergy said to lie dormant at the base of the spine when 
activated the energy travels through channels chakras in the 
body resulting in physical and psychological fireworks kundalini 
theorists believe such awakenings are capable of catapulting 
individuals into states of higher consciousness similar to ndes and 
with equally profound effects 
kundalini awakenings achieved through spiritual disciplines such 
as yoga and meditation can cause transformations virtually 
indistinguishable from those of neardeath experiencers the fact 
that such parallels exist doesnt prove a common cause ring says 
though it does at least suggest the possibility that there may be 
a general biological process that underlies them both 
if so the seeming profusion of ndes in recent years could 
represent an evolutionary mechanism some scientists have suggested 
designed to propel all of humanity toward higher consciousness 
whatever the cause theres no denying the effect ring says 
the person you become is really different the person you were is 
lost 
steve price of killingworth was nearly killed when a mortar 
fragment pierced his lung near da nang a onetime schoolyard bully 
ive become so sensitive that when other people hurt i can feel 
it i talk to people about metaphysical things before i wouldve 
made fun of them 
a thickset man whose forearms are mapped with dark tattoos price 
still gets teary as he recalls the summer night he relived his life 
in an instant while waiting for a corpsman to reach him three days 
later the wounded marine was wheeled into surgery at a field 
hospital but prices consciousness took a detour and wound up on 
the ceiling 
a white light encompassed me it took me in i felt such warmth 
and peacei didnt say the word god for a long time but now i 
can say that the light was god it was like the most loving mother 
embracing her infant only a million times more than that 
recovered price returned to vietnam i led my unit i did all 
the things i was supposed to but i never shot my gun all i ever 
wanted was to be a marine but i realized i couldnt do my job 
instead he joined the connecticut national guard because it 
helps people instead of going to war 
before my nde i was afraid to die even though i was in the 
business of killing he says i was so afraid to die that i 
couldnt live 
nders dont just describe spiritual transformations they also 
talk of physical changes that greyson and ring are trying to measure 
people often report that their vital signs change their 
respiratory rates their heart rates greyson says beyond that 
very great changes are reported in the ways they metabolize food and 
drugs in heightened sensitivities to light sounds smells tastes 
some cant tolerate perfume some cant drink alcohol 
kate valentine a mother of three from long island resigned 
herself to die when a lung infection circulation problems and an 
irregular heartbeat followed her 1981 surgery for thyroid cancer 
after being sick for a long time you become physically and 
emotionally whipped she says 
one night her affairs in order valentine fell asleep in her bed 
and awoke at the edge of a valley the colors were incredible as 
if all my life id been looking at the wrong side of a tapestry 
then suddenly turned it over 
she saw no one yet felt a loving peaceful presence beside her 
i wanted to go into the valley but was told telepathically 
no the next morning she awoke without pain my heart wasnt 
skipping beats or pounding or anything my hands were normal they 
had been almost black 
the new kate valentine directs a senior citizens center and 
tries to help the troubled souls who cross her path with baffling 
regularity i could go on and on about the house cleaners who 
never cleaned the plumbers who never plumbed people on the brink 
of death bereavement tragedy somehow find their way to my door 
paul valentine a general contractor accompanies his wife to 
harris support group meetings and volunteers with her at a local 
soup kitchen they agree that kates nde strengthened their marriage 
for a long time she says she told no one not even her husband 
about the experience that prompted her to change her life then a 
friend of mine died of cancer suddenly i needed to know why i 
lived and she died no longer able to deny her experience 
valentine began trying to understand it 
shes still working on it like steve price barbara harris and 
countless others whose celestial wanderings took place in the blink 
of an eye but whose struggle to resume their earthly existence can 
continue for a lifetime 
nearly a quartercentury after he almost died steve price says 
hes finally beginning to live ive taken a long look at myself 
im just now seeing somebody in there whos worth saving

today spain is europes star economic performer eagerly 
marching toward 1992 when the common market nations internal trade 
barriers are to fall 
but there are signs of economic overheating and a new feeling of 
political uncertainty as socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez 
faces challenges from left and right 
spains new prosperity isnt felt by all and there are worries 
that the benefits of its economic transformation prosperity 
confidence optimism are being accompanied by less favorable 
changes this is prompting some soulsearching questions among 
spaniards about the young democracys direction 
in the rush to modernize spaniards are polluting their 
environment crime much of it drugrelated is on the rise and in 
the capital women clutch their purses to prevent their snatching 
but overriding the misgivings is a tremendous sense of vitality 
what some are calling a goldrush feeling as 1992 approaches 
in one generation you had people very scared about what was 
going to happen to their futures and now i think there is a lot more 
optimism says jorge hay a director of banco hispano americano 
for four years growth has been spurred by low oil prices strong 
global economic expansion agreed low wages tight money and 
restructuring to broaden the economic base major industries are 
textiles shoes agriculture tourism cars ships machinery and 
steel 
we have in process an extraordinary acceleration of 
modernization finance minister carlos solchaga said in a recent 
speech the economy really has strong momentum 
spains economy is expected to be europes fastestgrowing this 
year with a 45 percent growth rate after about 5 percent in the 
last two years 
spain has come a long way from the old stereotype images of 
flamenco dancers and bullfights madrid has become a prosperous 
almost antisepticlooking european capital 
the fashion statement in the city today is black the welltodo 
spanish are a graceful wellgroomed people who like to be admired 
the long lunch which begins after 2 pm is an enduring tradition 
menus list an astonishing array of seafood 
once strongly catholic spain has become increasingly secular 
the birth rate has fallen dramatically to 15 children for every 
woman from 28 in 1975 divorce was legalized 10 years ago abortion 
in 1985 young couples display a physical affection unheard of under 
franco 
another tradition that endures is the macho society 
few women hold positions of any power and only onethird work 
the lowest rate in the common market families remain 
maledominated although incongruously spanish women have always 
kept their maiden names and children are given both their parents 
surnames 
spains 1977 transition from isolationist dictatorship to 
democracy was relatively smooth 
franco who came into power after the 19361939 civil war that 
claimed a million lives died in 1975 his chosen successor king 
juan carlos i facilitated the creation of a new constitution the 
restored monarch and his family remain highly popular 
the constitution established 17 autonomous spanish regions some 
with their own language besides the official castilian regional 
differences are most starkly illustrated by the 21year basque 
separatist campaign which has claimed more than 600 lives 
confidence in spains democracy was bolstered by the failure of a 
1981 military coup and gonzalez was elected in 1982 backed by 
spains most prominent union the general workers union 
reelected in 1986 gonzalez must call the next election by june 
1990 and not so long ago he seemed invincible now many spaniards 
are convinced the former lawyer will win but that his socialist 
party will lose its parliamentary majority 
the factious right has gotten more organized while 47yearold 
gonzalez has clashed on the left with his main trade union ally 
general workers union chief nicolas redondo redondo supports the 
drive for growth but believes the wealth should be more widely 
spread 
gonzalez determination to dismantle spains tradition of 
lifetime employment is unpopular his relations with the unions 
soured further when the 3 percent inflation forecast used to 
negotiate wages agreement turned out to be way off the mark of 58 
percent

the unions showed their power to paralyze the country on dec 14 
when they persuaded 8 million spaniards to join a general strike 
ostensibly to protest a youth employment scheme which they believed 
threatened older workers 
critics complain that the socialists parliamentary majority has 
bred arrogrance and gonzalez who was a young personable man of 
the people when he was first elected is now called a man of the 
beautiful people 
madrids landscape is littered with construction cranes and rents 
have soared barcelona is preparing to host the olympics in 1992 and 
seville is getting ready to throw the worlds fair that year which 
is also the 500th anniversary of columbus discovery of america for 
the king and queen of spain 
the southern coasts are europes favorite sun belt attracting 
millions of vacationers and retirees 
spains new entrepreneurial spirit is underscored by soaring 
corporate profits and no fewer than four daily business newspapers 
attracted partly by its low wages many foreign investors are 
choosing spain as the place to set up their european base ahead of 
1992 foreign investment soared 70 percent last year to 44 billion 
dollars bringing new jobs training and advanced technology 
were very very high on spain said gary genaw managing 
director of atampt espana sa 
the government has begun to dismantle spains traditional trade 
protectionism and is collecting taxes more effectively madrids 
stock exchange is being deregulated and modernized and the 
governments ambitious privatization program recently led to the 
sale of a 27 percent stake in the repsol sa oil conglomerate for 
11 billion the biggestever sale of stock in spain 
spain joined the common market in 1986 and is readying for 1992 
with optimism and vigor determined to achieve some sort of parity 
with the rest of europe financially and technologically genaw 
says 
hay says there is a wave of mergers and alliances and 
acquisitions and all businesses are really reconsidering their 
european strategy 
his bank has set up branches in italy west germany and belgium 
and has launched an investment society in portugal 
the competition is going to be fierce because the foreign 
investors who are coming to spain want not just a foothold in europe 
but a share of the big spanish market spaniards will have to buy a 
lot of cars refrigerators and tv sets before they match europes 
average standard of living 
we expect much more competition in practically everything in 
every market and it makes you work harder hay says it should 
not be feared as long as youre in a growing market 
not everybody agrees 
its going to be a crisis says businessman jose luis 
rodriguez worried that his own industry aerospace products wont 
have room for all the new players 
now that the economy appears to be overheating spaniards are 
worrying that they have had too much of a good thing 
inflation although down from 145 percent in 1981 moved up to 
62 percent in february fueled by strong consumer spending the 
trade deficit grew 36 percent to 202 billion in 1988 
the bank of spain has reacted by pushing up interest rates more 
than 3 percentage points since september bringing key rates to 
about 14 percent 
although the boom has created many jobs spains 185 percent 
unemployment rate remains europes highest 
there is unease over spains new freemarket materialism its 
more conspicuous consumption while spains per capita gdp at about 
7400 remains a quarter below the european average 
from a social standpoint people are questioning whether 
individuals are partaking in the growth and enjoying in the 
wealth genaw says 
juan ignacio palacio an economics professor at the university of 
madrid says now the middle classes are being squeezed they feel 
impotent 
there are other serious problems 
spaniards complain of poor judicial medical and educational 
systems the weak infrastructure has been unable to match the pace 
of economic growth so traffic and telephones can be infuriating 
the big question is is spain gaining more than its losing 
that is something nobody is clear about palacio the 
professor says where do you find the equilibrium

editors note from arizona to massachusetts private land 
trusts are out to buy up natural habitats to save them from 
developers loggers and others who thirst to cash in trees and 
swampland for money but the private rescuers have limits consider 
michigans 300yearold estivant pines 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
preserving the wilderness once was 
left largely to the government now private trusts are buying up 
land across the country in an effort to save the unplowed the 
undrained and the undeveloped 
that much is obvious on the northern border of michigan on a 
spur of land that locals call the beginning of the world and 
tourists say is the end 
freelance naturalist jim rooks trudging deep into the stand of 
towering estivant pines on a recent day suddenly stops and points 
with the exuberance of a child there 
he almost topples over as he arches back to gaze up at the giant 
before him it is a gargantuan white pine 300 or more years old 
then rooks points out 19 wide tabletops of cut stumps now turned 
black he had come upon them in june 1987 
oh my god my heart rooks says recalling the warm 
sickening day with its buzz of saws every tree was a drop of 
blood 
rooks and other michigan environmentalists claim these giant pine 
trees of the keweenaw peninsula by lake superior are the largest 
most extensive stand of unprotected white pine in the eastern united 
states 
the logging company that owns the land is ready to harvest the 
trees yet for varied reasons neither the us forest service nor 
the michigan department of natural resources has tried to save the 
stand the federal government is concentrating on filling in gaps in 
existing national forests while the state never has formally 
considered saving the pines officials with both agencies say 
instead the battle for the estivant pines named for the french 
merchant who bought much of the local land in 1857 has fallen into 
private hands paid for by anonymous donors bluecollar 
philanthropists and gradeschool students 
it is conservationists say typical of new preservation efforts 
throughout the nation 
if the job is going to get done were going to have to roll up 
our own sleeves and do it as private citizens says russell van 
herik vice president for the national nature conservancys midwest 
region in minneapolis 
the nature conservancy is one of a growing number of private land 
trusts that are buying up land and protecting endangered species as 
quickly as donations to cover the purchases come in 
a survey by the national land trust exchange a coordinating body 
in alexandria va turned up 743 nonprofit land trusts across the 
united states last year up from 535 just three years before half 
of them have no staffs and less than 10000 a year to spend 
together their memberships amount to 640000 people 
they range from the newly formed kachemak bay heritage land trust 
in wildernessrich homer alaska to the 98yearold trustees of 
reservations in crowded massachusetts 
its an amazingly rapidly growing movement says jean hocker 
executive director of the exchange 
whats happened is a sense of real dismay of whats happening 
in communities a feeling that the people who live there have to 
take care of it hocker says as development pressures increase 
on the land people are realizing that protection of open land is 
the responsibility of all of us 
while private trusts also guard land for scenic views and 
playgrounds the strongest interest is in preserving ecologically 
important areas hocker says some trusts manage the sanctuaries on 
their own while others turn them over to government agencies for 
public parks and forests 
van herik says the nature conservancy considers itself the 
noahs ark of this country the national trust which centers its 
efforts on endangered species and ecologies has set aside 35 
million acres of land including 396 preserves in 12 midwestern 
states

despite their growth private land trusts wont replace 
government land programs a us forest service official says to 
us they are complimentary says harold bolt acting regional land 
director for the forest service in milwaukee wis 
the forest service has budgeted 2 million this year to buy land 
within national forests in ohio and illinois it plans to spend more 
than 20 million for the entire northeast 
but when it comes to land outside the national forests it takes 
an average of 10 years to identify study propose debate and 
designate land for federal acquisition says jane elder head of the 
sierra clubs midwest offices in madison wis 
land trusts can move more quickly less expensively and 
sometimes people will consider selling to private individuals when 
they wont even talk to the federal government hocker says 
and elder adds there is the worry that public designation as a 
wilderness area is a kiss of death to the virginity of land 
surrounded by population centers 
theres a lot of fear in the midwest that once land is 
designated it will get loved to death by backpackers trail 
bikes and others using it she says 
land trusts have cropped up in arizona wyoming and new mexico 
but they remain concentrated in the east and midwest where there is 
much development and little in the way of federal wilderness areas 
ohio has only 77 acres of federally protected wilderness elder 
says iowa has none 
in these areas private trusts are finding their land in small 
packages nestled among cornfields and smokestacks 
it doesnt look like yellowstone and it doesnt look like 
yosemite elder says but you can find quiet and solitude and 
virgin white pine and you can even get lost 
it takes a sophisticated citizenry to donate money for the 
seemingly unspectacular michigans buggy swamps illinois hilltop 
prairies and iowas freakish cool air slopes where snails from the 
ice age dwell 
ten years ago the idea of an important natural area was 
something that made you say oh it had to be 1000 feet high and 
there had to be waterfalls van herik says 
rooks didnt gamble on such sophistication in 1971 when the 
estivant pines first were timbered he told corporate landowners 
their loggers were felling the oldest trees in the midwest 
they could have been nobody knew rooks admits now 
either way the logging stopped long enough for the michigan 
nature association to buy 200 acres for 42145 the next 80 acres 
cost 100000 this may and the association is now negotiating for 
another 97 acres 
later rooks discovered among the pines the leaning giant a 
tilted monolith of a white pine that won michigan botanical society 
and national honors as the secondlargest white pine in the east 
before teetering to the ground in october 1987 
the michigan nature association since has learned the hard way 
that its remote island of trees is as vulnerable as the timber 
forest surrounding it a logger wandered into the estivant pines two 
years ago felling giant after giant before he realized he was in 
the wrong place 
now the lake superior land co says it will return to timber the 
rest of the virgin forest its either buy or cut says gary willis 
a commercial forester and a volunteer for the michigan nature 
association 
economically speaking the stand should be cut willis says 
but simply put well never see it again in our lifetimes 
anywhere 
preservation vs development isnt the issue says lake superior 
land co president bob grasseschi 
its simply economics the stand is mature its a natural 
resource like any that should be used in a responsible way 
grasseschi says its just a question of paying for that 
resource

editors note most of the canals have been filled in now and 
venice calif is hardly the cultural center it was envisioned to 
be back at the turn of the century in fact some would say this 
seaside suburb of los angeles which enjoyed a brief boom as an oil 
town is downright seedy but if youre looking for colorful 
characters from the counterculture you need look no farther

californiabound tourists tired of disneyland

town where everyday sights include a minstrel on roller skates and 
wilting flower children reading tarot cards 
patterned after its italian namesake and featuring a few 
surviving canals the onetime center of prohibitionera speakeasy 
night life was adopted by beat generation poets before hippies made 
it their southern california crash pad 
it is the home to fabled muscle beach and remains a 
counterculture haven for 1960sstyle peace protesters new age 
healers artists roller skaters surfers and scores of street 
performers acts range from a chainsaw tossing juggler to a limbo 
dancer prancing on a bed of broken glass 
this is america we come to see says ingrid nilsson 22 of 
sweden we can wear bikinis and go shopping 
competing for tourist dollars along bustling ocean front walk are 
peddlers offering rock crystals touted for their alleged healing 
powers tiedyed clothing and handmade jewelry sold on card tables 
storefront merchants sell souvenir tshirts sunglasses and hats 
sprinkled among the vendors are aging hippie fortunetellers 
peace activists selling bumper stickers and buttons caricature 
artists and masseuses including one who offers a standing massage

jeans strollers meander through clouds of incense chanting 
buddhists naked toddlers and pungent smoke wafting from marijuana 
joints puffed in the open 
cops walking their beats in short pants occasionally draw near 
undetected and move in to make a collar 
hungry visitors choose between takeout meals ranging from 
vegetarian fastfood to new yorkstyle pizza as they watch daredevil 
roller skaters jump hurdles or an elderly thrillseeker known as 
skateboard mama weave through a slalom course marked by empty cups 
venices eclectic allure has drawn such celebrity residents as 
charlie chaplin the late rock n roll star jim morrison 
sciencefiction author ray bradbury actordirector dennis hopper 
and actress lisa bonet of the cosby show 
sometimes called los angeles slum by the sea venice is 
sandwiched between upscale rentcontrolled santa monica to the 
north and the yachting yuppie enclave of marina del rey to the south 
venices liberal reputation draws hundreds of homeless people and 
teenage runaways to its alleyways in addition to musclebound 
bodybuilders skinhead punk rockers nude sunbathers and hordes of 
tourists 
it also has its share of rundown neighborhoods populated by 
violent street gangs drug dealers prostitutes and 
strawberries the slang name given to streetwalkers who sell 
themselves in exchange for drugs 
people who dont fit in anywhere else find a home here even if 
its only for a week or a night or an hour says oscar a 
bedraggled blues singer who declined to give his last name 
got me a little angel i love the way she spreads her wings 
oscar croons a grimy cap set on the ground to receive donations 
from appreciative passersby 
another venice street minstrel who has become something of a 
rolling landmark is harry parry a costumed guitar player who 
skates among the tourists every day pausing to serenade anyone 
willing to listen 
this beach is an oasis of light in a pool of darkness where 
we can all be who we are says parry who covers his massive 
dreadlock hairdo in a makeshift turban and wears baseball shin 
guards over his flowing robes as part of his distinctive outfit 
his skates are remnants of the 1970s when venice became the 
southern california center for disco rollerskating skaters still 
flock to venice including one known as tex who rolls on 
18inchtall stilt skates mounted to his cowboy boots 
venice was created soon after the turn of the century on 160 
acres about 15 miles west of downtown los angeles by tobacco 
millionaire abbot kinney who envisioned a stately cultural center 
serviced by an array of canals 
he imported singing gondoliers from italy to operate a flotilla 
of authentic venetian gondolas and officially opened the new 
community on july 4 1905 attractions included a carnival pier and 
a miniature railroad 
kinneys highbrow dreams of a fine arts center fizzled developed 
instead were bawdy vaudeville acts gin joints gambling dens and 
freak shows 
its main daytime attraction was a covered bathhouse that featured 
heated sea water and 600 private dressing rooms for modest bathers 
actress sarah bernhardt performed at the 3400seat venice 
auditorium in 1906 and reportedly made 20 curtain calls during three 
soldout shows but few other celebrities of note came to venice 
other than to gamble or sample the racy night life 
perhaps the first person to ride the surf at venice was olympic 
swimmer duke kahanamoku a hawaiian native considered to be the 
father of modern wave riding historians report he rode a redwood 
surfboard near the popular pier in the first decade of the 20th 
century 
most of the original canals were filled in during the 1930s and 
not long afterward venice became an oil boom town dotted with 
derricks which were dismantled later when the crude dried up 
venice is to beach towns what berkeley is to college towns and 
fueling its diverse avantgarde image are chic art galleries 
trendy coffeehouses and pricey restaurants 
further contrasts are provided by fortresslike remodeled homes 
surrounded by fences topped with razorsharp barbed wire that stand 
alongside dilapidated seaside cottages some occupied by several 
families 
prominent in the gentrification of venice is 72 market street a 
dinner house opened by tony bill producer of such films as 
shampoo and the sting with the help of investors such as 
actor dudley moore who occasionally drops in to play the piano 
topping a long list of serious art sellers in venice is the la 
louver gallery which introduced internationally renowned painter 
david hockney to southern california 
a popular gathering spot to see and be seen over espresso and 
croissants is the rose cafe where aspiring actors read scripts 
before auditions writers scribble in notebooks and occasionally a 
working actor like gary busey stops in for a bite

editors note when he won the van cliburn competition in fort 
worth texas in 1973 it seemed that the world of vladimir viardo 
had changed forever but it led to a musical odyssey that found him 
back in the soviet union locked away from western audiences now he 
seems to have found a happy ending 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one night in a ukrainian village vladimir viardo 
was playing a chopin barcarole when he noticed cockroaches crawling 
out of the keyboard even more disconcerting was the horse and cart 
that failed to negotiate a uturn on the road outside the hall and 
crashed through a window and onto the stage 
that was during the 13 years when viardo was forbidden to leave 
the eastern bloc before he became the first soviet artist to be 
allowed to move to the west with his family while retaining his 
citizenship 
this spring viardo played a very different venue at carnegie 
hall he punctuated his concert by pounding his fist on the keyboard 
of a steinway grand piano sweeping it across the keys to a bass 
note and an electrifying ovation 
for years i collected rage and i could hit he says once 
youve tasted freedom you dont want to be subdued anymore 
in december he moved into a new york apartment with his wife and 
two sons with the approval of the soviet government unlike many 
of his colleagues he did not defect and continues to perform in his 
native land 
i didnt want to leave forever russian nostalgia is a very 
strong feeling says the 39yearold pianist in fluent 
slavicaccented english 
but the pull of the new world particularly texas is equally 
strong 
i have such a special feeling for texas such tenderness he 
says it is a sort of native land for me i spiritually recognize 
it 
it was there in fort worth that viardos us career began in 
1973 when his musical panache and vast technical arsenal carried 
him to victory in the van cliborn competition a twoyear tour of 
the west ensued but on the eve of a 1976 us trip soviet 
officials canceled all his foreign engagements one by one over 
three weeks without an explanation 
for years viardos performances were confined to the soviet 
union and a few east bloc countries most of his 80 yearly concerts 
were played in the biggest halls on the best pianos and he was 
wellknown to soviet audiences but he also brought music to the 
farmers sometimes having to fix broken hammers in pianos before he 
could perform 
the inner world was the only escape for me in the soviet 
union says viardo i lost friends because i did not participate 
in the political system i was broken spiritually but my music was 
really better after that because i used this pressure for artistic 
purposes 
in moscow he says when i felt very lonely i played a cycle 
of loneliness the schubert songs transcribed by liszt it was 
public loneliness on the stage 
then came the 1980s and soviet president mikhail gorbachevs 
policy of glasnost or openness viardo was allowed to travel 
abroad twice to play in western europe in the summer of 1987 and 
again in the summer of 1988 when he replaced an ailing soviet 
emigre pianist with the los angeles philharmonic at the hollywood 
bowl 
the big break came in the fall of 1988 when he was on a tour of 
europe south africa argentina and the united states he was 
offered an artistinresidence position at the university of north 
texas in denton 
his old friends from texas had never forgotten him visiting 
moscow repeatedly working to bring him back and as he traveled on 
a highway between dallas and fort worth a childs feeling 
induced him to stay 
the political structure in russia was changing and i thought 
this is the right moment viardo recalls i did not bring my 
music my books or even much underwear but i said why not 
he wrote a letter to the soviet ambassador in washington asking 
that his wife natasha be allowed to bring their children to the 
united states four nervous weeks later the soviets granted what he 
calls oral permission for his sons to leave the soviet union 
natasha viardo and sons philipp 12 and alexander 5 left 
moscow for new york on dec 11 gorbachev was to be in new york that 
day and viardo calculated that the soviets would not block his 
familys exit because they would not want to cause their leader any 
embarrassment

<TEXT>
the exit came off without a hitch though viardo notes that the 
soviets have never provided a written guarantee that his family can 
continue to stay outside the soviet union and keep their citizenship 
the us government also did not give the viardos free rein 
after viardo met with president ronald reagan and secretary of state 
george shultz the us government gave him a visa so he could teach 
at the university of north texas twice a month until 1990 
but viardo cannot travel beyond a 25mile radius of any american 
city and he must make a special request for every tour within the 
united states and he must reapply for his work permit each time he 
returns from abroad 
still he feels much more free with selfexpression in the west 
i felt myself getting rotten playing all the time with the same 
soviet orchestras 
the pianist says he wants his musicmaking to be bigger and 
higher up than the mechanics of the instrument 
i am not interested only in piano playingi have to be in 
love with piecesi am in love now with the second shostakovich 
sonata madly in love i feel that the open painful touches suit 
me 
in april viardo seduced the carnegie hall audience with a 
program of sonatas by domenico scarlatti rachmaninoffs corelli 
variations and debussys impressionistic preludes 
to end the program the pianist offered the american premiere of 
some theater music by the 20thcentury soviet composer dimitri 
shostakovich viardo played the bedbug like a broadway showman 
his fingers prancing on the keys with what he calls deadly humor 
and a wry smile but he says the general feeling of the program was 
of slowly sliding from the roof and struggling to keep yourself 
up not knowing if youll fall off 
the rachmaninoff and the scarlatti are united by a concealed 
pain he says the 19thcentury russian composers piece alludes 
to his impending death and the 18thcentury italian composer 
reflects on his unrequited love for a student 
rachmaninoff is for me nostalgic he went abroad after the 1917 
bolshevik revolution and suffered because he was not able to be in 
russia 
next season viardo is scheduled to return to the soviet union 
for concerts followed by an american tour with the moscow 
philharmonic but these dates were arranged before he brought his 
sons to the united states since then there have been no new offers 
of concerts in the soviet union 
viardo was born in the village of krasnaya polyana he received 
his first piano lessons at age 6 from his grandmother a former 
stalinist camp inmate who took care of him while his mother a 
pianist and singer was touring 
my mama told me ill throw you into the water like a puppy 
when she sent him to music school in moscow at the age of 14 at 
first he says he had little money he slept in railroad cars in a 
depot each night 
it didnt upset me not at all because lots of spiritual 
things were going on the greatest experience was to go to the 
conservatory he says 
he received a doctorate from the conservatory in 1975 and taught 
there until last year in may he performed at the school as part of 
a tour that included stops in france belgium and israel 
his success notwithstanding the move to the united states has 
not been an easy one i had a very heavy period in new york it 
was very hard with the psychological changesive become a 
different animal here he feels he must accelerate events make 
up for lost time 
although he has received rave reviews from american critics for 
his poised lyricism lucid tone and flashy pyrotechnics viardo 
admits he needs more concerts to build a fasttrack western career 
and viardo says he sometimes misses his moscow life and friends 
his dacha his five pianos and his native caucasian mountains 
ask him if he is happy and he will demur 
happiness in the russian interpretation is something you will 
never reach he says still he is happy to have a piano and a 
studio happy to have a contented family happy to travel and to 
meet people 
most of all i am always happy when i hear my colleagues 
playing well and playing from the heart and touching the sky i 
start to physically perspire to jump it makes me really out of my 
mind

editors note formed in upstate new york soon after the civil 
war the national grange of the patrons of husbandry became an 
agrarian movement that helped improve life in rural america through 
cooperative enterprise the grange hall also was the center of 
social activity in many a small town now the grange appears to be 
dying on the vine its membership dwindling and aging 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
here in the birthplace of the grange a 
recent regional meeting of the farmers organization grew boisterous 
when about 60 members showed up it reminded charles david fryer of 
the good old days 
thats the way it used to be when i joined says fryer 
grange no 1s master or chief presiding officer 
that was in the early 1950s a time when the local grange hall 
was the social center of many rural communities in america and the 
organization had 880000 members nationally the grange in those 
days was a prime force in the movement to modernize life outside 
the cities 
now the national grange for the patrons of husbandry which was 
formed in this picturesque town in western new york shortly after 
the civil war appears to be dying on the vine its membership 
dwindling and aging 
a typical bimonthly meeting of the fredonia chapter draws only 
about 10 to 20 members 
were down to 101 members says fryer noting that 15 years 
ago there were more than 300 weve lost a lot of members through 
death and weve had a lot of members drop out because theyve just 
lost interest 
the grange one of the first fraternal organizations to stress 
family membership and the participation of women as equals with men 
is now down to about 335000 members nationally 
our losses go along with other fraternal organizations says 
the granges national president robert barrow people are just 
not getting involved there are too many things going on in the 
community 
a lack of community activities in small towns helped fuel the 
granges growth after oliver hudson kelley and six others organized 
the first grange in 1868 by 1872 there were more than 1000 
chapters 
the grange was organized to help unite farmers from the north and 
south following the civil war and provide a family oriented 
fraternal organization to improve the economic and social position 
of the farm population 
the granges became political forums seeking to correct economic 
abuses through cooperative enterprise the organization pushed a 
legislative agenda that would chalk up some impressive successes 
rural electrification free rural mail delivery the federal highway 
system the granger laws regulating railroads and grain storage 
facilities established the constitutional principle of public 
regulation of private utilities 
but the grange hall also provided a variety of social activities 
dances dinners contests shows sales and games that made the 
meetings the place to be to have fun in many small communities 
grange member grace reifler recalls years ago you didnt have 
television to go out a couple of nights a month was a big event it 
was a social affair 
our grange was filled they were all filled said claire a 
63year member who asked that her last name not be used we had 
young people parents kids up to the age where they were old enough 
to join we used to have a good time 
change came after world war ii radio and then television 
provided inhouse entertainment young people began to desert the 
small towns for the big cities and the farm population began to 
decline 
a big blow to the grange came in the 1950s when it was no longer 
necessary to join in order to purchase lowcost insurance members 
who had joined specifically for the insurance left and grange 
membership began to fall 
in new york a large share of the 25000 members are senior 
citizens 
i would say more than half are over age 60 morse says 
were not taking in the age group we need now 
this helps create an image problem that granger blanche rice runs 
into when she talks with her grandchildren about joining 
you know what their answer is she says why would we want 
to hang around a bunch of old people 
linda kesby 39 says most of the 16 members in her grange in 
ellery ny are a great deal older and theyre having to decide 
what they want to do about the grange 
if they do join younger members often find many older members 
resistant to change and new ideas according to joe trask master of 
the grange in hamburg ny 
one grange got some younger people in and they got the idea 
they would make some money for the treasury by holding a square 
dance trask recalls the older members said wait a minute we 
just paid to have this floor refinished youre not going to scratch 
that floor with a square dance tunnel vision 
neva woolley deputy state master adds i think its a real 
problem you constantly hear well we dont do it this way weve 
always done it this way i think change is essential were in a 
changing world and you have to keep up with the times 
one change that barrow said had a 5050 chance of being 
implemented is a modification in the granges rituals which date 
back to its formation and which some younger members dont see as 
necessary some of it has to be brought up to modernday 
language he says 
most members arent against some ritual change but its not 
likely the grange will remove its prohibition against alcohol 
i dont think the members will ever change that barrow says 
grange leaders have organized a youth leadership program which 
has met with some success 
we went to a youth conference in february and there were over 
100 young grangers there under the age of 25 kesby says and 
they were very enthusiastic wanting to get the grange going more in 
their area 
the granges longstanding policy of letting other community 
organizations and groups use its local halls for their activities 
may also help draw in nonmembers such as gerri centenella 
she has been conducting fitness classes out of the fredonia hall 
and was attending the regional meeting with her husband 
they told me to just come and see what it was like she says 
after the meeting she said she was considering joining 
the odds seem long however that the grange will recover its old 
glory as one local leader put it unless changes are made to bring 
in younger members by the year 2010 well be extinct

the role that beautiful outgoing polly draper 
landed in abcs thirtysomething originally called for an 
overweight mousy frump 
the producers liked me and flew me out from new york for some 
tests as ellyn she says they said they loved me but they 
didnt think i was right for the role 
the tall svelte draper could never be called a frump and with a 
strong sometimes almost overwhelming personality shes hardly 
mousy 
in the beginning they saw ellyn as sort of on the pathetic 
side she says my personality is just too strong 
they changed the concept of the character because they realized 
there was more opportunity for growth then they began writing for 
me they knew i loved to do comedy so they wrote some humor in 
thirtysomething the socalled yuppie soap opera has 
just completed its second year on abc the drama created by 
marshall herskovitz and edward zwick has a strong following among 
young adults but overall its not strong in the ratings and wasnt 
in the top 30 shows for the season 
the series follows a group of young people coping with careers 
marriage children and contemporary life the characters seem to 
spend as much time moping as coping and the whine list on this 
show is strictly vintage 
the series also stars timothy busfield peter horton melanie 
mayron ken olin patricia wettig and mel harris 
draper was interviewed during a break in the filming although 
most shows are out of production at this time the producers 
scheduled three shows for next season in anticipation of an actors 
strike which never came to pass 
melanie mayron and i play the single girls and the show were 
doing is about computer dating she says we just cant meet the 
kind of men we want to meet which is flawless men ive just broken 
up with my boyfriend in the show ellyn also has an ulcer from her 
highpowered job as the head of some kind of program at city hall 
and from the strain of everything else 
draper was living in new york doing mostly theater when she 
auditioned for thirtysomething 
id never auditioned for a series before because if you did a 
series that meant you couldnt do movies she says i made a 
living acting i did some small parts in films i was almost getting 
good parts in movies and getting disappointed almost getting a role 
is the worst thing its like being runnerup in the miss america 
pageant 
i played marilyn monroe in a play in new york called 
insignificance believe it or not it took me two hours to get 
into makeup and costume i was shocked when i saw myself in the 
mirror 
draper was born in gary ind but grew up in palo alto calif 
i went to yale so i really feel like im from the east she 
says 
her father is an official with the united nations and her 
grandfather was gen william h draper jr one of the architects of 
the marshall plan 
the only thing i can remember about gary is that i was bitten 
by a hamster when i was 3 she says 
i sort of got into acting because in the eighth grade there was 
a boy i wanted to kiss id never really been kissed so i created 
this whole camelot play so he could play lancelot and i was 
guinevere but it didnt work out our noses kept getting in the 
way i didnt really know how to kiss on the way home i kept hoping 
the school bus would crash 
draper says that since then shes learned how to kiss and how to 
act 
im also single this year she says its frightening i 
separated from my husband were taking a vacation together 
however 
her husband is kevin wade who wrote the screenplay for working 
girl 
she and melanie mayron also did a layout for vogue magazine 
it took five hours just for the makeup and lighting she 
says both of us came away with a lot of beauty tips

more than four months after taking a detour from 
dance to star on broadway in a stage version of kafkas 
metamorphosis mikhail baryshnikov still calls his first theater 
experience scary 
it means going out there every night and speaking those first 
few words of dialogue says the man who has thrilled the world of 
western ballet ever since he defected from the soviet union in 
1974sometimes you have to push the sounds out of your throat 
baryshnikov has been fighting that fear eight times a week in 
metamorphosis steven berkoffs adaptation of franz kafkas 
short novel about a young man named gregor samsa who awakens one 
morning to find he has turned into an insect 
there is something about theater in general he says quietly 
you have to go out there and tell a story with words when people 
come to the ballet they expect you will dance 
baryshnikov sat in his dressing room in the metropolitan opera 
house where american ballet theater which he runs is rehearsing 
its summer season he was in the middle of a fiveweek break from 
metamorphosis to keep the ballet company up to performance level 
and star for one benefit performance in martha grahams ballet 
night journey 
now he has returned to the play which has reopened at the ethel 
barrymore theater for a limited run through july 15 
i didnt know what to expect because it was my first theater 
experience says baryshnikov who has already tried the movies 
with such films as the turning point and white nights i 
just pretty much went with stevens directions in a certain sense 
i tried to imitate him because he is a great mime when he 
rehearses he does all the parts not only gregor during the 
rehearsal i was pretty much amazed by his metamorphosis 
baryshnikov first saw the play last year in paris when roman 
polanski played the bug in a production also directed by berkoff 
the dancer calls polanski the godfather of metamorphosis on 
broadway 
i was very moved by his performance baryshnikov recalls 
he was quite wonderful we ended up just talking about theater in 
general he said if you are that interested in theater why dont 
you try it i think you will have a lot of fun with this role as i 
do 
several weeks later producer lars schmidt who bankrolled the 
paris production called baryshnikov and suggested he consider 
appearing in the show on broadway 
the play was first done at duke university in north carolina in 
february to give the dancer a chance to get used to his new role as 
actor not dancer and moved to new york the following month 
his portrait of gregor came from many sources he says 
i remembered certain things about polanskis performance 
baryshnikov says and there was also my humble ideas about this 
too those combinations worked together 
the dance superstar also learned a great deal by watching other 
actors particularly rene auberjonois laura esterman and madeleine 
potter who play his father mother and sister in the show 
i saw what kind of choices they made in the daytoday 
rehearsals and from performance to performance baryshnikov says 
there are endless possibilities of interpretation but i wasnt 
sure how free i could be in this material 
berkoff an english playwright and actor wrote metamorphosis 
in the late 1960s and since then has directed nearly a dozen 
productions of it around the world the broadway set resembles a 
giant spider an iron jungle gym from which baryshnikov hangs or 
scurries about on all fours 
the movement was a collaboration between myself and steven but 
a lot of it was pretty much set particularly the main positions and 
what to do with my arms baryshnikov says but steven said that 
everyone adds a slightly different quality to the choreography of 
it 
the performer knew a lot of kafkas works particularly the 
trial and his diaries 
a lot of gregor is in kafkas life he says the role is 
very much kafkas thoughts about his relationship with his family 
and the way he felt about them 
the vocal aspect of the role was the most difficult for him to 
prepare baryshnikov began taking voice lessons last fall with a 
voice teacher at the juilliard school 
i first learned english from the streets and from television 
he says i imitated it phonetically when i speak russian i speak 
with a much deeper voice because it is more natural for me the 
teacher from juilliard taught me how to breathe on stage and not 
choke myself 
but is there a bit of baryshnikov in gregor too 
in any role whether you are a dancer or a singer or an actor 
there is a part of you a part of your experience as a human being 
a part of your past the way you have been brought up he says 
your life experience reflects through any role 
metamorphosis has opened the door to new stage and film 
offers but he hasnt committed himself to any just yet 
i might try to wear too many hats he says there are a few 
roads i can take 
i would like to rest think read travel and spend more time 
with my daughter says baryshnikov referring to his 8yearold 
daughter shura who lives with her mother actress jessica lange 
in the last few years ive had to make a lot of decisions without 
the full understanding of what im getting into there was no time 
for thinking 
his days still begin with early morning dance classes whether he 
is appearing in metamorphosis or not 
how will he know when to stop dancing 
i will know pretty much and it will be my decision but i have 
some good friends who will say to me get off the stage 
i am slowing down adds the 41yearold star if im 
dancing i want to learn something new like martha grahams night 
journey i am not interested anymore just to dance for dances 
sake particularly roles which i have been doing for many years 
when life is passing by you really have to do something new all the 
time 
end adv for sunday june 25

one of the three nations seized by communist 
forces in the indochina war cambodia plummeted into even greater 
turmoil and death in what was supposed to an era of reconstruction 
an ap correspondent who has kept watch on cambodia from thailand in 
all those years finds things are beginning to change now for 
cambodians 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no more revolution a communist 
government official shouted over the din of live american rock 
music and no more curfew we can dance until morning 
such euphoria is strikingly new in cambodia and so is the fact 
that anyone would express it so openly to a visiting western 
journalist just a few months ago it would have been politically 
dangerous to do so and dancing until dawn would have been 
impossible because of a decadelong curfew that had closed down the 
cambodian capital at night 
but 1989 brought a series of major reforms along with efforts to 
end a civil war with antigovernment guerrillas that have changed 
the rules and the mood in cambodia which has been under the rule of 
various communist factions since the end of the indochina war in 
1975 
a hunger for consumer goods a mini construction boom and dancing 
fever at phnom penhs growing number of nightclubs appear to be 
symptoms of hope that cambodias long agony is nearly over 
the freer speech seems to reflect a shift to liberalism among the 
motley mix of revolutionaries and technocrats who have run the 
country since the vietnamese invaded 10 years ago and ousted the 
khmer rouge faction that had turned the country into a killing 
ground where perhaps a million people were killed or died of 
governmentimposed hardship 
these days phnom penhs central market originally planned for 
state ownership is a haggling colorful and prospering arena of 
free enterprise along ok nha sou st thousands of motorbikes that 
failed road inspection tests in singapore have been shipped in 
repaired and snapped up by customers paying as much as 600 in gold 
a marked improvement is evident in residential buildings the 
result said vice mayor roth sarin of a recent ordinance allowing 
private ownership of property in a city which has grown from a ghost 
town at the end of the khmer rouge era to 300000 people in 1981 and 
nearly a million today 
led by the 38yearold prime minister hun sen the marxist 
government has also given farmers ownership of their land declared 
buddhism the state religion and abolished the death penalty it has 
promised to allow opposition political parties something 
neighboring vietnam and most other communist countries still reject 
if we the communist party lose in general elections we will 
be ready to step aside we are ready to play the democratic game 
newspaper editor khieu khanharith said in an interview how can 
one party pretend to represent all strata of society how can a 
leninist party represent buddhist monks 
government officials say the impetus for change comes from many 
quarters 
the phnom penh government hopes its liberal posture will woo back 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk cambodias leader until 
he was overthrown by prowest cambodians in 1970 the return of 
sihanouk would likely gain cambodia both international recognition 
and badly needed foreign aid and at the same time weaken the khmer 
rouge with whom sihanouk is linked in an antigovernment guerrilla 
alliance 
with vietnam promising to pull all its troops out of cambodia by 
sept 30 the phnom penh leaders will need determined support from 
the population to face the still potent khmer rouge and their 
leader pol pot who led the postwar reign of terror 
communism hun sen has said does not go well with most 
cambodians but liberal reforms do 
the communist world too officials point out is changing and 
warweary cambodia needs urgently to end its isolation and poverty 
by being flexibile 
if you stand up stubbornly to a strong wind you will be blown 
over foreign ministry spokesman chum bun rong said 
the cambodian problem is 70 percent solved declared another 
foreign ministry official echoing what some western residents here 
believe is overoptimism about the future many cambodians say they 
are elated that sihanouk might return to phnom penh and they paint a 
rosy picture of economic prosperity just around the corner 
but the peace process depends on the potentially explosive 
chemistry of several parties including the changeable sihanouk the 
hardline khmer rouge and its chinese armorers regarded as the most 
powerful group opposing the vietnamesebacked phnom penh government 
the khmer rouge has been eerily quiet on the battlefields but 
sihanouk recently predicted they would launch a major offensive this 
fall 
people are enthusiastic about the changes hun sen is bringing 
but were still dead scared of the khmer rouge said one 
businessman reflecting the deep scars the khmer rouge inflicted 
during its 197579 rule 
economically too there are major hurdles ahead 
among the worlds poorest nations the half war half peace 
of the past decade has prevented a regeneration of the countrys 
shattered infrastructure hul lim a senior official of the planning 
ministry projected that it will take cambodia until the year 2000 
to reach the level of per capita output of goods and services it had 
attained in 1970 
in another interview uy sambath of the commerce ministry listed 
the countrys 1988 exports as 30 million with imports totaling 
125 million the economy survives he said on credits from the 
soviet union barter trade and unofficial crossborder trade 
exchanges with thailand 
but many here are convinced the economy some 60 to 70 percent 
of it already in private hands is slowly improving a 
psychological boost is provided by the growing number of western aid 
agencies setting up offices in phnom penh and businessmen from 
japan singapore hong kong and thailand coming to survey investment 
possibilities 
anticipating the arrival of foreign companies and the higher 
salaries they will offer thousands of people are taking english 
lessons in private homes in an area now being called the english 
quarter 
the loosening of restrictions also has led to more ostentatious 
displays of wealth phnom penhs moneyed class can now buy american 
cosmetics french champagne thai beer and perhaps even a small 
japanese car lavish wedding parties a prime status symbol average 
200000 riel 1300 a sum far out of reach of the average 
cambodian 
life affords few luxuries in the countryside but chea kong a 
vice director in the agriculture ministry said the once dangerous 
deficits of rice have been brought down to this years manageable 
shortage of 50000 tons more construction is also evident in rural 
areas where contrary to guerrilla claims most western aid workers 
say the government has established considerable authority 
i see lethargy negligence lack of initiative stupid 
bureaucracy said one senior international aid official but at 
the same time i am amazed at what they have achieved in 10 years 
given their start from zero and their ostracism by the international 
community nothing works well here but it works

a dedicated communist who lost an eye 
fighting for the khmer rouge in the indochina war prime minister 
hun sen has emerged as a key figure in resolving cambodias civil 
war 
once dismissed by the west as a puppet of the vietnamese hun sen 
is preparing to run a country that vietnam promises will be free of 
all its troops by sept 30 
in the meantime he has stepped up negotiations with cambodian 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk and others to end a 
guerrilla war that is sapping the countrys limited resources and 
energy 
one of worlds youngest government heads the 38yearold hun sen 
has impressed diplomats and western aid officials in phnom penh 
he began as a country boy now hes by far the most 
intelligent of the lot said a senior soviet diplomat in phnom 
penh 
when this correspondent first interviewed hun sen in 1980 his 
responses were straight down the marxist line and he appeared to 
have a poor grasp of issues 
the hun sen of today is said to have picked up an impressive 
range of knowledge through latenight study foreign trips and daily 
staff briefings aides say he is progressing well in the english 
french and vietnamese languages 
he has also picked up on politicking driving his own car to 
villages listening to farmers grievances and berating ineffective 
officials on frequent inspection tours he takes time out to play 
soccer and volleyball on civil service teams 
hun sen may well be preparing for an election or at least a 
popularity contest with sihanouk who said in may he might return to 
phnom penh 
the prime minister appears to realize that he himself is 
handicapped 
despite his association with the hated khmer rouge sihanouk 
still commands widespread affection especially among older 
cambodians he remains a father figure who presided over an era of 
peace before his ouster by prowest cambodians in 1970 and the 
apocalyptic events that precipitated 
hun sen on the other hand fought with the khmer rouge in the 
war against usbacked cambodians and remains a communist in a land 
where the ideology was implemented with extreme brutality 
he has said however that communist ideology doesnt sit well 
with most cambodians 
thus hun sen has been the key proponent of economic and 
political liberalization and western aid officials say he gets 
things done in a government rife with inefficiency and corruption 
he has maintained a clean image and appears to live modestly 
hun sens formal education stopped after high school when he 
joined communist rebels fighting the phnom penh government some 
western historians say he fled in 1967 but recently he reportedly 
told sihanouk that he joined the guerrillas in 1970 because the 
prince himself had sided with the khmer rouge and had called for a 
war against the usbacked government in phnom penh 
the official biography says hun sen was born in the northeastern 
province of kompong cham he rose rapidly in khmer rouge ranks to 
command a division and during an was wounded five times losing an 
eye to an artillery shell april 16 1975 during an attack on a 
government camp in his native province 
a day later the khmer rouge entered phnom penh to end the war and 
begin a reign of terror how far if at all hun sen participated in 
khmer rouge atrocities is not known 
phnom penh officials play up his early opposition to the the 
khmer rouge leadership and his defection in 1977 when he and a 
number of other commanders fled to the vietnamese 
in january 1979 the vietnamese entered phnom penh and hun sen 
came out of the jungles to become the youngest and perhaps most 
inexperienced foreign minister in the world in january 1985 he 
was named chairman of the council of ministers or prime minister 
of cambodia

this is a town that surrendered its name 
to a deadly disease and signaled to the world what unchecked 
industrial waste can do to humans wildlife and their surroundings 
more than 800 of its citizens paid the price in death and 
thousands more have been left painfully crippled 
in the beginning people were left puzzled by the scourge wrought 
by a chemical companys indiscriminate dumping of mercury into 
minamata bay 
it was 1950 and they saw fish floating belly up birds dropping 
into the sea and cats dancing in wild death convulsions 
then in 1956 they themselves began to feel it hands and feet 
going numb tunnel vision a loss of coordination and balance 
chronic pain convulsions and in many cases death 
until then minamata had been a bustling fishing and factory town 
nestled between lush green rice paddies and orange groves in far 
southwestern japan the clear blue waters of its scenic harbor 
yielded abundant seafood 
shinobu sakamoto and her older sister mayumi were among the 
first to become victims of what much later would be called minamata 
disease 
mayumi died in 1956 at age 5 
shinobu who was born in 1956 was poisoned while in her mothers 
womb she is one of some 60 second generation victims born with 
severe defects 
some evenings shinobu wanders into the soushisha a cooperative 
set up to help poisoning victims to visit watch television and 
sometimes to spend the night in the large strawmat room where 
visitors stay 
she speaks and walks with difficulty but is cheerful 
the poisoning in minamata was caused by mercuryladen water 
discharged by a factory owned by the chemical company chisso corp 
the pollution devastated the town 
its population which was 50000 in 1956 has dropped to 36000 
and continues to fall while the number of poisonrelated deaths has 
climbed to 871 by local count 
all told about 200000 people in minamata and its surrounding 
villages on the southwestern island of kyushu were affected in one 
way or another by the poisoning 
the factory that polluted minamatas harbor once employed 5000 
people it now hires only 700 many of its buldings stand empty in 
the fenced chisso compound grim monuments to a disaster 
minamatas victims and their supporters speak of their tragedy as 
a classic case of the high cost of japans industrialization 
people just care about money and what it buys said takanori 
goto a tokyo lawyer who has represented some of the victims in 
court theyre not concerned about the victims created by 
industrial prosperity minamata is a typical example 
chisso corp whose acetaldehydeprocessing factory began dumping 
an estimated total of 27 tons of mercury into minamata bay in 1932 
denied responsibility for the pollution which continued until 1968 
minamata and several other severe outbreaks of industrial 
poisoning led the government to establish an environment agency in 
1970 but the victims have faced lengthy court battles to gain 
compensation for their suffering 
as the victims grow older the average age of first generation 
victims is 60 they continue their battles in court and also 
negotiate with chisso which is has paid so much in compensation 
that it is basically insolvent lawyer goto said 
of the 12296 people who have applied for official designation as 
minamata disease victims the health and welfare ministry has 
granted only 2210 the official recognition that would provide them 
with compensation welfare assistance and medical care 
we believe at least 10 to 20 percent of the 200000 people 
living in the affected area have symptoms of the poisoning said 
teruo kawamoto 57 a minamata disease victim who has led battles 
with chisso for more than 20 years

kawamoto and other victims have asked the united nations to 
recognize violations of their human rights and to enforce a new 
international standard for mercury pollution of 16 parts per million 
in japan which still adheres to the previous standard of 25 parts 
per million 
members of the soushisha cooperative which has a small 
laboratory to test for mercury content say the deadly metal has 
drifted farther out to sea and continues to contaminate fish 
officially considered safe 
with government assistance the company has been ordered to pay 
more than 100 million to victims in compensation in addition to 
medical costs 
it was also ordered in 1973 to clean up minamata bay chisso has 
dredged much of the harbor it is still in the process of filling in 
the harbor at a cost of over more than 290 million 
in 1987 a court found the government guilty of failing to prevent 
the poisonings by allowing fishing to continue in the vicinity and 
ordered it to pay 115 victims a total 46 million 
in 1988 two former senior executives of chisso were found guilty 
of criminal negligence for failing to stop the pollution between 
july 1958 and june 1968 despite health and welfare ministry 
warnings the men both elderly received suspended jail sentences 
although people started falling ill in 1956 it wasnt until 1959 
that it was determined that a diet heavy in mercurycontaminated 
seafood caused the poisoning 
but fishermen dependent on the sea for their livelihood 
continued to take fish from the bay 
the controversy over chissos responsibility created a deep 
social rift in minamata between families of victims and nonvictims 
most but not all of the poisoning victims were families of 
farmers or fishermen 
many of the nonvictims were families of employees of chisso 
corp who feared for their jobs if they protested the mercury 
dumping 
in 1972 the photographer w eugene smith was beaten by chisso 
employees as he took pictures of protests by victims he later 
published an awardwinning photo essay and a book on the minamata 
tragedy 
twenty years ago people told us to get out and made fun of 
victims said kawamoto he added that he received hate mail from 
people who called the victims cockroaches and said they should 
just die 
said lawyer goto people thought it was a contagious epidemic 
or in typical japanese fashion they blamed the victims for having 
evil hearts or said they were suffering for their ancestors 
wrongdoing 
cases continue to crop up but many remain hidden because 
symptoms can be light and because many people still fear the stigma 
of minamata disease they dont tell their doctors whats really 
wrong said ken takakura one of the 22 young activists in the 
cooperative 
for many minamata residents the question now is how to 
revitalize the economy of a town notorious for pollution and ill 
health takakura added 
the cooperative has helped local residents shift from fishing to 
growing oranges and it markets the fruit in tokyo it also runs a 
resource center a farm and a museum to educate japanese about the 
minamata tragedy 
town officials are promoting minamatas tourism potential and 
people living here say the deep rift between families of victims and 
nonvictims has begun to heal 
so many families have suffered that its hard to be hateful 
now takakura said

with a 112billion foreign debt 1000 percent 
and economic stagnation brazil is unable to keep up with its needs 
for public health care and people are dying needlessly says one 
medical official this is one of a series of periodic reports by the 
associated press on the economic social and political turbulence 
that has turned south america into a continent in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a critically ailing economy and a 
failure to allot funds have crippled brazils health care system 
public hospitals are unable to give proper care to patients they 
admit and often are forced to turn away the sick and injured for 
lack of staff beds medicines money and equipment even in 
emergency cases 
many deaths one official says thousands have been attributed 
to the crisis 
at the same time diseases long under control elsewhere in the 
world tuberculosis yellow fever polio and malaria have made 
their way back to brazil according to the united nationsaffiliated 
world health organization 
in addition waves of strikes by doctors nurses and workers for 
better pay further hobble a system that was never at its best to 
begin with public health doctors earn the equivalent of only 130 a 
month 
we are in the midst of an unprecedented health care crisis that 
is causing the needless deaths of thousands of brazilians said 
dr laerte andrade vaz de mello president of rio de janeiro states 
regional medical council 
brazil the worlds seventh largest industrial power has one of 
the worlds highest infant mortality rates and ranks third worldwide 
in the number of aids cases 
parasitic diseases are rampant malnutrition is common 
public hospitals are overcrowded understaffed illequipped and 
poorly stocked doctors nurses and staff are on strike more than 
half the working year public hospitals in major cities lack 
ambulances to reach outlying slum districts where the poor live 
some examples of tragic cases as turned up in state and city 
medical investigations 
doctors in brazils largest emergency center in rio de janeiro 
turned away a 19yearold motorcyclecrash victim with a skull 
fracture because all of its 12 operating rooms were in use and not 
enough doctors were on duty at the time anyway two hours later the 
victim died according to rio de janeiros municipal medical council 
seven overcrowded rio hospitals refused to admit a man suffering 
from a severe concussion for lack of room fourteen hours later the 
man slipped into a coma and died en route to an eighth hospital the 
rio state medical council said 
in sao paulo the wife of a former congressman benedito cintra 
in need of an emergency caesarean section died because the only 
anesthesiologist on duty was involved in an operation on another 
floor and could not get to her in time 
the government tottering under a 112 billion foreign debt 
1000 percent annual inflation and negative economic growth 
contributes just 4 percent of overall revenue to health care 
its frightening dr ana maria litke secretary general of 
brazils national medical council told the ap but life just 
isnt worth that much here 
further straining the health care system is the mass of people 
who have poured into city slums from the impoverished countryside 
meanwhile eight government ministries squabble over authority to 
grant funds for health care to states and cities delays sometimes 
as long as three months often cause hospital strikes and shutdowns 
by the time money trickles down to the city level little is 
usually left said antonio de carvalho rios deputy health 
secretary 
still brazil spent billions of dollars in the 1970s to become a 
world exporter of specialized hospital technology 
our priorities are out of whack said dr sergio arouca 
president of the national doctors union were building hospitals 
in other countries and our own doctors are being paid bluecollar 
wages 
public health doctors are forced to moonlight as truck drivers 
and policemen nurses take home less than 64 a month the minimum 
wage and many supplement their wages by selling homemade items in 
street markets 
recently doctors nurses and staff workers in rio de janeiro 
went on a fivemonth strike paralyzing city hospitals 
in one incident health officials asked gov wellington moreira 
franco to cancel the worldfamous prelent carnival in rio de 
janeiro because not enough doctors or staff would be available to 
handle the increased number of injuries that occur over the fourday 
period only then did the government rush in 5 million in emergency 
relief to staff emergency wards 
in march federal hospitals in brasilia the capital cancelled a 
third of their surgery cases because of a shortage of linens and 
blankets at the same time in sao paulo the nations largest city 
and main medical center more than 90 percent of private hospitals 
shut down during a strike 
even rio de janeiros national cancer institute the nations top 
public institution closed six of 10 operating rooms because of a 
40day delay in government funding 
shortages of medical supplies lead to rationing hoarding and in 
some cases black marketing 
unscrupulous private dealers often buy blood from beggars and 
prostitutes and resell it at a profit without testing for aids or 
other diseases more than 60 percent of about 6 million transfusions 
done each year involve untested blood according to the health 
ministry 
even human organs are for sale although it is illegal 
classified ads appear daily in newspapers for corneas kidneys and 
livers 
proponents of health care reform are pushing congress for a 
single health ministry to administer funds regionalized health 
networks a national health care fund reequipping of hospitals 
and construction of clinics in remote rural areas 
brazils new constitution approved by congress in october 
guarantees this type of health care reform said jose noronha 
health secretary of rio de janeiro state 
but reform would mean cutting thousands of workers from the 
government payroll a touchy issue most politicans would rather 
avoid with a presidential election set for november 
were up against a wall of civil servants who wont be happy to 
lose their jobs noronha said 
the national outcry has produced a flurry of political squabbles 
but little action most health officials blame the inactivity on 
savage individualism and moral decadence they maintain is 
running deep through the country 
brazilians are solely out for themselves said dr valdir 
cuna goncalves a respected cancer specialist why expect the 
governments attitude to be any different 
but some like dr litke of the national health council remain 
optimistic 
brazil has the capacity to resurrect its health care system 
she said its a matter of when people decide theyve had enough 
suffering

uncontrolled settlement in brazils 
amazon rain forest has led to an alarming spread of a centuriesold 
scourge of the tropics malaria 
as hundreds of thousands of prospectors farmers and adventurers 
poured into brazils vast northern wilderness in the past decade 
many fell victim to the mosquitoborne disease 
last year the health ministry registered 560000 cases of 
malaria in brazil up from 500000 a year before the number is 
expected to rise again this year 
to control the outbreak the health ministry plans a massive 
spraying campaign with ddt an insecticide banned in many countries 
only shock treatment can contain the spread of malaria in 
amazonia dr agostinho cruz marquez head of the health 
ministrys malaria division said in an interview 
malaria is almost exclusively a problem of amazonia a 2 million 
squaremile wilderness sprawled across northern and western brazil 
of the 560000 cases last year 97 percent were in the amazon states 
of amazonas para rondonia and acre 
the worst affected is rondonia a state the size of oregon on 
brazils western border with bolivia and notorious for the 
destruction of its rain forest rondonia had 42 percent of the 
countrys malaria cases with 192 deaths in the first eight months of 
1988 
the goldmining town of ariquemes in rondonia has become the 
world capital of malaria cruz marquez said 
the military government that ruled from 1964 to 1985 urged poor 
brazilians to settle in the undeveloped amazon using slogans such 
as the brave march to the west since the drive began in the 
1970s the incidence of malaria has risen more than 500 percent 
malaria causes fever and chills and a gradual debilitation of the 
body it can be fatal if not treated in brazil 1 to 2 percent of 
those who get the disease die from it cruz marquez said 
although quininebased drugs can cure malaria in 24 hours the 
government cannot get the medicine to all who need it throughout the 
vast and often inaccessible wilderness he added 
the federation of miners says an estimated 3000 mining sites in 
amazonia have drawn untold thousands of prospectors shopkeepers 
pilots and prostitutes to remote areas often the only access is by 
helicopter or small planes which land on dirt strips 
to attend to this population the governments public health 
campaign department has just 300 laboratories cruz marquez said 
adding that in some mining sites a swedishmade malaria drug called 
larian that enters the country as contraband is sold literally for 
the price of gold 
now he said the government plans to send 70000 army soldiers 
to the region to begin the antimalaria campaign 
cruz marquez said ddt would be used because of its low cost and 
effectiveness against the marlariacarrying anopheles mosquito 
the insecticide will not be used indiscriminately but only to 
spray inside the huts and leantos used by miners and settlers he 
said 
the fiveyear campaign will cost 198 million and will be paid 
for in part with loans from the world bank cruz marquez said 
malaria is the only thing that scares a prospector he said 
in a way its a giant shield of defense for the amazon

on the book jacket of her new novel the temple 
of my familiar alice walker calls the work a romance of the 
past 500000 years 
i mean romance not in the modern sense but in the archaic 
sense the author said in a recent interview the archaic 
meaning is wisdom tale in a wisdom tale each character develops 
goes to a new level of understanding 
as for the time frame she said i was going back many many 
many many many years and 500000 seemed to cover it 
the temple of my familiar harcourt brace jovanovich 1995 
does indeed go back many many many years miss lissie one of the 
books main characters recounts tales of her past lives going all 
the way back to the dawn of civilization 
this book already on bestseller lists despite largely negative 
reviews is walkers first novel since the pulitzer prizewinning 
the color purple was published in 1982 there is such a 
demarcation in style between the two works that the temple of my 
familiar is bound to disappoint some fans who fell in love with 
the longsuffering celie flamboyant shug avery and other purple 
characters miss celie and miss shug make cameo appearances in 
temple in remembrances by the character fanny who is celies 
granddaughter 
whereas the color purple was an epistolary novel told 
through celies eyes and rendered in stark realism the temple of 
my familiar might be called a new age novel 
many of its characters carlotta a south american refugee 
arveyda a hugely popular rock star fanny a college professor 
turned masseuse and suwelo a male chauvinist who gets 
rehabilitated are more like archetypes than fullblown characters 
and they all speak the touchyfeely language of 
consciousnessraising conversations arent at all realistic and 
its hard to follow whos talking since they all sound alike 
miss lissie the sweet old lady who goes timetripping and her 
companion hal are by far walkers most successful characters 
because they have been given such individual and idiosyncratic 
voices 
many of miss lissies dream memories as she calls them directly 
contradict history as it is presented in judeogrecoroman 
scholarship 
walker a petite woman who speaks with a soft voice showing no 
hint of uncertainty calls the myths recounted in her book my 
world view its how it is for me people will obviously have their 
own world view 
some of these dream memories seem a little simplistic others are 
preachy but one the dream that gives the book its title stands 
out for its beauty and ethereal quality 
in the story lissie is an indian woman showing a white man her 
temple her familiar or pet a creature that is part bird part 
fish and part reptile is scurrying around while she speaks which 
she finds distracting she tries to confine the familiar by putting 
a series of bowls over it each increasingly larger but each time 
the beautiful creature breaks out after the third escape she 
realizes she has betrayed her familiar and lost something quite 
precious 
walker said the tale came to her in a dream 
i had been trying to think with my conscious mind about why 
people give over their spirituality to organized religion when in 
fact you dont really need an intermediary to be connected to the 
universe everybody has that innately she said i was sort of 
stuck i couldnt figure it out 
i started needing to paint with two colors turquoise and 
coral i painted my bed turquoise and my ceiling coral then the 
colors which i had been really sort of dreaming about wanting to 
use unlocked this dream that is the explanation which is that we 
become distracted by the structure we become distracted by 
organized religions trappings we like the church we like the 
synagogue we like the mosque and all the rituals but we have 
become so distracted by these that the familiar which is our 
spirit the natural untamed spirit just gets really you try to 
imprison it so that while youre looking at your temple its gone 
because its temple is freedom 
the temple of my familiar is walkers 12th book originally 
from georgia where the color purple was set the 45yearold 
novelist poet and essayist now lives in a small town outside san 
francisco where she spends her time writing reading and 
meditating she mentioned pointedly that she does not watch 
television a trait she shares with her character miss lissie 
i think television has pretty much killed off the storytelling 
rituals the real knowledge is not getting passed on walker said 
the temple of my familiar is not a conventional narrative 
novel and shouldnt be judged as such walker is asked how she would 
like readers to read her book 
i just want them to relax that would be the first thing she 
said take a deep breath it would be great if they meditated 
then i think they would really get to another level and just assume 
that this is something thats meant to be a gift from me and enjoy 
it

jimmy bowen doesnt sing well and can 
barely read music 
but in a career spanning four decades the 51yearold bowen has 
been a record producer for pop stars such as frank sinatra and dean 
martin and such country stars as hank williams jr and reba 
mcentire 
in the past 12 years he has headed four nashville record 
divisions at one time or another right now he heads mcas nashville 
office and is president of the new universal records under the mca 
corporate umbrella 
in the spacious den of his plantationstyle home sits a brightly 
colored juke box containing 100 carefully selected songs theyre 
hits bowen has been associated with in some fashion 
i dont have time to play it a lot says bowen who works an 
average 90 hours a week 
even when not at work he is consumed by music the huge 
television screen in his den is often playing mtv he listens to a 
radio or cassette player when he takes a bath he listens to music 
on the radio next to his bed and in his car on the way to his music 
row office and recording studio 
much of his career has been in producing records directing the 
recording sessions helping choose the songs and mixing the vocals 
and instrumentation into the final product 
in 1987 alone bowen was the record producer on 11 no 1 hit 
singles and three no 1 albums he has been the producer for 
williams for nine years covering 11 albums 
i think i was born with a real good ear for music in general 
he said in an interview i like all kinds of music if its done 
well ive worked in many different kinds of music and enjoyed it 
thirty years ago he used to play bass guitar but today he says 
all i can do is stay in key of a as for his singing bowen 
says im about a quarter tone flat 
while working in los angeles in the mid1960s bowen was the 
record producer for sinatra on hits such as strangers in the 
night and thats life 
i never worked with anyone who phrased better than frank 
sinatra he recalled his breathing and phrasing were 
incredible he was an incredible professional he was always 
straight to the point and he was a good human being i really liked 
him and liked working with him 
with martin bowen was involved in two dozen hit singles and five 
albums that sold at least 1 million copies each one of the tunes 
was everybody loves somebody sometime martins signature song 
he was the most unique laidback artist i ever worked with 
he said 
bowens comments on current singers under his direction 
reba mcentire with all those vocal gymnastics reminds me of 
ella fitzgerald and dinah washington people who did great vocal 
gymnastics and still sold the message of the song 
hank williams jr is the best writerartist ive ever worked 
with twenty years from now he will be known as a great writer like 
his father is right now hes such a great artist that people 
arent aware of what a great writer he is 
george strait is so much like dean martin its a time warp 
for me everything is just so easy for them there is no stress and 
results just happen naturally george could have been a big band 
singer if thats the era we were living in thats what he would 
have done 
bowen who was raised in dumas texas broke into the music 
business by playing bass guitar in a band with rock n roll pioneer 
buddy knox he cowrote knoxs hit record in 1957 party doll 
he got into production work in los angeles in the 60s then 
moved to nashville in the mid70s and concentrated his vast musical 
talents on country artists

marion gena rowlands is a successful college professor 
financially secure wellmarried cultured and elegant she also is 
miserable though at the start of woody allens another woman 
she is not aware that she is 
she is so separated from her feelings she is awakened only by the 
mournful talk of hope mia farrow to her therapist heard through a 
heating vent in marions office 
what marion says she needs in order to work on her book could 
also be what she needs to maintain her balance in the life she has 
created it requires that i really shut myself off from everything 
but the work 
hopes sadness forces marion to confront her own passionless 
life and the possibilities for passion she rejected again and 
again primarily when she married ken ian holm and rejected kens 
best friend larry gene hackman 
the cast is terrific and another woman is affecting despite 
allens tiresome focus on the neuroses of educated white

picasso trigger warner home video vhsbeta 7995 rated r 
 
a movie that combines charlies angels and james bond cant 
be all bad but it cant be all good either picasso trigger 
features about a half dozen angels and hunks with bare chests some 
sex and lots of mayhem done with all sorts of neat goodies including 
a rocketlaunching crutch 
it has a thin plot involving a drug lords revenge against a 
bunch of federal agents the angels and hunks who wipeout the 
gang 
actually the plot is no thinner than that of the late tv show or 
some of the bond movies however the script by andy sidaris who 
also directed is so bad that not even fastpaced action pretty 
scenery and clever electronics such as exploding toy cars and planes 
can not make up for it 
there is a cute but obvious twist at the end which if the viewer 
is paying attention to the story rather than the bodies can be 
predicted very early 
in case you miss it because of the scenery heres a brief 
rundown 
the film gets its name from a painting of a fish done in the 
style of the famous artist its presented at a party given by a 
drug rackets kingpin 
but just after the presentation the kingpin is rubbed out or 
was he not to worry he gets his again when the rocket launched 
from a crutch homes in on his pacemaker and kaboom 
the movie stars donna speir hope marie carlton steve bond and 
harold diamond yeah right you really know these actors but

big daddy polygram john cougar mellencamp 
 
after taking giant steps forward with his last two albums john 
cougar mellencamp consolidates his success with the deceptively 
impressive big daddy 
the onceridiculed johnny cougar set aside the snickers with 
1985s hardrocking scarecrow blending party tunes with pointed 
commentary about the american midwest the lonesome jubilee was 
musically adventurous with mellencamp adding a fiddle accordion 
and female singers to his basic rock combo 
big daddy sounds far less ambitious a collection of songs 
rather than a statement but in doing so mellencamp affirms his own 
maturation and the strengths of the band he has assembled 
mellencamp and his band sing and play with an understated warmth 
at times johns talking as much as singing and he never finds it 
necessary to shout on songs such as mansions in heaven his 
band only hints at the power it can unleash the players sound 
confident in their abilities not straightjacketed by the songs 
lately hes taken woody guthrie and bob dylan as role models 
championing the causes of societys underdogs jackie brown is 
an elegant folk ballad about a poor mans life and death in the 
countryside in martha say he sympathizes with a womans 
struggle for independence country gentleman is a scorching 
indictment of former president reagan and his rich friends 
the singers own aging is another constant theme mellencamp 
holds daughters teddi jo and justice in album cover photos 
about his only clear misstep is the single pop singer a 
slight song in which mellencamp insists he never wanted to be a pop 
star well why not his own career contradicts that notion as well 
as the myth that a pop singer cant make real statements on causes 
that mean something to him 
with his work on big daddy mellencamp solidifies his 
position alongside bruce springsteen and tom petty as one of the 
three best american rock band leaders in the 1980s

looking back on the ups downs and excesses of 
his 60year career as an entertainer sammy davis jr comments 
im probably the only man who was dr franenstein and the 
monster 
a 60year anniversary he started hoofing onstage at the age of 
3 is cause for retrospection and davis was in a reflective mood 
he also has a new autobiography why me farrar straus 
giroux 1895 an update of his 1965 memoir yes i can he 
talked openly about his years of excess as he sat at the bar of his 
holmby hills home uncharacteristically he was nursing a soft drink 
i created my own monster he said nobody put a gun to my 
head and said you have to go over the top so i had to deal with 
it once i had created this thing i didnt like who i was 
i didnt realize it at the time and it took a bunch of years 
of selfanalysis ive never gone to a shrink im not proud of 
that statement but there were no places for me to go there was no 
betty fords or this or that i had to do it myself 
i miss booze he admitted there aint no sense of me 
lying bourbon and coke oh man please a bloody mary on the 
plane that was it i would get on the plane and before it took off 
i had two bloody marys or two salty dogs man im ready it can 
crash now i dont care 
i always had to have the sip before i walked on the stage that 
was my reinforcement i used to watch the guys go to the bathroom 
not knowing they were going for a hit i never did that id just 
say bartender may i have some more of this 
davis quit drinking a dozen years ago because of cirrhosis of the 
liver he told of sitting on a hospital bed while his doctor 
prepared to drain his bloated belly if it comes out cloudy 
thats it the bells rung said the doctor he watched 
breathlessly and saw that the fluid was clear 
but by the time he kicked the booze his career was on the skids 
i had messed up so much in vegas and tahoe and other places that 
it was hard to get the bookings he recalled 
his salary was cut because of his unreliability id get on the 
stage and i didnt know whether i did 40 minutes or an hour and 40 
after the boozing stopped he played the las vegas desert inn for 
four weeks with a full orchestra the trade realized that sammy 
davis jr was back 
his career may have been repaired but his finances were not one 
day internal revenue service agents arrived at the davis house to 
announce that it was being placed on lien his income tax bill 
amounted to 2 million his friends offered to help frank sinatra 
was ready to write a check so was casino owner bill harrah 
no said davis thank you very much but i got to get out 
of it he reached a longterm agreement to repay the government 
from his earnings 
why me tells the whole story the constant touring as a kid 
with his father and will mastin the endless racial taunts 
membership in frank sinatras rat pack the violent reactions to his 
romance with kim novak and his marriage to may britt the 1954 car 
crash that cost him an eye the connections with the kennedys 
richard nixon and martin luther king the enduring marriage to his 
third wife altovise 
davis seems to remember everything but of his show business 
beginning 60 years ago he is uncertain it gets confusing i 
dont know what theyve told me about and what the reality is 
i do remember wearing long pants i couldnt have been more 
than 4 or 5 my dad and will mastin passed me off as a 44yearold 
midget i had a rubber cigar in my mouth and they would treat me 
like an adult that was the only way we could get around the child 
labor laws there was something called the gerry society that was 
strict on kids working 
it worked for a couple of years until they got wise to us dad 
and will got busted when we were playing a burlesque house on 42nd 
street burlesque in those days was the poor mans ziegfeld 
the major regret of his childhood was missing an eduation 
i didnt have one day of formal education said davis i 
never sat in a classroom in my life thats the one strict thing i 
have with my kids get an education most of them went to junior 
college but at least they went my daughter tracy went to three 
junior colleges shes a professional gotoschooler 
at 63 davis is riding high earlier this year he made his first 
screen appearance in a long time drawing good reviews in tap 
with gregory hines he recently returned from a fiveweek soldout 
tour of europe with sinatra and liza minnelli he mused about how 
well behaved the three of them were 
the only thing that upset the tour was liza and her dog she 
has been fined 2000 for bringing her dog into sweden illegally 
we were all having dinner one night and i said to liza now can 
you imagine the three of us 15 years ago they wouldnt have 
mentioned the dog we would have created so much tumult that the dog 
would have been 27th on the list 
in tap and on the tour davis danced with his oldtime vigor 
an amazing feat for a man who underwent hip reconstruction 18 months 
ago 
all those years of pounding stage floors caught up with him in 
his late 50s unable to withstand the pain he underwent a patch 
job to reconstruct the hip in 1985 he resumed performing but the 
pain returned in january 1988 he returned to cedars sinai medical 
center for an operation that replaced the femur with a prosthesis 
and rebuilt the hip socket 
i was off for 10 weeks he said i stayed in the hospital 
an extra nine days because i wanted to be ambulatory when i came 
home i went from a walker to crutches to a cane i had therapy 
which is the key to recovery it started the day after the operation 
now im back and dancing i cant dance the way i once did but 
i dont think any cat can do anything the way he used to do at 20

there will be gypsies and flamenco dancers but no 
bullfight when bizets carmen is staged next month in ancient 
nimes 
the romantic opera starring mezzosoprano grace bumbry is 
expected to attract opera lovers outdoortheater lovers and lovers 
period and promises to be the most exciting operatic event of 
frances bicentennial year tenor neil shicoff costars as don jose 
and baritone robert hale will be escamillo 
sets and costumes for the opera to be performed july 3 5 and 7 
are being designed by star couturier christian lacroix organizers 
have not revealed the cost of the lavish production 
the opera will be directed by antoine bourseiller who has been 
director of the operatheatre of nancy since 1982 and an old hand 
at carmen with past productions in nancy and lausanne 
the international production will also feature the budapest 
orchestra the bulgarian national choir and a cast of over 100 
including 20 picadors on horseback to wind up the last act 
but there will be no bull or corrida bourseiller said 
bullfights are still held twice a year in the wellpreserved 
roman arena at nimes and a live bullfight following the opera had 
been a nimes tradition since the 19th century in the years 
following world war ii such great matadors as ordonez nimeno paco 
camino and el cordobes capped the musical performances with 
bullfights 
at times the spectaculars also included bands of gypsies 
flamenco dancers circus numbers and ballet performances but in 
recent years the bullfight was dropped to focus on the opera 
masterpiece itself and as a concession to animalrights advocates 
as a boy i saw carmen with bullfights said lacroix who is 
from nearby arles she was my first love a very sexy lady the 
designer relishes the idea of dressing up miss bumbry to look far 
more splendid than the downandout gypsy cigarette girl so often 
seen in productions of the fiery opera 
but it will not look like a fashion show he said miss 
bumbry will be clad in colors to suit the drama carnation pink for 
the cabaret scenes earth colors for the smugglers scene black and 
silver for the death scene in the final act 
he is currently working on designs for sets within the arena 
which will seat about 10000 for the opera 
the site itself is so spectacular you dont need much 
scenery lacroix said well be building simple elements to 
suggest the mountains soldiers garrison cabaret and so on 
bourseiller said his production will be as true as possible to 
the spirit of bizet who based his scenario on a tale by prosper 
merimee merimees carmen was a 16yearold he said but 
obviously we dont want to show her as an adolescent 
miss bumbry 52 has received rave reviews for her interpretation 
of the sultry gypsy courtesan in paris rome and dallas and in a 
screen version directed by herbert von karajan 
i have not yet met miss bumbry said bourseiller but 
having seen her perform i admire her and think she is perhaps the 
only mezzo suited to both the drama and the difficult outdoor 
singing 
carmen has been mounted and acted in hundreds of versions 
including peter brooks iconoclastic the tragedy of carmen a 
stark production with a pareddown cast of seven in a dilapidated 
setting this style raised both critical protest and praise when it 
came out in paris and new york in the early 1980s and last month in 
glasgow 
brooks version is wonderful in a special setting such as an 
old warehouse said bourseiller but his favorite is the steamy 
1983 film version by francesco rosi starring julia migenesjohnson 
and placido domingo 
a part of the nimes summer festival carmen promises to be 
the most spectacular of the operas mounted since 1983 when musical 
activities in the arena were resumed after a hiatus of more than 15 
years 
the impressive amphitheater was built by the romans in the first 
century bc 
bourseiller says he can offer has no details yet on what sort of 
carmen character will result from his collaboration with grace 
bumbry rehearsals started june 16 
our only problem may be the weather it can get very hot down 
there but well begin after sunset which should help he said 
and then theres the mistral he added referring to the 
mighty wind that sometimes comes howling down the rhone valley 
bringing blue skies but sometimes hot tempers as well 
the acoustics are excellent in the arena but the wind creates 
a terrible handicap for singers

while growing up in the scottish village of 
auchtermuchty craig and charlie reid listened to frank sinatra ray 
charles and jim reeves 
with their closecropped hair and hornedrimmed glasses the reid 
twins could pass for a newage version of the 1960s english pop duo 
peter and gordon but as the proclaimers the brothers erase all 
doubts about their scottish roots 
i think our strength is in being ourselves and not 
compromising said charlie reid the guitarist and backing 
vocalist for the folkrock duo the group has released its second 
album sunshine on leith 
in england which i felt would be the hardest the albums gone 
platinum weve done it through working and performances it may 
take longer but the process will be worth it well find out a lot 
about america and ourselves 
the reids have been best friends all their lives and took pains 
in a recent interview to single each other out for priase as 
children they dreamed of performing together and finally took the 
step at 16 when craig acquired a drum kit and charlie learned to 
play guitar 
it was natural for us that wed be in the same band said 
charlie who deferred to his brother as the superior singer ive 
got a harsher style craigs is better to some extent the voices 
have been shaped that way because i tend to do the backup and the 
high harmonies while craig sings lead 
craig remembered their first time on stage playing at a local 
village hall 
i think one of our songs was by john lee hooker boom boom 
we did a clash song and we may have done soemthing else he said 
we were very scared people knew you very well and they dont 
think you can play music it was very noisy but it was great 
the reids fronted a punkrock group before deciding in 1983 to 
form an act of their own naming themselves the proclaimers and 
playing acoustic sets they headed for london hoping for a 
contract but were not well received by the english record companies 
they were hinting that if we sang in our own accents it may be 
difficult for people to understand what we were writing about 
craig said they said they couldnt sign us because of that 
but in 1986 the housemartins a popular british band heard a 
tape of the proclaimers and made them the opening act on their next 
tour the reids were eventually signed by chrysalis records 
their first record this is the story came out the following 
year and featured the single letter from america a hit in 
england the reids also celebrated their native accent in throw 
the r away 
a lot of scots try to get their childrens voices to be very 
proper not have them use scot words craig said they said you 
wouldnt be able to work in england if you do that 
the reids did not use a backing band for their debut album but 
have a wide range of musicians on sunshine on leith which 
features guitars drums bass keyboards mandolin fiddle melodeon 
and penny whistle 
weve always liked different sounds craig said weve 
always considered a record where you could do something a bit 
different the music could be anything we wanted having a joke 
having a laugh not taking it too seriously 
gerry hogans steel guitar is featured on my old friend the 
blues a country weeper written by steve earle the proclaimers 
also covered an earle song on their first album and count themselves 
as major country music fans 
i think that any real interest in scotch and irish music comes 
through our interest in country music craig said a real thread 
of appalachian and bluegrass music runs through scotch music it 
awakens your own identity 
craig also praised folk and country lyrics insisting that they 
cover a broader range of subjects 
basically in rock n roll you write about love and sex and 
maybe a couple of political songs and that is the limit you dont 
write about children family places 
the remaining 11 songs on sunshine on leith all written by 
the reids are a mixture of love politics and family sean is 
about charlies baby son what do you do and cap in hand 
criticize scotlands bleak economic condition 
oh jean written for a friend of craigs closes their live 
shows with the reids chanting i love her i love her working 
themselves and the audience into a frenzy 
we did a double bill once and we went on and we werent getting 
much of a reaction until we did that one craig recalled we 
tore the place apart 
you can go as long as you want charlie said you know the 
feeling when its reached the end you go into another frame of 
mind not like a trance but you do try to summon up a primal 
energy

when the nation rushed to build atomic 
bombs during world war ii and the cold war few thought the work 
might eventually prove more dangerous to the us citizens living 
near the weapons factories 
as the hanford nuclear reservation produced much of the plutonium 
for the nuclear arsenal radioactive wastes escaped into the air 
from smokestacks or were dumped into the adjacent columbia river 
in the early history of hanford there were exposures to the 
public nobody argues with that said jim ruttenber of the us 
centers for disease control fortyfive years after the first 
emissions the government is making its first attempt to learn if 
they hurt people in washington oregon and idaho 
the department of energys hanford environmental dose 
reconstruction project is under way to estimate the possible 
radiation doses residents might have received and similar studies 
are being done at the nevada test site the uranium processing plant 
at fernald ohio and other sites the cdc is about to launch a 
study of thyroid disease rates a 15 project that will focus on a 
group of 300 people at greatest risk from exposure to radioactive 
iodine 
for the scientists the issues include dose reconstruction 
environmental transport source terms uncertainty analyses and 
other jargon 
but for hanfords downwinders the issue is damaged lives 
myself and five other members of my family all have 
hypothyroidism said judith jurji whose father and two uncles 
were hanford welders from 1949 to 1956 ms jurji 43 believes the 
disease which slows the bodys metabolism and robs a person of 
vigor was caused by hanford emissions 
only the branch of her family that moved to eastern washington 
around hanford has any trace of thyroid disease ms jurji said 
the downwinders are prohibited by law from suing the federal 
government or its contractors and even if they could sue it would 
be extremely difficult to prove a longterm illness was caused by 
radiation exposure 40 years ago said jim thomas of the hanford 
education action league a citizens watchdog group 
the first step in trying to link health problems to emissions is 
dose reconstruction an elaborate attempt to estimate how much 
radiation might have reached people mostly during the 1940s the 
federal government has estimated over 435000 curies of radioactive 
material was released into the atmosphere over hanford in 19451947 
three mile island released just 15 to 24 curies 
but dose reconstruction isnt concerned with individual illness 
the 15 million 5year doe study will estimate possible radiation 
doses to the public that will be done by meticulous examination of 
such things as milk production because radioactive iodine131 
settled on grass eaten by cows weather because radioactive 
material was scattered for hundreds of miles by wind and outdoor 
recreation patterns because exposure is greatest outdoors 
the study has been attacked as not credible by some downwinders 
because it is being done by battelle pacific northwest laboratory a 
major doe contractor 
ms jurji said she is also dissatisfied by how long the work will 
take and what she perceives as the wrong attitude of the 
scientists who she said were too dispassionate at a recent 
downwinder conference in spokane 
not one person said one word of sympathy or indicated any sort 
of compassion she said they were looking like the kind of 
scientists who might have given us the problems in the first place 
the cdc study will try to determine if there are higher rates of 
thyroid disease in the region and whether that is caused by 
iodine131 which attacks the thyroid but even that wont yield 
conclusive answers in individual cases 
there is no way of measuring or detecting how somebody got 
cancer thomas said a lot of health effects are separated from 
the exposure by 20 to 40 years 
delbert barth of the university of nevadalas vegas a member of 
an independent panel overseeing the dose reconstruction project 
said at a recent meeting that it is wrong to think the study will 
produce a firm number for radiation exposure the public received 
there will only be estimates with wide margins of error 
scientists say 
hanford was built in south central washington in 1943 during the 
manhattan project the worlds first fullsized nuclear plant b 
reactor was erected in a frenzied 15 months and produced plutonium 
for the nagasaki bomb seven other plutonium reactors built along 
the columbia in the 1940s and 50s all are shut permanently a 
ninth reactor the n reactor was built in 1963 and is closed 
because of a plutonium surplus 
the releases were revealed when the energy department released 
19000 pages of previously classified documents in 1986 
most of the early releases were deliberate from normal nuclear 
operations for the time but one release the 1949 green run is 
notorious because an unknown amount of radioactivity was released so 
its path could be charted 
the term green run refers to faster processing of irradiated 
nuclear fuel into plutonium it was processed after just 16 days of 
cooling instead of the normal 40 the exact mission of the research 
is unknown though scientists have said it was to aid in monitoring 
nuclear production in the soviet union 
no one knows exactly how much was released although recent 
estimates are about 8000 curies twice what experimenters 
originally planned 
much of the green run report remains classified 
the main answer we are still looking for is why the green run 
was done who authorized it and how could it happen in a democratic 
society thomas said he wonders why the public wasnt told to 
take precautions like staying indoors and evacuating pregnant 
women during the december 1949 experiment 
the dose reconstruction projects initial report is due early 
next year and will deal with 10 counties in eastern washington and 
northeastern oregon said john till head of the oversight panel it 
will cover 194449 releases into the air and 196364 releases of 
cooling water into the columbia river 
radiation releases arent a thing of the past at the 
560squaremile site while offsite radiation is negligible 50 
million gallons of radioactive and hazardous waste from plutonium 
processing is still dumped each day

past the doors of the dying in a brightly 
colored room in the cancer ward people smile music plays and the 
sun shines in 
it is a happy area said sandra yates the units head nurse 
you dont see people walking by with long faces like you might at 
a funeral home family members are not afraid to come to the 
hospital they might not look forward to it but to me that sets it 
off 
if they arent afraid to be here then we are doing our job 
welcome to the lively room where the three stooges wc fields 
and the kids from our gang do their stuff on a 54inch tv screen 
and there are a player piano tapes of old radio shows and 
scrapbooks of cartoons 
since dekalb medical center opened the lively room in 1982 its 
been the scene of countless parties recitals and at least one 
wedding 
it helps it really does said rachel blackstone of suburban 
atlanta who spends all of each day in the ward with her terminally 
ill mother that hospital room gets mighty small after a while 
it eases the mental strain sometimes i go from here down to 
the second floor to look at the new babies the room maintains an 
upbeat feeling 
the idea of emotions effect on health isnt new in the 1400s 
surgeon henri de mondeville told his patients jokes thinking the 
levity would speed recovery the concept has won more credence but 
even in the 1960s ms yates said over 80 percent of emotion 
studies centered on the negative 
positive emotions were thought to have no purpose now were 
making inroads in positive emotions she said adding that they 
have been shown to produce enzyme and hormone changes that help 
people cope 
board member ww walsh lively donated 15000 to start the 
room but it was inspired by former saturday review editor norman 
cousins he checked out of a hospital and into a hotel with an 
armload of candid camera reruns and credited belly laughs and 
vitamin c for beating a debilitating illness 
we have seen patients who thought they would never go out of 
here but they did make it out they did go home again even if it was 
only for a short period of time ms yates said it is a good 
sound medical practice with positive results nonetheless we 
have to make sure it is therapeutic for the patients and doesnt 
make things worse for them 
the stress of most cancer wards she said usually causes a high 
turnover among nurses at dekalb it is the lowest in the hospital 
the junior nurse on the day shift for example has been there five 
years 
no matter what the condition we see people as living 
individuals with needs if we keep that in perspective it is all 
very normal to us ms yates said many people are alert to the 
very end and when they accept their disease and the outcome they 
say they are ready to go we tell them its not time yet lets 
make today the best it can be 
its important she said to respond immediately to any 
opportunity 
we had a woman who had taught dance and she said she really 
wished she could teach one more class we couldnt do the class but 
we got a ballet tape she could critique so she could have some 
input 
a 77yearold patient said she couldnt understand why she was 
still here but if she was still going to be here she wanted her hair 
colored one more time yesterday we colored her hair today she 
asked that her nails be polished 
these things may not seem important but they give hope and 
thats what its all about you can talk about hope until youre 
blue in the face but you have to give something meaningful 
if someone wants a picnic set the date for tomorrow you cant 
put things off especially here

in this healthconscious age most people 
want to know the ingredients in the food theyre eating john 
sherbon and harry lawless want to know whats in the ingredients 
but sherbon and lawless cornell university food scientists 
arent driven by health they want to determine what makes food 
taste the way it does 
its an area that is increasingly crucial in the food industry 
im not sure its possible to get anyone to try green eggs and 
ham but our job involves trying to learn what it is about green 
eggs that puts people off and maybe find a way to make them more 
appealing said sherbon 
away from the public eye and mind food scientists work on 
ways to improve what americans eat that not only means making it 
taste better but improving quality processing storage stability 
nutrients and safety 
when consumers buy a food product and eat it they decide 
whether they like it based on the product as a whole lawless said 
at cornells new 6 million food processing and development 
laboratory 
they do not necessarily look at the individual qualities of the 
food such as color taste aroma and texture under a microscope 
however scientists look at the individual pieces of the food 
puzzle trying to figure out what makes consumers like one product 
and dislike another 
in the world of big business thats a mighty tool said john w 
finley of nabisco brands inc in east hanover nj its 
important because no matter how much you spend on advertising and 
marketing people eat foods because of their flavor if its not 
tasty its not desirable its that simple 
a more basic role for taste scientists is to ensure a food tastes 
the same no matter where its made or its ingredients come from he 
said when youre dealing with agricultural commodities grown in 
half a dozen states the flavor can be extremely variable 
you want an oreo cookie to taste the same in syracuse as it 
does in miami consumers have certain expectations when they pick up 
a product theyre incredibly sensitive to change and if they dont 
like it they probably wont buy it again 
early flavor analysis the science goes back to louis pasteur 
according to sherbon was limited to tasting and smelling by human 
observers they would sample food as scientists watched and recorded 
their observations and comments sensory evaluation has come a 
long way since the days of the tongue and palate approach said 
lawless who has a background in psychology not everything is as 
easy as the pepsi challenge would have you believe 
sensory panels continue to play a major role said john 
vercellotti a research chemist with the us department of 
agricultures agriculture research service regional center in new 
orleans the center one of five in the nation has had panelists 
evaluate such foods as beef catfish and peanuts 
no matter how advanced the science gets these machines are 
only replicating what the nose and mouth do said vercellotti 
there will always be a place for them because people are the 
ultimate consumers and the ultimate decisionmakers as to what 
tastes good 
the panels can be fairly objective because assessments are made 
as a group usually from parameters established with the help of 
computers he said its kind of like an a cappella choir that 
sings with absolute pitch you dont have all the same voice you 
have many voices and they may be very different but collectively 
you come out with one harmonious sound 
what modern science has been able to do is take assessment a step 
further by pinpointing the chemical or chemicals that give a food a 
distinctive taste one of the more recent developments in this area 
is charm analysis which uses highresolution gas chromatography 
to isolate flavoractive chemicals it involves a person sitting in 
front of a chromatograph sniffing emissions and having their 
responses recorded by a computer 
the name derives from the definition of charm which is a 
property that attracts people said terry acree a chemist at 
cornells laboratory in geneva through charm analysis scientists 
can tell precisely what makes a concord grape taste different than 
other varieties or a cortland apple than a rome 
we work in anonymity said sherbon but the consumer would 
be the first to know if we werent doing our job

a young eagle carrying a 5ounce 
transmitter is helping develop techniques to track ships stolen 
cars or even prison inmates 
we want to show that it can be done that we can track 
something the size of an eagle and for a reasonable cost said 
carey roberts a researcher at the university of tennessee space 
institute the transmitter costs 3500 and time on a french 
weather satellite is about 500 a month 
the twoyear project using a french weather satellite is a 
joint venture of the university and the tennessee wildlife resources 
agency which hopes to learn more about the travel patterns of bald 
eagles 
the 1yearold eagle a male named phoenix was released at 
reelfoot lake near tiptonville on may 31 it is the first of 
several eagles perhaps as many as 12 expected to eventually take 
part in the project said bob hatcher endangered species 
coordinator for the twra 
the solarpowered transmitter strapped to the eagles back will 
send signals twice a day to a commercial satellite called argos 
which will relay the signals to a ground station in france which 
will relay them to a station in maryland from there the 
information can be picked up by the university of tennessees 
researchers using desktop computers 
the first signals are expected in tullahoma within a week or so 
roberts said many of the signals may miss the satellite depending 
on its position but impulses will be picked up about once a day 
the project could show that satellite tracking can be used to 
keep up with freight trains transport ships and even cars she 
said a number of states use electronic tracking devices to keep up 
with parolees but the range of that equipment is limited 
with these anywhere they went in the world we could find 
them roberts said

violent volcanic eruptions may be caused 
by sealed vents rather than by zones of water and volatile gases in 
magma as previously thought say scientists who studied californias 
600yearold obsidian dome 
this changes the way we think about magma chambers and suggests 
magmas may be more uniformly gas rich and not as zoned as we thought 
before said geologist john c eichelberger of sandia national 
laboratories 
violent eruptions have been explained by the influence of water 
vapor and volatile gases in the upper zone of a magma chamber deep 
beneath the earths surface the theory says trapped gases expand as 
magma is forced into lowerpressure regions near the surface 
causing explosions 
the violent eruption creates a funnelshaped opening which 
collects debris filling the vent through which subsequent magma 
must pass the porous rubble is like a sand pile keeping pressure 
on the magma but letting gas leak out before drier magma reaches the 
surface where its lower pressure results in a flow 
sandias study suggests magma acts as a sponge that can leak gas 
as it rises to the surface fractured rock in the volcanic vent 
allows gas to escape from the magma releasing pressure and causing 
less violent eruptions 
the obsidian dome volcano contains a magma tube within a broader 
vent the vent contains debris from the initial explosive eruption 
and the dome was built of lava that flowed over several weeks 
chemical studies showed the same magma caused the explosion and the 
domebuilding and that the material that built the dome lost most 
of its gas before reaching the surface 
magma that is 65 percent to 75 percent silica has silicarich 
molecules which tend to chain together and drastically increase the 
resistance to flow or viscosity silicarich magma can be up to 
100000 times more viscous thicker than basalt magma that are 40 
percent to 50 percent silica 
because silicarich magma is thicker bubbles cant rise out of 
it and escape and gas remains trapped charles r carrigan of 
sandia said if bubbles cant escape magma with as little as 3 
percent gas will expand several hundred times when it reaches the 
surface resulting in an explosion

the typical male sex offender is passive has 
low selfesteem and looks down on other sex offenders according to 
a researcher who has drawn 14 common characteristics from 10 years 
of treating offenders 
seventy percent of 56 offenders studied had 11 of the traits and 
83 percent had eight said margretta dwyer coordinator of sex 
offender treatment at the university of minnesota dwyer said the 
traits to be published in the journal of psychology amp human 
sexuality should help in developing treatment 
but she emphasized that more research is needed with control 
groups made up of those who dont commit sex offenses 
dwyers subjects ranged in age from 20 to 82 eighty percent were 
incest offenders or pedophiles thirtyfour were married 
sex offenders grow up learning to be passive dwyer wrote 
passivity is their way of interacting with life encouraged by 
the overprotective mother andor wife who makes decisions for 
them offenders tend to attract partners who will mother them 
other traits 
the typical male sex offender is manipulative he has to be 
tricky to keep from being discovered his relationship with his 
father if he knew his father was lousy his mother worried 
constantly about his health and safety 
hes angry but keeps his anger bottled up other adults 
intimidate him he tries to hold back his sexual thoughts in an 
effort to keep from committing sex crimes he often believes someone 
other than himself is committing the act 
he takes little or no responsibility preferring to believe that 
some outside force causes him to do bad things one child molester 
said she just happened to be in my bed that day another said 
i had had too much coffee that day and coffee always makes me do 
things i would never otherwise do a third said i had too much 
sugar in my system that day 
typical offenders have little knowledge of how to ask women for 
a date to receive feedback from partners or to have fun on a 
date fiftynine percent of dwyers subjects had few social or 
sexual skills 
thirtysix percent recalled being sexually abused as children 
and 40 percent had upsetting sexual experiences around age 4 
strict religious codes figured in the offenses of 26 percent

next falls tuitions are soaring for the ninth 
straight year at many colleges and universities and freshmen at a 
number of topnotch schools will get a double dose of bad news 
in a new twist schools such as the university of chicago johns 
hopkins university duke university seton hall university and 
george washington university are setting tuition increases for 
freshmen roughly double those being imposed on upperclassmen 
the new higher rates will become the base and lower rates 
charged to upperclassmen will be grandfathered or phased out 
the schools give differing explanations for their decisions to 
hit freshmen harder 
seton hall will charge freshmen 196 percent more next fall 
while upperclass tuition will go up 108 percent 
johns hopkins set tuition increases of 166 percent for freshmen 
to 14000 and 83 percent for returning students to 13000 its 
school of arts and sciences is struggling with a projected 2 
million deficit 
but john v lombardi vice president and provost said the 
primary drive was that johns hopkins found itself priced at least 
1000 below other top schools and it wanted to catch up as quickly 
as possible without angering students 
the needed increase is really larger than normal and you try 
to be fair to existing students he said thats why his school 
spared upperclassmen doubledigit rate hikes but not freshmen 
duke had a different explanation a desire to hire more faculty 
and lower studentteacher ratios from the current 131 to 111 
duke pioneered the twotiered tuition system a year ago along 
with the university of chicago this year duke freshmen will be 
charged 12800 for tuition while returning students will pay 
11350 
the idea was to fund academic improvements and enhancements 
said duke spokesman dave roberson the thinking was that students 
who were here already wouldnt benefit in time for most of those 
enhancements to be in place 
at george washington for example freshmen will see their fees 
rise by 201 percent or 2000 to 11500 returning sophomores 
juniors and seniors will be hit with only a 10 percent hike 
library acquisition costs rose 3050 percent last year said 
robert a chernak vice president for student and academic support 
services such costs along with a 6 percent rise in faculty 
salaries were key factors behind the 2 million operating deficit 
that led to next falls mammoth tuition increase 
but the large freshman tuition increases also seem to be an 
effort by some schools to raise big bucks while keeping protests to 
a minimum freshmen after all are paying tuition for the first 
time for them a big tuition increase isnt as likely to be 
perceived as a change for the worse 
still while it may be highly unlikely that students at duke 
hopkins or other top private schools would stage angry tuition 
protests similar to those that greeted the university of oklahoma 
and city university of new york recently higher education spokesmen 
say theres increasing sensitivity to the issue of outrageous 
tuition hikes 
tuitions at both public and private institutions had shot up in 
double digits from 1981 to 1984 but had moderated somewhat in the 
last three years in 198889 they were up an average of 5 percent 
at publics and 9 percent at privates according to the college board 
but signs are that the moderating trend may be over at least for 
next fall schools are declaring tuition hikes ranging from 715 
percent 
tuitions at public research universities rose from an average of 
549 in 1973 to 1701 in 1988 a 210 percent increase according to 
a justpublished report by the denverbased state higher education 
executive officers 
the increases during that 15year period were greatest in the 
south 234 percent and smallest in the northeast 209 percent 
the report found 
and economists see no signs that upward pressure will end any 
time soon 
i see trends that have been going on for a decade that are not 
moderating the need for financial aid the rising cost of library 
acquisitions the need to improve salaries said richard rosser 
president of the national association of independent colleges and 
universities in washington 
at cornell university which has announced a tuition increase of 
roughly 7 percent for this fall financial aid costs will reach 
178 million compared with just 51 million in 1981 according to 
spokesman sam segal 
overall the nations private colleges are spending 35 billion 
on financial aid compared with 900 million in 1979 a fact rosser 
blamed on cuts in federal aid programs 
meanwhile public universities had moderated their average 
tuition hikes to 56 percent in the last several years compared 
with increases that reached a high of 20 percent in 19823 but 
higher education officials note growing sentiment in many states 
especially those with budgetary problems to boost students share 
of the cost of public college 
on average tuition and fees cover just 2533 percent of the cost 
of an education at a public university compared to about 80 percent 
at a private college said robert aaron a spokesman for the 
national association of state universities and land grant colleges 
it is fair to say that states in fiscal stress are looking for 
ways to diminish their higher education burden and are looking for 
students and parents to pay a larger share aaron said

if president bush had his druthers all parents 
would have the right to choose the public school their child 
attends but its a controversial vision that makes some people 
nervous 
with little money available to sink into education bush is 
promoting concepts that may help him fulfill his campaign pledge to 
be the education president without making new demands on the 
federal treasury choice foremost among them 
at a white house workshop held before he took office bush called 
public school choice the single most promising idea in education 
today and education secretary lauro cavazos refers to choice as the 
cornerstone of education reform 
against this backdrop of highlevel exhortation scores of 
districts and state legislatures across the country are enacting or 
at least discussing various types of open enrollment plans 
some like minnesotas pioneering plan allow parents to choose 
schools in any district in the state while others such as a highly 
successful east harlem ny program are confined to a single 
district some plans rely heavily on magnet schools some provide 
transportation and others do not 
a major defeat occurred in new mexico when a state senate 
committee killed a statewide choice plan but setbacks have been the 
exception not the rule 
at least two states arkansas and iowa have followed minnesotas 
lead and enacted open enrollment programs allowing students to 
attend any school in the state nearly two dozen states this year 
were studying or considering similar comprehensive choice proposals 
or narrower ones that apply to dropouts upperclassmen or atrisk 
students 
in a series of steps designed to fuel the movement cavazos 
appointed a special adviser and task force to promote and evaluate 
choice projects he said he would hold regional conferences on 
choice strategies and give top priority to choice projects in 
awarding education innovation grants 
the theory behind public school choice is that it gives parents 
more control over their childrens education and at the same time 
creates competition that will theoretically shake up and improve bad 
schools 
but reactions among educators and even parents have been mixed 
some predict logistical nightmares and soaring transportation costs 
others wonder if it is possible to ensure equity under an open 
enrollment system whether some innercity schools will be 
virtually abandoned to those least able to take advantage of their 
new options 
its a very complicated issue harvard education professor 
sara lawrence lightfoot said recently we have to think about 
making knowledge about schools available to everyone 
lightfoot said the concern is that better educated higher status 
people will have more information and make better choices for their 
children she described a scenario where the brighter more 
capable more affluent people are drawn to a certain setting the 
cream is taken from the milk and the others are left behind 
leaders of the two teacher unions have expressed cautious 
optimism about school choice provided there are safeguards to make 
sure deprived children are not further penalized some of the 
strongest reservations are found among administrators and school 
board presidents 
a survey of the board presidents earlier this year found that 
only 36 percent believed parents should be able to select their 
childs school that compares to 71 percent of the public who 
supported the idea in a 1987 gallup poll 
in essence the secretarys approach would do the least for 
those who have the least charged richard miller executive 
director of the american association of school administrators after 
cavazos had announced his choice initiatives 
in a speech this year to newspaper editors cavazos made a 
special point of saying any public school choice program must be 
very very sensitive to equity in the system by upgrading ghetto 
schools and making transportation available to poor students who opt 
to go elsewhere 
if schools are unacceptable he said states should take them 
over or shut them down 
several weeks later he told education writers that districts are 
already spending enormous amounts of money and should divert some of 
it to transportation if they are serious about choice 
the minnesota plan does not provide transportation however 
cavazos remarked that some of the students there would drive 100 
miles on their own to go to the school of their choice 
cavazos is fervent about school choice at least partly because he 
considers himself an early beneficiary of the idea where he grew up 
on a texas ranch he said there were three local schools one for 
blacks one for hispanics and one for anglos 
the anglo school had the best education program anyone could 
see it he told education writers this year so his father the 
ranch foreman got cavazos and his siblings into the anglo school 
how he did it i dont know the secretary said i consider 
that to be the first example of choice

many parents who try to teach their 
children to read should offer them a good book and a soft shoulder 
rather than flashcard drill sessions says an authority on reading 
we need to have better parent education says claudia 
cornett associate professor of education at wittenberg university 
parents do not understand what is involved 
ms cornett says parents are sincere but often misguided when 
they emphasize what they think is the means to successful reading 
they will pick out a little piece like phonics for example or 
drill the kids on the alphabet she says thats such a limited 
view 
at the other extreme she says are parents who simply dont care 
theirs is a crime of omission says ms cornett theyre 
not doing anything theyre not reading to their kids 
ms cornett says parents must learn to lay the foundation for 
reading 
they need to read to them and i dont mean just to get it 
done she says i mean they have to read with enthusiasm this 
should not be a chore good childrens literature should be just as 
enjoyable to an adult as it is to a child 
ms cornett says parents must also interact with their children 
discuss stories they read and ask them questions about it 
even reading to children as young as 2 years old exposes them to 
the music of the language and allows them to pick up some 
concepts offered by the illustrations she says 
probably the most important thing thats happening is that 
youre giving him a positive association with the act of reading 
she says youre close youre warm youre hugging smiling 
youre together if children came to school loving being read to 
half the job of the teacher would be done 
ms cornett was instrumental in setting up the wittenberg reading 
center the facility aims at teaching reading for meaning while 
keeping it enjoyable the method involves drama art music 
creative writing riddles jokes and the use of tape recorders 
ms cornett says worksheets dittos and other drilllike 
activities in the classroom can be deadly to childrens creativity 
and blunt their interest in reading the teaching method either 
liberates a childs creativity or confines and kills it she 
says 
she says learning to read is not grounded in printed symbols but 
rather is the ability to listen to ideas 
reading is a thinking activity she says you absolutely 
cannot read and understand things that arent a part of your 
experience 
she says children must be permitted and encouraged to play which 
allows them to learn about their environment and to discover 
relationships 
reading is grounded in thinking so they have to have all of 
these experiences she says its about those kinds of 
experiences that eventually children will be reading and unless 
they have that background they cannot understand it 
ms cornett received wittenberg universitys 1989 alumni 
association award for distinguished teaching she has delivered more 
than 200 speeches around the country and has written eight books on 
reading 
she says that even more than illiteracy she is concerned about 
people who can read but dont 
thats very disturbing she says adding that recent 
statistics show that 90 percent of the library books are checked out 
by 5 percent of the population 
we cant just teach people to read she says we have to 
have people realize the purpose of it to enjoy to get 
information to solve problems that whole idea of purpose is so 
critical to motivation 
ms cornett says that while television isnt generally an 
interactive experience a certain amount of it can be educational 
for children she cited recent studies showing that children who 
watch too much television and those that watch none at all are both 
at a disadvantage 
an hour a day really can be an advantage she said its 
familiarizing children with a lot of things people discuss common 
culture kinds of things the concern is the extremes

a prime weapon against illiteracy is the computer 
far from being a rich childs toy the machine is touching 
children in all reaches of society freeing teachers for oneonone 
attention for students and helping unlock the written word to many 
from illiterate backgrounds 
the state of mississippi with one of the highest rates of 
illiteracy in the nation is putting computers into every school in 
the state in an effort to teach basic reading and writing skills to 
every child the first computers will be in classrooms this fall 
and all elementary schools in the state will be equipped within four 
years 
the state is using the writing to read program developed by a 
retired educator john henry martin and produced and marketed by 
ibm the company says it has been put into at least 5000 schools 
across the country helping an estimated one million school children 
in designing the program which uses computers audio cassettes 
and typewriters martin sought to replicate the comfortable 
interaction of the oneroom schoolhouse his own experience as a 
young teacher and with his later research into how children learn 
convinced him that a less structured atmosphere not bound off by 
age and set curriculum encourages children to learn better at 
their own pace 
moving from one work station to the next children first 
learn basic phonemes or lettersound combinations through 
computers and earphones familiar objects are illustrated and 
matched to written and oral words audio tapes at the next work 
station reinforce what theyve learned at the computer and the 
following one the library station familiarizes them with written 
english they then use this knowledge to write stories based on 
their own oral language at the writingtyping station at the final 
station children experiment with new combinations of letters and 
words to develop wordbuilding skills using many media pencil 
chalk clay rubber stamps and so on the aim is to expose children 
to all ways of writing 
we dont know from one child to the next which child learns 
best by seeing by hearing by feeling or by holding and we want 
to engage everything in the child explains martin 
children are not intimidated by the computer and because the 
program lets each one move ahead at his own speed that child has no 
fear of failure the children know they are teaching themselves 
they learn to type even as they learn to recognize the letter 
symbols martin says that by avoiding the labor of forming letters 
by hand children can concentrate on what they want to say 
he estimates that kindergartners have vocabularies of around 
1000 words when they start school to reduce them to a hundred 
words in a primer is to ask them to go back to eating pablum 
there are a half million words in english a magnificent 
intellectual achievement but when you mess it up with all the 
peculiar spellings we use in english as a way of having children 
learn to have them encode to write then have them decode to read 
you take the logic out of the system and you confuse things 
the children go straight to writing for meaning spelling 
phonemically later they easily learn accepted spellings 
the program has been adapted for spanishspeaking students voy 
a leer escribiendo or vale and for functionally illiterate adults 
principle of alphabet literacy or pals 
martin former chairman of the national panel on high school and 
adolescent education of the department of health education and 
welfare and the us office of education developed the program on a 
personal computer while recovering from a heart attack in l973 ibm 
agreed to produce and market the program with martins stipulation 
to run field tests first under direction of the education testing 
service of princeton nj 
the ets evaluation covering 10000 students in 21 school 
districts in the first year and samples of students in the second 
year showed that the computerassisted children on average learned 
faster and excelled at writing performance teachers interviewed in 
the study said that these students spent more time writing 
creatively and less time on phonic and structural analysis 
the mississippi program is the most ambitious but another 
largescale use is in the new york city schools which has set up 
100 writing to read laboratories it also has been used to teach 
english overseas 
mississippi will be the first state in the country to our 
knowledge to have such an extensive computer literacy system for 
its children said gov ray mabus as he and his wife julie 
announced the program last spring every child should when this 
program is in place leave the first grade knowing how to read and 
write 
about 400000 adults in mississippi out of a population of 23 
million are estimated to be functionally illiterate 
the state has received grants from the riordan foundation of los 
angeles and the ford foundation of new york to help finance the 
program

couch potatoes in the classroom 
its a likely scenario this fall as more and more cable networks 
tout educational offerings specifically designed as teaching aids 
the competition took off in controversy with the debut of channel 
one a flashy 12minute newscast with two commercials cable news 
network soon weighed in with a news program minus the ads followed 
by the discovery channel with a fivedayaweek documentary package 
available for taping 
and that doesnt include other schooloriented programs from 
cspan the learning channel and the arts and entertainment network 
the offerings range from live public events and congressional 
coverage on cspan to nature films and historical documentaries on 
discovery the learning channel featured vintage films like oliver 
twist and a farewell to arms on a program designed to 
encourage reading of the classics 
and then there are the rival news programs from cnn and whittle 
communications producer of channel one 
whittle conducted a 5 million sevenweek test run in six 
schools last spring with candy bars shampoo and jeans among the 
products advertised company officials are determining whether to 
launch the program in 8000 schools in 1990 a 100 million project 
the trial run drew fire for a number of reasons educators 
objected to inflicting ads on a captive audience they also 
complained that the program heavy on graphics and hip teenage 
anchors was superficial 
channel one is social studies by 90second sound bites 
charged scott thomson executive director of the national 
association of secondary school principals furthermore he said 
the program allows special interests to reach kids through 
television commercials which they are forced to watch 
christopher whittle chairman of whittle communications says the 
ads are necessary to finance the 50000 in satellite dishes tvs 
and vcrs given to schools that promise to show his program daily 
were this a perfect world we would agree that the government 
not commercials should provide this technology and programming 
whittle wrote in a new york times oped piece but in todays real 
world of 20 textbook budgets and tough fiscal constraints two 
minutes of appropriate advertising is not a bad solution 
whittle suffered a blow in may when the california department of 
education said the state could not be billed for education funds for 
time students spent watching commercials in class such time will 
be deleted from the certification the department said in a legal 
opinion 
the department also said that the imposition of forced 
commercial advertising on schoolchildren may violate the state 
constitution 
educators and tv watchdogs are reacting more favorably to the 
daily cnn newsroom due to start aug 14 in time for the fall 
school term a full year before channel one would be available in 
classrooms across the country 
they note that cnn is a legitimate news operation the 15minute 
program would feature adult anchors and use of it in the classroom 
would be voluntary and at the teachers discretion perhaps most 
important of all cnn founder ted turner decided at the last minute 
to ditch the commercials initially planned for the package 
turner says cnn newsroom will cost millions of dollars but 
cnn is profitable enough to absorb the expense whittles venture 
would be a moneymaker while discovery with its daily hourlong 
assignment discovery expects to break even by enlisting 
corporate and foundation underwriters 
the discovery underwriters will be identified onscreen but their 
names will never interrupt either of the two educational segments 
planned for each hour thus students will never have to see the 
sponsorship billboards 
the education community has reserved its highest praise for the 
discovery series which starts sept 18 for one thing it is 
divided into systematic teacherfriendly curriculum blocks social 
studies teachers for example will know that documentaries in their 
field are shown on tuesdays 
furthermore the network is getting educational rights to each 
program so teachers can tape segments at their convenience and use 
them if and when they want teachers consequently remain in control 
of what happens in their classrooms rather than being forced to 
show a daily program such as channel one that may or may not be 
the best use of time that day 
if there are ways to provide this technology when where and 
how the teacher feels it best enhances instruction discussion and 
comprehension then it is to be applauded said manya ungar 
president of the national pta if it doesnt its a detriment

its possible to get an ivy league education without ivy league 
costs 
good public colleges with private school ambience and advantages 
can be found according to education experts 
there are a number of small public institutions that are 
rapidly reaching the standards of the little private ivys says 
richard moll who has served in admissions administration at harvard 
and yale universities and has written a book the public ivys 
these small public colleges usually have high quality students 
and faculty small classes rigorous curriculum an intellectual 
atmosphere and personal attention to students campus population 
averages about 3000 which works out to about 22 students in each 
class 
moll says tuition costs at these colleges range between 850 and 
1500 per year for instate students 2500 to 4000 for 
outofstaters room and board typically come to about 3000 this 
contrasts with private school tuition and fees which averaged 
12526 in l98889 
nearly two thirds of public college students receive financial 
aid averaging 2800 a year while the same proportion at private 
schools receives an average of 6000 
some of the schools mentioned by moll and another author martin 
nemko include evergreen state college at olympia wash st marys

environmental studies trendy in the early 1970s but dropped by 
many colleges for lack of interest have moved back into the 
academic mainstream 
new interest may have been triggered by concerns about the 
threats to the ozone layer and by incidents like the valdez oil 
spill colleges say but the more likely reason is that the field is 
maturing 
the typical environmental activist has been succeeded by the 
student with purely academic analytical skills says ortwin renn 
professor of environment technology and society at clark university 
in worcester mass students today focus more on integration of 
technical and policy issues they are not advocates but people who 
understand science and the issues and can argue their cases 
effectively 
the most serious work is being done among his graduate students 
many of them on sabbatical from environmental posts in agencies or 
private firms returning to school for advanced scientific study 
there is renewed interest in environmental issues though it 
seems to be coming from our international studies students rather 
than our biology majors says steve anderson professor of biology 
and the university of the pacific in stockton calif students are 
taking a more global view of the world situation recognizing that 
the worlds political and economic issues have definite 
environmental components 
bowdoin college antioch university and hood college are among 
colleges reporting increased enrollments for environmental studies 
bowdoin at brunswick me says the number of environmental 
studies majors has quadrupled in the last three years some of our 
most dedicated students come from areas of major pollution for 
example we have several eager students from chesapeake bay says 
edward laine director of its environmental studies program 
mitchell thomashaw cochair of antiochs environmental studies 
at its new england graduate school in keene nh also reports a 
dramatic increase in enrollment for its program which he says 
emphasizes leadership management theory and communications skills 
 
at hood in frederick md interest in environmental studies has 
remained constant in recent years but entrylevel course enrollment 
has tripled recently john commito professor of biology and 
director of environmental studies attributes the rise to current 
issues in the news commito says that students at a womans college 
like hood often take the introductory courses but wont major in the 
subject because they feel they were poorly prepared in mathematics 
and science during high school 
some institutions are building their course studies around local 
issues students at st marys college in st marys city md are 
researching habitats on the river by their school part of the 
chesapeake bay system two seniors are conducting a study on a 
disease which is killing oysters in the river and at whitman 
college in walla walla wash environmental students are working on 
recycling facilities for all campus residence houses 
the second generation of environmental management as clarks 
renn calls it signals a new credibilty for the field it 
signifies that environment is part of normal policy not just 
reaction to the news

if only i knew then what i know now 
are among the sadder words of school graduates 
but a group of upperclass university of rochester students tried 
to ease that predicament for prospective freshmen recently by 
sharing with them what they had learned about the social and 
academic side of campus life 
one of the tips from the students involved organizing their time 
making and keeping a schedule 
be prepared that it may take a while to learn what you can and 
cant fit in said patricia singleton 21 a junior from walnut 
ridge ark 
and dont panic youll find a way of balancing your 
activities but it does take time effort and willpower 
some found that having outside jobs while at school actually 
helped them in scheduling study time 
because i was busy working and participating in extracurricular 
groups i had to allocate my time for each activity working 
studying relaxing if you have a lot of free time its actually 
easier to blow off studying said caroline chung 20 a 
sophomore from dekalb ill 
the students agreed that getting involved in extracurricular 
activities right away was a good idea 
join the undergraduate organization affiliated with the 
department go on any trips or just attend lectures dinners and 
receptions where faculty are present said senior tracy coskie 
22 of pittsford ny youll get more out of your education if 
you get to know faculty out of the classroom 
some other tips 
on money one of the things i learned is that when i go 
shopping i have to leave my checkbook behind 
on roommates bring up problems you have with your roommates 
behavior immediately if you do it in a calm manner it probably 
wont be a big deal but if you wait until youre furious about 
something thats been going on for two months then things may get 
out of hand 
on the freshman slump everybody feels that way freshman 
year when so much is new and different dont put pressure on 
yourself to do everything perfectly give yourself room to adjust to 
the differences of college life just relax do your best and have 
fun

some teenage achievers say motivation 
and care are needed to help their less brilliant classmates learn 
more and prepare for life 
class size and individual attention are seen as important and 
the teens think that while more money for schools is needed its 
not as important as the other factors 
these attitudes were revealed by a poll of students listed in 
whos who among american high school students organized by its 
publishers 
a lot of students in my school arent motivated to learn 
reports matt henry of florissant mo one of the students henry 
says motivating students is a shared responsibility of students 
teachers and parents its up to students to make an effort but 
its also up to teachers to present material in a way thats 
interesting and relevant to todays world 
colleen boyle of twinsburg ohio also thinks parental 
involvement is important my parents have always shown a lot of 
interest in my academic progress as well as my extracurricular 
activities and its been a big boost in helping me go forward some 
students arent so lucky 
large class size got poor marks from the students in a large 
school like mine many students seem to graduate without the basic 
knowledge needed to succeed says lindsey taucher of plano texas 
adds claudine cangiano from plandome ny in a large high school 
environment like mine a student may feel like a number 
she also thinks schools rely too much on computers they can 
enhance the learning process but they cannot replace teachers 
individual attention is still important 
todd disimone from lockport ill says that money spent on 
higher teacher salaries will draw more and better candidates then 
the overall quality of teaching might be higher 
but ms cangiano disagrees saying she thinks more money wont 
make that much difference good teachers are those who love what 
they do and will give it their all regardless of how much they are 
paid

if the first concern of going to college is high tuition cost 
then the next is financing it especially if your income is too high 
to qualify for federally supported loans 
supplemental loans privately financed often with institutional 
connections often can fill the gap and are available when other 
sources are not 
in the case of parents who have more than one child going to 
college its often difficult to pull together the necessary funds 
from savings or monthly income to cover tuition payments says 
diane l saunders spokesperson for the nonprofit new england 
education loan marketing corporation or nellie mae this is where 
supplemental loan programs can help greatly 
similar to business and personal loans supplementals are based 
on credit not need sponsors include state agencies nonprofit 
corporations lending organizations and colleges and universities 
either individually or through cooperative consortiums financing is 
through bond issues or other private sources 
higher loan limits and longer repayment schedules than federal 
loans characterize most of them interest rates are higher than the 
federal loans but still lower than personal or consumer loans many 
offer options to pay interest only during the students enrollment 
deferring the principal 
some of the supplementals can be found only in particular areas 
though others offer help nationally and can be used at any 
accredited college or university 
public libraries boards or departments of education guidance 
counselors and the universities themselves can help you locate a 
supplemental loan program one of the best sources is the college 
or university at which the student has been accepted says ms 
saunders 
she adds that nellie mae offers supplemental loan programs for 
both undergraduate and postgraduate students called excel and share 
for more information contact nellie mae at 50 braintree hill park

a potential school dropout exhibits early warning signals that 
can help his parents head off the problem 
unfortunately many parents miss the signals and find themselves 
surprised when the adolescent decides to drop out of school without 
a diploma says glenn hogen vice president of sylvan learning 
corporation a supplemental learning service 
children exhibit symptoms even as early as first or second 
grade that signal trouble ahead and indicate the potential for a 
dropout situation he says 
he advises parents to be alert to these warning signals and 
intervene early with help from teachers lay or religious 
counselors or medical authorities counselors can act as 
intermediaries between parent and child and can accurately analyze 
the extent of the problem says hogen 
some of signs he cites 
a new pattern of dropping grades after a record of good grades 
teacher comments like not working up to potential or does 
not pay attention in class the comment is wellmannered in the 
classroom may be a euphemism for disinterest 
failure to complete homework 
lack of interest in sports or classroom activities 
behavioral problems such as fighting with other students or other 
attempts to provoke expulsion 
negative comments about teachers 
blaming others 
becoming either passive or noisy 
hogen says the problem often develops after the student has 
missed learning and finds he cant overcome the gap as he falls 
further behind he gives up in frustration and anger 
positive things parents can do include reading and discussing 
report cards in a nonjudgmental way with the child praising his 
successes communicating with teachers asking the child for his 
feelings and opinions and how he thinks he can improve encouraging 
him to develop realistic but challenging goals to improve study 
habits providing guidance and ground rules and discussing not 
grilling him about his progress and school activities weekly 
active listening is crucial that means going beneath the words 
to the meanings and emotions or what children are not saying 
hogen says

the idea of summer vacation for children 
should be reexamined with summer activities whether school a 
job or camp arranged to fit the individual child says a los 
angeles psychologist 
a whole summer of inactivity breaks the study chain says dr 
robert r butterworth a specialist in youth psychology an 
integrated program of work study and leisure can be designed so 
that what the child learns in the longer term doesnt get lost in a 
summer dropoff 
im not saying that kids shouldnt have a vacation but for two 
months and two weeks 
the problem is that many parents cant cope with deciding what 
kind of plans to make for their children he says and the choices 
they make often backfire he adds 
they dont know how to approach it directly its an emotional 
situation he says 
for one thing he says theres no evidence that summer jobs will 
help underachievers or problem children the discretionary income 
often distorts teens focus and often that income goes for drugs 
summer jobs wont turn them around 
and high achievers the ones who usually go to summer school 
really dont need it he says often the achievers need a break 
good students need little or no supervision but need to be 
encouraged to find a creative changeofpace summer activity 
including volunteer work 
average achievers also may benefit from volunteering attending 
academic camp reading or learning a new academic skill the low 
achiever usually a child who simply doesnt work up to his 
capabilities should be steered to summer school and encouraged to 
develop good study and work habits 
low achievers who also have drug alcohol or behavioral problems 
need a very structured summer job or school program according to 
butterworth they need strict curfews high supervision and perhaps 
group treatment for their problems for this group too much free 
time can be dangerous and can lead to trouble 
unfortunately youngsters who need the most help are the ones 
least likely to get it he says

moderation in all things including your kids school lunch 
yes be concerned about nutrition but dont worry too much if he 
pigs out occasionally 
obviously you can exercise greater control over what he eats if 
hes a brown bagger but accept that his social needs are going to 
take him now and then to fast food establishments whose menus 
include highfat items like hamburgers and thick milkshakes 
theres no firm agreement among pediatricians and other health 
care professionals about how much fat is too much though they do 
agree that children need fat for growth about 30 to 40 percent of a 
childs calories should come from fat recommends the american 
academy of pediatrics thats close to the 3439 percent spread 
shown in a federal survey of the current diets of american children 
i think runofthemill parents should be aware that a highfat 
diet is not good advises the academys nutrition committee 
chairman dr laurence finberg you dont need to say it any more 
stringently than that 
cholesterol levels in children now average about 160 milligrams 
per deciliter of blood many doctors think a child would benefit 
from a lower average the target would be a level of 200 or lower by 
the time the child reaches adulthood we believe that the ideal 
level of cholesterol in the blood would be between 110 and 140 for 
children says dr curtis ellison a cardiologist at boston 
university medical school 
its normal for kids to go through periods in which they eat 
the same foods day in and day out says david mintz whose 
company tofutti brands inc makes cholesterolfree foods it 
reflects emerging independent behavior and developing tastebuds 
he suggests offsetting these temporary food jags by making 
sure that a variety of grains fruits vegetables and protein foods 
meats poultry fish and legumes are available at home meals 
and using the leftovers will enable parents to vary the contents of 
the lunch bag 
he also suggests preparing lowfat meals prepared at home on days 
when the child has pizza at the school cafeteria or hamburgers at 
the neighborhood hangout and providing nutritional snack food to 
substitute for the highcalorie highfat versions will encourage 
children to eat sensibly some examples he cites include yogurt with 
fresh fruit or cholesterolfree frozen desserts for sweets 
pretzels popcorn or dry unsweetened cereal for munching and 
unsweetened fruit juices for beverages

in the belief that writing is the key to all 
learning the crestview elementary school teaches writing as its 
main course from kindergarten to the fifth grade 
crestview students prefer writing to toys says one of the 
kindergarten teachers at this public magnet school you give them 
word games and a chance to write and they get really into it 
the school calls itself the center for learning through writing 
and the principal jill witlin says that the intensified writing 
program helps the students move ahead quickly by writing 
children learn more and become more literate 
all subjects are taught within the context of writing children 
are introduced to vocabulary relevant to the subject and encouraged 
to form sentences with these words spelling and grammar are 
finetuned later 
when you know how to write you get to learn all the other 
aspects of literacy says dr evelyn rothstein who with dr diane 
gess created the write track program the school uses 
based in nyack ny both these experienced educators visit 
schools with the write track system training teachers how to use 
it they also provide complementary classroom materials 
programs are in place in schools especially committed to 
improving literacy skills such as public schools in clovis nm 
moss point miss and new york city crestview is unusual in that 
it uses the program as the key part of its magnet school approach

americas widespread math illiteracy might be less of a problem 
if parents became more involved in their childrens math education 
according to a chicago learning authority 
many theories have been propounded on why us youngsters 
appear to have problems coping with math says robert baseman 
president of the american learning corp a division of 
encyclopaedia britannica inc 
what it comes down to however is the need for parents to be 
more directly involved in their childrens math training we think 
there is reason for optimism if youth and parents work together 
basemans optimism is based on observations in other countries 
where parents frequently become deeply involved in their childrens 
math education 
in these situations he explains if a child faces problems his 
parents are then in a better position to detect the whys and 
wherefores needed to solve the problems 
the shortcomings of us mathematics standards have been 
underscored in recent reports finding american students being 
outperformed by their counterparts in four other countries south 
korea spain ireland and the united kingdom and four canadian 
provinces 
one way to apply parent power to the math illiteracy problem is 
to incorporate a sense of fun into the process says baseman 
when you take a child shopping he suggests let him help weigh 
produce count change and price the best buy 
if a child has missed school try to learn what math concepts 
were taught when he or she was absent baseman adds because failure 
to learn a concept when it is taught can hamper future performance 
baseman also suggests 
when planning a longdistance vacation or other trip by car 
have your child use road maps to determine the number of miles to 
your destination 
when baking or cooking have your child help by reading 
directions on packages and measuring incredients into bowls let 
them become familiar with measuring spoons and cups 
have your child log how his or her allowance money is spent 
during a particular period say vacation time or over the summer 
months based on money received and money spent your child should 
be able to determine the percentage of money saved

more public school funding does not necessarily mean improved 
student performance says a university of rochester ny economist 
there is little if any relationship between differences in 
spending and the quality of schooling says professor eric 
hanushek in a recent issue of educational researcher magazine 
its tempting to believe that the amount of money spent on 
education will determine how well students will perform he says 
the logic is compelling we figure that with more money we can 
attract better teachers create superior programs and reduce 
classroom overcrowding so that students can get more individualized 
instruction 
unfortunately this strategy by itself has not led to 
significant improvements in students achievements 
family background he says has a major influence on students as 
does the skill of their teachers 
there is no substitute for good teachers he says but 
differences in teacher skill are not strongly related to 
educational backgrounds amount of teaching experience or teaching 
in small classes 
hanushek says schools should direct their attention to the actual 
performance of teachers through such incentives as merit pay 
hanushek former deputy director of the congressional budget 
office analyzed 187 separate studies of students performance at 
primary and secondary schools during the past 20 years

dont stress your child by arranging too many afterschool 
activities advises a child psychiatrist 
time to play and to relax is important without constant 
pressure to succeed eventually a child may even hook into genuine 
interests says dr richard oberfield clinical associate 
professor of psychiatry at new york university medical center 
parents should ask themselves if they are providing lessons and 
activities for themselves instead of the child he advises if you 
always wanted to play three musical instruments but couldnt dont 
force that dream on your children its one thing to introduce them 
to opportunities to learn and quite another to make them mandatory 
its important for parents to spend unstructured time with their 
children he adds this gives them the feeling of being cared 
about for themselves not just for their performance which is 
integral to their selfesteem

what a teacher wears in the classroom affects the response of her 
students but the result may not be as expected 
a miami university study shows that most students prefer a 
teacher who wears jeans over the one who wears a suit 
you might anticipate that a female teacher in a suit would get 
the most respect but my research doesnt show that says dr sara 
butler associate professor of home economics and consumer sciences 
at miamis oxford ohio campus butler and a graduate student 
kathy roesel surveyed 201 students at two northern kentucky high 
schools to find out how female teachers clothes affect them there 
were 157 girls and 44 boys in the study 
the teacher in jeans was generally viewed as fun approachable 
not especially knowledgeable not looking like a teacher and 
generally preferable says butler curiously that teacher was 
seen as least fair when it came to grades 
in contrast the suited teacher was seen as possessing the 
image of a teacher but was the teacher students preferred not to 
have this teacher was seen as unapproachable not especially fun 
and an authority figure who assigns homework

antonio cipollone his name out of the 
newspapers and into the lawbooks has gone back to a quiet retiree 
life strolling on the boardwalk visiting relatives and traveling a 
bit 
one trip brought the 65yearold italian immigrant to the united 
nations may 31 where the world health organization awarded him a 
medal for his landmark legal fight 
a year ago tuesday six federal court jurors here awarded him 
400000 for the lungcancer death of his wife rose the nations 
first damages judgment in a smokerdeath case the verdict is being 
appealed 
i dont know if i could do it again said cipollone of 
lakehurst nj i was really tired lets face it it was every 
day every day it was really rough for a while 
for 4 months all eyes in the 22 billion tobacco industry and 
antismoking forces were focused on cipollones court case against 
liggett group inc lorillard inc and philip morris inc the 
companies made the cigarettes smoked by mrs cipollone for 40 years 
before she died at the age of 58 five years ago 
jurors found that liggett had violated an express warranty or 
advertising promise that its products were safe all three companies 
were absolved of conspiring to defraud the public about the health 
dangers of smoking 
but the industrys 30year invincibility had been violated and 
tobacco opponents were encouraged that a new surge of lawsuits might 
be launched 
it has not happened 
from a peak of 150 in 1987 the number of pending suits against 
the industry has dropped to around 80 cigarette companies and 
tobacco analysts say 
in a sense theyre quiet times said richard daynard a 
northeastern university law professor who heads the tobacco products 
liability project which supports lawyers suing the cigarette 
industry 
i think people are waiting for additional developments 
plaintiffs attorneys before they make their investments in these 
cases he said 
the industry and some wall street analysts see the antismoking 
litigants in retreat 
the proof is in the pudding said kurt a feuerman an 
analyst at drexel burnham lambert the number of cases is much 
lower 
he points to other numbers the continued flood of profits to the 
cigarette makers and the health of their stock 
the day after the verdict tobacco stocks retreated but have 
since come back mightily philip morris postverdict price of about 
83 for example is now around 140 
the industry also argued that the relatively small award 
discouraged other wouldbe antitobacco lawyers from suing in light 
of the years of work and millions of dollars needed to battle the 
industry 
it was an absolute masterpiece of spin control on their part 
to take a defeat and turn it into if not a victory at least a 
nondefeat countered daynard 
cipollones lead attorney marc z edell acknowledged some 
attorneys may have been discouraged 
i think the momentum of the cases has stopped basically and 
the easy pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that a lot of lawyers 
anticipated would rise out of these cases just isnt there 
whats needed is expertise in developing such cases and practice 
in trying them he said theres also the question of whether the 
cipollone verdict will stand up on appeal 
we dont want to undertake the financial commitment as well as 
the professional commitment to represent people when we dont know 
what the future will bring said edell who has five cigarette 
cases on hold in new jersey 
a federal appeals court is considering liggetts challenge to the 
express warranty verdict the state supreme court also is 
considering edells challenge of a 1987 new jersey law excusing 
cigarettes from the riskutility theory of liability that is 
whether a products risk outweighs its usefulness 
this fall should bring a flurry of activity three cases are set 
for trial then in beaumont texas boston and lexington miss 
daynard still believes that some day the cipollone case will 
prove a watershed in tobacco litigation 
he reports receiving requests for 150 sets of documents 
introduced at the cipollone trial the case was considered unique 
for the large quantity of damaging corporate memos and reports 
introduced at trial 
antitobacco litigants say their availability sharply reduces the 
enormous costs of waging a legal war against cigarette makers 
edell who has made about 20 lecture appearances since the trial 
said the case also led to a tremendous volume of inquiries from 
other wouldbe plaintiffs though he has taken no new cases 
we dont want to undertake the financial commitment as well as 
the professional commitment to represent people when we dont know 
what the future will bring he said referring to the pending 
appeal of the cipollone verdict he has five cigarette cases on hold 
in new jersey 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals is considering liggetts 
challenge to the express warranty verdict the state supreme court 
also is considering edells challenge of a 1987 new jersey law 
excusing cigarettes from the riskutility theory of liability that 
is whether a products risk outweighs its usefulness 
recent state court decisions favor both sides the california 
supreme court last month upheld a 1987 state law barring liability 
suits over inherently unsafe products including cigarettes 
a month earlier the minnesota supreme court found that warning 
labels on cigarette packs starting in 1966 do not give tobacco 
companies complete immunity from lawsuits as other courts have held

often derided as a nice place to live but you 
wouldnt want to visit atlanta tries one more time this week to 
amuse conventioneers and capture its soul as underground atlanta 
opens for business again 
seven years after the lights went out ostensibly for good the 
entertainment and shopping playground beneath downtown is set to 
open thursday after a threeyear overhaul under the auspices of the 
rouse co the wizards of american urban reclamation 
in its prime underground atlanta was atlantas answer to the 
french quarter created in old storefronts that were the citys 
heart before a network of bridges over railroad tracks literally 
raised downtown one level 
underground had swinging dixieland loud rock n roll cool 
jazz fine eateries chic watering holes even a shop where 
segregationist restaurateurturnedgovernor lester maddox signed 
autographs and sold souvenirs 
underground opened in 1969 peaked in 1972 was struggling by 
1975 and was gone by 1982 it was eulogized as the victim of crime 
or a perception thereof derelicts subway construction ripoff 
merchants and changing times there were dozens of theories about 
what went wrong but seemingly no answers 
without it downtown atlanta has acquired the reputation of a 
ghost town after dark which has been an albatross around the neck 
of the citys thriving convention industry while conventioneers sit 
in gleaming downtown hotels real atlantans are miles away in the 
biracial citys largely white suburbs 
in 1985 the city signed the deal for a 142 million 
rerevitalization it turned to rouse the people responsible for 
bostons faneuil hall market place baltimores harborplace new 
yorks south street seaport among other projects 
were trying to create a town center for metropolitan atlanta 
back to the birthplace of atlanta said joseph g martin jr 
president of the underground atlanta development company we want 
it to be a place where visitors will come to find out about what 
atlanta has to offer but where also the hometown crowd can feel 
some sense of identity 
mayor andrew young sees the new underground as one of the most 
significant accomplishments of two terms in office this 
represents a new heart for atlanta it represents a gathering place 
for the entire metro area 
the new underground is on and around the original site on 
downtowns south side just blocks from the highrise hotel 
district its three times the size of the old underground visitors 
will find 22 restaurants and nightclubs and nearly 100 retailers 
while the emphasis on retailing marks a change for underground the 
entertainment focus is something new for rouse 
weve never done this strong an entertainment aspect to any of 
our urban places said william m coleman vice president and 
general manager of rouseatlanta the rouse affiliate created to run 
the project 
some of that is due to the name he said underground 
atlanta has probably the highest name recognition of any project 
weve ever touched and what underground atlanta was known for 
was entertainment 
rouse officials anticipate 10 million to 11 million visitors a 
year half of them outoftowners they say there are enough office 
workers and conventiongoers downtown to meet threefourths of 
undergrounds needs 
even so martin said the real test of whether the project 
succeeds is whether the project appeals to residents the 
obvious concern what a lot of people talk about around here is 
security 
thats because the old underground came to be regarded as 
dangerous 
dante stephensen whose dantes down the hatch jazz club and 
restaurant anchored the old underground said at its worst 
underground had a lower crime rate than lenox square a popular 
mall but downtown areas cant protect themselves from bad 
publicity 
clearly this time around underground must be perceived as safe 
weve taken a commonsense approach martin said a squad of 
some 30 private guards will patrol accompanied by atlanta police 
who are building a 34officer substation there planners have made 
sure there are no blind alleys and lighting designers have made it 
bright enough to read at midnight 
martin admits to being irked that he is repeatedly asked what 
underground will do to keep out undesirables first tell me 
who the undesirables are this is a town center its open to 
everyone if a person comes to underground and happens to look 
different thats fine if a person starts to infringe on somebody 
elses rights thats not fine 
a nononsense security policy seems to have wide public appeal 
where city officials triggered a storm of criticism with a plan to 
run vagrants out before last years democratic national convention 
hardly anything has been heard from anyone concerned about 
loiterers civil rights in underground 
i dont see it as a problem coleman said the biggest 
problem is in perception and that perception problem goes away as 
people come here and have a good time and find out they arent 
hassled 
i would be surprised martin said if underground is not 
the safest place in the whole atlanta area 
it had better be the city has sunk more than 80 million in 
revenue bonds as well as other public funding into underground if 
it flops the city could be forced to cough up some 3 million a 
year for 30 years 
underground is important symbolically and it is a test of 
whether a town center can work here whether we have enough 
cohesiveness martin said because if we continue to drift 
apart as weve been doing there could be all sorts of consequences 
economic political social and otherwise 
and although rouse has relatively little capital invested the 
companys track record is on the line it seems that each year 
the expectations get higher as they see whats happened in other 
cities coleman said 
rouse has taken slums and turned them into landmarks said 
stephenson who is reopening dantes and underground atlanta was 
never as bad at its worst as any of those other areas were 
project officials maintain theres virtually no way underground 
will fail 
im convinced underground is going to be a great success 
martin said pointing out that while two developers put together the 
first underground on a shoestring this time the city is landlord 
partner and major investor 
the city leaders recognize how important it is and theyre not 
going to let it fail he said they just cant

thousands of coal miners refused to show 
up for work today across southern west virginia after the head of 
the united mine workers told cheering supporters that its time 
for labor to rise up and fight back 
a rally sunday drew 12000 people outside the state capitol to 
call attention to umws 2monthold strike against the pittston coal 
group this morning several other mining companies reported 
walkouts 
gary white president of the west virginia coal association an 
industry group estimated that a third of the states 30000 miners 
stayed home today most of them in the southern part of the state 
there was no evidence the walkouts affected operations in other 
states 
in his speech to the rally sunday umw president richard trumka 
had pledged to widen the umws strike against pittston but there 
was no answer early this morning at the umws headquarters in 
washington or at the home of union spokesman joe corcoran 
its time for labor to rise up and fight bak trumka told 
protesters the 1990s will see us resisting like we did in the 
60s in the streets in the hallways in the corridors of power 
david todd a spokesman for hobet mining in madison said union 
miners did not report for work beginning with the midnight shift 
the walkout at hobet probably is related to the pittston strike he 
said because his company has no pending disputes with the union 
hobet employs nearly 500 miners 
we have no picketers and no direct communications todd said 
beyond that they have given us no notice that this is a memorial 
period 
miners are allowed a 10day memorial period to stop work and 
air grievances under the 1988 bituminous coal operators agreement 
which covers hobet and most other coal companies but not pittston 
among the mines reporting no workers this morning were omar 
mining in laurel creek where 100 miners are employed and kess 
coals in whitesville which reported 55 miners out 
were here available for work whenever the men come out said 
troy wills a supervisor at kess 
about 1600 pittston miners in virginia and west virginia walked 
off the job in april over wage benefit and rule disputes after 
working for more than a year without a contract 
the strike has slowed pittstons production in virginia and all 
but halted pittston mining in west virginia 
miners blocking roads at virginia picket sites have landed more 
than 2000 union members and supporters in jail and resulted in 
millions of dollars in courtordered fines against the union whose 
strike fund and liquid assets are dwindling 
the rally culminated a sixday march by miners through southern 
west virginia 
trumka had refused to elaborate sunday on his threat to expand 
the strike but left open the possibility of taking the walkout to 
other parts of the country including kentucky where about 200 
pittston miners remain on the job 
our government stands up and fights for freedom in poland and 
china said trumka who led supporters to the capitol in the final 
leg of the march 
where are the cries of protest when its an american worker 
having his or her rights trampled 
west virginia gov gaston caperton made an unscheduled appearance 
at the rally urging a compromise solution to the strike 
the question before us is not who will win but how all can 
win said caperton who was endorsed by the united mine workers in 
last years election 
the rally included appearances by leaders of striking eastern 
airlines employees and more than a dozen other local and national 
unions the grounds of the capitol were turned into a sea of 
camouflage green the color of the uniform adopted by strikers

after three years of highly publicized 
investigations arrests leaks innuendo trials and mistrials the 
government finally scored a courtroom victory in a securities fraud 
case 
the conviction friday of corporate raider paul a bilzerian 
whose bushy mustache and bargain basement suits belied his business 
world clout marked a number of firsts in a threeyear federal 
crackdown on wall street crime 
it was the first guilty verdict delivered by a jury in a case 
centering on criminal securities fraud charges 
it was the first time stock parking in which parties try to 
conceal the sale or transfer of securities was prosecuted as a 
felony 
it was the first time information spun off from the ivan boesky 
insider trading scandal via los angeles stockbroker turned 
government informant boyd l jefferies yielded a conviction 
we will continue to prosecute any case thats appropriate to 
prosecute and if that includes parking violations then so be it 
said us attorney benito romano 
wall street lawyers said the swift conviction the bilzerian 
jury deliberated just eight hours should buoy the government in a 
series of scheduled trials including the racketeering and fraud 
case against bond mogul michael milken 
it does give them some momentum and embolden them to continue 
other prosecutions said a new york securities defense lawyer who 
asked not to be identified 
the government was stymied earlier this year with two mistrials 
in its other top case at us district court in manhattan the stock 
manipulation and wire fraud trial of gaf corp and a top executive 
a jury deliberated 12 days before the second mistrial was declared 
the fact of the matter is it just shows that the gaf case was 
an aberration and that it bodes ill for milken and that ilk going 
forward in the future the securities attorney said 
defense lawyers believed the bilzerian jury could have gotten 
lost in a morass of details it couldnt grasp which has long been a 
fear of the government in prosecuting complex stock marketrelated 
frauds 
but courtroom observers said the government presented a strong 
case and that bilzerian testifying in his own defense failed to 
exonerate himself by admitting he supplied misleading information to 
the securities and exchange commission 
the 38yearold singer co chairman and corporate takeover 
specialist was found guilty on nine counts of breaking securities 
and tax laws and making false statements in connection with three 
failed takeovers and one other transaction in 1985 and 86 he faces 
up to 45 years in jail and 225 million in fines 
the conviction on the stock parking charges broke new legal 
ground attorneys said parking typically done to dodge tax or 
disclosure laws is not defined anywhere as a crime but is lumped 
with other actions that may be used to violate federal securities 
laws 
many defense lawyers had argued that the government was 
stretching the law by seeking to prosecute the activity criminally 
the jurys verdict proved them wrong 
it certainly removes any illusion that parking is an inncocuous 
activity said sam scott miller a new york securities lawyer 
it does underline that parking activities will be viewed very 
seriously by federal regulators and they can make it stick 
parking violations are included in the civil and criminal cases 
against drexel burnham lambert inc and the racketeering and fraud 
indictments of princetonnewport partners lp and drexel financier 
milken 
i still believe that despite the conviction it was not the kind 
of case that should have been prosecuted criminally securities 
defense lawyer stanley arkin said i certainly hope its not a 
precedent 
finally the conviction marked success in a case derived from the 
snowballing information provided by boesky who paid 100 million to 
settle insider trading charges in 1986 and named names 
boesky had told government prosecutors about jefferies whose 
testimony was central to the gaf trial but was contradicted several 
times in the bilzerian case he was viewed as more credible 
jefferies is to testify in the gaf retrial and another fraud case 
later this year 
the governments only other victory in a case tied to the wall 
street scandals was the perjury conviction in march of drexel 
assistant bond trader lisa jones who lied during the 
princetonnewport inquest but wasnt charged with violating 
securities laws

we want to push our economic reforms forward chen yuan 
deputy governor of the bank of china said at a meeting of the bank 
of international settlements 
it is a very urgent task for us that we see the economic and 
political situation stabilize

impact of the strife becomes known 
however he acknowledged that the the civil unrest in beijing and 
other major chinese cities already has caused widespread work and 
transportation disruptions increased food prices and led to anxiety 
among western investors and creditors about the prospects for future 
investment in the country

creditors 
i think there is absolutely not a problem in this field we are 
confident the bank of china has a very good reputation with 
foreign creditors he said

billion foreign debt amounted to about 11 percent of chinas foreign 
income

he estimated that retail prices in the first quarter of this year 
rose at an annual rate of more than 20 percent

grain futures prices were mostly higher but corn 
and soybeans mostly lower today on the chicago board of trade 
weather specifically the rain over the weekend was responsible 
for both trends 
the heavy rain in texas oklahoma and the lower midwest delayed 
harvest of the winter wheat crop and helped support prices but the 
same storms reached into the corn and soybean belt of the upper 
midwest and nourished the stilldeveloping crops in iowa illinois 
and indiana 
hanging over the markets head today is a winter wheat production 
report scheduled for release after the close of trading that 
estimate is expected to show this years crop declined by about 8 
percent from last year

the supreme court today rejected appeals by an 
international iron workers union and a local affiliate found to have 
discriminated against black construction workers 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that a union 
training program for granting journeyman status to workers was 
biased against blacks 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last april that the 
international association of bridge structural and ornamental iron 
workers and local 201 in the district of columbia area practiced 
illegal bias 
eight black rodmen construction workers who position steel rods 
to reinforce building materials sued the union in 1975 ten years 
passed before a federal judge issued a ruling that found 
discrimination 
the appeals court upheld key portions of the judges decision 
finding that blacks were victimized by a program that trained 
apprentice workers to become journeymen 
qualifying as a journeyman was crucial for getting work 
particularly in the mid1970s when commercial construction slumped 
in the capital city area 
the appeals court based its finding of discrimination largely on 
statistical evidence that showed the training program had a 
disproportionate impact in denying union admission to blacks 
the black workers said the program created unnecessary barriers 
that delayed or barred them from becoming journeymen even though 
they were qualified 
the parent union and its local argued that the real source of the 
disparity was the higher percentage of blacks who dropped out of the 
training program but the appeals court said union officials failed 
to meet their burden of disproving bias 
absent rebuttal the fact of disproportionately high minority 
dropouts demonstrates the effectiveness of the barrier to union 
membership represented by local 201s educational requirements 
particularly the training program the appeals court said 
it added that the union failed to explain why classroom training 
is essential for becoming a journeyman for those arleady experienced 
and able 
the appeals court noted that for a brief period in 1971 workers 
were allowed to take an exam to qualify as journeymen without 
completing a training program 
that proves that work experience alone can qualify one to be a 
joureyman rodman the appeals court said 
the appeals court ruled that workers with 3000 hours of 
experience may take an exam to become journeymen without undergoing 
any classroom instruction 
the cases are international association of iron workers vs 
berger 88699 and iron workers reinforced rodmen vs berger 
88820

the supreme court today set aside a federal 
appeals court ruling that usx corp illegally discriminated against 
blacks at a fairless hills pa steel mill 
the justices told the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court 
of appeals to restudy the usx case in light of their decision last 
week making it far more difficult for workers to win some jobbias 
lawsuits 
the appeals court had ruled that usx formerly known as us 
steel corp discriminated against blacks who applied for 
nonskilled production and maintenance jobs at the steel mill 
a federal judge in 1983 ordered usx to end all discrimination in 
the hiring of production and maintenance employees at the fairless 
hills mill and awarded more than 123 million to those represented 
by a class action suit 
the judge ruled that statistics showing the disparity between the 
percentages of black applicants and black hires proved that usx 
violated a federal antibias law known as title vii of the civil 
rights act of 1964 but the judge said intentional discrimination 
had not been proved 
the 3rd circuit court in considering the ensuing crossappeals 
ruled that both a title vii violation and intentional discrimination 
had been proved 
the appeals court also ordered the trial judge to reconsider the 
monetary award in a way usx lawyers said could raise the award to 
the range of 30 million 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for usx said the 3rd 
circuit court ruling means an employers only protection against 
title vii liability is to adopt a quota system 
a very similar rationale was cited by the supreme court last week 
when the justices in a major civil rights decision split 54 in 
strengthening employers defenses against charges of bias 
the fairless hills mill where 7000 to 10000 workers are 
employed at a given time hired 5516 people including 977 blacks 
to production and maintenance jobs in the years 197182 
in those years blacks represented 259 percent of the applicants 
and 176 percent of the hires hiring was based on many subjective 
criteria 
the appeals court said statistical studies showed that usxs 
hiring practice had a statistically significant adverse impact upon 
blacks 
after finding that usx had no valid reason for the statistical 
disparity the appeals court ruled that the corporation also had 
practiced intentional discrimination 
the case is usx vs green 88141

as the dollar has surged upward in foreign 
exchange of late many people in the financial world have been 
cheering it on 
if there were no emotions involved their response might well be 
less exuberant many economists are busy right now drawing up lists 
of the hazards as well as the benefits that a rising dollar poses 
for instance a prospective loss of competitive edge in the global 
marketplace 
but there are emotions involved a nations currency in many ways 
symbolizes its strength or weakness and the confidence or lack of 
confidence that its people might be entitled to feel 
some observers also hail the dollars gains as tangible evidence 
that rival ideas specifically communism to the united states 
capitalist system are being put to flight 
lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the 
capitalist system was to debauch the currency the eminent 
economist john maynard keynes wrote in 1931 
by a continuing process of inflation governments can 
confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth 
of their citizenslenin was certainly right 
in the last 25 years or so american currency has taken a lot of 
punches though it has evaded any knockout blows it certainly has 
been bruised 
a penny saved is no longer a penny earned in the late 1980s a 
penny saved is pointless 
even if inflation in this country remains at only 5 percent 
the wall street journal notes in less than three decades a dollar 
will have shrunk to a quarter in purchasing power 
nevertheless such scary images pale beside the economic 
nightmare now unfolding in argentina 
that nations inflation rate is projected at something like 
12000 percent this year propelling it to the brink of calamity 
our money is worthless a worker at the national mint told a new 
york times reporter 
the dollars strong showing and argentinas woes have provided a 
new platform for monetarism a school of economic thought that 
emphasizes the importance of the amount of money circulating through 
the system 
inflation monetarists contend is not caused by droughts or oil 
embargoes or other such events it results from too much growth in 
the supply of money 
if a country like argentina didnt exist monetarists would 
have to invent it just to have a laboratory in which to prove their 
theories says norman fosback editor of the financial advisory 
letter market logic in fort lauderdale fla 
in the last 14 years the us money supply expanded about 
3fold argentinas money supply by comparison expanded more than 
3 millionfold in the same period 
over the last year by some measures money supply growth as 
managed by the federal reserve in this country has been virtually 
nil to some observers that and the dollars recent rise mean an 
increasing risk of recession 
the coming downturn will be exacerbated by the federal 
reserves supertight monetary policy contends erich heinemann 
chief economist at the investment firm of ladenburg thalmann amp co 
with a continued rise in the dollar heinemann says the growth 
of exports should slow to a crawl the more the dollar goes up the 
bigger the risk the us will slide into a recession 
but fosback for one doesnt agree in stark contrast to the 
argentinian example he says we think recent careful control of 
us money supply will soon be reflected in declining inflation and 
enhanced longterm prosperity

grain futures prices were mostly higher while 
corn and soybeans were mixed to mostly lower monday on the chicago 
board of trade 
weather the dominant feature in the market was behind both 
trends but the us agriculture departments monthly crop estimate 
on winter wheat production also had some effect 
the report scheduled for release after the close of trading was 
expected to show this years crop declined by about 8 percent from 
last year 
nobody figured the change would be a major one but it still 
made people want to square up their positions before it came out 
said ted mao an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new 
york 
heavy rain in texas oklahoma and the lower midwest delayed 
harvest of the winter wheat crop and helped support prices 
throughout the day 
but the same storms reached into the corn and soybean belt of the 
upper midwest and nourished the stilldeveloping crops in iowa 
illinois and indiana and with prices sliding for nearly four weeks 
several of the oldcrop months in beans touched new contract lows 
on the close wheat was 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 388 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 4 cents higher with july at 249 a bushel oats

sen john glenn has warned the bush 
administration that the possible sale to china of millions of 
dollars worth of surplus equipment from a closed nuclear plant could 
violate a congressional resolution 
glenn dohio said the sale even without the actual reactor from 
the washington public power supply system plant would be worth 500 
million 
he warned that such a deal would violate a 1985 resolution 
barring the sale of us reactors or fuel to china until the 
president had certified that china would abide by various nuclear 
nonproliferation pacts 
glenn in a letter to commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
obtained monday said if such a deal was approved it would 
represent an extremely inauspicious beginning for the new 
administration in the field of nuclear nonproliferation 
a staff member of the senate governmental affairs committee 
which glenn chairs said the commerce department subsequently told 
the senator it would not issue any export licenses for the sale 
until after consulting with the nuclear regulatory commission 
we have been told by commerce they would withhold any further 
action until they hear from the nrc said the staffer who asked 
not to be named 
a spokesman for the commerce departments bureau of export 
administration declined immediate comment 
a spokesman for the supply system at its richland wash 
headquarters said wppss has been trying for several years to sell 
equipment from its terminated no 5 plant to the chinese but export 
licenses from the federal government had to be secured first 
spokesman gary petersen said the supply system would like export 
licenses to sell the plants actual reactor 250000 pounds of 
nuclear fuel and what is called the balance of the plant 
including its turbines 
both plants beset with enormous cost overruns and years behind 
schedule were terminated in the early 1980s when new forecasts 
showed the power they would produce wouldnt be needed 
petersen declined to comment on glenns 500 million pricetag for 
the sale 
glenn wrote mosbacher early last month before the chinese 
government cracked down on student protesters

apple computer inc on monday announced 
communications products for its macintosh that analysts said should 
help the company plug more of the machines into fortune 1000 
computer networks 
the new products make it easier for people to use macintosh 
personal computers to get at information stored on equipment made by 
international business machines corp digital equipment corp and 
others 
the bottom line is that these are products that are going to be 
very attractive to large corporations said walter winnitzki an 
analyst at brown brothers harriman amp co 
apple has to overcome a preference among some corporate computer 
managers for buying all their equipment from mainframes to personal 
computers from a single company often ibm it does that by trying 
to convince the managers that apple can plug into big ibm computers 
as easily as ibm itself does 
this begins to put apple into strategic planners eyes said 
jonathan eunice an analyst for dh brown associates inc 
apples strong suit is the popularity of the macintosh itself 
the computers easeofuse features are being imitated by ibm and 
others 
they have lost a fiveyear lead but they retain a twoyear lead 
at least eunice said 
some big corporate customers are reluctant to rely on the 
macintosh because apple is the only company that makes it in 
contrast ibms original personal computer was widely copied and 
ibm has been trying with limited success to encourage controlled 
cloning of its new personal system2 line 
but while apples tight grip on the macintosh is a hindrance in 
some respects apple sees it as an advantage donald casey the vice 
president of networking and communications said in an interview 
we control the whole experience we strongly believe the 
whole is greater than the sum of the parts he said 
apple announced enhancements in the appletalk networking system 
which connects apple computers to each other bridges to other 
networks such as ibms token ring digitals decnet tcpip and open 
systems interconnect and communications tools including cl1 which 
allows macintosh programs to get at data stored on other computers 
the products should appeal to users who want to stick with their 
familiar macintosh commands and still get the power of a network of 
different kinds of computers said win farrell a computer 
consultant at coopers amp lybrand 
time will tell whether the users are sufficiently impressed to 
adopt this he said

the stock market managed a mixed performance in 
light trading today benefiting from an afternoon recovery in blue 
chip issues 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials traded in negative 
territory for much of the session but gradually regained lost ground 
in the afternoon 
wall street analysts attributed todays early weakness to 
continuing interest by investors to collect profits made during the 
recent advance powered by takeover activity 
they said underlying sentiment still seems positive toward the 
market which is why no prolonged substantial selloff developed 
eugene peroni market strategist at janney montgomery scott inc 
attributed the markets overall showing to a normal round of 
profittaking that typically follows an advance and he characterized 
the selling as modest 
im very encouraged by the markets behavior said peroni 
noting that investors may be refraining from significant new buying 
until they have seen convincing evidence of a sustained decline in

a delaware judge reserved decision monday on a 
motion to force prime computer inc to hold its annual meeting this 
month so shareholders can vote on a challenge from hostile bidder 
mai basic four inc 
mai basic argued in chancery court that prime violated state law 
by delaying the annual meeting 
prime based in natick mass originally scheduled the meeting 
for may 12 but postponed it until june 14 and again until july 26

wednesday meeting 
both companies are incorporated in delaware 
mai basic which originally offered 20 per share for prime 
lowered its offer june 1 to 1950 per share the new offer values 
prime at about 975 million down from 13 billion in cash 
mai basic attorney michael goldman said postponement of the

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether manufacturers legally may give some discounts to wholesalers 
but not retailers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by texaco inc ordered to 
pay 135 million in antitrust damages to 12 service stations in the 
spokane wash area 
texacos appeal was supported by leading business groups 
including the national association of manufacturers and the american 
petroleum institute 
the groups said a ruling by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
against texaco threatens to undermine perhaps the most common 
distributional arrangement in american business the dual channel 
system in which a manufacturer or supplier sells to wholesalers at 
discounted prices lower than those it charges direct purchasing 
retailers 
asked by the court for its views the bush administration said 
the texaco appeal should be denied 
justice department lawyers said they were troubled by some of 
the 9th circuit courts opinion but added that the ruling can be 
interpreted narrowly 
the appeals court last march upheld a jury verdict that texaco 
practiced illegal price discrimination in violation of the 
robinsonpatman act a federal antitrust law 
the jury ordered texaco to pay 449900 in damages a sum 
tripled by the judge to 135 million in accord with the antitrust 
law 
sufficient evidence was introduced to support the finding that 
the service stations suffered an antitrust injury and that 
texacos unlawful price discrimination was a material cause of that 
injury the appeals court said in upholding the tripled award 
the 12 service station dealers said that from 1972 to 1981 they 
were placed at an unfair competitive disadvantage because texaco 
supplied gasoline to two spokanearea wholesalers john dompier oil 
co and gull oil co at prices ranging from 25 cents to 575 cents 
per gallon less than texaco charged retailers 
dompier sold the gasoline to retailers under the texaco 
trademark gull marketed it under private brand names 
the 12 service stations who sued texaco said they suffered 
because at least part of the discounts were passed on to consumers 
by competing retailers who bought from dompier and gull 
texaco argued that the discounts were legitimate since they were 
available to all wholesalers who purchased from texaco 
but the 9th circuit court said there was evidence that the 
services offered by gull and dompier were insubstantial and did 
not justify the functional discount they received from texaco 
for example the appeals court said there was evidence that 
gulls role as a middleman amounted only to engaging in paper 
transactions and texaco delivered gasoline directly to dompiers 
customers in some instances 
the case is texaco vs hasbrouck 872048

the supreme court gave a mixed response to 
three unrelated job discriminationcomplaint cases monday ruling 
favorably for employers in two of them and vindicating alleged bias 
victims in the third 
the court set aside a lowercourt ruling that usx corp illegally 
discriminated against blacks at a steel mill and in a separate case 
it limited deadlines for filing some lawsuits that accuse employers 
of illegal sex bias but the court rejected appeals by an iron 
workers union found to have discriminated against blacks 
in the usx case the justices told the philadelphiabased 3rd 
us circuit court of appeals to restudy it in light of their 
decision last week making it far more difficult for workers to win 
some jobbias lawsuits 
the appeals court had ruled that usx formerly known as us 
steel corp discriminated against blacks who applied for 
nonskilled production and maintenance jobs at the steel mill 
a federal judge in 1983 ordered usx to end discrimination in the 
hiring of production and maintenance employees at the fairless 
hills pa steel mill and awarded more than 123 million to those 
represented by a class action suit 
the judge ruled that statistics showing the disparity between the 
percentages of black applicants and black hires proved that usx 
violated a federal antibias law known as title vii of the civil 
rights act of 1964 but the judge said intentional discrimination 
had not been proved 
the 3rd circuit court in considering the ensuing crossappeals 
ruled that both a title vii violation and intentional discrimination 
had been proved 
in the appeal acted on monday lawyers for usx said the 3rd 
circuit court ruling means an employers only protection against 
title vii liability is to adopt a quota system 
the supreme court cited a similar rationale last week when the 
justices in a major civil rights decision split 54 in 
strengthening employers defenses against charges of bias 
in a second jobdiscrimination case the court on monday threw 
out a suit by three women who said a change in the seniority system 
at an atampt plant in illinois discriminated against them 
the court said the women waited too long to sue 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said the women had 
300 days to sue from the time the seniority system change was 
adopted not 300 days from the time they were affected personally 
by the new seniority rules 
in a dissenting opinion justice thurgood marshall said the 
ruling shields acts of intentional discrimination 
the case involves patricia a lorance janice m king and carol 
s bueschen employees in atampts montgomery works in aurora ill 
in the third discrimination case the court let stand a ruling 
that an ironworkers union training program for granting journeyman 
status to workers was biased against blacks 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington ruled last april 
that the international association of bridge structural and 
ornamental iron workers and local 201 in the district of columbia 
area practiced illegal bias 
eight black rodmen construction workers who position steel rods 
to reinforce building materials sued the union in 1975 ten years 
passed before a federal judge issued a ruling that found 
discrimination 
the appeals court upheld key portions of the judges decision 
finding that blacks were victimized by a program that trained 
apprentice workers to become journeymen 
in other cases monday the supreme court 
ruled that state taxes may be imposed when bankrupt companies 
sell assets by a 63 vote in a california case the justices said 
the taxes may be imposed on such sales and on a buyers subsequent 
use of the assets when bankrupt companies are ordered to liquidate 
refused to let companies involved in treating hazardous waste 
sue for stricter standards that could increase their business volume 
or give them a competitive advantage over other wastetreatment 
companies 
made it easier to recover lawyers fees for people who win 
disputes with the government over social security benefits the 
court said the government must reimburse legal fees incurred during 
proceedings that a federal court has ordered the department of 
health and human services to conduct 
agreed to consider reinstating a 61 million award against the 
arthur young amp co accounting firm won by investors in the farmers 
cooperative of arkansas and oklahoma

union pilots at northwest airlines on monday 
threatened to strike if its parent company nwa inc is taken over 
by a buyer who would saddle the carrier with debt 
this letter is to serve notice that our concern for the 
longterm survival and success of northwest airlines must be the 
cornerstone of any new contract leaders of the 5000member air 
line pilots association said in the letter addressed to all bidders 
and the companys board of directors 
excessive debt incurred in connection with any transaction 
involving northwest airlines or nwa inc is something we simply will 
not accept the pilots said in the letter published as an ad in 
the wall street journal we may have no choice except to take 
whatever action we can to ensure the continued growth and prosperity 
of the carrier 
ht dodge and kirk faupel cochairman of the union said a 
pilot strike will be inevitable if their concerns are not resolved 
the pilots are the only union at northwest with an open contract 
about half of the pilots are working under a threeyear agreement 
signed with the old northwest orient in 1983 
the other half are working under terms of a 1984 contract signed 
with republic airlines which northwest acquired in the fall of 
1986 the old republic contract ran out in 1987 
the letter said too much debt would render northwest airlines a 
financially crippled secondtier carrier ill equipped to meet the 
challenges of business cycles the economic and safety demands of 
fleet replacement and the global competitive threat of 
governmentsubsidized foreign megacarriers 
a message to pilots recorded on friday said mediated talks with 
northwest management are scheduled to resume tuesday the message 
said significant progress has been made on a variety of contract 
issues since may 
a second round of bidding for northwest airlines comes to a close 
friday seven bidders representing a range of interests have already 
submitted bids but other offers are possible 
nwa should fetch in excess of 33 billion and perhaps more than 
36 billion based on details of the offers made during the first 
round nwas board has said it may decide to reject all offers

a textile union said monday it plans a joint bid 
with a tennessee businessman for apparel maker cluett peabody amp co 
and threatened that another buyer would risk being at war with 
their own employees 
the amalgamated clothing amp textile workers union said workers 
would not cooperate with another buyer of the company that makes 
arrow shirts now owned by farley inc 
were here to put on notice other potential bidders and the 
lenders for these bidders that we are unequivocally opposed to any 
bids other than by the employees said garry ferraris an actwu 
vice president 
he said the union has joined with nashville tenn businessman 
spencer hays a publisher who owns several clothing businesses to 
prepare an offer for cluett 
preliminary plans call for a leveraged buyout with hays putting 
up most of the cash and employees retaining about 30 percent of the 
stock and a voice in major decisions affecting the compan he said 
chicagobased farley reportedly want to sells cluett to help 
erase some of the debt associated with its 3 billion acquisition of 
west point gabased westpoint pepperell inc earlier this year 
farley spokesman jack albertine was traveling monday and could 
not be reached for comment 
jay meltzer a textile industry analyst with goldman sachs amp co 
in new york said the unions action was unusual but should not 
deter other potential bidders 
ferraris said employees are opposed to other bidders because 
cluett has changed hands twice in the last four years it was 
acquired by westpoint pepperell in 1985 and switched again in the 
farley deal 
ferraris said employees do not feel secure and a new owner could 
shift cluett jobs overseas ferraris said about five potential 
bidders exist for cluett including the shirt manufacturer 
phillipsvan heusen 
the value of a union offer has not been determined ferraris 
said dale allen an actwu leader said the company has been valued 
as high as 800 million 
ferraris said union leaders discussed their plans with farley 
chairman william farley he said farley indicated he wanted to allow 
several parties to bid on cluett 
cluett also manufactures gold toe socks and j schoeneman suits 
its factories in georgia alabama maryland north carolina 
pennsylvania and delaware employ more than 8000 people

traders in asia and europe drove the dollar to 
longtime highs against major foreign currencies on monday 
increasing american buying power but further jeopardizing progress 
on cutting the us trade deficit 
the dollar reached a 22month high against the japanese yen in 
tokyo and a 30month high against the west german mark in europe 
before retreating slightly in us trading 
gold prices recovered somewhat in us trading after fridays 
steep plunge which knocked prices down as much as 15 a troy ounce 
dealers cited several factors in the dollar rally including the 
image of the united states as a safe haven from political 
uncertainty but said market sentiment was the main force 
this is not all psychological although a good chunk of it is 
psychological said donald fine chief market analyst at chase 
manhattan bank 
the dollar rally could harm the us economy as soon as the end 
of the year by prompting companies to cut back on their spending on 
new plants and equipment fine said 
the companies would cut back he said out of a belief that the 
strength of the dollar would reduce their ability to compete with 
foreign manufacturers although it is too soon to see such effects 
yet 
there were rumors that the federal reserve sold dollars in new 
york trading in an attempt to restrain the us currency but the 
supposed action had little effect 
the bank of canada intervened in europe but no other central 
banks were sighted dealers there said 
the latest phase of the dollars climb gained strength friday on 
news of an unexpectedly large 09 percent increase in us producer 
prices in may that strengthened expectations us monetary policy 
would remain tight for some time sustaining high interest rates 
that support demand for dollars 
as far as im concerned this dollar is in a definite uptrend

up to 10000 coal miners walked off the job 
monday in southern west virginia and threatened to take the wildcat 
strike nationwide 
the walkout followed a rally sunday at which united mine workers 
president richard trumka told miners to rise up and fight back 
in support of 1600 miners on strike in west virginia and virginia 
against pittston coal group inc 
in the pittston strike a judge in virginia has jailed three 
union leaders and fined the union more than 3 million for violating 
a ban on mass picketing 
theyre protesting the excessive fines and the jailing of the 
three union officers down in virginia said dave evans a pittston 
miner theyre going to try to shut down all the union and 
nonunion mines by the end of next week youll see a nationwide and 
canadian strike whatever it takes to get this settled 
mondays strikes spread throughout umw district 17 which has 
8000 members in southern west virginia 
gary white president of the west virginia coal association 
estimated more than 10000 miners refused to show up for work 
under their 1988 contract the miners can take a 10day 
memorial period and walk off the job to air grievances but must 
give notice beforehand 
none of the coal companies struck monday said they were informed 
that this would be a 10day work stoppage 
west virginias largest coal field employer consolidation coal 
immediately obtained a backtowork order from us district judge 
dennis knapp the order is effective until june 22 when another 
hearing is scheduled 
consol argued that when the 250 of its 4000 workers walked out 
they violated a 1988 contract barring strikes and that the walkout 
could keep the company from meeting contracts the umw did not send 
attorneys to the hearing 
in past wildcat strikes the first shift out was the first shift 
back it that were to hold true in this case consol workers would 
return at midnight monday 
pittston miners struck april 5 after working more than 14 months 
without a contract pittston had refused to sign the 1988 bituminous 
coal operators association agreement the contract which most other 
coal companies signed 
during the pittston walkout more than 2200 miners retirees and 
their wives have been arrested for acts of civil disobedience such 
as blocking coal trucks 
peabody coal the nations top coal producer had 2360 union 
miners walk out at midnight said tom clarke a peabody attorney 
no reason for the unauthorized work stoppage has been 
communicated to managament clarke said according to peabody 
policy no discussions will be held with the miners until they have 
returned to work 
roger caldwell a umw leader said sundays crowd was whipped 
up by trumka 
top union leaders did not immediately return calls monday 
trumka could not be reached at umw headquarters in washington or 
in charleston where he led the 12000miner rally on the capitol 
steps sunday 
its time for labor to rise up and fight back trumka said at 
the rally the 1990s will see us resisting like we did in the 
60s in the streets in the hallways in the corridors of power

coffee futures prices plunged monday after producers and 
consumers failed to negotiate new export quotas and pricing levels 
or to extend a current agreement 
on other markets cotton futures continued to rebound from last 
weeks losses tied to political unrest in china and petroleum 
futures were down amid fears that dissension within opec will mean 
more oil at cheaper prices 
the worlds leading coffee producers and consumers extended their 
meeting in london through the weekend in an attempt to reach a new 
agreement to replace one that expires oct 1 
the major stumbling block is a request by the largest consumers 
notably the united states and europe to end a twotier system 
allowing exporting countries to sell the commodity to nonmembers of 
the international coffeee organization at prices below what ico 
members pay 
there was pressure from the opening bell and it got stronger as 
time went on and it became more apparent that no agreement was in 
the offing said kim badenhop of merrill lynch capital markets 
inc in new york 
coffee settled 375 cents to 623 cents lower on the new york 
coffee sugar and cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery in 
july at 12484 cents 
contracts for three of the four deferred months closed down the 
6cent daily trading limit the 623cent loss was for september 
contracts which have no limit 
cotton futures hit the daily limit as well but on the upside 
cotton settled 190 cents to 2 cents higher with july at 6695 
cents a pound on the new york cotton exchange 
we had some severe weather regarding the crop in the field but 
the climb was more a continuation from the support lines we put down 
last week during the events in china said ed whitten of balfour 
maclaine corp in new york 
crude oil futures led the products in a downturn at the new york 
mercantile exchange 
ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
meeting last week in vienna agreed to raise the cartels daily 
output from 185 million barrels per day to 195 million although 
most analysts say opec members already were producing closer to 21 
million 
kuwaits official quota before the meeting was 1037 million 
barrels per day and was increased to 1093 million analysts said 
kuwaits actual production was more than 2 million 
several of the nations leaders were quoted monday saying kuwait 
will maintain that level a signal that opec will be unable to 
restrict production levels even to 195 million barrels per day for 
the cartel 
then theres the question of will they be cheating more with 
higher quotas or just the same said peter beutel of elders 
futures inc in new york does this mean 21 million or something 
closer to 22 million 
crude oil settled 42 cents to 63 cents lower with july at 1926 
a barrel heating oil was 158 cents to 179 cents lower with july 
at 4545 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 185 cents to 2 
cents lower with july at 6173 cents a gallon 
grain futures prices were mostly higher but corn and soybeans 
mixed to mostly lower on the chicago board of trade 
weather the dominant feature in the market was behind both 
trends 
heavy rain in texas oklahoma and the lower midwest delayed 
harvest of the winter wheat crop and helped support prices 
throughout the day 
but the same storms reached into the corn and soybean belt of the 
upper midwest and nourished the stilldeveloping crops in iowa 
illinois and indiana 
on the close wheat was 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 388 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 4 cents higher with july at 249 a bushel oats 
were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with july at 158 cents a bushel 
and soybeans were 8 cents to 11 cents lower with july at 694 a 
bushel 
gold and silver both climbed at the comex after a steep drop last 
friday gold settled 380 to 450 higher with june at 36190 a 
troy ounce silver was 31 cents to 4 cents higher with june at 
5202 cents a troy ounce 
livestock and pork futures were higher on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
live cattle were unchanged to 80 cent higher with june at 7022 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 50 cent to 73 cent higher with 
august at 8067 cents a pound live hogs were 02 cent to 30 cent 
higher with june at 4820 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies 
were unchanged to 165 cents higher with july at 3360 cents a 
pound

the commerce department withdrew an export 
license for the sale of 500 million in nuclear power plant parts to 
china after the nuclear regulatory commission and sen john glenn 
protested officials said monday 
we viewed it initially as an attempt to circumvent the law 
said leonard weiss staff director of the senate committee on 
governmental affairs we discovered the state department wasnt 
even aware of this export 
glenn chairman of the committee complained in a letter to 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher that the shipment would 
undercut a 1985 congressional resolution forbidding such sales 
unless the president certified that china is not helping other 
nations build nuclear weapons 
the ohio democrat has been a frequent critic of what he calls 
chinas clandestine trade in nuclearrelated materials with third 
world countries particularly pakistan and nations in the middle 
east 
all of the equipment nonreactor items such as compressors 
pipes turbine generators and other electrical gear was from a 
canceled power plant at satsop wash the plant belongs to the 
washington public power supply system a consortium of publicly 
owned local utilities 
all of the licensing events occurred in may before the chinese 
governments crackdown on student demonstrators in beijing 
wppss spokesman gary petersen said the consortium still wants to 
sell the equipment to china 
we knew all this unrest in china would delay things petersen 
said but it doesnt stop it 
wppss also sought licenses from the nrc and the state department 
to sell the plants reactor and 250000 pounds of enriched uranium 
fuel to china 
the nrc rejected those requests earlier this year because neither 
president bush nor president reagan had certified that china is 
abiding by nuclear nonproliferation safeguards 
while the nrc is in charge of issuing export licenses for 
reactors and nuclear fuel the commerce deparment has export 
licensing authority for all nonnuclear electric power plant 
components 
however such licenses normally are not approved by either until 
after interagency consultations among the nrc the us arms control 
and disarmament agency and the state commerce and energy 
departments 
because the nonnuclear components are so coupled with the 
particular model of reactor at the wppss plant the export licenses 
for each make sense only if they are coordinated said harold 
denton director of the nrcs office of governmental and public 
affairs 
he said the commerce department license was issued in early may 
without consulting with us 
it was withdrawn two weeks later when the nrc found out about it 
it sounds to me like it was an oversight on their part because 
normally they do consult with us denton said about the commerce 
department in this case they didnt but theyve corrected 
that 
the commerce department has agreed to condition any license for 
the export of nonnuclear components to nrc approval of the reactor 
sale 
weiss said commerce deparment officials originally contended that 
a nonproliferation declaration from bush was not needed because the 
license was only for nonnuclear components however weiss said 
mosbacher later told glenn that the deal was being deferred until 
after consultations with the nrc 
a commerce official speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
the department had no basis for denying the license because the 
export was general nonnuclear industrial equipment 
the nrc and the state department both had action on this and 
none of it was going to go forward unless all three approved said 
the official and we knew it was highly unlikely that the nrc was 
going to approve it

federal agents are investigating 
northrop corps defense systems division here for possible 
overcharging on military contracts according to a published report 
company spokeswoman maria oharenko acknowledged the probe but 
would not reveal its focus 
we are aware of a government investigation and company 
documents were subpoenaed she said we are working with the 
government on the document request 
agents from the us attorneys office visited the defense 
systems division in this chicago suburb last week seeking documents 
related to the probe she told the daily herald in arlington heights 
the newspaper reported last weekend that the probe involves 
accusations that northrop improperly billed the government for 
defense work 
unidentified sources within the defense systems division told the 
paper they believe the probe centers on allegations that the 
government was overcharged for labor and materials under certain 
contracts 
the investigation comes as parent northrop corp in los angeles 
faces a 167count criminal indictment charging it supplied defective 
parts and falsified test results on critical components of air force 
cruise missles and navy av8b harrier jets 
ms oharenko said the local investigation is not related to that 
criminal indictment 
the defense systems division which makes radarjamming equipment 
for military aircraft employs about 4000 people at its 
headquarters in rolling meadows and two other facilities in nearby 
arlington heights and elk grove village 
the division produces systems to shield b52 and b1b bombers and 
f15 fighter jets from detection by enemy radar it has suffered 
from cutbacks in military spending and over the past year and has 
reduced its work force by more than 1000 people through layoffs and 
attrition

automakers said monday they could develop 
methanolfueled vehicles to meet president bushs cleanair 
proposals but wonder if people are likely to buy them 
some practical hurdles the big three automakers cited including 
making the fuel available making methanolpowered engines start 
better in cold weather and cutting their formaldehyde emissions 
the cars can be made said kelly brown ford motor cos 
executive engineer in charge of fuel economy and emissions but 
its another thing to sell them 
some people when new technology comes out want to be first on 
board and some want to sit back and wait and see how everyone else 
does with it those are the ones were worried about 
bush called on congress in a white house speech monday to require 
automakers to put 500000 alternativefuel vehicles in operation in 
nine highsmog urban areas by 1996 and 1 million such vehicles a 
year after that 
unlike gasoline methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes smog 
problems in nearly 100 metropolitan areas 
bush also proposed cutting tailpipe emissions from automobiles by 
40 percent and curbing other automobile fuelrelated pollutants 
environmental protection agency administrator william k reilly 
said bushs proposals to cut acid rain and industrial and automotive 
smog would let all but the most severely polluted areas los 
angeles houston and new york city meet federal air quality 
standards by the year 2000 
it is a tough proposal but it does take into account some of 
the technical difficulties we would face in meeting it said 
harold a poling fords vice chairman and chief operating officer 
any tighter standards probably would be unattainable and would 
bring little improvement in air quality poling said 
ford favors a pilot program to resolve technical questions before 
trying to switch to alternative fuel vehicles he said 
william h noack a general motors corp spokesman in washington 
said gm also favors a pilot program 
noack said details will have to be fleshed out in ensuing 
legislation and regulations just generally speaking as you look 
at the proposal there is a good deal of flexibility in there he 
said 
at ford brown said engineers are trying to improve cold starting 
of methanol engines and cut formaldehyde emissions which are about 
four times as high as from a gasoline engine 
chrysler corp questioned the speed of the program in a statement 
issued by spokeswoman karen stewart for example it is not clear 
how an abundant supply of alternate fuels will be produced and 
distributed at prices attractive to the consumer she said 
chrysler spokesman ben dunn said his company will deliver 10 
vehicles fueled by an 85percent methanol 15percent gasoline mix 
to southern california later this year for two years of tests in 
fleet use 
dunn said methanol vehicles need larger tanks for the same travel 
range as gasoline vehicles and it remains unclear if methanol will 
have corrosive effects on fuel system components in the long run
