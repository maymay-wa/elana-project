president reagan will recommend that the 
almostcomplete us embassy in moscow be destroyed and rebuilt 
because of fears it contains sophisticated eavesdropping devices 
the washington post reported in its thursday editions 
the newspaper quoted state department sources as saying the 
presidents decision was expected to be announced thursday 
it probably would cost 300 million and take five years to build 
a new eightstory embassy on the same site with materials imported 
from the united states and kept under heavy guard after they arrived 
in the soviet union the paper reported 
state department sources have said that secretary of state george 
shultz recommended the move to reagan 
the reagan administration believes the embassy building which 
was mostly completed by 1985 includes structural elements riddled 
with sophisticated devices that were intended for eavesdropping 
however details on those findings have not been released 
the current plan the post reported is to fabricate the 
buildings main elements in the united states ship them to the 
soviet union keep them under heavy guard and have the building 
assembled by us workers taken to moscow for the construction 
project 
the embassy building originally was to have been completed by 
1983 reagans recommendation would be made to congress and 
officials said they believed lawmakers would insist on a full study 
of the matter congress has adjourned for the year 
state department officials said that while the us embassy is 
being constructed soviet officials in washington will be barred 
from occupying their longcompleted embassy office building

the future is bleak for many children in 
americas cities unless the next president and congress make a 
commitment to solving some of their problems a massachusetts mayor 
said wednesday 
too many children in our cities have no future no future at 
all unless we as a nation act on the problems they face today 
said theodore d mann mayor of newton mass 
mann is chairman of the human development committee of the us 
conference of mayors which on wednesday released a status report 
on children in americas cities 
the report calls attention to our collective failure as a 
nation to respond to these problems mann said of the 52city 
survey of mayors and human service officials 
the study identifies drug abuse weaknesses in education systems 
the lack of affordable child care teenage pregnancy and school 
dropouts as key problems which have grown worse in the last five 
years in 80 percent of the cities surveyed 
officials said lowincome children are confronted with the 
additional problems of homelessness and the lack of access to 
medical and mental health care 
kevin moriarity director of human services for san antonio 
texas recounted some of the surveys gloomier statistics three of 
10 children in the cities surveyed lived in poverty in 1986 one in 
five was on welfare and received food stamps 38 percent dropped out 
of school between the ninth grade and their scheduled high school 
graduation in the class of 1988 15 percent of the babies born in 
1986 were born to teenage mothers and a 126 percent infant 
mortality rate plagued the cities during that year 
among survey cities irvine calif had the lowest overall 
poverty rate and child poverty rate in 1986 at 41 percent and 33 
percent respectively the city with the highest 1986 overall 
poverty rate and child poverty rate was camden nj at 423 
percent and 611 percent respectively 
meanwhile the urban institute released a study based on 1979 
data that showed that 171 percent of us children lived in 
families with income below the poverty level the poverty rate for 
children was 51 percent in sweden and switzerland and 82 percent 
in west germany 
the urban institute study said the high us poverty rate among 
children occurs because programs for the poor cover fewer people and 
provide fewer benefits than programs in other industrialized 
countries officials said the united states relative standing had 
changed little if any since 1979 
mann said the mayors conference was not interested in placing 
blame for the current problems but was calling for a national 
partnership between the business community and federal state and 
local governments 
however most speakers at wednesdays session of the us 
conference of city human service officials an affiliate of the 
mayors conference emphasized increasing the federal governments 
role both financially and in providing policy direction 
weve got to have more federal assistance not just in funding 
but in policy said james moran mayor of alexandria va 
we feel that we have done as much as we can and sometimes 
more moran said we are losing middleclass residents because 
of high property taxes used to pay for needed services he said 
moran said his community a prosperous suburb of washington 
faces a growing problem of homelessness fueled by a high dropout 
rate he cited an 186 percent dropout rate in 1987 among teenage 
girls due to pregnancy 
among the cities surveyed norfolk va had the highest dropout 
rate in the class of 1988 seventyone percent of norfolks 1988 
class left school from the ninth grade and 37 percent of the rest of 
those eligible for graduation in 1988 left in the tenth grade 
but george d raiss a spokesman for the norfolk public schools 
called the groups numbers completely erroneous 
the study did not take into account norfolks transient 
population the city is home to the worlds largest naval facility 
and the study counted as dropouts students who actually 
transferred from one school to another who transferred out of the 
district and those who were not promoted for academic reasons among 
others 
according to figures supplied to the state of virginia norfolk 
had a dropout rate of 81 percent in 1988 which was down from 91 
percent in 1987 and 158 percent in 1981 
the average wait for subsidized child care among surveyed cities 
was almost 10 months while the wait for nonsubsidized child care 
was 18 weeks with costs running an average of 78 weekly at a 
centerbased facility nationally half the children under 6 have 
mothers who work outside the home 
the group did not identify a specific amount they thought was 
needed from the federal government to address childrens problems 
but mann noted that both presidential candidates had emphasized 
childrens issues in their campaigns 
we need to hear more from each of them on a commitment of 
dollars we need to hear that they are willing to make the enormous 
investment that the problems demand and the children deserve 
mann added

two whales trapped for nearly three weeks 
in the arctic ice pack were freed wednesday by soviet and american 
icebreakers superpower saviors who hacked a path to the open sea 
the whales are loose and in the channel and headed out said 
lt mike haller a spokesman for the alaska national guard they 
looked good all afternoon to look at them youd have thought they 
had their bags packed and were ready to head south 
theyre in the main lead and i cant help but think theyll 
keep on truckin i dont know how much more we can do said 
rescue coordinator ron morris of the us national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration 
the work to free the migrating california gray whales progressed 
rapidly tuesday when two soviet icebreaking vessels began smashing 
the ice that kept the pair imprisoned a third trapped whale is 
believed to have died last week 
morris who followed the whales by helicopter landed a little 
after 4 pm 9 pm edt to report that the whales had moved from 
the final manmade breathing hole to the slushy path the soviet 
icebreaker vladimir arseniev cut tuesday night 
rescue officials were worried that the whales would have trouble 
breaking air holes through the partly frozen cut but around 430 
pm rescue workers found the two whales had opened a small 
breathing hole and were sharing it 
one of the whales was bleeding enough to stain the water red 
spectators watched anxiously for several moments waiting for the 
whales to surface in the new waterway cut wednesday by the arseniev 
and cheered joyously when the whales broke the surface 
as darkness fell the whales were swimming back and forth in the 
channel officials halted helicopter surveillance at nightfall but 
said they planned to meet thursday and could check whether the 
whales had reached the sea 
the arseniev stayed in the channel wednesday night widening the 
passage to the open sea officials said 
scientists and others involved in the rescue may never know the 
whales fate a lot of people really didnt want to know said 
jim harvey a federal marine biologist after officials decided not 
to put electronic tracking tags on the already stressed animals 
haller said plans were being made in barrow to thank the soviets 
with a party but soviet officers said they would wait until it was 
clear the whales were in the open sea before celebrating 
before the whales were freed as the soviet icebreakers drew 
near the whales were acting in a very excited manner almost like 
they can sense freedom said sgt ian robertson an alaska 
national guard spokesman 
by midday the soviet icebreakers were a quartermile from the 
line of breathing holes being cut by americans working in the 
opposite direction he said 
later wednesday rescuers began to use a gargantuan tractorlike 
device propelled by pontoon augers to clear the ice cut by the 
icebreaker robertson said 
the breakthrough in the effort to free the migrating gray whales 
caught in an early freeze came after more than a week of delays and 
disappointments 
we feel very good about it said rear adm sigmund petersen 
of noaa the cooperation has just been fantastic the soviets came 
in here with a very positive attitude and went to work immediately 
on tuesday the americans moved the huge mammals around a shoal 
that had stymied progress for three days eskimos with chain saws 
cut a detour in the ice so the whales could swim around the shallow 
water they had refused to pass 
when the eskimos started cutting the air holes the whales 
followed the water right to the end they like that deeper 
water petersen said 
working in the other direction the soviet icebreakers reduced to 
rubble the ice ridge standing between the whales and open water the 
ridge formed by colliding ice masses was a jumble of ice blocks as 
big as small houses 
the whales seemed to be doing fine petersen said its 
like they expected something to be happening everything seems to be 
coming together 
the whales which normally migrate to the southern california 
coast in the winter were discovered off alaskas northern coast 
three weeks ago the ice closing in around them and leaving them 
only a few small breathing holes 
the whales could not swim the four miles to open water without 
surfacing for air a third whale disappeared friday and is believed 
dead 
the icebreakers the admiral makarov and the arseniev began 
working shortly after their arrival tuesday flying the flags of the 
soviet union and the united states as a sign of cooperation between 
the nations 
the ships had been returning to their home port of vladivostok 
when they were diverted said alexander patzevich chief officer and 
second in command 
although the admiral makarov has been at sea for six months and 
everybody is tired none of the crew of 78 has complained about 
the diversion patzevich said 
its very nice to work together he said of the ussoviet 
effort 
first mate vladimir moroz who said he was the ships political 
officer said the soviets were happy to help he said he spoke to a 
moscow newspaper by telephone 
theyre receiving many many calls asking about the whales 
he said our country is watching like everyone else we love 
animals just as everyone 
the population of endangered california gray whales has risen to 
about 20000 growing at an annual average of 25 percent for the 
past decade officials said 
the whales have one of the longest migration routes of all the 
mammals some 6000 to 8000 miles from the arctic to the warm water 
off baja california 
the human persistence and determination by so many individuals 
on behalf of these whales shows mankinds concern for the 
environment president reagan said from the white house it has 
been an inspiring endeavor

two national polls have found george bush 
consolidating his lead in the presidential race with fewer voters 
saying they may change their minds although many remain 
dissatisfied with their choices 
bush held doubledigit leads in the cbs newsnew york times and 
gallup polls released tuesday further evidence of a surge for the 
republican nominee since his debate with democrat michael dukakis on 
oct 13 
bush led dukakis by 13 points among probable voters in the 
cbstimes poll 5441 percent and by 5040 among registered voters 
in gallups poll he led by 14 points among gallup respondents 
judged likely to vote 
bush had led by a consistent but narrow margin four to seven 
points in most polls since late august but the numbers started to 
move in his favor last week and the new results continued that 
trend 
in one key finding the cbstimes poll found clear success in 
bushs attacks on dukakis on crime sixtytwo percent said bush was 
tough enough in dealing with crime and criminals just 37 percent 
said the same of dukakis 
in another 25 percent said the political commercials they had 
seen helped them decide whom to support and more than half of that 
group went for bush still 62 percent said commercials had not 
helped them decide 
the polls found dissatisfaction with both nominees in the 
cbstimes poll 64 percent wished they had other choices than bush 
and dukakis and just 42 percent of gallups respondents had a 
strong preference compared with about 60 percent at this stage in 
the 1984 election 
the surveys nonetheless found voters more firm in their 
decisions in gallups 28 percent said they were undecided or could 
change their minds down from 37 percent before the debate in the 
cbstimes poll 74 percent said their minds were made up compared 
with 66 percent earlier 
as in other polls bush received disproportionate support from 
men they favored him by 54 percent to 38 percent in the gallup 
poll while women backed him by a far tighter 46 percent to 42 
percent margin 
the poll demonstrated that voter choices were based on the top of 
the ticket the democrats trailed even though dukakis running mate 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas was rated far more favorably than was 
bushs sen dan quayle of indiana bentsen was viewed favorably by 
59 percent unfavorably by 27 percent for quayle it was 4244 
fiftynine percent in the gallup poll said they had a favorable 
opinion of bush to 35 percent unfavorable dukakis did less well 
50 percent favorable 43 percent unfavorable the small remainders 
didnt answer 
the leads in the two polls were less than the bush advantage in 
the first fullsized survey conducted after the oct 13 debate an 
nbc newswall street journal poll that found him ahead by 17 points 
no other poll has found a bush lead that great it was followed 
by abc newswashington post and harris polls that found sizable but 
smaller bush leads seven and nine points respectively last 
weekend a newsweek poll done by gallup put the bush advantage at 
nine points 5041 
the new gallup poll released tuesday was conducted friday through 
sunday among 1232 registered voters and had margin of sampling 
error of plus or minus three points of the total 815 were 
considered to be likely voters the result among that group had a 
fourpoint error margin 
the cbstimes poll was conducted friday through monday among 
1287 probable voters and had a threepoint error margin 
meanwhile bush took a slight lead over dukakis in a statewide 
poll in rhode island which was long thought to be safe territory 
for the democrat from nearby massachusetts 
the poll conducted by joseph fleming amp associates for wpritv 
found bush with 46 percent support dukakis with 41 percent and 13 
percent not sure 
the survey of 414 registered voters was conducted last week and 
had a nearly fivepoint margin of error meaning the bush lead is 
just large enough to be statistically significant 
in the democratic stronghold of maryland bush led dukakis 51 
percent to 42 percent the washington post reported in todays 
editions the post survey of 601 likely voters was conducted tuesday 
through saturday and had a margin of error of four percentage points

when presidential campaigns enter their closing 
days its a good bet the candidate denouncing the negative tactics 
of his opponent is running behind 
the first candidate to demand the opposition stop lying about his 
record is probably in trouble 
the democrat who turns to populism is trying to turn the tide 
the republican who warns against big spending is trying to do the 
same 
that is the pattern of campaigns past and present sometimes it 
works 
echoes of those closing arguments are being heard as the 1988 
presidential campaign winds down 
full of lies and he knows it says a new michael dukakis ad 
denouncing the negative campaign tactics of george bush the 
television spot closes with this dose of populism 
the real question is will we have a president who fights for 
the privileged few or will we have a president who fights for you 
the dukakis commercial was not the first time a candidate who 
felt he was losing to bush accused the vice president of distorting 
his record 
one of the more memorable moments of the campaign for the 
republican presidential nomination was the night of the new 
hampshire primary bob dole whose dream of winning the nomination 
had been shaken by bushs new hampshire victory was asked if there 
was anything he wanted to say to the vice president 
dole glared at the camera and snapped yeah tell him to stop 
lying about my record 
it was all downhill from there for the kansan who thought he 
could have won in new hampshire if the oppposition hadnt portrayed 
him as soft on tax increases 
but the bush attacks probably harmed dole less in the long run 
than his demand that they stop the senators demeanor during that 
televised instant resurrected memories of his illfated run as the 
gop vice presidential nominee in 1976 a race he later would admit 
did not serve him well 
harry truman wrote the book on how to upset a favored republican 
opponent with a strong dose of populist rhetoric 
im going to fight hard truman recalled telling his running 
mate kentucky sen alben barkley im going to give them hell 
truman set the tone at his opening rally on labor day 
if in this next election you get a congress and an 
administration friendly to labor you have much to hope for he 
told a rally made up largely of union members if you get a 
congress and an administration unfriendly to labor you have much to 
fear 
hubert h humphrey tried the same sort of populist appeal in the 
closing weeks of the 1968 presidential campaign against richard m 
nixon the minnesotan succeeded in bringing many democrats back to 
the fold and the election turned out much closer than anybody had 
predicted but humphrey fell 510000 votes short of overtaking nixon 
or this 
he has campaigned with negativism failing the american people 
by refusing to lay out for them worthwhile programs in major fields 
which for two months i have been discussing in frankness and 
detail 
that appeal sounds a little like the theme dukakis now is 
sounding but it was used by nixon in 1960 and directed at john f 
kennedy 
nixon said kennedy advocates a niagara of spending which would 
in the end either raise their taxes or prices and would cheapen 
their insurance policies pensions and social security 
ive got news for those republicans were going to be the ones 
celebrating on election night is a favorite dukakis campaign line 
the pollsters and the republicans are in for the biggest 
surprise of their lives said walter f mondale the day before he 
lost 49 states 
in the closing days of the 1976 campaign president gerald r 
ford said i think we are neck and neck and when you have momentum 
and the opposition is trying to put its finger in every dike to try 
and stop the erosion obviously we have the momentum going and they 
are frantic frustrated and frenzied 
and gee i just feel good about it just wonderful 
ford did have momentum at that stage of the campaign but not 
enough to overtake democrat jimmy carter

incumbents in the nations senate races have 
rolled to a 3to1 advantage over challengers in fund raising this 
year underlining the need for campaign finance reform says the 
lobbying group common cause 
senators seeking reelection collected 102 million to finance 
their campaigns as of sept 30 compared with just 38 million for 
challengers according to the groups analysis of reports submitted 
to the federal election commission 
the analysis showed that one of four dollars flowing to 
contenders in the nations 33 senate races comes from 
specialinterest groups and incumbents enjoyed a 5to1 edge in 
receipts from the political action committees or pacs 
specialinterst pacs are money machines for incumbents said 
common cause president fred wertheimer in a statement the 
congressional campaign finance system is patently unfair to 
challengers 
the selfstyled citizens lobby has been waging an uphill fight 
for years to restrict pac giving to campaigns and to impose overall 
spending limits to give incumbents less of a lock on a house or 
senate seat campaign finance reform is expected to be near the top 
of the list of legislative priorities when the 101st congress 
convenes in january 
senate candidates had raised 1617 million by sept 30 
according to the analysis nearly 39 million of that came from pacs 
their financial edge enabled incumbents to spend 2 for every 
dollar spent by challenges on average and still go into the final 
month of the campaign with a huge cash advantage cash on hand for 
the 27 incumbents totaled 333 million as of sept 30 compared 
with just 73 million for their opponents 
on average incumbents raised 37 million each while challengers 
averaged 14 million each the study found 
in the six races where there is no incumbent seeking reelection 
florida wisconsin mississippi washington virginia and vermont 
contenders have raised a total of 214 million 47 million of 
it from pacs a slightly greater proportion than in the other 
contests 
the top fundraiser overall according to the study is incumbent 
sen pete wilson rcalif wilson had collected 125 million toward 
his reelection bid and also topped the spending list with 98 
million in expenditures california is one of the most expensive 
media states in which to mount a campaign 
wilsons opponent democratic lt gov leo mccarthy had raised 
54 million and spent 34 million on his challenge 
the largest recipient of pac money was sen lloyd bentsen who is 
waging dual campaigns for reelection to his texas senate seat and 
as democratic vice presidential candidate bentsen also chairman of 
the taxwriting senate finance committee pulled in 23 million 
from specialinterest groups wilson ranked second on that list 
with 2 million

the operator of the contaminated three mile 
island nuclear plant hopes to mothball the reactor next year but a 
panel of citizens and scientists says more commitments to clean up 
the site are needed first 
a spokesman for the pennsylvania plants operator said tuesday 
that managers hoped to go ahead with the plan to place the crippled 
unit 2 reactor into monitored storage by the end of 1989 
next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the nations worst 
commercial nuclear accident at three mile island on march 31 1979 
the storage plan calls for the reactor building to be locked up 
and unneeded systems deactivated the plant would sit for perhaps 30 
years while radiation decays inside 
although the damaged nuclear fuel and loose radioactive 
components would have been removed from the plant radiation would 
remain in piping and other areas of the reactor building basement 
the advisory panel for the decontamination of unit 2 told the 
nuclear regulatory commission during a meeting tuesday that nine of 
its 11 members had sided against the socalled post defueling 
monitored storage plan which is known as pdms 
arthur e morris the panel chairman and the mayor of lancaster 
pa said many in the group felt the plan was too vague he said the 
panel believed the cleanup should proceed expeditiously 
with no specific funding in place morris said there were 
concerns that the cleanup of the plant might not be completed even 
after the storage phase ended in addition he said area residents 
were troubled by the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how many 
years the reactor would sit idle until it was decommissioned 
the utility seems to have looked at this pdms as a given and 
sort of expected us to go along with it said panel member joel 
roth 
in the 1979 accident unit 2 was allowed to lose vital cooling 
water that normally covers it the subsequent 1 billion cleanup has 
focused on water decontamination waste shipment and removal of fuel 
from the damaged core 
doug bedell a spokesman for gpu nuclear the plant operator 
said in an interview after tuesdays meeting that the cleanup would 
likely stop at the end of next year he said it was pointless to 
expose cleanup workers to additional risk after that because 
remaining radiation would be fixed in place presenting no 
threat to the public 
he said the utility envisioned letting unit 2 sit idle until 
after its twin unit 1 ended its service life in about the year 
2010 then both units would be dismantled together 
gpu nuclear would need an amendment to its nuclear regulatory 
commission license before it could proceed with its storage plan 
the decision on whether to grant the change would be made by the nrc 
staff although it is possible the commissioners themselves would 
get involved

president reagan has banned most nicaraguan 
government officials from entering the united states in the latest 
round of a titfortat diplomatic feud 
under a proclamation released tuesday by the white house reagan 
declared the unrestricted entry of officers and employees of 
the nicaraguan government and the sandinista national liberation 
front to be detrimental to the interests of the united states 
the prohibition applies to all nicaraguan government and party 
officials with the exception of those carrying out activities 
related to the united nations or other international organizations 
family members of such officials are exempted as well 
the diplomatic tussle began on july 11 when managua expelled 
us ambassador richard melton and seven other american officials on 
grounds they interfered in nicaraguas internal affairs 
the united states retaliated the next day by expelling nicaraguan 
ambassador carlos tunnermann and seven of his colleagues 
since then the sandinista government has not acted on us 
attempts to replace the expelled us envoys 
weve been trying to get our people replaced and we havent 
gotten anywhere white house spokesman roman popadiuk said 
a call placed to the nicaraguan embassy seeking comment was not 
returned 
the presidents action also comes in light of a new restriction 
placed on us officials in nicaragua last month 
on sept 22 the sandinista government imposed the new 
requirement that american diplomats based in nicaragua who leave the 
country for whatever reason must wait at least three weeks before 
they may return 
the dispute was aggravated last month when the reagan 
administration refused to allow nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
to bring a delegation of 60 nicaraguans on a proposed visit to the 
united nations and to washington 
the state department said the nicaraguans applied too late for 
their visas a claim the sandinistas denied ortega canceled the 
trip

the national association of home builders says 
it wont recommend any changes in insulation practices to combat the 
buildup of radon which government officials say is probably the 
secondranking cause of lung cancer 
at a news conference tuesday an official with the association 
said it is telling its members to continue employing the same 
practices we have recommended for years for energy conservation 
john spears program manager at the associations national 
research center said weve found that energy conservation has 
little to do with radon concentration in the house 
spears conclusion tracks with our preliminary results over the 
past few years for both new homes and existing homes said 
environmental protection agency spokesman chris rice epa is engaged 
in a cooperative research program with the center 
but epa says increased ventilation still may be useful in 
reducing radon buildup in particular homes 
last month epa and the public health service advised that 
everyone living on a second floor or below should have indoor air 
tested for radon the public health service issued a health 
advisory elevating indoor radon to the same status as smoking as 
a health threat 
epa believes radon ranks second only to smoking as a cause of 
lung cancer of the 130000 annual deaths from lung cancer about 85 
percent are caused by smoking epa estimates radon could cause as 
many as 20000 deaths which if true would be roughly all those not 
caused by smoking 
radon is a radioactive gas emitted in some degree by all soils 
it quickly decays into other substances but its decay products are 
also radioactive and can lodge in the lung irradiating the tissue 
for a lifetime indoor dust and smoke and smoke from tobacco 
products can carry these decay products into the lung 
there are many techniques for reducing radon buildup often the 
same techniques that are used to keep water out of basements such as 
careful sealing of joints use of tight covers on sumps and a thick 
polyethylene barrier between the slab and the ground 
william h ethier litigation counsel for the association said 
members were being advised that if they make a reasoned judgment 
that there may be high radon levels they should rough in 
mitigation techniques such as underslab ventilation pipes that may 
be ignored later if appropriate or connected to a fan to divert 
radonladen air around the basement 
in states such as pennsylvania and new jersey with 
wellpublicized instances of radon buildup ethier said he has found 
universal adoption of such precautions by builders 
builders report that the techniques may add as little as 100 to 
the cost of a home if water barriers are already being used but as 
much as 600 if they are not he said

new drugs in the medical war against cancer and 
cardiovascular disease are now available or on the way 
the food and drug administration announced tuesday that a new 
drug to treat the crippling effects of intestinal cancer can now be 
marketed in the united states 
in addition the pharmaceutical manufacturers association said 47 
companies are now working on a total of 87 new drugs to treat the 
cardiovascular diseases of high blood pressure stroke and heart 
disease 
the new cancer drug is a protein compound called octreotide 
acetate that is designed to stop the severe unrelenting diarrhea 
that often takes the lives of patients suffering from intestinal 
cancer 
fda commissioner frank e young said the new drug can 
dramatically improve life for these cancer patients permitting many 
to pursue their normal lives for years rather than be weakened and 
continually hospitalized 
the new drug marketed by sandoz pharmaceuticals under the brand 
name sandostatin does not actually attack the cancer itself 
instead it blocks production of a peptide that causes the diarrhea 
young said patients with malignant carcinoid tumors and 
vasoactive intestinal peptidesecreting tumors often can live 15 to 
20 years before dying as a direct result of the slowgrowing cancer 
but because the cancer forces the secretion of peptides that cause 
the severe diarrhea patients usually die sooner 
sandostatin prevents the diarrhea by blocking the secretion of 
the peptides the drug does this by imitating the action of 
somatostatin a natural hormone that regulates secretions from the 
bodys organs the drug is administered by injection 
the fda said the cancer is diagnosed in one to two people per 
million annually 
gerald j mossinghoff president of the pharmaceutical 
manufacturers association said a survey of the association members 
indicates there are 87 new drugs for cardiovascular disease 
treatment now in clinical trials or awaiting final fda approval 
no other disease is targeted by so many drugs in development or 
so much investment in research said mossinghoff 
he acknowledged at a news conference that one of the reasons the 
companies are pouring so much investment into cardiovascular 
diseases is that there remains a huge market for such therapies even 
though doctors now realize they are among the most preventable 
illnesses for people who adopt healthy lifestyles in their early and 
middle years 
dr john f beary iii senior vice president for science and 
technology for the trade association noted that heart disease 
remains the nations no 1 killer and stroke no 3 
even though the population is generally healthier as well as 
older than in years past beary said at some point these 
diseases catch up with everyone 
the pharmaceutical trade groups survey of its more than 100 
members was designed to provide an overview of the scope of new drug 
development in various categories rather than highlight any 
particularly promising breakthrough drugs 
the trade association plans similar surveys in december for 
cancer drugs under development and in january for arthritis 
alzheimers and other diseases of the aging 
the cardiovascular disease survey found more medicines being 
developed for hypertension or high blood pressure than any other 
condition with all but three of the 38 drugs in that category in the 
final stages of testing 
the pharmaceutical association said the second largest category 
with 28 drugs under development is congestive heart failure

a commuter airliner crash last february that 
killed all 12 people on board was caused mainly by an excessively 
rapid turn after the aircraft took off from raleighdurham nc 
airport federal investigators say 
the national transportation safety board on tuesday blamed pilot 
error for the avair crash but it said contributing factors were the 
commuter lines failure to act when it received information the 
pilot had previous flying problems and the governments inadequate 
monitoring of the airline which had financial problems 
the avair plane flying as american eagle flight 378 crashed 
shortly after it took off in dense fog on feb 19 l988 landing in 
wooded area about a mile from the airport runway 
the fairchild metro iii commuter was bound for richmond va 
with 10 passengers a pilot and a copilot 
the ntsb criticized the federal aviation administration for not 
keeping a closer watch on avairs financial problems during a period 
of rapid expansion and not forwarding such information to the 
inspectors assigned to the airline 
avair had undergone rapid growth in 1987 as a feeder for american 
airlines at raleighdurham it was ranked the 30th largest commuter 
airline in the country last year carrying 351522 passengers but met 
hard times in late l987 it filed for bankruptcy last january 
resumed operation in february but sold its commuter operation to 
american airlines in may 
the ntsb said the probable cause for the feb 19 accident was 
the failure of the flight crew to maintain a proper flight path 
due to the first officers inappropriate instrument scan the 
captains inadequate monitoring of the flight and the flight crews 
response to a fault in the airplanes stall avoidance system 
the investigation revealed that the copilot kathleen digan 28 
who had been hired by avair in may 1987 had a spotty flying record 
and on a number of occasions had been the subject of critical 
evaluations by various avair captains 
in july 1987 an avair captain wrote the airlines operations 
chief on hotel stationery that ms digan had trouble on eight of 10 
landings she flew during their trip together and that he considered 
her performance unacceptable two months later another avair 
captain reported in an evaluation that ms digan had problems in 
clmb cruise descent and landing maneuvers 
according to the ntsb she was hired by avair on march 5 1987 
when the airline needed scores of new pilots because of expansion 
plans ms digan was one of 123 pilots hired by avair in the second 
quarter of l987 according to the safety board 
ms digan had 2080 hours of flying including a total of 450 
hours on a fairchild metro ii and metro iii at the time of the 
accident 
investigators determined that ms digan was at the controls when 
the metro iii commuter plane departed raleighdurham on feb 19 
although there was evidence that the captain walter cole 38 
attempted to help keep the aircraft aloft in the final seconds 
the flight was the first she had flown in instrument conditions 
in 4 weeks the report said 
flight 378 had been told by air traffic control to bank to the 
right as soon as possible after takeoff because of the heavy traffic 
loads at the time of the departure investigators said 
but ms digan flying in foggy conditions banked the aircraft at 
only 200 feet and at a 40 degree angle almost twice as sharp as 
would have been prudent and likely became somewhat disoriented 
allowing the plane to descend the safety board said 
the pilots were relying on instruments because of the poor 
visibility and the ntsb concluded that if the pilots had scanned 
their instruments adequately they would have known the bank was too 
sharp and at too low an altitude 
the ntsb report said the pilots also might have been distracted 
by a light indicating that the aircrafts stall warning system had 
activated the system automatically forces the nose down if the 
aircraft is approaching a stall 
according to the investigation the aircrafts performance 
indicated that the stall warning system actually had not deployed 
and the problem stemmed from a false warning light

the ink was barely dry on the military 
baseclosing law signed by president reagan this week when 17 
senators began trying to make sure their homedistrict bases are 
spared at the expense of others 
the senators from northeastern and midwestern states claimed 
that the sunbelt region has a disproportionate share of military 
installations and therefore should suffer the most cuts 
the senators said in a letter tuesday that a pentagonappointed 
commission should consider regional inequities as it decides 
which bases to close 
reagan had signed the baseclosing bill just one day earlier it 
authorizes the defense department to close unneeded military bases 
to achieve savings of up to 5 billion per year 
a 12member commission is authorized to make the decisions and 
report on is conclusions by dec 31 congress may veto the entire 
list but cannot act to protect individual bases as it often has in 
the past 
we wish to prevent the further entrenchment of regional 
inequities stemming from the location of existing military 
facilities said the letter from members of the northeastmidwest 
senate coalition 
the letter was addressed to abraham ribicoff a former senator 
from connecticut who cochairs the defense secretarys commission on 
base realignment and closure 
jim abbee spokesman for the base closing commission laughed and 
said so whats new when told about the senators letter abbee 
said he would not comment further until he had seen a copy 
the senators said in their letter that sunbelt states already 
enjoy an advantage in numbers of bases 
the letter pointed to a report by congressional conferees on the 
baseclosing bill that said geography should be carefully weighed 
during the commissions deliberations leading to its closure and 
realignment recommendations 
however that provision was dropped before the legislation was 
given final approval 
defense secretary frank c carlucci will have until jan 15 to 
accept or reject the list of recommended base closings 
signing the letter were the two senators each from pennsylvania 
new york new jersey illinois maine michigan and massachusetts 
and sen joseph biden ddel claiborne pell dri and richard 
lugar rind

about 90000 farmers who are behind in their 
loan repayments to the farmers home administration will be getting 
notices shortly after the nov 8 election telling them to start 
making arrangements for settlement 
the agriculture department agency said tuesday the notices will 
be an attempt to collect about 88 billion in pastdue loans 
spokesman marlyn aycock said rules implementing new credit 
legislation will take effect nov 14 and that dear farmer jones 
notices will start going out soon thereafter to the delinquent fmha 
borrowers 
aycock said the notices will say this is to inform you that 
youre seriously behind in your loan payments and to inform you of 
your options farmers who are more than 180 days late in making 
payments have several options 
the notices will explain that the fmha borrowers must notify the 
agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make arrangements 
for settling their debts details regarding the options including 
debt restructuring and writeoffs also will be provided 
aycock said the timetable for sending out the notices as promptly 
as possible took into consideration the months of rulemaking 
periods for public comment and time for training fmha people to 
handle the additional job load 
congress ordered fmha to revise its lending practices in the 
agricultural credit act of 1987 the agency is often called the farm 
lender of last resort because it makes loans only to those who 
cannot qualify at banks or other commercial sources 
the debt writedown or forgiveness provision is regarded as one 
of the most important parts of the 1987 law it allows fmha to 
reduce a farmers delinquent debt to the recovery value of the 
collateral which is usually land or farm equipment depending on 
cash flow and other factors 
also as the result of lawsuits the fmha is under court order to 
redo many of its loan regulations and to hold up on foreclosures and 
forced liquidations until those actions are completed 
estimates of the extent of fmha loan delinquencies and numbers of 
farmers potentially threatened by foreclosure under the new rules 
have varied 
last may 23 when the new regulations were proposed fmha losses 
resulting from writeoffs and other settlements were estimated at 
about 87 billion and that about 118000 borrowers were delinquent 
about 64800 of those could be pushed into liquidation or 
foreclosure because they couldnt qualify for help under the new law 
another major step was an interim rule announced on sept 14 
including procedures for making debt restructuring and writedowns 
those were to take effect on oct 14 on an interim basis and called 
for final adoption on nov 14 after a 60day period for public 
comments 
in the september announcement the earlier analysis was used 
again which referred to 118000 delinquent borrowers including 
about 65000 who would be rejected for debt writedowns the 
potential losses were said to be as high as 94 billion although 
about 1 billion could be salvaged by the agency 
aycock said the current estimate of 90000 delinquent borrowers 
was based on figures last fall when fmha delinquencies are 
historically lower than those in january when the 118000 were 
reported

agriculture department scientists say that tiny 
beneficial worms or nematodes can be produced in a laboratory 
dried out for storage and revived later to fight destructive pests 
in back yards 
theyre still living and breathing but theyre dormant says 
entomologist james e lindegran of the departments agricultural 
research service laboratory fresno calif 
lindegran and researchers at a california biotechnology firm 
biosys found that the microscopic nematodes such as steinernema 
feltiae can be dried stored as a paste under refrigeration and 
then revived with water 
when you add water the worms plump back up again lindegran 
said in a report issued here by the usda agency when they start 
moving around theyre ready to be sprayed onto plants trees or 
soil 
the beneficial nematodes attack pests that are in the larvaal or 
wormlike stage of development by entering through openings such as 
the mouth or breathing tubes he said 
once inside a pest the nematodes excrete a unique bacterium 
that kills the pest is food for the nematodes and produces 
antibiotics that keep other bacteria at bay lindegran said 
the nematodes are harmless to humans but lethal to a variety of 
pests including carpenterworms cutworms armyworms fruit flies 
and root maggots

service said in a new outlook report on the nations agricultural 
resources 
although the 198788 export acreage was up 11 percent from the 
previous year it was far below the record high of 137 million acres 
in 1980 the report said 
of the 107 million acres needed to grow crops for export last 
year food grains mainly wheat and rice led with 40 million

the reagan administration is preparing to 
support a loan request by chile in the interamerican development 
bank indicating a policy shift that state department officials say 
reflects improved human rights performance in that country 
the bank was expected to take up chiles request for a 35 
million loan for rural road repair today 
the administration has invariably abstained on such requests in 
recent years as evidence of its displeasure toward the policies of 
the countrys military government 
according to the officials chiles human rights record has 
improved substantially in recent months with the lifting of a 
15year old state of emergency in august and a national plebiscite 
held three weeks ago 
chilean voters denied president augusto pinochet an additional 
eightyear term and open elections are scheduled for next year 
until recently the administration had frequently criticized 
chile on grounds that it was one of only a handful of hemispheric 
countries that had not moved toward democratic rule 
the only exception to the administrations policy of abstaining 
on chilean loan requests involved projects that offered direct 
benefits to the poor the pending request before the iadb does not 
fall into that category 
the state department officials insisting on anonymity said the 
us decision to support the road repair loan does not mean chile 
can count on us backing for future loan requests 
those votes will be based on chiles future human rights record 
and on the viability of the project for which financing is sought 
abstentions cast by american delegates to the iadb and other 
international financial institutions on chilean requests usually 
were symbolic because chile was able to count on enough support from 
other bank members to ensure approval of its applications 
the united states is the principal contributor to the iadb which 
was set up 30 years ago to promote development in latin america 
the administration policy to abstain on most chilean requests 
generally was supported by congress which enacted a statute a 
decade ago barring the executive branch from assisting countries 
engaging in gross and consistent human rights violations 
chile was never placed in that category but the administration 
decided to show disapproval over the situation in chile through the 
abstention policy 
there are a number of other impediments to the restoration of 
normal relations between the united states and chile for more than 
a decade congress has barred military aid and training to chile as 
well as bilateral economic aid 
the officials said no decision on lifting any of these sanctions 
is expected this year

oliver l north and his codefendants 
perpetrated a classic fraud on government when they diverted 
profits from the usiran arms sales to help arm the nicaraguan 
rebels prosecutors said 
responding to norths contention that he did not defraud the 
government prosecutors said the four irancontra defendants created 
a secret slush fund for activities outside the normal channels 
of governmental accountability 
by overcharging iran for weapons in the armsforhostage 
transactions north and the others undermined president reagans 
initiative to free americans held in lebanon by proiranian groups 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said in pleadings filed 
tuesday 
north and former national security adviser john m poindexter 
chose to advance their private unauthorized ends at the cost of 
putting at hazard the ends they were supposed to be pursuing 
including that of saving the lives of the americans held hostage in 
lebanon 
north poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord are charged with conspiring to 
defraud the government and theft by diverting more than 14 million 
in armssale profits to a criminal enterprise that secretly 
financed the nicaraguan contra rebels 
norths lawyers contended in pleadings filed oct 11 that there 
was no fraud or theft because the government didnt own the weapons 
after they were sold to secord and hakim who acted as middlemen in 
the transactions 
but walsh said the alleged scheme constitutes a classic fraud 
on the government 
the thrust of the fraud is the breach of the public trust 
poindexters and norths discharge of their official duties eg 
execution of the iran initiative was driven by a concealed and 
wholly improper motive a desire to generate a slush fund for use 
in financing unauthorized activities designated by them 
prosecutors said north a retired marine lieutenant colonel 
exploited his position to exact from iranians a high selling 
price while concealing from the government the nature of the price 
spread and his control over the excess profits 
the goals of establishing improved relations with iran and 
potentially securing the release of american hostages held by groups 
sympathetic to that country were undermined and put seriously at 
risk by the conspirators private motive to charge prices well in 
excess of what otherwise might have been charged in order to secure 
additional profits the prosecution said 
defendants secord and hakim agreed to hold funds generated by 
north and to apply them to purposes selected by north and poindexter 
outside the normal challenges of governmental accountability 
prosecutors said 
secord and hakim reaped lucrative profits from the money north 
steered to them as middlemen in the transactions prosecutors said 
prosecutors said they were not required to show that the 
defendants activities undermined reagans effort to free the 
hostages it is enough that it was reasonably foreseeable that 
they would have that effect as it clearly was 
no date has been set for the trial of north the first of four 
trials ordered by us district judge gerhard a gesell

the massive rescue effort to save two california gray whales 
wont make a difference to the survival of the species but its 
been a public relations dream for environmentalists trying to rouse 
the world to save its oceans 
whats the big deal i dont know it all of a sudden 
exploded said howard braham director of the national marine 
mammal laboratory in seattle the chief us research center on 
whales 
only the individual can answer if its worth it braham said 
were dealing with the human spirit we allow some awfully damning 
things to go unchecked and then we reach out to something with a 
tear in our eye 
the leviathan rescue has thrown together an unlikely army of 
wouldbe saviors whalehunting eskimos greenpeace 
environmentalists oil companies the us and soviet governments 
wildlife experts animal behavior specialists and chainsaw 
mechanics an international cast of some 40 to 60 reporters keeps 
the world informed of any progress 
the two surviving gray whales imprisoned by the ice are part of 
an endangered species meaning they are thought to be in imminent 
danger of becoming extinct 
but the population of grays is flourishing there are about 
21000 which is near the historic peak of 25000 reached before 
whale hunters slaughtered all but a few thousand around the turn of 
the century 
the soviets kill 169 gray whales each year to feed eskimos under 
an exemption granted by the international whaling commission and 
another 1000 animals die of natural causes yearly according to 
government estimates 
despite the losses the population of grays increases by 25 
percent a year and the deaths of three wayward whales not yet old 
enough to breed would be insignificant scientists said 
theres no loss from a biological standpoint said research 
biologist david withrow from the national marine mammal laboratory 
but cold facts have no chance against heated emotions when human 
nature fights mother nature 
the whales have names biologists call the two survivors bonnet 
and crossbeak the inupiat eskimos who discovered them oct 7 call 
them putu and siku for ice hole and ice a third whale bone or 
kanik for snowflake apparently died friday 
television brought the whales into us homes nightly pictures 
of their battered and bleeding snouts protruding from a breathing 
hole cut like a harpoon into american hearts 
these animals are turning out to be ambassadors for all marine 
life said susan vernon of the whale museum in friday harbor 
wash i dont think its overreaction its a catharsis the 
helping hand was extended and it was extended in good faith 
gray whales feed in the icy arctic ocean then migrate 7000 
miles to breed off balmy baja california the three trapped whales 
were migrating for the first time 
even experienced bowhead whales equipped with thick skulls to 
break through ice get hemmed in about 10 to 12 of them perish each 
year off northern alaska biologists said 
some have questioned the expense of trying to save the whales 
which had reached upward of 600000 and counting as of monday 
while funding for us whale research has been cut the annual 
budget for the national marine mammal laboratory is 2 million down 
from 28 million in 1985 
however much money theyre spending on the rescue is fine 
said patty warhol director of the american cetacean society in san 
pedro calif 
that money might be better used in research but you just cant 
buy that kind of public relations for whales she said today 
there are people all over the country talking about whales who two 
weeks ago didnt know they existed or thought they were big fish 
the mercy mission has melted hearts of grizzled oil field 
roustabouts from the bonechilling north slope who also have reaped 
a public relations harvest of good will for their labors 
veco inc of prudhoe bay offered to send a 185ton ice 
pulverizing hoverbarge to smash a pathway to the sea with arco 
alaska inc donating fuel to the alaska national guard helicopter 
that tried vainly to coax it to the whales the barge got stuck in 
shallow water 
it was a common cause to help the underdog were human too 
said marvin king operations manager for veco its not money 
its not headlines we wanted to do what we could to help another 
mammal 
we did what we should have done said ben odom senior vice 
president of arco alaska its a sad sight to see them struggling 
to stay alive whats that worth to help them were not discouraged 
by the naysayers

songwriter sammy cahn has won five 
oscars and an emmy but he says one of his biggest thrills will be 
performing at an atlantic city casino this weekend 
when i get to atlantic city im going to laugh so loud at the 
marquee said cahn 75 whose songs include love and marriage 
high hopes and call me irresponsible 
to see my name in a place where so many performers have come to 
sing my songs do you know what a kick that will be 
cahns excitement also may be due to the fact that although hes 
been in show business 60 years hes only been performing for about 
15 years 
i always wanted to be a performer but when i started out 
vaudeville was phasing out said cahn 
when i get on stage i have a most unique show and when i 
finish they stand up and cheer cahn said not because i 
finished but because its a miracle

one made bad the other makes 
ram pickup trucks and michael jackson and lee iacocca had a 
similarly brief exchange of words when the pop superstar met the 
chrysler corp chairman 
iacocca met jackson backstage shortly before the singer performed 
monday night at the palace of auburn hills the meeting was set up 
after one of jacksons attorneys wrote to iacocca 
michael had read lees book talking straight and you know 
michael is mentioned in the book chrysler spokesman john guiniven 
said there was a mutual interest in the meeting 
but guiniven said he had no idea what the two said to each other 
in talking straight iacocca defended the 205 million he 
made in 1986 through salary and stock options writing 20 
million sounds more like michael jacksons income for a weekend than 
the annual pay of a guy who cant carry a tune in the shower 
iacoccas estimate was off the mark if monday nights show was 
anywhere near jacksons standard net income from the concert was 
125000 an amount jackson donated sunday to the motown museum 
honoring the motown records label to which he and his brothers were 
signed in 1969

two soviet ships arrived and one began 
pounding through ice tuesday in an effort to free two gray whales 
trapped off the northern alaska coast for nearly three weeks 
the admiral makarov started breaking ice almost immediately after 
the vessel arrived near point barrow by evening the ship had made 
substantial progress and was expected to continue working through 
the night with its companion cargo vessel the vladimir arseniev 
clearing away the shattered ice 
the soviet ships flew the flags of both the soviet union and the 
united states in a symbol of international cooperation the rescue 
effort called operation breakthrough also has involved eskimos 
with chain saws and an unusual vehicle called an archimedes screw 
tractor acting in concert 
its very nice to work together to do something good between 
two people said alexander patzevich chief officer of the admiral 
makarov 
us coast guard capt joseph mcclelland jr called the effort 
terrific and was optimistic the whales would be freed 
with the wind going the way it is it couldnt be better he 
said 
biologists reported the whales were in good condition 
they moved around a shoal through which they had refused to pass 
earlier and by tuesday night they were about two miles from an open 
lead or pathway through the ice and 2 miles beyond the site at 
which they and another whale were found 
rescuers meanwhile received one bit of good news about the 
jumbled mass of ice 
they discovered that a pressure ridge apparently was not anchored 
to the sea bottom as initially was feared a pressure ridge is where 
two opposing ice masses meet 
it appears that most of the ridge has a current running through 
it making it easier for the icebreakers to work said ron morris 
a biologist with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
the california gray whales must get through the tangle if they 
are to reach the nearest completely open water 200 miles away in 
the chukchi sea 
gary hufford with the national weather service said he and 
another ice expert were working on the pressure ridge monday when 
they had some unwelcome company a polar bear a helicopter pilot 
landed the aircraft between the whales and the bear which caused 
the animal to leave 
its something to remember there are not only whales out 
there hufford said 
the whales were stranded about 100 yards offshore nearly three 
weeks ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of barrow a 
third whale disappeared friday and is presumed dead 
biologists reported a setback late monday when the whales balked 
near a shoal and retreated about a halfmile toward shore 
craig george a biologist with the north slope borough said the 
whales overnight remained well back from a series of new breathing 
holes that had been cut toward the ice ridge they apparently were 
spooked by the shallow water 
there is about 12 feet of water over the 125yardwide shoal 
george said the whales had been spending most of the time in water 
17 to 25 feet deep 
the turnaround came after rescuers switched tactics monday they 
connected a series of breathing holes to form a single open channel 
some 600 yards long eskimos used long poles to guide the miniature 
icebergs toward the rear of the slot 
initially the strategy worked but when the channel behind them 
was nearly filled the whales reversed course struggling up for air 
by poking their way through the large slabs of ice and thick slush 
that setback offset earlier excitement about the performance of 
the archimedes screw tractor a 12ton machine that smashes up to 18 
inches of ice as it moves along on pontoons shaped like augers 
it leaves a slushy path 14feet wide in its wake technicians 
were building a rake of sorts tuesday designed to follow along in 
the channel behind the big auger the rake is supposed to shunt the 
slush down and under the adjacent ice officials said 
biologists said they also were considering plan c a 
lastditch possibility that they may have to airlift the animals to 
open water withrow said it was a last resort because the whales 
could be injured

wages in the past 12 months have risen an 
average 39 percent but private employer costs for benefits have 
soared 67 percent more than double the previous year largely on 
increases in social security taxes the government said tuesday 
the combined effect of the pay raises and higher benefit costs 
have sent total employer costs up 47 percent in the 12 months 
ending oct 1 compared with a 34 percent rise in the previous 
12month period the labor department said 
inflation as measured by the consumer price index has risen by 
42 percent over the past 12 months the government reported last 
week 
the steep increase in benefit costs resulted primarily from a 
rise last january in employers social security tax rate from 715 
percent to 751 percent the labor department said 
it also cited large increases in health insurance costs and 
lumpsum bonus payments from profitsharing arrangements which are 
now calculated by the government as a benefit rather than a wage in 
the 12 months ending october a year ago benefits costs rose only 
31 percent but they went up 67 percent in 12 months ending oct 1 
nonunion employees continued to get bigger percentage pay raises 
than union members a trend begun in 1983 except for bluecollar 
workers in manufacturing 
the bureau of labor statistics said wage rates among union 
members rose an average 29 percent in the past 12 months compared 
with 39 percent for nonunion workers in the previous 12month 
period union wages rose an average 17 percent compared with 38 
percent for nonunion employees 
this pattern reversed when limited to bluecollar workers in 
manufacturing the bureau said with wage increases in the past 
year averaging 32 percent for union members and 28 percent for 
nonunion workers 
for the first time the government also is comparing total 
compensation increases between union and nonunion workers to 
account for the lumpsum arrangements 
with those benefits included employer costs rose the same 45 
percent among union and nonunion employees the bureau said 
john zalusky an economist for the aflcio called the statistics 
refreshing 
theyre beginning to show in fact what is really going on out 
there in the world he said but there still is a good way to 
go 
for example zalusky cited the last round of steel industry 
contracts in which the union conceded pay cuts to companies then 
operating at losses in exchange for a share of future profits or 
stock transfers if no profits occurred 
the statistics are now picking up the profit distributions but 
not the stock transfers for what essentially is a debt owed 
workers he said in the future i expect them to start putting 
in the value of stock ownership plans and in the distant future 
retraining funds such as those negotiated with the auto companies 
despite the disparity in percentage wage increases in recent 
years unionized workers continue to make about 35 percent more than 
nonunion workers an average gap of 123 a week in 1987 compared 
with a gap of 119 in 1986 according to government data 
among whitecollar workers wage increases have averaged 42 
percent over the past 12 months compared with 4 percent the 
previous 12 months the government said bluecollar wages have 
increased a smaller 33 percent respectively over the same two 
periods 
the biggest pay gains 56 percent were among business and 
health service workers followed by an average increases of 49 
percent for professional and technical employees 
managers and executives along with state and local government 
workers have averaged the same 47 percent wage gains over the past 
year the average pay increase among private industry workers was 
37 percent for a combined average gain for all workers of 39 
percent the labor department said 
by regions the biggest pay increases over the past 12 months 
have been in the northeast 46 percent followed by the south at 
38 percent average raises in the west and midwest were 32 percent 
and 29 percent respectively 
in a separate report tuesday the labor department said annual 
pay rose an average 46 percent among the 101 million workers with 
jobs in the nations 317 metropolitan areas last year 
kenosha wis with large pay increases in manufacturing and 
construction had the biggest average increase up 106 percent 
from 18666 in 1986 to 20648 in 1987 
the new havenwaterburymeriden area of connecticut and the 
monmouthocean city nj metropolitan areas were next with average 
annual pay increases of 84 percent last year 
on the other end of the scale workers in flint mich with a 
large decline in employment and falling wages in manufacturing 
suffered an average pay loss of 42 percent from 26633 in 1986 
to 25514 last year 
other cities in which average pay fell last year were anchorage 
alaska anderson ind enid okla lawrence kan lansing mich 
midland texas and pine bluff ark 
despite the decline anchorage continued to have the highest 
average pay level in the country at 28486 new york city was next

what do you do when your presidential candidate 
is a bit too boring lacking the star quality that sends crowds into 
a frenzy you cast your gaze on hollywood and search the sports 
arenas for the celebrities who can inject a little glamour into your 
campaign 
robert redford cher charlton heston morgan fairchild john 
elway don johnson 
aides to democrat michael dukakis and republican george bush 
definite runnersup in the glamour category have enlisted the help 
of hollywoods boxoffice draws and sports superstars to attract a 
crowd liven up a stump speech and capture a few more precious 
seconds on the evening news 
when dukakis delivered a speech denouncing the reagan 
administrations environmental record to a college audience in new 
brunswick nj he was accompanied by actor director and 
environmentalist robert redford 
the blondhaired star of such movies as butch cassidy and the 
sundance kid downhill racer the candidate and legal 
eagles drew squeals and cheers from the large crowd on the rutgers 
university campus 
redford also delivered a line that made every network news 
program 
hello everybody im dan quayle joked redford whom quayle 
has been said to resemble 
redford continued his effort to help dukakis appearing at a 
toxic landfill in aurora colo a onceheavily polluted river in 
seattle and other stops around the nation 
im a citizen just like you are redford told the crowd in 
seattle earlier this month being an actor doesnt mean you lose 
your citizenship 
at the republican national convention the gop had actor charlton 
heston intone the pledge of allegiance in a voice many believe is 
what god sounds like it worked as delegates chattering and moving 
about on the convention floor paused to join the ben hur and 
ten commandments star in reciting the pledge 
even before bush and dukakis had secured the nominations the 
campaigns were using celebrities 
tennis star pam shriver in her job with the bush campaign 
called members of bushs 1139 club which included current and 
former party officials selected as delegates to the convention the 
number 1139 was the total needed to win the gop nomination 
through a questionnaire the campaign determined delegate 
background information such as birthdays personal interests and 
issues of most concern 
its an effort to create a national bush family said david 
sparks who served as bushs chief delegate counter 
ms shriver who was assigned three or four delegates to keep in 
touch with was available to discuss both the vice presidents 
campaign and how to improve a crosscourt volley 
former new york giants and minnesota vikings quarterback fran 
tarkenton now an atlanta businessman has served as honorary bush 
campaign cochairman in georgia where he is recruiting businessmen 
we need to get off the seats of our pants tarkenton said 
last month in announcing his plans 
but involvement in the political process doesnt always draw 
praise when penn state football coach joe paterno agreed to deliver 
a seconding speech for bush at the gop convention the states 
democratic gov bob casey criticized paterno questioning whether a 
state college coach should take on such a highprofile political 
posture 
paterno who coached his football team to a national championship 
two years ago gave the speech anyway 
fifty celebrities including ms fairchild cher gregory peck 
and hollywoods brat pack star rob lowe chose to help the 
democratic cause by traveling to cities in california oregon and 
washington for a voter registration drive 
meanwhile some of their compatriots in the los angeles area met 
for the traditional hollywood political event a fundraiser with 
the candidate television producer norman lear held the celebrity 
fete last month for dukakis with miami vice star johnson actor 
burgess meredith comedian chevy chase and actress goldie hawn in 
attendance 
some superstars however get involved without knowing it 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle received denver 
broncos quarterback john elways autograph and jersey during the gop 
candidates stop in colorado 
the teams treasurer and chief financial officer made the 
presentation unbeknown to elway 
im glad quayle got it instead of dukakis because im going 
for bush elway said when informed of the gift

election violence broke out after a twoweek 
lull when likud supporters tried to push past police to attack the 
car of foreign minister and labor party leader shimon peres the 
itim news agency reported 
nine likud supporters were arrested in tuesdays skirmish in the 
tel aviv suburb of petah tikva 
itim also reported that unknown assailants twice fired shots at 
the headquarters of the communist party hadash in the arab city of 
nazareth in northern israel 
earlier in the campaign protesters threw stones at peres and his 
secondincommand defense minister yitzhak rabin during separate 
appearances in the towns of kiryat gat and afula during a rally in 
beit shemesh a 61yearold man dumped a cup of beer on peres 
the violence appeared to taper off after prime minister yitzhak 
shamir leader of the rightwing likud party appealed to party 
activists for calm 
dozens of likud supporters however showed up tuesday at a peres 
rally in petah tikva and heckled the leader of the leftleaning 
labor party as he delivered a campaign speech 
later they rushed at peres car after police formed a protective 
circle and tried to hustle him away from in front of city hall 
earlier tuesday police and bodyguards surrounded peres as he 
campaigned at the crowded central bus station in jerusalem 
dozens of admirers drowned out the boos of opponents with the cry 
peres will bring peace 
one businessman said he would vote labor because the party 
promises to hand back the densely inhabited portions of the 
territories israel seized from egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle 
east war 
peres says hell give away the gaza strip thats half our 
demographic problem right there businessman shimon rosen said 
during the campaign labor has used the euphemism demographic 
problem to refer to the fact that palestinians will eventually 
outnumber jews if israel holds on to the occupied territories 
at least 15 million arabs live in the west bank and gaza strip 
and 700000 more live inside israel the jewish population of israel 
is about 35 million but is growing at a far slower rate than the 
arab population 
labor urges handing control of large parts of the occupied 
territories to jordan to assure a jewish majority inside israel 
the 11month uprising against israeli rule by palestinians in the 
occupied lands that has claimed the lives of at least 303 
palestinians and six israelis thousands of palestinians have been 
wounded and arrested 
the reported shooting in nazareth was the latest in a series of 
incidents in the arab sector primarily involving the three arab 
parties hadash the progressive list for peace and the arab 
democratic party 
the arab parties and some jewish ones are vying for the 350000 
votes in the arab sector in some villages party activists have 
been roughed up and warned to stop their activities by members of 
rival groups 
polls indicate that the race between labor and likud uneasy 
partners in the current governing coalition is closely contested 
the election is nov 1

determining which countries are making chemical 
and biological weapons will be one of the most difficult challenges 
facing the cia in the next decade the agencys director says 
william webster who became head of the spy agency in may 1987 
said tuesday that libya is developing the largest chemical plant 
that i know of for chemical warfare 
in a speech to the world affairs council webster said the 
intelligence community must pay close attention to developments in 
the soviet union afghanistan and the persian gulf in the 1990s 
he also said morale at the agency was high rejected the notion 
that covert activities should be carried out by the military and 
said congressional review plays an important role in guiding the spy 
agency 
he stressed his concern about chemical weapons which he said 
were used both by iran and iraq in their eightyear war that was 
halted by a ceasefire in august 
intelligence support will be vital to the success of us 
efforts to prevent the use of chemical weapons he said noting 
that president reagan has called for an international conference to 
revive a ban on chemical weapons the united states will try to 
block the export of chemical weapons and ballistic missile 
technology he said 
webster said chemical weapons often referred to as the poor 
mans nuclear arms are being developed by more than 20 countries 
as many as 10 countries are working on production of biological 
weapons 
these weapons could affect stability in southeast asia and in the 
middle east where the balance of power may be altered by the 
production of chemical weapons by at least three arab states syria 
libya and iraq 
of particular concern to the cia is the possibility that 
countries might arm ballistic weapons with chemical warheads he 
said 
virtually every city in the middle east is now subject to such 
an attack if these two types of weapons are combined he said 
among the weapons that are being made are mustard gas nerve 
agents and some that use industrial chemicals such as cyanide and 
phosgene 
most of these plants look like nothing more than fertilizer 
plants and are difficult to detect he said 
assessing the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons 
is one of the most difficult challenges we face in the intelligence 
community now and into the next decade it is also one of our most 
important tasks for these weapons may well represent one of the most 
serious threats to world peace in the coming years he said 
discussing ussoviet relations webster said soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs reforms present intelligence agents with a 
very formidable challenge the cia must assess the impact of the 
reforms 
regardless of the arms control agreements signed between the 
united states and the soviet union webster said our relationship 
is likely to remain adversarial 
the cia head said he expects the soviets will adhere to their 
plan to withdraw troops from afghanistan by next february but 
moscow will continue to maintain ties to the kabul regime 
we believe afghanistan will remain unstable for a period of 
time he said the afghan rebels will likely continue fighting 
among themselves and 5 million refugees the majority of whom are 
in pakistan must be resettled 
although moslems predominate in afghanistan webster said the cia 
does not believe a fundamentalist regime such as that of irans 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini will dominate 
with the end of the iraniraq war intelligence analysts will try 
to find out what each countrys intention is in the region the 
americans also want to learn what effect the wars end will have on 
the american hostages held in lebanon by proiranian groups he said

president reagan has resolved a dispute between 
the state and defense departments over how much onsite inspection 
should be sought in negotiations with the soviet union on a treaty 
to reduce longrange nuclear missiles according to a report 
published today 
the new york times says the president chose a plan backed by the 
state department civilian defense department leaders had argued in 
favor of a far broader verification proposal 
under the proposal chosen a list of sites would be agreed upon 
at which each side could conduct shortnotice inspections the times 
says each country would be given the right to conduct snap 
inspections at these designated sites mainly those used to make 
rocket motors for solidfuel missiles said the newspaper citing 
unidentified administration officials 
each country also would have the right to request quick 
inspections of any facility in the others territory but if the 
facility was not on the list of designated sites the request could 
be denied 
the party that rejected the inspection would be required to 
explain its reasons and to take action to alleviate the other sides 
concerns over possible cheating the times said 
the newspaper said the plan was generally supported by the joint 
chiefs of staff the central intelligence agency and the arms 
control and disarmament agency as well as the state department 
the treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear missiles ratified 
by both countries provides for shortnotice inspections of missile 
sites and stationing inspectors at one missile assembly plant in 
each country 
us and soviet strategic arms negotiators are expected to recess 
their talks in geneva in midnovember and not resume them until next 
year

key problems among children in americas 
cities including drug abuse pregnancy and school dropouts have 
grown worse over the past five years according to a report released 
today by the us conference of mayors 
these problems plus inadequate health care for children in 
lowincome families and a lack of affordable child care worsened in 
80 percent of the cities that cited them the study said 
the report surveyed officials in 52 cities in 22 states and the 
district of columbia it was financed by the foundation for child 
development and published by the us conference of city human 
services officials an affiliate of the us conference of mayors 
j thomas cochran executive director of the mayors group and 
the affiliate said the report was intended to lead us toward 
critically needed investments in our childrens future and 
consequently in our countrys future 
the study also said poverty was a highpriority problem facing 
children in urban areas 
it estimated that 285 percent of the more than 185 million 
children living in central cities live in poverty compared with a 
20 percent poverty rate for all us children 
the study found problems affecting children in the cities include 
insufficient day care it said an estimated 45 percent of the 
need for licensed child care goes unmet 
a 38 percent average high school dropout rate in the class of 
1988 even though 60 percent of the cities reported investing public 
money in programs to encourage students to stay in school 
a 146 percent rate of births to mostly unmarried teenage 
mothers among the 529458 births in the survey cities during 1986 
the rate of births to black teens was even higher at 216 percent 
that year 
an infant mortality rate among blacks of 185 per thousand in 
1986 compared with a rate of 126 per thousand for all infants 
the report said mayors of the survey cities believe the most 
important policy decisions to be made by the next president for the 
benefit of children would be to increase the availability of child 
care provide adequate funding for family and childrens programs 
increase the emphasis on and funding for substance abuse prevention 
and make a greater investment in education

after confusing her for months with her twin sister jeanelle

michael dukakis presidential campaign 
plans to take the unprecedented step of buying television time for 
his running mate lloyd bentsen as part of its final preelection 
push 
the campaign has purchased a fiveminute block of time on the cbs 
television network on sunday night and will probably air a spot that 
bentsen tapes late today in los angeles said tad devine who 
coordinates bentsens campaign for dukakis 
we want to take full advantage of all the assets we have 
said devine mentioning bentsens high ratings from the public 
especially when combined with the low ratings given his republican 
counterpart dan quayle 
the combination of the two is really very powerful he said 
bentsen lately has been attacking the republicans for negative 
campaigning and what he calls a character assassination of dukakis 
the kind of campaign these republicans are waging would tear 
the heart out of a democracy he told a rally tuesday night in 
great falls mont 
the republicans started right after the democratic convention 
with a smear campaign ranging from claiming dukakis was mentally ill 
to saying that his wife kitty had burned the flag all 
outrageous lies bentsen said 
bush campaign ads saying that dukakis would weaken the us 
military were untrue he said as was their claim that dukakis 
planned to take guns away from sportsmen 
bentsen has been receiving enthusiastic responses from the crowds 
where he speaks more than a thousand people packed the courtyard 
tuesday night rally in a casino hotel in great falls and cheered 
wildly as bentsen spoke in front of an enormous american flag and 
all of the states top elected democrats 
but in the national news he has been working in the shadows of 
the two presidential candidates said his press secretary mike 
mccurry 
increased television exposure including a planned appearance on 
the cbs evening news tonight and the paid time on sunday night 
could help deliver that message to more of the electorate he said 
i think he wants to say something about the campaign and the 
quality of the campaign mccurry said i think there will be a 
concentrated effort to make people aware of the broadcast 
including some paid advertising he said 
never before has a campaign bought network time for its vice 
presidential candidate and less than a week ago the campaign was 
leaning against such a move devine said but the plan fit in with 
the overall effort by dukakis to seek maximum exposure in the final 
two weeks of the campaign he said noting that dukakis own 
television schedule was heavier than bentsens 
bentsen stumped through the dakotas and into montana on tuesday 
the states have only 10 electoral votes between them but the 
democrats contend they have a good shot at south dakota and montana 
especially and those states could make the difference in a close 
election 
from states with the fewest electoral votes bentsen was flying 
today to california which at 47 has the most clout in the electoral 
college

communist authorities insisted on yet 
another preliminary meeting with lech walesa before roundtable 
talks with the opposition can begin but the solidarity chairman 
refused 
the dispute arose tuesday when the government said it wanted to 
discuss its objection to two solidarity delegates to the talks 
which authorities agreed to in august in return for an end to 
polands worst labor unrest in seven years 
walesa said in a telephone interview that he would not agree to 
the governments demand that he meet today with interior minister 
gen czeslaw kiszczak on the matter 
i will not allow any personnel changes he said it could 
be a precedent a dangerous precedent for the future 
a statement issued later by solidarity national spokesman janusz 
onyskiewicz ruled out any change in the banned free trade union 
movements delegation but expressed hope that the longawaited talks 
could begin 
polands planned economy is in crisis with wages lagging far 
behind consumer prices which the government raised by an average of 
40 percent earlier this year 
a communique issued by the official pap news agency after the 
ruling politburos weekly meeting tuesday said the government was 
firmly committed to the talks and expressed hope that remaining 
controversies will be quickly removed in the course of preparatory 
talks 
the squabble began when government spokesman jerzy urban said a 
fourth preparatory meeting between walesa and kiszczak was 
indispensible for the talks to begin 
the government objects to two people proposed by solidarity to 
participate and wants clarification on whether the two advisors 
jacek kuron and adam michnik agree to accept the leading role of 
the communist party urban said 
he said walesa and kiszczak should meet today and if they 
settled their differences the talks could begin friday 
urban charged that solidaritys stubbornness was preventing 
the talks from beginning but said the friday date did not represent 
an ultimatum and the government would be willing to meet later 
assuming questions about participation and other technical matters 
were resolved 
walesa said he had not given up hope for the talks to bring about 
understanding and the implementation of pluralism but he said 
another meeting with kiszczak was unnecessary 
urban said the government has problems with the participation of 
kuron and michnik because the two dont respect polands 
constitutional order which guarantees the communist partys leading 
role 
if jacek kuron and adam michnik really wish to participate in 
the conciliation process it would be no problem for them to 
publicly declare that they respect and will respect the 
constitutional order he said 
kuron declined comment a telephone call to michniks home went 
unanswered 
in a first meeting with kiszczak on aug 31 walesa agreed to 
bring a halt to a wave of strikes after being guaranteed that the 
talks would address the reinstatement of solidarity the only 
independent labor movement ever allowed in the soviet bloc 
the opposition has demanded that the talks lead to the 
legalization of solidarity which was outlawed after a december 1981 
military crackdown 
but polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski said friday he opposes 
such a move until the economy is healthier and changes in the system 
allow political demands to be vented outside of trade unions 
the government said monday a specially built round table capable 
of seating more than 50 people had been set up at its jablonna 
palace in suburban warsaw in readiness for the talks 
invited to attend the talks in addition to solidarity are 
representatives of the powerful roman catholic church official 
trade unions and governmentapproved social groups

the revival of death squads in el salvador has 
resulted in the assassination of hundreds of suspected government 
opponents during the past two years amnesty international said 
today 
the reemergence of death squads usually made up of troops and 
police coincides with the armed forces open opposition to the 
policies of president jose napoleon duarte the londonbased human 
rights organization charged 
members of the clandestine death squads customarily wear plain 
clothes use unmarked trucks or vans with tinted windows and often 
dump mutilated victims on the roadside as a means of terrifying 
the population it said in a report 
some victims are shot from passing cars in daylight in front of 
witnesses while others are seized from their homes or in the street 
and never heard of again or turn up in notorious body dumps 
the report said 
the deathsquad killings are routinely carried out by regular 
units of the armed forces which include the military and the 
security services and by special intelligence units that 
incorporate civilian gunmen under their supervision and control 
it said 
since early 1987 victims have included trade unionists human 
rights workers returned refugees and members of the judiciary 
attempting to establish responsibility for human rights violations 
the report said 
abductions and attacks have often occurred near police or 
military installations or under the gaze of uniformed security 
personnel who made no effort to intervene it said 
the squads intimidate opponents by publishing death lists in 
newspaper advertisements and delivering coffins to the homes of 
intended victims the report said 
dumped bodies frequently are found decapitated dismembered 
strangled or showing marks of rape or torture such as burns and 
machete wounds it said 
military authorities abducted and summarily executed tens of 
thousands of suspected leftists in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
but the killings dropped off sharply after duartes usbacked 
civilian administration came to power in 1984 the report said 
the government says the killings are the work of extremists who 
act independently and cannot be apprehended but amnesty 
internationals report said evidence gathered over many years from 
a wide range of sources points to security force responsibility 
a lava bed 12 miles north of el salvador called el playon where 
skeletons of bodies devoured by birds of prey were common in the 
early 1980s fell into disuse until an unidentified body was found 
there in january the report said 
bodies also are again being dumped at a site known as the devils 
doorway at panchimalco 12 miles southeast of the capital the 
report said 
in 1987 an average of 12 bodies a month showing death 
squadstyle mutilations were found dumped along roadsides it said 
it said tutela legal a roman catholic human rights group in san 
salvador estimates as many death squadstyle disappearances and 
killings occurred in the first quarter of this year as in all of 
1987 
amnesty international gave no estimate of the number of 
deathsquad killings over the last six months 
other deliberate killings have been falsely ascribed by armed 
forces spokesmen to clashes with opposition forces the report said 
amnesty international said renewed deathsquad killings have 
occurred as the armed forces high command has expressed open 
opposition to duartes policies including his negotiations with 
leftist guerrillas 
the assassination a year ago of herbert anaya sanabria president 
of the salvadoran human rights commission was widely interpreted 
as an attempt to hamper these negotiations the report said 
it said reports this summer that duarte is terminally ill with 
cancer have been another factor affording the armed forces even 
greater control over counterinsurgency policies 
the 9year civil war has killed an estimated 65000 people most 
of them civilians

a man who claimed he found a mouse in a 
can of beer was sentenced to 18 months in prison and apologized 
after pleading guilty to product tampering and extortion 
i want to publicly admit that i caused a mouse to be placed in 
a can of coors beer and acknowledge the wrongdoing of that act 
james n harvey 30 said in court tuesday 
circuit judge r hudson olliff gave harvey until nov 1 to begin 
serving his sentence 
harvey claimed he discovered the mouse july 27 after taking a few 
drinks from a 16ounce can of coors 
he called the coors consumer hotline two days later coors 
initially offered to pay 1500 for the mouse and the can but he 
refused and later asked for 35000 
the apology was part of a plea bargain said assistant state 
attorney e mcrae mathis 
we felt in this case it was appropriate and it was necessary to 
ensure that the consumer confidence in a consumer product was given 
back to a company because that is the very thing that was taken away 
from a company said mathis 
adolph coors co of golden colo will drop a lawsuit against 
harvey for loss of sales and damage to its reputation said company 
spokeswoman cary baird 
our purpose in filing the lawsuit was not for revenge but to 
restore consumer confidence in our products said company 
president peter h coors we also wanted to send a clear message 
that product tampering is a serious crime against consumer 
confidence and trust that will not be tolerated 
olliff sentenced harvey to 18 months in prison on each of the two 
counts and ordered that they be served concurrently

a young man who hit a police officer was 
ordered jailed for a year and has to write a sentence as part of his 
sentence people do not have to put up with a jerk like me one 
hundred times a day for each day behind bars 
as part the sentence for 19yearold steven r sommer circuit 
judge michael hoover stayed a 3year prison term and placed him on 
five years probation 
it just seemed to me at the time that if i put this kid in 
prison he was going to come out one tough case hoover explained 
in an interview tuesday 
the judge said sommers selfimage may change if he has to 
suffer the humiliation of being treated like a miscreant junior high 
schooler by having to write the sentence a total of 36500 times 
sommer who kicked out a squad car window and was subdued by four 
officers after being stopped for a traffic violation pleaded guilty 
last month to a felony battery charge 
hoover noted during mondays sentencing that sommer had shown no 
remorse he said he believed prison would offer little chance of 
rehabilitation for someone who would probably tell fellow inmates he 
had been convicted of beating up a cop 
my basic concern was not to reinforce the image he had of being 
a tough youknowwhat that people had to put up with or suffer the 
consequences the judge said tuesday 
sommer was stopped jan 31 by roger watral marathon assistant 
police chief for speeding watral testified during a preliminary 
hearing that sommer became upset and used vulgar language when the 
officer told him he was speeding 
the officer said he smelled alcohol on sommers breath and later 
saw a can of beer in the car 
sommer refused three times to do what the officer asked him to do 
and made a mockery out of the field sobriety test watral 
testified 
when the officer tried to put handcuffs on the 6foottall 
sommer the man jerked his arm back hitting the officer across the 
lower lip and kicked him in the groin watral said 
three other officers had to be called in to subdue sommer 
authorities said 
sommer pleaded guilty to battery in exchange for the state 
dropping charges of resisting arrest and causing criminal damage to 
property he was also cited for drunken driving as a thirdtime 
offender and fined 1331

march north of atlanta and awarded 948650 in damages to 49 
demonstrators who filed suit 
it is a message to the ku klux klan nationwide that this can 
happen to you said state rep je billy mckinney one of the 
demonstrators 
mckinney said he and the other plaintiffs are determined we 
will get every dime that we can get out of the klan 
the award the second major one involving a klan organization in 
two years includes 400000 each from the southern white knights of 
the ku klux klan and the invisible empire knights of the ku klux 
klan david holland grand dragon of the southern white knights was 
ordered to pay 50000 the highest of the 11 defendants 
i guarantee if hollands got a pickup truck im going to 
take it if hes got a shotgun in the back of the truck im going 
to take it too and i want his confederate flag mckinney said 
defense attorneys were stunned by the verdict unsealed tuesday 
and said they would appeal hollands attorney jeffrey sliz called 
it grossly unreasonable 
another defense attorney jane plaginos said the plaintiffs had 
no proof for any injury that would mandate such severe damages 
they did not prove anybody was hurt literally or lost wages 
anything they did not prove anything she said 
she said that within 30 days she would ask us district judge 
charles a moye jr to dismiss or lower the damages 
the jury reached its verdict oct 5 agreeing that the violence 
amounted to a violation of the marchers civil right moye ordered 
the verdict sealed until tuesday to give those who brought the 
lawsuit time to decide whether to join city councilman hosea 
williams who wanted to drop it 
williams who helped organize the march and was among those who 
filed the lawsuit urged toward the end of the trial that the suit 
be dropped because it would impoverish the families of kkk members

ordered to pay 30000 but he said the marchers may have a hard time 
collecting it 
if the 30000 holds up and i dont feel that it will hold up 
they would play the devil getting it stephens said i dont 
have anything such as that 
stephens an electrician said he rents his home 
the march was a forerunner to a larger demonstration a week later 
in which an estimated 24000 people turned out state local county 
and federal troops were called out to protect the marchers and 
prevent violence 
in february 1987 an allwhite federal jury in alabama awarded a 
black woman beulah mae donald 7 million from the united klans of

a federal appeals court has rejected democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis attempt to use his power as 
governor to block a massachusetts national guard training mission in 
central america 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals issued a onesentence order 
tuesday affirming a may 6 decision by us district judge robert 
keeton who upheld federal supremacy over the national guard 
having examined the briefs of the parties and having had 
the benefit of oral argument we affirm the judgment on the basis 
stated in the district courts wellreasoned opinion the appeals 
court said 
dukakis sued in january to block the assignment of 13 public 
relations specialists in the massachusetts guard to honduras and 
panama for two weeks in may because of his opposition to reagan 
administration policies in the region 
in his presidential campaign dukakis has denounced the 
administration for its failed and illegal policy of supporting 
nicaraguan rebels and he said sending guard troops to the region 
was an attempt to intimidate nicaragua 
dukakis who was campaigning tuesday in california and colorado 
had no immediate comment on the appellate decision a press aide 
steven crawford said the governor was disappointed that the court 
chose not to uphold the important principle of state authority 
state attorney general james shannon who represented dukakis in 
court said he would wait until another federal appeals court rules 
in a similar challenge before deciding whether to appeal to the us 
supreme court 
john bolton chief of the civil division in the us justice 
department said he was pleased by the ruling it represents the 
complete vindication of the administrations position 
after keeton issued his ruling in may dukakis appealed but did 
not try to stop the massachusetts troops from participating in the 
exercises which involved roadbuilding 
in his decision keeton explicitly upheld the constitutionality 
of the montgomery amendment a 1986 act of congress that says 
governors may not decline such assignments because of any 
objection to the location purpose type or schedule of such 
activity 
at issue in this case is the constitutional status of the 
modern national guard keeton wrote framing his question in terms 
of competing clauses in the us constitution that divided control 
over the new nations militia between the federal government and the 
states 
lawyers for the us justice department argued that the army 
clause in the constitution gives congress the ultimate say over 
the nations entire military apparatus they described dukakis 
position as a dagger aimed at the heart of national defense 
the massachusetts attorney generals office representing 
dukakis had claimed that the militia clause reserved power to 
the governors over training the militia 
assistant attorney general douglas wilkins stressed the 
original intent of the constitutions framers arguing that 
state control over the militia was essentially undisturbed by 
the many reorganizations of the nations military 
minnesota gov rudy perpich joined by massachusetts and nine 
other states challenged the law last year in us district court in 
st paul and lost the case is now on appeal

nancy reagan has called for an allout 
domestic war on drug users saying wall street bankers who use 
cocaine should be punished along with dealers smugglers and 
colombian drug kingpins 
america not foreign drug producers bears responsibility for 
its narcotics problem the first lady said in a speech tuesday at 
the united nations 
each american drug user she said is an accomplice to every 
criminal act every murder every terrorist attack carried out by 
the narcotics syndicates 
to get serious about stopping illegal drugs mrs reagan 
said that means confronting all those citizens who use drugs 
if the united states cannot choke off the demand for drugs she 
said there is little hope of halting production and smuggling 
it is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug 
lords or drug smugglers she said than to arrest a pair of wall 
street investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch break 
mrs reagan made the comments in a speech to the un third 
committee on social and humanitarian affairs in 1985 she and other 
first ladies addressed an international conference against drug 
abuse at the united nations when she sounded her antidrug slogan 
just say no 
in his eight years in office president reagan has advocated a 
war on drug producers in latin america and elsewhere as well as the 
interdiction of drugs smuggled into the united states 
but the us administration has been criticized for its dealings 
with panamanian strongman gen manuel noriega indicted in the 
united states for drug trafficking and for not cracking down on 
governments that allow domestic drug production 
in her speech mrs reagan emphasized the need for police to 
arrest and for courts to punish all drug users it is as important 
to stop drug use in the united states she said as it is to stop 
cocagrowing in peru processing in colombia and shipping through 
the caribbean 
it is the united states alone which bears responsibility for 
its own drug problem she said while most of the illegal drugs 
are imported the drug users are homegrown 
if we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our 
own country to arrest and punish drug users if we cannot stem the 
american demand for drugs mrs reagan said then there will be 
little hope of preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling 
that demand

two women who were pen pals with anne frank and 
her sister have sold the correspondence at auction for 150000 and 
plan to use the money to retire and to fund an organization for 
christian missionaries 
the anonymous buyer who also paid a 10 percent fee to the 
auction house will give the letters to the simon wiesenthal center 
in los angeles according to the new york times 
the women had hoped the buyer would put the letters which are in 
english in a setting where they can be viewed publicly 
we enjoyed them for 48 years and were just hoping that maybe 
the world will get to see them said betty ann wagner 
miss wagner and her sister juanita wrote to anne and her sister 
margot in 1940 at the suggestion of a teacher in their 
thenhometown of danville iowa at the time anne and juanita were 
11 margot and betty ann were 15 
anne and margot sent back two photographs a postcard and two 
letters describing their life in amsterdam holland margot wrote 
that having a frontier with germany and being a small country we 
never feel safe 
the wagners wrote back but never heard from the franks again 
a month after the letters were sent germany invaded the 
netherlands the franks who were jewish went into hiding in the 
attic of a house in amsterdam but were later discovered and sent to 
concentration camps annes diary published in 1952 carries a 
poignant account of their life in hiding 
wed worried about her during the war but never dreamed she 
was suffering said miss wagner reached at her home in the los 
angeles area 
she added that she and her sister who also lives in california 
hope to visit the house in amsterdam where the franks hid 
after the war the wagners wrote to the franks again annes 
father replied to say that he was the only one in his family to 
survive the war 
rhonda barad director of the wiesenthal centers eastern region 
said the letters would be exhibited at a new museum in los angeles 
when it is completed next year 
we wanted the letters said barad whose organization is 
named for the famed nazi hunter the focus of the center is to 
teach tolerance and thats what anne franks diary and her life 
represent 
miss wagner said she plans to donate part of the money from the 
sale to wayfarer ministries a nonprofit organization she founded 
nine years ago to help christian missionaries around the world 
the auction house swann galleries had predicted that bidding 
would exceed 30000 but could not estimate how high it would go 
because nothing written by anne frank had ever been auctioned before 
among the bidders was actress whoopi goldberg one of hundreds 
who participated in the auction by telephone 
also sold at the auction were several marilyn monroe autographs 
including her certificate of conversion to judaism which took place 
just before her marriage to playwright arthur miller the 
certificate was bought by a private collector for 7000 said will 
bennett a swann spokesman 
a handwritten letter of condolence from emily dickinson to the 
husband of a friend who died was on the auction block as well 
bringing 8000 from a dealer 
seventysix pages of handwritten notes by thomas edison brought 
32000 edison compiled the manuscript which concerns his travels 
jobs and inventions for use by his official biographers bennett 
said 
a collection of correspondence from greta garbo was bought by a 
collector for 9500 bennett said

a oncerespected defense lawyer committed 
depraved murder by beating his illegally adopted 6yearold 
daughter and doing nothing to save her life a prosecutor said in 
the attorneys murder trial 
assistant district attorney peter casolaro made the opening 
statement tuesday as lisa steinbergs biological mother michele 
launders sobbed in the courtrooms front row 
the girls death nearly a year ago drew national attention and 
made her a symbol of the plight of abused children 
as lisa steinberg lay unconscious the defendant did absolutely 
nothing casolaro said adding evidence showed prompt medical care 
would have saved the childs life 
joel steinbergs failure to act constituted depraved murder 
casolaro said 
steinberg 47 is charged with seconddegree murder in the death 
of the child he took illegally at birth from ms launders then an 
unmarried long island teenager he has denied ever hitting lisa 
casolaro said graphic and grotesque evidence and testimony 
would prove steinberg murdered lisa who was found unconscious at 
the steinberg apartment in greenwich village early nov 2 and died 
three days later 
the firstgrader had bruises on her chest legs arms and neck 
and head injuries caused by bluntforce trauma when she arrived 
at the hospital casolaro told the state jury police officers 
noticed steinbergs bleeding knuckles he said 
steinbergs attorney ira london said in his opening that the 
evidence would not support a murder charge and called on the jury to 
acquit his client 
it will not be proven in this case that lisa steinberg was 
murdered nor will it be proven that lisa was a battered child 
london said lisa was neither sullen or withdrawn she was a 
vital active and engaging child until her death 
steinberg has said lisa became sick the night of nov 1 after 
eating and that the bruises on her back and chest resulted from his 
efforts to revive her after she fell unconscious 
no help was called for lisa until after 630 am on nov 2 
court records show 
london on tuesday attacked hedda nussbaum steinbergs longtime 
livein companion who judge harold rothwax called the single most 
important witness in this case 
ms nussbaum has an agreement with the district attorneys office 
to testify although she has told prosecutors she did not see 
steinberg strike lisa the day she fell unconscious 
ms nussbaum was charged in lisas death but was never indicted 
and the charges will probably be dropped the district attorneys 
office said after her arrest she underwent surgery and psychiatric 
treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted by steinberg 
london called ms nussbaum delusional and pointed out that 
she had spent the last year in a mental hospital 
undoubtedly you will hear witnesses refer to heddas 
selfdestructive romance with satanic cults her sadomasochistic 
behavior outside the home and her involvement with pornography 
london said 
casolaro painted ms nussbaum as another victim of steinberg 
he exploited her weakness of mind and her emotional problems 
the prosecutor said the defendant beat and broke miss nussbaum 
until she had become nothing more than his willing servant 
one of the trials first witnesses paramedic john filangeri 
testified that ms nussbaum was in such bad shape the night of the 
death she appeared to be 70 to 80 years of age ms nussbaum is 
46 
police officer james botte the first person to arrive at the 
apartment and see the unconscious girl testified the home was 
dirty unkempt and dark when he arrived 
a 16monthold boy mitchell was found in the apartment sitting 
in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen authorities have said 
the boy was also illegally adopted and now lives with his 
biological mother 
the trial is to resume thursday

bearing a luggage tag eastern officials said tuesday that they were 
not aware of any arrests related to the seizure 
we provided information about the possible shipment of drugs 
and were being punished for providing the information said 
ceremsak 
but customs spokesman clif stallings said tuesday the airline was 
not involved in any of the drug investigations 
we have no information from them at all about that seizure or 
any of the preceding three in the past two months he said 
abraham azzam formerly a us drug enforcement administration 
agent now easterns top drug security officer said the airline is 
spending 3 million on security but drug traffickers will continue 
using airliners certainly cocaine is going to continue to come 
out of colombia he said 
azzam estimated the seizure of the 293seat jet cost the airline 
40000 to 50000 a day 
avianca airlines of colombia stopped cargo flights from bogota to 
miami four months ago because of millions of dollars in fines it has 
been forced to pay in this country as a result of cocaine shipments

sole intent of killing wiggins after learning he tested positive for 
the aids virus 
i confronted wiggins i said hey you gave me the aids

face about it ford said i gave this lady friend that means a 
lot to me the aids virus and all he could do was laugh in my face

the government has pledged to keep the pint and the 
mile but says that from gills and gallons to feet and fathoms 
virtually all the rest of britains traditional weights and measures 
system will vanish in the 1990s 
detailing the latest draft directive from the european economic 
community on converting britain to continental europes metric 
system corporate affairs minister francis maude said tuesday that 
the government sees no grounds for making unnecessary changes 
were not going to have to remeasure the cricket pitch he 
declared in a statement designed to reassure britons over the 
planned conversion to the metric system 
cricket pitches will indeed stay the same length 22 yards but 
measurements in yards inches and feet will be phased out by the end 
of 1994 and replaced by meters centimeters and millimeters under 
the terms of the draft directive 
the directive was issued by the brusselsbased executive 
commission of the 12nation eec to which britain belongs 
other units from what is known as britains imperial system of 
weights and measures that will vanish under the terms of the draft 
directive include the gill the fluid ounce and the fathom 
a gill is the equivalent of a quarter pint a fluid ounce is a 
measure of capacity containing an avoirdupois ounce of distilled 
water at 62 degrees the fathom six feet which is used to measure 
ocean depths is already being phased out by the royal navy but its 
use will be allowed until 1999 
maude said the draft directive was broadly acceptable to the 
government it provides for exemption of the traditional pint for 
draught beer and cider in pubs and for milk in returnable bottles 
and for the troy ounce 
the troy ounce used to measure gold and other precious metals 
is crucial to londonbased bullion trading operations 
maude said that to avoid wasting an estimated 12 billion 
returnable bottles in circulation for drinks other than milk the 
government is seeking arrangements to allow the continued use of 
imperialmeasure bottles until the end of 1999 
he said the government is also committed to keeping the mile as a 
measure for distance and speed on signposts and speedometers 
he said the furlong a distance used in horse racing would also 
stay because it was used only in a sporting context and was 
therefore not covered by the draft directive a furlong is an eighth 
of a mile 
but for trade in fruit vegetables meat and other items the 
pound and the ounce will be replaced by the kilogram and the gram 
in 1965 britain first committed itself to going metric the 
system devised by the paris academy of sciences in 1791 which is now 
in force throughout continental europe 
british youngsters learn the metric system at school many goods 
in british supermarkets show both the metric and traditional british 
measure side by side and some business like measuring materials in 
dry goods stores is done entirely in the metric system 
britains traditional system stems from its days of empire when 
it turned its back of continental europe and went its own way 
britain joined the european economic community in 1973 
this does not mean that the united kingdom will suddenly lose 
all its imperial traditions but it does mean that over the next five 
or six years we will see some changes in the way goods are sold in 
the shops maude said 
in matters which are entirely domestic to the united kingdom we 
see no reason why we cannot continue to use imperial units where 
they are customary he added 
there have been efforts to put the united states on the metric 
system for more than a decade including 1975 legislation but 
progress has been slow not everyone is thrilled with the idea 
especially some powerful business lobbying groups 
under a law enacted in august the us government is required to 
start doing business with its private suppliers under the metric 
system starting in 1992

a lowerranking diplomat at saudi arabias 
embassy was assassinated on the steps of his apartment building 
ankara gov saffet arikan beduk said today 
beduk said abdulgani bedawi was shot to death by unknown gunmen 
tuesday night in front of his apartment building in affluent cankaya 
district bedawi who was returning from the office died instantly 
from shots to the head and chest beduk said 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility 
saudi arabian ambassador abdulaziz khojah said the killing 
could not possibly be a result of personal conflict or for 
burglary he said however that the embassy had received more 
than 100 threatening letters written in turkish during the spring 
holy pilgrimage season 
i dont believe the turks have anything to do with the incident 
even though the letters were in turkish khojah said without 
elaborating 
saudi arabia restricted the number of moslems who could visit the 
country during the pilgrimage season this year according to each 
moslem nations population 
the decision was taken as a security measure after last years 
riot by iranians during the pilgrimage to mecca that claimed the 
lives of more than 400 iranians 
saudi arabia broke diplomatic ties with iran in april the saudi 
government then announced that the decision had several reasons 
among them the clash in mecca and a subsequent attack on the saudi 
embassy in tehran 
khojah said bedawi worked as a telex operator in the embassy the 
envoy confirmed that he was working under diplomatic status with 
the title of second secretary bedawi had been appointed to his job 
six years ago

doctors and nurses face a oneinathousand 
risk of catching aids when they get infected blood or other body 
fluids on their skin even though gloves they wear for protection 
often leak studies found 
gloves have been leaking for years weve been wearing them and 
we havent found a lot of infections in hospital employees exposed 
to aids hepatitis b and other viruses said jane 
degrootkosolcharoen an infection control nurse at middleton 
memorial veterans hospital in madison wis 
three studies conducted by degrootkosolcharoen and researchers 
in massachusetts and florida found leakage in more than half of some 
of the brands of gloves tested one study was conducted as an 
eighthgrade science project by a student whose father is an 
infectious disease expert 
the studies found wide variations in leakage rates for various 
brands of latex and vinyl gloves but tended to show sterile 
surgical gloves less leakprone than nonsterile examination gloves 
and latex less leakprone than vinyl 
a fourth study concluded blood sputum urine and other body 
fluids of aids patients gets on the skin of health care workers 
far too frequently with about onequarter of a group of 770 
hospital employees getting aidstainted liquids on their skin 
but the chance of one such exposure infecting a person with the 
virus for acquired immune deficiency syndrome is no more than 11 in 
1000 said barbara fahey an infection control specialist who 
performed the study at the national institutes of health clinical 
center in bethesda md 
a related study by nih epidemiologist david henderson found 
health care workers face a one in 250 chance of catching aids from a 
single instance of being jabbed by a contaminated needle and a one 
in 300 chance of being infected if virustainted liquid comes in 
contact with their mucous membranes 
there really is a risk we all have to swallow its a bitter 
pill henderson said tuesday during the 28th interscience 
conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy 
however the nih studies showed health care workers got 
aidstainted fluids on their skin far more often than they contacted 
such liquids through their mucous membranes or needle injuries 
researchers at the conference said hospital workers should check 
gloves for holes before using them then wash their hands after 
removing gloves 
degrootkosolcharoen said recommendations for health care workers 
to wear gloves to protect themselves from aids and other viruses 
caused a nationwide glove shortage and that manufacturers have had 
difficulty supplying enough gloves without compromising quality 
she performed waterleak tests on 2400 gloves from 24 brands of 
gloves in a second test the gloves were donned by researchers and 
dipped in blood they donated 
of the 24 brands only four didnt leak at all they were sterile 
latex gloves up to 52 percent of gloves in some brands leaked 
degrootkosolcharoen said 
average leak rates for water and blood respectively were 11 
percent and 11 percent for sterile latex 9 percent and 95 percent 
for sterile vinyl 14 percent and 9 percent for nonsterile latex 
and most leaky 177 percent and 103 percent for nonsterile 
vinyl 
university of massachusetts medical center infection control 
research director helen rosen kotilainen tested 1200 vinyl and 
1750 latex nonsterile examination gloves from seven brands 
waterleak rates for ranged from 4 percent to 28 percent for 
vinyl brands and from 0 percent to 6 percent for latex brands

president chadli benjedid has rejected 
transition to a multiparty democracy as part of political reforms 
announced after bloody riots earlier this month 
in a communique issued by his office monday night benjedid said 
the ruling party the national liberation front would become more 
democratic and party officials would be made more accountable to the 
rank and file 
the communique said the party had to listen more atentively to 
the people to understand their concerns 
the unrest spurred by algerias economic crisis began with 
demonstrators protesting food shortages and rising prices 
the party which has ruled the country since independence from 
france in 1962 was already unpopular and has been silent since the 
disturbances which left 159 people dead and 154 injured according 
to official figures 
unofficial estimates at the time put the number of dead at 400 or 
more 
the communique said a multisystem cannot be established with 
groups who seek power and privileges under the facade of democracy 
however the communique said rejuvenation of the ruling party 
does not exclude the possibility that eventually there could be a 
pluralistic system 
it said there will be elections to most party posts and 
nonmembers could run for election to popular assemblies 
the measures are to be put before a party congress in december 
and then to a referendum next year 
in another referendum next week algerians will vote on a plan to 
make the prime minister answerable to the national assembly

plundered more than 100 million from their homeland to buy real 
estate and other properties in new york they are to be arraigned 
monday in new york 
john bartko marcos san franciscobased attorney said attorneys 
sought the honolulu arraignment because of the 71yearold marcos 
poor health and the simplicity of the proceeding 
basically all they are required to do is show up and enter a 
plea which in this case of course would be not guilty said 
bartko considering mr marcos poor health and the fact that it 
would be a very long trip and require numerous medical personnel we 
hope to have the site changed 
marcos has been treated for a variety of illnesses during his 
exile in hawaii including chest pains and an eye ailment he and 
his wife imelda fled to honolulu in february 1986 after a 
civilianmilitary revolt ended his 20year rule 
bartko said he hoped to know by thursday or friday whether the 
change would be granted

the trip and that they did not require federal law enforcement

would be no more namecalling in his campaign one day after calling 
his opponent a fairy queen 
john sheppard said his comment about oregon secretary of state 
barbara roberts at a news conference was aimed at her opposition to 
a ballot issue but was misunderstood 
the measure would repeal gov neil goldschmidts executive order 
barring state agenices from discrimination based on sexual 
preference repeal supporters say goldschmidts order grants 
homosexuals special protection even though it also applies to 
heterosexuals 
sheppard had called goldschmidt a bozo for issuing the order 
and said monday that if goldschmidt is the chief bozo barbara 
roberts can be crowned the fairy queen 
on tuesday sheppard promised you wont see any of that 
again 
sheppard a republican said the comment was not the choice of 
words i would have used claiming he was reading from a news 
release written by his campaign manager sheppard however declined 
to apologize for the remark 
roberts a democrat said sheppards comment represented a new

police and soldiers conducted 
body searches on black voters outside cape town as south africans of 
all races voted today in segregated municipal elections 
president pw bothas ruling party was expected to lose ground 
to extreme rightwing opponents in white cities and a light turnout 
was reported in black townships where antiapartheid activists urged 
a vote boycott in defiance of the governments state of emergency 
regulations 
state radio south africa reported 1946 candidates for the 7229 
town council seats were elected unopposed it noted fewer than half 
the 1839 black township council seats were being contested with no 
candidates for 138 seats 
black white asian and mixedrace voters cast ballots today 
marking the first time all four major race groups in south africa 
voted on the same day 
antiapartheid activists such as archbishop desmond tutu winner 
of the 1984 nobel peace prize called for a national day of protest 
today such calls usually include a general strike 
but most black townships appeared normal except for heightened 
police patrols and the presence of armed security forces around 
polling booths and transportation facilities 
police said gasoline bombs were thrown during the night at the 
homes of three candidates in soweto the countrys largest black 
township outside johannesburg also a limpet mine exploded in a 
beer hall in soweto but there were no injuries 
two black candidates had been killed during the campaign one 
monday night outside port elizabeth the other in august in soweto 
many schools in soweto were closed because of poor attendance 
officials said and black students writing exams in umlazi outside 
durban were fired on buses and trains were stoned in the black 
township of claremont outside durban 
voting was extremely slow in many black areas around cape town 
with one or two voters showing up by midday at some polling places 
but poll workers said more than 1000 voters turned out in 
khayelitsha where police were seen conducting body searches of 
people entering the polling area 
critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually 
meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and no 
candidates linked to major antiapartheid groups are running 
most leading opposition groups are banned and most activists 
view black town councils as subservient extensions of the 
whitecontrolled central government 
truckloads of police were posted at the polling booth in mayfair 
a white suburb of johannesburg where nonwhites have begun living 
illegally 
in soweto police with rifles stood around polling booths 
soldiers and police on motorcycles and horses were stationed near 
the police station 
bombings and hand grenade attacks have averaged more than one a 
day in south africa since september police say the attacks are part 
of a campaign by the outlawed african national congress guerrilla 
movement to disrupt the elections 
a car bomb killed three black men and injured 18 on monday in the 
town of witbank east of johannesburg 
on tuesday riot police used tear gas and clubs to disperse more 
than 1000 activists at university of the witwatersrand in 
johannesburg who were calling for an election boycott 
there were no injuries in that incident but about 30 high school 
students in cape town similarly protesting the elections suffered 
slight injuries in a clash tuesday with clubwielding police school 
officials said 
the government had sought a high turnout to bolster its claim 
that it is broadening democracy in south africa 
in the white elections bothas national party was in a showdown 
with the staunchly proapartheid conservative party the 
conservatives were predicting they could capture the city council in 
pretoria the capital 
the conservatives who see bothas gradual race reforms as 
capitulation to the black majority seek to reimpose strict 
segregation throughout south africa 
the conservatives won 26 percent of the vote in the national 
elections of may 1987 and claim they could seriously challenge the 
national party in parliamentary elections expected by early 1990 
in the black elections less than 500000 of the countrys 26 
million blacks were expected to vote despite a massive government 
advertising campaign to promote black turnout about 24 million 
blacks are registered to vote in municipal elections but blacks 
have no vote in national elections 
in 1983 when black municipal elections were last held 21 
percent of the registered voters cast ballots and about the same 
expected this time 
low turnouts also were expected in asian and colored or 
mixedrace townships asians and mixedrace people have their own 
houses in the tricameral parliament as do the whites 
stateofemergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a range of statements the 
government considers subversive enforcement of the regulations has 
not been comprehensive

the press credentials of three british 
journalists were suspended on allegations they violated military 
censorship by failing to submit reports about undercover israeli 
army units in the occupied territories 
yoram ettinger head of the government press office said the 
credentials of paul taylor and steve weizman of the reuters news 
agency and andrew whitley of the financial times were suspended 
tuesday pending an investigation 
government and army officials will not grant interviews to the 
three while their credentials are suspended 
there is an obvious violation of security regulations without 
relevance to the authenticity of the information ettinger told 
reporters censorship officials said police would investigate 
depending on what the police find they could file charges 
under israeli law journalists must submit reports relating to 
security matters to military censors the government has not clearly 
defined security matters and leaves submission of reports to the 
discretion of correspondents 
a reuters story written by weizman on sunday said undercover army 
units had unusual orders to shoot palestinians suspected of 
organizing violent demonstrations 
we stand by the story said taylor 34 the reuter bureau 
chief in israel 
whitleys story of oct 11 said undercover troops used arab cars 
and posed as journalists to detain suspected rioters 
whitley 39 said he didnt feel he violated censorship because 
he based his report on previously published material he also noted 
he reported on the undercover units in the context of a larger story 
about stronger steps taken by the army to quell the palestinian 
uprising well into its 11th month 
i dont believe i endangered israels security by exposing 
dirty tricks in the west bank but i believe my security is 
endangered by these people posing as journalists whitley told the 
associated press 
the army said monday units carry out varied operational 
activities to preserve security and order in accordance with the 
law there is no unit in the idf israeli defense force or army 
which is authorized to act or which acts against the wellknown 
rules for opening fire which are grounded in the law 
taylor has worked for reuters for 11 years weizman 34 who has 
dual israelibritish citizenship has worked for reuters in israel 
for 18 months 
whitley has worked for the financial times for 11 years the last 
three years in israel 
six months ago the government press office suspended the press 
credentials of martin fletcher of nbc news and glenn frankel of the 
washington post for not submitting to the censor reports alleging 
that israel carried out the assassination of plo military commander 
khalil wazir in his tunis home april 16 israeli sources confirmed 
the reports but the government refused comment 
both reporters later had their credentials restored 
the foreign press association protested the latest suspensions

five men were indicted on federal charges they 
plotted to import thousands of pounds of cocaine including a 
reputed colombian drug lord who made death threats against mayor 
edward i koch officials say 
the indictment tuesday of gonzalo rodriguez gacha and four others 
reaches into the highest echelon of the multibilliondollar 
medellin cartel said us attorney andrew maloney 
according to the indictment by a federal grand jury in brooklyn 
the five conspired with undercover agents posing as drug brokers to 
bring 2200 pounds of cocaine into the new york area every eight 
days 
robert stutman head of the us drug enforcement 
administrations office here said his agency received reports from 
colombia that rodriguez gacha had made death threats against koch 
stutman and other law enforcement officials 
three colombians arrested here thursday had an electronic device 
that could have been used to set off explosives by remote control 
officials said informers identified the three as assassins 
because of insufficient evidence one was released and two were 
held only on charges of violating immigration law 
if i am not safe who is said koch that is what is 
horrifying the more they threaten the more well go after 
them said stutman who described rodriguez gacha as the most 
active member of the cocaine cartel based in the northern colombian 
city of medellin 
it is unlikely rodriguez gacha will be prosecuted federal 
authorities said because his south american homeland does not have 
an extradition treaty with the united states 
another defendant identified as a lieutenant in the cartel oscar 
vegas also lives in colombia 
the other three defendants identified as employees of the 
cartels new york operation were arrested july 23 when federal 
agents seized 1350 pounds of cocaine near la guardia airport the 
first shipment in the sting operation 
rodriguez gacha vegas jaime posado 28 of queens jaime 
pineda 29 of queens and juan luis velez 26 were charged with 
operating a continuing criminal enterprise conspiracy to import 
cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine 
if convicted the defendants could be sentenced to life in prison 
and fined 6 million each 
a separate indictment in miami charged rodriguez gacha and six 
others with one count of conspiracy to import cocaine

at least 143 people survived the 
sinking of a ship during typhoon ruby many swimming for hours 
through raging seas to reach safety on small islands officials said 
today 
ships and helicopters searched the area today in hopes of finding 
hundreds more left missing when the 2855ton dona marilyn sank 
monday with more than 500 people aboard 
a shipping executive said survivors struggled onto lifeboats or 
jumped overboard as the vessel heaved in the stormwhipped visayan 
sea it sank about 300 miles southeast of manila 
everybody was jumping into the sea said bernardo cabigon 
tacloban station manager of sulpicio lines which owned the dona 
marilyn others took the lifeboats but there were so many people 
that they decided to jump and swim they looked very tired they 
stayed in the water for three hours 
cabrigon said 120 of the 143 survivors managed to reach the 
small remote island of almagro with lifejackets and life boats 
in cebu sulpicio president carlos go said 13 other survivors 
were found by rescuers on other islands and in the choppy seas 
there were unconfirmed reports scores of others may have reached 
safety on another island 
im expecting more survivors we have not called off 
operations cabigon said 
president corazon aquino ordered an investigation into the 
sinking she also declared a state of calamity in manila and 35 
provinces hardest hit by typhoon ruby which killed at least 103 
people elsewhere in the philippines monday and tuesday 
last december another sulpicio ship the dona paz collided with 
an oil tanker off mindoro island only 28 people survived and more 
than 3000 were believed to have perished in the worlds biggest 
peacetime shipping disaster 
cabrigon said the bodies of 26 victims washed ashore at almagro 
the coast guard said another body was found today in nearby waters 
almagros mayor raul escalante said he had buried 18 of the 
decomposing victims in a common grave 
the dona marilyn left manila on sunday bound for tacloban but was 
buffeted monday by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph cabigon 
said the coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listing 
in heavy seas in a radioed distress signal before the ship went down 
cabigon quoted survivor alberto oledo as saying he jumped from 
the stricken ship with his wife son and daughter the three held 
hands but were separated in the raging seas cabigon said oledo 
managed to reach maripipi but there was no trace of his wife and 
children 
in a second smaller rescue effort the us navy said the uss 
blue ridge found four crewmen of the 300foot philippine freighter 
jet nann five which sank about 150 miles south of where the marilyn 
is believed to have gone down 
a us navy spokesman at the subic naval base said the blue ridge 
was still searching for the vessels 15 other crewmen he quoted 
survivors as saying the jet nann five capsized 12 hours after

the turnout in the presidential election is 
expected to be one of the lowest this century continuing a trend of 
declining voter participation in a nation that prides itself as a 
beacon of western democracy say political analysts 
public interest groups are warning that only 50 percent or less 
of the eligible voters will go to the polls on nov 8 about the 
same as the record low 49 percent turnout in the 1924 presidential 
election 
the declining turnout down from a record high 79 percent in 
1896 puts the united states at the bottom of the voter 
participation list in the worlds democratic systems 
belgium heads the average voter participation list with 95 
percent while the united states ranks last with 53 percent and 
ireland second to last at 62 percent according to figures compiled 
by frances fox piven and richard cloward in their book why 
americans dont vote 
the turnout in the last election the 1984 contest between 
president reagan and democrat walter f mondale was 533 percent of 
the votingage population that was the lowest turnout since the 
511 percent who gave harry truman an upset victory over republican 
thomas dewey in 1948 
most political scientists attribute the low american 
participation to the requirement that voters register days or weeks 
before they cast their ballot in contrast registration in west 
european democracies is generally automatic with the voter 
receiving a notice in the mail 
in fact american registration procedures are byzantine 
compared with those that prevail in other democracies said piven 
and cloward 
walter dean burnham an expert on voter participation says that 
without the twostep hurdle of registration and voting turnout 
would increase 8 to 10 percent figures show that 87 percent of 
those who do register go to the polls on election day 
other reasons cited by analysts for low participation include the 
declining power of the political party system the generally 
apolitical nature of the electorate and television which tends to 
focus on personalities rather than parties 
as a result people dont feel very represented and its not 
very important for them to vote said burnham a professor of 
government at the university of texas at austin 
political parties in europe are far more homogeneous than the 
democratic or republican parties in the united states making it 
easier for voters to take sides and for the parties to target 
constituents said g bingham powell chairman of the school of 
government at the university of rochester 
many americans do not identify with either of the two major 
parties said powell who studies the difference between the us 
and european political systems 
scholars also note that among the nonvoters about 75 percent are 
lowincome less educated americans who do not feel represented by 
the existing system and are generally less likely to vote 
others believe the decline in voter participation stems from the 
general attitude of many americans 
not voting is a reflection of the fact that were relatively 
content with life sated with our lifestyles said michael 
robinson a georgetown university scholar people dont see any 
reason to vote and change this 
and many analysts contend that the george bushmichael dukakis 
race has focused heavily on negative campaigning further alienating 
voters 
if all you see every night is dukakis bashing bush or vice 
versa why would you rush out to vote for them they dont address 
issues whats the point said curtis gans who heads the 
nonpartisan committee for the study of the american electorate 
other political scientists attribute the drop of voters to the 
multilevel system of local elections gubernatorial and state 
legislature elections congressional elections and the presidential 
election 
people are baffled by the system they dont feel their vote 
can make any difference to their childrens school or the state of 
the local roads gans said 
turnout for local and congressional elections is about 20 to 30 
percent lower than for presidential elections 
theres an incredible degree of apoliticality in this country 
compared to europe said burnham in fact people regard the 
campaign as just another horse race it comes along with the 
baseball season and football seasons people participate vicariously 
at home but dont feel they need to go out and join in

the polish government is willing to make 
concessions to the roman catholic church in hopes of obtaining full 
diplomatic recognition from the holy see vatican sources said today 
at recent talks at the vatican the polish government presented a 
revised version of a longstanding proposal that would offer the 
church greater freedoms and rights said the sources they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
they said no decisions were made and further negotiations are not 
expected before january 
the sources familar with the vaticans eastern european policy 
said the polish government for some time has been seeking to 
reestablish formal relations which were broken when the communists 
took power after world war ii 
the government proposal is believed to include legal guarantees 
for the church agreement to allow lay catholic groups and promises 
to end restrictions on the catholic press such as in the supply of 
newsprint 
one source said the proposals werent contingent on the granting 
of full recognition but that it is known the government would 
welcome the gesture from the vatican 
it is believed that such a move by the vatican would bolster 
polish leaders in their attempt to deal with internal dissent 
however some vatican officials are skeptical about such a move 
at this time and polishborn pope john paul ii has stressed the 
need to make such relations credible in the eyes of the polish 
people and the world 
polands roman catholic bishops have long sought a statute for 
the church to protect it from the whims of various leaders 
the church has traditionally played an important role in poland 
and supported the solidarity labor movement which was outlawed 
after the government declared martial law in december 1981 
church representatives have been invited to attend talks with the 
government and political opposition those talks were agreed to in 
august by the government in return for labor leaders ending strikes 
across the country 
the start of the talks have been snagged by government objections 
to two delegates proposed by solidarity

an aeroperu jetliner carrying 69 people 
crashed on an andean plain in southwestern peru killing 12 people 
officials said more people would have died if the pilot had not 
swerved to avoid a hill 
the stateowned airline said an american and three europeans were 
among those killed tuesday when the twinjet fokker28 filled to 
capacity with 65 passengers and a crew of four slammed into a flood 
plain a minute after takeoff 
aeroperu spokesman freddy chirinos said 44 people were injured 
one person was unaccounted for he said 
many victims died from burns suffered after the plane split in 
three pieces on impact and the tail section burst into flames 
officials said wreckage was scattered across a half acre of pasture 
and a riverbed 
the jet had taken off from the manco capac airport in juliaca 
which is more than 12000 feet above sea level near lake titicaca in 
southern peru 
chirinos said at least 19 foreigners mainly tourists returning 
from the lake were aboard the craft flight 771 was en route to 
lima 540 miles northwest with a stop in arequipa 
aeroperu identified the foreign dead as douglas harris of the 
united states kurt lenz of switzerland and ervert and ingeborg 
psiller of france it gave no hometowns for the victims 
survivors and witnesses on the ground said the aircraft lost 
altitude seconds into the flight but regained it before crashing 
alongside the cabanillas river one mile northwest of the airport 
transportation minister camilo carrillo told reporters in juliaca 
that pilot fernando bellina who survived averted greater disaster 
by swerving the stricken craft to avoid a hill and crash landing on 
flood plain sand which absorbed some of the impact 
congressman rolando avila another survivor said the aircraft 
had flown only about 400 yards after takeoff when an explosion shook 
it and the jets cut off 
the pilots apparently tried to level off to land and the plane 
scraped the roofs of some adobe homes before falling he said 
airline officials would not speculate on what caused the crash 
they said an investigation was under way 
cesar atala a director of the pilots association of aeroperu 
said the union might call a strike today to protest airline 
maintenance practices he reiterated the associations charge that 
aeroperus fleet of 10 jetliners is in poor shape due to a shortage 
of spare parts 
but johnny cabrere an aeroperu air cargo employee in new york 
said flights were operating today were operating normally he 
said 
peru suffering through a severe economic crisis is virtually 
out of dollar reserves to import spare parts for much of its 
industry 
the last major air accident in peru occurred dec 9 when a 
twinengine navy fokker f27 crashed off limas pacific coast 
killing 44 people including nearly the entire squad of perus 
leading soccer team alianza lima 
chirinos identified the injured foreigners as elizabeth dunning 
catherine kanskey francois savoir michael reilly bernard mahoney 
and mark kranki of the united states luana and rafael gianinazzi of 
italy albert koyson and brigitte kahson of france walter kabin of 
great britain joacy borge of brazil and esther and ana lopez and 
gina garfias of spain 
the us embassy said it had no information on dead or injured 
americans

the government refused soviet access 
to a shipyard next to subic bay naval base because of us fears the 
soviets would spy on the american facility an official said today 
our policy is not to allow the soviets access to the 
philippine shipyard and engineering corp the governments news 
agency quoted manuel yan undersecretary of foreign affairs as 
saying 
they are allowed to repair ships in other shipyards but not 
there yan added 
he noted that the philippines had rejected previous soviet 
requests to use the shipyard which is on subic bay next to the 
american facility yan did not say when the soviets last made such a 
request 
us officials in washington said last week the soviets had asked 
to use the shipyard 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
were worried manila might grant the request because the shipyard is 
losing money and because of dissatisfaction over recent negotiations 
on the lease covering us military bases in the philippines 
last week the two countries signed an agreement under which the 
united states will pay 962 million in military and economic aid for 
use of the bases in 1991 and 1992 
philippine officials wanted up to 23 billion a year for use of 
the six bases

atlantic salmon are swimming in the 
shetucket river for the first time in about 150 years 
state department of environmental protection workers on tuesday 
released some 200 salmon as part of a program aimed at reintroducing 
the oncenative fish into the thames river and its tributaries 
atlantic salmon were once plentiful in the rivers of southeastern 
connecticut powergeneration dams along the rivers first installed 
in the mid1800s prevented the salmon from swimming to their 
spawning grounds 
the effort to reintroduce the fish if successful would be not 
only a victory for conservationists but also a boon for the local 
economy as fishermen journey to the region for the chance to catch 
the prized fish 
when oswego county in new york reintroduced salmon into its 
rivers early this decade tourists pumped an additional 7 million 
to 8 million into the economy annually according to studies 
ronald r whiteley president of the thames river watershed 
association said some of the salmon probably will begin migrating 
down the thames on a 6000mile trip to the waters of greenland and 
back 
the earliest the fish would return would be 1990 by then 
whiteley said it is hoped a fish ladder at greeneville dam will be 
completed to allow the fish to continue upstream to natural spawning 
grounds in shallow waters 
however the restocking effort will not succeed until fish 
ladders are installed at two dams farther north it could take 
decades for the river to become a natural habitat again for the 
salmon whiteley said 
but tuesday was a start the fish were trucked to the banks of 
the river then unloaded by net into large plastic barrels workers 
carried the barrels to the waters edge and dumped the fish into the 
river the salmon are identified with yellow tags attached to a fin 
the fish about two to three pounds apiece were raised in the 
kensington state salmon hatchery in berlin

palestinians misread a date on smudged 
underground leaflets and went on strike by mistake today in parts of 
the occupied territories and jerusalem 
seven arab youths were reported shot and wounded meanwhile in 
clashes between stonethrowers and israeli troops today in the 
occupied territories 
strikers closed most businesses and schools and paralyzed 
transportation in much of the occupied gaza strip most gazan arabs 
who work in israel stayed home according to arab reports 
some stores in arab east jerusalem and parts of hebron a city in 
the occupied west bank also were closed but transportation was 
operating normally in both places 
in parts of the west bank young people who normally enforce 
strikes visited merchants on tuesday to explain that the strike was 
supposed to be on saturday oct 29 not today oct 26 the figures 
for nine and six look similar in arabic writing and smudged 
printing on some of the leaflets caused the confusion 
the leaflets were issued by the united national leadership of the 
uprising which regularly orders strikes as a tactic in the revolt 
against israeli rule of the territories captured in the 1967 middle 
east war 
at least 303 palestinians and six israelis have been killed 
during the uprising which began dec 8 more than 7000 
palestinians have been wounded according to the israeli government 
in nablus the west banks largest city three palestinian 
teenagers were shot today in three separate stonethrowing 
confrontations hospital officials said a 20yearold man also was 
admitted to a hospital after he was shot during a clash in the 
tulkarem refugee camp the officials said 
in the gaza strip two 15yearold boys were shot with plastic 
bullets in separate clashes with soldiers in the sabra neighborhood 
of gaza city and in the jabaliya refugee camp arab reporters and 
hospital officials said israeli troops have begun using the plastic 
bullets because they are less apt to kill 
an 18yearold man was wounded in the leg with a plastic bullet 
when troops opened fire in rafah hospital officials said 
the israeli army said it could not confirm the reports of 
shootings 
also today the army imposed curfews on seven gaza refugee camps 
and a neighborhood of gaza city troops wrecked five palestinian 
houses in the gaza towns of khan yunis and rafah as part of their 
effort to put down the revolt

the cabinet of one of the countrys 
six republics resigned during a debate over its crackdown on an 
antigovernment protest news media reported today 
the resignation in the southern republic of montenegro came 
tuesday after the republics parliament opened debate on whether its 
government and presidency overstepped authority in using police to 
put down the demonstation earlier this month the reports said 
the montenegrin government said it was stepping down after five 
of its 20 members including interior minister lazar djodjic lost a 
vote of confidence during the parliamentary session the belgrade 
daily newspaper politika said today 
the government decided to submit its collective resignation 
because it could not operate in the complex situation in which 
five ministers lost the vote politika quoted premier vuko 
vukadinovic as saying the nineman presidency however won a vote 
of confidence tuesday 
the parliament after its 12hour session late tuesday postponed 
consideration of whether to accept the governments resignation and 
reconvened today belgrade news media reported 
at least 10 people were injured and 12 arrested earlier this 
month in titograd the capital of montenegro when police used tear 
gas to disperse demonstrators protesting falling living standards 
yugoslavia is suffering its worst economic crisis with 217 
percent annual inflation 15 percent unemployment and steadily 
declining living standards 
the titograd demonstrators were also demanding an end to what 
they view as persecution of the minority slav population by ethnic 
albanians in the neighboring province of kosovo 
the economic and ethnic issues have combined to give rise to 
unrest and calls for an overhaul of communist party leadership 
across yugoslavia in recent months leaders in vojvodina the 
nations other province were forced out earlier this month both 
kosovo and vojvodina though nominally autonomous are partly 
controlled by the republic of serbia 
the decentralized system of government and a collective federal 
presidency were devised in the late president josip broz titos 1974 
constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the 
others but it has resulted in an ineffective government by 
compromise 
in recent months serbia began to work on plans to amend its 
constitution to strengthen control over kosovo where ethnic 
albanians make up nearly 90 percent of the population

whidmeyer spokesman for ben taub hospital 
he said a very educated guess is that the cocaine was heavily 
laced with boric acid adding theres some coke out there thats 
playing russian roulette 
cocaine sometimes is cut with other substances so dealers can 
sell more of the illegal drug 
boric acid is a white cystalline compound and is used as a mild 
antiseptic to manufacture cements and enamels and to kill roaches 
experts say it also can cause cardiovascular shock 
those who died apparently had injected the drug and two of them 
told doctors they thought they had gotten some bad cocaine 
whidmeyer said they complained of tremendous dehydration heart 
palpitations and nausea 
they were scared he said 
two of those taken to ben taub died monday and the third died 
during the night all unofficially from cardiac arrest and renal 
failure whidmeyer said the fourth person died monday at another 
hospital 
autopsies were being performed on the four victims and the fifth 
man was in stable condition late tuesday at ben taub he said

sweden has refused asylum for 10 soviet 
defectors and ordered them back to their homeland saying they no 
longer qualify as political refugees because of soviet reforms an 
official said today 
an immigration board official mikael broman said each case was 
appealed and is under review 
in the past swedish authorities routinely granted soviet 
defectors the right to stay in sweden but broman said the board 
changed its position due to the developments in the soviet union 
he was referring to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
campaigns for glasnost and perestroika or openness and 
restructuring 
the official said the board relying on assessments from the 
swedish embassy in moscow and other soviet sources ruled the 
defectors did not risk danger if they returned 
broman cited cases of defectors who returned to the soviet union 
for visits without incident 
we have established one case where the person has been back 
five times then you are not a refugee in the legal sense 
broman said

restraining order obtained by the producers of midnight caller

police officers until filming was called off at 8 pm 
aids foundation spokesman rene durazzo said protesters do not 
object to an episode about the aids epidemic but want an accurate 
portrayal of the aids crisis not an episode they fear will 
promote irrational fear and ignorance 
protesters say the show could incite violence against aids 
victims 
the show which has been filming here for several weeks features 
a detective who becomes a radio talk show host the controversial 
episode concerns a man with aids who continues to have unsafe sex 
until a former lover kills him 
the producers said they already have made plot changes to show

george bush has virtually claimed an election victory in florida 
and urged sunshine state voters to underscore their support by 
helping the gop regain control of the senate

florida voters to give bush a partner in the us senate by 
electing republican rep connie mack iii who is locked in a close 
race with democratic rep buddy mackay to succeed retiring sen

connie mack in the us senate 
even though the republicans are given little if any chance of 
capturing senate control quayle noted the presidents difficulties 
in dealing with a congress dominated by the opposition party 
when youre in the minority the majority controls the gavel 
theyre able to set the agenda in congress he said 
it was the first time that quayle had diverted his campaign 
schedule to lend his support in a senate race but he also took the 
occasion to take another swipe at bushs presidential rival 
democrat michael dukakis 
quayle said dukakis statement at the democratic convention that 
the 1988 election is about competence rather than ideology marked 
a closing chapter in liberalism in this country 
they said right up front folks we dont want to talk about 
it the indiana senator said they dont want to talk about 
their ideas 
after the fundraiser quayle toured a honeywell plant where 
components for the space shuttle and trident missile systems are 
manufactured

actively encouraging his campaign surrogates to dish out political 
sludge against the gop ticket

community and fort lauderdale before heading to north carolina and 
later in the week to new jersey new york and pennsylvania

bush with a 13point lead over dukakis quayle said the race is 
not over its a good sign its a positive development who knows 
what will happen in these last two weeks 
the vice presidential candidate also said we are confident we 
are going to win but were not overconfident

plane to tampa fla

pregnant she would elect to have the baby and not have the abortion

choice i told her what i would like but its her choice i cant 
tell my wife what to do in that situation 
she would have that choice under the law as it is now 
written he said 
he added that he does not however support that law and favors 
allowing each state to determine its own guidelines on abortion 
in another interview quayle told a persistent young reporter 
from a childrens news program he would rather she had a baby than 
abort the fetus if she became pregnant through her father 
thats a difficult question and one that does not have an easy 
answer but my answer would be yes quayle told an 11yearold 
reporter for chidrens express during a bus tour of illinois 
last week 
the questionandanswer session was broadcast tuesday on the cbs

the wenatchee wash world on child care 
a heretofore groggy corporate america is finally waking up to the 
depth and breadth of the child care issue thats because valuable 
employees many of them women are increasingly weighing child care 
options as they decide where to work 
the issue is getting its first serious governmental attention as 
the reality sinks in that more and more households are inevitably 
going to be twoworker situations recognition of that fact at the 
private corporate level is no doubt helping to spur government 
interest 
just one thing while all these efforts to create better 
situations for children and parents are laudable we need to keep 
in mind that families who decide to have one parent stay home to 
raise the kids themselves and thereby sacrifice that second income 
ought not to be penalized in any way by tax writeoffs or tax 
increases which are not equitably applied

the oak ridger oak ridge tenn on the department of veterans 
affairs 
ronald reagan campaigned in 1980 on a theme of getting big 
government off the backs of the american people part of that 
campaign included proposals to abolish the two newest cabinet 
departments energy and education 
those plans have long since been dropped and the departments are 
flourishing bureaucracies 
the senate recently gave final approval of a new department of 
veterans affairs in effect elevating the veterans administration to 
cabinet status 
each time a cabinet department is added it means new and often 
duplicated expense and with the new status the departments begin 
to grow far beyond their previous bounds 
of course in an election year its not likely that anybody would 
oppose creation of a department of veterans affairs that might 
smack of being antiveteran 
what we are likely to see is a new tangle of rules and 
regulations as the bureaucrats carve out their niches in the new 
department 
and veterans like nonveterans will help foot the bill through 
taxes

would only lead to additional terrorist acts perhaps more

bridgeton nj evening news on separating education and 
religion 
the woodstown school board has a problem as a group of 
parents seeks the ouster of a teacher they say attempted to 
teach religion when she advised her pupils that celebrating 
halloween was the work of satan 
that same first amendment that bans the teacher from advocating 
any religious belief in the classroom grants her the right to 
opinion and to express it in public if she so wishes but she may 
not express it in the classroom where she might influence children 
of others who hold different beliefs 
halloween the night before all saints day in most christian 
churches only in relatively recent times was thought of as a 
joke 
after all in the old scotch prayer book a littany read at the 
service said from ghoulies and ghosties and things that go 
bump in the night dear lord deliver us 
but whatever your beliefs of halloween may be you are not 
entitled to force them on me that is the reason why school prayer 
has been banned

thousands of people contend that radioactive emissions from 
the plant through the years have caused an unusual number of rare 
cancers miscarriages and other health problems 
this new search is a continuation of the saga of a federal 
government that for nearly a halfcentury has operated its nuclear 
weapons plants with reckless disregard for the safety of its workers 
and the safety of people living in the region 
neighbors of nuclearweapons plants should be told fully of

portland maine press herald on banning plastic firearms 
no one is manufacturing allplastic firearms yet but the 
technology is available and its only a matter of time 
given that prospect congress acted prudently last week in 
approving a ban on firearms capable of evading detection by metal 
detectors or xray machines 
the measure is a necessity it bans the manufacture importation 
sale shipment or possession of any firearm containing less than 37 
ounces of stainless steel exclusive of parts and magazines 
without this sort of legislation it would be possible for 
terrorists and other criminals to smuggle concealed weapons through 
detection devices at airports or courtrooms 
with it the job of law enforcement officials is enhanced 
the measure is a sensible one far better to confront the problem 
now before undetectable plastic firearms are on the market and on 
the street

los angeles times on the presidential campaign 
if the opinion polls are right neither george bush nor michael 
s dukakis has come remotely close to inspiring any appreciable 
number of his fellow citizens 
some of that is due to the two relatively colorless 
personalities a lot more has to do with the deplorable and even 
contemptible quality of their campaigns 
this has been without doubt the nastiest and most cynical contest 
for the white house in recent memory and worse the most devoid 
of substance 
the cynicism behind these negative strategies derives from the 
obvious calculation that voters will be swayed by misrepresentations 
and lies because they are too stupid or uncaring to know any better 
 
probably no campaign in the 20th century has done less to 
illuminate the likely decisions that the next president will be 
forced to make 
we dont know who the winner will be on nov 8 its clear 
already that the american people are the losers

from the belt of the american israel public affairs committee 
aipac it is that powerful 
the washingtonbased israeli lobby does not always get what it 
wants but it gets it frequently enough to prompt jeffrey record a 
senior research fellow at the hudson institute to remark that aipac 
knows no israeli act for which there is not an exculpatory 
explanation or mitigating excuse 
the prevailing view at the committees headquarters he said 
seems to be that all americans jews and gentiles alike should 
keep still and simply fork over whatever amount of military and 
economic assistance israel demands to express an opinion critical 
of how israel uses its virtually blank checks from the united states 
is to commit the unpardonable sin of meddling in the internal 
affairs of a sovereign state 
albeit slowly friends of israel who do not share aipacs myopic 
passion are waking to the fact that the lobby does not always speak

a media generalassociated press poll finds that while americans 
are wary of wall street they are optimistic about the economy and 
their personal finances 
a look at what has transpired since oct 19 1987 helps explain 
the upbeat mood 
the stock plunge of 508 points did not spark a recession as some 
had feared instead the countrys longest period of peacetime 
growth stretched into its 71st month 
this is a time when both consumers and producers can appreciate 
the resilience of the economy 
it is also a good time to remember that protectionist trade 
policies and tax increases were blamed for the great depression of 
the 1930s a mistake that must not be repeated

jackson had become a racially divisive personality whose further

congress itself sometimes is exempt from these laws 
a case in point is civil rights protection employers everywhere 
are prohibited from discriminating against their employees on 
grounds of race religion age or gender 
but not congress congressional employees have no such 
protection 
but cannot congress give its employees somewhat the same 
protection all other employees have short of bringing them under the 
civil rights acts yes and to its credit the house is now moving to 
do just that 
the house is creating a special office to handle complaints of 
this nature the arrangement calls for mediation and remedies with 
a separate panel designated to handle appeals from either side 
if handled properly this plan will provide adequate protection 
for house employees the senate unfortunately has shown no 
indication that it will follow the houses lead

unfair to sen dan quayle of indiana the republican vice

person to say it is sen edward m kennedy dmass 
the coverage has not been a fair characterization of him 
kennedy said in a speech at the associated press managing editors 
convention in boston last week 
most of his colleagues would say he does a lot better in 
giveandtake in the senate said kennedy ive worked with him 
and he does a better job on the senate floor 
kennedy said that in the 1988 presidential campaign the media and 
politics are dangerously intertwined a point with which few 
openminded people would disagree 
kennedy deserves high credit for doing what he can to set the 
record straight about sen quayle

another spot that his rival misled 62 million americans 
the new dukakis ads were scheduled to begin airing thursday in 
spot markets around the country said spokeswoman lorraine voles 
the new bush ad began airing wednesday night also in spot markets 
the bush spot the latest development in a series of titfortat 
distortion charges says the massachusetts governor deliberately 
misled 62 million americans when he denied during the televised 
oct 13 presidential debate that he raided his state pension system 
to balance the budget 
quoting the wall street journal as saying it is indisputable 
that dukakis shifted the money a narrator concludes and michael 
dukakis says george bush is running a campaign of lies michael 
dukakis is unbelievable 
dukakis and bush each are running a mix of positive and attack 
ads concentrated most heavily in pivotal states like california 
texas and ohio 
one of the new dukakis ads shows an elderly couple on a bench in 
an urban park a voiceover says imagine a place where people can 
grow old without being made to feel like a burden is that too much 
to expect as president michael dukakis would be on your side to 
those who would cut social security hell say never and hell back 
full costofliving adjustments 
another shows children on a playground and says imagine a 
place where children come out to play without fear of drugs or drug 
dealers is that too much to expect as president michael dukakis 
will be on your side hell declare a real war on drugs double the 
number of drug agents and slash aid to countries that allow drug 
traffic 
the other two spots talk about stretching two paychecks for the 
life one paycheck used to bring and vow to take on the toughest 
foreign competition and make america number one again all four

a judge has upheld the reelection of the 
selma mayor to a record seventh term ruling that a black former 
city councilman failed to provide any evidence the results were 
tainted 
montgomery county circuit judge joseph phelps also ordered 
challenger cleophus mann to pay all court costs phelps heard the 
case in dallas county where selma is located after two dallas 
county judges removed themselves from the case 
mann failed by 433 votes to force a runoff from the aug 23 
election with incumbent mayor joe smitherman mann challenged the 
results saying polling places had been moved improperly and voters 
were intimidated but phelps ruled tuesday that the suit had no 
basis 
the plaintiff mann testified he had no evidence that illegal 
votes had been cast in the aug 23 election and did not offer any 
evidence regarding the casting of illegal votes at trial said 
phelps 
i dont want to beat a dead dog but there never was a case to 
start with smitherman said he had his day in court and the 
judges order speaks for itself 
mann refused to comment on the decision 
phelps said manns claim seemed to focus on allegations that the 
city failed to obtain approval from the us justice department 
before moving several polling places as required under the 1965 
voting rights act 
but the judge noted that mann voted for the changes when he 
served on the city council and said that the moves were for the 
convenience of voters not for discriminatory purposes 
during an oct 17 hearing mann testified that voters were 
intimidated and pointed to the presence of selma police chief me 
summerlin at the polls wearing his weapon 
but in his ruling phelps said he found no act of intimidation 
or other acts of misconduct calculated to prevent the exercise of 
the right to vote 
smitherman was elected to his first term as mayor of the western 
alabama city shortly before it drew national attention as a 
battleground of the civil rights movement

plutonium particles floating in the air 
inside a key nuclear weapons facility contaminated two employees and 
a department of energy inspector on sept 29 a federal official 
said 
earl whiteman who supervises a 60person energy department 
office at rocky flats gave the report tuesday night before 300 
workers plant critics and others as he explained the incidents of 
the past few weeks 
but most of the audience said they left dissatisfied with 
whitemans answers about contamination 
we may sometimes not be good at explaining everything 
whiteman told the sometimes hostile crowd but we damn well tell 
the truth 
the response was boos and catcalls from half the audience 
whiteman focused on the sept 29 incident that led to the closing 
of building 771 the main production facility at the nuclear weapons 
plant the three people inhaled plutonium in their noses 
the shutdown of the plant and reports of problems at other 
facilities in ohio south carolina and elsewhere have prompted a 
national debate on the safety of nuclear defense plants 
whiteman said the three people walked into room 114 without 
wearing required respirators didnt see a warning sign and so 
walked near a bin storing plutonium waste 
but then he said the bin never released plutonium in the air 
which prompted confusion about why the trio was exposed to plutonium 
his answer was that its not uncommon for rocky flats to operate 
at 1 percent of the maximum allowable airborne radiation limit 
audience members said they couldnt understand why the building 
was shut down if the exposure to plutonium was so minor a tiny 
fraction of what the average coloradan is exposed to daily simply by 
living here 
officials are cleaning up the airborne radioactivity while the 
building is closed whiteman said the building is expected to 
reopen in a few weeks 
we want to control it so once the building is clean it will 
stay clean he said

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany said today 
the soviets have agreed to release all people regarded in the west 
as political prisoners within the next 10 weeks 
such a move would be one of the most dramatic signs yet from 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that he seeks a definitive 
break with past soviet human rights practices which have included 
the confinement of people who disagree publicly with kremlin policy 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov refused to 
confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners was in the 
offing 
gerasimov said the number of political prisoners in the country 
was about two dozen however political rights groups say there are 
about 200 political prisoners in the soviet union 
the white house said it was seeking further details and a leader 
of a group seeking emigration of soviet jews said he was 
skeptical of the reported promise 
gerasimov told a news briefing the issue of political prisoners 
was not on the agenda of sovietwest german negotiations that 
brought kohl to moscow kohl held 10 hours of talks with gorbachev 
and other top soviet officials 
at a news conference kohl told reporters that during the talks 
the soviets confirmed that they will release before the end of the 
year all political prisoners as we understand it in the west 
when asked how many people that could involve foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher of west germany replied we are not in a 
position to give final figures 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group said 
last month the number of people imprisoned in soviet labor camps 
psychiatric hospitals or exiled for their political beliefs numbered 
about 200 compared to 10000 a few years ago 
in january soviet human rights activist andrei d sakharov gave 
gorbachev a list of 200 soviets he said were imprisoned because of 
their political or religious views 
many western governments have given lists to the soviets of 
people they regard as jailed or held in psychiatric institutions for 
their political or religious beliefs 
in washington deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk 
said we have seen the news reports we are awaiting further 
details if true it is something we would look forward to 
in new york the chairman of the national conference on soviet 
jewry morris abram said he was skeptical of the reported soviet 
promise 
one will have to wait to see whether or not the promise is 
confirmed by the practice abram told the associated press 
i am skeptical because weve heard for a long time that the 
soviets are going to obey the obligation to let everyone leave the 
country who wishes to leave and thats just not happened he said 
when asked if the pledge had come from gorbachev himself kohl 
said only it was made during the talks 
last year soviet authorities released at least 300 prisoners who 
were being held on charges such as antisoviet agitation and 
propaganda or slandering the soviet state most estonian and 
lithuanian nationalists who were being imprisoned for their views 
have been released this year 
the ruling communist party and government are reviewing the 
soviet penal code and the united states has repeatedly urged that 
the soviets abolish those laws most often used to hold political 
dissenters 
soviet officials contend the law under which they were charged 
forbidding dissemination of antisoviet propaganda or agitation is 
being softened in the revision of the soviet criminal code

a federal judge today dismissed the jury in the 
perjury trial of rep pat swindall because of fliers that the 
congressman had mailed out making it unlikely swindall could be 
tried before election day 
us district judge robert vining said he believed swindall 
violated court rules by sending out campaign mass mailings that 
reached residents who were potential jurors in the case both last 
week and this week 
vining said he was not inclined to use the only other avenue 
through which swindall could be tried before the election a 
nonjury trial with vining determining the verdict 
but vining left the door open to such a possibility telling 
swindall i will call you in the morning and let you know if ive 
changed my mind he said he was unlikely to do so but added 
judges are wont to change their minds no date was immediately 
set for the selection of a new jury if the judge does not change 
his mind about a nonjury trial 
swindall 38 was indicted oct 17 on 10 perjury counts the 
charges cited his statements to a grand jury about his dealings with 
a an undercover internal revenue service agent posing as a money 
broker and atlanta businessman charles lechasney who already has 
pleaded guilty to money laundering charges that do not involve 
swindall 
vining had copies of two mass mailings one of which was dated 
after the time that he ordered swindall to obey local court rules on 
his comments outside the courtroom 
copies of the mailings were not immediately available but 
swindall said one was headlined why did congrssman pat swindall 
ask to be indicted 
prosecutor craig gillen said swindall should not be allowed to 
keep up such mailings under the guise of running a political 
campaign 
if mr swindall prefers to run for office he cant have his 
cake and eat it too gillen said if he wants to send these 
mailings out lets have the trial in december or november and have 
it in an orderly fashion 
pounding the rostrum as he addressed vining swindall said i 
find it absolutely incredible that the government tells me and the 
voters of the 4th district that i have to make a choice between 
running for reelection and coming down here and having this trial 
vining had warned both sides prior to the trial that if they said 
anything outside the courtroom that would affect the trial he would 
take action 
he did not place any specific subject areas off limits but he 
seemed particularly upset that one of the mailings had referred to 
swindalls claim that he had passed a polygraph test 
after vining dismissed the jury swindall said he was deeply 
disappointed by the turn of events today he said vinings comment 
that he could change his mind was a ray of hope 
us attorney robert barr declined to comment on vinings ruling 
opening arguments by swindall a lawyer who is representing 
himself and gillen had been set for today a jury had been seated 
tuesday 
swindall was so anxious about the trials pace tuesday morning 
that he suggested giving up his right to a jury but vining quickly 
rejected that idea 
polls show the twoterm republican congressman from suburban 
atlanta faces a tough reelection bid against democrat ben jones in 
the nov 8 election 
in his appearance before a grand jury in february swindall who 
was looking for an 850000 home mortgage said he did not recall 
being told the money brokers backers might be laundering illegal 
drug proceeds the government which secretly recorded several 
meetings charges swindall lied in his account 
swindalls questioning of prospective jurors revealed that he may 
call former presidential candidate rep jack kemp rny to the 
witness stand 
swindall asked two former new york residents who were on the 
panel of prospective jurors if they knew kemp who ran 
unsuccessfully for the gop presidential nomination this year 
neither of the two was chosen as a juror 
swindall later said he is considering calling kemp to testify he 
said he will decide later based on how the government presents its 
case 
swindall who was a cochairman of kemps presidential campaign 
in georgia said last week he might call some members of congress 
and administration officials as character witnesses

fewer than half of 1 percent of health care workers 
mistakenly exposed to aidstainted blood through cuts needle wounds 
or other accidents become infected with the lethal virus a new 
survey shows 
the review conducted at 335 hospitals across the united states 
concludes that the risk of hiv infection after exposure to the 
blood of a patient infected with hiv is low 
the risk of catching aids from patients is a serious concern in 
many hospitals the latest research confirms earlier studies showing 
that while this threat is slight onthejob infection can happen 
the researchers followed 1201 nurses and other hospital workers 
who came into contact with the blood of people infected with hiv 
the aids virus a report on the work directed by ruthanne marcus of 
the centers for disease control in atlanta was published in this 
weeks new england journal of medicine 
results of aids testing were available for 963 of the health care 
workers and four of them or 042 percent were infected as a 
result of needle sticks 
two of the four cases occurred when people were accidentally 
stuck with needles by fellow workers during emergency resuscitation 
procedures 
among the reports findings 
sixtythree percent of the potential aids exposures occurred in 
nurses 14 percent in doctors and medical students 11 percent in 
lab technicians 7 percent in people drawing blood 3 percent in 
respiratory therapists and 2 percent in housekeeping and maintenance 
workers 
eight percent of the exposures resulted from needle sticks the 
rest were cuts with sharp objects open wound contamination and 
exposure to mucous membranes 
thirtyseven percent of the exposures could have been prevented 
if routine precautions had been followed 
the researchers said their work underscores the need to handle 
sharp instruments carefully in all circumstances even during 
emergencies 
in a separate report in the journal researchers reported on the 
high rate of aids infection at a hospital in kinshasa zaire they 
said there was no evidence that the health care workers had gotten 
their infections on the job because the infection rate was the same 
among those with heavy contact with patients and those who rarely 
saw patients 
the research conducted by dr bosenge ngaly and colleagues from 
project sida was based on aids infection tests given to 2002 
workers at mama yemo hospital

michael dukakis declared today the pollsters are 
not going to call the election and heard hispanic leaders say that 
a heavy voter turnout by their constituents could deliver a 
democratic upset on election day 
the democratic presidential nominee had breakfast with hispanic 
leaders in denver the morning after he said during in a 90minute 
interview on abctvs nightline that he was making real 
progess against republican rival george bush most national polls 
suggest otherwise 
the pollsters are not going to call the election dukakis 
told reporters in a statement its people who are going to be 
voting 
dukakis claimed overwhelming support among hispanics which he 
said stemmed from his longstanding commitment to minority issues 
especially the war against drugs 
they want a president who doesnt talk about the subject but 
who has done something about it the massachusetts governor said 
the hispanic leaders praised dukakis for his commitment to civil 
and voting rights affirmative action urban renewal and economic 
development 
they said hispanics are grossly underrepresented in presidential 
polls and that a 70 percent turnout among them could swing a close 
election in dukakis favor 
rep albert bustamante of texas saluted dukakis as both a 
technocrat and the liberal of 1988 he said this meant 
dukakis cared children the elderly health care and the environment 
when bustamante used the word technocrat dukakis grinned and 
chimed in 15 percent the candidate did not take questions from 
reporters 
during his tv interview with ted koppel dukakis said conceded he 
was partly to blame for not answering early gop campaign attacks on 
his record 
but he claimed he was gaining on the vice president despite new 
polls showing he was trailing bush by doubledigit margins 
i feel good about things he said in the nationally televised 
interview i think were making some real progress 
after the program dukakis told reporters he thought the interview 
was great terrific 
dukakis was campaigning in colorado and illinois today and 
planned to keep a high television profile in the remaining days of 
the campaign including an interview with cbs on thursday and nbc on 
friday 
dukakis was questioned on a broad range of issues during the 
nightline appearance giving the reagan administration some 
credit for winning arms control agreements with the soviet union 
while denouncing the administration and specifically bush for 
failing in the war on drugs 
im willing to get much much tougher than this 
administration in the drug fight he said but he reiterated his 
opposition to capital punishment regardless of the offense 
it was not until well into the interview that dukakis raised the 
issue he has been focusing on in his speeches in recent days bushs 
support of a capital gains tax credit that dukakis characterizes as 
a boon for the rich including the vice president himself that will 
result in an added burden on average americans 
koppel after referring to the latest polls asked dukakis what 
bush had done to nail your hide to the wall thus far 
dukakis did not dispute the characterization before blaming his 
position in the polls on a relentlessly negative gop campaign and 
his failure to counterattack 
the bush campaign made a very careful and deliberate decision 
way back in the spring to run a tough attacking negative campaign 
and theyve been doing it ever since and perhaps i responded too 
late perhaps i should have been out there attacking or 
counterattacking from the beginning dukakis said 
they questioned my patriotism they questioned my wifes 
patriotism they questioned my health and that kind of thing has 
made this a tough and difficult campaign 
he accused bush of ducking the issues by running a campaign 
loaded with distortion ad misrepresentation and falsehoods 
two polls released tuesday night reported bush held a 
doubledigit lead in the presidential race with only two weeks to 
election day 
a cbs newsnew york times survey of 1287 probable voters showed 
bush leading dukakis 5441 percent while a gallup poll of 815 likely 
voters showed bush up by 14 points 533 percent 
the cbstimes poll was conducted friday through monday and had a 
margin of error of three points the gallup survey was done friday 
through sunday and had a fourpoint error margin 
dukakis said his own instincts indicated voters were turning 
against the republican campaign tactics however asked about the 
polls after the television interview he said simply forging 
ahead 
dukakis came to colorado after spending tuesday morning 
campaigning in california where he took issue with a republican 
campaign commercial ridiculing him for riding in an army tank 
we democrats are for a strong defense he said thats 
nonsense he said of the ads assertion that he has opposed 
virtually all new proposed weapons systems

the guidelines said a pregnant women who has had an earlier child 
by caesarean section should be encouraged to attempt labor in her 
current pregnancy instead of routinely undergoing a second 
surgical delivery 
this is the first time in over 70 years we are saying that a 
patient who has had a csection should not have a repeat csection 
unless there is a definite medical need she said at a news 
conference 
the significant shift of emphasis stems from a gradual increase 
of statistical data that shows mothers and babies generally fare 
better with vaginal delivery even if the mother has previously had 
a low transverse incision csection she said 
as with any surgical procedure csections are more costly than 
natural delivery and raise the prospect of the same type of 
potential complications always attendant surgery such as infections 
and reactions to anthesia 
dr osullivan said if the new guidelines are accepted by us 
hospitals they will go a long way toward ending the once a 
csection always a csection tradition that has guided obstetric 
practice since 1916 
the acog committee found that women who have had a csection by 
the lowtransverse method were successful in subsequent vaginal 
delivery attempts in most cases 
up to 70 percent of these women who had their first caesarean 
birth because of failure to progress in a long and difficult labor 
were able to deliver vaginally with their second child dr 
osullivan said 
since 1982 the acog has urged physicians to encourage women to 
attempt vaginal deliveries even after prior csections the action 
was taken after a number of studies indicated that mortality rates 
for mother and child were lower among women who attempted labor than 
among those who chose repeated caesarean births 
until recent years it was believed that once a woman had had a 
csection all subsequent children had to be delivered the same way 
the number of csections routinely performed in recent years 
however has declined and the new guidelines are intended to 
encourage this trend 
in 1987 about 244 percent of all live births or 934000 of 38 
million were performed by csection about 35 percent of the 
surgical births were repeat csections 
the surgical procedure would continue to be used where medically 
indicated such as for some breech births when there are signs that 
the baby is in distress or following a difficult and prolonged 
attempt at labor 
the acog announcement said csections will continue to be used 
for women who have had a previous classical caesarean in this 
procedure the uterus is incised vertically a technique now rarely 
used about 99 percent of all csections now use a transverse 
incision which goes from one side to the other instead of up and 
down

nato defense ministers begin a series of 
talks thursday that will focus on whether the alliance needs more 
powerful nuclear weapons for frontline combat 
since the united states and the soviet union signed a treaty in 
december to eliminate mediumrange nuclear weapons much attention 
has shifted to upgrading shortrange nuclear artillery and missiles 
the talks of the brusselsbased north atlantic treaty 
organization which begin at the hague netherlands will focus on 
whether the western alliance should modernize these forces 
a dutch defense specialist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
told reporters in the hague that the talks will make an inventory 
of our options the source said the discussions would provide gen 
john galvin commander of nato forces in europe with guidelines for 
making a decision in 1989 or 1990 
most nato nations want to extend the range of the shortrange 
tactical weapons to make up for the loss of weapons under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty that pact eliminated all 
us and soviet landbased missiles with ranges from 300 to 3000 
miles 
the range of a new generation of weapons would likely be extended 
up to the treaty limits of about 300 miles analysts say 
a key candidate for upgrading is the lance surfacetosurface 
missile which was introduced in 1972 and which military analysts 
say will be obsolete by 1995 the lance has a range of just over 62 
miles but a new system might boost that above 248 miles 
the united states and united kingdom have indicated support for 
modernizing the shortrange weapons but germany and the 
netherlands which have strong antinuclear movements have argued 
that such a decision is not yet needed 
the defense ministers meeting as natos nuclear planning group 
gather twice a year 
fourteen of natos 16 members will take part in the talks 
iceland attends only as an observer and france operates outside 
natos common military planning us defense secretary frank 
carlucci will represent the united states

food fights are a faux pas at the elegant tables 
of tiffanys where moppets sip instead of slurp from the finest 
crystal and china 
at first they have looks on their faces like my mother made 
me do this said annie cater who runs table manners classes for 
tiffany amp co in seven cities but by the time the class is over 
the little boys are seating everybody at the graduation party and 
the kids are toasting one another 
in the past two years ms cater has helped polish the table 
manners of more than 900 children and adults including executives 
concerned about which fork to use at important business lunches it 
all started with the kids 
a friend said i want you to teach my brownie class some 
etiquette so i got the tiffanys etiquette book the silver 
crystal and china i had 28 8yearolds in my face i almost died 
she recalled 
she succeeded though and went on to convince tiffanys that it 
could market the concept now there are 109 kids ages 8 to 16 on 
the waiting list in houston and classes are springing up in 
atlanta boston chicago dallas san francisco and costa mesa 
calif 
they learn not to shout across the table to pass the salt over 
their arm things theyll remember said ms cater i think 
its successful because im not their mother theres no peer 
pressure i make it very comfortable for them 
its just such fun children are fascinating she added 
and unpredictable 
i was on live tv with a little boy i said jason tell 
everybody what this is 
he said its a finger bowl 
i said do you have those at home 
he said yes my father drinks margaritas out of those 
most kids first guess the bowl holds lemonade or soup but soon 
theyre dunking their pinkies like pros 
we do use tiffany china crystal and silver said ms cater 
weve had a couple of things spilled but nothing broken i think 
they know when they come in here that its special and precious 
once they hold it theyre going to like it 
after learning the basics in a class of 12 during two hourlong 
sessions at the store the students dress up for a graduation meal 
at a hotel 
afterward ms cater often gets thankyou notes one boy wrote 
now i can eat with the kings 
what makes me feel so good about it is they go home and they 
use the things theyve learned even if theyre going to mcdonalds 
that night they remember that their bread and butter plate is on 
the left and their glass on the right 
adults are flocking to the classes too learning the rudiments 
of napkinfolding and olivenibbling at mock dinners and cocktail 
parties 
if youre out in the business world and dont have good table 
manners youll be in trouble said ms cater if you know what 
fork youre going to use then you can listen to the business 
conversation enjoy the food and whats going on around you 
the lesson price differs depending on the city in houston its 
65 for children and 100 for adults

prime minister margaret thatcher already the 
wests longestserving leader after nearly a decade in power says 
she will seek an unprecedented fourth term a newspaper reported 
wednesday 
the 63yearold conservative chief of state said she planned to 
lead her party into the next election and remain prime minister for 
another fiveyear term if it wins according to an interview in the 
times of london the election must be held by 1992 
the conservatives named mrs thatcher prime minister in may 1979 
after they defeated a labor party government she has championed 
individual initiative and handsoff government as an ideological 
partner of president reagan 
some time there will come along a person who can do it better 
than i can she was quoted as saying and im always on the 
lookout but i expect myself to do it for the fourth term 
asked if she had a date in mind to retire she was quoted as 
saying no but obviously one isnt indestructible 
in the same interview mrs thatcher defended her governments 
weekold ban on interviews by domestic broadasters with members of 
the irish republican army she said she may even extend the order to 
foreignbased networks 
to beat off your enemy in a war you have to suspend some of 
your civil liberties for a time 
the new rules prohibit domestic broadcasters from interviewing 
members of the outlawed ira and 10 other militant groups in northern 
ireland 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the 60 percent protestant province with 
the 95 percent catholic irish republic 
asked about possible ira interviews with foreignbased satellite 
television stations due to broadcast in britain next year mrs 
thatcher said the only thing we could do here is to make it an 
offense to beam such stuff into this country if need be 
opposition and civil rights groups have said the ban fails as an 
antiterrorist weapon and interferes with freedom of the press 
the government also announced last week it would abolish the 
right of all criminal suspects in northern ireland england and 
wales to remain silent during police interrogation

two soviet icebreakers flying 
us and soviet flags worked today to smash through an ice ridge as 
dawn approached on what rescuers hope will be freedom day for two 
whales imprisoned in ice for nearly three weeks 
the whales seemed to be doing fine rear adm sigmund 
petersen of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said 
this morning its like they expected something to be happening 
everything seems to be coming together 
rescuers had one of their best days yet tuesday as the 
unprecedented international effort to save the two california gray 
whales neared a climax they succeeded in moving the huge mammals 
around a shoal that had stymied progress for three days 
as darkness fell tuesday the mammals were only about two miles 
from the water being opened by the soviet ships 
the whales could be free by late this afternoon if things go as 
well today as they did the day before said noaa rescue coordinator 
ron morris 
we feel very good about it petersen said this morning the 
cooperation has just been fantastic the soviets came in here with a 
very positive attitude and went to work immediately 
later today rescuers planned to use a tractorlike device 
propelled by pontoon augers to cut the relatively thin ice remaining 
between the whales and the icebreakers farthest advance 
we certainly hope it will end today petersen said we are 
just hoping that things are just coming together 
in another development tuesday the federal aviation 
admininistration ordered flights around barrow point to stay above 
2000 feet because of crowding by small planes taking a look at the 
whales the washington post said 
around noon tuesday morris petersen and capt jim mcclelland of 
the us coast guard flew to the icebreaker admiral makarov as it 
waited about 25 miles northeast of barrow 
after a perfunctory briefing the icebreakers skipper said he 
was ready to begin work immediately 
we shall commence just now said sergei fedorovich reshetov 
in five minutes our engines will be ready 
the 440foot icebreaker an american flag flying above its 
frostencrusted superstructure quickly cruised through thin ice to 
the pressure ridge that is the last significant barrier to freedom 
in just a few hours the ship had battled almost threefourths of 
the way through the ridge a jumble of ice blocks as big as small 
houses 
with only about 100 yards to go the admiral makarov which draws 
about 40 feet of water nearly ran out of room mcclelland said he 
thought the ship nudged the seabed from time to time 
the plan was for the 496foot vladimir arseniev an icebreaking 
cargo ship which draws only about 20 feet to finish the job 
rescuers however did not think the smaller ship could go all the 
way to the whales 
the admiral makarov ran its bow up over the ice shuddering only 
slightly as its 20000 tons broke through thicknesses of 6 to 8 feet 
spidery cracks raced in all directions outward from the ship as 
it battered its way through ice blanketed with snow bearing the 
tracks of polar bears 
the vessel repeated the maneuver again and again leaving 
millions of dirty ice cubes as rubble 
its a magnificent ship petersen said as he watched the 
icebreaker work 
with the wind going as it is it couldnt be better 
mcclelland said 
rescuers counted on a steady east wind and prevailing currents to 
carry debris left by the icebreakers out of the whales path 
meanwhile chain sawwielding eskimos cut a detour for the whales 
to swim around shallow water through which the animals had refused 
to pass 
by cutting breathing holes in deeper water away from the shoal 
the eskimos were able to lure the whales about two miles from the 
place where they were found a third whale disappeared friday and is 
believed dead 
the icebreakers had been returning to their home port of 
vladivostok when they were diverted said alexander patzevich chief 
officer and second in command the vessels dropped off personnel and 
1000 tons of equipment to establish a floating polar research 
station last week 
although the admiral makarov has been at sea for six months and 
everybody is tired none of the crew of 78 has complained about 
the diversion patzevich said 
its very nice to work together he said of the ussoviet 
effort 
the north slope borough helicopter that flew whalerescue team 
members to the icebreaker took reshetov and several crew members to 
see the whales 
first mate vladimir moroz who said he was the ships political 
officer said the soviets were happy to help 
he said he spoke to a moscow newspaper by telephone on monday 
theyre receiving many many calls asking about the whales 
moroz said our country is watching like everyone else we love 
animals just as everyone 
moroz said another soviet icebreaker helped free a pod of beluga 
whales trapped in bering sea ice across from alaska three years ago 
the admiral makarov bore a goldcolored hammer and sickle on its 
smokestack and a soviet flag flew from the stern mcclelland said 
the captains decision to fly a us flag was a common courtesy 
normally a merchant ship will fly the flag of the country its 
working in he said 
small airplanes crowding the skies over the whales prompted the 
faa restriction 
to have these airplanes swarming around like little bees over 
the rescue operations turns into a nightmare on the ground paul 
steucke an faa spokesman in anchorage told the post in 
addition its one heck of a hazard in the sky the opportunity to 
hit each other is quite high 
normally there are two commercial flights in and out of barrow 
each day

as his underdog campaign draws to a close 
democratic nominee michael dukakis is leaning on his partys 
traditional populist themes that put harry truman over the top in 
1948 and shifted millions of votes to hubert humphrey in 1968 
the massachusetts governor has touted his competence hes 
boasted about his good judgment in selecting lloyd bentsen as his 
vice presidential running mate hes attacked ethical lapses in the 
reagan administration and hes derided republican rival george bush 
as the artificial creation of cynical handlers 
but with his growing deficit in the polls and the increasing 
impatience of his supporters dukakis is finally homing in on a 
classoriented easy street vs main street message that has served 
democrats well in the past 
the real question is will we have a president who fights for 
the privileged few or will we have a president who fights for 
you he asks in a late october campaign advertisement typical of 
his new approach 
george bush wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of the 
people in this country a new tax break worth 30000 a year he 
says im fighting for you and your family for affordable housing 
and health care for better jobs for the best education and 
opportunity for our children 
democratic consultants with long memories can hardly conceal 
their elation they say theyve been urging dukakis to take this 
tack for months 
theres now been a shift to distinguishing what really makes 
the democrats distinctive and different we care about the average 
person we believe government can have a constructive role in 
helping the average person says stuart eizenstat an unofficial 
adviser to the dukakis campaign who formerly worked for humphrey and 
president carter 
its very important for a democratic candidate to remind people 
who does what for them says adviser robert hunter a foreign 
affairs specialist and a former humphrey speechwriter 
the governor is catching up with the kind of strategy that can 
work for him and lets hope better late than never pays off 
hunter said 
twenty years ago with humphrey lagging 15 points behind richard 
nixon three weeks before the 1968 election pollster vic fingerhut 
wrote a memo that resonates eerily in 1988 
fingerhuts advice to the humphrey campaign concentrate on 
voters likely to cross party lines george wallace and nixon 
democrats in 1968 reagan democrats in 1988 reach them with short 
tv ads stress economic themes raise the specters of education and 
social spending cutbacks and hammer home the idea that humphrey is 
a tough fighter for the common man 
the memo cited findings that truman won late votes because of 
economic concerns not because he was a feisty underdog people 
came to vote for truman faster than they came to like him 
fingerhut wrote 
his conclusion forget about trying to make humphrey likable and 
go back to democratic roots 
according to fingerhut 8 million votes shifted to the vice 
president in the final three weeks before the 1968 election most of 
them bluecollar and middleclass voters with socially conservative 
attitudes the same kinds of people dukakis needs to attract 
fingerhut attributes 7 million of those votes to economic 
concerns others such as eizenstat say part of the late rally was 
promoted by humphreys declaration of independence from president 
johnson on the vietnam war but they say economic issues were at 
least equally important 
the dukakis camp their candidate more comfortable as a 
cleangovernment crusader than a class warrior auditioned other 
messages for weeks 
they tried real hard to reinvent the wheel and when they ended 
up it wasnt even round said dan payne a boston advertising 
executive who did primary spots for dukakis 
now in his speeches and commercials dukakis talks of day care 
family leave education jobs trade home ownership health care 
and the struggles of twoearner families to keep up 
hes on their side he says of bush and the wealthy im on 
your side 
will wavering democrats and independents respond to this late 
populist appeal 
eizenstat said those issues proved potent for humphrey in the 
face of a nixon assault that included the same charges of weak on 
defense and soft on crime that bush is using against dukakis 
now that people are really focused on the 1988 campaign they 
will respond to the very same breadandbutter issues eizenstat 
said 
dukakis has a few problems that humphrey didnt have the 
democratic majority of registered voters is smaller than it was in 
1968 and party ties are weaker humphrey was part of a democratic 
administration while dukakis is a nonwashington candidate who must 
convince voters that the white house needs a change of party 
humphrey was further behind than dukakis in the final stretch of 
the campaign though his momentum by election day led many to 
believe that humphrey could have beaten nixon in a few more days 
the humphrey and truman models should be the dukakis model 
says fingerhut if he follows those models he can win the 
election

a committee of educators students and 
religious leaders has begun compiling a list of values to be taught 
in new jersey schools starting with honesty compassion courage 
and hard work 
the difficulty will be figuring out what else there is said 
gov thomas h kean who ordered the group to come up with its 
recommendations by march 
kean announced his valueseducation campaign earlier this year 
the committee began its work tuesday 
were all aware of the fact this effort is going to be complex 
and is a little controversial said richard herold a lawyer and 
chairman of the 20member panel 
new jersey joins other states including maryland california and 
new york working to bring values into public education despite 
wariness that it could violate constitutional principles of 
separation of church and state 
the trend has been applauded by conservative groups as well as 
the civil liberties organization people for the american way which 
endorses values education as long as tolerance is one of the lessons 
stressed 
there has been a growing consensus that students arent born 
knowing the difference between right and wrong any more than theyre 
born with the knowledge of calculus said david crane education 
issues director for people for the american way based in 
washington dc 
kean a republican lamented such disgraced national figures as 
former white house aide michael deaver and wall street giant ivan 
boesky 
good citizenship kean said is as important to teach as english 
and chemistry 
what teachers tell me and counselors tell me again and again is 
there doesnt seem to be anything these youth can put their faith 
in kean said adding that amoral young people are easy marks 
for drug dealers 
values would not be taught in a single class but would be laced 
through the curriculum from elementary grades to high school 
education commissioner saul cooperman said 
he suggested young students could be taught the sacredness of 
promises for example while older students could learn about the 
importance of crediting sources in english papers 
details such as whether students would be graded on the values 
they learn have yet to be determined 
teachers and administrators would have to teach by example 
cooperman said 
we cant say do as i say but dont do as i do he said 
kids see through that in five seconds 
the panel chosen by cooperman represents a wide range of 
geography and backgrounds and includes a rabbi baptist minister and 
catholic bishop the only thing the members have in common is their 
own good citizenship kean said 
a spokesman for a national youth advocacy group applauded new 
jerseys efforts but warned it would be a tricky wicket to 
produce a list that has both substance and universal acceptance 
i think its the kind of thing we need to weave into the 
educational experience said mike buscemi senior vice president 
of the organization quest international of granville ohio we 
have a lot of kids who are floundering and looking for direction

firstyear base wage increases excluding 
costofliving adjustments or colas averaged 33 percent in major 
union contracts negotiated in the first nine months of this year 
the government said wednesday 
including colas but not lumpsum bonuses now prevalent in 
manufacturing union workers under major contracts received 
effective pay increases averaging 35 percent over the past year 
the labor department said 
the average annual increase in the new contracts falls to 28 
percent over their usual twotothreeyear lives the bureau of 
labor statistics said indicating a return to socalled frontloaded 
contracts 
backloaded contracts in which the biggest increases came closer 
to the expiration of the accords than at their beginning had 
dominated labor relations from the 198182 recession until last 
year according to government figures 
eighty percent of the some 14 million workers covered in major 
contracts negotiated so far in 1988 received firstyear increases in 
their base pay the bureau said eighteen percent accepted wage 
freezes and 2 percent gave up pay concessions 
the bureau said 35 percent of those covered in contracts 
negotiated from january through september of this year received 
firstyear wage adjustments of between 2 percent and 4 percent 
twentyeight percent of the covered workers received base pay 
adjustments between 4 percent and 6 percent adjustments of less 
that 2 percent went to 14 percent of the covered workers in new 
contracts while 3 percent received firstyear adjustments greater 
than 6 percent of their base wage 
including those who agreed to wage freezes or concessions in the 
first year of newly negotiated contracts the average base wage 
increase in the first year of newly negotiated contracts was 25 
percent the government said 
the costofliving adjustments or colas designed to adjust wages 
to reflect changes in consumer prices were introduced or 
reestablished for about 11 percent or 161000 of the covered workers 
under settlements reached so far this year 
the government said virtually all of them are teamsters covered 
by the national master freight agreement negotiated last spring the 
new threeyear trucking industry contract reestablish a cola that 
had been suspended during the past accord 
as a result the government said the proportion of union workers 
covered by cola protections in their contracts has climbed from 38 
percent at the end of 1987 to 40 percent as of oct 1 in the 1970s 
more than half of all union workers had cola provisions in their 
contracts 
both colas and lumpsum bonuses continue to be more prevalent in 
manufacturing than service industries 
labor contracts with manufacturers now provide some 51 percent of 
the covered workers with lumpsum bonuses ranging from 200 up to 
10000 a year and 62 percent of the workers with cola 
for union workers in nonmanufacturing industries only 10 
percent get bonuses and 26 percent have cola protections the 
government said

convicted multiple killer john wayne 
gacy has complained to state republican officials about a campaign 
leaflet that said he would be eligible for weekend passes had he 
committed his crimes in massachusetts 
in a letter received monday at state republican headquarters 
gacy criticized the gop for exploiting the name of john wayne gacy 
in order to scare people into voting for george bush 
the letter said cant bush run on his own record and the 
truth instead of all this scarey sic fantasy 
gacy imprisoned at the menard correctional center in southern 
illinois confirmed today that he wrote the letter according to 
brian fairchild a spokesman for the state department of corrections 
a slightly different version of the letter was mailed to the 
associated press 
gacy was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 young men and boys 29 
of whom were found buried in his home in an unincorporated area near 
chicago he was sentenced to death and his case is under appeal 
the brochure gacy cites was distributed by the state republican 
party it was labeled garbage earlier this month by 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the democratic presidential 
candidate 
if john wayne gacy had committed his atrocious crimes in boston 
instead of chicago he would be eligible for weekend passes under 
michael dukakis furlough program the leaflet said 
some convicted killers were granted furloughs during dukakis 
administration and the bush campaign has made frequent reference to 
one of them willie horton who subsequently raped a woman in 
maryland the furlough program has since been changed to exclude 
firstdegree murderers 
stuart piper executive director of the state republican party 
said he was surprised by the letter 
we didnt know if the letter was from gacy and we didnt feel 
that it dignified any public response piper said apparently 
he felt differently and released it to the media himself

saying he was tired of being a mystery 
man the father of a 9yearold girl came forward today and 
disclosed that hes told his daughter of a pennsylvania couples 
claim to be her rightful parents 
the couple alleges the girl was born to them but was switched 
with an ailing child soon after birth at a florida hospital 
robert mays a 43yearold salesman held a news conference at 
his lawyers office and said he told his daughter kimberly michelle 
about the case last week 
mays who has remained silent while trying to protect his 
daughter said he was worried she might learn about the case from 
someone else 
i was tired of living a lie i saw no reason to keep it 
secret from her any longer he said 
mays name which has been known to the media had been 
voluntarily withheld in published reports to protect the child mays 
thanked reporters for their consideration 
i had hoped this scenario would go some other way mays said 
adding that he has no reason to believe that regina and ernest twigg 
of langhorne pa will stop pursuing their claim 
he said his daughter took the news of the monthslong legal 
battle very well 
shes an intelligent little girl welladjusted shes a 
totally loved child and well taken care of the childs mother 
died of cancer when she was 3 
the twiggs maintain that their daughter a healthy girl was 
deliberately switched in the nursery at hardee memorial hospital in 
wauchula shortly after birth and they were given a sickly child 
hospital workers then altered records to hide the swap they allege 
the girl they raised arlena died in august from a heart defect 
the twiggs say kimberly was born at hardee memorial in late 1978 at 
about the same time as arlena 
the twiggs say genetic tests this summer revealed arlena was not 
their biological daughter 
they filed a 100 million suit against the hospital and some of 
its employees and persuaded the fbi to investigate the fbi 
however failed to find sufficient evidence that federal laws had 
been violated 
the twiggs have asked a court for genetic testing to determine if 
kimberly has the same blood type as theirs 
mays said he was reluctant to submit kimberly to such a test 
because of mere speculation he said the twiggs have presented no 
evidence to show that kimberly could be their daughter 
when the whole situation began to unfold mays said he couldnt 
believe it 
i thought it was a terrible joke he said today it was 
like a fairy tale only recently ive been honest enough with 
myself to realize this isnt going to go away

michael dukakis insisted today he is making real progress and 
shrugged off a doubledigit deficit in new polls republican george 
bush said his proposed capital gains tax cut is not a tax break 
for the rich 
the pollsters are not going to call the election dukakis 
said in a statement to reporters in denver its people who are 
going to be voting 
dukakis met with hispanic leaders in tossup colorado before 
traveling to illinois 
in detroit bush defended his proposal to slash the capital gains 
tax on profits from stocks real estate and other assets from its 
current level of 28 percent down to 15 percent dukakis has 
denounced it as a tax break for the wealthy and said bush personally 
would reap a 22000 advantage a year 
it is not a tax break for the rich it is a break for those who 
want to have a job in this country and i am for it bush declared 
unfortunately my opponents only experience with business is 
regulating it and taxing it 
president reagan ventured into the democratic stronghold of 
maryland and noted the democrats complaints about the negative tone 
of the campaign 
well i think theyre squirming because george has shown 
america how far outside the mainstream they really are reagan 
said 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle in florida 
campaigning for senate candidate connie mack iii talked as though 
the election were over he noted the difficulty of a white house 
that has to deal with an oppositioncontrolled congress when 
youre in the minority the majority controls the gavel theyre 
able to set the agenda in congress quayle said 
with less than two weeks remaining until election day dukakis 
insisted in a latenight television interview tuesday that there was 
still time for him to overtake frontrunner bush 
but when asked shortly after the program about polls showing him 
trailing by 13 and 14 percentage points the democratic nominee 
simply replied forging ahead 
in the 90minute interview on abcs nightline questioner ted 
koppel asked dukakis what bush had done to nail your hide to the 
wall thus far the democratic nominee failed to challenge koppels 
assessment of the white house race before answering the question 
two things dukakis said the bush campaign made a very 
careful and deliberate decision way back in the spring to run a 
tough attacking negative campaign and theyve been doing it ever 
since and perhaps i responded too late perhaps i should have been 
out there attacking or counterattacking from the beginning 
he also criticized republican advertising and charged bush with 
running a campaign loaded with distortion and misrepresentation 
and falsehoods 
earlier tuesday bush defended his campaign ads against the 
dukakis attacks 
because he was trying to run away from his record i have 
factually pointed out where he stands on the record bush said 
during a campaign stop in akron ohio and i am not going to be 
deterred i am going to keep doing that honestly factually 
the vice president targeting a mustwin dukakis state told an 
audience in lima ohio that the election is a referendum on peace 
and prosperity and that dukakis is too inexperienced to be president 
we cannot gamble americas future on a president who hasnt had 
one single days experience in national defense matters or foreign 
affairs bush said 
polls released tuesday suggested that the democratic ticket faces 
a difficult task in its quest for the white house 
a cbs newsnew york times survey of 1287 probable voters showed 
bush leading dukakis 5441 percent while a gallup poll of 815 likely 
voters showed bush up by 14 points 5339 percent 
the cbstimes poll was conducted friday through monday and had a 
margin of error of three points the gallup survey was done friday 
through sunday and had a fourpoint error margin 
as part of their uphill fight the dukakis campaign released four 
new tv ads which ask voters to imagine a world where children can 
play without fear of drug dealers where the elderly are no longer a 
burden where a single paycheck pays the bills and where america is 
no 1 in competition on foreign markets 
all four ads end with the phrase dukakisbentsen the best 
america is yet to come 
the ads are scheduled to begin airing on thursday in spot markets 
around the country said dukakis spokeswoman lorraine voles 
the bush campaign also released an ad alleging that dukakis 
misled 62 million americans when he denied during the last 
presidential debate that he raided his state pension system to 
balance the budget 
the ads narrator concludes and michael dukakis says george 
bush is running a campaign of lies michael dukakis is 
unbelievable 
bush aides said they did not know where or when the commercials 
will air 
in addition to advertising the dukakis campaign is filling the 
airwaves with none other than dukakis and bentsen the democratic 
nominee will appear on the cbs evening news thursday for a 
14minute interview with dan rather and also appear on nbc with 
anchor tom brokaw for a series next week on the candidates 
positions 
bentsen is scheduled to appear on the cbs program tonight the 
dukakis campaign also had bought five minutes of time on the network 
sunday night for a spot the texas senator will likely tape today in 
los angeles 
bentsen kept up his attack tuesday on what he called gop 
distortions of the democratic record 
the kind of campaign these republicans are waging would tear 
the heart out of a democracy he told a rally in great falls mont

republican george bush today portrayed michael 
dukakis as the odd man out in opposing a reduction in capital gains 
taxes and said his democratic opponent is just itching to 
repeal income tax cuts enacted in president reagans first term 
fortified by new polls showing him with a doubledigit lead the 
vice president attacked dukakis at a luncheon sponsored by the 
detroit economic club and the womens economic club 
playing it safe bush stuck to timetested themes 
the gop nominee has proposed slashing the capital gains tax on 
profits from stocks real estate and other assets from its current 
top of 33 percent to 15 percent dukakis denounced it as a tax break 
for the wealthy and said it would give bush himself a 22000 tax 
break annually 
defending his plan as a way to spur investments and create jobs 
bush said over the years its been endorsed by everyone from 
john f kennedy to lloyd bentsen to my running mate dan quayle to 
ronald reagan and george bush bentsen is dukakis vice 
presidential running mate 
it is not a tax break for the rich it is a break for those who 
want to have a job in this country and i am for it bush said 
unfortunately my opponents only experience with business is 
regulating it and taxing it bush said hes never run a 
business hes never started a business hes never met a payroll 
he doesnt understand how when youre starting out you need people 
to join you in taking risks so he paints my proposal as an effort 
to help the rich 
wrong bush told his audience of 1600 people 
the vice president also said that since reagan took office in 
1981 the administration has cut personal income tax rates by an 
average 27 percent 
he said there has been an undeniable link between low taxes and 
economic growth 
bush said dukakis was asked during the democratic primary race if 
he would repeal the 1981 tax cuts he said dukakis shrugged his 
shoulders and called the tax cut one of the worse bills that 
congress every could have passed and a governmentmade 
disaster 
bush said those sound to me like the words of someone who is 
just itching to repeal one of the most successful economic policies 
in our history and i know why he has proposed mandated new 
spending both by government and by business that will cost 
billions and billions and billions 
he said that if elected on nov 8 he will tell congress that 
the american people in electing me voted against a tax 
increase and that instead spending increases should be limited to 
the inflation rate 
bush told a gop barbecue in lima ohio on monday that the 
election was about keeping the country strong economically and 
militarily 
we cannot gamble americas future on a president who hasnt had 
one single days experience in national defense matters or foreign 
affairs bush said winning cheers from the audience 
a handful of hecklers shouted noisily at him during his speech 
and bush said im glad theyre here 
he urged the audience to ask the protesters how high interest 
rates and inflation were during the last democratic administration 
and then supplied the answers 21 percent for the former and in 
double digits for the latter 
working his way toward the battleground state of california 
where he will campaign later this week bush planned stops today at 
rallies at a stockyard in sioux falls sd and at a high school in 
billings mont in the evening he was flying to tacoma wash to 
campaign there thursday morning 
whereas michigan offers the prospect of 20 electoral votes south 
dakota has only three and montana has only four however all three 
states are on dukakis blueprint for reaching the 270 needed to win 
the white house so bush is doing his best to keep them out of the 
democratic column 
his campaign was bouyed tuesday by news of two new polls 
indicating that bush has solidified his lead in the two weeks since 
the last presidential debate 
a cbs newsnew york times poll showed bush with a 13point 
advantage 5441 percent while a gallup poll showed bush with a

zambians voted wednesday in elections 
expected to reaffirm support for the nations founding father whose 
popularity remains high despite severe economic problems 
president kenneth kaunda who led the british colony to 
independence oct 24 1964 needed 51 percent of ballots cast to 
serve another five years of kenyas 7 million people 26 million 
are registered to vote 
also up for election were the 125 seats in the national assembly 
zambians had to decide from 609 candidates from the united national 
independence party 
voters chose between two symbols picking an eagle if they 
wanted to vote for kaunda or choosing a frog to vote against him 
this is to accommodate illiterate voters 
the last election was held in october 1983 when kaunda won his 
fifth fiveyear term 
most observers believed that despite pressures for economic 
reforms most voters would cast their ballot for kaunda 
i will go by what the people say said kaunda 64 after 
casting his ballot this is exactly what we fought for it is the 
meaning of independence 
he said the elections should inspire voteless people in south 
africa and in southwest africa or namibia which is ruled by south 
africa 
the congress of the united national independence party has 
routinely nominated kaunda the sole candidate since independence 
although it is free to choose more than one new elections are held 
if the sole candidate loses 
analysts expected a low turnout for the sixth postindependence 
elections but long lines had formed outside some polling stations 
in the capital lusaka before voting began at 6 am 
rural zambians went to the polls by bus bicycle tractor and on 
foot in some areas voters paddled canoes to the booths in the 
mpika district of central province where roads are impassable 
because of heavy rains voters were ferried by helicopters 
but zambian reporters in several rural areas said polling was 
slow and there were small lines outside most booths 
when kaunda led zambia to independence his people enjoyed one of 
the highest standards of living in africa thanks largely to high 
world prices for copper which earns 90 percent of export income 
but when prices slumped in the 1970s a time when landlocked 
zambia had transformed from food exporter to importer the nations 
fortunes changed the foreign debt mounted and today stands at 5 
billion 
most foreign donors have stopped helping zambia since kaunda last 
year abandoned an economic recovery program proposed by the 
international monetary fund

a new york prosecutor on wednesday urged west 
german ambassador jurgen ruhfus to help bring to justice a man who 
fled the united states while awaiting deportation as a suspected 
nazi war criminal 
brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman said she told the 
ambassador there was great concern in the united states that 
boleslav maikovskis would slip through the cracks of the west 
german judicial system 
maikovskis 83 left the united states last year after the us 
supreme court ruled him eligible for deportation for his alleged 
involvement in nazi atrocities during world war ii including the 
burning of a village in latvia and the shooting of women and 
children 
in 1965 the soviet union sentenced maikovskis to death in 
absentia he could have been deported to the soviet union in the 
wake of refusals in recent years by both switzerland and west 
germany to take him but former attorney general edwin meese refused 
to designate the soviet union as his destination 
holtzman said ruhfus told her authorities in west germany had 
only found out that maikovskis was living there several weeks ago 
when the matter was first made public in the us media 
the justice department has also said it was unaware maikovskis 
fled the country for west germany where he has sought political 
asylum 
holtzman said it was unclear to her whether local authorities in 
the town of dortmund knew of maikovskis presence and his suspected 
nazi past until the matter became public 
authorities in west germany earlier this month detained 
maikovskis and launched an investigation of his past in connection 
with the murder charges leveled against him by the soviets 
holtzman indicated she believed maikovskis had received some 
assurances from west german authorities that he would be safe in 
their country otherwise why would he go to a country that has 
refused in the past to accept his deportation from the united 
states she said 
west germany and switzerland both refused to accept maikovskis 
after the justice department initially ordered him deported in 1984 
meese refused to designate the soviet union as the country for 
maikovskis deportation even though the soviets had expressed great 
interest in bringing him to trial 
meese violated the law by failing to act on the courts 
determination that maikovskis should be deported from the united 
states holtzman said 
the german ambassador promised to keep holtzman informed of steps 
being taken against maikovskis and to convey to the bonn government 
the strong interest here that maikovskis not go unpunished 
holtzman said

a british television program claimed three french 
gangsters assassinated president john f kennedy on a contract from 
us organized crime but french records show two of them were not 
in dallas on nov 22 1963 
one of the three men sauveur pironti also denied the allegation 
in an interview published wednesday by the marseilles newspaper le 
provencal 
it quoted him as saying i was not in dallas but in the 
military in toulon and said he displayed a military service 
record showing he was based on a mine sweeper in toulon from oct 
16 1962 to april 16 1964 
i believe at that time my friend sarti was being held in 
baumettes prison in marseilles and roger bocagnani was in prison 
at fort du ha in bordeaux the newspaper quoted pironti as saying 
according to the twohour central television program the men 
who killed kennedy broadcast tuesday night lucien sarti was was 
shot to death in mexico in 1972 and bocagnani is believed to be 
working in the colombian cocaine trade 
french navy headquarters confirmed the dates of service in toulon 
and said pironti 46 could not have been in dallas on the day of 
the assassination the justice ministry said bocagnani was in a jail 
cell in marseille on that day 
kennedy was killed as he rode in a motorcade through dallas lee 
harvey oswald was charged with the shooting but jack ruby shot and 
killed him two days later the warren commission said oswald acted 
alone in the assassination 
there have been many theories over the years that oswald was not 
the killer or was part of a conspiracy in which assorted 
organizations governments and personalities were involved 
central television a company in britains commercial independent 
television network said its report was based on a fouryear inquiry 
by steve rivele an american writer and researcher and nigel 
turner the documentarys british director 
rivele said the three men were hired through organized crime 
circles on the french mediterranean island of corsica but the 
program produced no direct evidence of a corsican connection 
according to rivele he got on the corsican trail by interviewing 
christian david a french drug smuggler held at the leavenworth 
federal prison in kansas 
in exchange for help in hiring an attorney rivele said david 
told him he was offered the contract and refused it then gradually 
revealed the identities of those involved 
the american journalist said he persuaded a contact in the us 
drug enforcement agency not identified to give him someone who 
could corroborate davids story he identified that man as michel 
nicoli a government witness living under a false identity 
nicoli interviewed with his face obscured said he heard sarti 
bocagnoni and pironti were the killers in 1966 when he lived in 
buenos aires he said he believed it to be true but gave no 
indication that he had direct evidence of their involvement 
davids lawyer was interviewed and said the his client had given 
him a sealed envelope to be opened only if he was freed 
le provencal said pironti a corsican has lived in marseilles 
since his release four years ago after a prison term for drug 
smuggling 
it quoted him as saying he spoke for sarti and bocagnani and i 
can tell you that if they were in marseille they would be with me 
here tonight this business is the most incredible misadventure 
of my life

breaking with a 70yearold tradition the 
american college of obstetricians and gynecologists declared 
wednesday that women who have had a baby by caesarean section 
generally should deliver subsequent children by normal vaginal 
birth 
the new guidelines say such mothers should be encouraged by their 
doctors to choose normal delivery and that even those who have had 
two or more babies by csection should receive support for 
attempting a vaginal delivery if that is their choice 
the incidence of caesarean delivery has skyrocketed over the past 
two decades prompting many government and health leaders to pay 
closer attention to the risk and cost of such procedures balanced 
against natural delivery 
in 1987 for example 244 percent of the 38 million births 
recorded in the united states were by caesarean delivery compared 
with 55 percent of the 37 million births recorded in 1970 
of the 934000 caesarean deliveries in 1987 the college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists estimated that 35 percent were 
performed not because of a demonstrated medical need but merely 
because the mother had previously delivered by caesarean 
this is the first time in over 70 years we are saying that a 
patient who has had a csection should not have a repeat csection 
unless there is a defiite medical need said dr mary jo 
osullivan a member of the panel that developed the new guidelines 
she emphasized that the recommendation applies only to 
lowtransverse horizontal csections sometimes referred to by 
women as the bikini cut used 99 percent of the time 
for those 1 percent of mothers who have had the classical 
vertical incision the recommendation holds for using a csection in 
subsequent deliveries to miminize the risk of a rupture of the 
uterus along the scar from the previous incision 
if the new guidelines are embraced by us hospitals they will 
go far toward ending the once a csection always a csection 
tradition that has guided obstetric practice since 1916 said 
osullivan who is chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the 
university of miami medical school in florida 
she declined to offer a reason for the sharp rise in csections 
in recent years but she acknowledged that some doctors may 
encourage them because they can charge more than for normal 
delivery and also said many women do not want the pain of labor 
according to government statistics the average doctor and 
hospital charge in 1986 was 2620 for a normal delivery and 4330 
for a csection 
in an interview osullivan said she hopes that a woman who has 
undergone csections and meets guideline criteria for trying a 
vaginal delivery in subsequent births will consider switching 
physicians if her present one is not sympathetic to her desires 
on the other hand she said she hoped that physicians who 
subscribe to the guidelines would counsel their patients to switch 
to another doctor if they are determined from the earliest weeks of 
pregnancy to have a csection regardless of whether it is medically 
indicated 
the shift of position outlined wednesday stems from an 
accumulation of statistical data that has established that 
everything else being equal mother and baby generally fare better 
with vaginal delivery than a csection even if the mother has 
previously had a low transverse csection osullivan said 
not only are csections significantly more costly than natural 
delivery they raise the prospect of the same type of potential 
complications attendant any major surgery such as infections and 
reactions to anesthesia 
the study found that women who have had a csection by the 
lowtransverse method were successful in subsequent vaginal delivery 
attempts in most cases 
up to 70 percent of these women who had their first caesarean 
birth because of failure to progress in a long and difficult labor 
were able to deliver vaginally with their second child dr 
osullivan said 
csections would continue to be used for such complications as 
breech births when there are signs that the baby is in distress or 
following a difficult and prolonged attempt at labor

the defense department bracing for charges of 
censorship at the stars amp stripes military newspapers is debating a 
significant shift in structure that would put civilian journalists 
at the top of the masthead instead of military officers 
pentagon officials say no final decision has been made to ditch 
the existing organizational system but the officials say there 
appears to be fairly uniform agreement that something has to be 
done 
we dont want to fold these papers theres nothing out there 
to replace them explained one official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity so youve got to consider ways to 
strengthen editorial control and dampen charges of censorship 
the sources said wednesday they expected a decision on the future 
of the newspapers to be made soon perhaps within the next week 
because the pentagon is facing a deadline for responding to a draft 
study of the newspapers by the general accounting office 
that report by congress watchdog agency while still in 
preliminary form is described by officials who have read it as 
quite critical of the newspapers operation 
it finds overwhelming evidence of military censorship at one 
of the two papers the pacific edition of stars amp stripes one 
source said 
the best way to respond to the gao would be to tell them were 
already changing things around another source said 
the gao investigation was launched early this year at the behest 
of sen william proxmire dwis who persuaded congress to demand 
an inquiry into allegations of censorship by military commanders of 
the department of defense newspaper stars and stripes 
in demanding the investigation proxmire blasted the pentagon for 
sending soldiers overseas to protect freedom while denying them 
one of the most important freedoms that we have in this country 
that is the right to a free press under the first amendment 
although frequently referred to as one newspaper the stars and 
stripes is published in two separate editions by largely autonomous 
bureaus in west germany and japan designed to serve as the 
hometown paper for american military personnel posted overseas 
the papers have a long history that dates to publication in france 
during world war i 
the papers are staffed by military as well as civilian 
journalists but both papers are led by an officer who holds the 
title of commander and editorinchief those officers in turn 
must answer to the heads of the european and pacific commands 
the pentagon describes the papers as authorized but unofficial 
publications both operate under a charter to provide a free 
flow of news and information without censorship or news 
management 
in reality however reporters who have worked for the papers say 
they always walk a tightrope between reporting the news and 
satisfying military commanders worried about upsetting the host 
country 
examples of the problem are among those that prompted proxmire to 
demand an investigation there have been persistent reports the 
pacific edition of stars amp stripes killed stories on the results of 
aids testing and the fact that some military wives were working in 
japan as bar hostesses 
according to the sources the gao reviewed those and other cases 
of alleged censorship then asked an advisory panel from the sigma 
delta chi professional journalism fraternity to help characterize 
the handling of each story as either typical news judgment or 
censorship 
sdx didnt characterize all of the gao cases as censorship and 
quite frankly that lends credibility to the report one source 
said but there is overwhelming evidence of censorship

a federal judge ruled wednesday that 
brooklynborn rabbi meir kahane can travel here from israel for a 
speaking tour while he challenges a government finding that he had 
renounced his us citizenship 
us district judge barrington d parker ordered the state 
department not to interfere with kahanes plan to enter the united 
states early thursday to begin a threeweek speaking tour at a 
suburban washington synagogue 
parker made the ruling at the conclusion of a 90minute hearing 
during which an attorney for kahane argued that the founder of the 
militant jewish defense league only renounced his us citizenship 
to retain his seat in the knesset the israeli parliament 
attorney nathan lewin maintained that kahane only signed 
renunciation papers when faced with the hobsons choice of 
losing his seat in the knesset or losing his american citizenship 
kahane also an israeli citizen renounced his american 
citizenship to comply with a new israeli law that prohibits knesset 
members from being citizens of other nations 
kahane sent a telegram to withdraw the renunciation after the 
israeli supreme court ruled his antiarab political party was racist 
and therefore ineligible to partcipate in the nov 1 parliamentary 
election 
the law requiring kahane to renounce his us citizenship to keep 
his parliamentary seat was a figurative gun at his head lewin 
said 
did he cross his fingers when he signed the oath the judge 
said 
lewin replied that kahane issued a public statement explaining 
the reason for his renunciation and filed a written version with 
us embassy officials when he signed the oath 
assistant us attorney michael l martinez argued that kahane 
knew exactly what he was doing it was a voluntary choice 
he cited several court cases in which americans who had renounced 
their nationality to qualify for jobs in foreign countries were not 
allowed later to reclaim their citizenship 
he has affirmatively gone in to renounce his citizenship not 
being a citizen anymore he has no right to come into this country 
on a us passport martinez said he knew what the consequences 
of his choice were therefore it was voluntary 
martinez noted that because kahane had signed the incorrect form 
on aug 16 he returned to the tel aviv embassy in september and 
for a second time renounced his citizenship by filling out the 
correct papers 
lewin said kahane should not be stripped of his citizenship 
rights until the court rules on whether his renunciation was valid 
they dont have a constitutional right to take something away 
from him as precious as citizenship without an adversary hearing 
lewin said 
he accused the state department of trying to muzzle kahane whose 
extremist views have been the focus of controversy both here and in 
israel 
because meir kahane is a notorious figure and people know about 
him the state department is taking a strong line lewin said 
they dont want him here 
whether they agreed or disagree with him this is a country 
where he has a right to come and speak lewin said 
four years ago a federal judge rejected the state departments 
claim that kahane had renounced his citizenship by taking a seat in 
the knesset

the soviet union said wednesday it will launch its 
space shuttle buran on an unmanned mission this week following 
months of delays similar to those that plagued the maiden voyage of 
its us counterpart 
a government commission set the launch for 623 am moscow time 
saturday 1123 pm edt friday after receiving reports from 
specialists following several thousand tests of the buran and its 
booster rocket the energia the official news agency tass reported 
buran is russian for snowstorm an appropriate name since the 
first snow of the season fell this week in moscow 
preparations for pouring nearly 2000 tons of liquid hydrogen 
oxygen and hydrocarbon fuel into energia billed as the worlds most 
powerful booster rocket are to begin thursday tass said the 
rocket is capable of carrying more than 100 tons of cargo into earth 
orbit and up to 20 tons to the planets mars and venus 
staterun television on wednesday showed the white deltashaped 
buran with its name emblazoned in red attached to the energia on a 
launch pad at the soviet unions baikonur cosmodrome on the central 
asian steppes of the republic of kazakhstan 
launch was originally planned for the first half of this year 
but was postponed as technical problems arose officials said a 
soviet tv announcer indicated wednesday the launch time could be 
pushed back because tests of systems may take longer than 
anticipated 
the 29th of october is a day when confidence hopes and fears 
will be confirmed or refuted the announcer said 
the maiden flight of the us shuttle columbia in 1981 was 
postponed many times because of technical snags 
soviet officials have said the first flight would be pilotless to 
prevent accidents like the jan 28 1986 explosion of the us 
shuttle challenger seven astronauts were killed in that blast 
soviet media did not say how long burans mission would last if 
the test flight is successful a mission with two cosmonauts is to 
follow but soviet officials have not said when 
on sept 29 tass said the first mission was planned to conduct 
a comprehensive flight test of the spaceships design and its 
onboard systems without a crew on board during liftoff in orbit 
and during automatic landing as well as to continue upgrading the 
booster rocket and ground flight control aids 
the soviet shuttle program has been shrouded in secrecy since it 
began in 1982 and soviet foreign ministry officials said wednesday 
foreign reporters would not be allowed to travel to baikonur for the 
launch 
what little information the soviets have given about the shuttle 
has appeared timed for political purposes to highlight the 
capabilities of their manned space program as measured against the 
american counterpart 
tass transmitted the first pictures of the soviet shuttle on 
sept 29 at about the same time the us shuttle discovery was 
launched from cape canaveral fla the discovery mission marked a 
return of the american manned space program after a 2year 
suspension caused by the challenger accident 
the soviets may also use the test flight to highlight what they 
claim is the peaceful nature of their space program the next us 
shuttle the atlantis will be launched in november and is to carry 
a military payload

christa mcauliffes husband and parents 
wednesday helped break ground for a pyramidshaped planetarium 
honoring the teacher killed along with six other astronauts aboard 
the space shuttle challenger 
she was the most humble of persons she would be embarrassed to 
have her name on a building said steven mcauliffe who said his 
wife believed she was representing all teachers in the space program 
about 1000 people gathered on frostcovered grass at the new 
hampshire technical institute teachers and school officials from 
concord as well as children and other residents caught up in the 
excitement that led to challengers flight and the grief that 
followed its destruction on jan 28 1986 
the 26 million planetarium is expected to be dedicated in 
january 1990 during the day the glass exterior will reflect the 
clouds at night the moon and stars 
the key feature will be a computer projection system that 
simulates space travel and shows the skys changes over 2 million 
years 
visitors under the 40foot dome will experience the sights of 
moving through space or view the night sky as if they were part of a 
lunar expedition and watch the earth rise 
the project was selected from about 100 suggestions for a state 
memorial a choice mcauliffe praised i cant imagine a more 
appropriate a more fitting memorial he said 
her parents ed and grace corrigan of framingham mass wielded 
shovels in a line of dignitaries 
she would be very pleased that something like this is ongoing 
and such a positive thing for education mrs corrigan said i 
just wish she were here with us

the soviet parliament will confront a dilemma when 
it convenes thursday the need to slash an enormous budget deficit 
while soothing public anger over empty store shelves 
the 1500 deputies of the supreme soviet typically sit through 
hours of numbing speeches in their twoday autumn session before 
unanimously approving the annual budget and development plan 
this time with the example of junes vociferous communist party 
conference telling them glasnost has ripped the economic veil 
western diplomats predict the deputies may actually offer some 
candid comments on the kremlins economic plan 
they also might comment on gorbachevs proposal for 
multiplecandidate elections to a new congress of peoples deputies 
although the reform laws published last weekend are scheduled for 
consideration at a separate supreme soviet meeting in november 
thursdays session will be the first to deal openly with what the 
government acknowledges is a serious budget deficit tass the 
official news agency says that problem was passed over in silence 
previously 
some analysts say that deficit could be as high as 100 billion 
due to a combination of problems ranging from the cleanup of the 
chernobyl nuclear disaster to lost revenues from curtailed vodka 
sales 
simultaneously the soviet union is trying to fill its 
chronically empty food shelves and stop the periodic disappearance 
of everyday necessities among items unavailable in most moscow 
stores are laundry detergent razor blades and deodorant 
the leadership already has made one hard decision investment in 
heavy industry will be sharply cut back in 1989 in order to finance 
purchase of more consumer goods when president mikhail s gorbachev 
visited the siberian city of krasnayarsk last month he was besieged 
by angry citizens complaining of shortages 
for the soviet union where heavy industry has been the favored 
child for decades and where josef stalin once seriously argued that 
chronic shortages of consumer goods fueled economic growth this is 
a radical turnabout 
the tass report says the 1989 plan calls for 6 percent growth in 
consumer goods versus 25 percent in heavy industry western 
economists point out that the soviet union may never achieve these 
goals but the comparative projections imply a dramatic shift in 
underlying investment 
for example a recently completed tractor factory is being 
converted to passenger car production 
still the tasks are daunting to fulfill gorbachevs promise 
that every family will have its own apartment by the year 2000 he 
needs a crash construction program in an industry legendary for 
endless delays and careless workmanship 
even those with sufficient space may find themselves in the 10 
percent of moscows housing that lacks hot water and central heat in 
a city where the temperature drops below freezing six months out of 
the year 
gorbachevs best hope for solving the shortages is found in the 
incredible waste now blamed on central planning for example at a 
recent agricultural conference a farmer complained to gorbachev 
that he was left without fuel at harvest time because too much oil 
has been sold for hard currency to buy grain 
gorbachev himself said more than 25 percent of the nations 
harvest is lost by rotting en route to the stores 
for cutting the budget gorbachev appears to be relying on his 
plan to shift to more productive work as much as half of the bloated 
bureaucracy a mass that numbers somewhere between 18 million and 30 
million people 
he also is counting on modern and largely western technology 
to increase productivity in manufacturing in the first nine months 
of this year 1 million factory jobs were eliminated a statistic 
announced with pride in a nation that once pointed to layoffs as 
being among the horrors of capitalism 
the government statistician who revealed that figure said 
onethird of those workers retired and the other twothirds found 
positions in service industries or the new private cooperatives 
the looming question in solving the deficit however is the same 
one facing the united states will the soviet union cut its defense 
budget 
the west not to mention the soviet public may never know 
soviet military expenditures are scattered throughout the national 
budget and the official line item is a fraction of the true total 
estimated by the cia at about 15 percent of the total soviet economy 
all these challenges are coming at a time of radicial change in 
the structure of the soviet economy 
for example the development plan before the legislature calls 
for most new machinery textiles ceramics and shoes to be sold on 
an open market for the first time in more than half a century the 
ministries for machinebuilding and light industry which 
traditionally set quotas for those goods would control only a 
fraction of production 
western diplomats speaking on the condition they not be 
identified said such issues could produce fireworks at the usually 
staid supreme soviet 
in the four weeks since he slammed through a reorganization of 
the ruling politburo and central committee of the communist party 
gorbachev and his allies have hinted they intend to press for even 
more radical change 
a return to family farming conversion of even major industry to 
private cooperatives and making the ruble convertible on 
international currency markets are among the proposals being 
discussed

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis campaigned among hispanic voters wednesday shrugged off 
discouraging new polls and accused republicans of uttering a lot 
of baloney about gun controls 
dukakis met with hispanic leaders in denver the morning after a 
90minute appearance on abctvs nightline program then flew to 
pueblo in southern colorado for a large outdoor rally 
the pollsters are not going to call this election dukakis 
said its people that are going to be voting we have 13 
important days ahead of us 
dukakis again accused republican rival george bush and his allies 
of producing noise pollution and distorting the massachusetts 
governors record on such issues as gun controls 
theyre afraid if the smog clears from all the noise pollution 
that they have been laying down that people will realize that they 
dont understand average american families the democratic nominee 
said 
yes it has been a campaign of distortion and 
misrepresentation he said the latest one is gun control 
dukakis has found himself on the defensive about gun controls 
during nearly ever visit to the west where the national rifle 
association has been broadcasting commercials charging that dukakis 
would disarm gun owners 
dukakis says he does not oppose gun ownership by hunters 
sportsmen and homeowners protecting their lives and property but he 
wants to deny them to criminals 
i hope youll take that word back to your friends and 
neighbors these charges are a lot of baloney and i hope youll 
tell them that he told about 4000 people outside the pueblo 
courthouse as he stood next to a large hotair balloon 
jack kennedy said here in colorado in 1960 no attacks no 
attempt to discredit me no attempt to discredit us will keep us 
from speaking up for a stronger america dukakis said evoking 
the name of the late president who defeated richard nixon in that 
election 
for the second straight day dukakis was greerted by dismal polls 
published by leading newspapers 
a cbs newsnew york times poll placed him 13 percentage points 
behind bush a further decline in his standing since their oct 13 
debate in los angeles 
gallup polls showed dukakis trailing by 14 points among likely 
voters an earlier los angeles times poll put him nine points down 
in mustwin california 
dukakis took no questions from reporters wednesday but referred 
to the latest bad news polls during his breakfast meeting with 
hispanic members of congress and community leaders in denver 
im inspired and encouraged as i always am when i meet with 
you he told them we go forth now from denver to pueblo and on 
across this country to work to campaign and to win and were going 
to win 
dukakis aides sought to put the best face possible on the poll 
results they said the cbstimes poll did not match their own 
findings but some advisers privately did not dispute the california 
poll 
in addition a denver post poll showed him trailing by double 
digits in colorado charlie baker dukakis national field director 
said internal campaign polling showed voters trending toward us in 
the last few days 
he gave no specifics but said the national contest is very 
close 
in the past week dukakis has devoted much of his time to 
attacking what he calls lies and distortions by the bush campaign 
and the vice presidents criticism of his record on defense crime 
and other issues 
baker said that approach was working the poll results 
notwithstanding 
its clear this campaign of lies and distortions is catching up 
with these guys baker said our tracking polls showed for the 
first time when you ask who is responsible for the negative 
campaign they say george bush 
dukakis received warmly enthusiastic expressions of support from 
the hispanic leaders 
rep albert bustamante dtexas praised dukakis using the words 
liberal and technocrat which sometimes are attached to the 
democratic nominee in derision 
he said dukakis doesnt smile a lot and isnt a backslapper like 
most politicians hes a technocrat he understands management 
bustamante said 
as far as being a liberal in 1988 if liberalism means we care 
about children and we are about the elderly and we care about the 
environment and we care about family farms then i am for 
michael dukakis the liberal of 1988 
bustamante said that if there is a heavy voter turnout among 
hispanics on nov 8 70 percent or more they could swing a close 
election in dukakis favor 
gov roy romer said dukakis faces an uphill battle in colorado 
its a pretty big hill he said

increasingly violent turf battles involving 
drug dealers have pushed the nations capital to the brink of a 
homicide record this year the citys police chief said wednesday 
with less than three months remaining in 1988 285 people have 
been killed in the district of columbia two deaths short of the 
record for one year set in 1969 there were 227 homicides in 
washington last year 
we dont have organized crime in this city so we have a lot of 
young entrepreneurs fighting for turf police chief maurice t 
turner said 
there is just more and more fighting over where the drugs are 
to be sold turner told a news conference at police headquarters 
police estimate that 60 percent of this years killings have been 
drugrelated compared with 1986 when 33 percent of the homicides 
involved drugs 
the demand for crack a highly addictive cocaine derivative has 
fueled the accelerating homicide rate turner said 
this is one of the last major cities in this country to have an 
infusion of crack turner said when crack arrived in other 
cities like new york murder rates went up there too 
turner called for increased federal efforts to stem the flow of 
drugs into the united states 
the federal government must increase its commitment to 
interdict drugs at our borders and port cities turner said 
unless we intensify our efforts there the drug problem will 
continue to flourish 
more than 45000 people have been arrested since the district 
initiated a tough antidrug program in 1986 but turner said that 
for each drug dealer arrested another is ready to step forward to 
take his place 
people are willing to take the risk of going to jail in order 
to make large sums of money turner said you can make a million 
dollars a year selling drugs they dont have skills most of them 
are highschool dropouts what would you do 
although the citys police force has been cut from 5100 in 1977 
to its current level of 3800 turner said more police officers 
would not necessarily stem the drug trade instead he said having 
more officers on the streets would simply produce more arrests and 
more crowding in the citys overcrowded jails 
turner called on parents and teachers in the nations capital to 
help educate their children about the perils of drug use he said 
casual drug users as well as drug dealers are both part of the 
problem 
speeding addicts through drug treatment programs also will help 
reduce the citys appetite for narcotics turner said drug addicts 
must now wait an average of three weeks or longer to enter 
cityfunded drug treatment programs

islamic extremists claimed responsibility 
wednesday for the killing of a saudi arabian diplomat and the saudi 
ambassador said his embassy had received more than 100 threatening 
letters before the attack 
police speculated a sole gunman shot abdulgani bedawi as the 
saudi arabian embassy employee returned to his ankara apartment 
tuesday night said ankara gov saffet arikan beduk 
in beirut an extremist group calling itself islamic jihad in 
hijaz said it killed bedawi to avenge the execution of four of its 
followers 
the claim came in a typewritten arabic statement from the 
proiranian shiite group whose previous statements detailed 
underground activity against the saudi monarchy the statement was 
delivered to a western news agency in beirut 
there was no immediate response to the islamic groups claim in 
ankara 
the saudi ambassador abdulaziz khojah said bedawi had been the 
embassys telex operator for the last six years and held diplomatic 
status 
khojah said he ruled out robbery or personal conflict in the 
killing 
he added that the embassy had received more than 100 threatening 
letters written in turkish during the moslem pilgrimage season this 
summer 
without elaborating the ambassador said i dont believe the 
turks have anything to do with the incident even though the letters 
were in turkish 
saudi arabia restricted the number of moslems who could visit the 
country during the pilgrimage season this year according to each 
moslem nations population 
the decision came after a riot by iranians during the 1987 
pilgrimage to mecca that killed more than 400 iranians 
saudi arabia broke diplomatic ties with iran in april listing as 
reasons the clash in mecca and an attack on the saudi embassy in 
tehran 
a turkish official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
saudi officials had not requested extra protection for embassy 
personnel 
beduk said police had no clues on the identity of the assailant 
but believed a sole gunman killed bedawi he did not elaborate 
neighbors reported hearing no gunshots raising the possibility a 
silencer was used

the top counterterrorism official in the us 
government said wednesday he was concerned that libya might give 
chemical weapons to terrorists 
ambassador l paul bremer said that while there is no evidence 
that libya intends to arm terrorists with chemical weapons there 
are reasons to fear it might 
cia director william webster said tuesday that libyas chemical 
weapons plant was the largest detected by his agency anywhere in the 
world 
webster refused to say whether the facility was operational but 
other officials have said libya is on the verge of production 
they have no record of restraint bremer said in an interview 
wednesday were concerned and we think others should be too 
libya which appeared to suspend its support for terrorist groups 
following the us aerial bombing of tripoli in april 1986 has 
resumed its involvement in international terrorism over the past 
year bremer said 
the united states has accused libya of sponsoring attacks against 
us information agency offices in costa rica colombia and peru as 
well as a club frequented by american servicemen in naples italy 
five people were killed in the naples attack earlier this year 
specifically us officials accuse libya of backing the 
palestinian abu nidal group the irish republican army and the 
japanese red army 
bremer said libya has a track record of providing lethal 
weapons to terrorists 
he said libya provided the weapons for the abu nidal attacks in 
december 1985 at the rome and vienna airports as well as the 
palestinian factions attack on the city of poros cruise liner off 
the greek coast last july 
libya also sent sovietmade sa7 antiaircraft missiles and 
semtech explosives to the irish republican army bremer said one 
shipload of these weapons was intercepted off the french coast last 
november

a company will stop distributing a pill to induce 
abortions because of an outcry of opinion at home and abroad 
officials said wednesday 
some company sources speaking on condition of anonymity said it 
received threats of a boycott against their products especially 
from the united states 
the move was hailed by archbishop albert decourtray head of 
frances conference of roman catholic bishops 
i hope that this withdrawal is due to moral considerations and 
not to other reasons stemming from passion or violence he said in 
lourdes where the conference is meeting 
in a speech to the conference decourtray said the drug 
represented a serious threat a new step in the everyday 
acceptance of abortion 
opponents of abortion used authorization of the drug to resurrect 
the philosophical battle and repeat their longstanding positions 
the pharmaceutical company roussel uclaf said the decision to 
stop worldwide distribution of the highly effective pill known as 
ru 486 came in response to the outcry of public opinion at home 
and abroad against the drug 
the pill is an antihormone that works against the female hormone 
progesterone which is vital to a normal pregnancy the new drug 
blocks implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall 
ru 486 is about 80 percent effective when used alone with a 
second product called sulprotone or prostaglandine e it is more 
than 95 percent effective 
the new drug is not a doityourself morningafter pill that can 
be purchased at the supermarket and taken at home it must be used 
under supervision of medical specialists in a hospital 
on sept 23 french health minister claude evin authorized 
prescription of the drug subject to strict conditions it was 
delivered on an experimental basis to about 100 hospitals where 
abortions are performed 
the government decision gave roussel uclaf which invested much 
money in developing the drug the green light to put it on the 
market the product already had been approved by the chinese 
government 
officials at roussel who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the company had received threats of boycott against all its 
products especially from abroad and especially from the united 
states 
abortion has been legal in france a predominantly roman catholic 
country since 1975 evin said that authorization of ru 486 in no 
way changed existing french law on abortions and that they still 
would be carried out under strict legal conditions 
dr arlette geslin roussels director of medical relations said 
company officials were not suspending distribution of the drug 
because of any harmful side effects found in testing 
that is not the case she said and if it had been we 
would have said it was the factor that motivated our decision 
roussel uclaf is part of the giant west german chemical group 
hoescht which has the majority share the french government has a 
36 percent share

oxford university launched a usstyle 
worldwide appeal wednesday for more than 380 million to help 
overcome a funding crunch that school officials blame mostly on 
government cutbacks 
oxford was built on private philanthropy until about 1920 then 
forgot how to do it said henry drucker director of the campaign 
so we have to go back to the united states and in a sense learn 
what we taught them in the first place 
the ancient school which already has gained pledges of 90 
million in its 387 million drive will ask alumni and companies to 
help bolster its 10 million endowment refill the nearly 10 percent 
of its faculty posts left vacant and support other projects 
we aim to be a trailblazer and change the climate of opinion 
where corporations realize they should be supporting universities 
as they do in the united states said vice chancellor sir 
patrick neill 
about 35 students mounted a protest against the campaign saying 
oxford should have pressured the government harder before asking for 
private support said university spokeswoman anne lonsdale about 25 
other students demonstrated nearby in support of the appeal 
the fiveyear drive will include not only fundraising letters but 
also the universitys first alumni magazine oxford today which 
was mailed wednesday the campaign will have an office in new york 
and possibly tokyo 
the university which received its first charter in 1213 has 
left 122 of its 1420 faculty posts vacant as part of a retrenchment 
program brought on by an 11 percent cut in government funding for 
19861991

democratic underdog michael dukakis is all over 
the airwaves in an unprecedented blitz of television interviews that 
analysts say cant hurt him but probably wont sway enough voters to 
win him the presidency 
dukakis is snapping up television invitations with record speed 
while republican george bush with doubledigit leads in most polls 
weighs when and where and whether to appear 
he has everything to gain because he has nothing to lose 
john buckley a republican consultant and cbs commentator said of 
the dukakis strategy hes behind in every poll hes behind in 
more than 40 states his only hope is to get as much exposure for 
himself as possible and hope that what he says has some resonance 
with voters 
hes in a box hes got to go on tv said michael robinson a 
georgetown university government professor and a director of the 
timesmirrorgallup voter surveys but without any real news to go 
with the media saturation no one can possibly expect that the 
election would turn around 
the massachusetts governor has no shortage of money for 
television advertising but his campaign has decided that voters in 
addition to 30second doses of their candidate and his message also 
need lengthier exposures such as dukakis 90minute interview with 
ted koppel tuesday night on abcs nightline 
this a chance to have people see the real mike dukakis 
spokesman mark gearan said wednesday what weve seen over the 
last 20 months is that the more you see him the more you like him 
the bush camp which tried to neutralize the nightline 
appearance in some parts of the country with repeated airings during 
commercial breaks of an ad accusing dukakis of opposing virtually 
every defense system we developed predictably takes the opposite 
view 
the more you see and hear him the less enchanted you are with 
him said bushs ad director sig rogich who has studied tapes of 
dukakis in every primary season debate 
the success of the saturation strategy hinges on which way 
dukakis comes across to undecided americans and whether any of 
them are still willing to listen only about a quarter of probable 
voters are undecided at this stage of the game according to a new 
cbsnew york times poll 
dukakis aides put out the word wednesday that the candidates 
nightline appearance was a terrific session for dukakis 
the people who watch nightline are serious people who wanted 
to know what this man believes in he did exactly what he 
thought he had to do said dukakis adviser steve engelberg 
but dukakis passed up numerous chances during the interview to 
stress his new populist image as a fighter for main street 
americans a president who would be on your side he also failed 
to dispute a koppel suggestion that bush has nailed your hide to 
the wall 
larry sabato a political scientist at the university of 
virginia called the show the dullest interview ive ever seen ted 
koppel conduct dukakis answers just werent that lively or 
interesting and he missed so many opportunities to make useful 
points from his perspective something to warm him up something to 
make him appear more human 
sabato said dukakis appeared to loosen up in the last few minutes 
of the 90minute interview by then 90 percent of the audience had 
fallen asleep or gone to bed the most important minutes were the 
first 10 
dukakis will have a least a few more chances to improve his 
performance 
hes scheduled for 14 minutes thursday night with dan rather on 
cbs an appearance next week with tom brokaw on nbc and an interview 
with david frost nov 6 on the fox broadcasting network 
hes already appeared on the morning news shows and the larry 
king talk show on cnn his wife kitty was on cbs face the 
nation his running mate sen lloyd bentsen was on abcs this 
week with david brinkley and was scheduled for a rather interview 
wednesday night 
its probably true what the republicans believe that the more 
you see this guy the less excited youre going to be about him 
said robinson i cant imagine hes going to push people into his 
column by force of personality but he cant hide now hes got to 
come out hes got to be michael dukakis and he will go down in an 
honorable defeat 
regardless of dukakis fate sabato said the media should be 
congratulated for giving him so much exposure theyre saying no 
longer will we let one candidate refusing to appear be an 
insurmountable roadblock to more campaign coverage he said i 
hope the policy will be carried through in future elections

a judge on wednesday refused a request 
to read in court the 48000page file related to a soccer riot that 
killed 39 people 
judge pierre verlynde also refused to give free copies to lawyers 
defending those charged in the case 
some of the lawyers for the 26 britons charged with involuntary 
manslaughter threatened to abandon the trial after the ruling but 
they later returned 
verlynde said that parts of the court file specifically 
concerning each defendant could be read in court when appropriate 
the reading of the full file would have taken several months 
television footage of the riots at the 1985 european champions 
cup at heysel stadium showed that british fans tore down a fence 
separating them from italian fans and charged them in the panic 
that followed 39 fans died including 34 italians and more than 
500 were injured 
the britons were extradited to belgium last year after they were 
identified from the tv footage 
since oct 18 proceedings have been dominated by legal wrangling 
over whether the defense could have free copies of the court file to 
study at home 
copies of the file can be studied in a court office and the trial 
has already been postponed half a year to allow the defense more 
time to better prepare their case 
but since the reopening of the trial oct 18 the defense has 
continued to insist on more copies 
each of the britons facer up to 10 years in jail 
along with the britons two belgian police officers and a former 
belgian soccer federation chairman are accused of doing a poor job 
of organizing security at the match they face up to two years in 
jail

the new industry minister called wednesday 
for a quick end to meat rationing and he said the market must 
determine prices 
meat and gasoline are the only items still rationed since the 
government introduced widespread rationing in 198081 
the new minister mieczyslaw wilczek said he has always 
maintained that it was abnormal that there is food rationing in 
a country that has 125 acres of land per capita 
we want to lift rationing as soon as possible he said we 
must be careful with meat prices because we burned ourselves a few 
times with it thats not the way the market should decide how much 
ham costs 
under rationing each person gets 5 pounds of meat a month 
except manual laborers such as miners and steelworkers who receive 
nearly 10 pounds meat also can be bought without ration cards at 
private meat shops where the price is about three to four times as 
much as meat bought with the cards 
wilczek a wealthy private businessman and member of the 
communist party outlined his views to improve polands ailing 
economy at his first news conference since parliament confirmed him 
as industry minister on oct 14 
before joining the government wilczek was coowner with foreign 
investors of a feed concentrate company but he has sold his share 
worth 215000 he said in an interview with the express wieczorny 
newspaper this month 
wilczeks wealth and privatesector experience have aroused wide 
interest in poland and he is seen as prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowskis most innovative appointment in the new cabinet 
the previous government resigned sept 19 after fierce criticism 
for mishandling the partyapproved economic reform program and 
rakowski the former party propaganda chief was approved as the new 
prime minister sept 27 
in the past the government has favored heavy industry 
subsidizing inefficient industries such as steel shipbuilding and 
coal production and neglected production of consumer goods and 
service sectors 
but the rakowski government has decided to put priority on the 
development of agriculture housing and environmental protection 
sectors of the economy and big factories will have to tighten their 
belts to survive wilczek said 
there are major industrial companies that have negative yield 
i understand that as soon as possible those companies must be closed 
down 
wilczek singled out the shipbuilding industry as a target for 
restructuring the government has been considering closing the lenin 
shipyard in gdansk where the solidarity trade union was born 
because it is considered unprofitable 
perhaps fewer and fewer shipyards would make for more efficient 
shipyards wilczek said without specifying which ones might be 
eliminated 
he also said that one solution to polands economic problems 
would be to facilitate the creation of small enterprises especially 
service and commercial operations 
laws and rules which hinder the development of light industry 
will be changed to make it easier for entrepreneurs to do business 
he said 
reviving the economy is one of the major challenges facing the 
government inflation is 60 percent and the foreign debt stands at 
around 40 billion

the soviet union would probably rather see vice 
president george bush elected president because he would be far more 
predictable than democrat michael dukakis former secretary of state 
henry a kissinger said wednesday 
a dukakis victory would bring about so many uncertainties and 
so much confusion kissinger said at a national press club 
luncheon kissinger also said he has a higher regard for republican 
vice presidential nominee dan quayle than the public perception of 
him 
based on contact he has had with quayle in the indiana senators 
role on the armed services committee kissinger said that quayle 
knows a great deal about arms control 
in the area of foreign policy he has a good basis together 
with the experience he will undoubtedly gain as vice president 
kissinger said 
kissinger who served in the nixonford administrations said 
that dukakis has a 1960s view of the role of american power 
i think hes deeply distrustful of american power kissinger 
said even when he supports this or that weapons system it does 
not form part of any coherent strategy 
i really believe that gov dukakis does not have the grasp of 
foreign policy to deal with the issues kissinger said

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski and 
roman catholic primate cardinal jozef glemp met wednesday at a 
church palace in the medieval capital city of gniezno church and 
state officials said 
jaruzelski first secretary of the polish united workers 
communist party was met glemp at a church palace in gniezno and 
toured the citys 14th century gothic cathedral 
the small city in central poland 145 miles west of warsaw is 
the original capital of poland and the seat of christianity in the 
country dating back more than 1000 years glemp is archbishop of 
gniezno and warsaw 
there was no announcement of the topics of the jaruzelskiglemp 
talks the latest in a series of meetings between the two in recent 
years 
but the meeting coincided with difficulties over the convening of 
talks between the authorities and opposition on polands future the 
talks originally were to have begun last week but the government has 
raised objections to two of the proposed delegates of the banned 
solidarity trade union 
the church has strongly promoted dialogue between officials and 
solidarity and the leader of the catholic club of intelligentsia in 
warsaw andrzej stelmachowski has been a key figure in attempting 
to set up the talks 
the meeting also came after church sources at the vatican said 
the polish government recently offered to sign a concordat giving a 
legal basis for church activities in poland in exchange for 
establishment of full diplomatic relations between poland and the 
holy see 
the corcordat would replace an agreement that existed between the 
church and polands government before world war ii which was never 
renewed after introduction of communist rule

the presidents of seven south 
america countries arrived wednesday to seek common positions on 
strife in central america that has resisted peace efforts 
the leaders of the countries known as the group of eight also 
will discuss drug trafficking and foreign debt at their sessions 
thursday 
panama the eighth member of the group was suspended after gen 
manuel antonio noriega the nations military leader ousted 
president eric delvalle 
conflict in central america is like a red light within a world 
tending toward the solution of regional conflicts argentinas 
undersecretary for latin american affairs alberto ferrari 
etcheberry said before the meeting 
pointing to the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan the end of 
iraqs war with iran and signs that angolas civil war may be 
winding down etcheberry said the case of central america is not 
advancing and on the contrary is entering a period of paralysis 
in nicaragua rebels financed and armed by the united states are 
trying to overthrow the leftist government of president daniel 
noriega neighboring el salvador has endured a guerrilla war since 
1980 thousands have died in both countries 
the group of eight is an outgrowth of the socalled contadora 
group which was formed in 1983 by mexico colombia venezuela and 
panama to promote peace in central america argentina brazil 
uruguay and peru formed the contadora support group in 1985 
a year later leaders of the eight countries decided to meet 
regularly and discuss issues on a broader front including trade 
foreign debt and international drug trafficking 
developing a foreign debt strategy may be the most pressing topic 
on their agenda the countries are using ever greater shares of 
their national budgets for repaying that debt but the money is 
needed for investment and restructuring their economies 
you cant condemn an entire continent to stagnation because 
that conspires against hemispheric security and universal justice 
argentine president alfonsin said in a speech to the world business 
council on monday 
latin american countries owe more than 400 billion to a range of 
public and private creditors and the group of eight represents more 
than 320 billion of that amount 
aides who have been drafting the final communique for the group 
also said it will call for a reduction of trade barriers erected by 
developed countries

reagans spoke to a fundraising luncheon for maryland gop 
senatorial candidate alan keyes on the eve of a weeklong campaign 
foray to california and several other states the president will 
make appearances in little rock ark springfield mo and san 
diego on thursday before traveling to los angeles 
the white house also announced that toward the end of the trip 
reagan will attend a rally for sen chip hecht rnev in reno next 
tuesday and then go to wisconsin to campaign for senate candidate 
susan engeleiter 
since labor day reagan has visited 13 states the bulk of them 
in the heavily competitive industrial midwest and in key 
midatlantic border states 
reagan traveled by helicopter to downtown bltimore in what was 
his first campaign appearance this year in maryland a key border 
state that has been shown by polls to be leaning toward bush despite 
its heavy democratic registration and voting record 
invoking the lword reagans codeword for liberal the 
president likened dukakis to incumbent sen paul sarbanes dmd 
without actually using either ones names 
the incumbent and the stealth candidate at the top of the 
liberal ticket are so alike they could be twins he said 
now some people think i shouldnt be using the lword 
reagan said they say im labeling them 
what should we call those people who oppose the death penalty 
who support policies that hand out weekend furloughs to convicted 
murderers who support laws that make it easier for a criminal to 
own a gun than lawabiding citizens who want to protect their homes 
and children he asked 
as i say i thought about it and then i decided that if the 
label fits they ought to wear it reagan said 
reagan urged maryland republicans to work hard for keyes a 
former state department and united nations official who is 
challenging sarbanes a democrat seeking reelection to a third term 
the president said keyes is running for senate against an 
incumbent you dont hear a lot about while the senates in session 
some say he stays out of the limelight because he doesnt like 
publicity 
i think its because if the good people of maryland knew more 
about him theyd figure out the kind of senator he really is and 
hed have to leave town faster than the guy who packed up the colts 
and whisked them off to indiana in the middle of the night 
reagan was referring to robert irsay owner of the indianapolis 
colts of the national football league who moved his team out of 
baltimore at the end of the 1983 season

for peggy say this is a time of exquisite 
agony the brother she has not seen for 3 years hostage terry 
anderson marks another birthday thursday in captivity 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was abducted on march 16 1985 he is the longest held of the 
14 foreign hostages in lebanon 
but mrs say who is spending andersons 41st birthday with 
family and friends in new york lives with the hope he will be free 
by the presidential election less than two weeks away 
while she waits she and her husband david spend their time 
trying to prepare for andersons homecoming 
its such an agony of anticipation mrs say 47 said during 
a recent interview at her home in a lakeside community near cadiz 
on the one hand having been burned so many times in the past you 
try not to think about it 
i guess its an exquisite agony she said you know its 
going to happen that you are building up to it you are sure that 
the long road is at an end you can actually see it and yet you 
have to wait out the time in between 
the couple moved to western kentucky from batavia ny earlier 
this year mrs say was weeks away from a college degree in social 
work when anderson was abducted she left school and has devoted 
herself since to gaining andersons release 
her mission has enabled her to put aside her fear of flying and 
her uneasiness around crowds 
she has led candlelight vigils outside the white house and had 
coffee with president reagan in 1986 she made a 5000mile trip to 
the middle east she has appeared on national talk shows and held 
her own with dignitaries including henry kissinger 
she has met with former hostages and received letters from people 
who praised her for her courage she also has defended her brothers 
right to have remained in lebanon when challenged by listeners on 
radio callin shows 
somewhere along the way she has shed her fear of feeling 
intimidated 
the one truth ive learned is that people are just people no 
matter what their position that has made me more comfortable 
knowing theres nobody ive met up to this point that has 
intimidated me she said 
so i doubt that that will ever happen in my lifetime which is 
a good feeling to know that no matter what happens you are able to 
cope

the general assembly voted 1460 on 
wednesday to condemn south africas segregated municipal elections 
the united states and britain abstained 
south africans of all races voted wednesday for racially 
segregated municipal councils nationwide antiapartheid activists 
urged an election boycott in defiance of stateofemergency 
regulations 
the un resolution introduced by ambassador wilbert k chagula 
of tanzania on behalf of the african group in the assembly also 
blamed the pretoria racist regime for violence before the 
balloting including the bombing of antiapartheid organization 
offices 
it called the election an insidious maneuver by the racist 
minority regime of south africa that will entrench white 
minority rule and cause more conflict 
us ambassador patricia m byrne said the united states wants 
reform and the abolition of apartheid but could not support the 
resolution because it was unbalanced and biased in blaming all 
the violence on south african officials 
she said the resolution failed to mention antiapartheid 
guerrillas who bombed public places and targeted election officials 
for assassination 
sir crispin tickell the british ambassador also said his nation 
believes the resolution was onesided he said its description of 
apartheid as a threat to international peace and security was 
exaggerated 
tickell said it was unwise to pass resolutions condemning south 
africa while it is involved in delicate negotiations with cuba and 
angola on a cuban troop withdrawal from angola and independence for 
namibia 
the resolution also called for ending south africas ban on 
opposition political organizations lifting the state of emergency 
withdrawing south african troops from black townships amnesty for 
political exiles and freeing all political prisoners and 
detainees 
it said south africa should hold elections on the basis of 
universal adult sufferage in an unfragmented south africa 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

shirley dupuis and her husband hardly spoke 
a word to each other on the 3hour ride home the exhilaration of 
three days earlier had turned into gloom in the woods of northern 
new hampshire 
they failed to get a moose 
its all over but the crying she said this week following 
new hampshires first moose hunt since 1901 she was among the 75 
chosen by lottery for the hunt fiftyseven hunters got a moose 
they werent alone in their failure but it sure feels like 
it said mrs dupuis 34 my husband took it pretty hard she 
said 
they had done all the right things they scouted the area and saw 
moose before the hunt and when the season started they hunted from 
sunrise to sunset but they never glimpsed one of the huge animals 
during the hunt 
youve just got to be in the right place at the right time 
she said 
new hampshire wildlife officials decided to hold the hunt because 
of pressure from hunters who said the herd was on the rebound more 
than 4000 moose are in the state according to estimates 
one protest against the hunt was held but only about a dozen 
people attended state officials have scheduled a larger hunt next 
year 
leslie reed 57 of concord and his partner ron clair had no 
luck in bagging a moose either 
i thought for sure i could almost guarantee wed get one 
reed said 
we did a lot of scouting and saw a lot of moose reed said 
when the hunt began last tuesday they saw a huge bull about 700 
yards away shortly after sunrise but when they tried to sneak up on 
him he was gone 
then on friday the day after the hunt ended two moose walked 
into their camp 
all reed could do was lift his camera instead of his gun

rep pat swindall gave up any hope of a 
preelection verdict in his perjury trial wednesday when a judge 
dismissed the jury because the congressman had mailed out campaign 
literature mentioning the case 
us district judge robert vining made it clear there would be no 
further attempt to seat a jury before the nov 8 election the 12 
jurors and two alternates selected over three days were excused 
before hearing any arguments or testimony 
vining also rejected a request by the twoterm republican to 
proceed with a nonjury trial in which the judge renders the 
verdict 
im disappointed swindall said but he expressed no regrets 
over the campaign mailings one of which included his claim that he 
passed a private polygraph test about his truthfulness 
i very much would have liked to have had an exoneration before 
the election he said however i knew that with a campaign with 
only two weeks to go and with the issue of perjury uppermost in 
many peoples minds that it was important for me to get that 
polygraph evidence out to the voters of the 4th district because it 
totally exonerates me 
the government contends an agent posing as a money broker told 
swindall that an 850000 home mortgage the congressman was seeking 
might be drug money prosecutors said swindall lied in telling a 
grand jury he did not remember such a warning 
the judge in dismissing the jury cited two pieces of campaign 
literature that he said could have reached potential jurors 
he said he also wants authorities to investigate whether 
swindall who is representing himself violated court rules 
governing the comments lawyers may make about their cases 
it became apparent this morning that it would be extremely 
difficult for you to try a case during a political campaign when one 
of the parties is involved in the campaign vining told the jurors 
later he added i just believe myself its not the time and 
place to try the case so im not going to 
swindall is locked in a reelection battle with democrat ben 
jones a former actor who played cooter on televisions dukes of 
hazzard 
swindall said wednesday that if there is no verdict before the 
election he will ask voters to support him with the understanding he 
would resign if convicted that approach he said would ensure that 
a new gop candidate could run 
i believe they will reelect me with the understanding that an 
exoneration after the election is just as good as an exoneration 
before the election he said 
jones would not comment on the case we had an 18point lead 
before the indictment and we got it not because of his problems 
but because of our hard work he said 
a poll by the atlanta journalconstitution after swindalls oct 
17 indictment found jones leading 53 percent to 27 percent 
the campaign one of the bitterest in the country has featured 
swindalls repeated questions about jones admitted bout with 
alcoholism 
swindall has been hounded by news reports of the investigation 
that led to his indictment and jones once suggested the congressman 
be tested for drug use and psychiatric problems 
swindall gave up the right to make many pretrial arguments 
including a claim that he was being prosecuted for political gain 
and successfully pushed for a trial date just a week after the 
indictment on 10 counts of perjury 
opening arguments had been scheduled for wednesday but vining 
opened the days session by introducing the mass mailings into 
evidence 
hes showed us he would rather run for office than have this 
trial said prosecutor craig gillen 
he said the mailings made it impossible to hold the trial because 
they could be delivered to jurors homes even after testimony began 
or could be mentioned to them by relatives 
swindall pleaded with the judge to question the jurors about 
whether they had received the mailings instead of dismissing the 
panel and he renewed his accusation that his indictment was timed 
to fall just before the election 
at a news conference swindall was questioned repeatedly by 
reporters about whether he authorized mention of the polygraph in 
his mailing he said he had approved the mailing before a decision 
was made to add the mention of the polygraph test 
pressed about who made the decision swindall insisted he had 
answered the question until his wife broke in to say he didnt i 
did

hurricane joan spawned an intense 
political storm between the sandinistas and their opponents as it 
rampaged across nicaragua 
president daniel ortega frequently compared the hurricanes 
assault to attacks by guerrillas and said the best relief aid the 
united states could offer would be halting aid to the rebels known 
as contras 
monsignor bismarck carballo a roman catholic church spokesman 
accused the government of mixing political slogans with emergency 
broadcasts 
joan came ashore early saturday morning at bluefields flattened 
the caribbean port of 38000 people and cut a path of destruction 
across to the pacific in the following 24 hours 
it killed at least 60 people and left 300000 homeless nicaragua 
issued a general appeal for emergency assistance nations as diverse 
as britain and cuba responded with aid but the united states said 
it probably would not 
ortega said wednesday the hurricane had destroyed a key farming 
and ranching area in central nicaragua after touring the region he 
said joan wiped out cattle herds pastures forests grain crops 
more than 20000 homes in 22 communities in 40 square miles 
the official radio voice of nicaragua described the district 90 
miles east of managua as the countrys main farming and ranching 
area 
political barbs began last week as the storm approached the 
caribbean coast after the us congress approved a resolution 
leaving open the possibility of renewed aid to the contras 
it is inconceivable that while nicaraguans face the threat of 
catastrophe the american congress maintains its threat to escalate 
the war ortega said 
the contras and sandinistas agreed in march to a ceasefire but 
further talks broke off in september most rebels moved to base 
camps in honduras in the last few months but both sides still 
report minor skirmishes 
nicaraguas economy has been devastated by seven years of civil 
war which the government says has cost 7 million 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday of ortega 
it seems clear he wants to use this storm as another platform for 
propaganda against the contras 
in his complaints about propaganda during the hurricane 
emergency carballo said the voice of nicaragua started to 
transmit that neither president reagan nor joan would destroy the 
revolution 
antius rhetoric has caused the government problems among the 3 
million nicaraguans some refused to evacuate for joan because they 
said the sandinistas had lost their credibility by warning 
repeatedly of imminent us invasions 
people are tired of hearing these calls and dont believe 
them said ruben hernandez who refused to leave his home in a 
poor lowlying neighborhood of managua 
both fitzwater and nicaraguas sole opposition newspaper la 
prensa criticized an emergency law that suspended articles of the 
constitution dealing with freedom of speech for 30 days which 
includes the us election nov 8 
to do it at this time under cover of a storm is no worse really 
than the performance he has displayed for the past six or seven 
years in terms of closing down the press fitzwater said 
while touring devastated bluefields on monday ortega said 
nicaragua might accept us government hurricane aid if it was 
offered without conditions and expressed certainty that help 
would come from private american groups that oppose their 
governments central america policy 
on tuesday the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario said 
nicaragua did not want aid from washington 
fitzwater said monday the united states feared any emergency aid 
it offered would help nicaragua against the contras 
in reply the government newspaper barricada said its better 
for the yankees to keep their blankets milk for children and 
medicine for our homeless brothers 
bluefields fisherman aster gerth asked a visitor however do 
you think the united states will help the russians and the cubans 
cant do what the united states can 
roberto arguello director of the nicaraguan american bankers 
association said most nicaraguan exiles in miami had the attitude 
let the russians help them out 
cuba sent hurricane experts before the storm hit and sheltered 
nicaraguan air force planes at its airfields cuban doctors and 
emergency supplies arrived immediately after joans departure

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan says 
the fund insuring savings and loan deposits needs more money but 
requiring the fed to help bail it out could set a dangerous 
precedent 
as savings institution losses have mounted congressional debate 
has intensified over whether taxpayers must pay to bailout the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp and over alternatives to 
tax money 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates sampls and 
oversees the insurance fund maintains the assessment levied on the 
industry can cover the costs 
but many analysts and now greenspan agree that the insurance 
funds current flow of revenue isnt enough 
clearly the fslic will need additional resources greenspan 
said in a statement released wednesday by the senate banking 
committee 
but he added that any move to tap the fed for money would mark 
a sharp departure from the view traditionally held in our nation 
that the resources of the federal reserve should not be used for 
special purposes and would set a dangerous precedent for the 
future 
he also said that funding from the federal reserve would add to 
the federal budget deficit essentially in the same way as a budget 
expenditure 
the fed as the nations central bank uses its funds to control 
inflation in the economy intervene in foreign exchange markets and 
act as a lender of last resort during financial crises such as the 
october 1987 stock market crash 
greenspans remarks made in a statement dated oct 17 were 
offered in response to questions submitted july 29 by the banking 
committee on a wide range of subjects 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich who is expected to become 
chairman of the committee next year asked greenspan about a 
proposal to require the fed to pay interest on reserves it hold from 
us commercial banks and channel the money to the fslic another 
suggestion would require the fed to accept as collateral for loans 
fslic notes issued to ailing sampls 
greenspan offered no solution to the sampl crisis but said his 
agency would express its views when congress takes up the topic in 
the meantime he said the federal reserve banks would act as a 
lender of last resort to sampls in trouble if the federal home loan 
bank system cannot 
his comments came three weeks after l william seidman chairman 
of the insurance fund for commercial banks told the american 
bankers association he would fight any attempt to tap the federal 
deposit insurance corp 
government estimates have put the cost of restoring the sampl 
industry to solvency at 45 billion to 50 billion with private 
analysts setting the cost at up to 100 billion 
greenspan said great uncertainty surrounds estimates of sampl 
losses because relatively small changes in the value of real 
estate securing loans to troubled institutions can have a major 
impact on the magnitude of thrift industry losses 
but it is clear that the fslic is facing large problems 
which are going to be with us for some time to come he said

the government should step up research and 
promotion of socalled lowinput farming to halt contamination of 
groundwater with nitrates and pesticides a house panel said 
wednesday 
given the seriousness of the problems besetting agriculture 
today the least we can do is ensure that this option is available 
for farmers said rep mike synar dokla chairman of the 
environment energy and natural resources subcommittee 
the panel released a report based on a yearlong investigation of 
the pesticide issue low input farming systems benefits and 
barriers 
lowinput farming refers to techniques ranging from 
chemicalfree or organic agriculture to the careful targeting 
and reduced use of chemical pesticides on crops 
the epa estimates that of 11 billion pounds of pesticides used 
in the united states in 1984 77 percent or 861 million pounds 
were applied to agricultural crops 
these chemicals some of which have been linked to cancer and 
other health problems along with nitrates from agricultural 
fertilizers have increasingly been found in groundwater which 
furnishes the major drinking supply to almost half of all americans 
while a lowinput management system is not a cureall for 
agricultures troubles it offers the potential of improving the 
efficiency of farm operations by lowering input costs and reducing 
contaminants that end up in the soil and groundwater synar said 
the panel reported that even when cutting back on pesticides had 
reduced crop yield some farmers reported greater net earnings 
because of reduced production costs 
but the epa has focused little attention on nonchemical methods 
in reaching its regulatory decisions the report said poor 
coordination between the agency and the agriculture department are 
to blame it said 
the panel also cited an array of barriers to widespread adoption 
of lowinput methods to us farming they included lack of 
research chemical industry influence on farmers limited 
information available and worry among agricultural producers that 
switching to alternative production methods would risk shortterm 
income loss 
in 1985 the report said congress authorized the agriculture 
department to develop a lowinput farming methods program it said 
however that the department did not request money for it and that 
it remained unfunded until lawmakers approved 41 million in the 
fiscal year that ended last month

a national poll wednesday gave george bush an 
eightpoint advantage over michael dukakis in the race for 
president a somewhat smaller lead than the republican nominee 
enjoyed in two earlier polls this week 
the abc newswashington post poll of 1242 likely voters put the 
contest at 5244 percent closer than the 13point gap in a cbs 
newsnew york times poll and the 14 points among likely voters in a 
gallup poll released tuesday 
the abcpost poll was conducted during the seven days ending 
tuesday rather than the three and fourday field periods of the 
earlier polls 
that could account for differing results polls done during fewer 
days are more liable to be influenced by daily movements in voter 
preference in polls done over more time changes may be tempered by 
days of stable opinion 
abcpost polls have showed slight movement in the race with bush 
ahead by six points in an oct 511 poll seven in an oct 1218 
poll and eight now the gallup and cbstimes polls done in shorter 
periods found more movement for bush after the oct 13 presidential 
debate 
the margin of sampling error in the abcpost poll was plus or 
minus three percentage points

republican george bush sounded like a man counting down the hours 
to victory in the race for the white house on wednesday as he 
renewed his pledge not to raise taxes democrat michael dukakis 
vowed to work to campaign and to win despite the odds against 
him 
the latest news from the pollsters was anything but good for the 
democrats a washington post survey in maryland one of the 
nations most democratic states showed bush with a ninepoint 
lead on top of two national polls tuesday that showed a 
doubledigit democratic deficit 
bushs lead was back down to a single digit in an abc 
newswashington post poll released late tuesday in which he was 
ahead by 5244 the survey of 1242 likely voters was conducted 
during seven days a longer sampling period than in the other 
surveys and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three 
percentage points 
the vice president began his campaign day in detroit where he 
said dukakis sounds like a man just itching to repeal the income 
tax cuts of the reagan era the vice president also defended his 
call for a capital gains tax cut from dukakis criticism 
its not a tax break for the rich it is a break for those who 
want to have a job in this country he said 
dukakis was in colorado meeting privately with hispanic leaders 
who later said high voter turnout among their constituents could 
deliver a democratic upset on election day he laid claim to strong 
hispanic support and said that was due in part to his stand against 
drugs 
they want a president who doesnt talk about the subject but 
who has done something about it he said 
in pueblo dukakis defended his record on gun control in a region 
where he has been under heavy advertising attack from the national 
rifle association dukakis said he does not oppose gun ownership by 
hunters and sportsmen and for protection 
i hope youll take that word back to your friends and 
neighbors he said these charges are a lot of baloney and i 
hope youll tell them that 
advisers insisted the campaigns own polling reflects a closer 
race than the bush lead in national polls said the candidate the 
pollsters are not going to call this election its the people who 
are going to be voting 
he added he would go on across this country to work to 
campaign and to win 
bush optimistically looked beyond the election 
if i am elected in 13 days 8 hours and 22 minutes from now 
i will work with congress got to do that telling them the 
american people in electing me voted against a tax increase he 
said now lets sit down together honor the peoples decision 
and hold spending increases to the rate of inflation 
bush also contended that there have been a staggering number 
of jobs created as a result of reaganera tax cuts 
my opponent thinks they were a disaster bush said those 
sound to me like the words of someone who is just itching to repeal 
one of the most successful economic policies in our history 
president reagan ventured into democratic maryland and said 
dukakis has unjustly accused bush of running a negative campaign 
well i think theyre squirming because george has shown 
america how far outside the mainstream they really are reagan 
said in baltimore they may not like it but george has thrown a 
clear light on their views 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen interviewed 
live on the cbs evening news nonetheless urged bush to root out 
the distortions that he is allowing in the campaign 
when asked by anchorman dan rather whether the campaign wasnt 
being hypocritical because it hadnt dealt often with black leaders 
and voters bentsen said he and jesse jackson had participated 
recently in a joint satellite session with college students the two 
men were in separate cities for that event 
bentsen also said he planned to appear with jackson this week 
campaign officials said afterward the event was still tentative 
because of jacksons schedule 
bushs running mate dan quayle was asked about a cbsnew york 
times poll that indicated he was the most unpopular of the four men 
at the top of the presidential tickets 
quayle said dukakis is the person that is unpopular in america 
hes dragging his ticket down 
when reporters pressed the indiana senator about whether he might 
be costing bush some votes quayle said as a matter of fact when 
we got on this ticket we were doubledigits behind and were doing 
quite well

a male calendar contest at a popular 
nightclub is causing a stir in this northern kentucky city and the 
clubs owner says there wouldnt be a problem if the contestants 
were women instead of men 
the monday night performance billed as the men of menagerie 
calendar contest took place as scheduled at the glass menagerie 
but city officials say the show must not go on 
the matter has been turned over to the citys legal advisers 
said zoning administrator ralph hopper 
hopper warned the nightclubs owner that the contest violates 
city zoning ordinances on adult entertainment and ordered the club 
to halt the show or face a fine 
about an hour before the monday performance lt ralph schawe 
delivered hoppers order but the show went on anyway 
it was a very professional show the costumes were fantastic 
said detective marty epperson a plainclothes officer who went to 
the contest to serve as a witness for the city 
participants wore costumes at the beginning and stripped down to 
gstrings while music played she said 
the nightclub is in a highway commercial zone in which adult 
entertainment is prohibited the club could face a fine of 10 to 
500 per day and its liquor license could be jeopardized 
the contest is no different than female calendar contests 
sponsored by other covington nightspots said glass menagerie owner 
larry grause 
participants strut their stuff for the audience which 
chooses the winner by applause he said 
as far as were concerned this a sexist type of attack 
grause said obviously it was generated by our competitors 
because it was a successful promotion 
hopper said he was unaware of similar contests at other 
nightspots

hundreds of people marched 
through the capital on wednesday the first anniversary of a human 
rights leaders slaying and amnesty international said rightwing 
death squads have reemerged 
about 500 people attended a religious service honoring herbert 
anaya sanabria then marched through the capital to lay flowers at 
his grave 
anaya 33 was gunned down on oct 26 1987 near his home in san 
salvador he was the fifth director of the salvadoran human rights 
commission to be assassinated since 1980 
the government blamed the crime on the leftist guerrilla 
farabundo marti liberation front but roman catholic church and 
humanitarian groups say it was the work of a rightist death squad 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group said 
death squads usually including soldiers or police have killed 
hundreds of people suspected of being leftists or government 
opponents in the past two years 
it said death squads are reemerging because of military 
opposition to peace negotiations with the front and that anayas 
slaying was seen as an attempt to discourage the talks 
soldiers and death squads killed tens of thousands of suspected 
leftists in the 1970s and early 1980s but death squad activity 
diminished after the usbacked civilian government came to power 
in 1984 
col jose galileo refused to comment on the amnesty international 
report but he said the armed forces would issue a bulletin on the 
issue later possibly thursday 
the government said the guerrilla front killed anaya because he 
left the front to collaborate with the military 
it said a suspected guerrilla jorge alberto miranda arevalo 
admitted killing anaya miranda 19 says he was forced to confess 
to a crime he did not commit 
anayas widow mirna perla told a news conference wednesday that 
miranda is another innocent victim 
in another incident wednesday two guerrillas broke into a radio 
station in san salvador on wednesday and broadcast a tape attacking 
duartes government the guerrillas were gone by the time police 
arrived 
the guerrillas have been fighting the usbacked armed forces 
for nine years an estimated 65000 people most of them civilians 
have died in the war

the soviet union will release all people regarded 
in the west as political prisoners by the end of the year 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany said wednesday after talks 
with president mikhail s gorbachev 
such a dramatic move would be one of the boldest signs yet from 
gorbachev that he seeks a clear break with past kremlin human rights 
practices that have included imprisonment of dissenters from 
communist party policy 
however foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov refused 
to confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners is imminent 
he told reporters there are about two dozen such prisoners 
estimates from human rights groups abroad vary from 150 to more than 
500 
gerasimov said the fate of the prisoners was not on the agenda of 
the sovietwest german negotiations that brought kohl to moscow 
kohls announcement was welcomed by soviet human rights activist 
andrei d sakharov president reagan and amnesty international but 
a leader of a group seeking emigration of soviet jews said he 
remained skeptical 
reagan asked what he thought of the report said im hoping 
thats true 
sakharov the 1975 nobel peace laureate said certainly we 
await the release of all of them prisoners and their 
rehabilitation 
in the past three days kohl held 10 hours of talks with 
gorbachev and also met with other top kremlin officials 
at a news conference called to sum up his visit kohl said the 
soviets confirmed that they will release before the end of the year 
all political prisoners as we understand it in the west 
kohl would not say whether the promise came from gorbachev only 
that it was made during the talks 
asked how many people may be freed kohls foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher said we are not in a position to give 
final figures 
neither kohl nor genscher identified prisoners who might be 
released it was not clear how many soviets classified in the west 
as political prisoners might be freed since some have been 
sentenced on criminal charges including espionage 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group says 
it knows of 150 soviets imprisoned solely for their nonviolent 
exercise of their fundamental human rights it put their number at 
10000 a few years ago 
amnestys list includes about 30 religious believers 30 
conscientious objectors to military service and about 20 people 
held for antisoviet propaganda and other offenses said spokeswoman 
carline windall 
upon request amnestys new york office named four people on the 
list of 150 believed to be prisoners of conscience 
levko lukyanenko a ukrainian lawyer and member of an unofficial 
helsinki watch committee in internal exile in the soviet union 
boris mityashin a leningrad truck driver imprisoned for 
distributing poetry disapproved of by the government vazif 
meylanov in a labor camp since 1980 for demonstrating for 
sakharovs release and enn tarto an estonian also held in a labor 
camp 
kronid lubarsky editor of country and world the respected 
emigre publication in munich said there are at least 167 soviet 
political prisoners 
a west german group the international society for human rights 
said 503 soviets are imprisoned on political or religious grounds 
many of those sent to labor camp or prisons for political 
offenses have been convicted under two clauses of the soviet 
criminal code 
article 70 outlaws antisoviet agitation and propaganda 
article 190 forbids antisoviet slander 
the only number we know is those held under article 70 and 
only those in camps sakharov said in a telephone interview he 
put the total number of those prisoners at 25 
we dont know who is in psychiatric hospitals said sakharov 
who was kept almost seven years in internal exile for condemning the 
1979 soviet military push into afghanistan 
sakharov said it was also not known how many were imprisoned for 
violating laws that regulate the practice of religion 
sergei i grigoryants one of the first political prisoners 
released under an amnesty last year said in an interview that he 
has a list of 200 people put in camps or psychiatric hospitals for 
their political beliefs 
he said he was skeptical of kohls announcement when 
authorities themselves decide who is a political prisoner its 
difficult to believe that all will really be freed said 
grigoryants editor of glasnost an unsanctioned political journal 
in new york the chairman of the national conference on soviet 
jewry morris abram also said he was skeptical 
one will have to wait to see whether or not the promise is 
confirmed by the practice abram told the associated press 
last year authorities freed at least 300 prisoners being held on 
charges including articles 70 and 190 the ruling communist party 
and government are reviewing the soviet penal code 
we are going to make some real innovations foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze said in paris on oct 11 when the code is 
published and debated there will no longer be any need to speak of 
political prisoners 
shevardnadze said about 25 to 29 soviets were also confined 
to mental institutions apparently for political offenses 
for decades the kremlins image in the west has been tarnished 
by the use of prisons labor camps mental hospitals and internal 
exile to isolate and punish dissenters or political and religious 
activists

gary f egan executive director of the massachusetts criminal 
justice training council was placed on leave of absence until the 
state attorney generals office determines what felled cadets at the 
police academy in agawam 
a statement issued by the council said egan felt his continued 
presence in the midst of press attention was interfering with the 
agencys ability to carry out its job of training police throughout 
the commonwealth 
at least 16 recruits in a class of 50 were hospitalized with 
dehydration exhaustion and kidney failure by the end of the first 
week of training at the western massachusetts academy last month 
one recruit had a liver transplant and was in a coma for two weeks 
public safety secretary charles v barry asked egan to take the 
leave from his 53000ayear job according to sources in the state 
executive office of public safety which is monitoring the council

improprieties on the staff of the 24member council which is 
comprised of police sheriff corrections and other law enforcement 
officials

the tremendous publicity given to the 
rescue of whales stranded off alaska has some people questioning the 
relative values of animal and human life the president of the 
university of notre dame said 
the rev edward monk malloy told about 300 people at a 
social concern forum tuesday that he was an animal lover but 
that the rescue attempts are more of a public relations effort to 
appease certain elements in the ecology movement to show that the 
government cares 
malloy cited the whale rescue along with longstanding social 
concerns such as abortion and hunger in the world as issues members 
of the audience should use to help examine their ethics in a context 
of being part of a global community 
we realize we are one in the midst of many and we have to ask 
can we hone in on one issue or a set of interconnected issues 
malloy said that wellmeaning people caught up by one concern 
should not overlook related problems 
he noted that civil strife and corrupt governments in africa 
sometimes divert aid offered by people moved by heartwrenching 
photographs of starving children 
so in the efforts to deal with the broadbased concerns of 
hunger good will alone will not help and we should be prudent 
malloy said 
malloy argued that even in the drive against abortion which is a 
major concern of the roman catholic church he serves it is 
important to look beyond a single issue 
being prolife has served as a rallying cry for some 
christians he said but prolife should include more than life 
in the womb concern should also be given to the life of an infant 
the life of the elderly and the life of the mentally physically and 
spiritually handicapped

a roman catholic priest who advocated a more 
compassionate view of homosexuality and later revealed that he was 
gay has been excommunicated by a church tribunal for joining the 
episcopal church 
the tribunal dismissed william dorn jr from the clerical 
state and banned him from the priesthood forever it found him 
guilty of leaving the vaticanruled church in favor of the 
britainbased protestant denomination 
the ruling puts an end to a twoyear public dispute in which dorn 
and the roman catholic church clashed over his outspoken challenges 
to church teachings on homosexuality and his ultimate revelation 
that he is gay 
its over said dorn 36 after learning of the ruling 
tuesday 
the tribunals ruling was dated sept 30 and delivered tuesday to 
dorn by his churchappointed lawyer the rev james zusy of the 
archdiocese of st paul and minneapolis dorn said that he was not 
allowed to keep a copy of the decree and was ordered not to speak 
about it 
however he notified the media and issued a statement critical of 
the church hierarchy zusy refused to discuss the matter saying 
i cannot say a word i am bound to secrecy 
former st cloud bishop george speltz suspended then fired dorn 
from his job at the christ church newman center at st cloud state 
university in october 1986 
speltz was angered by a controversial article dorn had written 
for the st cloud visitor the diocesan newspaper the article 
advocated a more compassionate view of homosexuality which dorn 
called a gift from god 
in june the threemember tribunal met in park rapids at the 
order of bishop victor balke of crookston where dorn was ordained 
in 1979 
dorn on several occasions declined an invitation to come back to 
the church on the condition he remain silent about homosexuality 
commenting on the churchs action dorn said that by silencing 
priests who challenge traditional doctrine church officials are 
losing touch with people and closing doors on the oppressed 
in fear church officials cling to the vestiges of power 
he said they speak only to themselves and so believe they are 
mighty 
dorn who lives in south minneapolis declined to discuss his 
personal life or possible plans to seek ordination in the episcopal 
church

farright white candidates 
scored major gains wednesday but black militants also showed their 
political strength by boycotting the first sameday voting by all 
races for segregated municipal councils 
in major black townships where antiapartheid activists urged a 
boycott in defiance of stateofemergency regulations turnouts 
generally were below 10 percent 
the government said the total black turnout including advance 
votes would exceed the 21 percent recorded in the previous black 
elections in 1983 
but in soweto whose 2 million residents comprise the largest 
black community in south africa election officials acknowledged 
their disappointment at an overall turnout of 115 percent 
the governments bureau for information said 30 percent of the 
25428 eligible black voters turned out in natal one of the four 
provinces 
black and white polling stations were heavily guarded by security 
forces no serious violence was reported although police said 
scattered arson and stonethrowing attacks did occur 
president pw bothas national party faced a fierce challenge 
from the extremeright conservative party which entered local 
elections for the first time since it was formed eight years ago 
many white communities had their first partisan local elections 
after decades of nationalist dominance 
the most important white battleground was pretoria the 
administrative capital where the nationalists won 22 of 42 council 
seats and the conservatives 19 the other seat went to an 
independent 
in the port city of durban rightwing candidates opposed to the 
integration of beaches won two seats from incumbents on the 
traditionally liberal city council 
in johannesburg the largest city the national party gained 
outright control at the expense of liberal candidates the 
conservatives decisively beat a nationalist candidate in mayfair 
west a bluecollar ward where nonwhites have been moving in 
violation of segregation laws 
this shows our people reject the governments move to the 
left said the conservative victor hendrick classen we want 
white areas 
the conservatives also swept to power in most rural northern 
towns and traded victories with the nationalists in bluecollar 
urban areas final results were expected thursday 
nationwide 7229 seats were at stake in 1071 communities the 
state radio said only 905 of the 1839 black council seats were 
being contested with no candidates for 138 seats 
of south africas 26 million blacks 1464198 were eligible to 
vote in contested elections polling hours varied with the earliest 
voting at 7 am and the final balloting at 9 pm 
antiapartheid clergymen such as anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize opposed the elections 
and urged south africans to fast and pray during the day 
the united nations general assembly voted 1460 on wednesday to 
condemn the elections the united states and britain abstained 
the government spent millions of dollars on advertising to 
promote a high turnout contending that it was broadening democracy 
even though blacks cannot vote in national elections 
critics say turnout percentages will have little meaning because 
millions of blacks were ineligible to vote many leading black 
opposition groups are banned 
one black who did vote siza zwane said national issues didnt 
prompt him to vote for the sofasonke party whose candidates in 
soweto have been criticized for making sweeping promises 
we are going to pay less rent and they will make the roads 
much better zwane said 
many schools in black mixedrace and asian townships near 
johannesburg and cape town were virtually deserted as students 
stayed away to protest the elections 
the conservative party won 26 percent of the vote in may 1987 
national elections its leaders believe they could seriously 
challenge the national party in parliamentary elections expected by 
1990 
the conservatives view bothas gradual race reforms as 
capitulation to the black majority and seek to reimpose strict 
segregation under apartheid the 5 million whites control the 
economy and maintain separate districts schools and health services 
the conservatives want to toughen enforcement of residential 
segregation and restrict blacks presence in urban areas 
they campaigned on these issues even though they could not 
implement them unless they ended the national partys 40year hold 
on national power 
municipal councils can evict squatters and segregate parks 
public buildings and transportation facilities 
bombings and grenade attacks have averaged more than one a day in 
south africa since september police say the attacks were part of a 
campaign by african national congress guerrillas to disrupt the 
elections

a federal courtroom rocked to creedence 
clearwater revival records wednesday as lawyers for former lead 
singer john fogerty tried to show that a song from his 1985 comeback 
album wasnt stolen from another fogerty hit 
fantasy records which recorded creedence has filed suit 
essentially accusing fogerty of plagiarizing himself 
the suit against fogerty and his current recording company 
warner bros records inc contends old man down the road a 
single from fogertys solo centerfield album copied the melody 
from run through the jungle which fogerty wrote and sang for 
creedence in 1970 and to which fantasy now owns the rights 
relations between fogerty and his former recording company have 
been bitter since creedence disbanded in 1972 fogerty had to change 
the title of one song in centerfield after saul zaentz owner of 
fantasy records said he was being libeled 
in the current case the two songs are similar in tune and 
structure as lawyers for fantasy demonstrated earlier this week in 
testimony by musicologists equipped with charts a piano and a 
computer sound system that superimposed one pattern of notes on 
another 
a defense musicologist for warner bros guided the us district 
court jurors through a series of creedence records green 
river keep on chooglin tombstone shadow and bootleg 
with his own series of elaborate charts pointing out similarities 
to run through the jungle and old man down the road 
the six jurors and four alternates who appeared to range from 
about 30 to their 60s listened to the late 1960searly 1970s medley 
with serious expressions and varied postures one middleaged man 
yawned at one point while several jurors nodded in time to the beat 
the defense witness harold barlow who described himself as a 
music plagiarism expert as well as a songwriter and arranger 
said all the songs had many notes in common 
he fogerty is working with an idea barlow said the idea 
is to use bflat and c in a repetitive structure mr fogerty 
has made this structure commonplace the way he uses them the 
expression of the idea theyre used differently 
under crossexamination barlow acknowledged that he had compared 
the two songs early in the case without examining any other songs 
and concluded they were substantially similar the standard that 
determines copyright infringement 
but he insisted that a valid comparison must also take into 
account earlier works that might have influenced later compositions 
in light of those old man down the road cant be considered a 
copy of the 1970 song barlow said 
fogerty testified briefly monday and is scheduled to appear again 
friday 
in pretrial statements read into the record wednesday by lawyers 
for fantasy fogerty said several of his songs including the two 
involved in the case used similar phrasing 
but he added in the statement as far as im concerned the two 
songs are totally different

rescue workers who have found the bodies of at least 32 people 
other reports put the death toll at 26 
carlos go president of the shipping company that owned the dona 
marilyn said 138 of the survivors had been put aboard another 
company vessel and were expected to arrive in tacloban thursday 
others remained on small islands near where the 2855ton dona 
marilyn sank the vessel was on a manilatacloban run when it sank 
in heavy seas and high winds about 300 miles southeast of the 
capital 
go said he hoped more survivors would be found 
there are plenty of islands in the area and the search was 
continuing thursday he said 
survivors told how people rushed into lifeboats or dived 
overboard as the vessel heaved in stormwhipped seas and sank 
in manila people jammed the offices of sulpicio lines which 
owned the ship seeking information about relatives who were aboard 
virginia tamban whose sister and two nieces were passengers 
said she would remain overnight to see if their names appeared on 
the list of survivors i hope they are safe she sobbed she 
said none of them knew how to swim 
raymundo adejer 27 said his sister natividad and her 
4yearold son were on the vessel although the boys name was not 
on the manifest 
i cannot blame anyone for this except the captain of the ship 
who still sailed despite reports that a storm was coming up 
adejer said 
president corazon aquino on wednesday declared a state of 
calamity in manila and 35 provinces hardest hit by typhoon ruby 
the red cross and other relief agencies said 114 people were 
killed on land by the typhoon which pummeled the entire archipelago 
nation with heavy rains and winds monday and tuesday before heading 
west toward china 
the red cross said more than 765000 filipinos were affected by 
ruby meaning their homes were destroyed damaged or flooded or 
sustained other losses the government said the storm caused 45 
million in damage to crops and destroyed 75 million worth of roads 
and bridges 
bernardo cabigon sulpicios station manager in tacloban quoted 
surviving crewmembers of the dona marilyn as saying they briefly 
tried to pump water from the ship as it listed to one side 
after they found out they could not do anything anymore they 
decided to get off he said everybody was jumping into the sea 
others took the lifeboats but there were so many people that they 
decided to jump and swim they looked very tired they stayed in the 
water for three hours 
cabigon quoted survivors as saying that some passengers were so 
frightened they claimed they saw an island nearby and swam toward 
it although the storm had reduced visibility to nearly zero at the 
time 
he quoted survivor alberto oledo as saying he jumped overboard 
with his wife son and daughter the three held hands but were 
separated in the raging seas and oledo was the only who reached 
land 
cabigon said 120 of the 179 survivors managed to reach the remote 
island of almagro in lifejackets and life boats 
go said 26 bodies were recovered but the coast guard put the 
figure at 32 there was no explanation for the discrepancy 
the dona marilyn was trying to maneuver to the western side of 
masbate island away from rubys approach to the east but was 
buffeted by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph cabigon said 
the coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listing to 
the port side in heavy seas in a radio distress signal before the 
ship went down 
mrs aquino told reporters she ordered an investigation of the 
sinking im telling the transportation minister to investigate 
this and find out why they still sailed during very bad weather 
go said he could not explain why the vessel sailed sunday 
despite the approach of the typhoon because he was unable to 
interview surviving crew members 
in december another sulpicio ship the dona paz collided with 
an oil tanker off mindoro island the official death toll was 1749 
but other estimates said more than 3000 were killed only 28 people 
survived

david dorr the ringleader of a white 
supremacist group that modeled itself on the order and launched a 
series of bombings was sentenced wednesday to up to 20 years in 
prison 
two other members of the order ii were sentenced to eight years 
in prison but a third defendant was placed on probation deborah 
dorr 36 dorrs wife and edward hawley 24 were both ordered to 
jail hawleys wife olive 29 was given a sixyear prison 
sentence but it was suspended to five years probation 
the dorrhawley group described as the order ii or bruder 
schweigen task force in documents found in the dorr home was 
apparently a small group modeled on the militant white supremacist 
group the order 
the order was a violent offshoot of the white supremacist aryan 
nations organization at hayden lake which is 30 miles northeast of 
spokane wash 
twentythree members of the original order were indicted in 
seattle on racketeering charges twelve pleaded guilty to various 
charges in the indictment while 10 others were convicted in december 
1985 a 23rd person is imprisoned in missouri on other convictions 
prosecutors in seattle alleged the order staged a string of 
crimes including bank and armored car robberies in late 1983 and 
1984 in a plot to overthrow the governemnt and establish an aryan 
homeland in the northwest 
the dorrs and hawleys were indicted by a federal grand jury 
earlier this year on counts of racketeering conspiracy 
counterfeiting bombing illegal possession of automatic weapons and 
malicious destruction of federal property 
they also face separate state charges in the bombings a trial is 
tentatively scheduled for early next year 
in all but one case us district judge harold ryan went along 
with a pleabargain agreement between the defendants and the us 
justice department the defendants all pleaded guilty 
prosecutors recommended up to 12 years for hawley but ryan cut 
that by a third 
i think there is hope for you ryan told hawley i feel 
that you have been a follower and you followed your way into a 
whole heap of trouble 
in september 1986 a series of explosions rocked the coeur 
dalene area in northern idaho one of the blasts damaged the home 
of a roman catholic priest active in human rights work and another 
damaged the federal building in coeur dalene there were no 
injuries 
dorr and hawley already are serving a fouryear sentence in an 
arizona prison on a federal counterfeiting conviction in washington 
state ryan gave them credit for time served since their arrests two 
years ago 
the sentences handed down wednesday were made concurrent with the 
previous convictions 
court officials said dorr 37 could be eligiible for 
consideration for parole in four to five years and hawley in two 
years 
mrs dorr probably will have to serve at least onethird of her 
eightyear sentence a defense attorney said

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen said wednesday evening the republicans had run a miserable 
campaign of distortions which michael dukakis did not address 
until after it hurt the democratic ticket 
bentsen appearing on the cbs evening news said he did not think 
george bush was a racist but he reiterated his opinion that the ads 
bush was sanctioning were 
i think what we have seen is a miserable campaign he said 
what hes allowing to be done is hypocrisy at work he 
said complaining that bush allows his advisers to distort the 
truth now he ought to root those things out 
bentsen cited the republicans use of ads showing pictures of 
willie horton a black massachusetts prisoner who escaped on 
furlough and was convicted of raping a white maryland woman in 
this instance youve seen how theyve used his photograph over and 
over and over again he said 
asked by cbs anchorman dan rather if the democrats were being 
opportunistic themselves bentsen said they were in fact slow to 
respond 
dan they started immediately after that democratic convention 
and frankly i thought they should have been answered then he 
said but my friend mike dukakis was incredulous he just didnt 
believe that sort of charges with the distortions could stick 
but they have and they have hurt and thats one of the reasons 
were in the kind of a race were in now 
rather asked bentsen how often he himself had met with jesse 
jackson and bentsen said they had participated recently in a joint 
satellite session with college students the two men were in 
separate cities for that event 
bentsen also said he planned to appear with jackson this week 
campaign officials said afterward the event was still tentative 
because of jacksons schedule 
on the stump in california where the cbs broadcast originated 
bentsen moved on from hitting at bushs campaign advertising and 
trained his sights again wednesday at bushs running mate dan 
quayle 
i think millions of americans would agree that dan quayle is 
not qualified to be president if he had to step into the job 
bentsen told a crowd at a riverside outdoor plaza 
bentsens appearance came hours before he was scheduled to appear 
on cbs as part of a strategy by the presidential campaign of michael 
dukakis to get as much television exposure as possible 
bentsen ridiculed the republican campaign for saying quayle would 
head up a bush administration war on drugs and lead the us space 
program 
as for quayles assertion that he would have a major influence on 
national defense policy bentsen said thats a frightening 
thought are you ready for that 
there was an enthusiastic response from the noontime crowd mike 
mccurry bentsens press secretary said quayle was a bigger issue 
in california than in most other states according to the campaigns 
poll 
we need to keep that issue in front of the voters mccurry 
said 
bentsen arrived in california after a swing through montana and 
the dakotas moving from states with the fewest electoral votes to 
the one with the most 
this is the big banana this is the one we have to win he 
said 
the rally complete with two high school bands cheerleaders and 
balloons was in part a warmup for an unprecedented television blitz 
by the campaign using bentsen 
the candidate was taping a fiveminute television commercial in 
los angeles wednesday which the democratic campaign plans to air 
nationwide on sunday night never has a presidential campaign bought 
commercial time to feature its vice presidential candidate 
the campaign has purchased a fiveminute block on the abc 
television network on sunday night 
bentsen will be talking about correcting the record stating 
the case the things hes been talking about so eloquently out on 
the stump said tad devine who coordinates bentsens campaign and 
is a top adviser for dukakis 
the democrats are counting on a major getoutthevote effort on 
election day to help carry key states and it is necessary to keep 
up enthusiasm in the face of polls showing the ticket trailing he 
said 
since bentsen was chosen he has been a consistent asset for 
dukakis and has proven himself a likeable candidate devine said 
since the debate against quayle and especially in the past few days 
this vice presidential part of the campaign is becoming much more 
salient he said 
in addition to taping the fiveminute spot and his appearance on 
the cbs evening news bentsen plans to make additional footage that 
could be used in commercials in the final week of the race a joint 
commercial spot with dukakis also was possible before election day 
devine said 
bentsens appearance with dan rather demonstrated to voters that 
he was capable of meeting with the press and public and his 
republican counterpart was not devine said 
lets face it the republicans wouldnt dream of putting dan 
quayle on a set with dan rather or anybody else he said

nicaraguas former minister of culture has been 
denied a visa to go on a speaking tour of universities around the 
united states the state department said wednesday 
frances jones a department spokeswoman said ernesto cardinales 
request for a visa was rejected under two sections of the 
immigration and naturalization act 
one section prohibits foreigners from receiving a visa if they 
had previously obtained one under false pretenses another bars 
anyone who has been associated with the communist party from 
obtaining a visa 
jones said she did not know specifically why cardinales request 
for a visa was turned down 
i dont have details on this and i dont know the 
particulars she said 
but she said the departments decision was unrelated to a 
proclamation signed tuesday by president reagan reagan said the 
united states will no longer grant entry visas to officials of 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government because such visits were 
detrimental to the interests of the united states 
the proclamation was partly in retaliation for new restrictions 
placed on us government officials in nicaragua last month 
relations between the two countries have been particularly strained 
since last july 11 when managua expelled the american ambassador 
and the united states retaliated 
the sandinista party newspaper barricada in its wednesday 
editions ran a last page story under the headline the us 
declares visa war 
the article charged that the denial of official visas was linked 
to an old plan by the central intelligence agency to try to 
isolate nicaragua 
cardinales original itinerary called for him to speak 
universities around the country in late october and early november 
last month ronald m mcallister associate dean of northeastern 
university in boston wrote sen john kerry dmass asking him to 
exert some pressure to encourage the issuance of cardinales 
visa so the nicaraguan could speak on nov 3 
mcallister said he was disturbed about the delay in the visa 
process mr cardinale is a wellknown figure who has been to this 
country before and for whom the process of a visa cannot be 
difficult timeconsuming or laborintensive the dean wrote

a heartlung transplant surgeon at the 
university of minnesota filed a defamation lawsuit against a 
newspapers unidentified sources who said he ordered an operation on 
a patient already considered dead 
the suit filed tuesday in hennepin county district court 
centers on a story that appeared in the star tribune aug 2 the 
story said the university was investigating an allegation that dr 
stuart jamieson ordered an associate to perform a bypass operation 
on a patient who was considered dead before the surgery began 
two days later in a front page note to readers the newspaper 
said it regretted having published the account because the sources 
for it did not have firsthand information 
the suit is designed to enable jamiesons attorneys to serve 
subpoenas and take sworn statements from people at the university of 
minnesota hospital who may be the sources or know who they are 
the surgeon on the case dr jolene kriett has said the aug 2 
report was wrong she said jamieson had not ordered the operation 
that it was not bypass surgery but the installation of a left 
ventricular assist device to help the patients failing heart and 
that the patient was alive when she operated 
thomas forsythe a spokesman for jamiesons lawyer terence fruth 
said tuesday that if attorneys learn the identity of the sources 
they would be named publicly as defendants in the suit 
the suit alleges that the sources have and continue to cause 
great damage to jamiesons reputation it asks that a court award 
him unspecified damages 
jamieson was suspended as chief of cardiovascular surgery and 
director of the universitys minnesota heart and lung institute on 
aug 3 and stripped of the two titles sept 19 dr david brown 
dean of the medical school said the decisions were based on 
interpersonal management failures jamieson still is authorized 
to perform surgery 
according to correspondence released with the suit the newspaper 
has turned down fruths request for the identity of the sources and 
the university has declined to join jamieson in asking the newspaper 
to release the names 
joel kramer executive editor of the star tribune said tuesday 
that the paper has no intention of revealing its sources as a 
matter of policy breaking a promise of confidentiality made to 
sources could shut off future sources of information he said

requiring amish people to display 
slowmoving vehicle signs on their horsedrawn buggies desecrates 
their religion an attorney argued wednesday in asking a judge to 
dismiss citations against 15 defendants 
the 15 were cited for failure to obey a state law requiring them 
to display the triangular warning signs on the rear of their 
buggies in the dark or fog the signs must be reflective orange 
and the amish shun bright colors 
attorney philip villaume of st paul told fillmore county 
district judge clement snyder that the amish recognize the states 
interest in safety on public roadways and are willing to use 
reflective tape and lanterns 
prosecutor matt opat has said the public safety issues outweigh 
any infringement the law may have on the defendants constitutional 
right of religious freedom 
lee zook 42 a professor at luther college in decorah iowa 
testified as an expert on the amish that slowmoving vehicle signs 
are an intrusion into their life this has nothing to do with 
being symbolic of being gods people which the amish believe they 
are zook said 
amish are opposed to bright colors because they draw attention to 
themselves zook said he said they put their trust in god and that 
they know traveling on the highway with a horse and buggy is 
somewhat dangerous 
the us supreme court has interpreted the first amendment to 
mean that sincerely held religious beliefs may not be infringed upon 
by the state unless the limitation is the least restrictive means to 
achieve a compelling state interest 
a ruling in the case is not expected for at least one month

airport but illinois two senators said it fell short of 
expectations 
the sixpage document sent to sen paul simon dill for relay 
to other lawmakers contained few details and set no timetable for 
implementating faa proposals 
among them were the hiring of an unspecified number of former 
ohare controllers to ease a staff shortage a pay incentive to 
increase the size of the tower staff and the expansion of 
controller facilities 
we have a big problem at ohare simon said what we wanted 
was an action plan what we got was a wish list 
sen alan dixon dill issued a statement calling the report 
inadequate 
this doesnt begin to address the problem dixon said 
dixon has proposed the rehiring of some of the controllers who 
were fired in a 1981 strike he said ohare needs 37 more 
controllers to bring its total to 72 but the faa report calls for 
the addition of only five 
dixon also said the faa report made no mention of limits on the 
number of flights going into and out of ohare 
the senate passed a resolution earlier this month instructing the 
faa to inform congress by oct 25 of its immediate and longterm 
goals to improve operations blamed for a surge of controller errors 
at ohare the nations busiest airport 
its controllers have had 30 such mistakes this year compared 
with 12 during all of 1987 and their previous record of 22 in 1986 
the faa said 
the report which was approved tuesday by transportation 
secretary james burnley and presented to simon a day after the 
senate deadline promised action to improve operations at ohare in 
five broad categories staffing and training facilities and 
equipment communications airspace and safety and efficiency on 
the ground 
to address a manpower shortage the faa cited two steps that 
officials already have decided to take 
five controllers are being relieved of training responsibilities 
and returned to regular traffic handling at the facility and the 
agency has begun assigning personnel with experience at ohare on a 
temporary basis until more fully trained controllers can be added to 
the staff 
it also said it hopes to adopt the pay incentive program and 
intends to establish a recruiting program as well as look into the 
possibility of sectorizing positions of operation so controllers 
need to be trained at fewer operating stations 
this review as others has identified numerous equipment and 
physical plant improvements that could be made in order to improve 
the efficient operation at chicago tower the report said many 
of these can be made in the short term 
for example the faa has leased a televisiontype weather monitor 
for the chicago tower while the agency waits for acquisition of 
similar units throughout the airtraffic control system 
the agency also cited several steps to make communications 
between pilots controllers airlines and technicians more efficient 
such as reassessing the distribution of handheld twoway radios 
and limiting radio conversations 
the recommendations essentially summarized 80 proposals the 
agency had made earlier to improve operations at ohare and broke no 
new ground said simons press secretary david carle 
not only was simon disappointed with the lack of a timetable 
but he felt the faa should have addressed other problems like 
flight delays carle said he said that demonstrates the agency 
still doesnt recognize that the status quo is unacceptable

the iraqi ambassador to the un said 
wednesday that if iraniraq peace talks break down over the 
shattalarab waterway iraq will reopen a new deepwater port just 
west of the shatt 
ambassador ismat kittani said the port at khor zouber was 
productive before war broke out in september 1980 and could be 
restored if iran is unwilling to guarantee free navigation on the 
shattalarab and agree to its being dredged 
he spoke with reporters at his home wednesday night just before 
returning to baghdad for consultations the peace talks resume in 
geneva on monday 
khor zouber is reached by turning west just before entering the 
shattalarab kittani said and entering the khor abdallah channel 
which empties into the persian gulf 
the shatt was iraqs main outlet to the gulf before the war but 
has been blocked by sunken ships unexploded ordnance and silt that 
has accumulated since the war began in september 1980 
asked if iraq wanted to develop an alternative deepwater port 
kittani replied well have to if the iranians wont agree to 
begin the dredging and reopening of the shatt known to iran as the 
arvand river 
we certainly can do without basra if necessary said kittani 
basra iraqs major port city on the shatt was heavily shelled in 
the war 
the envoy noted that before the war at least 85 percent of 
irans imports came to iran through the shatt to khorramshar on 
the east bank of the passage 
kittani said regarding rights to the shatt each is on his side 
of the passage we will decide the sovereignty of running water 
later in the peace talks 
whatever agreement is signed on the shatt both countries will 
be able to use it with specific rights to be worked out said 
kittani 
iran insists the 1975 algiers treaty which defines their border 
as running down the middle of the shatt must be maintained 
president saddam hussein of iraq rejected the treaty in 1980 
iraq distrusts irans commitment to a true peace settlement and 
diplomats have said it appears iraq may want to gain sovereignty 
over the entire shatt to guarantee its freedom of navigation

hustler magazine publisher larry flynt offered 
a hitman 1 million to kill playboy magazine founder hugh hefner 
frank sinatra publisher walter annenberg and penthouse publisher 
bob guccione authorities said wednesday 
the 1 million never was paid however and the purported hitman 
mitchel l werbell died of a heart attack in december 1983 about a 
month after he allegedly accepted the check from flynt sheriffs 
capt robert grimm said at a news conference 
grimm identified targets of the alleged plot as hefner sinatra 
and guccione he declined to name a fourth person targeted but 
knbctv news reported that person was annenberg 
larry flynt one evening called an individual by the name of 
werbell to his home and allegedly offered him 1 million if he would 
arrange for the death of these four individuals sheriff sherman 
block told knbc 
werbell called himself an advisor to the green berets in vietnam 
and a retired general of the royal free afghan army according to 
promotional material from his counterterrorism firm sionics inc 
released by the sheriffs department 
he did in fact give werbell a 1 million check which 
immediately upon leaving we were told that flynts business 
manager stopped payment on that check so it never was negotiated 
the sheriff of los angeles county said in the broadcast interview 
the station displayed a photocopy of a 1 million check allegedly 
signed by flynt made out to werbell 
grimm said information about the alleged plot turned up recently 
in the investigation the 1983 murderforhire slaying of new york 
theater producer roy radin whom authorities said was embroiled in a 
soured finance deal for the movie the cotton club 
grimm said sheriffs investigators have not interviewed flynt and 
have not presented a case to the district attorneys office he 
declined to elaborate and said the sheriff spoke about the purported 
plot because he was approached by the news media and decided to 
answer questions about it 
in 1983 flynt claimed to have knowledge of videotapes 
purportedly showing vicki morgan mistress of the late diners club 
founder alfred bloomingdales engaged in sexual antics with reagan 
administration officials 
the tapes were never produced or proven to exist 
another time that year flynt threatened to parachute over the 
pacific ocean at the site where korean air lines flight 007 was shot 
down by a soviet interceptor 
at the time flynt was heavily sedated with powerful drugs to 
assuage pain from wounds that left him paralyzed after an 
assassination attempt in 1978 during an obscenity trial in georgia 
block told knbc that flynt could possibly be prosecuted for 
soliciting a murder however no charges have been filed 
bill farley director of communications for playboy said the 
plot occurred in november 1983 and came to light in the course of an 
investigation into another matter 
farley said his information came from the sheriffs department 
but he did not know what the other matter was 
susan reynolds publicist for frank sinatra said the entertainer 
was en route to reno nev for performances and she wasnt able to 
contact him she said she would leave a message at the hotel asking 
him to call 
a telephone call placed to penthouse magazine headquarters in new 
york was answered by a security guard who said no one representing 
the magazine was available for comment 
a telephone call placed to annenbergs palm springs home was 
answered by a woman who said he was in residence on the east coast 
and wouldnt be immediately available for comment 
she declined to disclose her relationship to annenberg or what 
city he was living in she took a message and said she would forward 
it to annenberg after hours calls made to annenbergs triangle 
publications in radnor pa went unanswered 
block said he considered the matter serious ive been led to 
believe that larry flynt has a propensity to try to harm people he 
sees as his enemies whether business arrangements or whatever 
block said 
a receptionist at flynts office didnt know where the publisher 
and said she was unaware of the report on the alleged murder plot 
although the broadcast report suggested a publishing rivalry 
between the mens magazine publishers farley said the other names 
suggested that was not the case and that the motivation is unknown 
why the authorities chose to release hugh hefners name and not 
anybody elses is a mystery to me farley said

the vice president of peru questioned the 
safety of the state airline on wednesday and urged that it be 
reorganized a day after 12 people died in the fiery crash of an 
aeroperu jetliner 
a swiss priest and four other europeans were among those killed 
fiftyseven people survived many with serious injuries when the 
twinjet fokker28 crashed immediately after taking off from the 
airport in juliaca more than 12000 feet above sea level in the 
andes mountains 
aeroperu said six americans and nine other foreigners were among 
44 people with significant injuries the other survivors received 
minor bruises 
the us embassy said aeroperu earlier mistakenly identified one 
of the dead as an american the british embassy said the man 
douglas harris was a 53yearold briton living in the united states 
areoperu said a passenger earlier listed as unaccounted for was a 
peruvian who survived without major injuries 
the company also issued a communique late wednesday responding 
to mounting criticism since the crash the plane was in proper 
operating condition fulfilling strictly the maintenance regulations 
stipulated by the manufacturer the communique said 
however vice president luis alberto sanchez said in a radio 
interview aeroperu needed and still needs substantial reform new 
planes are needed but above all they must be functioning in a 
constant state of repair the pilots association of aeroperu had 
charged that the airlines fleet of 10 planes was in poor shape 
because of a shortage of spare parts and lack of maintenance 
the union struck briefly two months ago over the issue 
aeroperu said the foreigners aboard the dutchmade craft when it 
crashed were mainly tourists returning from a visit to nearby lake 
titicaca flight 771 was bound for lima 540 miles to the northwest 
with a stop in arequipa 
survivors and witnesses on the ground said an explosion rocked 
the plane seconds after takeoff the plane crashed by the cabanillas 
river a mile from the airport 
many victims died from burns suffered after the plane split in 
three pieces on impact and the tail section burst into flames 
officials said 
transportation minister camilo carrillo said the pilot averted a 
greater disaster by steering the jet toward a sandy flood plain 
which softened the impact 
officials gave no cause for the accident they said an 
investigation was under way 
besides harris aeroperu identified the european dead as the rev 
kurt lenz a roman catholic priest from switzerland who worked near 
juliaca herbert and ingeborg pfiller a married couple from france 
and bruno baldazari of italy 
it listed six americans three spaniards two italians two 
french one briton and one brazilian among the injured 
prior to tuesdays crash the last major air accident here 
occurred dec 9 when a twinengine navy fokker f27 crashed off 
limas pacific coast killing 44 people including nearly the entire 
squad of perus no 1 soccer team alianza lima

an 8yearold girl allegedly beaten to death 
at an oregon farm while other children watched and counted the blows 
was laid to rest wednesday with a plea from her uncle to learn to 
love another better 
dayna lorea broussard died oct 14 at the home used by ecclesia 
athletic association a group founded by her father eldridge 
broussard jr purportedly to train ghetto youngsters to be 
worldclass athletes and entertainers 
the girl was beaten and whipped by members of the group 
authorities alleged four people were charged with manslaughter 
broussard was not among the 150 family members and friends who 
filled the angelus funeral home where the little girl lay in an 
open pink casket 
little dayna is in the arms of jesus now said the rev 
charles bereal pastor of calvary bible church of compton shes 
safe amen 
were the ones who are left behind he said were the ones 
who are still struggling 
in his eulogy bereal asked mourners to trust in god with the 
simplicity of a child adults have a tendency to be proud 
bereal said a child will willingly go saying i trust you i 
humble myself to you 
the girls uncle henry webb told mourners this is an 
experience that weve never experienced before through this 
experience may we learn to love one another better and to experience 
life more 
the girls cousin michael bereal who acted as a pallbearer 
said most members of the family were deeply troubled by broussards 
actions 
its a cult said bereal i hope the authorities break all 
that stuff up its all el broussard hes the whole problem 
meanwhile in los angeles a misdemeanor complaint alleging child 
endangerment and inflicting illegal corporal punishment was filed 
wednesday against alvin elvis broussard the 25yearold brother of 
eldridge broussard jr 
the complaint stemmed from a police visit to the watts christian 
center on oct 16 prompted by news reports of daynas death in 
oregon said mike qualls a spokesman for city attorney james k 
hahn 
while the officers were at the center they noticed that a 
10yearold boy had bruises on his head and chest hahn said in a 
prepared statement they questioned him about his injuries and he 
told them alvin broussard had struck him with a rubber hose and a 
closed fist 
alvin broussard initially was booked for investigation of felony 
child endangerment but the case subsequently was referred to hahns 
office for misdemeanor prosecution said deputy city attorney alice 
hand 
in oregon authorities said the children who were kept in a 
sparsely furnished fourbedroom farmhouse were subjected to 
ritualistic beatings of up to 800 strokes with a paddle or 
electrical cord 
in some cases including the beating death of dayna children 
were forced to watch and keep count authorities said the beatings 
were intended to enhance athletic performance not to punish 
misbehavior authorities have said 
the children mostly from the impoverished watts section of los 
angeles were kept in the farmhouse near sandy about 30 miles 
southeast of portland 
the state of oregon has taken 53 children into protective custody 
from the farm two other children involved in the group are in 
custody in los angeles 
eldridge broussard jr has denied that the children were beaten 
or abused saying they were only spanked 
the four suspects in the girls death all of whom have pleaded 
innocent to firstdegree manslaughter charges remained in custody 
wednesday after defense lawyers asked that scheduled release 
hearings be delayed a defense lawyer said the attorneys havent had 
enough time to review investigative reports in the case

a mexican drug trafficker convicted in the 
torturemurder of a us drug agent was sentenced wednesday to life 
in prison plus 240 years by a judge who said the evidence was 
conclusive 
rene verdugo urquidez 36 who admitted to running a major 
marijuana trafficking organization arose to protest his innocence 
in court before he was sentenced 
he slumped slightly as us district judge edward rafeedie 
announced the concurrent sentences which will make verdugo 
ineligible for parole for at least 60 years 
earlier rafeedie sentenced a codefendant jesus felix 
gutierrez to 10 years in prison following his conviction as an 
accessory after the fact 
felix 38 was convicted of helping mexican drug lord rafael caro 
quintero escape to costa rica following the 1985 torturemurder of 
enrique camarena a us drug enforcement administration agent 
camarena had been investigating caros drug smuggling empire in 
mexico when he was kidnapped outside the us consulate in 
guadalajara on feb 7 1985 
camarenas battered body was found along with the body of his 
pilot in a shallow grave at a remote ranch 65 miles southeast of 
guadalajara on march 5 1985 
verdugo declared through an interpreter you are judging an 
innocent person thats all i have to say 
his attorney michael pancer also argued passionately before 
sentencing that the jury verdict was wrong 
this is the most difficult moment ive had in court in 20 
years the attorney said i know its important for counsel to 
accept the verdict but your honor i cant do that 
the verdict was not correct because mr verdugo is innocent of 
wrongdoing in this case pancer said 
the prosecutor assistant us attorney jimmy gurule told the 
judge that the jury was right and he urged the judge to send a 
powerful message to drug traffickers by imposing a stiff sentence 
verdugo was typical of a band of narcoterrorists who are 
attacking the foundation and fabric of society gurule said 
rafeedie rejected the prosecutors request for a 900year 
sentence and instead imposed four consecutive 60year terms on four 
of the counts and a single life imprisonment sentence on another 
charge 
the fact of the matter is the evidence is conclusive and 
undisputed rafeedie said that on the date that the murder and 
torture was taking place that verdugo was at that house 
he added there is enough here on the part of the jury to find 
participation on the part of mr verdugo 
earlier rafeedie ordered that felix serve his 10year sentence 
after his current 15year term for marijuana trafficking 
felixs lawyer barry tarlow had argued that his clients role 
was minor and that he was far less important in the overall scheme 
of camarenas murder than two codefendants also convicted in the 
camarena case 
the third defendant raul lopez alvarez is to be sentenced 
friday

swastikas and the words no remorse 
were discovered wednesday painted on a prominent holocaust memorial 
containing ashes of jews who died in the auschwitz concentration 
camp 
the desecration of the monument with antisemitic graffiti 
stunned members of the jewish community who said the words written 
on the 11yearold memorial demonstrated that whoever committed the 
vandalism fully understood the significance of the site 
i was absolutely distraught it was as if the seas of nazism 
were once again flourishing said arthur spiegel executive vice 
president of the jewish federation of new haven 
the vandalism was the first incident of desecration to the 
memorial since someone tried to burn down six yew bushes at the site 
10 years ago spiegel said 
the memorial is located in a small park situated along a major 
city artery spiegel summoned police to the site after being alerted 
early wednesday morning of the vandalism 
two swastikas were spraypainted on the monuments brass plaques 
and the words no remorse and white power were written on the 
concrete base spiegel said 
the brass monument depicts the barbed wire fences of the nazi 
concentration camps a statement dedicating the memorial to the six 
million jews who died in the holocaust is written in english 
yiddish and hebrew 
ashes recovered from the nazi concentration camp in auschwitz 
poland were reinterred in the base of the memorial and local 
holocaust survivors who have no other cemetery to go to visit it 
to say prayers for family members and friends who perished in the 
war spiegel said 
spiegel said the use of the slogan no remorse indicated to 
him that an adult was responsible for the desecration youngsters 
dont use the word remorse that is not in a childs vocabulary 
he said 
city police major thomas muller said an investigation was 
continuing and that police could not yet say whether the act was 
the work of a youngster or an adult 
the swastikas and slogans were all removed with the only lasting 
damage occurring to the brass plates spiegel said 
the memorial designed by a christian architect who accepted no 
payment for his services was erected in 1977 
plaques recognizing the role of righteous gentiles who helped 
jews during the war and servicemen who fought the nazis were added 
to the memorial site 
the monument was the first of its kind in the country built 
jointly by a municipality and a jewish organization he said 
about 300 of the estimated 25000 jews living in the new haven 
area are holocaust survivors according to the jewish federation

delivered by caesarean section should be encouraged to have later 
children by normal vaginal birth 
dr mary jo osullivan a member of an acog panel that developed

by caesarean section should be encouraged to attempt labor in her 
current pregnancy instead of routinely undergoing a second

csection always a csection tradition that has guided obstetric 
practice since 1916

the turnout in the presidential election is 
expected to be one of the lowest this century continuing a trend of 
declining voter participation in a nation that prides itself as a 
beacon of western democracy say political analysts 
public interest groups are warning that only 50 percent or less 
of the eligible voters will go to the polls on nov 8 about the 
same as the record low 49 percent turnout in the 1924 presidential 
election 
the declining turnout down from a record high 79 percent in 
1896 puts the united states at the bottom of the voter 
participation list in the worlds democratic systems 
belgium heads the average voter participation list with 95 
percent while the united states ranks last with 53 percent and 
ireland second to last at 62 percent according to figures compiled 
by frances fox piven and richard cloward in their book why

the staggering new corporate debt burdens 
proposed in the wave of multibilliondollar leveraged buyout bids 
could force companies to make big layoffs and reduce employee 
benefits to cover debt payments critics say 
the impact of these buyouts which rely largely on borrowed 
funds also could multiply if the us economy enters a recession 
and the companies are unable to generate the cash flow or asset 
sales needed to raise money for their debt payments according to 
labor economists and consultants 
in one of the latest developments the buyout firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co has offered to pay 2028 billion most of 
which represents borrowed money rather than equity to acquire food 
and tobacco giant rjr nabisco inc 
warnings about the leveraged buyout wave come as many us 
companies already are aggressively cutting costs to survive in an 
increasingly competitive world economy

dan lauria believes that one reason he works 
so much as an actor is that few people in the film business look at 
old movies 
he plays the overworked father on abcs the wonder years and 
has had recurring roles on two other series he was in the movie 
stakeout and played bernadette peters boyfriend in the tv movie 
david this saturday he plays the veteran police sergeant in 
cop killer the first installment of the remake of the anthology 
series police story on abc 
people dont watch the old movies said lauria nobody 
knows richard conte i go in for a part and do my richard conte or 
van heflin nobody knows im stealing i steal from the best and i 
dont feel bad about it 
lauria appears with ken olin and patricia wettig the 
husbandandwife stars of abcs thirtysomething in the premiere 
episode of police story 
abc revived police story last summer during the writers 
strike when it appeared the networks would not have new shows ready 
for the fall season the series created by author joseph wambaugh 
ran on nbc from 197377 laurias role was originally played by 
cameron mitchell 
im the veteran police sergeant said lauria kenny olin is 
the young stud cop olins partner is taken hostage during a traffic 
stop theyre bank robbers and it turns into a firefight his 
partner is killed and kenny kills a bank robber and gets a medal 
even though he did everything by the book kenny goes through a 
psychological change 
i loved working with kenny he didnt walk through it we 
talked over the characters which is rare for television this is 
more of a drama about what happens to this man than an action 
picture 
lauria grew up watching old movies and still watches them 
regularly from his large collection of tapes his ambition is to 
work with james stewart 
i grew up in lindenhurst ny and my aunt lived with us when 
i was young he said i was a big jock in school when i got 
home from practice id eat dinner and my aunt would send me straight 
to bed then shed wake me in the middle of the night shed say 
james cagney or james stewart or tyrone power id get up 
and watch the most wonderful movies 
when the networks decided to revive some old shows during the 
writers strike i dont know why they went back to the 1970s they 
should have gone back to the 1950s and redone those great live 
dramas i can think of a lot of shows that stand up pretty well 
today 
lauria began acting at southern connecticut university which he 
attended on a football scholarship as a captain in the marine 
corps he served briefly in vietnam and at quantico va where he 
shared an office with oliver north he also received a masters 
degree from yale and a degree in playwriting from the university of 
connecticut 
im the adviser on the wonder years since it takes place in 
1968 he said the producers neal marlens and carol black were 
only 12 at the time so if a question comes up they look at me 
like the old guard the real stars of this show are the scripts 
they are so wonderful 
i didnt want to do the part at first they offered me more 
money i said it wasnt the money then carol cried i said wait 
a producer who cries the reason i said no was that i figured it 
would last for eight years i didnt want to be locked up that 
long 
lauria has a recurring role on abcs hooperman as barbara 
bossons husband until its cancellation he played a detective on 
cbs cagney amp lacey he worked in the precinct where mary beth 
lacey lived and was the one who arrested her when she joined a

in a darkened classroom a slide 
projector beams a photograph of a bend in the st marys river where 
crosscurrents have fooled some of the most experienced great lakes 
freighter pilots 
the students studying the narrow river stretch make mental notes 
for the day they will steer a hulking 700foot lake freighter 
through the same winding passage 
for cadets at the great lakes maritime academy such training in 
current navigational technology is combined with the guidance of 
experienced sailors 
its much better training than you can get on a ship because we 
can simulate nearcollisions or running aground said rear adm 
james f mcnulty superintendent of the academy which is part of 
northwestern michigan college 
graduates of the threeyear deck officer program can be licensed 
to pilot commercial vessels starting at 18000 to 20000 a year 
does the reality of life on the high seas match the adventure and 
glamor of great lakes folklore 
i wouldnt recommend it for anyone who doesnt like getting 
dirty or who needs to see a movie every night or who likes to run 
out to the store said graduate candace peterson 30 of two 
harbors minn one of few women working on the us fleet on the 
great lakes 
theres no glamour in it at all but its wonderful going home 
knowing youve made a good wage and have choices of what to do with 
your money said peterson third assistant engineer on the usx 
corps fleet she expects to make 30000 to 40000 this shipping 
season 
new graduates typically work as relief help for vacationing 
sailors or those who take advantage of their 30 days shore leave for 
each 90 days worked mcnulty said 
in his first job after graduating in 1985 john basile piloted a 
tour boat around escanaba mich for 8 an hour the following two 
years he worked as a fillin deck hand making 20000 to 25000 
each year 
ive loved the water all my life and wanted to have something 
to do with it said basile who now sails lake freighters with 
inland lakes management of alpena i wanted to make a lot of money 
and i didnt want to spend a lot of time in college 
mcnulty has been speaking to the elks optimists and kiwanis 
clubs trying to recruit students from cleveland milwaukee and 
throughout michigan the task isnt easy 
in the early 1980s the opportunities for graduates were not 
good and the news was widespread he said 
great lakes shipping slumped in the early 1980s due mostly to a 
slipping demand for steel the 1987 season was brisk and through 
august of this year the most recent figures available shipments of 
iron ore coal and stone were up 135 percent over the same 
eightmonth period last year said glenn nekvasil spokesman for the 
lake carriers association 
by 1991 at least 71 pilots and 69 engineers will be needed by 
the 14 shipping companies that comprise the lake carriers 
association to fill vacancies created by retirement the 
clevelandbased association says 
mcnulty an ebullient 58yearold irishman who earned the rank of 
rear admiral in the us navy before retiring became director of 
the academy in 1984 
enrollment is 57 students this year its high was 210 in 1981 
among the schools benefactors is canadian balladeer gordon 
lightfoot who underwrites a 5000 annual scholarship his donation 
came after one of the schools cadets died in the sinking of the 
edmund fitzgerald on lake superior in november 1975 the subject of 
a hit song by lightfoot 
the academy is one of six regional staterun facilities in the 
united states it is considered quasimilitary but except for 
requiring cadets to wear khakicolored pants and shirts and black 
shoes military rules are absent mcnulty said 
the school offers two programs one trains cadets to become deck 
officers who can eventually pilot the great lakes freighters that 
primarily haul iron ore stone and coal the second program trains 
cadets to maintain equipment on the commercial vessels 
subjects include naval science nautical rules ship construction 
and ship stability and ship handling both programs lead to an 
associate of applied science degree 
the threeyear programs include nine months of training on a 
commercial freighter thats when many students learn whether life 
on the seas is for them 
a lot of youngsters decide they want to become sailors after 
reading some romantic novel mcnulty said its not all like 
that it can be very dull 
of each 50 students who enroll in the program mcnulty said about 
15 drop out 
weve lost a couple good ones to love mcnulty said they 
get back and their girl says if this is the way its going to be 
get yourself another girl to be a sailors wife it takes a 
special kind of gal

a debate is raging in the financial world these 
days over whether home prices might be headed for the same kind of 
crash that hit the stock market a year ago 
without question this is a touchy subject as a group american 
individuals and families have an enormous stake in residential real 
estate much greater than they have ever had in stocks 
of course the two markets and the assets traded in them differ 
in many significant ways housing fulfills a basic human need while 
stocks are a purely financial proposition 
still no free market is immune to a decline regardless of what 
commodity is traded in it 
the argument got under way in earnest two months ago when 
barrons magazine published an article on the coming collapse in 
home prices citing warnings from analysts at the respected 
investment firm of comstock partners 
since that story appeared there has been something of a rush by 
other analysts to rebut it 
contrary to the general impression said edward yardeni 
economist at prudentialbache securities the amount of mortgage 
debt owed by american households is surprisingly low especially 
relative to the value of their homes 
that would seem to minimize the danger of widespread defaults and 
forced home sales at sacrifice prices even in the age of the 
adjustablerate mortgage and the home equity loan 
but more than debt the question that troubles some observers is 
simply whether home prices are too high they have been rising 
faster than the consumer price index for some 25 years now and that 
presumably cannot continue indefinitely 
one way to gauge the market is affordability the level of home 
prices measured against peoples ability to make the down payments 
and qualify for the mortgages necessary to sustain those prices 
gray cardiff publisher of the investment advisory letter sound 
advice calculates an affordability ratio that compares the median 
family income for a hypothetical household that earns more than 
half the population and less than the other half with the 
qualification income necessary to pay the median price for 
existing houses 
for the first half of this year by cardiffs reckoning it took 
an income of 27290 to pay the median national home price of 
88283 
since the actual median family income was 31341 he says the 
national affordability ratio was a positive 115 
when the ratio is above 10 houses are affordable and the 
market can be expected to remain strong cardiff declares 
but the national picture is by no means uniform he adds 
affordability ratios vary drastically from region to region and from 
one metropolitan area to another 
houston after suffering through the energy recession of the past 
several years has an extremely high affordability ratio of 188 
by contrast on the east and west coasts new york boston los 
angeles and san francisco all have affordability ratios of less than 
1 an indication that homes have become dangerously 
unaffordable by cardiffs reasoning 
to some cardiffs analysis may seem a bit simplistic the 
factors that influence home prices from place to place are many and 
complex 
in any case however cardiff makes an important point the 
national real estate market is far from homogeneous 
true a nationwide economic slump or worldwide financial crisis 
would stand to depress home prices everywhere but in the experience 
of the 1980s economic trends have been anything but uniform 
yardeni concluded we anticipate rolling recessions which 
will depress different sections of the country at different times 
home prices could fall in those regions of the country that are 
experiencing a recession but prices should continue to rise in 
cities and suburbs that remain prosperous

a few days after rjr nabisco inc disclosed its 
top executives were considering offering shareholders 75 a share 
for the company a competing offer of 90 a share came from another 
group 
the first offer from the insiders would have totaled 176 
billion the second from kohlberg kravis roberts amp co was for 3 
billion more an amount more than the assets of companies such as 
wang laboratories or inland steel 
the huge difference brings up many questions including the 
fundamental question of how value is determined but even this is 
not as intriguing as another which is what is the responsibility 
of corporate officers 
on an even larger scale questions are arising about what some 
critics see as a nomans land of regulation that is allowing some 
of americas biggest companies to disappear with unusually huge 
benefits to a relative few 
the insider question while perhaps not the most important is 
increasingly meaningful in light of the concern about trading 
activities of those who have access to inside information ie 
information not available to the public 
nobody for example is more privy than those who run companies 
corporate officers know meaningful things not available to the 
public its employees its shareholders and competitors for 
ownership 
they know which parts of the company are likely to do best not 
just the divisions but the plants within the divisions and the 
departments too 
they know which parts must be sold which kept which developed 
into new profit centers they are aware of products not yet on 
stream of personnel to be promoted of opportunities to be seized 
knowing all this however does not necessarily put them in a 
position to make the best offer to the companys shareholders in a 
leveraged buyout it might in fact make it even more difficult to 
present the best offer 
by its nature that is a leveraged buyout is among other things 
an attempt by buyers to get the maximum leverage to obtain the 
utmost for the least and even to benefit personally in a way more 
profitable than any other available 
confronted with a buyout situation does the corporate officer 
look out for the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
or of himself does a management seeking to buy the company work to 
boost the company or does it wait until the deal is complete thus 
making it a better deal for them 
buying out companies has become a prop under the current level of 
stock market prices a rage that accounts for much of the daily 
activity researchers now study candidates for buyout rather than a 
companys sales and earnings speculators buy not for earnings 
prospects but in anticipation of an offer 
the main defense of buyouts is that they maximize shareholder 
investments and get rid of complacent management but there are 
other sides to that story too 
that they immediately raise trading prices can hardly be denied 
but often the company is headed for dismemberment and sale meaning 
the high per share price is a onetime thing there are no further 
increases dividends may cease 
at the same time many of these shareholders appear to benefit 
more than they really do longterm investors for instance have no 
choice but to sell thus incurring capital gains taxes that 
otherwise would have been deferred 
most observers also concede that complacent management is at 
least put back on its toes but sometimes a company is vulnerable 
at least temporarily not because of poor management but because it 
is gearing up for the longer term 
critics of buyouts say that other aspects of the phenomenon are 
not handled any better by regulators 
bondholders can be devastated by sharp declines in value equity 
is often replaced by lowgrade debt workers may lose jobs 
communities may lose taxes the economy might lose some of its 
strongest international competitors 
as the takeover battle rages the questions mount is all this 
the reconstruction of corporate america as sometimes is said or 
might it be its dismemberment

the long 1988 campaign often more negative than enlightening is 
racing to a close with george bush and michael dukakis offering 
competing visions of a better america and thousands of other 
candidates wary of fallout from the presidential race 
more than 90 million americans will go to the polls on nov 8 to 
select a successor to ronald reagan choose onethird of the senate 
and the entire house 
twelve states will elect governors thousands of other races for 
state and local offices as well as scores of initiatives will be on 
ballots throughout the country 
for the democrats the prospects were for continued sway over 
congress their senate majority only a longshot risk their house 
control secure democrats also were optimistic about adding up to 
four governors to their ranks 
but in election days biggest contest dukakis was an underdog in 
his bid to recapture the white house for the democrats after two 
ronald reagan landslides 
republican bush who found a political as well as moral virtue in 
loyalty to his chief was bidding to become the first sitting vice 
president since martin van buren in 1836 to win election to the 
presidency 
while polls gave bush the edge going into the final week they 
also profiled an electorate unhappy with the choice and the negative 
tone of the campaign 
i think theres a kind of reluctance for people to commit 
themselves to one of two people neither of whom they like said 
ia lewis chief of polling for the los angeles times 
neither of these guys seems to attract the kind of commitment 
that some other presidential candidates have had said larry 
hugick of the gallup organization 
those assessments suggested to dukakis strategists an opportunity 
for a lastminute shift in sentiment the massachusetts governor was 
closing out his campaign with a strong populist message combined 
with counterattacks against bush commercials portraying him as soft 
on crime and defense 
dukakis portrayed bush as the candidate of the rich who would 
benefit from his own proposal for a cut in capital gains taxes and 
said the republican nominee was running a campaign based on 
distortions and distractions and outright lies why because he 
cant win an election where the real issues are discussed 
bush countered there are signs showing in the opposition camp 
of desperation using ads that accuse us of lies 
the competing candidates crossed paths regularly in the big 
states crucial to their hopes of gaining the 270 electoral votes 
needed for election voters in california new york illinois ohio 
michigan and pennsylvania had the best chance of seeing one or both 
of the candidates in person 
for most americans the best view was 30second glimpses on their 
television sets 
both candidates who began their fall campaigns with 461 
million in federal funds were expected to buy 30 minutes of network 
time for electioneve appeals to voters 
watching the presidential campaign with uncommon interest were 
other candidates particularly democrats with vivid memories of the 
1980 reagan landslide in which republicans picked up 12 senate seats 
to gain control of the body for the first time in a quarter century 
democrats regained a senate majority in 1986 and entered the 
current campaign with a 5446 edge 
of the 33 senate seats contested this year 18 are held by 
democrats and 15 by republicans six incumbents three in each 
party did not run for reelection 
democrat charles robb appeared certain to pick up the open 
republican seat in virginia where he is a prohibitive favorite over 
republican maurice dawkins 
the race for another gop open seat in washington was considered a 
tossup between former republican sen slade gorton and democratic 
rep mike lowry 
republicans were optimistic about their chances to win open 
democratic seats in mississippi and florida 
two republican incumbents were on the highly endangered list 
chic hecht of nevada and david karnes of nebraska 
among democrats the incumbents with the strongest challenges 
were frank lautenberg of new jersey and howard metzenbaum of ohio 
with good breaks a strong topoftheticket effort which were 
getting and with general good luck we could do it said 
republican senate campaign committee spokesman tom mason when asked 
whether the gop can win the seats they need five if there is a 
democratic vice president four if there is a republican to claim 
control of the senate 
in the house strategists in both parties were predicting minimal 
shifts from the current lineup of 255 democrats and 177 republicans 
three seats are vacant 
no one was predicting a shift of more than five seats for either 
party 
in races for governor the democrats appeared to have a good 
chance to enlarge their current 2723 edge nationwide 
the most endangered incumbents were republicans edward diprete of 
rhode island norman bangerter of utah and arch moore of west 
virginia in addition democrat evan bayh was favored in the race to 
succeed republican gov robert d orr of indiana who was ineligible 
for another term 
while candidates often hoped for a boost from presidential race 
coattails that was usually an elusive advantage 
the 1980 reagan landslide was credited with helping many 
republican candidates but when he carried 49 states in 1984 his 
party lost two senate seats

for bush and dukakis the 1988 campaign was a political roller 
coaster 
the vice president started out facing demands that he separate 
himself from reagan and establish his own identity 
economic hard times in the midwest and the irancontra scandal 
were considered formidable obstacles in bushs path to the white 
house 
the first major test in the fight for the republican presidential 
nomination the iowa precinct caucuses bore that out when bush 
finished an embarrassing third behind senate gop leader bob dole and 
television evangelist pat robertson 
but a funny thing happened on the way to bushs political 
funeral he bounced back to win the new hampshire primary after 
suffering two more midwest defeats in south dakota and minnesota 
bush effectively closed out the gop race on super tuesday when he 
won all 16 primaries most of them in the south 
dukakis had a longer road he finished a respectable third in 
iowa and then won new hampshire and established his frontrunner 
status on super tuesday but poor showings in illinois and michigan 
kept the race open 
in the spring dukakis found his stride and reeled off a series 
of primary victories that narrowed the field to himself and jesse 
jackson week after week dukakis beat jackson and also saw national 
polls giving him a strong lead over bush 
by the end of the democratic national convention in july polls 
said dukakis was favored over bush by a margin of up to 17 points 
his choice of texas sen lloyd bentsen as a running mate was 
widely applauded and was regarded as a direct challenge to bush in 
his adopted home state the third biggest electoral prize 
a month later it was bushs turn in contrast to dukakis choice 
of bentsen the bush selection of sen dan quayle of indiana was 
widely criticized 
the rival candidates used almost identical words to state their 
overall goal 
i seek the presidency to build a better america its that 
simple said bush 
i want to be president not because its the next rung on the 
ladder but because its the way to act on my values and build the 
best america said dukakis 
but the campaign rhetoric didnt remain that lofty 
the democratic nominee was strangely silent during the summer 
while the bush campaign unleashed a strong campaign focusing on 
dukakis veto of legislation requiring recitation of the pledge of 
allegiance his states prison furlough program and pollution in 
boston harbor 
not until the final weeks of the campaign when polls had shifted 
from the impressive dukakis lead to a steady margin for bush did 
the democratic nominee start striking back 
not only did dukakis finally respond to the bush attacks but he 
also began sounding a new and sharper populist message 
george bush wants to help the people who already have it 
made he told large enthusiastic crowds i want to help every 
american family make it 
bush was closing out his campaign by staying with the pattern 
that had worked so well to date days that usually began with an 
issues speech and by afternoon shifted to standard stump rhetoric 
including the attacks on dukakis as soft on crime and defense and as 
an unrepentant liberal

rep richard h stallings sat nervously on the 
house floor as the seemingly interminable 100th congress lurched 
toward adjournment more than 2000 miles from his idaho 
congressional district 
stallings a twoterm democrat is one of about 40 
representatives who face tough reelection fights and the 
latenight house sessions forced him to cancel a series of campaign 
appearances nothing replaces the individual contact with the 
constituents he said 
activists from both parties expect that when the smoke clears 
many of those struggling incumbents about evenly divided between 
both parties will be victorious and if history repeats itself 
nearly all of the 408 members of the house seeking reelection will 
be there when the 101st congress convenes in january 
in 1986 385 of the 393 house incumbents seeking reelection 98 
percent were victorious of the winners nearly nine out of every 
10 captured at least 60 percent of the major party vote considered 
a landslide margin 
accountability to voters may be a vestigal memory says 
michael waldman legislative director of congress watch a frequent 
critic of congressional practices members fear popular 
discontent but they really neednt be because it rarely results in 
their defeat 
presidential elections can affect congressional races but house 
incumbents from the party that loses the white house rarely suffer 
massive losses when president reagan swamped walter mondale by 
taking 49 states in 1984 republicans picked up only 14 seats in the 
house the republicans gained 34 house seats on reagans coattails 
in 1980 yet jimmy carter brought in only one additional house 
democrat in 1976 
even with republican presidential nominee george bush showing a 
steady lead over democratic rival michael dukakis in the polls no 
one expects the democrats 255177 advantage in the house there 
are three vacancies to be seriously diminished 
spokeswoman peggy connolly of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee says the overall change in the parties numbers 
in the chamber will probably be two to five seats in either 
direction steven lotterer national republican congressional 
committee spokesman said he expects the gop to gain some seats but 
adds no ones looking to take over the house 
a large reason for this is that incumbents have several builtin 
advantages their districts drawn up by their homestate 
legislatures are often shaped to include as many friendly voters as 
possible 
they usually have a much easier job than their opponents do of 
raising campaign money for the 1986 elections candidates in the 
435 house races spent 211 million with incumbents outspending 
challengers by almost 3to1 
in addition incumbents have staffs district offices mailing 
privileges telephones and other perks that they can turn to their 
political advantage 
they also get to introduce legislation that helps the folks back 
home in the final days of the 100th congress stallings got the 
house to pass legislation designating a new national reserve and a 
national monument in southern idaho 
while my opponent is issuing press releases im back here 
legislating he said of his rival republican dane watkins 
stallings of course was not the only house member last week 
eagerly awaiting the chance to return to his district for 
campaigning some other incumbents who face stiff challenges are 
seventerm veteran rep robert j lagomarsino rcalif whose 
challenger state sen gary k hart atypically expects to spend 
the same 1 million the incumbent has budgeted 
rep jim bates dcalif whose gop opponent attorney rob 
butterfield received a boost from reports that bates has sexually 
harassed female staff aides 
rep pat swindall rga who was running a tight race against 
democrat ben jones even before swindalls indictment on charges of 
lying to a grand jury investigating money laundering 
rep john hiler rind who faces a rematch with democrat tom 
ward whom he defeated by 47 votes in 1986s closest congressional 
contest 
rep clyde holloway rla who like two years ago is challenged 
by democrat faye williams the economically blighted district is 85 
percent democratic and 35 percent black but holloway a white 
defeated williams who is black by 51 percent to 49 percent last 
time 
rep bill emerson rmo a fourterm member who underwent 
treatment for alcoholism his district is one of the poorest in the 
country he faces democrat wayne cryts whom he narrowly defeated in 
1986 
a slew of north carolina incumbents including democratic rep 
david price who is challenged by republican tom fetzer democratic 
rep stephen neal who faces republican lyons gray gop rep howard 
coble who won by 79 votes in 1986 and now faces democrat tom 
gilmore

colorados socalled taxpayers bill of rights amendment would 
require voters to decide all future tax increases except in 
emergencies cut the income tax by about 10 percent and limit 
residential property taxes to 1 percent of market value 
utah voters face three tax initiatives that together would reduce

republicans looking for gauges of how they will 
fare in the nations 33 senate races on election day can take little 
hope from the two most closely contested battles florida and 
washington state 
washington and florida have open seats that republicans hope to 
claim in their uphill battle for retaking control of the senate 
which they won in 1980 and lost six years later in both democrats 
are showing surprising lastminute strength 
in washington where polls show a dead heat republican former 
sen slade gorton is airing testimonial ads that seek to plant 
doubts about the ideology of liberal rep mike lowry mike lowry 
scares the hell out of me says one voter in the ad 
but lowry is running strongly with appeals to environmental and 
social issues and criticisms of gortons record 
republican rep connie mack is taking a similar tack in florida 
he is trying to link his opponent rep buddy mackay to democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis in a tv spot that claims both 
are against such weapons systems as the b1 bomber the mx missile 
and president reagans star wars defense idea 
hey buddy and mike youre liberal it concludes but polls 
show the two candidates dead even despite vice president george 
bushs 20point advantage over dukakis in the state 
democrats now enjoy a 5446 advantage in the senate republicans 
longshot hopes to shift five seats depend on a combination of money 
and a good bush showing in key states in some areas the favorite 
tactic is to link the democrat to dukakis 
but as it has throughout this election year the scorecard still 
seems to be leaning the democrats way 
of 15 democrats seeking reelection all are considered at least 
safe some hold doubledigit leads of the dozen gop incumbents two 
nevada sen chic hecht and appointed nebraska sen david karnes 
are trailing popular democratic challengers 
in six open seats where no incumbent is on the ballot the gop 
holds a decided advantage in vermont and mississippi the democrats 
in virginia and wisconsin and two florida and washington are up 
for grabs 
republicans have conceded all along that they would need every 
lucky break to retake the senate including a strong coattail effect 
from bush while the presidential contest seemed to be giving 
marginal boosts to republican hopefuls in a few states it appears 
far short of the kind of sweep that gave the gop senate control in 
1980 when a 12seat shift accompanied reagans landslide white 
house win 
its not like 1980 when there was a need among voters to voice 
change said tom mason communications director for the republican 
national senatorial committee 
robert a chlopak executive director of the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee agreed 1980 was a repudiation of 
high interest rates you dont have that dynamic this year 
to the extent there are themes running throughout the senate 
races they seem to be items chosen from the idea grabbag to suit 
each state the environment social security education crime and 
drugs and family issues such as day care are favorites 
democrats have sought to claim the issues as their own but 
republicans have made use of them as well 
seen less frequently are the ideological labeling campaigns such 
as the gop is waging in florida and washington and vague for the 
future or for the state appeals 
here is a rundown on some of the pivotal contests 
washington in addition to each other lowry and gorton are 
battling their own negative images the formerly bearded and 
oftenrumpled lowry has adopted a cleancut neatly pressed persona 
and toned down his rhetoric to appease voters wary of his 
liberalism gorton has done televised mea culpas for the cold 
and haughty reputation that contributed to his 1986 defeat 
florida mackays surprising strength may stem partly from his 
comefrombehind victory in a democratic primary runoff oct 4 that 
kept his name before the voters and the party appears united behind 
him mack who has held poll leads throughout the election season 
against a changing array of democratic opponents has been 
criticized for running an outmoded 1980style campaign based on 
reaganesque less government themes if presidential coattails 
have an effect this year they will show up here 
connecticut incumbent republican lowell weicker always has a 
tight contest a recent university of connecticut poll showed him 
even with state attorney general joe lieberman who is running as a 
nutsandbolts politician and accusing weicker of being preoccupied 
with grand consititutional issues and forgetting his states 
parochial interests weicker a skillful politician is not to be 
counted out 
new jersey some of the nastiest television ads of the year 
appear to be eroding the margin of freshman incumbent frank 
lautenberg his gop opponent pete dawkins found that his own 
impressive resume rhodes scholar heisman trophy winner army 
general didnt automatically translate into political capital but 
republicans now claim public resentment of lautenbergs own negative 
advertising has put dawkins within striking distance 
nevada hecht the incumbent criticized as inarticulate and 
ineffective has always been the underdog against popular democratic 
gov richard bryan but recent developments have tightened the 
spread to single digits dukakis surprised bryan forces by 
announcing support for nevada as the site of a highlevel nuclear 
waste repository known locally as the screw nevada plan hecht 
is busily linking the two governors while bryan is scrambling to 
establish independence from dukakis on the issue 
wisconsin gop nominee susan engeleiter has used televised 
debates to chip away at the lead of millionaire democrat herb kohl 
a political novice kohl has sought to turn his wealth and 
selffinanced campaign into a selling point calling himself 
nobodys senator but yours and reaching for the independent 
mantle of retiring sen william proxmire time is on kohls side 
mississippi republican rep trent lott holds a small and 
shrinking lead over democratic rep wayne dowdy who is appealing to 
the states democratic tradition and supporters of retiring veteran 
sen john stennis lott holds a 41 financial advantage going into 
the home stretch which with bushs popularity could make the 
difference

minorco sas decision to drop its proposed 473 
billion hostile takeover of consolidated gold fields plc does not 
necessarily mean the south african partnership is halting its 
pursuit of gold fields analysts say 
minorco dropped its bid tuesday after the governments monopolies 
and mergers commission said it would investigate the deals impact 
on the market for strategic metals effectively blocking the deal 
from proceeding for up to three months 
the offer the biggest takeover bid ever for a british company 
had been conditioned on it not being referred to the commission 
although some analysts said minorco might sell its 296 percent 
stake in gold fields others said minorco likely would wait to see 
the outcome of the investigation and proceed with a new bid if the 
commission rules in its favor 
the developments followed a us district judges decision in new 
york on monday to issue a temporary injunction against the offer on 
antitrust grounds gold fields had contended that a takeover by 
minorco would give that company control of 35 percent of the western 
worlds gold supplies compared with its present 20 percent share 
gold fields owns a 493 percent stake in new yorkbased newmont 
mining corp plus minority stakes in australian and south african 
mining companies minorco has said it would sell gold fields 
newmont and south african holdings if its bid succeeded 
minorcos offer was for 19 pounds 3325 in cash and one 
minorco share for every two gold fields shares it didnt already 
own at tuesdays closing level for minorco shares of 658 pence 
1152 the offer valued each consolidated gold fields share at 
1279 pounds 2238 
consolidated gold fields shares plummeted on news of the 
referral falling 106 pence 185 to finish at 1139 pounds 
1997 on londons stock exchange 
graham birch an analyst with the london investment firm 
kleinwort grieveson securities ltd said the commissions decision 
was a setback for minorco but he said the commission likely would 
rule in minorcos favor and that minorco could then revive its bid 
gold fields has raised strong objections to being acquired by a 
company that is south africancontrolled minorco is the 
luxembourgbased investment arm of the south african gold and 
diamond mining giants anglo american corp and de beers 
consolidated mines ltd the wealthy south african oppenheimer family 
holds unspecified stakes in the latter two companies 
minorco is unlikely to return to its former role of passive 
investor in gold fields which it has played since first taking a 
significant stake in the company in the early 1980s analysts agreed 
gold fields chairman rudolph agnew said at a news conference that 
the company plans to continue its defensive tactics including 
taking steps to boost its share price agnew who said he was 
delighted by the decision to turn the case over the monopolies 
commission would not elaborate on what steps gold fields might take 
trade secretary lord young who referred the matter to the 
monopolies commission asked it to report to him within three months 
the investigation will center on the proposed takeovers impact 
on strategic metals titanium and zircon in particular a spokesman 
at the department of trade and industry said 
it was thought a merger would lead to greater concentration of 
the worlds supply which would be a potential detriment to users in 
the uk said the department spokesman who spoke on condition he 
was not identified 
titanium a metal largely used as a whitener in paints also is 
used in jet engines zircon is mainly used as a refracting agent in 
glass and steel furnaces but is also a critical substance in 
nuclear submarines and power plants and in rocket nose cones 
one possible course of action that could satisfy the commission 
would be for minorco to sell consolidated gold fields interests

us automakers say they sold 148 percent more 
cars and light trucks in midoctober than they did one year ago 
when the stock market crash and lack of dealer incentives kept 
buyers away from showrooms 
automakers on tuesday reported selling 318664 cars and light 
trucks during the oct 1120 period this year compared with 246835 
during the same period last year 
there were nine selling days in midoctober this year and eight 
last year so the percentage change is based on the daily sales rate 
rather than on total sales for the period 
for months the yeartoyear sales comparisons have been colored 
by heavy use of incentives in the summer and early autumn of 1987 
but most of those incentives expired oct 1 1987 while incentives 
continued this month further fogging comparisons 
sales in midoctober 1988 were beginning to return to a more 
normal pace said analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co 
international inc 
were beginning to compare against a very weak period last 
year including the october 19 stock market crash she said 
youre probably going to see the same kind of numbers in the next 
10day period 
among the big three automakers chrysler corp car sales rose to 
29269 this year from 19909 a 307 percent increase on the basis 
of daily sales in the midoctober period this year chrysler has 
sold 873107 cars compared with 775401 cars it had sold by oct 20 
last year a 121 percent rise 
part of the midoctober increase heaney said is attributable to 
chryslers shifting some smallcar production in 1987 and the 
introduction of two popular large cars 
you have the dodge dynasty and chrysler new yorker which 
were launched at this time last year and those sales have been 
strong all year she said that helps build this number up 
ford motor co reported a 144 percent surge in its car sales in 
midoctober going to 59613 this year from 46335 last year so far 
this year ford has sold 1803920 cars an 89 percent rise from 
the 1650391 cars it sold through oct 20 last year 
general motors corp the nations largest automaker said it 
sold 93086 cars during midoctober up 81 percent from the 76509 
cars it sold during the same period last year in 1988 gms car 
sales have increased 03 percent to 2984066 from 2962654 last 
year

kraft inc determined to retain its 
independence or drive up the price of any takeover has told hostile 
suitor philip morris cos inc it would negotiate only if philip 
morris raised its 90 a share takeover bid to more than 110 a share 
in a strongly worded letter tuesday kraft chairman and chief 
executive officer john richman said his company was determined to 
push ahead with a defensive recapitalization plan that it proposed 
when kraft rejected philip morris 11 billion buyout offer 
the recapitalization plan will take place only if our 
shareholders approve it said richman in a letter to hamish 
maxwell his counterpart at philip morris 
kraft will not pressure its shareholders nor will kraft permit 
you to stampede them said richman 
kraft stock which soared 10 a share on monday closed down 3 a 
share at 99 tuesday in active new york stock exchange trading 
kraft contends the recapitalization announced sunday would pay 
shareholders more than 110 a share in cash and securities 
the suburban chicagobased company has acknowledged that interest 
and principal payments for such a program are estimated at more than 
124 billion and analysts say kraft maker of velveeta cheese 
sealtest ice creams and a raft of other fresh and frozen food 
products would increase its debt tenfold to finance the plan and 
would be forced to sell some operations to pay for it 
even so richman indicated kraft will not be pressured into 
accepting terms its board considers inadequate 
kraft was not for sale and is not for sale there is no 
auction of kraft if philip morris or another company truly 
wishes to negotiate with kraft a simple phone call proposing the 
sweetened price is all that is necessary said richman 
new yorkbased philip morriss response suggested that call 
wouldnt be forthcoming soon 
everybody from the market itself to arbitrageurs to people who 
have evaluated the matter have questioned whether their 
recapitalization is worth anywhere near 110 a spokesman for 
philip morris who refused to be named said tuesday 
as for the letter were evaluating our options he said 
and at the moment we have nothing more to say about it 
both the market and some analysts reacted unfavorably 
quite frankly philip morris offer looked like a pretty good 
beginning said john maxwell jr who tracks the food industry for 
wheat first securities inc of richmond va 
while i thought kraft might get a few dollars more at 90 a 
share the first takeover offer was already about 15 for 16 times 
the earnings for 1988 a pretty good premium 
john bierbusse analyst with ag edwards amp sons in st louis 
said the letter contained nothing new 
obviously kraft felt some need to clarify the position it 
expressed with the recapitalization but i think its safe to call 
the 110 figure overvalued 
kraft already has been restructuring for several years to shed 
its nonfood operations

the dollar rose slightly in quiet european trading 
this morning as the market waited for release of the preliminary 
report on us economic growth in the third quarter 
gold prices also were up slightly in calm trading 
foreign exchange dealers said the thirdquarter gross national 
product figures scheduled for release later today would probably 
provide some guidance to the market 
one frankfurt dealer said the market expects a 3 percent to 35 
percent rise in the gnp its nothing much to look forward to 
the dealer said noting that the gnp expanded at a 3 percent pace in 
the second quarter 
a trader in rome predicted the gnp figures would have little 
impact on the foreign exchange market 
maybe it will move the waters for about 10 minutes but the 
dollar is basically trendless he said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 007 yen to a closing 12680 yen later in london 
it was quoted higher at 12685 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late tuesdays

the 225issue nikkei stock average a 13995point winner 
tuesday added another 19911 points or 073 percent to finish 
trading at 2762060 the nikkei quickly gained 9951 points when 
the morning session began and continued rising afterwards 
a broker with daiwa securities said dealers who had been 
restrained by uncertainty over emperor hirohitos continuing illness 
finally began reacting to favorable economic indicators and started 
buying stocks 
people were looking around for a wide variety of issues he 
said speaking anonymously he added that this helped boost 
wednesdays trading volume which was estimated at 19 billion

the nations economy grew at a modest 22 percent annual rate in 
the third quarter the poorest performance in about two years the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said the summer drought a deterioration 
in the nations trade performance and a drop in government purchases 
of defense equipment were responsible for the week growth 
the changes left the gross national product the broadest measure 
of the economys health rising at the slowest pace since a 14 
percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1986 
the gnp advance was down from increases of 34 percent in the 
first quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of inflation and 
interest rate trends prices rallied following the report the 
treasurys bellwether 30year bond was up about 5 per 1000 face 
amount while its yield fell to 887 percent from 893 percent 
tuesday 
the commerce department reported tuesday that total orders for 
durable goods fell 50 billion to a seasonally adjusted 1177 
billion last month pulled down by dramatic declines in the volatile 
defense and transportation sectors 
the dollar edged lower against the british pound and japanese yen 
but managed to rise against other major currencies the pound was 
quoted in late new york trading at 17515 up from 17501 late 
monday while the dollar declined to 12680 yen from 12702 yen 
the stock market finished narrowly mixed as a trading frenzy in 
takeover issues subsided the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
gained 302 points to close at 217336 
currency traders took the decline in durable goods orders as a 
sign that the us economy could be slowing down something that 
would tend to reduce demand for dollars by foreign investors 
but economists were reluctant to conclude that the nations 
manufacturing boom is ending 
in other economic news on tuesday 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
homes fell 22 percent in september after a surprisingly strong 
summer the decline occurred despite a housing boom in california 
automakers reported that sales of usmade cars and light 
trucks rose 148 percent in midoctober from a weak period a year 
earlier 
the government said wages in the past 12 months have risen an 
average 39 percent private employer costs for benefits have soared 
67 percent more than double the previous year largely on 
increases in social security taxes 
the durable goods report for september fits in with other signs 
of a slowdown last month including the second consecutive decline 
in retail sales and a drop in manufacturing employment 
but analysts said it was too soon to declare that manufacturing 
which has driven robust economic growth this year is slowing 
significantly 
a boom in export sales fueled by the lower value of the dollar 
has kept factories humming manufacturers in turn have invested 
heavily to expand the capacity of their plants spurring the fastest 
growth in capital spending since 1984 
durable goods items expected to last three or more years 
include a wide range of manufactured items from refrigerators and 
other household appliances to large computers and battleships 
orders had jumped 57 percent in august plummeted 74 percent in 
july and soared 87 percent in june

before wang was sentenced his lawyer ira l sorkin told the 
judge his client fully recognizes the seriousness of the crimes 
at no time has he sought to minimize his involvement or the 
seriousness of what he has done 
sorkin said hes broke he has no job hes unable to finish 
his education he has no place to live except with relatives he 
disgraced his family and hurt the firm that trusted him 
wang wearing a gray suit with dark dotted tie told duffy im 
deeply sorry for what ive done ive incurred a lot of debts and 
losses of other people im going to try to make amends for it 
but duffy calling it a particularly troubling case rebuked wang 
because he had grown up in an affluent family and no excuse for what 
he did 
apparently the first time you could have been a crook you 
were duffy said 
in the eyes of society a person who knowingly goes out to harm 
the world becomes a person who must be punished the judge said 
duffy said a fine was inappropriate because wang had no money 
as far as i can figure out youre worth zero the judge 
said therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area of 
imprisonment 
duffy gave wang one month to get his affiars in order before 
surrendering to the us bureau of prisons the exact location has 
not been determined but sorkin told reporters afterward he would 
try to have wang placed in a facility near his family who live in 
the chicago area 
sorkin declined to comment on the appropriateness of the 
sentence saying i dont try to secondguess judges 
assistant us attorney john mcenany also declined to comment on 
the sentence he also would not comment on possible efforts to 
prosecute lee who is believed to be in hong kong

the us economy grew at a modest 22 percent 
annual rate from july through september the weakest performance in 
almost two years the government reported today 
the commerce department blamed the weak growth rate on the impact 
of the summer drought a deterioration in the countrys trade 
performance and a drop in government purchases of defense equipment 
the changes left the gross national product the broadest measure 
of the economys health rising at the slowest pace since a 14 
percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1986 
the gnp advance was down from increases of 34 percent in the 
first quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year 
with the slower growth came an easing in inflationary pressures 
as a price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 44 
percent from july through september down from 55 percent in the 
second quarter 
many economists viewed the gnp report as good news because the 
slowdown should reduce the need for the federal reserve to drive 
interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand in an overheated 
economy 
the burden will certainly be off the fed to tighten because of 
inflationary pressures said michael evans head of a washington 
forecasting firm this appears to be heading us toward the soft 
landing everyone was looking for 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner said that the latest gnp 
report shows the economy is still enjoying steady growth in the 
expansion following the 198182 recession 
next month marks the sixth anniversary of this economic 
expansion he said with good policy direction and a bit of 
luck we can break the alltime record expansion of almost nine 
years achieved during the 1960s 
the 22 percent gnp growth rate was sharply lower than had been 
expected many private analysts had been looking for growth of 
around 32 percent in the third quarter even higher than the second 
quarter 
the weakerthananticipated showing threw in doubt the ability of 
the economy to meet the reagan administrations projection of 35 
percent growth for the entire year 
reaching that level will require an increase of 34 percent in 
the fourth quarter given the fact that many analysts believe the 
economy has begun to slow a rebound in growth in the final three 
months of the year is not considered likely 
the government said growth in both the second and third quarters 
was depressed by the drought 
without the loss of farm output the economy would have raced 
ahead at a 43 percent rate in the second quarter and 28 percent in 
the third quarter 
also depressing growth in the third quarter was the first 
quarterly deterioration in the countrys trade performance in a 
year the deficit between imports and exports widened at an annual 
rate of 27 billion in the third quarter 
this setback was blamed on the fact that imports which had 
fallen in the second quarter shot up by 124 percent swamping a 
101 percent rise in imports 
government spending dropped at a rate of 27 billion in the 
third quarter after having risen by 74 billion in the second 
quarter the turnaround was blamed on a big decline in defense 
purchases 
before todays report many economists had been looking for the 
economy to turn in its best growth performance since 1984 the last 
presidential election year 
in that year the gnp had shot up by 64 percent a giant 
increase that many believed helped president reagan win reelection 
george bush has been campaigning on a prosperity theme this year 
citing the fact that the country is now enjoying a peacetime record 
six straight years of economic growth 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
rising at a rate of 221 billion in the third quarter to a new 
level of 4007 trillion 
consumer spending which has propelled growth throughout the long 
recovery continued to provide much of the momentum in the third 
quarter rising at a rate of 35 percent up from a 3 percent 
increase in the second quarter 
business investment which has been surging this year as industry 
rushed to expand production facilities rose by 46 percent in the 
third quarter down from a 15 percent jump in the second quarter 
residential construction which has been weak this year rose a 
modest 13 percent in the third quarter

ford motor co said today its earnings 
rose 218 percent to a record in the third quarter compared with the 
same threemonth period last year based on strong overseas sales 
the nations no 2 automaker said it earned 8563 million or 
178 per share in the julyseptember period up from 7032 
million or 138 per share during the third quarter of 1987 
revenue rose nearly 16 percent to 177 billion from 153 
billion a year earlier 
fords stock fell 37 cents a share to 5362 a share by 
midmorning on the new york stock exchange as the overall market lost 
ground 
the earnings during the quarter were down 484 percent from the 
companys industry record of 166 billion in earnings in the second 
quarter typically thirdquarter earnings are lower than other 
quarters for automakers because of factory retooling to gear up for 
the new model year which traditionally begins oct 1 
the ford teams successful effort worldwide to provide products 
with improved quality and good customer value again is evident in 
our thirdquarter results ford chairman donald petersen and vice 
chairman harold poling said in a joint statement 
the company said its overseas earnings amounted to 384 million 
during the quarter up 249 percent from the 110 million earned from 
overseas operations during the period last year 
in the united states the companys earnings fell 204 percent to 
472 million during the third quarter this year from 593 million 
during the period last year ford blamed the performance on higher 
costs for new products and lower earnings by fords financial 
services group 
general motors corp and chrysler corp are expected to announce 
their thirdquarter earnings figures thursday 
for the first nine months of the year fords earnings rose 122 
percent to 41 billion or 853 a share on sales of 609 
billion compared with earnings of 37 billion or 717 a share 
on sales of 529 billion a 122 percent increase 
for the first two quarters of 1988 ford posted industry world 
records making 162 billion in the januarymarch period and 166 
billion in the apriljune period 
in the first two quarters of this year ford said its 
recordsetting profits also were bolstered by strong international 
sales mostly from europe fords domestic sales fell during the 
first half of the year compared with the first six months of 1987 
because of incentives higher labor and material costs and

stephen wang a former rookie securities analyst 
who pleaded guilty to participating in the second biggest insider 
trading case in history was sentenced to three years imprisonment 
today by a federal judge who told him you had a brilliant future 
and you blew it 
wang 24 stood motionless as us district court judge kevin 
duffy lectured him about his illegal act before imposing the 
sentence which also includes three years probation 
wang who would be eligible for parole after a year could have 
been sentenced to five years and heavy fines for each of three fraud 
counts against him 
shaking his head duffy said stephen wang i hope to god you 
never end up in a court of law again 
wang a former junior analyst at the investment firm morgan 
stanley amp co admitted to scheming with taiwanborn businessman 
fred c lee to profit on secret tips about impending corporate 
takeovers that morgan stanley was handling lee who is not in the 
united states allegedly made 19 million on the information 
provided between july 1987 and april 1988 and paid 200000 to wang 
the securities and exchange commission which sued the pair in 
late june had demanded the return of the illegal profits plus 
triple damages for a total of 76 million making it the second 
biggest insider trading case behind that of convicted felon ivan 
boesky 
in 1986 boesky agreed to pay a 100 million penalty to settle 
charges of trading on insider information he is serving a 
threeyear prison term after pleading guilty last year to conspiring 
to file a false statement with the sec 
before wang was sentenced his lawyer ira l sorkin told the 
judge his client fully recognizes the seriousness of the crimes 
at no time has he sought to minimize his involvement or the 
seriousness of what he has done 
sorkin said hes broke he has no job hes unable to finish 
his education he has no place to live except with relatives he 
disgraced his family and hurt the firm that trusted him 
wang wearing a gray suit with a dark dotted tie told duffy 
im deeply sorry for what ive done ive incurred a lot of debts 
and losses of other people im going to try to make amends for it 
but duffy calling it a particularly troubling case rebuked wang 
because he had grown up in an affluent family and had no excuse for 
what he did 
apparently the first time you could have been a crook you 
were duffy said 
in the eyes of society a person who knowingly goes out to harm 
the world becomes a person who must be punished the judge said 
duffy said a fine was inappropriate because wang had no money 
as far as i can figure out youre worth zero the judge 
said therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area of 
imprisonment 
duffy gave wang one month to get his affairs in order before 
surrendering to the us bureau of prisons the exact location of 
his imprisonment has not been determined but sorkin told reporters 
afterward he would try to have wang placed in a facility near his 
family who live in the chicago area 
sorkin declined to comment on the appropriateness of the 
sentence saying i dont try to secondguess judges 
assistant us attorney john mcenany also declined comment on the 
sentence he also would not comment on possible efforts to prosecute 
lee who is believed to be in hong kong

cray research incs announcement that its 
1988 earnings growth would be less than expected not only caused one 
of the largest oneday declines in the supercomputer makers stock 
but also hurt its credibility on wall street analysts say 
cray is getting savaged by earnings revisions said michael 
geran an analyst in new york for nikko securities co international 
inc 
earlier this year cray predicted 10 percent earnings growth for 
1988 but on monday it reduced that to 5 to 7 percent 
on tuesday crays stock on the new york stock exchange lost 9 
to close at 5987 a decline of 131 percent on a trading volume 
of nearly 17 million shares it slipped another 12 cents in early 
trading today to 5975 a share 
in the past two years the stock has traded has high as 135 a 
share 
analysts said the oneday decline tuesday was the largest they 
could remember for cray and they attributed it to mondays surprise 
announcement 
i think theres been credibility damage and there will be a 
lingering impact said gary smaby a minneapolisbased analyst for 
needham amp co inc in new york 
the fact is that weve seen nothing but news of decreasing 
earnings expectations for the last year and a half and a lot of 
investors are fatigued with the story said jeffrey canin an 
analyst for hambrecht amp quist in san francisco 
investors looking to get into the stock now are going to have 
to take a longerterm investment horizon about 12 to 18 months 
smaby said there will be no meaningful earnings and revenues 
growth next year 
cray said the decline in anticipated 1988 earnings is primarily 
the result of an additional 10 million in spending on the cray3 
supercomputer the latest development of company founder seymour 
cray 
next years revenues are expected to be adversely affected by 
increasing tradein allowances and a shift toward computers being 
leased rather than sold the company said 
canin said cray is moving through a difficult product transition 
period from the cray2 to the notyetintroduced cray3 and from the 
enhanced versions of its older cray xmp supercomputers to the new 
cray ymp

supermarket giant aampp today withdrew a 210 
million tender offer for delchamps inc a day after directors of 
the mobile alabased grocery chain rejected a higher merger 
proposal 
at a meeting late monday delchamps directors decided aampps 
proposal to acquire the chain for 32ashare or 32 a share in a 
friendly transaction was inadequate 
james wood chairman and chief executive of the great atlantic amp 
pacific tea co called that proposal a final offer the company 
had a 30ashare tender offer outstanding 
af delchamps jr chairman of the board and president of the 
company that bears his name replied we would hope that mr wood 
can be taken at his word since we agree with him that the 
dissension brought on by this takeover fight is not in the best 
interest of our company or our shareholders 
joel swanson a delchamps spokesman said the ninemember board 
unanimously rejected the sweetened offer aampp began trying to buy 
delchamps two years ago but this year became more aggressive by 
launching a tender offer 
delchamps attorney james h mcdonald jr said the boards 
decision was based on a number of factors including delchamps 
recent store expansion efforts and other programs designed to 
enhance the value of the company 
he said the boards decision was also based upon the advice of 
counsel that such a takeover could pose antitrust problems 
delchamps has a federal court suit pending in mobile against aampp 
on the antitrust allegations aampp which is 52 percent owned by the 
tengelmann group of west germany filed a countersuit 
delchamps had sales of about 700 million last year aampp had 
sales of 96 billion in 1987 from its 1170 stores in this country 
and canada 
delchamps has 103 stores in alabama mississippi florida and 
louisiana and six liquor stores

unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials slipped 497 to 216839 
by 11 am on wall street 
losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 458 up 686 down and 
535 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 6124 million shares at 
midmorning 
the government estimated this morning that the gross national 
product grew at a 22 percent annual rate after adjustment for 
inflation in the third quarter of the year 
that fell short of most advance estimates and marked the slowest 
pace since the final three months of 1986 
wall street has been looking for evidence of slower business 
expansion growth as reassurance that the economy was not approaching 
the point of overheating 
but the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an 
improved international trade balance increased business investment 
and a slackening in consumer spending 
the dollar weakened after the report was issued and so after a 
brief period of hesitation did stock prices as well

four major commercial banks have asked the 
federal reserve board for broad powers to underwrite and deal in 
corporate securities after congress failed to pass legislation 
granting such authority 
the applications by citicorp chase manhattan corp jp morgan 
amp co and bankers trust new york corp were sent to the new york 
federal reserve bank on tuesday according to a fed spokesman 
banking experts say they expect most other big banks to follow 
suit 
if congress cant agree to do it the banks will attempt every 
possibility they can don ogilvie an executive vice president 
with the american bankers association said wednesday 
the move by the four banks could set the stage for a battle 
between congress and the fed over which body will determine the 
future structure of the banking industry 
fed chairman alan greenspan has supported banks efforts to win 
broader securities powers and manuel johnson a fed governor said 
recently that the central bank would look favorably on bank 
applications for greater securities powers if congress adjourned 
without passing legislation 
attempts by congress to repeal the depressionera glasssteagall 
act which separates commercial and investment banking have been 
underway for six years 
the most promising bill by william proxmire dwis and chairman 
of the senate banking committee died in the house along with more 
restrictive bill passed by the house banking committee 
after it appeared his bill was doomed proxmire encouraged banks 
to turn to the fed for broader powers 
in their applications citicorp chase morgan and bankers trust 
sought permission to underwrite and deal in corporate debt 
chase morgan and bankers trust also sought permission to deal 
and underwrite stock with chase and bankers trust adding preferred 
stock to their wish list 
two weeks ago chase president thomas labrecque had vowed to seek 
fed approval if efforts to pass legislation failed 
banks have maintained that they need expanded powers to compete 
with foreign banks that can underwrite securities in this country 
while critics maintain such powers could endanger the safety of the 
nations banking system 
last spring the us supreme court upheld a lower court ruling 
that allowed the fed to grant more than a dozen banks authority to 
underwrite commercial paper municipal revenue bonds 
mortgagebacked securities and securties backed by consumer loans

gordon gekko the ruthless inside trader in the 
movie wall street had a motto greed is good that to 
many encapsulated the philosophy of freewheeling corporate merger 
speculators 
members of congress after passing the first legislative response 
to the wave of insider trading scandals that erupted two years ago 
are hoping to replace the motto with another greed is 
dangerous 
greed and fear are competing emotions but until now there has 
not been a proper balance between the two i think now the fear of 
apprehension is going to be at least as great as the lure of 
greed said rep edward j markey dmass chief sponsor of the 
bill and chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees the 
securities markets 
the bill passed the house 4100 last month and by a voice vote in 
the senate early saturday morning in the waning hours of the 100th 
congress the securities industrys chief lobby group acquiesced to 
the legislation and president reagan is expected to sign it 
its key provisions would 
increase the maximum criminal penalties for insider trading from 
five years in jail to 10 years and boost fines from 500000 to 
25 million for a company and from 100000 to 1 million for an 
individual 
hold firms liable to fines for the actions of their employees if 
the firms knowingly or recklessly fail to detect and prevent 
insider trading 
authorize the securities and exchange commission to offer a 
bounty to tipsters of up to 10 percent of any fine collected 
codify the right of investors to sue inside traders if they lost 
money by trading in the same securities and at the same time as 
insiders 
permit the sec to issue subpoenas and investigate inside trading 
on behalf of foreign countries with the idea that foreign countries 
would offer reciprocal privileges to the united states 
the sec and the industry had been pushing for a legislative 
definition of inside trading which until now has been defined by 
regulators and the courts 
but to win the support of house energy and commerce chairman 
john dingell dmich the bill leaves inside trading undefined 
dingell believes a written definition would in effect become a 
road map to evasion providing defense attorneys with loopholes the 
industry complains it is unfair to give only vague guidance 
markey predicted the most immediate effect of the bill will be to 
change the attitude toward insider trading a crime that is both 
hard to detect and difficult to prove 
jail is the greatest fear these white collar criminals have 
markey said in addition firms because of the new liability 
provisions cant be like the three monkeys and say just because 
they are deaf dumb and blind they can get off he said 
john c baldwin president of the north american securities 
administrators association an organization of state regulators 
said he hopes the most immediate psychological effect will be on 
small investors who have been scared out of the market by the 
perception that the little guy cant get a fair deal trading in the 
same stocks as bigtime arbitragers 
if john q public feels like hes the only guy not making a 
profit and the inside traders are cutting all the good deals hes 
going to take his business elsewhere the first thing this bill does 
is give the individual investor the feeling that someone cares about 
him he said 
the impact from provisions granting individuals the right to sue 
insiders and offering bounties to informers may take longer to 
emerge but ultimately could be more profound 
were in a litigious society if people or their lawyers can 
find a way to go after deep pockets theyll usually do it said 
edward i obrien president of the securities industry association 
at the urging of the sia markey made the threshold for suing 
firms the knowing or reckless clause tougher than originally 
proposed 
the sia also has reservations about the bounties as does sec 
chairman david s ruder who has said juries may not believe a 
witness who was paid a bounty 
its somehow a little offensive to me its a little bit in the 
big brother tradition obrien said 
but markey argues that bounties have worked well for the irs in 
catching tax cheats and he said he is working on a plan to offer 
ruder an incentive to use bounties despite his qualms 
the sec under ruder has sought more money to hire additional 
enforcement attorneys markey said next year hed like to find a way 
to give the agency a cut of any extra fine revenue that is produced 
by offering bounties

in a move to increase its stock value tenneco 
inc initiated a cash tender offer today to buy back 18 million 
shares of its own stock for more than 1 billion through a dutch 
auction 
tenneco chairman james l ketelson said the sale of tenneco oil 
earlier this month and the proposed repurchase of 1218 percent of 
tennecos total outstanding stock demonstrates the companys 
commitment to increasing shareholder value by concentrating its 
resources on its most promising opportunities 
however some on wall street were expected to view the terms of 
the share repurchase as disappointing 
in a dutch auction which tenneco launched early today 
shareholders specify the price at which they are willing to sell 
their stock back to the company within a range established by the 
buyer 
based upon the number and price of the shares tendered tenneco 
officials said they will determine the single per share price within 
a specified 5055 range that will permit the company to buy all 18 
million shares tenneco then will buy the stock tendered at that 
price or less subject to possible proration 
the cash sales will not be subject to the usual transaction costs 
associated with open market sales tenneco officials said 
john olson an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc said a 
dutch auction is probably the most sensible way to buy back 
stock but he said tennecos offer is not likely to win acclaim on 
wall street where analysts were expecting a more conventional offer 
at a higher price of 60 or so 
on the new york stock exchange tennecos shares were trading at 
50 this morning up from 49875 on tuesday 
olson said houstonbased tenneco is passing up a godgiven 
opportunity to build the strongest balance sheet in years 
buying back stock may be attractive to some shareholders but 
it doesnt augment the company for the long term olson said 
he attributed that buyback decision to tennecos management 
being under pressure to do something for the shareholders 
they sold off their crown jewel tenneco oil that gives them 
a great opportunity to go into the next business downcycle with a 
strong balance sheet and golden opportunities to acquire companies 
in related areas that would be hard hit by any recession olson 
said 
tennecos offer is not conditioned upon any minimum number of 
shares being tendered the only condition company officials said 
is that tenneco receive at least 15 billion in proceeds from its 
73 billion sale of tenneco oil the tender offer is set to expire 
at midnight nov 28 
after paying for the stock the company will use the remainder of 
the proceeds to reduce its hefty debt of 85 billion 
with the sale of its oil and gas properties tennecos biggest 
units will be the profitable natural gas pipeline and its case ih 
farm equipment manufacturing sector 
in addition tenneco maintains shipbuilding automotive 
packaging and chemicals units

employment costs have risen faster than 
inflation over the past 12 months but largely because of soaring 
benefit costs primarily from higher social security taxes rather 
than wage gains according to new government data 
wages in the 12 months ended oct 1 rose an average of 39 
percent the labor department said tuesday compared with a 42 
percent increase in consumer prices over the same period 
but benefit costs have soared more than 67 percent more than 
double the 31 percent gain during the previous 12 months the 
departments bureau of labor statistics said 
the combined effect of the pay raises and higher benefit costs 
sent total employer costs up 47 percent in the 12 months ended oct 
1 compared with a 34 percent rise in the previous 12month period 
it said 
the steep increase in benefit costs resulted primarily from a 
rise last january in employers social security tax rate from 715 
percent to 751 percent the government said 
but there also were large increases in health insurance costs the 
first nine months of this year it noted and for the first time 
the government is calculating lumpsum bonus payments from union 
contracts and profitsharing arrangements as a benefit 
previously those bonuses had not been included as either wages or 
benefits 
nonunion employees continued to get bigger percentage pay raises 
than union members a trend begun in 1983 except for bluecollar 
workers in manufacturing 
the labor department said wage rates among union members rose an 
average 29 percent in the past 12 months compared with 39 percent 
for nonunion workers in the previous 12month period union wages 
rose an average 17 percent compared with 38 percent for nonunion 
employees 
this pattern reversed when limited to bluecollar workers in 
manufacturing the bureau said with wage increases in the past 
year averaging 32 percent for union members and 28 percent for 
nonunion workers 
including the lumpsum bonus arrangements that have become a norm 
in many labor contracts especially in manufacturing total employer 
compensation costs have risen the same 45 percent for union and 
nonunion workers nationwide the bureau said 
john zalusky an economist for the aflcio called the statistics 
refreshing 
we expected they were in that range zalusky said theyre 
the government beginning to show in fact what is really going on 
out there in the world but there still is a good way to go 
for example zalusky cited the last round of steel industry 
contracts in which the union conceded pay cuts to companies then 
operating at losses in exchange for a share of future profits or 
stock transfers if no profits occurred 
the statistics are now picking up the profit distributions but 
not the stock transfers for what essentially is a debt owed 
workers he said in the future i expect them to start putting 
in the value of stock ownership plans and in the distant future 
retraining funds such as those negotiated with the auto companies 
despite the disparity in percentage wage increases in recent 
years union workers continue to make 35 percent more than nonunion 
workers an average gap of 123 a week in 1987 compared with a gap 
of 119 in 1986 on a nationwide basis according to government 
data 
among whitecollar workers wage increases averaged 42 percent 
over the past 12 months compared with 4 percent the previous 12 
months the government said bluecollar wages have increased 33 
percent and 26 percent respectively over the same two periods 
the biggest pay gains 56 percent on average were among 
business and health service workers followed by average increases 
of 49 percent for professional and technical employees 
managers and executives along with state and local government 
workers have averaged the same 47 percent wage gains over the past 
year the average pay increase among private industry workers was 
37 percent 
by regions the biggest pay increases over the past 12 months 
have been in the northeast 46 percent followed by the south at 
38 percent average raises in the west and midwest were 32 percent 
and 29 percent respectively 
in a separate report the labor department said annual pay rose 
an average 46 percent among the 101 million workers with jobs in 
the nations 317 metropolitan areas last year 
kenosha wis with large pay increases in manufacturing and 
construction had the biggest average increase up 106 percent 
from 18666 in 1986 to 20648 in 1987 
the new havenwaterburymeriden area of connecticut and the 
monmouthocean city nj metropolitan areas were next with average 
annual pay increases of 84 percent last year 
on the other end of the scale workers in flint mich with a 
large decline in employment and falling wages in manufacturing 
suffered an average pay loss of 42 percent from 26633 in 1986 
to 25514 last year 
other cities where average pay fell last year were anchorage 
alaska anderson ind enid okla lawrence kan lansing mich 
midland texas middlesexsomersethunterdon nj and pine bluff

a rookie wall street analyst who once impressed 
others as an ambitious gogetter received three years imprisonment 
wednesday for his role in the nations secondlargest insider 
trading fraud 
you truly fall into the situation of a person who bites the 
hand that feeds him us district judge kevin duffy said shaking 
his head as he sentenced stephen wang 24 you had a brilliant 
future and you blew it 
wang who had held a promising junior analyst job at morgan 
stanley amp co pleaded guilty last month to fraud for conspiring 
with taiwanese businessman fred c lee to profit in the stock market 
on secrets about impending corporate takeovers that wang stole from 
the firm 
he also pleaded guilty to a separate but much smaller insider 
trading scheme involving another person whom prosecutors have 
declined so far to identify 
wang and lee were first exposed in late june by the securities 
and exchange commission which said lee made about 19 million in 
illicit profits and paid wang 200000 for tips provided between 
july 1987 and last april 
morgan stanley which was deeply embarrassed and dismissed wang 
immediately said through spokesman peter roche that were pleased 
justice has been served 
lees us lawyer james morton did not return telephone calls 
for comment lee hasnt been charged with any crime and is believed 
to be living in hong kong 
the sec has won court orders freezing the us assets of wang and 
lee and is seeking return of the 19 million plus triple damages for 
a total of 76 million making it the secondbiggest insider trading 
scam behind the ivan boesky scandal 
a renowned stock speculator boesky paid the sec a record 100 
million in november 1986 to settle insider trading charges a 
stunning episode that signaled a government crackdown on wall street 
crime he was sentenced to three years imprisonment for conspiracy 
to lie to the enforcement agency 
the wanglee case received widespread attention not only because 
of the amount of money involved but because both men presumably 
were brazenly trading on inside information at the height of concern 
about the boesky affair many law enforcers said this showed insider 
trading remains a deeprooted problem 
wang could have been sentenced to five years imprisonment and a 
250000 fine for each of three counts against him but duffy a 
former sec regional administrator said he wasnt imposing a fine 
because wang had no money 
as far as i can figure out youre worth zero the judge 
said therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area of 
imprisonment 
duffy did not explain the rationale for the threeyear sentence 
which also includes three years probation but he lectured wang on 
what the judge called inexcusable acts by a young man who grew up in 
comfortable surroundings enjoyed a good education and was en route 
to a successful career 
you did have practically every break society could give you 
said the judge but apparently the first time you could have been 
a crook you were 
wang wearing a gray suit and dark tie fidgeted nervously before 
duffy pronounced the sentence and stood motionless while the judge 
spoke aside from a few reporters and bystanders the courtroom was 
empty 
im deeply sorry for what ive done wang told the judge 
ive incurred a lot of debts and losses of other people im going 
to try to make amends for it 
duffy gave wang a month to settle his affairs before reporting to 
the federal bureau of prisons his lawyer ira l sorkin said he 
would try to have wang placed in a facility near his family who 
live in the chicago area 
sorkin who like duffy is a former regional sec administrator 
declined to comment on the sentence assistant us attorney john m 
mcenany who represented the government in the case also declined 
to comment 
wang grew up in arlington heights ill attended the university 
of illinois and landed a coveted junior analyst job at morgan 
stanley in june 1986 as a student he excelled in economics and was 
considered an aspiring entrepreneur because he had started his own 
resume advisory service 
the local newspaper which published an admiring story about 
wangs business talents quoted him as saying that if you love 
what you do money comes along with it

occidental petroleum corp said wednesday that thirdquarter 
earnings more than doubled because of strong gains in its chemical 
unit while coastal corp said lower crude oil prices drove 
quarterly earnings down sharply 
occidentals earnings surged 128 percent to 105 million or 38 
cents a share in the threemonth period ended sept 30 compared 
with 46 million or 20 cents a share a year earlier 
the los angelesbased company said revenue rose 167 percent to 
49 billion from 42 billion in the 1987 quarter 
occidental chairman armand hammer said healthy advances in the 
companys chemical operations offset declines elsewhere 
although occidental has experienced the detrimental earnings 
effects of lower oil prices which in the third quarter of 1988 were 
more than 4 a barrel less than last year and the loss of our north 
sea oil production we are pleased to report that our chemical 
operations earnings have significantly increased and have resulted 
in occidentals net income more than doubling compared to the third 
quarter of 1987 hammer said 
occidental owned the huge oil rig that exploded and sank july 6 
in the north sea killing more than 160 people in the worlds worst 
oilfield disaster 
falling crude oil prices caused by an excess supply on world 
markets has hurt earnings and revenue of most major us oil 
companies but some have managed to compensate with gains in 
refining and marketing operations 
for the first nine months of 1988 occidentals earnings totaled 
295 million or 123 a share up 46 percent from 202 million or 90 
cents a share a year earlier revenue totaled 141 billion up 11 
percent from 127 billion 
houstonbased coastal corp said earnings fell 214 percent in 
the latest quarter to 92 million or 12 cents a share on revenue of 
18 billion vs 117 million or 17 cents a share on revenue of 
16 billion a year earlier 
for the first nine months of 1988 coastals earnings rose 105 
percent to 863 million or 145 a share from 781 million or 
143 a share in the same period last year the companys revenue 
totaled 57 billion up 163 percent from 49 billion a year

four out of 10 americans covered by health 
insurance have encountered some form of insurance fraud including 
being billed for unnecessary tests or for medical services they 
never received according to a national survey commissioned by an 
insurance company 
the survey which is to be released formally on thursday was 
conducted for aetna life amp casualty which estimates that health 
care insurance fraud is responsible for about 10 percent of the 555 
billion americans spend on health care each year 
the survey indicates that there is widespread public awareness 
more than we thought that health insurance fraud is hurting 
consumers james l garcia director of fraud investigations in 
aetnas employee benefits division said wednesday in an interview 
garcia said consumers end up paying higher premiums to cover the 
cost of fraud 
however the survey found that the most widespread form of health 
care insurance fraud is one that few consumers complain about 
twentythree percent of the respondents said their practitioners 
had accepted insurance reimbursement as full payment even though 
their policies required the patient to pay a portion of the bill 
three out of five people required to pay a portion of their 
medical bills said they would consider switching to a doctor who 
practices that form of fraud 
to us that was an astonishing figure garcia said 
he said the study indicated that practitioners who would alter 
bills in that fashion were likely to practice other forms of fraud 
such as billing for unnecessary tests or services not provided 
ten percent of the survey respondents said they had been billed 
for laboratory tests they felt were unnecessary and 6 percent said 
their practitioners had inflated charges 
other forms of fraud cited were billing for services not rendered 
and charging more for services than had been discussed with the 
patient 
sixty percent of those responding to the survey said they had no 
experience with fraudulent tactics 
garcia said the study contained both good and bad news for 
insurance companies on the positive side consumers seemed very 
aware of the terms of their policies and often made an effort to 
examine their bills 
however consumers were also likely to turn to practitioners when 
they had doubts about their bills he said 
thats like being kidnapped and then asking the person who 
kidnapped you whether he really meant it garcia said 
to counter that garcia said aetna plans to introduce a fraud hot 
line 
were going to try to make it as easy as possible for consumers 
to notify the insurance agency he said 
the survey found that consumers consider healthcare insurance 
fraud among the most serious forms of whitecollar crime only stock 
market insider trading was considered more severe 
and a majority of the respondents 55 percent said practitioners 
found guilty of fraud should have their licenses either suspended or 
revoked 
however respondents to the survey ranked healthcare insurance 
fraud fifth when they were asked why medical costs and insurance 
premiums have risen over the last several years 
eightyfour percent of those responding said they thought 
malpractice suits and the cost of malpractice insurance were 
responsible for the increased costs and 53 percent blamed insurance 
companies for causing the increases by seeking to increase their own 
profits 
the cost of new technology and general inflation were both cited 
by 51 percent followed by health care insurance fraud blamed by 47 
percent of the respondents 
national family opinion conducted the survey for aetna by mailing 
a fourpage questionnaire to 1000 households in august a total of 
705 people responded giving the survey a margin of error of plus or 
minus 5 percent 
of those who responded 91 percent said they had some form of 
health insurance and 24 percent said they were covered by medicare 
of medicaid

decline gmac said

841 percent in the third quarter up from with 789 percent in the 
same period last year

ford motor co reported record 
thirdquarter earnings wednesday and enhanced its reputation as the 
most profitable automaker in the country although the performance 
of us operations declined 
the no 2 vehicle producer behind general motors corp earned 
8563 million or 178 a share in the three months ended sept 30 
vs 7032 million or 138 a share a year earlier a 217 percent 
gain that made it the best third quarter in fords history 
thirdquarter sales totaled 1773 billion vs 1525 billion a 
151 percent gain 
in the prior four quarters ford outearned much larger gm the 
biggest us automaker and no 3 chrysler corp were expected to 
report thirdquarter earnings thursday 
industry analysts anticipated ford would continue its string of 
impressive earnings gains for each of the past ten quarters ford 
has set new earnings records for itself 
my guess is that they will earn 13 billion or 14 billion 
in the fourth quarter said david healy who follows the industry 
for drexel burnham lambert inc in 1987 it was a little over 900 
million so it looks like the next quarter will be up again 
easily 
despite the earnings outlook fords stock price fell 87 cents a 
share to 5312 on the new york stock exchange 
thirdquarter auto company earnings usually are lower than other 
quarters because of factory retooling to gear up for the new model 
year which historically has started oct 1 
ford said earnings this past quarter were based largely on strong 
overseas sales and not its us business 
we do have a declining profit margin in the united states and 
thats been the case all year said david mccammon fords vice 
president for finance and treasurer the overseas margin has been 
increasing because of outstanding results this year in europe and 
also latin america has come back substantially 
he pointed to fords performance in mexico and with autolatina a 
joint venture with volkswagen ag in brazil and argentina ford owns 
49 percent of autolatina and mccammon declined to be specific about 
its results 
however he said autolatina went from a substantial loss in 
the last third quarter to a profit this quarter 
analyst ron glantz of montgomery securities inc of san francisco 
said i estimate autolatina earned 70 million this quarter 
versus a loss of 56 million last quarter 
overall ford said it earned 384 million from overseas 
operations in the third quarter of 1988 up 249 percent from the 
110 million earned overseas during the period last year 
in the united states the company earned 472 million in the 
third quarter down 204 percent from the 593 million earned a year 
earlier 
because of the depressed us results profit sharing for 
unionized workers will decline this year compared with last 
mccammon said although he wasnt specific mccammon said it would 
fall somewhere between the 3700 average per worker in 1987 and the 
2100 average the year before 
mccammon blamed much of the us decline on development of new 
products lower earnings by the companys financial services group 
and a problem with what kinds of cars were available 
he said that during the quarter the company produced 30 percent 
fewer highprofit thunderbirds than a year earlier while making 
more ford tempos and mercury topazes which carry less of a percar 
profit 
healy agreed saying the cost of everything they buy is up so 
that and the shutdown of the tbird and cougar had an effect on 
their earnings for the us 
the financial services group which includes ford credit first 
nationwide us leasing and the companys international credit 
operations added 35 cents per share to thirdquarter earnings 146 
percent less than the group contributed during the third quarter of 
last year 
the company said benefits from a lower tax rate and increased 
billings were offset by lower earnings at ford credit and first 
nationwide 
for the first nine months of the year ford earned 41 billion 
or 853 a share up 122 percent from earnings of 37 billion or 
717 a share a year earlier sales totaled 609 billion vs 529 
billion a 151 percent gain

the dollar fell wednesday to its lowest point 
since late june as traders reacted to a report of unexpectedly 
modest growth in the us economy gold prices rose 
slower growth reduces the chance that the federal reserve will 
raise interest rates to cool off inflation analysts said lower 
us rates would reduce demand for dollars 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of the economy grew at a 22 percent annual rate 
in the third quarter the market had forecast a 3 percent to 35 
percent rise 
the gnp advance down from increases of 34 percent in the first 
quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year was the 
smallest rise since a 14 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 
1986 
what this does is bring us closer to potentially lower interest 
rates said craig sloane a currency analyst at smith barney 
harris upham amp co 
the currency markets reaction to the gnp report was unusually 
strong partly because the market was prepared to drive the dollar 
down anyway traders said 
in contrast the bond market which usually rallies at signs of 
slower growth posted only a modest increase 
in tokyo before the report was released the dollar eased 007 
japanese yen to a closing 12680 yen later in london after the 
reports release it dropped to 12585 yen in new york the dollar 
fell to 12571 yen from 12680 yen tuesday 
the dollar also fell against the british pound it cost 17600 
to buy one pound in late london trading more expensive than 17535 
late tuesday the pound rose to 17610 in new york from 17515

the proposed 22 billion merger between 
pacificorp and utah power amp light was approved wednesday by the 
federal energy regulatory commission but only on the condition that 
the new company provide space on its transmission lines for other 
utilities to ship electricity 
in a 70page order the commission said requirements that the 
merged company wheel electricity from other utilities were aimed 
at alleviating fears it would dominate the sale of power from the 
inland northwest to the southwest 
we believe that the conditions are the minimum necessary to 
alleviate these likely anticompetitive effects so as to make the 
merger consistent with the public interest the commission said 
the merger would create the nations 13th largest utility serving 
more than 12 million customers in seven western states 
california washington oregon montana idaho wyoming and utah 
the commissions handling of the case has been closely watched by 
the utility industry which has been swept by talk over the last 
several years of deregulation and increased competition 
the commission in its order asserted its right to condition a 
merger so that it would be consistent with the public interest 
and found that without imposing conditions in this case the merger 
would enhance the ability of the new company to exercise 
monopoly power 
the commission ordered that in the shortterm the new company 
must set aside a portion of its transmission line capacity for 
others to use 
in the longterm the commission said the new company had an 
absolute obligation to provide transmission service to any 
utility that makes a bona fide request even if that means the 
company has to build new transmission facilities 
the directors of both pacificorp and utah power are expected to 
meet early next week to decide whether to proceed with the proposed 
merger the companies have 60 days to notify ferc of their decision 
or they can request a rehearing 
we need to satisfy ourselves that conditions imposed on the 
merged company will not materially impair our ability to acheive the 
customer and shareholder benefits we expect as a result of the 
combination david bolander president of pacificorps utility 
subsidiary pacific power amp light said in a statement 
patrick slattery a pacific power spokesman said that the 
company was somewhat surprised by the conditions imposed by the 
commission 
they appear to be unlike anything we have seen before said 
slattery it will take some time to get a firm grip on what the 
implications are 
shareholders of pacificorp based in portland ore and utah 
power based in salt lake city along with regulatory agencies in 
each of the states and the department of justice and federal trade 
commission have raised no objections to the merger 
but almost two dozen public and private utilities and utility 
organizations stretching from arizona to south dakota opposed the 
merger fearing it would create a megautility that would dominate 
western energy markets 
in june a ferc administrative law judge had recommended 
rejection of the proposed merger because of the impact it might have 
on utility competition 
pacificorp and utah power officials have said the merger could 
result in annual savings of up to 150 million over the first five 
years stable rates for pacific power customers and a drop in rates 
of up to 10 percent for utah power customers 
pacific power and light currently serves about 670000 customers 
in oregon washington california montana idaho and wyoming 
utah power has about 510000 customers in utah wyoming and idaho

canadas varity corp has halted talks on the 
possible acquisition of fruehauf corp and the troubled 
detroitbased truckmaker said wednesday it would explore other 
options 
fruehauf reported a net loss of 415 million on sales of 184 
billion in 1987 
varity spokesman jr nowling said he didnt expect further 
efforts to acquire fruehauf though he didnt rule out discussions 
about its kelseyhayes automotive subsidiary 
fruehauf has struggled with large debts high interest payments 
and operating losses in its trailer and maritime operations since 
managers took control of the company in december 1986 with huge 
borrowings in a financial transaction known as a leveraged buyout 
fruehauf will continue to explore alternatives including 
disposition of all or part of kelseyhayes its only profitable 
unit fruehauf spokesman david hladik said 
hladik said he knew of no specific suitors but even during 
discussions with varity we never closed the door to other 
offers 
formerly called masseyferguson torontobased varity makes farm 
and industrial machinery fruehauf makes truck trailers and 
automotive and maritime products 
varity ended discussions with fruehauf after a review of 
fruehaufs records and assets nowling said 
he declined to elaborate on reasons asked if varity will enter 
further negotiations for fruehauf he said i wouldnt think so 
nowling said he didnt know if talks were likely regarding 
kelseyhayes which makes auto and truck and industrial parts and is 
a leading supplier of antilock brake systems 
but he said we announced when we initiated discussions in 
august that kelseyhayes was our primary interest

petroleum futures prices finished mostly higher wednesday 
following a tumultuous day of trading set off by a report showing a 
sharp drawdown in gasoline reserves and higher demand levels 
in other markets livestock and pork futures fell grain and 
soybean futures rebounded slightly after declining for four straight 
sessions and precious metals were mixed in featureless trading 
gasoline stocks were considered to be the wild card in an 
american petroleum institute report released after the markets had 
closed tuesday the api report showed gasoline stocks fell by more 
than 3 million barrels almost twice what some analysts expected 
that coupled with a rising demand for the product pushed the 
price of unleaded gas to 5450 cents a gallon at one point on the 
new york mercantile exchange 
were seeing demand of about 8 million barrels a day and weve 
only seen that six or seven times in the last two years and not 
at all during the period from the late 70s until 1986 said peter 
beutel assistant director of elders futures energy group in new 
york 
we are back in the land of preconservation demand 
still many traders apparently believe gasoline may be near its 
peak for the short term not only was there significant 
profittaking wednesday but many traders elected to reverse 
previous positions selling gasoline and buying heating oil 
what you saw was everybody heading for the door at the same 
time said jim ritterbusch a vice president at carson petroleum 
co in chicago and the catalyst that set this in motion was the 
fact that gasoline appeared so strong 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 19 cents 
higher at the new york mercantile exchange with the december 
contract at 1341 heating oil was 23 cent to 124 cents higher 
with november at 415 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 35 
cent lower to 20 cent higher with november at 5167 cents a gallon 
both livestock and meat futures were lower at the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
pork futures were clobbered by a report released late tuesday 
that indicated the number of frozen pork bellies stored in 
warehouses was the secondlargest ever reported during october 
that put a bearish shroud over everything on the floor said 
chuck levitt of shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
cattle prices are suffering from a small pocket of heavyweight 
cattle hanging over the market for the moment he continued 
they should have moved earlier this summer but it will only take 
a short while for them to get cleaned up and supplies to get tight 
again 
live cattle settled 25 cent to 85 cent lower with december at 
7390 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 78 cent lower 
with october at 8142 cents a pound live hogs were 30 cent to 102 
cents lower with december at 4127 cents a pound and frozen pork 
bellies were 158 cents to 2 cents lower with february at 4950 
cents a pound 
analysts said the grain market was in need of fresh news and 
none was forthcoming wednesday but declining prices fueled ideas of 
renewed export bnusiness and helped lay the groundwork for a modest 
rally 
wheat futures got some support from a us department of 
agriculture report that india would purchase 1 million tons under 
the export bonus program the notion that lower prices would 
stimulate export business nudged prices ahead in the surrounding 
pits 
wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with december contract 
at 409 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with december 
at 276 a bushel oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher with 
december at 236 a bushel and soybeans were 6 cents lower to 4 
cents higher with november at 761 a bushel 
precious metals meanwhile finished the day mixed after holding 
to a narrow range at the new york commodity exchange 
prices moved to session highs early when the us dollar fell 
because of a lowerthanexpected 22 percent rise in the 
thirdquarter gross national product 
but the lack of followthrough buying as well the interpretation 
that the inflation indicators were not as strong as anticipated 
sent the metals drifiting 
gold settled 150 to 190 higher with october at 40830 a 
troy ounce silver was unchanged to 3 cents hgher with october at 
6224 cents a troy ounce 
platinum traded on the new york mercantile exchange settled 60 
cents lower to 10 cents higher with october at 53640 a troy ounce

takeover target west pointpepperell inc has 
adopted a sweetened severance plan for almost 6000 employees that 
provides increased benefits if they are fired within two years of a 
hostile acquisition 
a company official said wednesday the plan has been considered 
for some time and is not a direct reaction to this weeks 14 
billion bid for the west georgia textile giant 
chicagobased farley inc one of the nations largest privately 
owned conglomerates monday announced a 48pershare tender offer 
for pepperell stock west pointpepperell the nations largest 
publicly owned textile and apparel company has not responded 
advising stockholders to await a board recommendation that is 
promised by next week 
however employees were informed of the severance program 
tuesday d michael roark west pointpepperell vice president of 
human resources said wednesday the program had been adopted last 
week and was under consideration for some time 
this is not something we did in response to bill farley 
roark said william farley heads the conglomerate which owns 
underwear manufacturer fruit of the loom and other companies 
we had been talking about the plan in the management group 
for several months roark said in a telephone interview from the 
companys west point ga headquarters 
this was not and we dont now consider it shark repellent 
he said referring to jargon used to describe tactics companies 
use to fend off corporate raiders 
a farley spokesman said the company would have no comment on the 
provision 
roark said the plan which guarantees at least threemonths pay 
to some 5900 salaried and clerical employees would not involve 
enough money to dissuade a suitor however he had no estimate on 
the amount of money involved saying it would depend on how many 
employees were involved and their level of seniority 
the decision however fits in with a series of moves west 
pointpepperell has taken this year to strengthen its ability to 
fight a takeover 
in june the company adopted a shareholder rights plan which 
would allow the board to issue a special class of stock as a 
dividend to current stockholders the plan would take effect as soon 
as a tender offer is launched or if someone purchases 10 percent of 
its stock 
farley notified the company in may it was seeking up to 25 
percent of west pointpepperell stock and so far has spent 88 
million for 98 percent of the stock 
pepperell also has had in place for some time socalled golden 
parachutes for executives including a 139 million payout to 
chief executive officer joseph l lanier jr if he were to be fired 
by new owners 
those provisions have been challenged by farley in federal court 
and by a pepperell stockholder who filed a suit in state superior 
court tuesday claiming stockholders are deprived of the highest 
possible stock price 
no action has been taken on either lawsuit 
west pointpepperell is one of the first companies in the state 
to take advantage of a new state antitakeover law adopted earlier 
this year and patterned after similar laws in other states 
the law which took effect in march limits a new owners ability 
to sell off parts of the company for five years 
the severance plan covers all salaried and certain skilled 
clerical workers who roark said in other places in the country 
likely would be salaried workers 
if within two years of a change of control an employee covered 
by the plan is terminated they would receive the greater of two 
weeks pay per year of service or three months pay roark said 
it institutionalizes the sort of severance payment that we 
consider fair and reasonable in any event its about what we do 
now he said 
we felt that is was important that if we did change control 
some provision be in place to insure that employees were treated 
as fair by the new management as we would

grand metropolitan plc is considering appealing a federal judges 
dismissal of its suit to strike down an arizona law that would bar 
its proposed 52 billion buyout of pillsbury co an attorney for 
grand met said wednesday 
us district judge roger strand in phoenix also has denied grand 
mets motion for a preliminary injunction to bar enforcement of the 
arizona state takeover law in the deal 
strand on monday dismissed grand mets oct 4 lawsuit that 
contended the arizona law barring outofstate takeovers of arizona 
businesses holding liquor licenses was illegal because it improperly 
hindered interstate commerce and infringed on federal authority over 
interstate securities dealings 
businesses owned by pillsbury the nations fourthlargest food 
company includ the bennigans and steak and ale chains 
bennigans has restaurants in phoenix and mesa and because the 
restaurants have liquor licenses the state liquor control 
superintendant must approve any takeover of them by an outofstate 
company 
strand said the federal courts should defer to the state courts 
when action at that level is pending important state interests are 
involved and the state proceedings provided an adequate 
opportunity to raise the federal questions 
philip j macdonnell a phoenix lawyer representing grand 
metropolitan said the company was considering an appeal of strands 
decision 
grand metropolitan one of the worlds biggest producers of 
spirits has said it would sell off pillsburys steak amp ale and 
bennigans restaurants because of laws in a number of states 
prohibiting a liquor producer from owning retail liquor outlets 
grand met filed its suit the same day it offered to buy pillsbury 
for 60 a share pillsbury since then has rejected the offer as 
inadequate and indicated it would present its shareholders with an 
alternative to the british food liquor and real estate conglomerate 
by next tuesday 
pillsbury stock closed at 6062 up 150 a share from 
tuesdays close on wednesday in new york stock exchange trading 
the minneapolisbased companys board of directors reportedly met 
on wednesday although pillsbury declined to comment on the reports 
and johnny thompson pillsburys vice president of public relations 
said the company had nothing to announce 
pillsbury also filed a lawsuit oct 4 in maricopa county 
superior court claiming grand metropolitans takeover attempt 
should be blocked because it violates arizonas acquisition of 
control act 
joseph e mais jr a phoenix lawyer representing pillsbury said 
wednesday that he expects both sides to file motions quickly in the 
state case but nothing had been scheduled

fuller died monday of kidney failure in st francis hospital in 
suburban blue island

fuller products co spokesman 
at its peak in the 1960s fuller products co included 
newspapers appliance outlets and department stores as well as

annually and sales offices in 38 states the company lost business 
the 1960s however to boycotts by white supremecists and also by
