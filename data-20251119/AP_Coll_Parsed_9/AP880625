the polk county sheriffs office is making 
its own crack these days having decided it is a safer and more 
efficient way to supply its undercover agents for sales to drug 
buyers 
while most law enforcement agencies use crack confiscated during 
investigations for undercover operations polk officials decided 
they needed more than the very limited supply of crack they had 
on hand a department report said 
in addition there were worries about impurities sometimes found 
in confiscated crack 
turning powder cocaine into crack cocaine requires a powdery 
base substance as well as the drug some dealers have been known to 
use drano or other toxic chemicals as the base sheriffs lt james 
madden said recently 
after reviewing all our options and checking with other 
agencies in the state that are taking an aggressive approach to 
crack we felt the safest and most reliable way to handle these 
reverses would be use crack that was produced in a clean 
controlled environment the report said 
polk county deputies posing as drug dealers have routinely set 
up shop in known drug neighborhoods and sold crack to drug buyers 
in cars deputies have made more than 600 reversesting arrests 
since the campaign began in earnest last fall 
the sheriffs office crack was made at the department by a 
supervisor in the drug unit who had gone over the fairly simple 
cooking procedure with technicians from the florida department of 
law enforcement baking powder was used as a base substance 
the cooking session produced 11 ounces enough to make several 
thousand pieces of crack in the size commonly sold on the street 
officials said

looking for a unique setting to exchange vows 
how about an old pier complete with dramatic view of the city a 
gentle lake breeze and a couple of fishermen and joggers thrown in 
for charm 
the citys marriage bureau offers the service at navy pier on 
lake michigan as an alternative to the mundane civil ceremony at 
city hall 
the 10 price wont hurt the wallet much and the view is almost 
guaranteed to take the wedding partys breath away 
a judge from circuit court marries the couples its like 
getting married at the city hall only you get married at lovely 
navy pier said susan wayman who coordinates the weddings for 
the department of cultural affairs 
you can be as elaborate as you want within reason ms 
wayman said friday 
ive seen six bridesmaids and flower girls at one wedding 
she said ive seen couples arrive by horse and carriage and 
a lot of people walk out just casually dressed it runs the gamut 
the pier which once was bustling with great lakes shippers is 
frequented by athletes and anglers so couples who marry there 
should be prepared for fishermen sitting right next to them 
and joggers jogging right by ms wayman said

from a distance theres no telling 
sign that the noisy children and teenagers romping around a summer 
camp share the deep emotional and physical scars that accompany 
disfiguring burns 
we try to give them a whole week to be free of their burn 
said shirley turner who heads the special camp 
its called wonder valley ranch this secluded spot nestled in 
the sierra nevada mountains 200 miles southeast of san francisco 
this week 77 young burn survivors from mexico to washington state 
frolicked in a swimming pool rode ponies or cast a fishing line 
into a trout pond 
if my mom wouldnt have taken me i would have walked here 
declared david an 11yearold enjoying the camp sponsored by the 
alisa ann ruch california burn foundation the counselors are 
real cool they treat you really nice 
mrs turner the foundations executive director described the 
camp as therapy to help fortify a burn victims selfesteem most 
important it lets them simply be kids free from a society too 
often repelled by the disfigurement of burns 
there is one strict rule no one can ask the children about 
their accident 
thats why camp is so good for them they dont have to deal 
with the accident said mrs turner we dont want them 
reliving that 
the children splashing in the pool on a hot summer morning 
played as if they never had endured painful skin grafts worn an 
uncomfortable pressure garment to reduce swelling or been cruelly 
teased by peers 
as corky and cecily splashed around corky stretched her scarred 
arm around cecilys back proclaiming with a wide smile were 
friends 
mrs turners husband jim a los angeles county firefighter and 
foundation member said theres little reluctance among these 
summer campers to test new experiences 
theyve been through so much pain theyll try anything 
turner said 
the camp is rewarding for the volunteer counselors mostly 
firefighters and their spouses 
if you come up here for a week you get enough hugs and kisses 
to last a year said nan ziegler a nurse from long beach 
i love them they are just little kids they can forget what 
they look like said christen powell a lifeguard from clovis 
im going to miss these kids 
mrs turner said such a loving and accepting environment isnt 
typical for burn survivors society is wary of burn victims she 
said some gawk at a survivors blistered and grafted skin while 
others treat them like pariahs she told of an incident of a 
restaurant owner asking a family to leave because the sight of 
their child a burn victim made his patrons uncomfortable 
these experiences along with the fact that many burn victims 
remain physically scarred for life add up to a devastating 
psychological effect on the victims and their families mrs turner 
said easing such trauma is one of the foundations goals 
now that doctors have solved the major medical problems and 
are able to keep them alive they are now concentrating on the 
quality of life she said 
she estimated that 4000 children are seriously burned in 
california each year 
all expenses for the children at the camp are paid by the 
foundations fundraising efforts and volunteer labor mrs turner 
estimated that the week in wonder valley which ends with a trip to 
disneyland cost the group about 100000 
judging by the the childrens grins it appeared to be money 
well spent 
today and this week they are just kids said mrs turner 
she said she hopes the camp will help make them strong enough 
inside to take and handle the pressures their peers and adults give 
them

author robert daley knows that the 
quick grip of fear and splitsecond decisions that can make or 
break a cops career are not just the stuff of police fiction 
a former deputy commissioner of the new york city police 
department daley has grabbed the attention of readers on subjects 
ranging from treasure diving in florida to bullfighting in spain 
but is best known for his insiders tales of street crime and 
police bureaucracy 
during an interview at the converted cottage on his ridgefield 
estate where he does his writing the bestselling author of year 
of a dragon hands of a stranger and prince of the city 
explained how fact and fantasy merge in his latest novel man 
with a gun simon amp schuster 1995 
most of the incidents happened to me one way or the other but 
they didnt happen just that way daley said all of them have 
been extracted from the way they actually happened and moved 
together to make a story 
the story of man with a gun is loosely based on events 
surrounding the harlem mosque murder of 1972 when a police officer 
was killed during a confrontation between black muslims and 
authorities the book deals with the power and politics behind the 
police handling of a situation where every decision has longterm 
consequences 
in moments of terror you do what it seems like you have to do 
and no one is responsible for that daley said 
i made some mistakes which didnt seem like mistakes at the 
time he said of his involvement in the mosque riots 
daley and the central character in man with a gun phillip 
keefe are alike in many ways keefe is a deputy police 
commissioner and like daley resigns after the incident keefe is 
a former journalist daley worked for five years as a foreign 
correspondent for the new york times keefe drives a porsche so 
does daley 
however keefe is not daley the author insists i have no 
ghosts to exorcise 
for one thing keefe is not a successful author daley has 20 
books to his credit five novels have been made into films and 
paul newman is slated to play the lead role in man with a gun 
in his novels the 57yearold daley aims to provide more than a 
mirror image of life literature should provide new insights into 
your own life into everybodys life a new understanding of what 
we are all up against he said 
novels about the police however tend to be grouped together as 
thrillers said daley who considers thrillers to be books with 
preposterous characters doing preposterous acts all the time 
thriller means discardable thriller means light 
entertainment thriller means not important he said the word 
denigrates what i am trying to do i think i am writing something 
else and keep getting accused of writing thrillers 
as an undergraduate studying literature at fordham university 
daley said he wanted to be the greatest writer that ever lived he 
has since lowered his goal to writing books that will stand the 
test of time 
translations of daleys books cram his closets i cant throw 
them away because they are books and books are icons samples of 
his photographic work decorate his walls 
daley bought a camera when the new york times offered to pay him 
15 extra for every photograph used in the newspaper his 
photographs have since been exhibited at the baltimore museum the 
art institute in chicago and the new york gallery of modern art 
but he prefers writing 
to me literature is the greatest of the arts because it takes 
you further outside yourself than any other he said adding 
theres also a practical side to his work i dont want to be 
poor i wouldnt give up the things we have in order to be a 
renowned writer that no one ever reads he keeps apartments in 
france and new york as well as his connecticut home where he lives 
with his wife 
currently working on a part personal memoir part history of 
france daley said he considers the time spent writing the book 
as a rest period from the pressures of producing what is expected 
of him 
i have to write something thats going to sell he said 
you get trapped in whatever it is that you are doing thats 
successful

a french judge has prohibited a private television 
station from broadcasting a colorized version of asphalt 
jungle a classic john huston film 
the ruling friday was the first of its kind in france 
lawyers for the station la cinq channel 5 said they would 
appeal the colorized version of the 1950 film had been scheduled 
to run sunday night 
judge huguette le foyer de costil said the ruling affected all 
of hustons films she noted that huston who died in august 
opposed colorization and it was her duty to respect his will 
the french society of film directors which representives of 
hustons estate in france had requested the injunction 
we hope the first blow to the colorizers will put a 
definitive stop to the surge of profiteering against creativity 
the group said in a news release 
huston was so vehemently opposed to the tinting of his films 
that he attended a news conference denouncing the process not long 
before his death 
a spokeswoman for la cinq said the station had aired colorized 
films previously but none in which the authors had expressed their 
disapproval 
french laws protecting the control by artists of their works are 
among the strongest in europe but it has no specific legislation 
dealing with colorization

europe has its arms scandals but the 
kind that has shaken washington is unlikely because procurement 
programs are run differently and governments generally avoid direct 
competition among contractors 
in washington a 2yearold investigation has focused on 
allegations that private consultants bribed government employees to 
obtain pentagon secrets that could help their clients win huge 
contracts 
proportion alone is a significant factor in the relative 
opportunity for corruption nothing in europe even approaches the 
colossus of the us defense budget 290 billion for 1988 
sweden and norway respective recent budgets of about 4 
billion and 28 billion have had scandals recently but they 
involved bribery and illegal exports both scandinavian are 
considering measures to control their arms traders 
even britain france and west germany spend only onetenth the 
amount of money on defense that goes through the pentagon funnel 
every year 
the giant british marconi communications group currently is the 
object of a yearlong fraud investigation but defense scandals in 
europe seldom are publicized the marconi case is based on 
suspicions that the company made excessive profits and did not pay 
royalties it owed the government 
italy had a major bribery scandal a decade ago in which a former 
defense minister and an air force chief were convicted of accepting 
payoffs from lockheed the us aircraft manufacturer 
in west germany franz josef strauss was accused of taking 
millions from from lockheed when he was defense minister in 1961 
but the case was dropped 
the europeans deal with these things differently they dont 
want to know about them said aaron karp an american who tracks 
worldwide weapons sales for sipri the stockholm international 
peace research institute 
all over europe the procurement networks are much smaller than 
in the united states he said there are real oldboy networks 
here the europeans are very hesitant to prosecute people on 
the team 
david greenwood said european governments seldom use middlemen 
on contracts and most weapons come from preferred sources that 
coordinate development programs with defense ministries 
greenwood a professor at aberdeen university in scotland said 
in an interview that european governments and companies have 
almost a symbiotic relationship and few secrets from each other 
lack of competition sometimes bloats prices londons guardian 
newspaper said recently parliaments public accounts committee has 
complained to the defense ministry for years about unsatisfactory 
administration and a disturbing failure to control costs 
karp said corruption is hard to pin down in european 
procurements but some armaments in europe are three or four times 
the price of comparable us weapons systems 
europeans expect to pay more and they accept that its the 
price they pay to keep their independence from the united states 
he said 
according to greenwood the key difference with the americans 
is that in europe until recently you didnt have consultants the 
beltway bandits or people who are hungry for contracts 
frances defense ministry controls 15 percent of the national 
arms production and the government has a share in companies that 
handle about half the rest a ministry spokesman said 
supervision of arms sales in europe is handled by government 
agencies sometimes by parliaments italy has no oversight process 
said a spokesman for the prime ministers office 
when corruption occurs in the european arms trade it usually 
involves export sales especially to third world countries 
bofors ab the privately owned swedish munitions company is 
accused of paying 50 million in bribes and commissions to get a 
24 billion artillery contract from india 
some of the money allegedly found its way to prime minister 
rajiv gandhis congress party spawning charges in new delhi of 
government corruption 
for deals in many parts of the world bribery payments are 
incorporated in to the prices of weapons two sources said 
privately 
one a retired swedish salesman of defense equipment said of 
india it was taken for granted that you cant secure an arms 
deal without bribes 
bofors the largest arms maker in sweden also is accused of 
circumventing rules against selling weapons to nations that are at 
war or located in volatile regions the rules are meant to 
safeguard swedish neutrality 
four former bofors executives were indicted this week on charges 
of smuggling antiaircraft missile systems to dubai and bahrain in 
the persian gulf where iran and iraq are at war none was accused 
of profiting personally 
prime minister ingvar carlsson threatened to halt all arms 
exports unless the companies follow the regulations 
kongsberg vapenfabrikk norways largest defense contractor 
admitted violating western export controls by selling equipment to 
the soviet union that would enable it to built quieter submarines 
the deal revealed last year led to a public apology from prime 
minister gro harlem brundtland to president reagan

before glasnost school no 734 would have looked 
like this 17yearolds lined up in the hall in the summer heat 
nervously awaiting a grilling on soviet politics and history by a 
panel of teachers 
thats what lanky blondhaired dmitri predkov and his 
classmates at the school in eastern moscow had been expecting 
friday but last month the head of soviet education gennady a 
yagodin suddenly ordered the tests canceled 
the reason the final exams would have made students in the 
final year of school parrot material in textbooks now contradicted 
by the revelations of mikhail s gorbachevs drive for more 
openness in history and other areas 
instead dmitri and his 24 classmates like 10th graders 
nationwide were called into school for a threehour ungraded 
discussion to gauge their knowledge of the past and awareness 
of problems facing the soviet union today 
we want to be sure that the children can take part in 
discussions and are able to to voice their opinion anywhere said 
their teacher vera f zorich 53 
despite that wish most of the teenage muscovites who gathered 
at 9 am friday around four tables in a geography classroom said 
nothing during the ensuing discussion despite repeated 
prompting from teachers 
some however aired views at odds with official ideology and 
that presumably would have gotten them into trouble only a few 
years ago one even joked about the russian revolution 
predkov stood up to say that gorbachevs program for 
perestroika or economic and social restructuring was not a 
natural consequence of the growth of soviet socialism and that 
people who say otherwise do so only because gorbachev is the head 
of our party 
we dont have any rights theyre just words on paper 
declared the son of a building engineer 
glasnost dmitri added may allow more candor about history but 
it doesnt mean soviet citizens are getting more information about 
current political problems 
another 17yearold wearing a thin black tie said soviets of 
all schools of thought even fascists should have the legal 
right to form their own political parties to challenge the 
communist party that gorbachev heads 
gennady kaztman whose father works as a printer made his 
classmates and teachers roar with laughter by telling this 
bittersweet joke about the legacy of the 1917 russian revolution 
when the bolsheviks seized power gennady said a russian 
countess whose grandfather had been a 19thcentury revolutionary 
summoned her maid to see what the shouting in the streets was about 
why madame its the revolution the maid replied 
oh yes grandfather dreamed of that tell me what do they 
want the countess asked 
why they want a society where there are no more rich people 
strange the countess replied grandfather wanted a 
society where there were no more poor people 
four years ago maybe even a year ago they would not have 
dared speak like that a beaming mrs zorich told a visiting 
reporter at the end of the meeting 
in recent months soviet educators and official media have 
heaped scorn on the countrys history textbooks which have been 
outpaced by criticism in the glasnostrevitalized media about the 
crimes of dictator josef v stalin and corruption and stagnation 
under leonid i brezhnev 
frankly the books are of the hooray type said tatyana 
cherkashena head of teaching methods in the moscow neighborhood 
where school no 734 is located in our country they say 
everything is wonderful hooray those who perished in the 
repressions those who were imprisoned are not even mentioned 
a recent competition was held to select a new generation of 
soviet textbooks but it is uncertain whether they will be ready 
for the next school year in september in the meantime many soviet 
teachers have been using articles published in the press as the 
basis for their history lessons 
in years past 10th grade students taking their final exams were 
given a slip of paper that bore two questions on history and 
civics after a halfhour or more to prepare they were called 
before a panel of teachers to speak and answer questions 
in may the principal of school 734 alexander n tubelsky was 
informed by the state committee on education that the customary 
yearend history exams for senior school pupils had been canceled 
we werent told about how to structure the discussions so we 
decided to use the regular form of our history class which the 
students would feel comfortable with tubelsky said 
we need to change out textbooks he added they are based 
on a stalinist conception that sees every event every historical 
figure through the dogma of class warfare

these days this east river enclave is a 
magnet for peace marchers buddhist monks nigerian drummers of 
passion victims of hiroshima poets and blues singers of the 
nuclear age 
all have converged on the third special session on disarmament 
a monthlong gathering ending this week 
they have camped on the sidewalks and exploded 1000 balloons to 
symbolize nuclear tests they have gathered at a corner coffee shop 
to discuss radioactive military landfills the evils of 
transnational corporations and the future of the siberian crane 
they range from a 12yearold california girl who invented a 
peace game to mother teresa the 77yearold nobel laureate 
but all the spinning of prayer wheels scattering of flower 
petals chanting of mantras and meditation on brotherhood have not 
harmonized discordant views on disarmament 
the 159 un members are trying to devise a realistic agenda for 
peace and delegates hope theyll be able to adopt a final document 
by concensus without divisive voting that usually pits the united 
states against most of the developing world and socialist countries 
the superpower backdrop is positive the moscow summit the 
soviet pullout from afghanistan and the treaty on elimination of 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
but differences over such issues as nuclear and conventional 
disarmament and a nuclear test ban treaty are enormous 
the united states has made clear it will not reaffirm what it 
calls a sweeping and unrealistic un disarmament document adopted 
10 years ago 
last year the united states voted alone on most disarmament 
issues in the general assembly ranging from a demand for a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban to prohibiting the military uses of 
outer space 
it refused to participate in a conference on the relationship 
between disarmament and development 
third world nations have been clamoring for a disarmament fund 
of military savings in the industrialized world to be diverted 
toward economic and social development in poor countries 
western diplomats say that the developing world should do its 
part by halting its regional wars and curbing its massive spending 
on conventional arms spending that deprives people of food 
health care and education 
the american positions have not changed in the current 
disarmament session 
the us administration and western allies emphasize the 
importance of bilateral negotiations with the soviet union in 
nuclear and other fields and do not want bilateral talks subject to 
multilateral pressures 
we are hearing a lot of cant said one western diplomat 
the us and the soviets are doing just fine what we need is a 
realistic approach that will leave nations free to pursue their 
bilateral actions without multilateral interference 
at this session the soviet union is a major player and is seen 
far more than the united states as a team player in the world body 
the soviet union has been calling for a larger and more powerful 
role for the united nations in multilateral arms negotiations 
disarmament verification and monitoring expanded peacekeeping 
operations and crisis management it has called for a new un 
naval peacekeeping force and un space agency 
but the united states more than 400 million in arrears in un 
dues doesnt want to see expanded un operations infringe on 
traditional areas of national prerogative 
eduard a shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister unfurled a 
sweeping blueprint of disarmament proposals and in a grand gesture 
invited the un secretarygeneral security council and nonaligned 
leaders to attend the first soviet destruction of 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
the first and perhaps the hardest thing to do shevardnadze 
said is to abandon the myth of nuclear weapons as the guarantor 
of peace we are convinced that ensuring security by nonnuclear 
means is possible 
the speech initially was praised by us ambassador vernon a 
walters as constructive and deserving of study but us officials 
have not responded to specific proposals such as a permanent 
moratorium on nuclear testing slashing conventional armies in 
europe by 500000 soldiers each and announcement of port calls by 
warships with or without nuclear arms 
secretary of state george p shultz outlined the standard us 
positions he emphasized the dangers of proliferation in nuclear 
conventional ballistic chemical and other weapons and cited the 
dangers of the iraniraq war and the rivalry between india and 
pakistan 
he did not mention the soviet proposals 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe sounded the theme of 
nuclear deterrence considered anathema to most un delegates 
it may be that one day we shall find a better way to prevent war 
than through nuclear deterrence he told the general assembly 
but to suggest that between east and west such an alternative is 
within reach is to deny reality 
meanwhile 12yearold michelle robyn alexander of fresno 
calif was promoting her game give peace a chance and saying 
her dream was to play it with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
she said she still was waiting for a white house response

unaccredited workers botched asbestos removal at 
a high school and exposed students to cancercausing fibers the 
us environmental protection agency charged friday in its first 
enforcement of new regulations 
the agency which proposed a 5000 fine said 6400 square feet 
of asbestoscontaining floor tiles were improperly removed in 
february from a hallway at thornton township high school in 
suburban harvey 
workers who were not accredited by the epa had sanded chipped 
and cut the tiles releasing clouds of dust containing asbestos 
the agency said in a statement 
the district overseeing the school in southwest suburban harvey 
failed to post signs and restrict the affected area to only those 
persons necessary to do tile removal and cleanup the epa said 
school officials have until july 11 to respond to the complaint 
they can either seek an informal hearing with epa officials in 
chicago or request a hearing before a federal administrative law 
judge epa spokeswoman nancy sullivan said 
the school was closed friday afternoon and officials could not 
be reached for comment 
ms sullivan said school officials did not know the tiles 
contained asbestos when the removal began but suspected they might 
and ordered tests 
the epa called the complaint its first enforcement action 
nationwide under last years asbestos hazard emergency response 
act which specifies procedures for removing asbestos in public and 
private elementary and secondary schools

a republican from scottsdale 
it doesnt feel good said house speaker joe lane 
friday was the 166th day of the session but taxes budgets and 
about 50 other pieces of legislation are still not settled and the 
lawmakers are operating on reduced pay increased fatigue and in 
some cases worse health 
in theory legislative sessions are supposed to end by the 
saturday of the week in which the 100th day falls 
but the house impeachment and senate trial of gov evan mecham 
took weeks out of each chambers schedule this year and the trauma 
started last year when mecham faced off against a largely 
inexperienced set of legislative leaders 
the stage was set in 1986 when thengov bruce babbitt decided 
to run for president house majority leader burton barr decided to 
run for governor speaker james sossaman ran for senate and senate 
president stan turley and minority leader alfredo gutierrez retired 
mecham beat barr in a rough republican primary election and 
clashed repeatedly with the republicancontrolled legislature 
until this year when the senate ousted him on april 4 
now mecham loyalists are vowing revenge at the polls and 
democrats are drooling at the prospect of increased numbers in both 
chambers 
many republican incumbents simply arent running for 
reelection and others such as lane face uphill election fights 
if they find the time to gather signatures on their nominating 
petitions before the june 30 deadline 
among the casualties 
hal runyan the senates majority whip suffered a stroke 
while undergoing an operation and is confined to a wheelchair he 
comes in only for key votes and will not seek reelection 
greg lunn touted as one of the gops rising young stars 
aggravated a preulcerous condition and has decided to run for 
county supervisor instead of reelection 
jim ratliff the house majority leader suffered a heart 
attack and is retiring 
sterling ridge a glendale republican also is retiring 
citing health reasons 
hamilton in his 16th year as a representative said it was a 
very stressful session it is the cumulative effect of the mecham 
administration and the kind of meanness that was there all of 
this madness 
hamilton and senate democratic leader alan stephens say 
republican leaders bear some of the blame for allowing the session 
to continue drifting along 
weve been putting things off and putting things off and 
putting things off said stephens who estimated that 75 bills 
were languishing without debate while lawmakers cool their heels 
to paraphrase winston churchill never have so many worked 
for so long for so little hamilton said thursday after senate 
finance committee chairman jeff hill staged his second walkout of 
the week spiking a tentative tax agreement 
other than mechams impeachment lawmakers faced three major 
issues this year air quality indigent health care and a state 
budget of about 3 billion 
an airquality bill is on the governors desk but theres no 
agreement on indigent health or budgets 
lawmakers draw salaries of 15000 a year and extended their 
regular expense pay for 30 days beyond the normal 120day limit 
but since then they have been operating on reduced pay of 10 a day 
for phoenixarea lawmakers and 20 a day for those from outside 
maricopa county 
some grouchiness is a standard feature at every endofsession 
crunch as lawmakers confront issues they avoided at first but 
between the mecham trials unheeled scars and the prospect of 
election fights ahead lawmakers lobbyists and others say things 
seem worse than usual 
it just isnt as much fun said lunn 
the previous record 165 days was set in 1976

authorities in the soviet republic of kazakhstan 
have bowed to public pressure and decided to halt two controversial 
irrigation projects that would have damaged a vast inland lake 
tass reported 
the official news agency said friday that the projects were 
halted because studies showed they would cause the water level of 
lake balkhash to drop sharply the lake located in central asia 
covers 320 square miles 
tass said the decision was preceded by a campaign of letters and 
articles in kazakhstans staterun media against the scheme 
the lake in eastern kazakhstan helps modify the dry scorching 
climate of the area home to about 25 million people tass said 
since mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 soviet 
authorities have stopped a number of controversial largescale 
projects that scientists say would have done irreversible damage to 
the environment

us drug agents and paraguayan police 
captured three alleged drug smugglers and seized 590 pounds of 
cocaine shortly before the drugs were supposed to go to europe a 
newspaper reported 
in an attempt to break what us drug enforcement administration 
agents called the asuncion connection police arrested a 
bolivian and two colombians last saturday the trio allegedly were 
couriers for the notorious medellin drug cartel of colombia the 
daily independent hoy reported friday 
hoy said 222 packages of 97 percent pure cocaine worth about 
100 million were found jammed in nine suitcases at asuncions 
airport hours before a regularly scheduled commercial flight to 
madrid spain 
it was the largest drug bust in paraguay since 1982 when 92 
pounds of cocaine were found at a ranch 217 miles northeast of 
asuncion 
us drug enforcement administration agents have been working 
with paraguayan police since december when they reopened an office 
in the capital to counter the growing drug trade in this landlocked 
south american nation 
investigators say private aircraft registered in bordering 
bolivia were used to drop the cocaine at a ranch in the remote 
chaco region of western paraguay from there the cocaine was flown 
to asuncion in other small planes the newspaper said 
us officials say the medillin cartel sends to the united 
states about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in america

they could have been cremation pits 
cockfighting rings animal pens civil war foxholes or secret 
hiding places for moonshine equipment 
maybe they were prehistoric indian burial sites charcoal pits 
or foundations for native american abodes or maybe some say the 
stone circles dotting the western slope of polish mountain 
encircled apple trees in the early 1900s 
for more than a decade 150 to 200 circles of sandstone rock 
have puzzled area residents and archaelogists virtually hidden by 
brush and poison ivy the graycolored rocks of various shapes and 
sizes are neatly arranged in circles 
no one knows their purpose or who put them there 
everybody that goes up there has some kind of weird theory 
said john mash manager of green ridge state forest where the 
circles are found one guy even mentioned that they could have 
been sweat lodges like a turkish bath 
the indians would have these rituals when they would go into 
manhood he said they would go in these buildings with hot 
rocks and put water on them something like a sauna 
but 150 to 200 saunas on one hillside in western maryland 
mash said rangers noticed the stone rings in the early 1970s in 
1975 mash contacted state archaeologist tyler j bastian who 
visited the site and put the circles on a list of archaeological 
areas in maryland 
but it was not until last year that some archaelogists and 
volunteers excavated one of the circles they did the dig and 
found zip except for the rattlesnakes mash said 
hoping to uncover clues another group conducted a dig this 
spring 
in a nutshell we didnt discover anything they still remain 
a mystery said charles mcveigh jr a member of the western 
maryland archaeological society we dug out in the center of 
them we didnt go down very far before we got to bedrock we found 
no artifacts we found nothing to indicate prehistoric use 
no future digs are planned and two local archaeologists who 
took an interest in the circles robert d wall and connie 
huddleston both have moved from maryland neither could be reached 
for comment recently 
meanwhile the state forest has put the circles on its historic 
preservation list to ensure the fiveacre tract remains untouched 
mash said the site could be eligible for the national register of 
historic places if additional information could be found to 
document the age of the rings their use and significance 
mash has dismissed the moonshine theory because there is no 
nearby water source needed to make moonshine he said he did not 
think they were cockfighting rings because only one pit is needed 
to hold a fight and the rings are too close together to have been 
foxholes during the civil war he said 
the site has no strategic value mash said and the guy 
in the middle foxhole is going to be shooting his own pals before 
he can get his bullet out to hit the bad guys 
until someone conjures up a more believable theory mash said he 
puts the most stock in the orchard theory that someone placed the 
stones around apple trees that once grew in the area there were 1 
million apple trees in green ridge by 1914 he said 
it is possible that they hired immigrants who could not 
understand directions given in english and some of them were told 
to clear the rocks away to plant the apple trees he suggested 
they were new in america and wanted to do a nice neat job so 
they put these rocks in nice neat little circles and left a space 
in the middle for the tree and they might have worked on these for 
a couple of days or a week until somebody stopped them that could 
be a theory

high atop the chicago board of trade building a 
statue of ceres the roman goddess of grain stared unflinchingly 
into the searing cloudless sky if anybody was praying to her for 
rain she hadnt heard them 
besides the whispered plea of an iowa corn farmer wouldnt 
stand a chance against the din from the floor of the worlds oldest 
and largest grain exchange where bushels of grain are traded in 
millions and blessings are counted in dollars 
the board of trades grain floor abandoned by many traders when 
prices and trading activity slumped in the mid1980s is filled 
these days with people looking to profit from the midwestern 
drought 
as the drought withers crops across the farm belt it ignites 
big rallies on commodity exchanges where contracts for future 
delivery of grain grow more precious by the day 
this is the only place i could think of where i can make a lot 
of money in a fairly short period of time said brad whitacre 
21 an entrylevel employee of a large investment firm who dreams 
of owning his own seat on the exchange 
whitacres job is to stand just outside the apparent chaos of 
the jampacked corn futures pit and report to his boss on the moves 
of the markets major players he has put his college education on 
hold for this opportunity which was created by the dramatic rise 
in trading activity accompanying the droughtdriven jump in prices 
if you start out working at a corporation it takes years to 
work your way up to the top whitacre said but you come down 
here after a couple of years you buy a seat and you can be making 
a lot of money 
how much your imaginations the only limit 
whitacre isnt the only one lured to the board of trade by one 
of the biggest grain rallies in the exchanges 140year history 
the population of the grain trading floor has swelled more than 40 
percent to nearly 2000 in just the past two months according to 
exchange figures 
about half of those people are traders their job is to face 
each other on the steps of circular pits and use a combination of 
hand signals and shouted bids to strike deals for deliveries of 
grain and soybeans in 5000bushel lots 
big trading companies such as refco inc and campd commodities 
frequently trade thousands of contracts totaling millions of 
bushels during a session 
perhaps a third of the traders are independents called 
locals or scalpers who trade for their own accounts and 
drift from pit to pit in search of action when grain trading 
slowed after the volatile dryweather period of late 1983 and 
early 1984 many locals moved to the exchanges financialfutures 
room to bet on the performance of stocks and bonds 
because of its boisterous nature trading in the pits is usually 
perceived as a young persons game but among the recent returnees 
to the grain room are a good number of silverhaired veterans some 
of whom say their experience gives them an edge 
i can tell whats going on standing here with a blindfold 
on said 74yearold paul mcguire a former board of trade 
chairman as he surveyed the scene from the sidelines while waiting 
for the right moment to strike 
i can tell whether the markets are going up or down by the 
sound 
although this is the fifth significant dryweather boom the 
grain markets have seen since the recordsetting rally of 1973 the 
timing and severity of this drought makes it unique traders said 
nobody here has ever really traded on the fear of a real 
potential disaster said one trader who asked not to be 
identified thats what makes this market different from any 
other time in history 
independent traders resent the perception that they seek to 
profit from the nations misfortune a view that inspired a recent 
chicago tribune editorial cartoon depicting commodity traders as 
vultures descending on a droughtstricken farmer 
when the traders start to make a little money some people 
begrudge it to us but they dont realize weve had a severely 
depressed business here the last four years said bernard dorman 
an independent grain trader who also runs a small trading company 
we feel very badly that the farmers are hurt but we cant do 
anything about that dorman said we just follow the market we 
dont make the market

ambulance operators say ford motor co may 
have done an inadequate job of repairing up to 14500 fireprone 
ambulances and they are calling for an investigation by federal 
transportation officials 
ford counters that its recall work on the ambulances has been 
more than adequate and that some ambulance operators have been slow 
to bring in the vehicles for repairs 
the american ambulance association a washingtonbased 
organization representing private ambulance operators said friday 
in a letter to the national highway traffic safety administration 
that it had received reports of long delays unavailable parts 
shoddy work and added bills for fixing the ambulances 
it would appear that a significant number of ambulances are 
still not fully retrofitted the association wrote 
ford recalled about 14500 of the vehicles converted to 
ambulances by other companies from the 19831987 ford econoline 
e350 models after reports of fuelsystem problems that caused 
fires 
the recall came in two phases one in july 1987 for rerouting of 
the fuel line and a second in august 1987 for installation of 
further safety precautions 
more than 20 fires were reported and were blamed on 
overpressurization of fuel tanks and lines caused by muffler heat 
we feel the recall is certainly more than adequate said 
mike parris a ford spokesman in dearborn mich were concerned 
with it we dont take it lightly at all we dont drag our feet 
weve made every effort to try to get these people in here to 
get this recall taken care of 
he said some 700 ford dealers had parts available for the recall 
work if these people will bring these vehicles in they can have 
it done parris said 
eighty percent of the recalled ambulances were brought in for 
the first phase of work but only 65 percent have undergone the 
second phase parris said 
nhtsa has 120 days to respond to the ambulance associations 
petition

representatives from eight 
california churches say el salvadors army stopped them from 
delivering food medicine and fertilizer to resettled refugees in 
northern el salvador 
eight representatives of bay area churches and synagogues told a 
news conference friday that the 4th army brigade blocked their 
threetruck convoy on june 16 
the convoy which was carrying about 7000 worth of supplies 
was stopped in chalatenango the capital of the northern province 
of the same name 
the supplies which were bound for the towns of guarjila and los 
ranchos were left in a convent in the town while efforts to 
deliver them continued the church workers said 
leftist guerrillas battling the usbacked government of 
president jose napoleon duarte maintain a strong military and 
political presence in much of chalatenango province 
dean mcfalls a member of the church group and a student at the 
pacific school of religion in berkeley calif said the delegation 
had obtained permission to deliver the supplies from military 
officials in san salvador before leaving for the region 
los ranchos and guarjila were evacuated in the early 1980s 
because of heavy fighting in the civil war the towns were 
resettled last fall under the auspices of the nongovernmental 
national committee for repopulation they now have a combined 
population of about 1800 
over the past year the armed forces have allowed some relief 
shipments to reach their destinations but have held up others 
military authorities have expressed concern the supplies might end 
up in rebel hands 
people who answered the phone at 4th brigade headquarters and 
the armys public relations office said no one was immediately 
available for comment on the blocked convoy

congress and the reagan administration that compromise was crafted 
to control government outlays the amount of money actually paid 
out during the fiscal year

to ban germs and dangerous toxins from the mail just as the 
military reportedly was planning to increase shipments of such 
materials 
the regulations were announced friday but must go through a 
formal rulemaking process before they take effect 
the postal service said it took the action because of concern 
that some customers are planning increased use of the mails for 
sending disease germs or hazardous toxins etiologic agents 
jeremy rifkin an activist who heads the foundation on economic 
trends in washington hailed the decision as a step toward avoiding 
a potential catastrophe he had petitioned the postal service to 
ban such shipments 
rifkin said he plans to push the transportation department to 
investigate shipments of dangerous products by private carriers 
various products including biological warfare toxins have been 
mailed in the past under strict packaging and labeling rules and 
postal officials say no problems have occurred 
but following reports that the army planed to expand research 
facilities in utah california attorney general john van de kamp 
complained that the need for increased shipments of dangerous 
biological products could create a hazard 
army officials have told a house subcommittee that they actually 
ship very few parcels containing biological items and those almost 
always by private commercial carrier 
the packages have been tested and are literally able to survive 
an aircraft or highway crash said thomas r dashiell director of 
environmental and life sciences at the defense department 
while attention has focused on shipments of germs and toxins by 
the military the federal centers for disease control and other 
medical establishments also make such shipments officials report 
our experience to date seems to support the opinion expressed 
by medical experts that there is little risk associated with 
handling properly packaged etiologic agents postmaster general 
anthony frank said in a letter to rifkin 
the planned new rules would cover dangerous items but would not 
affect the mailing of blood samples and other such materials being 
sent to laboratories for routine medical testing the postal 
service said 
postal regulations already prohibit the mailing of a variety of 
items including strikeanywhere matches explosives fuses many 
poisons most flammable liquids and certain chemicals

the senate is headed for a showdown vote next 
week on a proposal that would require companies to give their 
workers advance notice of major layoffs or plant closings 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said a gop amendment 
would be proposed monday to either eliminate the 60day notice 
requirement for layoffs or shorten it 
democrats in the senate on friday overwhelmingly defeated a pair 
of republican amendments to the legislation 
defeated on respective votes of 6027 and 5931 were amendments 
to make picket line violence during a labor dispute a federal crime 
and to exempt from the notice requirements employers who give 
laidoff workers 60 days of severance pay 
after stalling action on the legislation for three days 
republican leaders agreed friday to allow a vote late monday on 
their main attempt to derail the notice requirements 
the notice provision has come before the senate after being 
separated from a trade bill that president reagan vetoed last month 
because it contained that requirement 
dole said a gop amendment would be offered on monday by sen 
nancy kassebaum rkan mrs kassebaum has said she supports 60 
days notice in cases of plant closings but not when an employer is 
just laying off 50 or more workers as the democraticsponsored 
bill requires 
democratic leaders have threatened to kill to any chance of 
winning enactment of either the advance notice requirement or the 
trade bill if mrs kassebaums amendment is approved 
this is a killer amendment said majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva not only does it kill this bill but it will kill 
the trade bill ive maintained all along that the president 
doesnt want a trade bill 
democrats still hope to send the plant closing measure to the 
white house by july 4 for an expected veto by reagan 
byrd said friday he anticipates final passage of the plant 
closings bill by the senate on tuesday house speaker jim wright 
dtexas has vowed to seek its passage in the house immediately 
after the senates approval

a government study of us sanctions against 
south africa says that nation in the past two years has suffered a 
624 million reduction in exports of sanctioned goods to the united 
states and other trading partners 
the general accounting office report presented friday to the 
senate foreign relations committee said exports to the united 
states had been cut by about 417 million and that the remainder of 
the reduction was in south africas exports of sanctioned goods to 
19 other countries 
only in the agricultural products market was south africa able 
to offset losses from us sanctions and to actually increase its 
total exports said allan i mendelowitz an associate director 
of the gaos international division 
mendelowitz said that since the enactment of the sanctions over 
president reagans veto in 1986 south africa experienced sharp 
losses in exports of coal iron and steel uranium and textiles 
i think the bottom line in shorthand is that sanctions are 
working in terms of economic impact said sen paul simon 
dill a member of the senate panel what we cannot know is 
whether this will result in a policy change by south africa 
the testimony came as the committee concluded three days of 
public hearings on legislation to tighten sanctions against south 
africa by requiring a neartotal trade embargo and by requiring all 
us companies to withdraw from the country 
mendelowitz said that since 1984 162 us companies have 
withdrawn from south africa and that nine of the 150 companies 
remaining have announced their intention to leave 
opponents of the new sanctions have raised the possibility south 
africa might retaliate by cutting off exports to the united states 
of a list of strategic minerals of vital importance to us 
industry 
mendelowitz noted the us bureau of mines recently reported 
there are sufficient alternative sources of supply for manganese 
chromium palladium titanium and vanadium but not for platinum and 
rhodium 
the mines bureau also said that cobalt supplies would remain 
available from zaire if new routes for shipping it were developed 
to bypass south african railways and ports 
other witnesses representing us companies remaining in south 
africa opposed the legislation contending it would cost the jobs 
of thousands of black south africans and shut down the programs 
they have instituted changes 
improve the lot of their black employees

a major magnetic storm is expected to envelop 
the earth on monday as particles spewed by giant explosions on the 
sun disrupt global communications alter satellite orbits and 
impair electric power systems 
the warning issued friday by the federal space environment 
laboratory in boulder colo was spurred by a series of solar 
flares huge sunspotrelated explosions that hurl xray 
electrically charged particles and hot gases toward earth 
one of the blasts was the largest flare since april 1984 said 
dale gary a solar astronomer at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena 
the laboratory issued a major magnetic storm warning for monday 
and a minor magnetic storm warning for tuesday forecaster chris 
balch said by telephone from the lab 
the flares pose no direct threat to earth life but the magnetic 
storm could interfere with longdistance phone calls electric 
power transmission radio broadcasts pipeline control systems and 
communications with airplanes and ships said gary heckman space 
environment services chief at the lab 
the storm was also expected to push earths auroras away from 
the poles making the northern lights visible as far south as the 
great lakes boston and england heckman said 
proton radiation associated with the solar flare was expected to 
approach earth today he said heckman added that it should be mild 
and pose no radidation hazard to two soviet cosmonauts orbiting 
earth especially if they stay inside their mir space station 
the magnetic storm also will cause errors in the orbits of 
some satellites because of increased drag as well as particles 
hitting electronic parts heckman said it will slow them down in 
orbit some people will have trouble operating their satellites 
it also could induce stray voltages in power transmission 
systems causing temporary outages and making lights flicker he 
said 
the last significant magnetic storm occurred in august 1972 and 
disrupted communications worldwide for two days although the one 
expected monday shouldnt be that large heckman said 
the warning was sent to the national aeronautics and space 
administration the defense department the federal aviation 
administration and other agencies whose satellites or 
communications could be disrupted the space environment laboratory 
is part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
xrays from the biggest flare probably disrupted communications 
briefly friday although there were no immediate reports heckman 
said 
fridays big flare started at 944 am pdt and lasted nearly 
two hours blach said another somewhat smaller one began at 901 
am and lasted 41 minutes a much smaller flare lasting 47 minutes 
exploded at 220 pm forecaster norman cohen said 
two other flares were observed thursday gary said 
were expecting high levels of sunspot and flare activity 
for the next three days cohen said from boulder 
the sunspots and flares occurred on the west edge of the sun 
and their influence on earth will diminish as they migrate toward a 
part of the sun not facing the planet he added 
magnetic storms occur about six times every 11year sunspot 
cycle while flares erupt three or four times annually during the 
active phase of the sunspot cycle cohen said 
solar flares occur when the magnetic configuration of sunspots 
gets complicated and twisted then they release stored energy 
gary said 
magnetic storms disrupt communications by altering the shape of 
earths ionosphere a layer of electrically charged particles 100 
to 500 miles above the planets surface heckman said 
the visible portion of fridays big flare was observed from 
caltechs solar observatory near big bear calif gary said it 
extended perhaps 200000 miles above the suns surface and came 
from a group of about 20 sunspots some up to three times larger 
than earth he said

officials closed a major gasoline 
supply depot as two more victims of the explosions and fire there 
died lifting the official number of dead to four 
one company however said 13 of its workers were missing and a 
newspaper accused authorities of hiding deaths 
a press release from pemex the government oil monopoly also 
said 18 people were injured four of them seriously 
the disaster began thursday afternoon when three huge tanks 
filled with gasoline exploded one after another the blasts and 
resulting fire with temperatures up to 5400 degrees fahrenheit 
forced about 10000 residents of this northern industrial city to 
flee 
many evacuees headed home friday though officials said a small 
fire still burned at one tank 
it was the second explosion and fire in a month at a depot 
operated by pemex on may 24 more than 100000 people were forced 
from the area around a gas and kerosene supply depot in the 
northern city of chihuahua no one was hurt but pemex shut down 
that tank farm permanently 
the monterrey company constructora quiroga y villarreal which 
maintains pemex fireprevention equipment gave the monterrey 
newspaper el norte the names of 54 of its workers who it said were 
at the plant when the tanks exploded it said 13 of those people 
had yet to be found 
maria estella garcia a company secretary said that some of the 
missing possibly died because weve been told that there are 
people that they havent been able to identify because they are so 
badly burned 
she said she did not know if that information came from pemex or 
state health officials 
one of the dead vicente quiroga garcia was ownermanager of 
the company she said she added that his son company manager 
vicente quiroga villarreal was hospitalized with severe burns 
theyre hiding deaths read a banner headline in the daily 
newspaper el sol the story said an el sol reporter sneaked into 
the monterrey green cross morgue wearing a green cross jacket and 
saw seven badly burned bodies 
efforts to reach pemex spokesmen in both office visits and by 
telephone were unsuccessful secretaries said they did not know 
when officials could be reached 
many residents were ignoring police barricades and returning 
home early friday when it appeared the last flames had been 
extinguished however they fled in panic again when a fire 
reignited in one tank 
reporters outside the depot gates watched about 20 firefighters 
man equipment 10 yards from the burning tank as thick swirls of 
fire and smoke poured out 
a few minutes later the tank collapsed but the flames 
continued licking another charred tank next to it firefighters had 
already managed to empty the second tank 
about 150 feet away modest homes and businesses line the avenue 
in this city on the eastern outskirts of the nuevo leon state 
capital of monterrey which has a metropolitan population of about 
28 million 
raul robles assistant commercial director of pemex blamed the 
explosions and fire on a leak in one of the tanks the tanks that 
blew up each contained 22 million gallons of gasoline 
the tank farm was closed friday by both company and government 
officials 
raul de la garza the nuevo leon state press secretary said the 
depot will remain closed at least until safety experts look it over 
and complete an investigation 
the depot one of two petroleum supply facilities in the area 
contains 23 tanks that provide regular and unleaded gasoline and 
diesel fuel to gasoline stations and other users in the state 
however closure of the guadalupe plant was not expected to have a 
major impact because gasoline can be supplied from a huge refinery 
at cadereyta about 30 miles away 
garza said residents were being allowed to return to their homes 
late friday although minuscule amounts of gasoline was still 
burning in one storage tank 
thick clouds of black smoke poured across the monterrey 
metropolitan area friday evening 
many of the nearly 500 evacuees who packed one emergency shelter 
said friday night they were fearful of going back 
im too frightened to return now said sofia villegas a 
41yearold mother we were so happy to be going home this 
morning and then it happened all over again 
im staying the night here she added 
meanwhile guadalupe mayor adan lopez said in an interview at 
one shelter that he would ask the state government to relocate the 
huge tank farm 
asked if he considered the depot a risk to the public safety 
lopez said it never stops being one

substance called carboncarbon or carbon composite to europe and 
egypt 
rocket specialist abdelkader helmy described by us attorney 
david levi as the director of the american end of the alleged 
international export ring was jailed friday in sacramento county 
jail a detention hearing was scheduled monday in federal court 
the special carbon material developed in the united states is 
used extensively in highspeed aircraft missiles and rockets 
because it has a low visibility level to radar and is heat 
resistant 
the carbon is on the federal restricted list and requires 
special licenses to be exported 
two of those named in the complaint filed by the us attorneys 
office were in custody friday and a third was at large but

this is conspiracy with deep roots in the sacramento area 
levi said in announcing the governments 35page complaint 
helmy an egyptian with american citizenship received 1 
million in payments from apparent egyptian sources through a 
swissbased bank for his role in the scheme us authorities said 
carboncarbon is an american technology that shouldnt be 
given to foreign nations said dan brown a spokesman for aerojet 
solid propulsion co which employed helmy 
the egyptians apparently intended to use the material in a 
program with argentina to develop a surfacetosurface missile 
reagan administration officials told the new york times 
levi said aerojet cooperated with federal agents who conducted 
the investigation the probe is still under way levi added 
hundreds of pounds of the carbon composite were believed to have 
been shipped to a washington dc building owned by the egyptian 
government as an apparent stopover for eventual transfer to egypt 
investigators said 
about 430 pounds of the material was seized at the 
baltimorewashington international airport friday as the defendants 
allegedly attempted to take it out of the country on an egyptian 
c130 military air transport

custody but levi said officials sought to interview him in austria 
the complaint alleged that helmy using his technical knowledge 
directed huffman to buy various chemicals and supplies and ship 
them to baltimore where mohammed made plans to ship them without 
complying with us export controls 
brown said helmy apparently used his position in our plant 
to receive sensitive materials a woman answering the phone at his 
home about 110 miles northeast of san francisco refused to talk to 
a reporter i have no comment on this at all she said 
mohammed wahby press attache at the egyptian embassy said

only advisory in april gov rafael hernandez colon said he and at 
least 53 others in the puerto rico delegation would support dukakis

ricans he said should choose their own form of government with 
no interference and without intimidation

united states before a puerto rican vote on political status the 
governing party supports commonwealth status established in 1952 
but wants greater local power 
some believe ending legal ties to the united states before 
voting on status would virtually rule out statehood republican

for support in freeing haiti from the military dictatorship 
give us your support against the military coup manigat

amid shouts of fire and the thunder 
of cannon thousands of men in blue and gray stormed each other to 
reenact the opening of the battle of gettysburg 125 years after 
the civil wars bloodiest confrontation 
a total of about 8000 men representing union and confederate 
troops traded mock rifle volleys and cannon bursts friday ripping 
open paper gunpowder cartridges with their teeth while enemy lines 
closed in 
the confederate troops pushed back the unions blackhatted 
iron brigade as scores of men on both sides feigned death in 
the tall grass and spectators watched from a hill overlooking the 
field 
when it gets to firing youre not in 1988 anymore youre in 
1863 said jeff douthit a 28yearold farmer from unionville va 
the participants among them teachers engineers artists and 
soldiers had invested 1000 to outfit themselves with the 
uniform gear and guns needed to become civil war soldiers if only 
for a day or two 
soldiers in the 23rd new york regiment played by a group from 
arizona went so far as to follow union recipes down to hard 
tack hard flat squares of bread 
you might think it was made 125 years ago its that 
indigestable said ed gouvier a 37yearold engineer from 
phoenix 
mentioning anything modern by members of the 23rd new york 
resulted in punishment standing on a wooden crate at the end of 
one of the rows of white canvas tents 
gouvier said people joined the outfit for a chance to relive 
history for the camaraderie or to take part in the battles 
ive always been a history fanatic he said 
others had more personal reasons for joining one of the ersatz 
armies 
steve dicarlo of owings md said he became a member of the 
18th virginia regiment in part because his 
greatgreatgreatgrandfather was a captain in the confederate army 
my wife thinks im crazy he said 
napoleonic tactics inc which sold tickets to cover its 
450000 budget for staging three days of ersatz warfare has 
billed the event as the largest civil war reenactment ever the 
consulting company was hired by the events sponor the american 
civil war commemorative committee inc 
a total of 75000 spectators were expected to attend the 
reenactment on farmland five miles south of the actual 
battlefield the event ends sunday with the restaging of picketts 
charge 
the battle of gettysburg took place from july 13 1863 and 
resulted in a total of close to 50000 dead and wounded 
confederate gen robert e lee was moving from the north toward 
gettysburg to get shoes for his troops and secure the roads running 
through the southern pennsylvania town said kim bernard holien a 
historian for the us army center of military history 
the unions army of the potomac was moving north when the chance 
encounter at mcphersons ridge touched off the bloody battle he 
said 
many of the current soldiers said they prepared for the 
battle for months because its size set it apart 
tactical commanders for both sides met thursday night to map out 
the next days skirmish 
supposedly everythings supposed to happen according to the 
script said paul baebler a spokesman for napoleonic tactics 
the people who won the first time will win again he said 
organizers had said the number of troops falling dead in 
fridays skirmish would be proportionate to actual losses 
but michael kraus commander of the union forces said troops 
often improvise on the field 
its an individual thing said kraus a 34yearold artist 
from creston ohio 
the largest previous civil war reenactment was the battle of 
first manassas in july 1986 involving 6000 reenactors according 
to napoleonic tactics

delvalle who had tried to fire noriega commander of panamas 
15000member defense forces 
noriega has been indicted by two us federal grand juries on 
drug trafficking charges he has successfully resisted us 
economic sanctions aimed at forcing him to step down president

illegal 
the japanese official declined to elaborate on thursdays

feet across on the roof in which rain and melted snow collected and

about 150000 estonians gathered in meadow outside 
the capital of estonia and demanded that soviet officials grant 
greater autonomy to its republics a newspaper said 
the group also denounced soviet dictator josef stalin who 
seized estonia according to the report in tuesdays edition of 
soviet estonia newspaper seen in moscow on friday 
the call for a soviet federation of republics with the right to 
manage their own affairs came at a rally organized by the national 
front a group of communist party members and other people founded 
in april with official backing 
the paper quoted leaders of the rally in the baltic republic as 
saying estonias 32 delegates to next weeks party conference in 
moscow should seek approval to turn the region into a sovereign 
republic 
five of the delegates spoke at the meeting they said they 
wanted estonia to be given the right to fix its own prices pay and 
investments and to formulate its own cultural ecological and 
other policies 
tiit vyakhi a delegate from an estonian auto repair shop told 
the crowd i think its very important for estonia and all 
republics to get their sovereignty recognized its necessary to 
confirm the principle of a united federation composed of sovereign 
states with fully equal rights 
hundreds of intellectuals in latvia have made similar demands 
for a form of home rule for the soviet unions 15 republics the 
baltic republics incorporated into the soviet union under a secret 
protocol of the 1939 sovietnazi pact have long been the countrys 
most economically developed and westwardlooking regions 
other delegates and speakers at the unprecedented meeting in a 
meadow outside the estonian capital of tallinn demanded immediate 
condemnation of stalinism and by implication of the soviet 
seizure of the baltic republics in 1940 
the official news agency tass reported friday that estonia has 
set up a commission chaired by republican president arnold ruutel 
to do justice to thousands of victims of stalinist deportations 
in 1941 and 1949 
dear delegates a lathe operator from tartu told the rally 
you dont have any time to wait for the final titanic works of 
doctors of science about our history 
within a few days you must make clear who it was in 1940 who 
hacked up our science books and childrens books with axes and make 
clear that we are a people of many centuries of culture 
the report said speeches at the rally were greeted not just 
with applause but with the thunder of ovations pictures 
published with the accounts showed crowds waving banners calling 
for an end to privilege and praising the new estonian communist 
party leader vaino vyalyas named to his post june 16 
although speakers emphasized nationalist demands they stressed 
they did not want to secede from the soviet union and none was 
quoted as challenging the rule of the communist party 
dissatisfaction has been rising in estonia over the migration of 
ethnic russians into the republic where ethnic estonians are now a 
minority and over what is seen as the diminishing role of estonian 
language and traditions 
conference delegate mare rossmann a teacher was quoted as 
saying estonians simply want to live freely and happily on our 
land 
we want to decide ourselves what happiness is we think this 
is the right of all peoples she said 
the newspaper did not explain why it took four days to publish 
an account of the meeting which it said was held june 17 a day 
before estonias staterun media published the republics platform 
for next weeks national party conference in moscow 
the account of the rally suggested the militant mood in estonia 
has at least the tacit backing of the republics communist party 
and that citizens expect immediate results from the moscow 
conference opening on tuesday

chairman maos grandson might be tall and hefty 
but thats the only thing that makes him stand out in a crowd a 
newspaper reported today 
china youth news said the 18yearold grandson of late leader 
mao tsetung could be considered a huge monster when compared 
with the average high school student 
mao xinyu who stands 5foot 10inches tall and weighs nearly 
220 pounds is the son of mao anqing mao tsetungs only known 
living son 
a report last december said the 62yearold mao anqing his 
wife zhang shaohua and their only son were living quietly in a 
beijing villa 
mao tsetung married four times and had nine children including 
a daughter by his last wife jiang qing he died in 1976 jiang 
qing is believed alive 
detailed reports of the lives of chinas leaders and their 
families are rare 
the paper described the high school senior as an amiable and 
cheerful youth who gets along well with his classmates and is 
treated just like any other student 
he is fond of history perhaps because of the historical legacy 
of his forefathers and his best grades are in history class the 
report said 
besides his schoolbooks and some historical writings xinyu also 
likes to read classical novels historical drama and classical 
poetry it said 
as he prepares for the nationwide college entrance exams that 
will be administered next month xinyu is still trying to decide 
what to study he likes history but thinks law or philosophy might 
be more practical the newspaper said 
philosophy is considered practical in china because graduates in 
the field are often assigned jobs in poweful propaganda bureaus 
xinyu was born jan 17 1970 in the midst of the ultraleftist 
cultural revolution and rarely saw his father for the first six 
years of his life the report said 
however this has not prevented xinyu from respecting his 
father the report said mao anqing is believed to suffer from 
mental illness but the paper made no mention of his health 
xinyus classmates often discuss their impressions of chairman 
mao and his mistakes and xinyu willingly joins in these 
discussion it said 
actually except that he is maos grandson xinyus appraisal 
of this great historical figure is no different from that of his 
classmates the report said 
since the end of the cultural revolution in 1976 mao has been 
criticized for creating a cult of personality and for leftist 
excesses that drove chinas economy into the ground

speakers at next weeks national communist party 
conference will plea for greater economic competition in the 
staterun economy an adviser to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
said 
leonid abalkin head of the economics institute in the soviet 
academy of sciences called friday for an atmosphere of 
competition winning over the consumer and open competition by 
individual enterprises for state orders 
reformers have heavily criticized the centrally controlled 
system of economic planning 
however abalkin said the countrys economic system will be 
radically changed beginning in the early 1990s and those changes 
will be discussed at the conference that begins tuesday 
abalkin said several speeches to the conference of 5000 
delegates will be devoted to encouraging economic competition his 
comments represented one of the few signs from officials of a 
specific topic to be considered and an indication of the issues 
importance in the eyes of economic reformers 
the economist is a delegate to the party conference and a key 
adviser to gorbachev 
several speeches to the party conference will criticize the 
system of government procurement now accomplished by a vast system 
of orders to individual staterun businesses he said 
reforms dont intend to do away with government procurement but 
change the ways they reach the enterprises not the old ways 
command and bureaucratic but the method based on competition 
between enterprises to win government orders abalkin said 
i am certain that more than one statement will be devoted to 
this question he said 
he added that satisfying pentup demand for consumer goods and 
services will be possible only if the monopolization by the 
producer is ruled out and economic competition between individual 
enterprises is asserted 
reformers trace many of the soviet unions economic problems to 
a bureaucratic system of management that stifles local initiative 
and ignores market demands 
asked about a radical estonian economic program for the party 
conference abalkin said central authorities must allow local

lebanese territorial waters are neither 
radioactive nor contaminated by tons of italian toxic waste that 
have been dumped in recent months in this chaotic country news 
reports said today 
beiruts daily assafir said the lebanese health ministry issued 
a report saying the waters were not contaminated after an expert 
committee examined samples of sea water friday 
a lebanese businessman imported 2400 tons of toxic chemical 
waste from italy two weeks ago and some of it was reported dumped 
on the kesrouan coastal strip 20 miles north of beirut 
in addition about 40 barrels inscribed cairo oil and 
containing suspiciouslooking pink and golden powder were 
discovered off the coast of tyre in south lebanon and tabarja in 
the north 
the two events combined with an outbreak of skin rashes among 
people who swam in the sea drove the usually stoic lebanese off 
their beaches 
the contents of the barrels the sea water and fish examined 
are not radioactive said the report 
the barrels contain organic brown powder that does not include 
any heavy poisonous metallic material it said 
the ministry qualifed the report in saying it was sending 
maritime biological and geological samples for further 
examination abroad to determine whether future risks are 
involved it did not elaborate or say where it was sending the 
samples 
the statement urged the lebanese not to swim in the sea and to 
avoid eating fish pending the outcome of the final report expected 
in two weeks

chinese officials are listening carefully to hong 
kong residents worries about laws that will govern them when the 
colony reverts to chinese rule in 1997 a british envoy said today 
meanwhile hong kongs government announced today that britain 
will increase its share of the colonys defense costs during the 
nine years before china takes over 
in a brief statement the government said britain will shoulder 
35 percent of defense costs up from 25 percent under the formula 
that expired march 31 
about 13000 british soldiers and dependents are stationed on 
the colony 
in beijing lord glenarthur britains state minister for asian 
affairs told a news conference that he discussed hong kong 
residents concerns with chinese officials 
many in hong kong fear the draft of its future basic law or 
constitution does not adequately protect civil liberties and could 
be changed by the chinese after 1997 to further reduce freedoms 
the draft was completed in april and the chinese legislature was 
expected to pass a final version by 1990 
it was quite clear to me that chinese vice foreign minister 
zhou nan paid careful attention to what i was saying and that the 
chinese government is taking equally careful note of the views 
expressed in hong kong the british envoy said 
britain has ruled the thriving port of hong kong on chinas 
southeast coast since 1842 
the british official also said chinese leaders expressed support 
for the recent decision by hong kongs colonial government to 
repatriate those vietnamese boat people not fleeing political 
persecution

students in this small southwestern missouri 
town who just wanna dance go to court monday to see if a federal 
judge will strike up the right tune 
i didnt think it would go this far said george fox 18 a 
spring graduate of purdy high school where about 160 students were 
enrolled we started this i just want to see it get finished 
at issue is one sentence that has been part of the purdy school 
boards policy book for as long as anyone can remember 
school dances are not authorized and school premises shall not 
be used for purposes of conducting a dance 
residents say generations of students in the town of about 900 
people have made an annual ritual of appealing to the school board 
to rescind the ban then quietly accepting a refusal that came as 
regularly as a final exam foxs class was different 
fox is among 21 purdy students and their parents who filed suit 
in 1986 asking the courts to strike down the ban as an 
unconstitutional encroachment of religious values on public life 
fox said fellow students have told him theyre against dancing 
because parents and ministers have told them it is a sin 
prodancers believe the ban unique among southern missouri 
school districts has endured because many in the community have a 
southern baptistinspired opposition to dancing 
thats not true said ransom ellis iii the attorney 
representing the school board the motivation was purely 
secular 
ellis said he would not expand on his argument because it would 
mean revealing evidence he planned to present in court 
us district judge russell clark has set aside four days 
beginning monday to hear the case in springfield clark was also 
considering a countersuit filed by the school district in which 
officials seek 1 million in damages claiming students and parents 
have harassed them over the dancing issue 
the suit filed by students and parents with backing from the 
american civil liberties union seeks a court order to keep the 
school from enforcing the dance ban attorneys fees and 1 in 
damages 
in 1986 purdy students signed a petition in support of a school 
dance and asked for their parents help when they took the request 
before the school board they were met with resistance organized in 
local churches so many people were drawn to the school board 
meeting at which the ban was challenged that it had to be moved to 
the high school gymnasium 
dance supporters were unable to get the school board to end the 
ban though they followed the petition drive with a rally that drew 
national attention the students invited stars of the musical 
footloose a movie about a fictional texas town where dancing 
was banned to the rally actors kevin bacon and lori singer were 
unable to attend 
in april 1986 school district voters reelected by wide margins 
the antidancing board members 
the controversy escalated to the point where dance supporters 
and opponents walked on opposite sides of the street 
a lot of people refer to me as a troublemaker an outsider 
said joan fox george foxs mother 
her family has lived in purdy for 13 years but remain newcomers 
in the eyes of lifelong residents mrs fox said it hasnt helped 
that she is a vocal supporter of what she says is her childrens 
right to dance at school 
they shouldnt be barred from homecoming and prom at school 
its a public school she said

a jurys decision that cigarettes should 
have carried a warning label before 1966 should encourage other 
lungcancer victims to sue manufacturers despite the fact that no 
damages were awarded an attorney said 
this is very similar to the history of asbestos litigation 
where at the beginning cases were lost and now liability is clearly 
established said ben shein an attorney for the estate of john 
ray gunsalus 
a federal jury said friday that cigarettes manufactured by 
american tobacco co were defective prior to 1966 because they did 
not have a warning label but it said the lack of a warning was not 
a substantial factor in gunsalus death of lung cancer last 
year at age 55 
gunsalus a pall mall smoker who first lit up at age 11 worked 
at the chester shipyards where asbestos was prevalent and the case 
brought by his estate sought to tie the hazards of smoking to those 
of working around asbestos 
dan conforti public information director for american brands 
the stamford connbased parent company of american tobacco said 
the company was pleased with the verdict 
the case was decided less than two weeks after a jury in newark 
nj decided a tobacco company should pay 400000 to the widower 
of a lifelong smoker it was the first monetary award from a 
cigarette maker after about 300 attempts in courtrooms from coast 
to coast 
shein said fridays ruling poses a serious threat to tobacco 
companies in the future attorneys were considering an appeal 
he added the estate had been seeking unspecified damages for pain 
and suffering 
we intend to continue this area of litigation and believe this 
should encourage other injured parties who have brought similar 
actions against tobacco companies he said 
according to testimony from dr paul epstein of graduate 
hospital in philadelphia gunsalus died of cancer caused by smoking 
and asbestos exposure 
epstein a witness for the gunsalus estate said the interaction 
of asbestos and cigarette smoke creates a far greater risk of 
cancer than either substance does on its own 
but american tobacco attorney edward f mannino argued that 
gunsalus health history not smokings dangers were the issue he 
pointed to gunsalus history of heavy drinking multiple stab 
wounds and three heart attacks 
in closing remarks thursday mannino said gunsalus smoked 
because he chose to and described him as a strongwilled person 
who ignored six doctors warnings to quit smoking 
thomas f johnson an attorney for gunsalus estate responded 
by telling the jury the unspoken assumption of american 
tobaccos argument is what does it matter if we kill a bum

angolan guerrilla leader jonas savimbis fervor for 
stopping communism in his homeland was hailed by cuban exiles here 
yet his acceptance of arms from south africa has raised questions 
savimbi head of angolas unita rebels spoke here friday as 
part of a us tour to drum up support and discuss peace talks 
aimed at ending the 13year civil war with angolas marxist 
cubanbacked government 
but the burly personable savimbi has found himself on a public 
relations tightrope he is cheered for his struggle for democratic 
freedom yet denounced for accepting arms from a government that 
openly practices racial discrimination 
im not here to discuss the policies of south africa which i 
condemn im fighting for freedom and you must do it any way you 
can savimbi told a news conference when you are fighting for 
your country you must get help from even the devil himself 
savimbi who has been criticized by democratic presidential 
contender michael dukakis and influential blacks said that even 
american patriots enlisted the aid of european monarchies in the 
revolution against the british monarchy 
in a fight for freedom sometimes you have to look out for 
your interests first he said 
savimbi said a cuban troop buildup in angola clouds the peace 
talks that began this week in cairo egypt the third round of 
discussions in two months 
the united states which also helps arm the angolan guerrillas 
is mediating between south africa and a joint angolancuban 
delegation to resolve angolas civil war and end south african rule 
over neighboring namibia 
the talks have so far hinged on south africas demand that cuba 
withdraw its troops from angola as a precondition for namibias 
independence 
there were 45000 cuban troops in march and now there are 
57000 savimbi said theyre not withdrawing theyre 
increasing tremendously 
savimbis oneday visit to miami was sponsored by the 
cubanamerican national foundation a staunchly anticommunist 
group with offices here and in washington 
foundation head jorge mas canosa said a private dinner honored 
savimbi friday night to show support for his cause but not to raise 
money 
he knows he has our support mas canosa said weve 
provided hospital beds food and medicine to his troops in the past 
and we are ready to do it again

prime minister rajiv gandhi reshuffled 
his cabinet today and said he would no longer serve as his own 
foreign minister because he wanted to devote more time to politics 
the cabinet changes gandhis 13th since he took office in 1984 
followed setbacks for his congress party in last weeks 
parliamentary elections 
by divesting himself of the foreign ministers job gandhi can 
turn fuller attention to the challenge posed by his chief political 
rival former defense minister vp singh 
singh who broke with the prime minister last year over the 
governments slowness in investigating allegations that bribes were 
paid in foreign arms deals won a parliamentary seat in the 
allahabad district 
he easily defeated the congress party candidate by a 2to1 
majority boosting his chances of opposing gandhi himself for 
national leadership in the coming 18 months 
national elections must be conducted no later than january 1990 
asked today whether panic over singhs allahabad victory was 
the reason for the cabinet reshuffle gandhi replied not at all 
do i look panicky 
he said he would not resign and would not call an early election 
the countrys two national news agencies the united news of 
india and the press trust of india quoted the prime minister as 
saying he wanted to devote more time to political work 
gandhi assigned the post of foreign minister to pv narasimha 
rao who had served as minister of human resource development in 
the last cabinet 
he was one of nine men given new cabinetlevel responsibilities 
in the reshuffle all are congress party veteran politicians 
two of the new cabinet members finance minister sb chavan and 
commerce minister bir bahadur singh stepped down as chief 
ministers of indian states on friday following allegations they had 
been inept in upholding the congress party banner 
their inclusion 24 hours later in gandhis new cabinet brought a 
scathing retort from lk advani president of a rightwing 
opposition group the bharatiya janata party he called the new 
cabinet a waste basket of rejected chief ministers pti 
reported 
bir bahadur singh was chief minister of uttar pradesh where the 
congress party lost one parliamentary seat and two state assembly 
seats to opposition candidates in the june 16 elections 
chavan was chief minister of maharashtra where a militant hindu 
party the rightwing shiv sena won recent city council elections 
in bombay the state capital 
since gandhi took office in 1984 following the assassination of 
his mother and predecessor prime minister indira gandhi the 
congress party has lost 10 of 14 state elections 
in another key cabinet appointment baburao shankaranand was 
named minister of law justice and water resources 
shankaranand was water resources minister in a previous cabinet 
but resigned last summer to head a parliamentary investigation that 
kickbacks were paid to facilitate indias purchases of artillery 
guns from the swedish company bofors the investigation concluded 
there was no evidence that kickbacks were paid 
following new reports this week in the daily newspaper hindu 
that commissions were paid in the bofors deal gandhi said he had 
asked the central bureau of investigation to look into the matter 
the cabinet now has 20 members including gandhi who retains 
responsibility for science and technology atomic energy and space

plans to install floating toilets for the 
convenience of boaters on reservoirs east and west of here arent 
exactly getting flushed down the tubes by concerned officials 
it may seem that this is something kind of frivolous but when 
you think about it when you gotta go you gotta go maricopa 
county parks director bill richwine said thursday 
for a boater on the northeast corner of lake pleasant your 
only alternative is to go ashore and get behind a cactus or go over 
into the water and do it richwine said 
richwine envisions two floating toilets anchored in the upper 
more remote regions of the lake about 25 miles northwest of phoenix 
each would be a oneholer restroom floating on pontoons they 
would have holding tanks similar to those in the portable toilets 
used at construction sites golf tourneys and concerts 
richwine said he would make the county board of supervisors 
privy to his plans in two weeks in order to apply for a 90000 
state lake improvement fund grant to pay for the restrooms and a 
trailer to haul them 
meanwhile the us forest service is considering putting six 
floating potties on roosevelt lake about 60 miles northeast of 
phoenix said david killebrew of tonto national forest 
the toilets are part of an 18 million improvement plan for the 
popular watersports site killebrew said construction is to begin 
in 1990

a small alligator found snoozing in a 
memphis vegetable garden is just a runofthemill reptile and not 
a missing sexchanged gator stolen from memphis state university a 
biologist says 
the researcher who changed the missing alligators sex examined 
the garden gator and pronounced it a different ordinary reptile 
memphis state biology department chairman jim payne said recently 
the missing alligator was stolen last november from a biology 
laboratory at memphis state 
the 2footlong gator was one of a dozen or so used to study the 
effects of hormones and environment on reptile sex determination 
while still in the egg it was changed from a boy to a girl 
an alligator fitting the missing animals description turned up 
in a garden june 14 but the only person who could confirm the 
reptiles identity biologist william gutzke was in the galapagos 
islands inspecting the sex organs of turtles

an admiral has called for the 
courtmartial of a navy swimming instructor accused of holding a 
recruits head under water and literally scaring him to death a 
navy spokesman said 
four other enlisted men and an officer accused in the death have 
until monday to decide whether to accept more lenient disciplinary 
action or pursue a courtmartial lt cmdr dennis hessler said 
friday 
rear adm david r morris of corpus christi texas chief of 
naval air training also dropped involuntary manslaughter charges 
against the enlisted men except for petty officer 2nd class 
michael w combe for whom he has recommended the courtmartial 
hessler said 
the navy accused combe of holding airman recruit lee mirecki 
19 of appleton wis under water after combe and other 
instructors pushed or tossed the trainee into a pool when he 
panicked and tried to quit the course 
morris recommended the courtmartial to vice adm nr thunman 
chief of naval education and training the ranking officer in 
pensacola said hessler thunmans public affairs officer 
it seems like he felt possibly that combe was the most 
culpable and i have to respect his decision because we are not 
part of the military process lynn johansen mireckis sister 
said in appleton 
the decisions show all six defendants share the blame she said 
these men lacked professional judgment and thats obvious 
she said everyones saying that the system failed but these men 
were part of it 
at a fiveday investigative hearing two weeks ago defense 
attorneys argued the system was at fault because mirecki was 
allowed to return to training through a series of mixups after a 
flight surgeon declared him unfit and because use of force was a 
common practice condoned by authorities to keep scared tired or 
malingering trainees in the pool 
mirecki had been described at the hearing as having died from 
sheer terror a pathologist testified mirecki had a phobia 
about being dragged under water which triggered heart failure 
followed by drowning although there was no determination of which 
factor killed him 
combe and the four other instructors had been charged with 
conspiracy to commit battery and involuntary manslaughter lt 
thomas a torchia the officer in charge of the school was accused 
of dereliction of duty and transferred 
morris offered to resolve the cases of torchia petty officers 
1st class richard e blevins and david j smith and petty officers 
2nd class frankie d deaton and john w zelenock with nonjudicial 
punishment hessler said 
if they decide to accept the offer the extent of punishment 
would be determined at a proceeding known as an admirals nest 
they could face a pay cut reduction in rank restriction to the 
base or other penalties 
a courtmartial would enable a defendant to be cleared if 
acquitted but carries the risk of penalities that include prison 
time and removal from the service for a conviction

workers began to dismantle the exterior of a 
derailed csx tanker in preparation for its move to a safe place 
today after awaiting the burnout of a toxic fire that prompted the 
evacuation of 15000 
the fire had died down enough by late friday to allow workers to 
remove the ruptured steel jacket of the car 
james h mike molloy executive director of the state 
division of disaster and emergency services said a survey team 
determined at midafternoon friday that 20 percent of the caustic 
white phosphorus remained in the tanker 
don armstrong a des spokesman said plans called for placing 
the hull on a flatbed rail car today and shipping it to a safe 
area to remove the remaining phosphorus 
about 40 families displaced when the tanker derailed wednesday 
night creating a toxic cloud that forced the evacuation of 15000 
people from eight western kentucky counties will be allowed to 
return home once the car is removed armstrong said 
meanwhile csx transportation corp conducted a drug test on the 
trains engineer but the results will not be available for several 
weeks said tim hensley a spokesman for csx hensley refused to 
identify the engineer 
the tanker was part of a csx train that officials say was going 
too fast through rural christian county when 34 of its cars 
derailed wednesday night in a ravine near crofton the phosphorus 
spilled from the ruptured tanker and burned for more than 12 hours 
after the crash 
phosphorus inside the tanker reignited thursday night as workers 
righted it and although more toxic smoke billowed over the area 
there were few additional evacuations and no injuries officials 
said 
the csx engineer said he did not see a sign marking the section 
of the track under a slow order and did not receive a computer 
message about it hensley said he said a warning marker was found 
but was not standing 
our position is he failed to receive and comply with a 10 
mph slow order hensley said whether the fault was on his part 
or our part that really hasnt been determined 
he said the wreckage would be put through a battery of tests 
including chemical and xray analyses to determine if there were 
equipment or material failures a tape located in the engineers 
quarters as well as handling and operational procedures will also 
be reviewed he said

poor mothers told a congressional 
committee investigating hunger in appalachia that their families 
would not have enough food to live on if they didnt grow some of 
it themselves 
two congressmen committee staff members and reporters visited 
homes of poor west virginians on friday before they listened to 
experts tell why some people go without food 
the problems with poverty programs all originate with the 
notion that lowincome people are deadbeats lazy and shiftless 
people this is not true said milton ogle director of the 
appalachian research and defense fund based in charleston 
testifying before the us houses select committee on hunger 
ogle said much of west virginias problem stems from the lack of 
money to supplement federal programs thats because much of the 
states wealth its surface land and mineral resources is 
controlled by outofstate corporations 
the absentee holders of wealth display an arrogance based on 
power that causes our state leaders to crumble and turn to mush 
ogle said thus the burden of paying for public services falls 
disproportionately on low and moderateincome people 
the situation in west virginia and other rural states appears to 
be dire said rep mickey leland dtexas 
we have heard from mothers in west virginia that they would 
not be able to adequately feed their families if they didnt have 
their gardens said leland the committee chairman 
for many residents of this state the outlook for prosperity 
in the near future is dismal most families dont even think about 
how things look down the road because they are exhausting every 
thread of energy confronting the daytoday struggles of making 
ends meet but west virginians are a proud people and they will 
stretch themselves to the farthest limits to survive 
earlier the committee toured the homes of several residents to 
learn how they manage to make ends meet when state and federal 
programs are insufficient ocie taylor a 90yearold resident of 
oak hill told the congressmen she cherishes her independence but 
fears that it is threatened by her inability to make ends meet on 
social security a modest veterans administration pension and the 
local meals on wheels program 
when i get so i cant wait on myself i hope the good lord 
takes me taylor said they want me to come live with my 
children but id rather live in my own house 
down the road in robson gwendolyn cole is having an even harder 
time feeding herself and two children her 3yearold son and a 
6yearold girl she took in when the girl was abandoned by her 
mother 
because the little girls mother is reluctant to allow her to be 
adopted cole who lives on 201 a month in welfare benefits and 
228 a month in food stamps has been unable to obtain medical 
coverage for the child 
what if she gets sick i just pray that she dont cole said 
often coles food stamps dont stretch nearly far enough with 
nearly a week remaining before she gets her next allotment of 
stamps she showed visitors a refrigerator virtually empty of 
anything except some bread and bottles of water that she has 
because her water pipes are broken 
i was working but now that ive got the kids i cant said 
the single mother the nearest available day care center is in oak 
hill 20 miles away and cole has no transportation of her own 
whatever job i could get id have to take the bus and 
getting the kids to day care would be hard she said

the government has closed almost all 
universities and institutions of higher learning in this southeast 
asian nation after students rioted in at least four cities over the 
past week local residents said today 
rangoon where rioting erupted tuesday was calm although 
traffic was lighter than normal today a dusktodawn curfew 
remained in force 
residents contacted by telephone said classes had been suspended 
at universities and secondary schools in mandalay the countrys 
second largest city as well as taunggyi moulmein pegu bassein 
myitkyina and akyab 
the government imposed a series of restrictions hours after 
students and other demonstrators clashed with police in rangoon 
last tuesday over the next few days the protests spread to pegu 
located north of rangoon moulmein on the southeastern seacoast 
and the irrawaddy delta center of bassein 
residents in moulmein said outoftown students at the 
university were quickly sent home on buses airplanes and boats by 
authorities they also reported the arrest of several student 
leaders 
there has been no comment to date on the disturbances in the 
governmentcontrolled media and no public announcement since june 
23 on the closure of the schools 
although details were not available authorities in rangoon 
appeared to be searching for student leaders most of whom have 
been expelled from schools and universities following a bloody riot 
in the capital last march 
the latest protests were sparked by the government closure of 
the rangoon arts and science university where students last week 
staged a peaceful demonstration demanding release of arrested 
students and the legalization of student unions 
shouting antigovernment slogans thousands took to the streets 
and battled police with rocks the government announced that nine 
persons were killed and 77 arrested in the third major violent 
protest since last october

with the 26yearold regime of strongman ne win his socialist 
economics have turned a once prosperous country into one of the 
worlds poorest nations and the oneparty rule has curtailed many 
civil liberties 
the stagnant economy has created widespread unemployment or 
underemployment among university graduates who spearheaded the 
weeks antigovernment drive 
the 78yearold ne win came to power in a 1962 coup and has 
since ousted a number of potential rivals but until last year 
overt mass opposition had been sporadic with the last major 
protests prior to october occuring in 1974 
the government has said that the curfew as well as a ban on 
public meetings and demonstrations would last until aug 19 it has 
not said when classes would be resumed

austrian visit to emphasize that christians as well as jews were 
among the victims of nazi persecution 
shortly after arriving in austria on thursday afternoon the 
pontiff began drawing attention to the nonjews who suffered under 
nazi dictator adolf hitler 
the pontiff did not mention jews during his formal televised 
speech during a friday afternoon visit to the site of the former 
mauthausen nazi death camp angering austrias chief rabbi by the 
omission 
today the pontiff again brought up christian suffering during a 
prayer service in the town of lorch 25 miles from the czech border 
not far from here is mauthausen where christians jews and 
others were persecuted for many reaons including their religion 
the pope said their suffering was a gift to the world 
in addition to killing six million jews the nazis also killed 
hundred of thousand of others including gypsies homosexuals 
priests and political opponents 
on his fiveday austrian tour the pope appeared to be trying to 
make sure the memories of the other victims especially christians 
are not forgotten 
amongst the many who were persecuted for religious racial and 
political reasons were large numbers of catholics priests 
members of religious orders and lay people he told president 
kurt waldheim and other austrian politicians thursday evening 
john paul also brought up the issue in a meeting with leaders of 
austrias jewish community friday morning as he talked about 
inquiries into the causes of the nazi dictatorship 
the pope spoke of studies into the the holocaust as well as 
martyrdom of the polish people and other european peoples during 
the nazi era 
many of the poles who were killed though not all were jews 
john paul reminded the jewish community leaders that the nazi 
machine was aimed not only at the jewish people but also against 
the faith of those who worship jesus of nazareth a jew as the 
savior of the world 
then in an emotional visit to the site of the former death camp 
on friday afternoon the only victims he mentioned by name were 
polish priest st maximilian kolbe religious activist marcel callo 
and two other catholics 
he also called attention to all people especially those who 
when world war ii was raging in europe suffered the torture of 
such camps 
austrian chief rabbi chaim eisenberg responded to the mauthausen 
speech by saying a visit to mauthausen without mentioning the 
word jews once is not satisfactory 
the only jew he mentions who suffered is jesus christ and he 
didnt die in mauthausen eisenberg added 
the pontiffs pronouncements come as some historians have been 
promoting revised views of the holocaust and nazi atrocities 
conservative west german historians in particular are saying 
that nazi horrors should be compared with stalinistera mass 
killings in the soviet union and similar atrocities by totalitarian 
regimes 
the historians views have angered many jews who say they are 
denigrating the memory of jews who died in the holocaust 
it is not known whether the pope is versed in this historical 
debate 
however after condemning the nazi atrocities at mauthausen 
john paul used the phrase here and in so many places under 
totalitarian rule 
later in the speech he added if a machine of destruction 
still exists anywhere in the world tell us what can our century 
pass on to the generations to come

a lawyer arrived home today after 
he was expelled by fiji as he tried to represent chiefs charged 
with plotting to form a new government and other men accused of gun 
smuggling 
attorney christopher harder 39 was deported from the south 
pacific island of fiji and flown to auckland about 1300 miles to 
the south he said he had been held by the fijian military for 
three days 
he went to the archipelago to represent eight chiefs from the 
island of rotuma charged with plotting to break away from the 
central government sources in rotuma said men had plotted in may 
to declare rotumas secession from fiji a british colony until 
1970 
harder also intended to act as attorney for five men of indian 
descent charged after the discovery of sovietmade weapons on fiji 
earlier this month 
he said he had arrived monday and attempted the next day to 
arrange a meeting with fijian military leader lt col sitiveni 
rabuka but his calls went unanswered he said 
on wednesday morning he said two plainclothes security men 
arrested him at his hotel and drove him to the army barracks he 
said he was not mistreated by authorities 
harder did not say whether he had been given an explanation for 
his detention and deportation 
however he was arrested after he wrote a letter to the local 
judiciary objecting to a new security decree that affected his 
clients 
the measures imposed wednesday allow mandatory life 
imprisonment for arms smuggling detention without trial for up to 
four years sweeping powers of arrest and search and restriction 
of freedom of expression

a man who has been arrested 11 times on 
drunken driving charges since 1978 was sentenced to jail for the 
first time for reckless driving 
traffic court judge louis trent on thursday revoked gary roths 
probation from a reckless driving conviction on april 12 and 
ordered him to serve 90 days in jail 
roth 33 had been given a 90day suspended sentence after the 
city attorneys office agreed to allow him to plead guilty to a 
reduced charge of reckless driving he was arrested feb 2 on 
charges of driving while intoxicated 
prosecutors said they did not take roth to court on the earlier 
dwi charge because roth had refused to take any breath or field 
sobriety tests leaving prosecutors with insufficient evidence 
roths lawyer had assured the court that his client would place 
himself in an institution for drug rehabilitation as a condition of 
the reckless driving conviction but testimony thursday indicated 
roth had failed to do so 
since 1978 roth has been arrested 11 times for dwi but has been 
convicted only once following a 1982 accident on the seabrook 
bridge in which two people were injured 
he also faces trial on dwi charges stemming from arrests on may 
17 and june 6

peace in southern africa 
the delegates from south africa angola cuba and the united 
states faced widely divergent proposals presented in fridays 
opening session conference sources said 
the participants are seeking a formula for ending a 13year 
civil war in angola and ushering in independence to southwest 
africa or namibia 
the leading cairo newspaper alahram reported today that the 
cubans offered to withdraw their troops from angola over four 
years but that the south africans wanted a pullout in eight months 
the south africans and the joint angolancuban delegation 
consulted separately friday night with chester crocker the us 
assistant secretary of state for african affairs crocker is acting 
as mediator 
in keeping with a news blackout imposed friday the sources said

closer for todays second and final day of negotiations two 
previous rounds of peace talks in london and brazzaville congo

two candidates vied for the presidency 
of iceland in todays election and opinion polls predicted a 
landslide victory for incumbent vigdis finnbogadottir 
some of the 170000 eligible voters on this sparsely populated 
island cast ballots shortly after polls opened at 9 am 5 am 
edt polls close at 11 pm 7 pm edt with results expected 
one hour later 
the presidency is largely ceremonial real power rests with the 
prime minister thorsteinn palsson 
the challenger 46yearold housewife sigrun thorsteinsdottir 
captured eveofelection headlines when her friday afternoon rally 
in the icelandic capital was disrupted by a bomb scare 
police said they received an anonymous telephone call claiming 
that a bomb had been planted in laekjartorg the main square in 
downtown reykjavik where about 100 supporters and spectators had 
gathered police searched the square but no bomb was found 
recent opinion polls suggest mrs thorsteinsdottir will secure 
less than 3 percent of the vote 
ms finnbogadottir 57 is campaigning for a third fouryear 
term she defeated three male candidates in 1980 to become the 
north atlantic islands fourth president and the worlds first 
female state president in 1984 she won automatic reelection when 
no rivals registered 
todays election marks the first time an incumbent president has 
faced a reelection challenge since this nation of 243000 became a 
republic in 1944 
mrs thorsteinsdottir is a member of the antiestablishment 
humanist party which has so far failed to win a seat in the 
63seat althing or parliament 
she has challenged ms finnbogadottirs role as a figurehead 
president with traditionally limited powers arguing that the 
constitution apportions far greater power on the presidency than 
commonly supposed 
but constitutional experts say that although the president has 
power to introduce bills to the legislature form governments and 
subject proposed legislation to a plebiscite the constitution 
makes clear that the prime minister and the cabinet are solely 
responsible for all government action 
all the major political party leaders have expressed support for 
the status quo and some have ventured to suggest that mrs 
thorsteinsdottirs campaign is based on ignorance of the 
constitution 
icelandic women have in recent years begun to carve out a larger 
slice of political power the leftwing womens alliance which 
made history in 1983 when it became the first feminist movement in 
the world to win parliamentary seats doubled its tally to six 
seats in last years general election 
the reykjavik daily newspaper morgunbladid recently published a 
poll showing the opposition womens alliance equal with the 
independence party with each enjoying the support of about 30 
percent of the electorate 
the independence party is the countrys largest political party 
and a dominant force in the threeparty coalition government

medication sometimes prescribed to lower high 
blood pressure in younger patients paradoxically may increase the 
risk of heart attack by harming blood fat levels researchers say 
high blood pressure can be accompanied by abnormal blood fat 
levels that left undetected and untreated could pose a greater 
danger than hypertension dr roger r williams of the university 
of utah said friday 
two types of drugs commonly used to treat hypertension 
diuretics and beta blockers often adversely affect the 
relationship among the three blood fats highdensity lipoprotein 
cholesterol or good cholesterol triglycerides and lowdensity 
lipoprotein cholesterol or bad cholesterol he said 
the three are the components of total blood cholesterol 
cholesterol is manufactured by the body and necessary for building 
cells making hormones and helping digestion but in excess it is 
a contributor to fatty buildup in blood vessels that can lead to 
heart attacks 
high blood pressure which afflicts about 20 percent of all us 
adults is a leading cause of heart attack and stroke 
but by giving hypertensive patients with abnormal blood fat 
levels diuretics and beta blockers doctors may be further knocking 
the proportion among the three blood fats out of line and 
contributing to the risk of heart attack the researcher said 
the level of abnormality of lipids puts them at much greater 
risk of heart attack than high blood pressure said williams 
director of the universitys cardiovascular genetics research 
clinic 
the point is that doctors are getting their patients high 
blood pressure treated but their underlying lipid blood fat 
abnormalities are not being treated he said 
williams and fellow researchers found high levels of bad 
cholesterol and triglycerides and low levels of good cholesterol in 
many of the subjects they studied while they were looking for 
inherited factors in high blood pressure 
the team reported its findings in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
their study used sets of siblings diagnosed with high blood 
pressure all of whom had received treatment before the age of 60 
of a total of 131 subjects 69 had abnormalities in cholesterol and 
triglyceride levels in addition to their high blood pressure 
but only three of those 69 were getting treated for the blood 
fat abnormalities williams said 
unfortunately thats not surprising said dr rw wissler 
a noted cardiovascular pathologist at the university of chicago 
its only been a few years since doctors learned about any 
relationship between antihypertensives and the lipids and it is 
just now being reported in more detail he said things 
sometimes build up slowly in medicine which makes it all the more 
important that this be given more attention

workers chipping away at old floor tiles in the 
hallway of a suburban high school sent clouds of dust containing 
cancercausing asbestos into the air federal officials charged 
the us environmental protection agency lodged a complaint and 
proposed a 5000 fine against thornton township high school in 
harvey a spokeswoman said friday it is the first complaint the 
epa has brought under new asbestossafety rules that went into 
effect in december 
the complaint says students and other school personnel were 
exposed to asbestos fibers during the improper removal of 6400 
square feet of hallway flooring 
we had received several calls from teachers and students and 
actually the workers in the school that the tile was being removed 
in the hallway and clouds of dust were being raised and they were 
very concerned about it said epa spokeswoman nancy sullivan 
school officials have until july 11 to respond to the complaint 
which names thornton high school district 205 the school was 
closed friday afternoon and officials could not be reached for 
comment 
the violations were discovered during an epa inspection march 1 
and the school immediately discontinued the flooring removal 
project at the agencys request the epa said 
asbestos a mineral that has been used in building materials 
can cause lung cancer and other disorders when airborne fibers 
enter the body 
when the tile was removed in february school officials did not 
initially know that it contained asbestos ms sullivan said 
later officials had the tile tested and the presence of asbestos 
was confirmed she said 
workers who were not accredited by the government to remove 
asbestos had sanded chipped and cut the tiles releasing clouds 
of dust containing asbestos the epa said in a news release 
the complaint against thornton is the epas first enforcement 
action nationwide under the asbestos hazard emergency response act 
the agency said 
under the law which took effect dec 14 specific safety 
measures must be taken when removing asbestos from elementary and 
secondary schools 
if they decide to contest the complaint school officials can 
seek an informal hearing with epa officials in chicago or request a 
hearing before a federal administrative law judge ms sullivan 
said

principal joe clark who roams the halls 
of eastside high school with a baseball bat and bullhorn traded 
his instruments of discipline for rhetoric in his commencement 
address to 405 graduating seniors 
as nearly 1000 friends relatives and students crowded onto an 
athletic field for eastsides 102nd graduation friday clark 
described the pain of poverty he experienced as youth in newark and 
how it motivated him 
regardless of the vicissitudes regardless of the 
difficulties i declare that this little brat welfare boy from 
newark was not going to give up and he was going to go to the 
pinnacle of success clark said 
clark who in the past few months has appeared on the cover of 
time magazine received a job offer from the white house and 
inspired an upcoming hollywood movie about his tough ways struck a 
chord with the departing seniors 
im going to miss him said diedra m bethea 17 who plans 
to study chemistry at trenton state college hes just like a 
father to me 
clark has been credited with bringing law and order to a rowdy 
innercity school and was held up as an example of a tough urban 
educator by the reagan administration 
he banned underachieving students chained doors shut to 
drugdealers and strode the halls with a bullhorn and baseball bat 
but the paterson school board considered disciplinary action 
against clark for kicking out more than 60 students without going 
through proper procedures though it eventually dropped its effort 
even the movie film crews presence at the school drew controversy 
we learned something from it said erving ruiz 18 
referring to the disputes you have to go to battle sometimes 
the principal lauded the students and told them the success of 
paterson rests in their hands 
we have pricked the conscience of a nation and we have shown 
if nothing more that black and hispanic students in inner cities 
can behave properly clark said 
several parents at the graduation praised the principal 
hes put the school back on its feet said larry smith who 
graduated from eastside two decades ago and whose daughter 
lavetta will attend penn state in the fall to study engineering

pope john paul ii today paid tribute to 
jewish and other victims of austrias most notorious nazi 
concentration camp saying their suffering was a gift to the 
world 
the roman catholic leader spoke after jewish leaders criticized 
his formal speech the day before during a visit to the site of the 
former mauthausen camp where thousands of jews were among the 
110000 inmates who perished the speech omitted any specific 
reference to jews 
the criticism prompted vatican spokesman joaquin navarro to tell 
reporters today that the pontiff had no intention of slighting the 
jews navarro said the pontiff mentioned the jews who died at 
mauthausen during a brief stop at a memorial plaque set up in their 
memory 
john paul spoke before 80000 people today in the town of lorch 
just 25 miles from the czechoslovak border on the third day of his 
visit to austria 
not far from here is mauthausen where christians jews and 
others were persecuted for many reasons including their 
religion the pope said referring to his visit to the 
concentration camp site 
he continued their suffering was a gift to the world 
john paul has been using the current fiveday austria trip to 
discuss various aspects of the nazi past the country is marking 
the 50th anniversary year of its annexation by nazi germany in 1938 
after his arrival thursday the pontiff despite protests of 
some jewish leaders met with controversial president kurt 
waldheim the austrian president has faced allegations of 
complicity in nazi war crimes but has denied wrongdoing 
on friday waldheim received holy communion from the pontiff 
during an outdoor mass for 80000 people in the town of trausdorf 
near the border with hungary 
in lorch john paul also addressed the concerns of workers and 
farmers in the area many of the farmers in the far northern region 
are having trouble staying in business often forced to take second 
jobs to make ends meet 
the church stands by you when you have social and economic 
problems the whiterobed pontiff said during the outdoor prayer 
service 
john paul frequently has called for respect for workers rights 
and warned about the potential dangers of unbridled 
profitmotivated capitalism 
the polishborn pontiff set off a wave of jewish protest friday 
when he failed to mention jews during the mauthausen speech 
the failure of pope john paul to make any specific reference 
to the suffering of the jews while visiting the site of the 
infamous mauthausen concentration camp is a matter of deep shock to 
the jewish community said world jewish congress executive 
director elan steinberg 
this together with the popes unwillingness to confront kurt 
waldheim over his nazi past or address the historical complicity of 
austria in the crimes of hitlers germany are failures that 
constitute a tragic lost moral opportunity steinberg added in a 
statement from new york 
also faulting the pontiff on friday was austrias chief rabbi 
chaim eisenberg who leads the countrys 12000 jews 
on friday while at mauthausen the pontiff cited only four 
concentration camp victims by name all of them catholics however 
he stopped in silence for nearly a minute at a plaque set up in 
memory of the jewish victims 
navarro said the pope standing beside a camp survivor in front 
of the plaque spoke of the jews and said never again three 
times 
navarro said the survivor was supposed to have been wearing a 
tiny microphone so that the popes words could have been heard but 
that for some reason officials had removed the device

jesse jackson and michael dukakis have agreed 
to overhaul democratic party rules for 1992 eliminating provisions 
that jackson said prevented him from getting as many delegates as 
he deserved a dukakis spokesman said today 
the changes include cutting the number of super delegates by 
nearly half and requiring that all other delegates in all states 
be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion to the votes 
they receive 
the agreement between the two campaigns virtually assures that 
the proposed changes would be ratified by the partys national 
convention in atlanta next month 
dukakis campaign spokesman tad devine said that the 
massachusetts governor would have won the nomination even if those 
proposed rules were in place this year 
the reason that mike dukakis is the nominee of the party is he 
was the overwhelming choice of the voters said devine who is in 
charge of delegate selection for dukakis presidential campaign 
jackson had complained that the rules which allowed party 
leaders and elected officials to hold automatic seats as national 
convention super delegates were unfair of the 643 super delegates 
to the convention dukakis is supported by 362 while jackson has 
just 55 according to the associated press delegate count 
in addition jackson said that some states which hold direct 
election of delegates and others which weight the process toward 
the overall winner do not hand out delegates fairly the proposed 
changes would require all of the states to adopt rules that would 
award delegates proportionally 
if adopted by the rules committee and ratified by the national 
convention the rules would take effect in 1992 
devine said that the agreement between the two campaigns was 
reached after several days of negotiations he said it represented 
compromise on both sides

president reagan hailed his final economic 
summit as a triumph for his longheld freemarket philosophy but 
in one key respect his current policy is radically different from 
the early days of his administration 
the president who once was content to sit idly by while the 
dollar soared in value has become an active meddler in currency 
markets anathema in the early days of reagonomics then the cry 
was let the markets decide the fair exchange value of the 
dollar left untouched by government 
but the final economic communique issued after the toronto 
summit by the leaders of the united states japan west germany 
britian france italy and canada brags that their policy of joint 
intervention has been a success and should be continued 
intervention is the process by which countries buy and sell 
currencies on the open market in an effort to influence their price 
reagan and his first treasury secretary donald t regan 
disdained such actions during the presidents first term 
contending that the dollars surge in value during those years was 
a sign of economic strength 
the administration turned a deaf ear to pleas from american 
manufacturers and farmers who contended that they were being 
battered by an overvalued dollar which had made their goods 
uncompetitive on world markets 
at the dollars highest point in february 1985 reagan replied 
that the greenbacks strength wasnt a problem it was a 
blessing demonstrating how attractive the united states was to 
foreign investors 
critics contended that this handsoff policy was eroding 
americas industrial base and bringing on record trade deficits as 
american manufacturers and farmers were priced out of more and more 
foreign markets 
treasury secretary james a baker iii who replaced regan in 
early 1985 decided that with protectionist forces gaining the 
upper hand in congress it was time for a new approach 
the change turned out to be a surprise announcement by the 
united states and its major allies in september 1985 at the plaza 
hotel in new york that they would jointly intervene in currency 
markets to drive the dollar lower in an effort to make american 
products competitive once again 
the administration changed views quite radically because of 
the nearrecession in certain sectors of the economy in late 1984 
and 1985 said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
they went to work to fix the problems in trade manufacturing and 
farming 
since that time the dollar has fallen by 50 percent against the 
japanese yen and german mark and by somewhat smaller margins 
against other currencies 
the effort began to pay off in the middle of 1986 as us 
exports in volume terms started improving even though the trade 
deficit in dollar terms continued to worsen because the weaker 
dollar made imports more expensive 
but after posting a record deficit of 1703 billion in 1987 
the deficit for the first four months of this year has declined 
sharply to an annual rate of 1418 billion 
with that improvement has come a surge in the us growth rate 
as manufacturing companies have been busy hiring to meet the 
increased export demands 
in february 1987 the summit nations switched from a policy of 
trying to drive the dollar lower to one of stabilizing the dollar 
for fear that any further decline would threaten a resurgence of 
inflation in the united states and frighten away the foreign 
investors the country has come to depend on 
for most of last year that effort was a failure as market forces 
continued to push the dollar lower the dollars continued decline 
forced the federal reserve to step in and tighten interest rates to 
prevent a surge in inflation this combination of a weak currency 
and rising interest rates has been blamed in a part for the october 
stock market collapse 
the market crash raising fears of a global recession convinced 
the summit countries of the critical need for stronger efforts at 
stabilizing the dollars value they issued a dec 22 communique 
pledging closer cooperation and that so far has done the trick 
in the toronto economic communique the countries repeated their 
pledge for close economic coordination building on commitments 
made at the tokyo summit in 1986 and the venice summit last year 
baker said he believed the coordination process has proved so 
successful that it would last long after reagan was out of office 
but some critics are not so sure contending that policy 
squabbles are inevitable when dealing with sovereign nations 
the notion of coordination is something we keep talking about 
but it doesnt really exist no country is willing to be lectured 
to by the other side said george perry an economist at the 
brookings institution a washington think tank 
what we really have is a heavy openmouth policy on the part 
of government officials providing guidance to the markets and that 
has been backed up by intervention 
perry said that this fragile arrangement can come apart at any 
time with the resultant discord jolting markets as it did last 
october 
but president reagan and the other world leaders concluded their 
gathering on a more upbeat note praising the strengthened ties 
of solidarity both political and economic between them

a beirut magazine reported today that the 
iranian government hopes to influence the us presidential 
elections by releasing british hostages close to the nov 8 vote 
the weekly ashshiraa reported that the agreement to release the 
hostages emerged during a threeday unofficial visit by four 
british legislators to iran that ended wednesday 
reliable moslem fundamentalist circles have confirmed that 
britishiranian negotiations to free british hostages held in 
lebanon will result in their release on the eve of the american 
presidential elections the report said 
the magazine gained international fame when it broke the story 
of secret us arms sales to iran in return for releasing american 
hostages in 1986 the magazines more recent reports on hostage 
developments have proved inaccurate 
the four british legislators returned to london wednesday saying 
iranian officials offered to use their influence to release the 
three british captives in lebanon 
ashshiraa said the iranian leadersip was seeking to postpone 
the release until late summer so that it will be the biggest voter 
in the coming american presidential elections 
ashshiraa said the iranian move of postponing the release 
aims at besieging and embarrassing the official american stand 
of the reagan administration for failing to obtain the release 
of american hostages 
the united states and britain had agreed not to negotiate for 
the hostages release however france negotiated with iran for 
the release of french hostages and that was achieved the report 
said 
french diplomats marcel fontaine and marcel carton as well as 
journalist jeanpaul kauffmann were released in beirut may 4 
britains foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe on thursday 
denied that britain was negotiating for the release of anglican 
church envoy terry waite journalist john mccarthy and teacher 
brian keenan 
no group has claimed responsibility for abducting waite and 
mccarthy although they are widely believed held by fanatic shiite 
moslem kidnappers affiliated with the iranianbacked hezbollah or 
party of god 
the magazine report compared the anticipated release to that of 
of 52 americans held hostage in the us embassy in tehran for 444 
days they were released on inauguration day as president jimmy 
carter left office 
the aim of the delay was to bring carter down and the hostages 
were only released after a new president president reagan took 
over the magazine article concluded 
in all 18 foreigners are missing and believed kidnapped in 
lebanon including nine americans the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985

a cartoon in the toronto star captured the scene 
with dynamite bulging out of her purse a smiling margaret thatcher 
marches away from the canadian parliament as an explosion blows the 
top off the building 
such was the impact of the british prime ministers 
characteristically forthright expression of conservative views last 
week in a speech to a joint session of parliament 
not since french president charles de gaulle intervened in the 
quebec separatist debate in 1967 by declaring vive le quebec 
libre long live a free quebec has a foreign leader stirred so 
much controversy 
fresh from the toronto economic summit mrs thatcher was in 
ottawa for talks with conservative prime minister brian mulroney 
and to accept an invitation to address parliament 
a standing ovation greeted her but mrs thatcher quickly 
angered opposition parties by endorsing mulroneys free trade 
agreement with the united states and his decision to buy a 66 
billion fleet of nuclearpowered submarines 
both the main opposition liberal party and the socialist new 
democratic party were outraged and a furious exchange erupted two 
hours later during commons question period 
what right does she have to come here and meddle in canadian 
affairs new democratic party leader ed broadbent shouted 
liberal leader john turner asked if mulroney had vetted 
thatchers remarks they were so partisan 
we are no longer a colony of great britain and we do not want 
to become a colony of the united states turner said 
both opposition parties say they will tear up the trade deal and 
cancel the submarine program if they win the next election which 
mulroney may call as early as this fall the new democrats also 
want to take canada out of the nato alliance 
mrs thatcher paid special tribute to canadas contribution to 
the north atlantic treaty organization including its decision to 
permit tests of us cruise missiles and bolster its navy with 
nuclearpowered subs 
she also took a broad swipe at the the debilitating concept of 
the allpowerful state before embracing the canadaus free 
trade agreement which would dismantle trade barriers over a 
10year period 
the liberals and new democrats say the deal sacrifices 
independence and threatens to make canada the 51st state of the 
union 
on the basis of britains experience of joining the european 
community you need have no fear that canadas national personality 
will be in any way diminished mrs thatcher said 
fifteen years of ec membership have left our people no less 
british and no less proud of their history and independence 
moreover protectionism is not a life belt which keeps an economy 
afloat it is a millstone that drags you down and penalizes 
consumers and work force alike 
liberal lloyd axworthy likened mrs thatchers intervention to a 
canadian prime minister telling the british what to do about 
northern ireland 
in defense of mrs thatcher deputy prime minister don 
mazankowski called the opposition whiners and complainers 
ironically there were no protests a week earlier when west 
german chancellor helmut kohl addressed the same chamber and in a 
more general way endorsed both the free trade agreement and 
canadas contribution to nato 
sensitivities were much greater toward mrs thatcher since it 
was only in 1981 that canada repatriated its constitution from 
britain and since queen elizabeth ii remains canadas head of state 
the opposition suggested that mrs thatcher may have been trying 
to butter up mulroney in hopes he will opt for the british 
trafalgarclass submarine over its french rival the rubisamethyst 
by weeks end furor over the speech had turned to humor 
toronto columnist gary lautens offered mrs thatcher some advice on 
a few problems of her own 
he suggested a twoyear sabbatical for composer andrew lloyd 
webber of phantom of the opera and cats fame so 
somebody else can have a chance to write a musical lautens also 
asked mrs thatcher to ban the use of incomprehensible british 
expressions such as lift elevator tube subway train 
and bonnet car hood 
while im at it lautens added send some brits to this 
country immediately so we can teach them how to make a good 
hamburg not one of those wimpy things

michael dukakis and jesse jackson took steps today to avoid a 
contentious debate over democratic party rules as party officials 
met to draft a platform that dukakis will stand on in the fall 
the two democratic presidential rivals reached an agreement to 
eliminate beginning in 1992 provisions that jackson said prevented 
him from getting as many delegates as he deserved according to 
dukakis spokesman tad devine 
the new rules being worked on by party officials in washington 
are now virtually assured of ratification by the partys national 
convention in atlanta next month they would cut the number of 
super delegates by nearly half and require that all other 
delegates in all other states be awarded in proportion to votes 
they receive 
meanwhile in denver the partys platform panel is taking up a 
preliminary draft document pledging that democrats would restore 
competence caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive 
branch and get it working again fairly for all americans 
dukakis was vacationing today in massachusetts on friday he 
said bill bradley appears uninterested in being the one to run for 
the no 2 spot on the ticket and he was attacked by republican 
george bush who said we dont need more taxes we need a 
president who can hold the line against congressional 
overspending 
jackson who was in puerto rico today has complained that his 
delegate total this year does not reflect his strength at the polls 
devine said that the massachusetts governor would have won the 
nomination even if those proposed rules were in place this year 
the reason that mike dukakis is the nominee of the party is he 
was the overwhelming choice of the voters said devine who is in 
charge of delegate selection for dukakis presidential campaign 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas and christian broadcaster 
pat robertson whipped by bush in the battle for the delegates who 
will pick the republican presidential nominee in new orleans in 
midaugust praised the vice president at a party unity rally 
friday in cincinnati 
the republican party is united and we are not about to see the 
country go for a mediocre liberal like michael dukakis said 
robertson id accept the nomination but its already gone 
quipped dole 
former secretary of state alexander haig jr said today that 
bush is the candidate of safe change 
god help us if michael dukakis wins he is the candiate of 
radical and dangerous change haig said 
dukakis said thursday he supports 115 million in new taxes to 
make sure the states fiscal base is solid and strong 
announcing he would sign a 40 million cigarette levy and favored 
raising another 75 million by bringing the states tax code into 
line with federal tax law changes 
in cincinnati on friday bush attacked dukakis on the tax issue 
saying i will not raise your taxes period he just has in his 
home state at a news conference bush said dukakis refuses to 
rule out a tax hike for the nation we know what that means 
asked if he would rule out all forms of tax increases even 
excise taxes bush said he would but would not extend that pledge 
to user fees such as those charged for entering national parks 
bush said he had a plain as day difference with dukakis 
tax cuts vs tax hikes and added he is not concerned his stand 
would lock him in if he is elected i think its reassuring to 
the working men and women in this country bush said 
at the unity rally bush said i promise you ill not raise 
taxes as a first second or last resort we dont need more 
taxes we need a president who can hold the line against 
congressional overspending 
back in massachusetts dukakis opened a fourday vacation on 
nantucket island and said friday that it appears bradley a senator 
from new jersey isnt interested in joining the democratic ticket 
as the vice presidential candidate 
we havent talked personally about it said dukakis hes 
somebody i have a lot of respect for dukakis said bradley 
apparently told paul brountas a senior adviser leading dukakis 
search for a vice presidential candidate that he wasnt interested 
in the vice presidential slot 
i respect that dukakis said 
in any event were going to keep in touch he added 
dukakis also said that jackson reported by the boston globe to 
have said privately he would turn down the vice presidential 
nomination had not sent any such word to the dukakis campaign and 
i dont know anything about that published report 
in san juan puerto rico jackson denied on friday he had told 
aides he would reject the vice presidential spot on the dukakis 
ticket asked about the report quoting unidentified aides as saying 
he would turn it down jackson responded no absolutely not 
therefore whoever was talking was not authorized but also was not 
dealing in the truth 
said jackson the matter of the vice presidency is a serious 
matter the destiny of our nation perhaps the rest of the world 
rests on the campaign in july and in november to that extent 
there will be no intrigue about that decision 
jackson also said friday that he has picked up eight of puerto 
ricos 57 delegates to the democratic convention and his campaign 
said he wants at least 17 jackson had won a march 20 beauty 
contest primary in puerto rico but the entire delegation had 
voiced support for dukakis for the presidential nomination 
in denver a 16member drafting panel unanimously approved a 
preliminary version of the proposed democratic platform friday in 
advance of todays meeting of the 186member platform committee 
some differences still divided the dukakis and jackson camps but 
campaign staffs said they were continuing their negotiations 
the preliminary document avoids discussion of higher taxes a 
freeze on pentagon spending or a palestinian homeland it urges 
more stable defense budgets calls for appointing a drug czar 
and says south africa is a terrorist state without mentioning

the defense contractors under investigation in 
the pentagon procurement case have poured millions of dollars into 
the pockets and campaign treasuries of members of congress legally 
doing on capitol hill what would be crimes elsewhere in official 
washington 
the principal beneficiaries are the lawmakers who make crucial 
decisions about pentagon spending and procurement priorities 
through their memberships on the house and senate armed services 
committees and defense appropriations subcommittees 
last year 37 of the 101 members who serve on the four military 
committees reported receiving about 137100 in speaking fees from 
defense contractors publicly linked to the pentagon probe 
all but 10000 went to the house side of the capitol with 33 
members democrats and republicans alike averaging 3852 each 
in socalled honoraria 
the associated press surveyed the 1987 financial disclosure 
statements of committee members and campaign contribution reports 
filed with the federal election commission for the 1988 1986 and 
1984 elections 
the reports were filed by political action committees maintained 
by six of the defense contractors who have been searched under 
warrant issued in the massive probe of alleged pentagon procurement 
fraud and bribery 
they are mcdonnell douglas the nations no 1 defense 
contractor litton industries united technologiespratt whitney 
northrop cubic corp and hazeltine corp 
the survey hit only the tip of the iceberg the companies tied 
so far to the probe are part of a huge defense industry with 
dozens of other firms routinely making campaign contributions and 
paying honoraria to members of congress 
congressional leaders said last week that they had been told by 
the chief prosecutor henry hudson that no lawmakers were targets 
of the 2yearold investigation or had had their records seized by 
the fbi 
speaking fees are legal on capitol hill but they are forbidden 
by law among executive branch officials senators can pocket up to 
35800 a year in such outside income house members up to 26850 
the destination of the speaking fees often accompanied by free 
trips for lawmakers and their spouses to defense plants and resorts 
tells a lot about where the real power of the pentagon purse lies 
on capitol hill 
twentytwo of the 52 members of house armed services committee 
reported getting speaking fees from the surveyed defense 
contractors this panel sets broad policy and authorizes items like 
weapons systems 
but a new tank is worthless unless there is money to build it 
and that money on the house side of the capitol comes from the 
smallest military panel in congress the 11member house defense 
appropriations subcommittee headed by rep william chappell dfla 
last year chappell and eight colleagues on the subcommittee 
reported getting 46250 an average of 5138 apiece from 
contractors tied to the investigation 
chappell may head the committee but he wasnt the favorite 
speaker among the contractors with subpoenaed records that was 
rep john murtha dpa who said he collected 8000 for four 
appearances chappell reported 4000 
others on the subcommittee getting money from the surveyed 
contractors included reps charles wilson dtexas 7000 les 
aucoin dore 6250 bob livingston dla 6000 and bill 
young rfla 6000 
youngs disclosure statement illustrated a practice among 
defense contractors who may fight each other for pentagon jobs but 
can cooperate when it comes to taking a lawmaker on a grand tour 
between jan 12 and jan 16 1987 nine ontractors seven of 
them not named in the probe shared the costs of flying housing 
and feeding young for a trip that included visits to facilities in 
california and texas 
for nine speeches in the fiveday stretch young picked up 
13000 in honoraria according to his disclosure statement 
speaking fees are small change for defense contractors compared 
to what they pour into campaign treasuries 
in the last three election cycles nearly 3 million was spent 
on all candidates by political action committees representing six 
of the companies linked to the pentagon investigation according to 
fec reports 
nearly half of this money 47 percent was channeled to 
members of the four military committees members of these panels 
received average contributions of 1293 compared to an average of 
961 for lawmakers not on the military committees 
the biggest spread was in 19834 by northrops pac an average 
of 2014 for members of military committees 876 for nonmembers 
again the defense appropriations subcommittees were favored pac 
targets the average contribution to a lawmaker on these panels was 
1866 
house defense appropriations was allbut blanketed with pac 
money with funds usually going to eight or more of the 11 members 
for the 18member senate counterpart no pac gave to more than 
eight members in the same election cycle 
a pac can give a candidate up to 10000 in each twoyear 
election cycle the survey found three instances northrops pac to 
sen john warner rva in 1984 and united technologiespratt amp 
whitneys pac to warner and sen ted stevens ralaska the same 
year 
military committee members consistently getting 
higherthanaverage pac contributions included sen pete wilson 
rcalif sen alfonse damato rny murtha chappell rep roy 
dyson dmd and rep bill dickinson rala 
two lawmakers on armed services committees sen lawton chiles 
dfla and rep barbara boxer dcalif took neither honoraria 
nor pac money from the defense contractors identified with the 
investigation the records showed

when ziad abed got engaged 
he was looking forward to the music and dancing of a lavish 
palestinian wedding but the arab uprising changed that and he 
married in a simple ceremony last month 
i didnt think it was the right time for dancing and music 
when palestinians are being killed and wounded said abed a 
26yearold school bus driver from bethlehem 
the 6monthold uprising has radically changed the lives of all 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip not just 
those directly involved in confrontations with israel 
the uprising has had a great impact on our social and economic 
structures said saib erakat a political science professor at 
the west banks annajah university the old traditions are 
fading away 
palestinians say their communities once dominated by religious 
leaders and wealthy merchants are now run by young activists many 
from poor backgrounds 
today you are not judged by how rich or famous you are you 
are judged by how active you are in the uprising said amjad 
sarawi 26 an activist and unemployed laborer from the dheishe 
refugee camp near bethlehem 
the uprising also has affected daily routines 
fatima musa 47 of dheishe said she used to go shopping every 
saturday but now she has to wait for plo leaflets announcing 
commercial strikes before she can make out her shopping list 
the uprising created a new daily life mrs musa a mother 
of seven said while peeling potatoes in her sparsely furnished 
living room we have a different strike day every week and that 
means i cant have a steady schedule 
because of widespread strikes and curfews many families have 
organized car pools with their neighbors to do the shopping others 
are stocking up on basic food items 
ata moghrabi 62 a retired laborer keeps two bags each of 
sugar rice and flour in his garage we dont know what is 
awaiting us tomorrow moghrabi said 
since the start of the uprising money has become tight and 
palestinians only buy essentials 
many young women no longer wear makeup some as an expression of 
mourning for the more than 200 palestinians killed in the uprising 
others put away their lipstick after being threatened by young 
militants in bethlehem last month two masked youths approached 
two teenage girls in the citys central market and ordered them to 
wipe off their makeup as a sign of respect for the uprising the 
terrified girls complied 
the uprising has also put an end to most entertainment many 
movie theaters and restaurants are closed and the traditional 
saturday night parties have been canceled 
abeds wedding last month was a subdued affair in which the 
newlyweds closest relatives briefly stopped by for soft drinks and 
cake after the ceremony 
it was a far cry from traditional weddings a cornerstone of 
palestinian social life in which hundreds of relatives and friends 
are served elaborate meals and are entertained by bands 
abed said a man identifying himself only as a palestinian 
nationalist called a few days before the ceremony and demanded that 
it be kept simple without music or dancing 
i warn you and if you dont follow these instructions youll 
regret it abed quoted the caller as saying 
abed said he was not angered by the threat and that he had 
already decided on a simple ceremony as a sign of respect for those 
mourning relatives killed in the uprising 
another newlywed khalil abu akar 27 welcomed the changes 
saying they had saved him a lot of money 
abu akar said he spent 3500 on his may wedding and his wifes 
dowry compared with the 15000 his brother muayed a 25yearold 
mechanic paid when he got married a year ago 
thanks to the glorious uprising today you can get married 
without having to buy your bride said abu akar a junior high 
school teacher in dheishe 
the uprising has not only affected private lives but also has 
overhauled the structure of palestinian society said erakat 
socalled popular committees run by young palestinians have 
replaced traditional community leaders such as village elders 
moslem preachers and wealthy businessmen 
the committees have organized food distribution to the needy 
first aid to those hurt in clashes with soldiers and night patrols 
alerting residents to possible army raids 
young organizers also enforce commercial strikes and summon 
residents to participate in marches and demonstrations 
the committees are replacing the old authority said sarawi 
who heads a committee organizing aid to families whose members have 
been killed wounded or imprisoned 
yusef salah 22 a popular committee member in the village of el 
khader near bethlehem said the changes were not temporary 
we are a bornagain people he said we think differently 
and we behave differently

michael dukakis enjoying an early lead over 
george bush in their presidential duel owes much of his success 
among mainstream voters to the liberal challenge posed during the 
democratic primaries by jesse jackson according to an analysis of 
primaryseason polls 
abc news pollsters who have been tracking the 1988 race say it 
would be a mistake for the democrats to pop their champagne corks 
since voters know little about the massachusetts governor and their 
opinions are still loosely held in fact voters say they also know 
little about bush 
four in 10 of those surveyed last month could not locate 
democrat dukakis or republican bush on the ideological spectrum 
everything about this race would suggest a close one despite 
dukakis current lead because his support is soft said jeff 
alderman director of the networks polling unit he notes the 
percentage who say they dont know enough about dukakis is nearly 
twice that of bush 
jackson has helped rather than hurt dukakis by unwittingly 
acting as a lightning rod for all of the liberal bogey men the gop 
customarily uses to scare the electorate about the democrats 
said john brennan of abc 
jackson beat dukakis among all liberal primary voters but his 
outspoken brand of liberalism made dukakis look all the more 
moderate the massachusetts governor won overwhelmingly among 
moderates and conservatives abc found 
abcs poll from may 1925 gave dukakis 53 percent support from 
registered voters to bushs 40 percent the margin of error for the 
surveys 1172 registered voters was plus or minus 35 percentage 
points 
the irancontra affair continues to dog bush with a majority of 
the public still doubting that he is telling the truth in the 
scandal abc said the legal problems of attorney general edwin 
meese iii and other administration woes are also taking their toll 
abc found and many americans seem ready for a change 
what is most puzzling to the pollsters however is the publics 
negative perception of the economy which could spell problems for 
bush in november about 42 percent see the economy on a downward 
trend even though it has been performing better than anticipated 
after last falls stock market collapse 
theres a direct correlation between who youre going to vote 
for and your view of the economy says alderman the 
administration seems to have done everything it possibly could to 
goose the economy along but we do not have a majority saying 
the economy is in good shape 
abc says bush won his primary race by taking advantage of a 
strong organization in the weeks before the multistate super 
tuesday primaries 
sen bob dole of kansas matched bush in fame and money and 
enjoyed a burst of momentum from his openingday victory in iowa 
but says abc polling analyst kelly hanley bush benefited from the 
fact that republicans still had positive feelings about ronald 
reagan 
huge majorities of voters wanted to stick with the course 
reagan had set and those people voted for bush hanley said 
on the democratic side dukakis outpaced his rivals with a 
clever strategy of conceding some losses in the south while 
concentrating on the more cosmopolitan southern states including 
delegraterich texas and florida he steamrolled through his 
northeastern home turf weathered defeats in illinois and michigan 
and rebounded to clinch the nomination 
abc polls showed that dukakis drew strength from hispanics jews 
and whites in general and while opponents criticized his lack of 
foreign policy experience abc polls showed that primary voters 
cared little about the issue 
dukakis now appears to be running strongly among jacksons black 
constituents while jackson captured 90 percent of the black 
primary vote registered blacks chose dukakis over bush by 80 
percent to 12 percent in abcs may poll only 6 percent said they 
wouldnt vote if dukakis were the nominee 
in the may survey dukakis outpolled bush on personal qualities 
like whether he cares about people is honest gets things 
done has a vision for the future can be trusted in a crisis and 
is an able leader but bush was perceived as more experienced 
the massachusetts governor was seen as more able to help the 
disenfranchised keep the united states out of a war and reduce the 
deficit bush was perceived as better at keeping a strong national 
defense 
sixtyfour percent of americans had a favorable impression of 
dukakis compared with 50 percent for bush only 11 percent had an 
unfavorable impression of dukakis compared with 35 percent for 
bush 
dukakis may be getting his biggest boost from disaffection wih 
the reagan administration in general and bush in specific said 
brennan 
bush is having trouble assembling the same coalition of 
conservatives and disaffected democrats who twice gave reagan big 
victories abc found 
he is holding on to his core republican supporters but they 
make up only a quarter of the likely electorate he is losing the 
independent vote and is weak among the democrats who defected to 
reagan in 1984 
surprisingly a third of those identifying themselves as 
conservatives said they support dukakis as do 43 percent of white 
bornagain christians dukakis gets twothirds of the registered 
women voters a fact that alone explains his lead in the horserace 
all this does not necessarily preordain a dukakis victory says 
alderman who believes that dukakis high may favorable rating is a 
peak 
until the final couple of weeks the public doesnt focus on 
the race that intensely he says so theres plenty of room for 
change

rescue workers aided by search dogs fanned 
out over this rainsoaked village today trying to unearth about 
100 people buried by a landslide officials said there was little 
chance of finding survivors 
i am nearly sure that no one will come out alive said 
wolfgang krctschemer head of a 32member west german volunteer 
team from the rescue dog association 
theres very little space for air pockets here between the 
soft earth and the rocks where someone trapped could breathe but 
we have to go on looking added klaus kolter another member of 
the german team 
rescue efforts resumed at sunrise today the search had been 
called off during the night after geologists and engineers spotted 
cracks in the mountain that could trigger another devastating slide 
krctschemer said the rescue workers had located the spot where 
the landslide had buried a coffeehouse crowded with breakfasttime 
customers on thursday 
he said they were trying to reach the coffeehouse by digging 
holes from two sides he said rescuers should be able to unearth 
some bodies from the site later in the day 
villagers said about 30 travelers were in the restaurant at the 
time of the disaster and dozens more were at the roadside waiting 
for bulldozers to clear the highway after an earlier rockfall 
three west german tourists and 41 turks were listed as missing 
there were also unconfirmed reports by witnesses that two british 
tourists had been in the coffeehouse but it could not be 
determined whether they had been buried in the landslide or had 
left before the disaster 
trabzon gov enver hizlan said there probably would be delay in 
listing other names because the people involved were in transit 
rescue efforts were hindered by new slides that swept clouds of 
dust into the air and sent giant boulders hurtling down the wooded 
mountainside a turkish truck driver and a villager were injured in 
separate rockfalls on friday 
another landslide hit an area about three miles away from catak 
today closing the main highway no injuries were reported 
grieving relatives watched the rescue works occasionally 
kneeling over a hole and looking down with empty eyes 
do you think anyone can come out alive from there asked 
necati himtas whose 20yearold son was missing 
a woman wailing and weeping was taken to the mobile hospital 
when she fainted 
catak home to 1000 people is situated 19 miles from the black 
sea port of trabzon on a main highway leading to eastern anatolia 
and iran 
the twolane highway was widened three years ago to handle 
increasing truck and tourist traffic but vilagers said it was not 
buttressed properly 
the retaining walls werent big enough and we started having 
landslides not big ones but enough to block the road said riza 
yavuz the village headman 
yavuz said the coffeehouse owner had told public works officials 
earlier this month that the hillside needed more support or it 
would collapse 
erkan omarbeyoglou turkeys director of highways warned that 
new cracks had appeared on the same stretch of mountainside 
suggesting another section could be dislodged 
theres a risk that an entire hilltop could come crashing down 
in the same area omarbeyoglou said he said rescue workers would 
have enough warning to evacuate the area 
the landslide thursday also destroyed a restaurant 20 homes and 
a high school closed for summer vacation a stream burst its banks 
and flooded another part of the village including several houses 
i saw a telegraph pole slowly bending over said gaby 
engler a 28yearold west german nurse who witnessed the slide 
i heard a noise like an explosion and the whole hillside came 
away in front of me

restaurant today spotted a bomb and led scores of patrons to safety 
moments before the device exploded police said 
the explosion occurred shortly after midnight at the papagallo 
restaurant on east londons seaside esplanade 
the bomb a sovietmade limpet mine was discovered by a 
waitress who alerted the manager police said police arrived 
evacuated about 90 diners and were in the process of evacuating

minutes after it had been seen 
it was a close shave said maj trevor hayes a police

the interior of the restaurant was extensively damaged no 
injuries or arrests were reported 
there have been more than 20 bombings in south africa this year 
and police have blamed the outlawed african national congress

system of apartheid which does not permit the 26 million black 
majority to vote and racially segregates schools districts and

leaders at the toronto summit congratulated 
themselves on forging an economy able to withstand last years 
stock market crash but economists agree they did little that could 
prevent future instability 
i think they announced in advance that they werent going to 
accomplish anything and therefore they fulfilled all 
expectations said robert kleimann an expert on economic summits 
with the center for strategic and international studies 
it was a summit of little consequence in terms of the overall 
debt and budget problems that we face said jeff bergner a 
fellow with the hudson institute a moderatetoconservative think 
tank based in indianapolis 
president reagan and other leaders at the sevennation summit 
painted a somewhat rosier picture 
i know many people question the summit process reagan told 
the business table of chief executive officers wednesday night 
after his return from his 14th and last economic summit meeting 
what do the summits do are they just so much sound and fury 
well not on your life he answered himself today all 
year round the summit countries are working more closely together 
than ever before and the summits are a key reason why one payoff 
is that last october when the world markets began to shake the 
international economy stayed steady working together we guided 
the world ship through the storm 
in their final communique the leaders of the united states 
canada britain west germany france italy and japan said that 
since last years meeting in venice our economies have kept up 
the momentum of growth and were still expanding 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said that the very 
clear message that goes out from toronto is one of confidence 
coupled with a commitment to build on and reinforce our success 
even the chairman of reagans own council of economic advisers 
beryl sprinkel however gave only a modest assessment of the 
summit gains in a postsummit interview 
asked if the summiteers had made any concrete progress toward 
their objectives sprinkel said if this were the only summit 
that were ever held or ever had been held id say yes a lot 
but it builds incrementally on prior summits 
we are not at the end of the process sprinkel added 
there is a lot more to be done 
for instance he said marginal tax rate cuts being proposed by 
west germany seemed very small to me 
as for the united states he said we are happy that the 
budget deficit seems to be on a downward trend and the trade 
deficit is coming down but you dont want to look only at trends 
you need to check levels and they are still unsatisfactorily 
high 
robert z lawrence senior fellow in economic studies with the 
liberal brookings institution said no attention has really been 
focused on the financial markets and little on the potential 
sources of underlying instability which basically are related to 
the us budget deficit and since they kind of all took it as 
given that the president wasnt going to do anything on that one 
they really couldnt get an american commitment on that one it 
wasnt worth talking about 
it doesnt mean to say they wont be back about that 
question he said when they meet again in france with a new us 
president in office in 1989

a federal judge who refused to order usair 
flight attendants to halt an apparent overtime boycott says he may 
change his mind should the boycott continue 
us district judge william l standish on friday said he found 
no clear proof that the association of flight attendants encouraged 
the boycott which stranded 11000 passengers during the memorial 
day weekend he denied the airlines request for a preliminary 
injunction for lack of firm evidence against the union 
still standish said he has a strong suspicion of union 
involvement if the job action continues he said he would grant a 
request for an immediate hearing to reconsider his decision 
the airline said it lost an estimated 11 million as a result 
of having to cancel 179 flights because of inadequate staffing 
during the threeday holiday 
we are pleased that the court put the association of flight 
attendants on notice said airline spokesman david shipley as 
a result we expect no future scheduled disruptions 
under their union contract flight attendants can be ordered to 
fly only 85 hours per month attendants can turn down assignments 
after they have reached 85 hours in a month usair relies on 
attendants to volunteer for overtime to keep planes in the air on 
the waning days of each month 
dee maki chief union representative for the pittsburghbased 
flight attendants group said she has no idea if the protest 
will end 
but she said only some of the attendants who refused to work 
during the memorial day holiday were protesting stalled labor 
negotiations many simply wanted the holiday off she said 
ms maki said flight attendants were elated at the judges 
decision they cant believe usair filed the lawsuit she said 
she noted that the independence day holiday weekend occurs at 
the beginning of the month so flight attendants will not be working 
on overtime and therefore cannot turn down assignments 
usair brought the suit last week amid stalled contract 
negotiations with the 1000 flight attendants of pacific southwest 
airlines which merged with usair in april 
federal law forbids airline workers to launch job actions or 
strikes before mediation and arbitration procedures are exhausted

protesters hurled stones at west berlin police 
early today during a clash over a disputed piece of land near the 
berlin wall authorities said police used tear gas and water 
canons to break up the demonstration 
police said one officer was injured when he was struck in the 
head by a rock

adjacent to the berlin wall has been the scene of frequent 
skirmishes between police and environmental activists who occupied 
the area on may 26 to protest plans for construction of a road 
through the area 
the activists are against the road project because it would go 
through a wooded area 
the property which 150 protesters continue to occupy currently 
belongs to east berlin but will be turned over to west berlin in 
july 
west berlin police who cannot legally enter the property have 
fenced it in to keep more protesters from entering the activists 
tried to tear down the barrier but police drove them back 
police said todays clash began after protesters attacked 
officers with stones bottles molotov cocktails and flares 
east german border troops observed the incident from nearby 
guard towers along the heavilyfortified wall that divides the

henry e hudson the us attorney overseeing 
the pentagon fraud probe made his name fighting pornography not 
corruption he is known as an aggressive sort of guy who isnt 
averse to publicity 
at 41 hudson is looking at perhaps his biggest case the 
investigation into allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants bribed pentagon officials for information to help win 
billions of dollars in contracts 
he prides himself on quality prosecutions and being firm and 
fair others say he is a dogged prosecutor almost moralistic in 
his zeal 
hudson is the top federal attorney in northern virginia where 
the pentagon is located and where many of the consultants and 
contractors being investigated have offices 
although there is a special unit in the justice department that 
tracks down fraud it appears that the case went to hudson because 
it was too massive for the justice unit to handle also the units 
offices were located in northern virginia within hudsons 
jurisdiction 
just across the potomac river from the capitol the district 
traditionally has been a highprofile one for a us attorney 
prosecuting federal cases hudson and his assistant joe aronica 
will argue the cases for the government if any charges come to 
trial 
theres a certain amount of prestige that comes with the turf 
but henry is an aggressive sort of guy said robert f horan the 
state attorney for fairfax county in northern virginia in an 
interview with the fairfax journal 
hudson took over the federal prosecutors job in 1986 and 
pledged to improve the offices reputed organization problems and 
to put a greater emphasis on cases of national significance 
as a virginia state prosecutor hed earned the reputation of a 
policemans prosecutor with his crackdowns on massage parlors 
and adult bookstores and his efforts to reduce plea bargains and 
increase jail sentences 
hudson entered the national spotlight two years ago when 
attorney general edwin meese iii made him chairman of his 
pornography commission 
the panel drew derision from civil liberties groups as well as 
rave reviews from antipornography crusaders with its 1986 report 
that asserted that sex crimes can be linked to hardcore 
pornography the panels stance represented an aboutface from the 
conclusion of another government commission in 1970 that there was 
no evidence of harm from pornography 
among other things hudsons panel recommended that congress 
force pornography traffickers to forfeit their profits and that 
video pornography producers be prosecuted for prostitution a 
second conviction under obscenity laws would become a felony 
guaranteeing at least a year behind bars 
hudson argued at the time that the panel should have taken even 
more drastic steps 
i would have preferred that our condemnation of materials 
directly affecting behavior be couched in more forceful language 
and that our recommendations for enhanced law enforcement 
particularly with respect to violent and degrading materials be 
likewise more pronounced hudson wrote 
the american civil liberties union lambasted the panel as 
biased unfair and its arguments intellectually indefensible 
it accused hudson of advocating extreme measures while paying 
little attention to privacy and first amendment rights 
one member of the panel ellen levine said in an interview this 
past week that even though she strongly disagreed with some of 
hudsons opinions she thinks hell do as as good a job as he can 
possibly do with the pentagon probe 
he has a very dogged personality and a very strong sense of 
right and wrong said ms levine editor in chief of womans day 
magazine 
she said that she did not put much stock in reports that the 
attorney was a man who loved being in the headlines he was a 
very moral man if not moralistic and hell do his duty ms 
levine said

the iraqi army said today it recaptured the 
majnoon islands in another offensive against iranian positions 
inside iraq iran reported heavy fighting in the area 
a war communique read over baghdad radio said the series of 
islands located in the hawayza marshes near the iranian border was 
completely liberated at noon 4 am edt 
the report said the elite presidential guards took the islands 
while troops from the 3rd army corps pushed forward to crush the 
enemy and its defenses and guns on lands opposite the islands 
iran has occupied the area located northeast of basra and about 
270 miles southeast of the capital of baghdad since 1984 
the area lies near the border with iran and it was unclear 
whether iraqi forces had pushed into iranian territory iraq in 
seeking a ceasefire in the war has said its troops would not 
enter iran 
our forces started their advance at 345 am toward majnoon 
island and its surroundings the official iraqi news agency said 
earlier quoting a communique from the general command of the iraqi 
armed forces 
the resistance of the enemy deteriorated and collapsed due to 
the iraqi heavy fire added the iraqi report 
irans islamic republic news agency accused iraq of using 
chemical weapons in the attack and said heavy fighting was going on 
in the swampland 
the irna report also monitored in nicosia said substantial 
losses and damage have been inflicted on the iraqi forces and a 
number of them have been captured heavy fighting reportedlly 
continues in the region 
the ina dispatch called the operation codenamed trust in 
god the second phase of the iraqi push to liberate areas 
occupied by iran along the southern border east of basra 
the dispatch compared the battle to the april 16 assault on the 
faw peninsula which ended two years of iranian occupation in that 
area 
the nearly 8yearold war had reached a stalemate before the 
iraqis seized the initiative with their lightening assault on faw 
the iraqis sudden switch from years of static warfare from 
behind their formidable defense lines to aggressive attacking 
techniques caught the iranians off guard 
in may the iraqis struck again driving the iranians out of the 
bridgehead around salamchah also east of basra in a 10hour 
battle 
the latest battle was an assault on mehran last week by the 
national liberation army of iran a group of iranian rebels backed 
by the government of iraqi president saddam hussein 
iran claimed the capture of the border city was the work of 
regular iraqi troops but both iraq and the iranian insurgents 
denied the claim the rebel army following its usual pattern of 
inflicting as much damage on the forces of the ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini and then withdrawing said its forces pulled back across 
the iraqi border on wednesday 
the attack on mehran 90 miles east of baghdad might have been 
a diversion to draw iranian forces away from the southern front 
around majnoon island in preparation for the new iraqi assault 
according to a perisan gulf war analyst who spoke on condition of 
anonymity

the nations capital had plenty of 
attentiongrabbers last week a juicy pentagon scandal ronald 
reagans last summit a new 16 million house of representatives 
phone system that went deaf but heres what washington was really 
talking about 
a fugitive ferret named fuji its combative owner and a 
5yearold boy 
not even carl rowans uninvited underwear swimmer the 
18yearold suburban lad shot after taking an unauthorized dip in 
the columnists pool could match the continuing drama 
the ferrets owner 19yearold jennifer au was on a weekend 
furlough from jail where she spent the week charged with contempt 
of court for not telling where fuji is the boy auston jacob 
simpson was nearing the end of a painful series of six rabies 
shots 
the story began june 3 when austons grandmother took him to the 
docktor pet center in manassas va a washington suburb he 
stopped by a cage containing fuji and two other ferrets one bit 
him authorities then sought to kill each of the ferrets and test 
their innards for rabies 
two of the ferrets were sacrificed their heads cut off and 
their brains examined by health officials who found the animals to 
have been healthy but fuji was spirited away by miss au who 
worked in the pet shop 
in court charged with concealing the animal she said she left 
the ferret at an abandoned house after making a deal over the 
telephone with someone she didnt know to have it picked up the 
anonymous phone contact apparently was made after the biting 
incident became known to a group of ferret lovers 
miss au told circuit judge percy thornton that said she saw the 
boy being bitten and that fuji didnt do it moreover she said 
the ferret had been isolated in a cage for more than a month and 
its continued good health proved it didnt have rabies 
she said she had tried to comply with the judges order to 
produce the animal by contacting ferret groups but the judge was 
unsympathetic 
youre putting this child at risk thornton said and found 
her in contempt when she shouted at him the judge ordered her 
jailed for three hours 
i think your priorities are mixed up said thornton 
a weekend went by and the ferret still had not been produced 
thornton ordered miss au to jail if it were in this courts 
power said the judge i would put you through the same thing 
this child is going through 
on thursday with the ferret still missing miss au appeared 
before the judge for a bond hearing and was turned down on friday 
thornton issued the weekend leave and ordered the young woman back 
behind bars on monday 
meanwhile a second person a 24yearold man who was not 
publicly identified was scheduled to begin the rabies shots after 
he said he was bitten by a ferret in the same store 
the ferret battle was fought not only in court but in the pages 
of the washington post 
an editorial sided with the judge and his hard line it is 
truly contemptible that this woman and her confederates have chosen 
to put a child through this torture rather than obey a court order 
and the dictates of common decency said the post 
but in the same issue writer henry mitchell allied himself with 
the ferret 
there has to be some reasonable basis for thinking this 
particular ferret despite testimony to the contrary bit the boy 
and from everything you could read of the case there was no reason 
to doubt the woman when she swore it was not her ferret he wrote 
the ferret story was not the clear winner in the 
talkofthetown competition the rowanintruder story resurfaced 
when authorities decided to charge the uninvited swimmer and the 
young woman arrested with him in rowans back yard but not to 
charge the columnist for shooting the young man 
the onagain offagain phone system in the house was a oneday 
sensation causing impassioned denunciations from congressmen who 
found their link to constituents interrupted and the pentagon 
procurement scandal continued to bubble 
the weeks most telling quote came from miss au when she was 
jailed on monday this is extremely stupid and ridiculous 
needless she said this has gone too far

in the decade since a supreme court decision 
in the allan bakke case ended the use of enrollment quotas the 
number of minority students admitted to medical school actually 
increased in the united states according to the association of 
american medical colleges 
robert g petersdorf president of the association said that in 
1978 it was feared that the bakke decision which forbids the use 
of special consideration in the admission of minorities would 
cause medical schools to enroll even fewer minorities than before 
the opposite proved to be true petersdorf said 
in the first enrollment period after the bakke decision 409 
percent of the minority students who applied to medical schools 
were admitted and minority enrollees composed 87 percent of 
firstyear medical school classes 
ten years later petersdorf said the medical schools are 
admitting 517 percent of the minority applicants and they now 
represent 102 percent of the entering classes 
the supreme court decision actually encouraged affirmative 
action goals by allowing the use of race and other determinants in 
addition to academic achievement as acceptable admissions 
criteria petersdorf said 
he said that medical schools began affirmative action steps in 
1970 and the bakke decision reaffirmed them

federal regulators give new york money centers 
with troubled overseas loans more leeway than texas banks hobbled 
by declines in oil prices and a deflated real estate market sen 
lloyd bentsen a texas democrat and chairman of the senate finance 
committee said saturday 
the result is that domestic borrowers have greater difficulty 
acquiring credit than borrowers like poland bentsen said in a 
letter urging the chiefs of the federal reserve board federal 
deposit insurance corp and the comptroller of the currency to 
review their regulatory practices 
bentsen said recent data indicate banks must set aside greater 
reserves against domestic troubled loans than against troubled 
loans to third world and eastern bloc nations 
this favorable treatment by regulators of troubled foreign 
loans over domestic loans will crimp credit to domestic 
borrowers bentsen wrote federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
fdic chairman l william seidman and robert l clarke comptroller 
of the currency 
this is particularly important to areas like texas whose banks 
hold a disproportionate share of troubled domestic loans wrote 
bentsen as the state attempts to rebuild its economy it needs a 
robust and healthy banking system able to provide needed credit 
to worthy borrowers ranking from small businesses to ranchers and 
farmers 
fdic spokesman alan whitney said he and seidman had not seen the 
letter and could not comment on it but he said regulators were not 
being any more stringent on texas banks than those elsewhere in the 
country 
rates for reserves set aside for foreign loans depend on a 
variety of factors including the country the loan and the bank 
whitney said 
lee cross an aide to clarke said the comptroller shared 
bentsens concerns about the problems in the texas economy and 
texas banks but he wanted to see the figures on which the 
senators letter was based before commenting further 
bentsen said fdic data indicate that an amount comparable to 51 
percent of nonperforming domestic loans is being held as loan loss 
reserves but calculations by the joint economic committee of 
congress suggest that considerably smaller reserves only 24 
percent are being set aside against troubled loans by banks to 
third world and eastern bloc nations he wrote 
i think this is unfair and unequal treatment said bentsen 
i would much rather have a loan collateralized by an empty 
building in texas than to depend on the commitments of a foreign 
communist country like poland 
bentsen said he was drafting legislation to correct that kind 
of slanted treatment favoring the big money banks in new york 
compared to texas banks 
it really hurts not just the banks in texas but the borrowers 
too because we dont have sufficient capital that means for 
small businesses mediumsized businesses bentsen said

investigators in the pentagon bribery probe 
videotaped meetings in which pentagon personnel allegedly took 
payoffs from consultants sources familiar with the twoyear 
investigation said today 
the sources said that two key figures in the probe victor 
cohen deputy assistant secretary of the air force for tactical 
systems and james gaines a deputy assistant secretary of the 
navy appear on some of the videotapes although they declined to 
characterize what those tapes showed 
nbc news reported friday night that cohen would leave the 
pentagon whenever a defense consultant would call that his 
meetings with consultants were recorded and videotaped and that 
money changed hands 
the washington post meanwhile reported that cohen deputy 
assistant secretary of the air force for tactical systems is among 
those cooperating in the investigation 
cohens attorney seymour glanzer declined to comment today 
about any aspect of the probe when asked about the videotapes of 
alleged payoffs to his client and whether his client was 
cooperating with the government 
gaines also was videotaped at meetings with consultants where 
highly confidential documents relating to pentagon contracts 
allegedly changed hands said the sources 
sources close to the case said this week that gaines is 
cooperating in the investigation but other sources and the post 
said today that while gaines gave a statement to investigators 
earlier he is not cooperating with prosecutors at this point 
the consultants shown on the videotapes include melvyn paisley 
a former assistant secretary of the navy whose office was searched 
by federal authorities last week in the investigation 
the secret information could have given the recipients an 
advantage in competing for contracts worth billions of dollars 
between 75 and 100 pentagon contracts may have been tainted 
according to prosecutor henry e hudson 
cohen and gaines have been temporarily reassigned to other 
duties since their offices were searched last week by investigators 
gaines attorney michael schatzow said friday night he had no 
comment on the videotapes but added ill just wait and allow 
everybody whos been reporting these stories to wait and be 
embarrassed later 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella denounced the leaking 
of information on videotaping 
this is just a further example of the government trying their 
case in the press rather than waiting for specific allegations to 
try in court barcella said 
the information on videotapes surfaced as members of congress 
are debating how the government should treat defense contractors 
under scrutiny in a wideranging probe into whether they bought 
information from consultants who got the information from pentagon 
officials they bribed 
the senate appropriations committee considered legislation 
friday that would have given the government the power to withhold 
payments to companies that are under investigation in the pentagon 
probe 
the proposal was withdrawn after a debate in which one side 
argued that no payments should be made on fraudulently obtained 
contracts while the other side insisted that such action would be 
premature 
meanwhile a senator said in a television interview that if 
corruption was detected in a substantial number of contracts they 
should be renegotiated 
and thats a tough tough problem because those contracts are 
producing essential goods to our national defense today sen 
john warner rva said on a syndicated television interview show 
john mclaughlins one on one warner is a former navy secretary 
the amendment considered by the appropriations committee was 
offered by sen ted stevens ralaska he said he was pressing it 
to head off measures by sens ernest hollings dsc and alfonse 
damato rny that would have affected specific contractors 
stevens said his amendment would give the government an option 
short of permanently terminating a contract to halt payments 
temporarily where these practices may have caused the government 
to be not treated fairly 
but other lawmakers argued that the enactment of such a law 
would prematurely interfere with the investigation of the scandal 
and threaten the jobs of workers at defense contracting firms 
youre going to hurt a lot of innocent people said sen 
warren rudman rnh 
stevens withdrew his proposal saying he might introduce it on 
the senate floor later after the other lawmakers agreed not to 
pursue their more specific provisions 
he had introduced the language as an amendment to the 2826 
billion fiscal 1989 department of defense appropriations bill 
which the committee sent to the full senate on a voice vote 
attorney general edwin meese iii asked about the probes 
status said he did not know whether it will expand at all 
adding its at the normal stage of an investigation where 
youre collecting information youre analyzing information and 
then youre determining what the next steps might be 
elsewhere brian c elmer an attorney for united technologies 
corp said he has asked us district judge john h pratt to allow 
the company to examine a government affidavit supporting a search 
warrant that the judge had issued 
the warrant enabled fbi agents to go through the downtown 
washington office of eugene tallia a vice president for washington 
operations of the companys pratt amp whitney engine manufacturing 
unit company lawyers said they wanted to examine the affidavit to 
determine whether the search was proper 
the fbi asserted in the search warrant that pratt amp whitney 
possessed sensitive documents that rival general electric co had 
submitted to the defense department in competing for hundreds of 
millions of dollars in contracts

michael dukakis who so far has seemed 
blessed by that greatest of all political commodities good luck 
is enjoying a brief island retreat after a week in which events 
seemed to be moving against him 
in the span of a few days last week the massachusetts governor 
faced the unpleasant task of raising state taxes and saw two 
potential scandals burst into view back at the boston statehouse 
the democratic presidential nomineetobe came under fresh 
attack from his republican rival and jesse jacksons shifting 
comments provided a potentially divisive distraction as dukakis 
sought to focus on the task of selecting a running mate 
its not a worry dukakis said when asked about the 
potential danger posed by jackson to the ticket i enjoy this 
its one of the great jobs of being a chief executive putting 
a team together 
as dukakis relaxed on this scenic island off cape cod 
republican rival george bush already was seizing on his reluctant 
endorsement of state tax increases and stepping up his criticism of 
the governors program allowing prison inmates out on furlough 
dukakis decision to sign the state legislatures bill imposing 
a 5 percent increase on the tax on cigarettes producing 40 
million in revenues was one of several moves to shore up a state 
budget shortfall 
taxes are always a last resort dukakis said in his defense 
with serious budget problems that already have prompting 
spending cuts dukakis also is supporting another 75 million in 
increases by bringing the massachusetts tax code in line with 
federal tax changes 
bush the certain gop nominee who lags behind dukakis by double 
digits in most polls immediately pointed to dukakis support for 
massachusetts taxes as evidence he harbors a similar inclination as 
a fix for the large federal deficits 
i will not raise your taxes period he just has in his home 
state bush said 
he was voicing a tax cuts versus tax hikes theme democrats 
expect to hear more of as republicans try to appeal to what they 
calculate is a national aversion to deal with the deficit by 
increasing taxes 
dukakis has avoided saying he would support any federal tax 
increase if elected president but he clearly has left the door 
open 
he proposes increased efforts to enforce tax laws including the 
hiring of more federal revenue agents coupled with spending cuts 
and steps to increase revenues by spurring the economy 
if you do all those things and still need additional revenues 
then you have to be willing to go to congress and ask for it 
dukakis said 
if dukakis has seemed fortunate as major or potential rivals 
dropped aside in his quest for the nomination he might not have 
felt that way thursday as he confronted a state deadline on the 
tax question felt bushs barbs and faced questions about 
allegations of misdeeds in his administration 
dukakis and his aides put forward a picture of unconcern over 
the disclosure that the fbi was conducting a preliminary 
investigation into the states planned purchase of land for a 
prison in the rural town of new braintree 
dukakis denied any wrongdoing and administration officials 
questioned whether political motivations lay behind disclosure 
the fbi commenting on a report about the preliminary probe in 
the washington times said dukakis was not the subject of their 
inquiry but added that it was not yet at a stage where anyone was 
a target 
some residents of the town have accused dukakis of cronyism in 
his support for purchasing land there for the prison in a deal that 
would result in a handsome profit for developers who purchased the 
land whether dukakis was acquainted with the developers was a 
matter of dispute one however was a contributor to his 
presidential campaign 
dukakis cited executive privilege in refusing to release two 
documents sought by opponents they are memos between dukakis and 
his legal counsel just before transactions involving the property 
an unrelated embarrassment came when the governors former 
education adviser gerard t indelicato was accused of larceny and 
forgery related to his state duties indelicato previously pleaded 
guilty to separate federal charges of fraud and conspiracy 
the criminal charges against gerard indelicato are very 
serious more so because they allege a violation of the public 
trust dukakis said 
over this series of backyard problems the specter of jacksons 
potentially devisive interest in the vice presidency loomed 
jackson has sent seemingly confusing conflicting signals over 
whether he wants the vice presidency but it seemed certain hed 
like to be asked even though public polls suggest he would be a 
drag on the democratic ticket nationally 
everybody knows in the last analysis the nominee has to make 
that decision and people accept that dukakis said 
including jesse by the way

creation of a west european central 
bank an idea that gained little currency in the past is quietly 
emerging as a longrange priority of the 12nation european 
economic community 
the prospect of establishing a us federal reservestyle 
central bank for western europe is expected to be a major topic of 
discussion at an eec summit conference starting june 27 in hanover 
west germany 
but decisions to take the first concrete steps toward a 
eurobank to manage a common monetary policy are not likely in 
hanover analysts say many other related questions such as 
harmonizing tax policies in the common market probably will have 
to be settled first 
norbert walter senior economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt 
says establishment of a central bank for europe probably is still 
a long way off 
some eec members such as britain dont like the idea they 
think it would force them to surrender too much national control 
prime minister margaret thatcher has not even heeded her eec 
partners urgings to include britain in the european monetary 
system which was created in 1979 to keep european currency values 
stable 
yet talk of a european currency union is becoming more serious 
than just a year ago when the idea which has been discussed off 
and on for more than two decades was generally dismissed as a 
pipe dream 
it is not just utopia it is not nirvana it is something that 
can be accepted in the europe of today walter said in a 
telephone interview 
many european leaders have come to believe that the eecs plan 
for creating a true common market by 1992 one that allows goods 
people and money to freely cross national borders increases the 
need for a european central bank to cope with less rigid capital 
markets 
this feeling has been reinforced by a june 13 agreement by 
european finance ministers to remove national controls on capital 
movements by july 1990 in the eight most advanced eec countries 
the agreement excludes the four countries that have joined the eec 
since 1973 spain ireland greece and portugal 
spain and ireland were given a deadline of 1992 greece and 
portugal have until 1995 
gerhard stoltenberg the west german finance minister hailed 
the accord as a milestone of great importance on the path to 
unifying the european market and increasing the eecs global 
competitiveness 
at the hanover summit west german chancellor helmut kohl is 
expected to propose that a special panel of central bank officials 
and other experts from eec countries be set up to study the central 
bank issue 
this is a topic that is clearly gaining pace said richard 
reid senior european economist at the londonbased investment firm 
philips and drew 
the eventual structure of a european central bank is far from 
clear but one idea is to model it after the us federal reserve 
with regional representatives and independently appointed governors 
kohl is a strong supporter of establishing a true european 
monetary union with a central bank as the linchpin but the 
independent bundesbank or german central bank has been cool to 
the idea 
the vision of a european union is most certainly closely bound 
with that of a european currency union kohl told a recent 
frankfurt conference 
even though one of the original aims of the eec was to create an 
economic and monetary union all the member nations still have 
their own currencies and set their own policies on interest rates 
and money supply 
an embryonic regional currency known as the european currency 
unit or ecu has been in use since 1979 but mainly as an 
accounting device the ecu does not exist as a hard currency in 
bank notes or coins except for a special issue of ecu coins last 
year by belgium to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding 
of the eec 
the ecu is based on an average of common market currencies and 
currently is worth about 120 
a european central bank would in the vision held by many 
supporters of an eec monetary union be the manager of the ecu 
much as the federal reserve manages the dollar by influencing 
interest rate levels and controlling the supply of money in the 
economy 
one of the main questions to be settled is whether a european 
monetary authority could coexist with national central banks or 
whether it would replace them 
if this and other complex issues are resolved european economic 
integration will have advanced much further than even the most 
ardent european unionists would have believed possible in the early 
1980s

with no end in sight to the 4monthold writers 
strike thousands of workers who depend on movie and tv production 
for a living face a summer of dwindling savings accounts and 
mounting bills 
from sunset strip restaurants to dry cleaners in the san 
fernando valley the hollywood community and the businesses that 
profit from it are withering on the vine at a time when activity 
should be at its peak in preparation for the fall harvest of new 
television shows and oscarcontending movies 
i hope this strike ends soon said laura gomez of the 
familyowned la boutique dry cleaners in suburban sherman oaks 
home to many film and tv performers and workers they were coming 
in with their silk shirts and wool gabardine suits now they come 
in with their tshirts and levis 
members of the writers guild of america voted wednesday to 
continue their walkout rejecting by a 3to1 margin a final 
offer from the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers 
the writers went on strike march 7 over the issues of payments 
for reruns of onehour shows and programs broadcast in foreign 
markets as well as creative control 
virtually all programming for the fall season has been idled 
the exceptions are some independently produced shows that have 
signed their own guild contracts including the cosby show and

i wont as long as i can hold out and my bank will stay with me

a restaurant owner whose business is off 30 
percent quit making doughnuts because nobody buys them the same 
news about dried up business is repeated at the liquor store tire 
shop grocery and appliance store 
the worst drought in 50 years is a double whammy for tunica 
county one of the poorest counties in the nation farmers who grow 
cotton soybeans and wheat in the upper mississippi delta are 
afraid their crops will burn up and a lake that used to lure 
tourist dollars is so low that few fishermen and boaters bother to 
go out 
boy it hurts theres not a business in town thats not 
affected said jim fowler sitting behind the counter of the 
customerless brown bag liquors its a real bad situation all the 
way around 
tunica county is 64 percent farmland it ranks 78th among 
mississippis 82 counties in per capita income with a yearly 
average of 6800 according to the state economists office other 
than the recreation business from the lake it has no industry the 
population is 9652 down from 16826 in 1960 
cotton is still king here accounting for 40 percent of the crop 
value but there also are long straight rows of soybeans wheat 
rice and other crops in flat fields of sandy loam and buckshot 
black clay 
theyre all struggling to grow there hasnt been a decent rain 
since april 
it hasnt got to the point where were going to abandon the 
crop and throw the towel in but were hurting said county 
agriculture agent dwayne wheeler 
the drought affects everybody when the farmers not spending 
money theres not a whole lot of money being spent wheeler said 
its killing my business said wiley chambers owner of the 
blue and white restaurant where the glazed cake doughnuts are a 
thing of the past these farmers wont spend any money when it 
looks bad and it looks bad 
jim sturgill owner of delta tire and alignment had nary a car 
or tractor in his garage 
look in the shop theres nothing we havent done any 
business sturgill said 
on a 100plus degree day the pavement seems to melt in the 
distance under a blistering sun and dogs nap in what shade they 
can find tractors pulling discs kick up clouds of dust that hang 
in the air and assault the throat 
owen bibb 55 has 4000 acres of land some of which hasnt 
been planted while he waits for rain on friday he laid off 15 
farmhands 
were scared of what may be facing us bibb said were in 
no position to stand a sorry crop we cant survive a complete 
bust all we can do is put our faith in the good lord worrying 
dont help 
if its too dry to plow the fish surely arent biting at the 
tunica cutoff the 20milelong lake was once part of the 
mississippi river which made a meandering loop 
in 1942 the us army corps of engineers eliminated the loop by 
plowing a new channel leaving a lake fed by the river with the 
river at its lowest level since records were first kept in 1872 
the lake is emptying 
the county is losing an estimated 20000 each week on gas 
groceries bait hardware and other goods the fishermen arent 
buying according to the tunica cutoff lake development 
association the estimate is based on a corps of engineers study 
last year on the lakes economic benefits 
its pitiful its killing us said tait selden 33 owner 
of one of four fishing camps on the lake 
fishermen normally come from arkansas missouri tennessee and 
ohio for the lakes bounty of bass brim sauger crappie and 
catfish but selden said his business is off 80 percent parking 
lots that hold 200 cars on a good weekend are barren 
if this lake wasnt here this town would have dried up and 
blown away a long time ago selden said 
selden and his associates want the government to build a dam to 
keep the lake at an acceptable level 
for now theres nothing but shrinking businesses that match the 
shrinking lake marvin daughtry who raises bugs for bait says his 
business is off 40 percent overall and 70 percent on the lake 
it absolutely scares me to death the future implications of 
this said the owner of daughtrys cricket ranch nobody knows 
how deep this is going to go

a judges decision to throw out a 24 million 
lawsuit that mixed the cia contras and the medellin cocaine cartel 
has left lingering questions charges of politics big bills and 
little doubt that litigation will continue 
chief us district judge james lawrence king ruled thursday 
that the two journalists who filed the suit failed to prove their 
allegations that the 29 defendants conspired in a gunsfordrugs 
scheme or a 1984 terrorist bombing in nicaragua 
the defendants included irancontra figures richard secord and 
albert hakim contra leader adolfo calero former cia deputy 
director of operations theodore shackley and retired major general 
and anticommunist crusader john k singlaub 
the suit was filed in may 1986 six months before the 
irancontra affair became public many of the people it brought to 
light such as secord hakim calero and singlaub have been 
indicted or forced to appear before congressional committees 
investigating that case 
the suit involved heroin smuggling from laos the phoenix 
assassination program in vietnam the bay of pigs fiasco cocaine 
smuggling from colombia illegal contra arms running bombings 
threats disappearances all to push what the plaintiffs believed 
was a rabid rightwing ideology 
on the side of the journalists tony avirgan and martha honey 
was the liberal washingtonbased christic institute and their 
attorney daniel sheehan a veteran of suits on behalf of radiation 
victim karen silkwood and against the ku klux klan 
both sides say politics was at the root of the case which was 
to go to trial monday 
i think it was 100 percent political says singlaub i 
think their real agenda is to discredit the intelligence service 
discredit the reagan administration in general and to discredit 
george bush 
the vice president led the cia at the time shackley was 
allegedly involved in the conspiracy and later while vice 
president the christics said his office was aware of arms 
smuggling to the contras 
the christic institute explanation is a mirror image of 
singlaubs they say the politics involved was not theirs but 
rather that of the judge who favored the defendants and people in 
the government who pressured him to protect bush 
i believe what has happened here is that this ruling is not a 
legal ruling its a political ruling said sara nelson director 
of the institute the judge didnt want a political drama in his 
courtroom before the election 
both sides agree more litigation is in the wings 
i have under active consideration plans to sue sheehan for 
libel said secord this suit has been from the beginning 
preposterous everyone thinks its absurd and defaming and 
malicious 
sheehan is taking kings decision to an appeals court but says 
he would be delighted to be the center of a libel trial wed be 
right back in court with all our witnesses and all our documents 
he said 
one reason the defendants are threatening countersuits is to 
recover the ruinously expensive costs of attending hearings 
responding to voluminous motions reading thousands of documents 
and taking depositions from hundreds of witnesses the witness list 
submitted for the trial had more than 2000 names 
singlaub said he spent more than 250000 on his own defense 
and his attorney thomas spencer said the defendants collectively 
spent 1 million 
it cost the christic institute even more 3 million according 
ms nelson 
according to the suit shackley and others using drug profits 
assassinated officials first in vietnam then iran nicaragua and 
other nations 
the key event in the suit was the may 1984 bombing of a news 
conference held by contra commander eden pastora in la penca 
nicaragua 
three journalists and five pastora supporters died in the 
explosion avirgan was hurt and his camera damaged in the 
explosion allowing him to file a civil damage suit under federal 
law 
the suit charged the bombing was arranged by shackley contra 
leaders and others angered that pastora refused to join 
antisandinista groups he considered too close to the cia and 
deposed nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza debayle

the reagan administrations top economist 
predicts robust growth and low inflation will enhance george bushs 
campaign for the white house but some private analysts say the 
outlook isnt all that rosy 
conventional wisdom says most people vote their pocketbooks and 
according to beryl sprinkel chairman of president reagans council 
of economic advisers prospects for continued prosperity have 
seldom been better 
the administration is looking for the sixth straight year of 
economic expansion coupled with low inflation to bolster 
republican chances at the polls this november 
sprinkel who was criticized as too optimistic late last year 
when he predicted strong steady growth for 1988 issued new 
projections in the past week that look even better 
he boosted his prediction of overall economic growth as measured 
by the gross national product from 29 percent the same as 1986 
and 1987 to 35 percent 
he cut his unemployment rate forecast from 58 percent to 55 
percent and stuck to his estimate of consumer price inflation 43 
percent the same as last year 
this expansion already in its precedentbreaking 67th month 
now gives every indication of continuing at least through the end 
of this administration and on into next year he said 
private economists who six months ago accused sprinkel of 
looking at the world through rosecolored glasses now concede that 
his growth projections then were if anything too conservative 
the lasting shock to consumer buying that economists thought 
would come from the october stock market crash never really 
materialized and some say even the administrations new and higher 
growth estimate is on target even as they are more concerned about 
the inflation outlook 
the commerce departments latest report on gnp said booming 
exports and a sharp increase in modernization and expansion 
spending by businesses pushed growth to 36 percent in the first 
quarter of this year after even stronger growth of 48 percent in 
the last quarter of 1987 
private analysts however part company with sprinkels 
prediction that inflation will hold steady at about the same level 
as last year 
michael k evans head of an economic consulting firm in 
washington called the inflation numbers pie in the sky stuff 
donald h straszheim chief economist of merrill lynch said the 
economy has really done better than anybody has a right to 
expect in making the transition from consumerled to 
exportdriven growth 
but he said the administration cant ignore the inflationary 
effect of the drought scorching the nations midsection coming 
increases in the price of food which accounts for onefifth of all 
consumer purchases likely will boost inflation to at least 5 
percent he said 
sprinkel agreed the severity of the rise in food prices remains 
uncertain but said he has allowed for temporary increases he said 
that packaging and distribution account for far more of the retail 
price of food than crop prices and argued food prices were 
unlikely to add significantly to the underlying inflation rate 
because food represents only about 2 percent of gnp 
however david jones chief economist of aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer said a stiff jolt to food 
prices runs the risk of triggering inflation psychology that 
spills over into other sectors of the economy just as the run up 
in oil prices did in the 1970s 
the shading of the administrations estimates on inflation may 
involve at least some electionyear politics in addition to 
economic analysis jones said what the administration is 
trying to do is present a picture of strong economic growth and low 
inflation as we come into an election

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address as delivered saturday from the white house 
my fellow americans this past week i traveled to canada for my 
eighth economic summit with leaders of the industrialized 
democracies the summit produced important results 
we agreed on a plan to provide debt relief for some of the 
poorest countries of the world we moved important agricultural 
reform negotiations forward and we rededicated our nations to 
combatting the modernday evils of airplane hijackings terrorism 
and illegal drugs 
its this last matter the fight against illegal drugs that 
id like to take a moment to discuss with you this afternoon 
this past weeks meeting in canada wasnt the first time the 
drug problem had been discussed among my summit colleagues at the 
1985 summit in bonn we established an expert group to identify 
areas for enhancing the effectiveness and cooperation in fighting 
the scourge of illegal drugs the expert group presented its report 
at our 1986 summit in tokyo and the report proved useful in 
setting our countries on a path of cooperation in combatting drug 
abuse and illicit drugtrafficking 
now the summit leaders have supported an initiative for a 
special group launched by vice president bush and canadian prime 
minister mulroney that would extend and promote the work done by 
the bonn summit this group will propose methods to improve 
international cooperation in combatting production trafficking 
and financing of the drug trade 
im hopeful this group can identify measures for a major 
coordinated assault on drugs but today the battle against drugs 
extends far beyond the seven industrialized democracies represented 
in toronto just one year ago 138 nations members of the united 
nations met in vienna to participate in the historic 
international conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking 
this conference proved a resounding success in bringing together 
representatives from around the globe 
each of the participating governments declared its commitment to 
vigorous action against drug abuse and illicit drugtrafficking 
perhaps even more important the 138 nations adopted a 
comprehensive outline of activities all nations can undertake to 
fight illegal drugs these activities include the reduction of 
demand for illegal drugs the suppression of illicit drug 
production and trafficking and the treatment and rehabilitation of 
drugdependent people 
one suggestion coming out of the un conference was the 
recommendation for a commemorative day an international day 
against drug abuse and illicit trafficking the un general assembly 
then set aside june 26th to serve as this day of observance around 
the world nations will join the united nations commemorating the 
international fight against drugs and im pleased that the united 
states will be among them 
attorney general meese who headed our delegation to the 
conference in vienna will host a ceremony to draw attention to the 
international day and to reaffirm the commitment of the united 
states to a drugfree america and yes a drugfree world here at 
home this past week the white house conference for a drugfree 
america released its report 
this document included more than 100 recommendations for 
combatting drugabuse and illicit drugtrafficking well be giving 
these recommendations careful consideration in the days ahead and 
theres another important antidrug effort underway here at home 
it was on may 18th that i called on to use my own words both 
houses of the congress both sides of the aisle to join with my 
representatives in a special executive legislative task force to 
advance americas unified response to the problem of illegal drug 
use end quote my goal is to combine the expertise of the 
executive and legislative branches to identify the next steps we 
should take to stop the illegal use distribution and production 
of drugs and to begin taking these steps on a bipartisan basis 
im sure youll agree the drug problem is a national problem 
that demands national solutions and is too important for us to 
permit partisan bickering i was pleased that the house and senate 
minority leaders bob dole and bob michel appointed their 
representatives to the task force and i urge the speaker of the 
house and the majority leader of the senate to appoint their own 
representatives quickly so we can get to work 
next week my national drug policy board will recommend specific 
proposals that would be important to any new drug legislation 
today illegal drug use is down in our high schools cocaine and 
heroin seizures are up and perhaps most important attitudes about 
illegal drugs have changed but were working on working to make 
our beloved land what we know it ought to be and can be a truly 
drugfree america 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

a us marine corps helicopter slammed into a 
hillside and burned saturday while flying in fog near a nuclear 
power plant and all seven marines on board were killed officials 
said 
the sikorsky ch53d sea stallion crashed about 30 minutes after 
leaving the us marine corps air station at iwakuni in 
southwestern japan said sgt nolan wells of the stations public 
affairs office 
names of the victims were withheld pending notification of their 
families 
cloudy skies and dense fog were reported in the area at the time 
of the crash on the southwest tip of shikoko island but it wasnt 
immediately known if the weather contributed to the accident 
since 1980 at least 88 people have died in accidents involving 
the sea stallion or the latermodel super stallion the largest 
and most expensive helicopter used by the us military 
television footage showed japanese and american rescue workers 
carrying bodies in sacks over terraced rice paddies less than two 
miles from a nuclear power station 
fog swirled around the hill where the aircraft crashed and 
burned and it appeared to be raining lightly the wreckage was 
scattered over a wide area according to a local police official 
who identified himself only as sakamoto 
japanese aviation law prohibits aircraft from flying over 
nuclear power stations and other nuclearrelated facilities there 
are about 30 such facilities in japan 
the law also says that aircraft which must fly over such 
facilities due to bad weather or to avoid a collision must take 
the least hazardous course or altitude 
a japanese defense agency official said in a telephone interview 
that he saw little problem with the helicopters flight path 
we noticed the copter took a course several kilometers away 
from the plant despite the poor visibility in the area at the 
time of the accident said the official who refused to be named 
the marines were flying to their base at camp futenma in 
okinawa 580 miles away where they were assigned to marine heavy 
helicopter squadron 402 of the 1st marine air wing wells said the 
united states has about 20000 marines stationed in okinawa 
the sea stallion left iwakuni about 700 miles southwest of 
tokyo at 950 am and crashed at about 1020 am wells said 
the ch53d is capable of carrying up to 55 troops or a cargo of 
32000 pounds the singlerotor twinengine aircraft is made by 
the stratford connbased sikorsky aircraft division of the united 
technologies corp 
the helicopter has had a series of operational problems and 
fatal crashes 
in november 1985 the military grounded the helicopters after 
mechanics in a routine inspection discovered a defect in the 
locknut that helps hold the rotor blade assembly to the aircraft 
sikorskys former chief safety engineer alleged in a march 1987 
court affidavit that metal mounts on the tail rotor gearbox of the 
helicopter have failed or been suspected of failing an estimated 60 
times since 1968 sikorsky attorneys said the man was a disgruntled 
former employee who was using internal company documents in 
violation of his contract 
three marines died in a feb 13 1987 accident involving a sea 
stallion helicopter in the trabuco canyon area near el toro calif 
in july 1985 a ch53d crashed off japan killing four marines 
in may 1985 17 marines were presumed killed when their sea 
stallion crashed into the ocean off japans southern coast and in 
march 1984 a sea stallion slammed into a mountainside in seoul 
and all 18 americans and 11 south koreans were killed in 1983 
seven people died in two accidents 
in addition five were killed in 1982 in one crash nine in 1981 
in four accidents and seven in 1980 in four accidents

here is the text of the democratic partys 
weekly radio address as delivered saturday by rep barbara boxer 
of california 
this is congresswoman barbara boxer from california id like to 
talk to you about the pentagon scandal and why congress is deeply 
troubled by it 
youve heard about scandals before but this one is different 
it strikes at the heart of our national security and i 
believe was fueled by a consistent message by the reagan 
administration that government is our enemy and big defense 
business our friend 
if the fbi is right then secret information worth tens of 
billions has been traded by military insiders and defense 
contractors to line their pockets and undermine the competitive 
system that congress has mandated 
why has this happened i dont agree with president reagan that 
its understandable do you 
or with defense secretary carlucci who says theres nothing 
wrong with the system its just a few individuals 
where is the outrage where is the concern 
the root cause of this scandal was alluded to more than 20 years 
ago by a president from the military dwight eisenhower he warned 
about the unwarranted influence of the militaryindustrial complex 
and the need for an alert citizenry to protect against it 
i want you to be an alert citizenry i want you to know what has 
gone on since this administration came to power in 1980 
first the military budget increased 100 percent from 150 
billion to 300 billion today money was literally stuffed into the 
pentagon with too little attention paid to cost or quality as if 
money alone could buy us security 
we need a strong defense but we must control wasteful spending 
i want you to know that congress has passed reforms each time 
we were told by the pentagon to butt out but we said it was the 
peoples business 
in 1984 we showed them the 7000 coffee pot and asked for 
reform the pentagon said that was an isolated incident 
so we showed them the 600 toilet seat the 300 nosmoking 
sign the 9000 allen wrench all isolated incidents they said 
but we passed legislation to force competition on the 18 
billion spare parts budget 
but we knew there was more lots more we said the pentagon and 
defense contractors were too cozy the pentagon said no but we 
passed revolving door legislation stopping military procurement 
officers from retiring and going to to work on friday for the very 
same contractors they investigated on thursday 
over pentagon objections congress passed strong whistleblower 
protection for those brave people who speak out about fraud and 
waste this whole scandal unfolded because a whistleblower had the 
guts to speak out 
in 1986 congress mandated a procurement czar to straighten out 
the mess an honorable man took the job but quit frustrated that 
he was fighting and losing every time 
we legislated some good oldfashioned competition and we said 
enough to buying from monopolies 
but the pentagon the contractors and the administration didnt 
like it they howled 
they were unabashed in their contempt toward congressional 
reforms they continued to try to water them down repeal them or 
ignore them 
now in this tterrible scandal there has apparently been the 
ultimate contempt as many as 50 consultants buying secret 
information to destroy competition and cheat all of us 
it is difficult to see six years of bipartisan work foiled by 
what one news magazine calls a conspiracy of greed 
but we will learn from this and you alert citizens can help 
let us send a message through our votes that weve had enough of 
pouring billions into a bottomless money pit 
let us send a message through our votes that we want an ethical 
and honorable independent procurement system 
you know the code name for this fbi investigation is ill 
wind lets turn this ill wind into winds of change for all of 
us 
its about time dont you think

wyoming on friday becomes the last state 
to raise its drinking age to 21 confronting bar owners with a 
dilemma what to do about 19 and 20yearolds who come in legally 
thursday night and suddenly become too young to drink 
the legislature earlier this year acceded to federal pressure to 
raise the drinking age from 19 to 21 the increase takes effect at 
1201 am friday 
but state law allows bars to remain open until 2 am and 
19and 20yearolds expected to turn out in force thursday night 
for their last chance for a legal drink 
it takes effect at 1201 am july 1 and from that point on a 
bar operator cannot sell to or allow someone 19 and 20 to drink in 
their establishment said attorney general joe meyer so they 
had better clear the tables 
complicating the issue is that the law is written in such a way 
that unless city ordinances say otherwise those ages 19 and 20 
can still be inside a liquor establishment after the age limit 
changes 
its going to create an unenforceable object said police 
chief don pierson it will be totally impossible for us to 
enforce a law that allows 19 and 20yearolds in but doesnt let 
them drink the biggest problem is for the bar owner himself 
because it is his responsibility to make sure they do not drink 
bar owners can be fined 35 to 750 and receive up to six months 
in jail for allowing underage drinking drinkers 18 and under are 
handled as juvenile offenders those 19 and 20 will face the same 
punishment as bar owners said police sgt marty luna 
many communities around the state are working to enact 
ordinances to prohibit those under 21 from entering bars 
bars and taverns also have the option of not letting in anyone 
under 21 
our option is right now to make it a day early here said 
rick kilgore assistant food and beverage director for the hitching 
post inn in cheyenne we do have the option to refuse service to 
anybody so instead of going through the headaches of getting 
19and 20yearolds out of here after theyve been drinking all 
night our plan is well cut it off june 29 
kilgore said another option is simply to close the bar at 
midnight thursday 
leo mccue president of the wyoming liquor dealers association 
also said many bar owners might just close their establishements to 
those under 21 to avoid problems

it is too hard to control he said we have to police our own 
places we are the law enforcement

a foreign ministry official indicated saturday 
that the kremlin never intended to halt its troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan as it threatened and was only trying to put pressure 
on afghan rebel supporters 
the comments by deputy foreign minister yuli m vorontsov seemed 
designed to put to rest speculation that the soviet union might 
slow or stop withdrawing its troops from afghanstan because of 
alleged violations of the accord providing for the withdrawal 
he indicated the warnings were directed more at putting pressure 
on pakistan which supports the rebels than signaling any soviet 
backtracking 
we are appealing to the conscience of pakistans leaders 
vorontsov said at a news conference speaking through an 
interpreter we believe that the leaders of pakistan will realize 
their responsibility and that the worlds public will help them 
take awareness of their responsibilty 
vorontsov who helped negotiate the geneva accords also called 
on reporters to investigate alleged pakistani violations of the 
accord signed april 14 
the soviet union has been complaining almost daily that 
pakistans arms shipments to guerrillas fighting afghanistans 
government and that the location of rebel training bases in 
pakistan violate the geneva accords 
vorontsov cited specific examples of alleged us and pakistani 
support for the rebels he said a pakistani general sarfaz ahmad 
is in charge of a camp near the village of kalan near islamabad 
where 2500 rebels are training american advisers are also at the 
camp vorontsov said 
the first soviet warning of retaliation came may 28 when the 
foreign ministry said that if pakistan did not halt interference 
in the internal affairs of afghanistan the soviet union would 
draw pertinent conclusions with respect to the timetable of the 
troop withdrawal and take concrete steps 
under the accords the soviet union began pulling out its more 
than 100000 troops from afghanistan on may 15 and is supposed to 
have half of them out by aug 15 the pullout is to be completed by 
feb 15 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and afghan president najib 
warned after a moscow meeting on june 13 that pakistani violations 
of the accord would bring resolute retaliatory steps 
vadim i kuznetsov deputy head of the us desk in the soviet 
foreign ministry said in an interview the next day that the 
warning meant the withdrawing soviet troops would strike back at 
afghan guerrillas who attack them 
the united states has been supplying the afghan rebels with an 
estimated 500 million annually in arms and military supplies 
channeled through pakistan it has vowed to continue the supplies 
as long as the soviet union keeps up its military support of the 
afghan government 
the geneva accords prohibit pakistani interference in 
afghanistans affairs but weapons supply from the soviet union is 
not banned 
a separate agreement signed by moscow and washington allows them 
to continue supplying their respective allies 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 
following a communist coup there the previous year

protesters disrupted a performance of a 
play critical of the vaticans role in dealing with the nazis and 
said the production was improper during the papal visit to austria 
this whole play is a just a lie about 50 protesters shouted 
late friday during a performance of german author rolf hochhuths 
play the deputy 
police took two protesters into custody the incident occurred 
on the second day of pope john paul iis visit to austria 
hochhuths play first performed in 1963 in berlin alleges that 
thenpope pius xii failed to do enough to prevent the nazi 
holocaust 
if i were writing the play again today i would not present 
the personage of pope pius xii so favorably hochhuth said later 
during an informal discussion with the audience the play already 
is very critical of pius xii 
the plays assistant director hermann beil told the associated 
press in a telephone interview that the demonstrators 
predominantly young people shouted and used whistles to attract 
attention during the performance at viennas burgtheater 
beil said some in the audience shouted back at the protesters 
out with the nazis 
the actors occasionally stopped to ask for silence 
about 350 people were in the audience during the disruptions 
beil said 
the protesters called themselves the young friends of the 
burgtheater and distributed leaflets calling for the ouster of 
theater director claus peymann 
out with peymann some chanted 
peymann himself told the audience later i think its great 
that a public forum can arise in this theater perhaps the theater 
today has the function of presenting those questions that politics 
no longer deal with 
although critics reacted coolly to the play it became a hit and 
sparked impassioned debate over the vaticans role before and 
during world war ii 
in addition to hochhuth many jewish leaders allege the roman 
catholic church failed to do enough to prevent the mass murder of 
european jews but the current pope has strongly defended the 
churchs role during the nazi era 
john paul even brought up the subject on the current trip 
the incomprehensible pain suffering and tears still are 
before my eyes and etched deep in my soul the pontiff said 
friday in reference to the nazi murder of 6 million jews 
but he continued it would be clearly unjust and untrue to 
charge christianity with these unspeakable crimes 
the theaters production of the play sparked controversy last 
march when it was performed at the time the austrians were marking 
the 50th anniversary of the countrys annexation by nazi germany

michael dukakis and jesse jackson agreed 
saturday to an overhaul of democratic party rules and avoided the 
possibility of a contentious floor fight at next months national 
convention 
under the agreement the number of super delegates to the 
1992 convention will be cut nearly in half and all other delegates 
would be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion to public 
support 
jackson meeting saturday with local campaign officials in san 
juan puerto rico said the agreement represented a victory for 
the people a victory for democracy 
jackson had complained that party rules did not allow him to get 
the delegates he said were warranted by his popular support he had 
said that he would carry his fight to the convention floor to get 
the rules changed 
i think that weve made a lot of steps forward in a lot of 
areas that rev jackson has been concerned about said harold 
ickes who negotiated for jackson on the rules changes 
of the 643 super delegates to the convention jackson who won 
29 percent of the vote in the primaries had just 55 dukakis who 
won 57 percent of the vote had 362 according to the associated 
press delegate count 
the super delegates party leaders and politicians who 
automatically hold seats as convention delegates are not bound to 
support a presidential candidate based on results of the primaries 
or caucuses 
and while the democratic party has no winnertakeall 
states it does have a few states in which direct election of 
delegates or winnertakemore systems are used 
dukakis used both of those aspects of the partys rules to give 
him the margin of delegates he needed to clinch the democratic 
presidential nomination he also intensively sought support from 
super delegates often making telephone calls to them himself 
currently dukakis has 2384 delegates overall while jackson has 
1132 
the dukakis campaign supported the rules changes but tad 
devine director of delegate selection for dukakis said it was not 
being done to buy peace with jackson 
hardly devine said i think it represents a compromise on 
the part of both campaigns it reflects a spirit of cooperation and 
good will 
the harmony between the two campaigns meant that the partys 
rules committee meeting this weekend was being cut from two days to 
one and probably would issue no dissenting reports when its 
business was finished devine said 
both campaigns said the negotiations had been going on for 
several days and stretched into the early hours of saturday 
morning however occasional snags were still being worked out on 
some issued during the rules committee meeting as a dozen or so 
representatives of the campaigns talked in a tight huddle at the 
back of the room 
the 186member committee approved the rules changes on saturday 
without dissent but the proposals still need to be ratified by the 
full convention next month in order to take effect for the 1992 
presidential campaign 
though adoption of this proposal doesnt put us in the 
promised land it puts us further down the road said warren 
bracy a committee member and jackson supporter from ann arbor 
mich of reducing the strength of super delegates 
rep wendell ford dky kept the metaphor this may not be 
the promised land but it does represent some milk and honey 
devine said dukakis did use the current system to his advantage 
but still would have won the nomination even if the proposed rules 
changes were in place 
i dont deny that we took a look at the delegate selection 
process in 1988 and developed strategies based on the way the 
process is structured devine said 
under the proposed changes the number of super delegates would 
be reduced to 394 by denying automatic delegate status to most 
members of the democratic national committee automatic delegate 
status would be reserved for democratic governors most members of 
congress and top two party leaders in each state and the partys 
national officers 
the system would return to rules used in 1984 when dnc members 
had priority for seats at the convention but had to compete for 
them and had to declare a presidential preference 
super delegates currently represent about 15 percent of the 
delegates to the convention under the proposed rules that would 
be cut to about 10 percent 
in addition states such as illinois and new jersey which 
picked their national convention delegates directly from the 
primary ballot would be compelled to adopt systems to award the 
delegates proportionally another handful of states including 
ohio new york and florida award extra delegates to the candidate 
receiving the most votes in their primaries and those systems 
too would have to be changed in four years 
the agreement also called for nudging states toward picking new 
dnc members based on whom they support for president and in 
proportion to results of the primary or caucus in that state 
states adopting this rule would be allowed to name one extra member 
apiece to the dnc 
in other business saturday the committee voted to recognize the 
district of columbia as a state giving mayor marion barry an 
automatic seat at the 1988 convention as a governor 
the committee without debate named house speaker jim wright as 
permanent chairman of this years national convention no mention 
was made of a house ethics committee investigation of some of 
wrights financial dealings

dissident andrei sakharov joined former political 
prisoners and intellectuals at a rally saturday to demand a 
monument to victims of josef stalin it was sakharovs first 
appearance at a street rally in more than a decade 
at another demonstration about 200 people shouted freedom 
freedom and ignored police orders to disperse police detained 
at least three people 
sakharov the nobel prizewinning physicist who spent seven 
years in exile for speaking out against the soviet government told 
600 people in north moscow that a monument to stalins victims was 
essential to remembering the countrys tragic history 
the rally joined intellectuals who had been jailed or banished 
from moscow during the rule of former soviet leader leonid i 
brezhnev and those who are still trying to get their works past 
conformist censors 
flanked by a sign showing stalin on a big black boot and warning 
he is still dangerous sakharov told a silent crowd that if 
we have a memorial we have to think of everybody who died in the 
repression of hunger everybody was a victim 
later at pushkin square in the center of the city a jostling 
crowd of 200 refused to allow police to break up a demonstration by 
the alternative political party democratic union 
they applauded a man who held up a sign saying no to the 
political police break up the kgb 
sakharov 67 said the soviet unions sad past was symbolized by 
the december 1986 death in jail of anatoly marchenko a fellow 
member of a group monitoring human rights in the 1970s 
marchenkos death is thought by some to have hastened the 
decision by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev two weeks later to 
allow sakharov and his wife yelena bonner to return to moscow 
from their exile in the closed city of gorky 
others who spoke at the rally included former political 
prisoners sergei kovalev and lev timofeyev film director elem 
klimov historian yuri afanasyev and writers ales adamovich and 
yuri karyakin 
karyakin told reporters that the rally was a beginning it was 
important that there were many young people there 
a group of communist party members and nonparty intellectuals 
have collected 30000 signatures on a petition to a nationwide 
party conference to approve a monument to the millions killed in 
stalins purges the conference begins tuesday 
groups in the baltic republic of latvia and in the siberian city 
of chita have campaigned for such a monument 
klimov and afanasyev are delegates to the conference and 
accepted the petition saturday promising to raise the issue of a 
memorial if they are allowed to speak at the 5000delegate forum 
timofeyev called for greater openness about the extent of 
stalins purges and proposed that alexander solzhenitsyns 
chronicle of soviet prisons the gulag archipelago be 
published in the soviet union 
sakharovs appearance at the rally marked the first time he has 
taken part in a street protest since he and his wife campaigned for 
freedom outside dissidents trials in the 1970s 
sakharov was exiled to gorky in january 1980 for speaking out 
against the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
about an hour after the antistalin rally which was held with 
official approval the democratic union tried to hold a 
demonstration on pushkin square 
police did not intervene at first but later detained democratic 
union leader yuri mityunov and at least two other people prompting 
a shoving match with the crowd of democratic union supporters and 
onlookers 
a rally staged by another group the national front was then 
allowed to go ahead apparently because they back official policies 
and are not challenging the monopoly of the communist party 
police tried to break up the demonstrations by throwing up a 
cordon dividing them shouting at citizens to move along and 
waiting for the rest to disperse gradually 
mityunov said earlier the democratic union which was set up in 
may held a sanctioned meeting for about four hours with 1000 
participants in leningrad friday

a woman following a newspaper storys 
advice to yeast infection sufferers tossed her underpants in the 
microwave and sparked a fire authorities say 
firefighters rushed to the womans home in this south salt lake 
county community of 27000 on friday morning and quickly 
extinguished the flames but not before her microwave oven was 
destroyed and a nearby wall scorched said county fire chief don 
berry 
berry said when the embarassed woman explained how the fire 
started firefighters were hardpressed not to laugh 
its one of those things that just when you think youve seen 
everything berry said 
however berry said the incidents humorous side was tempered by 
its potential for developing into a serious fire if it had not 
quickly been extinguished there were no injuries 
berry said the woman who was not identified decided to 
cook her underpants after reading a news service article in a 
local paper quoting university of florida obstetrics and gynecology 
researchers as saying the bacteria responsible for yeast infections 
can be killed in a microwave oven in five minutes on the highpower 
setting 
the article emphasized the process only works on cotton 
underpants and also recommended the underwear be freshly laundered 
and slightly damp 
the woman was certain the underwear that caught on fire was 100 
percent cotton but fire officials believe they were probably of an 
artificial material if the underpants were indeed cotton the 
elastic material may have been to blame they said 
berry said that after seeing what happened to the womans 
kitchen he could not recommend the microwave process i just 
wouldnt do it he said 
the university of florida article said yeast bacteria can also 
be killed by soaking or boiling underwear in bleach or by ironing 
common detergents will not kill the bacteria 
antibiotics can fight the actual yeast infection but women tend 
to become reinfected possibly from wearing contaminated underwear 
the article said

of staff said saturday that serious mistakes were made in foreign 
policy under the late kremlin chief leonid i brezhnev 
the officials told reporters the soviet union allowed itself to 
be provoked by the west didnt consider political options before 
resorting to force in conflicts and mishandled public relations 
we were too carried away by polemics scoring points polemic 
points propaganda points indeed the propaganda proponent very 
often was in the way of real work said yuli m vorontsov who 
was a top official in the foreign ministry and ambassador to india 
and france under brezhnev he became first deputy foreign minister 
in 1986 
the unusual selfcriticism came at a news conference to discuss 
foreign policy issues on the agenda for tuesdays 19th allunion 
party conference a meeting of 5000 communist party members who 
will review soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs programs 
a british reporter asked what foreign policy mistakes the soviet 
union made during what soviet officials refer to as the period of 
stagnation the latter years of brezhnevs 19641982 rule 
during that period the soviet union sent troops into 
czechoslovakia to quash reforms responded to natos deployment of 
mediumrange missiles in europe by deploying its own missiles and 
sent troops into afghanistan 
in the 70s and the early 80s we used to be too forthright in 
our reaction to the arms race pursued by the west said marshal 
sergei f akhromeyev who held top military posts under brezhnev 
and was made chief of staff and deputy defense minister in 1984 
but he said the west should share the blame for the arms race 
it was the reagan administration that started that in the 
early 80s i think we had to show more initiative in finding 
political solutions political ways of reacting to the dizzying 
growth of the military budget in the united states akhromeyev 
told reporters 
since coming to power in march 1985 gorbachev has done an 
aboutface on several of brezhnevs foreign policy moves he signed 
an accord with the united states to eliminate mediumrange missiles 
worldwide and started the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
afghanistan he has not directly criticized the invasion of 
czechoslovakia but has said each socialist country has the right to 
develop independently 
the brezhnev doctrine the policy the kremlin used to justify 
the czechoslovak invasion holds that the soviet union has the 
right to intervene in a threatened socialist country 
gorbachev under his policy of glasnost has encouraged a 
reexamination of soviet history to correct mistakes of the past 
andrei a gromyko now the soviet president was in charge of 
soviet foreign policy as foreign minister for all of brezhnevs 
rule vorontsov was asked at saturdays news conference if gromyko 
was to blame for foreign policy mistakes vorontsov refused to 
criticize the 78yearold diplomat 
mistakes shortcomings drawbacks in our foreign policy at the 
time of stagnation certainly were related to people and the overall 
spirit that reigned supreme at that time vorontsov said 
all of us who worked at the foreign office at the time to 
different varying extents depending on our responsibilities are 
to blame for the mistakes and shortcomings of that time 
yevgeny m primakov head of the institute of world economy and 
international relations said the major drawback in 
brezhnevera soviet foreign policy was not considering enough 
options before a decision was taken 
alexander bovin a prominent political commentator wrote june 
15 in the government newspaper izvestia that the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan and the soviet deployment of ss20 
missiles in eastern europe were examples of mistaken use of 
excessive military force that damaged the kremlins international 
prestige

doctors will debate proposals for battling aids 
overhauling medicaid and training a new type of bedside hospital 
worker this week at the american medical associations annual 
policymaking convention 
members of the amas house of delegates which convenes sunday 
also plan to discuss a proposed ban on selling plastic handguns a 
move to put warning labels on alcoholic beverages and the 
associations stand on mercy killing 
the meeting which runs through thursday is expected to attract 
up to 2000 doctors from across the country the 420 delegates 
represent the amas 295000 members and act as a legislature 
setting policy for the nations largest organization of physicians 
the delegates will receive more than 75 reports on problems 
ranging from child pornography to the health hazards of clove 
cigarettes 
they also will consider at least 155 resolutions on such issues 
as the health risks of tanning parlors and ways to revamp the 
nations medicare health insurance system for the elderly 
aids of course is the biggest threatening health problem in 
the united states ama president dr william hotchkiss a surgeon 
from chesapeake va said last week there is still considerable 
debate that i think will take place over the issue of testing 
one resolution proposed by a group of delegates from ohio 
recommends requiring state and local health departments to contact 
the sexual partners of anyone who tests positive for the aids virus 
the proposal also recommends that all immigrants and inmates be 
tested for the virus and calls for a national catastrophic health 
insurance program for aids victims and legislation to protect them 
from discrimination 
the ama board of trustees is proposing a major overhaul of 
medicaid the nations program for helping the poor pay for medical 
care 
an ama report says the program administered by state 
governments is fraught with severe inequities its calls for 
expanding medicaid to cover an additional 27 million people at or 
below the poverty level now excluded because eligibility varies 
from state to state 
a battle may erupt over the ama trustees proposal to help 
offset the nationwide shortage of nurses by creating a new class of 
hospital workers to provide some bedside care to patients 
several nurses associations oppose the plan to create licensed 
registered care technologists under the plan high school 
graduates could begin caring for patients as assistant 
technologists with two months training they could become basic 
technologists with an additional seven months training and 
advanced technologists after nine more months of study 
their duties would include bathing patients giving out 
medication and changing bandages 
this is in no way a substitute for nurses hotchkiss said 
it is in addition to nurses 
also up for debate are resolutions calling on the ama to oppose 
socalled mercy killing or euthanasia by doctors and refrain from 
publishing articles which involve the taking of human life 
without stating the groups position 
the journal of the american medical association was criticized 
earlier this year when it published an article by an unidentified 
doctor describing how he ended the life of a terminally ill cancer 
patient

south korea observed the 38th 
anniversary of the outbreak of the korean war on saturday with 
nationwide rallies denouncing communist north korea 
officials said hundreds of thousands of people led by veterans 
and anticommunist organizations attended rallies and memorial 
services across the country no overall tally was available 
korea was divided in 1945 when us and soviet troops came to 
facilitate the surrender of japan which had colonized the 
peninsula for 36 years 
the korean war began june 25 1950 when north korean troops 
poured across the dividing line three days later they occupied 
the capital of seoul 
un forces led by us troops supported south korea while 
chinese troops later sided with north korea 
fighting raged until an armistice was signed on july 27 1953 
at least 2 million military personnel and civilians were killed or 
wounded 
bitter disputes have continued between the north and south since 
then with no peace accord and massive military forces in position 
on both sides of a truce line that has been broken by sporadic 
clashes

force have pressed to reunify the two koreas and demand the 
removal of 42000 us troops stationed in south korea under a 
mutual defense pact

communists 
the radicals also are demanding that north korea serve as a 
cohost of the olympic games scheduled sept 17oct 2 in seoul

south koreans partly because of a steady campaign by radical 
students and us demands to open the south korean market

and supporting dictatorship in south korea

for the first time in 50 years the republican 
party is close to matching the democrats in numbers a party 
adviser said saturday as former gop presidential contenders 
gathered to rally behind george bush 
bush meanwhile urged iowa republicans by telephone from 
washington to help him and underscore the enormous differences 
he had with democrat michael dukakis 
the point is i believe if we can do that and do it with 
integrity the american people are going to see the clearestcut 
choice in an election since the mcgovernnixon race in 1972 bush 
said i think we need this fall to spell it out without tearing 
him down personally 
bush spoke to the iowa republican state convention in des moines 
through a telephone hookup from the nations capital 
he dismissed recent polls showing him trailing dukakis blaming 
his poor showing on getting an early hold on the gop nomination 
since then the republican message disappeared from the political 
radar screen bush said 
it just makes me realize just how ridiculous polls are in 
early june bush said the message is dont worry about polls 
in early june 
robert teeter a detroitbased pollster for the bush campaign 
spoke to a republican unity planning session in cincinnati 
which attracted republican delegates from 24 states 
he said that while polls still indicate the gop is running 
slightly behind the democratic party in popularity the fact is 
we are doing a better job attracting the younger people 
former gop presidential hopefuls pat robertson senate minority 
leader robert dole and alexander m haig jr also addressed the 
session saying they would be surrogate speakers for bush the 
certain republican nominee 
teeter credited the baby boom people born during the 
postworld war ii expansion period for the increased party 
membership since the 1984 election 52 to 54 percent of the 
republican party members have been under age 40 teeter said 
for the first time in 50 years we are going to compare really 
close with the democrats going into this election teeter said 
to win however republicans must attract independents and some 
democrats as president ronald reagan did in the past two elections 
he said 
the tax issue is the best issue we have said lee atwater 
bushs campaign manager of the gop attack on dukakis who has 
endorsed a 115 million tax hike for his home state of 
massachusetts 
atwater branding dukakis as tax hike mike said ive 
never met a voter yet who wanted his taxes raised 
frank donatelli assistant to president reagan for political and 
intergovernmental affairs criticized dukakis saying he wanted to 
return to the weakkneed foreign policy of the past as opposed 
to reagans success with foreign policy from strength 
the former candidates all pledged to work for bush 
this election may determine the destiny of the nation this 
party is destined to govern for the rest of the century 
robertson said 
dole said that the party needed unity to defeat democrats 
we make the speeches youre going to have to do the work 
dole said think what it would be like if we lost you probably 
wouldnt want to get out of bed in the morning 
haig branded dukakis as a candidate of dangerous change 
george bush is the only candidate who can address the deficit 
he is the candidate of safe change there is no other solution and 
god help us if michael dukakis wins he is the candidate of radical 
and dangerous change haig said

sides in the debate over whether it should no longer be a 
commonwealth

religious and political leaders on the islandmunicipality of

the 1983 us invasion of grenada and radical disregard for 
selfdetermination and for human rights he said

in vieques against navy maneuvers that fishermen said ruined their

correspond to his official status diplomatic jargon for spying 
tass said a soviet deputy foreign minister alexander 
bessmertynkh told canadian ambassador vernon turner that the 
ottawa government had resorted to a new hostile action by 
expelling the senior soviet military attache and barring other 
soviet diplomats from returning 
unfortunately they didnt heed our warning that if the 
canadian side moved on to further aggravate the situation it could 
expect immediate further retaliatory measures tass said 
in ottawa canada a spokesman for foreign minister joe clark 
called the latest soviet move totally unwarranted 
this is viewed as a serious escalation in the matter and we 
cant ignore it said the spokesman paul frazer 
clark announced wednesday that eight soviets had been expelled 
and nine others previously assigned to canada were barred from 
returning canadian intelligence sources said the expulsions of 
soviets came after the canadians discovered a soviet spy ring 
the soviets retaliated the next day expelling two canadian 
diplomats and barring three others from returning 
clark then kicked out the senior military attache at the soviet 
embassy in ottawa and barred a former second secretary from 
returning 
the kremlins withdrawal of 25 of its 39 soviet workers at the 
canadian embassy will affect daily business in moscow frazer said 
american diplomats did the cooking cleaning driving 
translating and errands at the us embassy and at the consulate in 
leningrad after soviet authorities pulled out all 260 soviet 
employees in moscow on oct 22 1986 to retaliate for us 
expulsions of soviet diplomats 
tass did not say whether canada could replace the 25 soviet 
workers 
tass said the soviet union rejects spying charges leveled 
against soviets in canada as ungrounded 
a soviet deputy foreign minister yuri vorontsov told a news 
conference saturday that the soviet retaliation was not a deviation 
from kremlin chief mikhail s gorbachevs new thinking in 
foreign affairs 
i think its the canadian leaders who sin by old thinking 
when they undertake measures which cause surprise vorontsov 
said it looks like a soap opera to me 
the soviet union is a great power that cannot allow anybody to 
insult it in this way with impunity that was a totally unprovoked 
insult and there should be a reaction he said 
canadian intelligence sources said the alleged soviet spy ring 
was trying to infiltrate an electronics plant in montreal where 
naval weapons systems are built

a new campaign to get the equal rights 
amendment passed wont be limited to lobbying congress and state 
legislatures leaders of the national organization for women said 
saturday 
the era battle also will be fought at social security offices 
on college campuses and other places where women are treated 
unfairly now president molly yard said during the opening session 
of the groups national conference 
we need to invent new tactics to protest inequality yard 
told about 500 now members 
now has called on its local chapters to stage sitins at social 
security offices to protest unequal distribution of benefits and at 
college campuses where women professors have a hard time getting 
tenure and where predominantly male administrators are insensitive 
to campus violence against women she said 
our only guarantee against these things is to be included in 
the constitution she said 
we must keep the fire burning and keep those who perpetuate 
inequality uncomfortable said former now president eleanor 
smeal the way we are going to pass this amendment is not to 
worry about what people think of us 
the era was approved by only 35 of the necessary 38 states 
before a 10year time limit expired in 1982 
nows new campaign for era passage officially begins thursday 
with a rally in washington the group hopes to give congress a 
petition with 100000 signatures 
the groups leaders say the reagan administration has been

the air forces offer of 50000 to the 
parents of a woman killed when one of its jets slammed into a hotel 
is an outrage says a lawyer who is an expert on wrongful death 
but the air force says its offer is consistent with state law 
indiana law provides little in the way of damage payments when a 
single person dies which the womans family criticized as 
discriminatory 
robert and harriet goldberg of indianapolis already have 
rejected the air forces offer which doubled the original 25000 
sum and say they may take the matter to court 
they had been seeking 65 million in damages for the death of 
their daughter beth l goldberg 30 
she was among 10 people killed oct 20 when the air force a7 
fighter jet crashed into the lobby of the ramada inn airport where 
she worked the pilot who was from nellis air force base in 
nevada ejected from the craft before it crashed and was not 
seriously injured 
stanley m chesley a cincinnatibased lawyer who specializes in 
multiple death cases is not involved in the goldbergs case but 
said the 50000 offer was ridiculous 
just because someone isnt married doesnt mean their life 
isnt worth anything he said in a telephone interview friday 
theres only one way to get a full settlement take it to the 
courthouse 
under indianas wrongful death law a court can award damage 
payments to parents if a minor child dies and to the spouse or 
other financial dependents of an adult who dies however only 
medical funeral and estate administration costs can be collected 
when an adult dies who had no financial dependents 
many of the jet crash victims had dependent families but ms 
goldberg was single 
based on indiana law thats an amount thats consistent in 
this type of situation said maj derence v fivehouse of the air 
force aviation litigation section if we did somebody harm we 
pay them what we owe them by state law thats my mandate 
as of friday the air force had settled 98 of the 108 claims 
filed said fivehouse he refused to say what size settlements were 
being offered to families of other victims 
only people with dependents are entitled to love and 
affection she was such a vital part of our family goldberg said 
of his daughter the oldest of the couples three daughters 
indiana law needs to be changed because our wrongful death law 
is so archaic goldberg said i feel we have a moral obligation 
to pursue it nothing in the way of a settlement is going to bring 
our daughter back 
fivehouse said the goldbergs were given a july 1 deadline to 
consider the settlement offer so that the proceedings would not 
stall after friday the family will be sent a letter acknowledging 
their rejection of the 50000 offer 
the goldbergs then will have six months to continue negotiations 
or file suit fivehouse said it appears thats what they want 
he added 
goldberg said the family would be willing to lower the claim 
but plans to file a lawsuit if an agreement isnt reached in the 
next month 
the goldbergs 65 million claim figure was based on the amount 
of money their daughter would have made during her career the 
familys emotional devastation and the cost of psychiatric 
counseling for ms goldbergs survivors ms goldberg was a sales 
representative at the hotel 
chesley has represented families of victims in the 1980 mgm 
hotel fire in las vegas nev that killed 84 people and the 1977 
beverly hills supper club fire in northern kentucky that killed 164 
settlements for the claims in the mgm fire ranged from 1 
million to 2 million for single individuals and 7 million to 9 
million for people with dependents chesley said

iraq said saturday its forces recaptured 
two islands in its southern howeizah marshes held by iran since 
1984 and inflicted the third defeat in nine weeks on its foe in 
the persian gulf war 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia claimed the iraqis used 
chemical weapons to push enemy troops off the islands one of 
irans only footholds on iraqi soil the islands are mud and sand 
mounds linked by causeways and floating bridges 
a communique read over baghdad radio said the majnoon islands 
about 270 miles southeast of baghdad near the iranian border were 
under iraqi control by noon after a few hours of fighting 
iran admitted that its troops withdrew to new defensive 
positions in the face of an assault by massive iraqi forces 
the iranians stopped short of conceding the loss of the islands 
the wording of the reports was similar to when the iraqis 
recaptured the southern faw peninsula on april 18 and drove the 
iranians out of their hardwon bridgehead at salamcheh near the 
southern city of basra on may 25 
if the iranians were pushed out of majnoon their only hold in 
iraq would be in iraqs northern kurdistan mountains but by all 
accounts the iraqis have been active in attacking that area in 
recent days 
iran occupied the manjoon area part of the 1000squaremile 
howeizah marshes in 1984 the iraqis have about 50 oil wells 
there but these were capped early in the nearly 8yearold war 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in cyprus said iraqi 
warplanes and helicopter gunships flew hundreds of combat missions 
on saturday in support of the attack on majnoon the agency said 
the offensive was launched before dawn 
it said the air strikes inflicted heavy troop and armor losses 
while destroying iranian field headquarters and two antiaircraft 
missile batteries 
the report quoted military communiques as saying fighterbombers 
also hit the hamid military base east of the battle zone and 
knocked out a bridge in the same area to prevent the iranians from 
sending in reinforcements 
iraqi infantry units supported by tanks cut an embankment 
linking the islands with the iranians reinforcements which were 
advancing the agency reported 
the report said iraqi troops attacked the islands from the north 
and south it said hundreds of iranian corpses were floating in the 
marshes as the iranians retreated 
tehran radio said the islands were defended mainly by the badr 
division a unit of dissident iraqi shiite moslem rebels opposed to 
the baghdad regime and armed by iran 
but reliable western military sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the iraqis had 2000 tanks and 600 artillery pieces 
for saturdays offensive the iranians they said only had about 
60 tanks and a handful of artillery guns 
baghdad radio said jubilant iraqis marked the victory by firing 
a 21gun salute in the capital and with nationwide celebrations 
the iraqis aggressive offensives have marked a dramatic switch 
in strategy until april they have fought the war only from 
behind their formidable sovietstyle defense lines 
an iraqi diplomatic source in london told the associated press 
by telephone last week that an assault on majnoon was imminent 
when we take majnoon well have more or less recaptured all 
the land taken by the iranians then well be able to negotiate 
with them as equals said the diplomat speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the iraqis have said for two years they were prepared to 
negotiate an end to the war that neither side appeared capable of 
winning outright but tehran has vowed to fight until iraqi 
president saddam hussein whose army invaded iran in september 1980 
after border skirmishes is toppled

former us ambassador to israel samuel lewis 
on saturday warned of a dangerous stepup in middle east tensions 
if syria deploys new surfacetosurface missiles it reportedly is 
buying from china 
i think one of the most worrisome things about the middle east 
for the next three or four years is this rising technology level 
and particularly missile technology said lewis the ambassador 
to israel from 19771985 on israel radio 
it raises the stakes a great deal and the next time tensions 
rise unless we can get a peace process relaunched i think this 
is a period of some danger in the region 
newsweek magazine quoted an unidentified reagan administration 
official last week as saying china planned to sell syria its newest 
m9 missiles which have a range of 372 miles 
syria can already hit most of israels territory with its 
sovietmade frog7 ss1 and ss21 surfacetosurface missiles that 
have a range of 37 160 and 62 miles respectively 
but israeli reports said the m9 missiles could be placed deeper 
inside syrian territory making retaliation more difficult 
i can certainly understand why the prospect of a sale of a new 
missile to syria would cause great worries here lewis said 
im sure that it will be if it is not already a matter of 
serious discussion between the united states and china but how 
much real effect we would have on chinese decisions im very 
skeptical 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs top aide yossi benaharon said 
on israel radio he had no confirmation that syria purchased the 
m9s but he said israel was deeply concerned about any missiles 
syria possesses 
now you know the syrians have missiles of their own from the 
russians and they have developed a chemical warfare 
capability benaharon said 
in other words there is a source of threat very formidable 
we are concerned to a very large extent over these 
developments 
defense minister yitzhak rabin is visiting the united states and 
is expected to raise the chinese missile sale issue with us 
officials 
benaharon said israels response to the reported sale should be 
military and political and diplomatic 
with regard to the military we have to exercise to invest 
maximum effort in order to develop the kind of countermeasures that 
would neutralize this threat he said 
benaharon did not elaborate however army chief of staff lt 
gen dan shomron warned last week that israel would respond to the 
deployment of syrian missiles in various ways including attacks on 
missile sites

the state of arkansas apparently has a 
claim to five old wooden boats discovered on the bed of the 
droughtshrunken mississippi river a lawyer who represents the 
vessels four discoverers said saturday 
but if the state doesnt claim the boats which were found last 
weekend about 100 yards from the rivers arkansas side the four 
west memphis men would probably have a superior claim over 
anybody else said attorney davis lofton 
state attorney general steve clark said saturday that the state 
would likely pursue clarification of ownership of the boats which 
one of the discoverers said may date to the 1840s but it depends 
on what the value is its not their dollar value thats so 
important but the historical value clark said adding that he 
was not familiar with the find 
don spears said saturday that he and three friends found the 
boats while walking along river bottom that has become exposed and 
cracked because of the drought that has lowered the river 20 feet 
the boats were about a halfmile from the bridge connecting west 
memphis to memphis tenn spears said 
it was a total surprise said spears 42 adding that he has 
long heard tales of the mississippi concealing sunken boats i 
think this needs to be preserved its history 
the age of the boats hasnt been determined he said 
lofton said his clients also wouldnt mind the possibility of 
making some money off of it 
however the abandoned shipwreck act of 1987 which president 
reagan signed on april 28 puts boats submerged in navigable waters 
in possession of the federal government in trust for the state in 
which the vessels are found lofton said 
a state archaeologist who examined the vessels last week didnt 
seem to think arkansas would be interested in preserving them 
lofton said 
thats why i want to read this law lofton said if the 
state decides it doesnt want the boats his clients are 
investigating the possibility of dealing with some sort of salvage 
company that has the capability of doing this 
spears said he and his friends dick suiter larry samples and 
chuck king were willing to just leave this matter up to time 
right now to see if the state lays claim to the boats 
this is very valuable suiter said were not out to get 
somebody to grease our palms this is something that arkansas 
should be proud of it could make an archaeological museum that 
could bring in millions of dollars in tourist traffic 
the commercial appeal at memphis offered a theory saturday about 
how the boats sank quoting two local amateur river historians 
kenneth marquis and mike butler as saying they may have gone down 
in a 1918 ice storm 
the bestpreserved of the five vessels may be a coal barge that 
dates to the 1880s the pair said 
columnist william thomas also reported that veteran 
riverwatchers say the wrecks have been exposed before last year 
a salvage worker used a torch to cut the metal cleats off one of 
the boats 
suiter discounted the ice storm theory if they had been in 
this storm the boats would have been crushed and theyre not 
he said in a telephone interview

a us company has designed a 
wristwatch that alerts moslems when its time to pray and even 
shows them the direction of the holy city of mecca from 120 cities 
around the world a newspaper said saturday 
an alarm sounds 10 minutes before each days five prayer 
periods the englishlanguage saudi gazette said 
the actual time is dictated by the position of the sun 
according to the koran islams holy book which also decrees that 
the faithful should face mecca while praying 
traditionally the five daily prayer calls are made by muezzins 
or priests who summon the faithful from minarets attached to 
mosques 
nowadays prayer periods are published by newspapers and 
broadcast by radio and television stations in moslem countries 
the watch has been developed by sysorex international a 
computer systems company based in mountain view calif the 
newspaper said 
the gazette quoted abdullah saadan the sysorex agent in the 
middle east as saying the watch communicates in both arabic and 
english and gives both gregorian and hijra or islamic calendar 
dates 
to overcome differences between moslem scholars over how prayer 
times should be determined saadan said the times programmed into 
the watch have been approved by several islamic bodies 
the watch comes in various models ranging in price from 85 to 
115 the newspaper said

one day after facing severe criticism from 
jewish leaders pope john paul ii on saturday cited jews and 
christians killed by the nazis and called the victims suffering 
a gift to the world 
the jewish leaders said they objected to the omission of any 
specific reference to jewish suffering in the pontiffs speech 
during his visit friday to the former mauthausen death camp 
roman catholic relations with the jews have dominated the 
pontiffs second visit to this alpine nation which is observing 
the 50th anniversary of its annexation by nazi germany in 1938 
in vienna 50 protesters disrupted a theater performance of 
the deputy a play highly critical of the role of pope pius xii 
in dealing with the nazis the protesters said it was improper to 
stage the play during the pontiffs visit to austria 
john paul traveled saturday to the town of lorch 25 miles from 
the czechoslovak border 
not far from here is mauthausen where christians jews and 
others were persecuted for many reasons including their 
religion he told 80000 people at a prayer service their 
suffering was a gift to the world 
the pontiff on friday visited mauthausen austrias most 
notorious nazi death camp where thousands of jews were among the 
110000 inmates who perished 
late saturday the pope said mass before 60000 faithful in the 
town of gork about 35 miles from the yugoslav border before going 
to salzburg to spend the night 
unfortunately today in europe even in your regions the 
ancient roots of faith are threatened in various ways the 
pontiff said turning briefly from german to italian in his homily 
he continued christians must however react as a community 
to this challenge they must unite even more and stay even closer 
together 
as he was leaving the mass and waving to the crowd the 
goldrobed pontiff caught his foot on a walkway and stumbled 
slightly an aide rushed up and kept the pope from falling 
john pauls speech at mauthausen prompted immediate criticism 
the failure of pope john paul to make any specific reference 
to the suffering of the jews while visiting the site of the 
infamous mauthausen concentration camp is a matter of deep shock to 
the jewish community said elan steinberg executive director of 
the world jewish congress 
the president of the austrian jewish community paul grosz 
added we had hoped that the pope would evoke in a clear manner 
the particularly tragic character of the jewish situation in the 
context of the holocaust 
an estimated 6 million jews died during nazi rule 
the pontiff cited four concentration camp victims by name all 
of them roman catholics 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro told reporters saturday that 
the pontiff had no intention of slighting jews navarro said the 
pontiff mentioned the jews who died at mauthausen during a brief 
stop at a memorial plaque set up in their memory 
on thursday the pontiff met with president kurt waldheim 
despite protests from some jewish leaders the austrian president 
has faced allegations of complicity in nazi war crimes but denied 
wrongdoing 
the pope spent friday night in salzburg a scenic city in 
northwestern austria he has been delivering his speeches in german 
throughout the trip 
in lorch john paul cited concerns of workers and farmers in the 
area many of the farmers in the far northern region are having 
trouble staying in business often forced to take second jobs to 
make ends meet 
the church stands by you when you have social and economic 
problems the whiterobed pontiff said during the outdoor prayer 
service 
the polishborn pope frequently has called for respect for 
workers rights and warned about the potential dangers of 
unbridled profitmotivated capitalism 
these are times when the hour of darkness seems to have 
descended upon us john paul said we hear daily of wars and 
suppression deprivation of rights and catastrophes 
before he spoke several local farmers and workers had stood 
before the pontiff to tell him of the economic difficulties they 
have been facing 
about 85 percent of austrias population of 75 million people 
is roman catholic 
during the play late friday night about 50 protesters stood up 
during the performance this whole play is a just a lie they 
shouted 
police intervened and took two of the protesters into custody 
rolf hochhuths play alleges that thenpope pius xii failed to 
do enough to prevent the holocaust

was 6 feet in diameter by square footage saturdays 
longandnarrow version was considerably larger wobby said 
there is currently no separate entry in the guinness book of

the minedamaged us missile frigate 
samuel b roberts was towed out of dubai saturday toward a persian 
gulf island to be loaded aboard a specially built cargo vessel that 
will take it back to the united states 
the 3600ton frigate was severely damaged when it hit a 
submerged iranian mine april 14 it underwent preliminary repairs 
at a dubai shipyard and will be rebuilt in the united states us 
officials say 
the mighty servant 2 a 25743ton dutch cargo ship chartered by 
the navy to carry the roberts was anchored off abu nuayr island 
60 miles west of dubai 
it was to be partially submerged to allow the frigate to be 
floated onto its deck 
the tricky loading operation was in danger of being delayed by 
rough seas gulfbased shipping sources reported speaking on the 
condition of anonymity 
threefoot swells were reported off abu nuayr they said 
associated press photographer greg english said the samuel b 
roberts which nearly sank after the mine ripped a 25foot gash in 
its hull looked normal as it was towed from dubais busy port 
by the tugboat tornado 
he said the frigate was about 12 miles from its rendezvous with 
the mighty servant 2 when the towline was lost and the frigate 
continued under its own auxiliary power 
most of the frigates 225 crewmen have returned to the united 
states but 30 stayed behind to go home with the ship 
the blast which wounded 10 crewmen occurred as the ship tried 
to back out of what us officials said was a newly laid minefield 
in a main shipping channel 50 miles northeast of qatar 
the united states retaliated four days later with attacks on two 
iranian oil platforms triggering daylong naval clashes in which 
six iranian vessels were sunk or damaged 
although abu nyayr is in an area where iranian gunboats have 
attacked commercial shipping the sources said a 5mile exclusion 
zone was in effect around the island 
another us frigate the elmer montgomery was on guard duty in 
the area they reported english said the italian frigate espero 
was also in the area 
the us navy says the roberts will go first to its home port at 
newport ri and then to the bath maine shipyard where it was 
launched two years ago 
us officials denied reports the ship was judged a writeoff 
and will be scrapped 
the uss samuel b roberts is going to bath iron works to be 
repaired period said cmdr mark baker a navy spokesman at the 
pentagon 
his comment followed a report in britains guardian daily 
quoting foreign naval sources in the united arab emirates as 
saying the ship has a broken back with only its electronics 
gear salvageable 
the guardian said the ship was kept in drydock to prevent the 
full extent of damage from being revealed possibly leading to 
congress conducting a new inquiry into the us role in the gulf 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus quoted the newwspaper as saying the ships return home was 
a coverup to conceal the loss of the 300 million vessel 
us officials said the day the frigate was mined that its back 
was broken by the blast which wrecked the engine room triggering 
fires and flooding 
they later said the ship was saved only by the crews actions 
and by its having been at general quarters with watertight doors 
closed when it hit the mine 
us officials also said the samuel b roberts was taken to 
dubai because it had a shipyard facility capable of handling the 
preliminary repair work 
iran has not acknowledged laying the mine 
but us officials said several other mines found and destroyed 
in the area were identical with iranian mines found earlier in the 
gulf they said the latest ones bore no marine growth indicating 
they had been in the water only a few days

a puerto rican separatist wanted in the 
united states has been granted political asylum in mexico and 
paroled after serving five years of an eightyear murder sentence 
news reports said saturday 
william morales 37 was released from prison at 9 am friday 
but authorities did not confirm it until late afternoon the 
reports in the leftist newspapers la jornada and uno mas uno said 
the united states wanted him extradited to serve out a prison 
sentence on weapons and explosives charges but mexico decided this 
month that his was a political case not covered by the extradition 
treaty between the two countries 
us officials say morales is a bomb maker for the puerto rican 
separatist group armed forces of national liberation or faln he 
was convicted in 1979 after an explosion at a clandestine bomb 
factory new york the explosion shattered his arms and left him 
badly disfigured 
morales escaped from the prison ward of bellevue hospital in new 
york a month after he was sentenced to a 29 to 89year prison term 
on on state charges and up to 10 years on federal charges 
he made his way to mexico where he was taken into custody in 
1983 he was sentenced for his role in the death of one policeman 
and the wounding of another on may 26 1983 near the central city 
of puebla and for entering mexico illegally 
la jornada which has been following morales case closely 
reported that federal interior department immigration agents took 
charge of the prisoner after his release 
all government offices were closed saturday and it was not 
possible to learn morales whereabouts 
the competing uno mas uno newspaper quoted a city government 
statement as saying that the parole was granted after 5 years and 
27 days in agreement with policies that allow release for 
prisoners who have served twothirds of their sentence 
la jornadas original report on the mexican government decision 
quoted a resolution signed by foreign minister bernardo sepulveda 
as saying that morales was granted asylum on grounds he was a 
political fighter 
it said the resolution concludes that morales did not arrive 
at producing harm to society or any individuals in particular 
except those he inflicted upon himself 
a foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the report on the 
resolution 
in a phone interview with the associated press after the foreign 
ministrys decision was announced morales said it was a 
political recognition of our fight for independence 
the us embassy said it was disturbed that mexico would 
consider a convicted felon worthy of the status of a political 
refugee

the usbacked rebels on saturday 
refused to return to managua for peace talks with the leftist 
sandinista government 
a spokesman for the rebels known as contras said the capital 
doesnt have a favorable atomosphere for negotiations because 
the government wants to put too many restrictions on rebel 
negotiators 
the sandinistas had proposed a fourday round of peace talks 
beginning sunday in managua 
as an alternative to another formal round of talks they offered 
to meet with the rebels in miami to discusss extending the 
ceasefire contra spokesman roberto ferrey said resistance leaders 
would reply to that offer on monday 
ferrey said in a telephone interview from miami that nicaraguan 
resistance leaders complain the government will not let them meet 
with opposition parties in managua and also wants to restrict 
contra negotiators to their hotel 
the sandinistas put similar restrictions on the rebel 
negotiators during the previous round of talks which fell apart on 
june 9 
despite the breakdown the sandinistas said they would maintain 
a unilateral ceasefire the contras agreed to go along since 
then both sides accused the others of violating the fragile truce 
the ceasefire is to expire at the end of the month 
the sandinistas and the contras began direct toplevel talks on 
how to end their nearly 7yearold war in march the two sides have 
been unable to agree on key points such as democratic reforms in

sponsor another round next month in the united states 
a communique at the end of two days of talks said the july 11 
meeting will be at the experts level at an undisclosed place in 
the united states it said foreign ministers will not attend

about a dozen leaders of the four delegations worked out 
communique details in a poolside meeting after full negotiations 
apparently bogged down in the hotel conference room 
the venue for the next talks was apparently the main point at 
issue the angolacuba side was said to be opposed to holding the 
next round in an african country like egypt they felt south africa 
gained too much politically from having its officials appear where 
they normally are barred because of opposition to apartheid 
south africas foreign minister rf botha described the 
mornings talks as good excellent in keeping with a news 
blackout imposed friday all delegates declined to discuss 
substance 
botha told reporters friday his government was insisting on 
cuban troop withdrawal from angola as a prerequisite for namibian 
independence 
at friday negotiations botha demanded cuba set a date for 
pulling out its more than 50000 troops from angola conference 
sources said 
angola is demanding an end to south african military and 
logistical support for angolan rebels of unita the national union 
for the total independence of angola unita which has been 
fighting the marxist central government in luanda also obtains 
arms from the united states 
in 1978 the united nations revoked south africas league of 
nations mandate in namibia and called on the pretoria government to 
relinquish the territory the resolution also provided that namibia 
be put under un trusteeship pending independence

know how many people were in the bus at the time

friends and literary contemporaries of jack 
kerouac reunited saturday to remember the man who defined the 
beat generation of the 1950s 
a replay of kerouacs reading of the final paragraph of his 
classic novel on the road from a 1959 television show 
culminated the dedication of a oneacre park commemorating the 
lowellborn author 
the 90minute ceremony attended by about 1000 people including 
two of kerouacs three wives and poets allen ginsberg and lawrence 
ferlinghetti officially opened the first public memorial to 
kerouac in lowell and sought to settle past controversy over the 
project 
ultimately the quality of the work overshadows all the other 
issues said lowell mayor richard howe one of the fundamental 
principals of the park is to encourage the free exchange of ideas 
some residents had opposed the memorial because of kerouacs 
heavy drinking and itinerant unconventional lifestyle 
the 100000 memorial is an arrangement of 3by8foot granite 
panels bearing 15 passages from most of kerouacs 20 books and 
essays including the socalled lowell novels doctor sax and 
the town and the city previously the only reference to 
kerouac was his small grave marker on the other side of the city 
i feel very good about this memorial said ginsberg who met 
kerouac when both were students at new yorks columbia university 
in the early 1940s its so that any kid in the next century can 
wander in here and be inspired to language and imagination 
the inscribed panels fit into the park as smoothly as the 
merrimack flows through the city he loved so dearly said stella 
sampas kerouac who married kerouac several years before he died of 
a hemorrhage as a near recluse in st petersburg fla 
the dedication was the first meeting between stella kerouac and 
edith parker his first wife since kerouacs funeral 
to me i see jack as a friend lover and a husband said 
parker 66 of detroit i dont think of him as any different 
friday night parker said she and ginsberg placed a bottle of 
cheap wine on kerouacs grave 
kerouacs only child janet michelle kerouac daughter of his 
second wife joan haverty also attended the opening 
i have such mixed feelings about him and about the park 
said janet kerouac 36 who met her father only twice i probably 
see jack kerouac different than most 
several dozen people from quebec the native home of kerouacs 
parents spoke in french to priests and friends from kerouacs 
boyhood neighborhood across the merrimack river from the park 
while fans wearing kerouac tshirts and carrying copies of his 
books wandered the memorial 
watching the ceremony from a quiet corner was henri cru one of 
kerouacs best friends and the model for the character remi 
boncoeur in on the road 
when jack and i were sitting around new york talking of going 
to sea we dreamed of a lot of things he said but there was 
nothing like this

at least 200000 supporters of opposition 
presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas filled the downtown 
zocalo plaza for a massive closing campaign rally saturday 
some polls indicate that cardenas candidate of the leftist 
coalition democratic national front could finish second to 
governing party candidate carlos salinas de gortari in the july 6 
election 
usually the conservative national action party finishes 
runnerup to the virtually omnipotent institutional revolutionary 
party or pri 
cardenas son of the late president lazaro cardenas and a 
onetime governor of central michoacan state broke with the pri 
last year after his democratic current campaign for reform from 
within was rebuffed 
he insists he will win although the pri never has lost a 
presidential election or gubernatorial race in any of mexicos 31 
states since its founding in 1929 
our victory will be clear and without a shadow of doubt 
cardenas told the packed zocalo 
it cant be hidden the possibility of an electoral fraud is 
in the minds of all mexicans we know the evidence of how it is 
being prepared he said 
we are struggling for a government of liberties where we all 
might be equal before the law and that no limitation whatsoever 
might be imposed on the exercise of the rights of ideas writing 
and publishing of seeking redress of transit of professing 
religious belief cardenas said 
ours is a clear defined plan it is progressive democratic 
nationalist 
salinas de gortari and his four opponents are traveling 
throughout mexico in the campaigns closing days closing rallies 
are set as late as july 2 
rosario ibarra de piedra candidate of the tiny revolutionary 
workers party called her supporters to the zocalo on sunday 
manuel j clouthier of national action known as pan attracted 
an estimated 30000 supporters to a closing rally friday in 
hermosillo capital of northwestern sonora state he plans to hold 
his closing zocalo rally on july 2 
the fifth candidate is conservative gumersindo magana of the 
smallest party competing the mexican democratic party 
cardenas strong showing prompted an endorsement by heberto 
castillo of the mexican socialist party ballots still will have 
both candidates but votes for castillo will be counted as votes 
for cardenas 
castillo was a featured speaker at cardenas zocalo rally 
the leftist daily la jornada estimated on saturday that the 
zocalo filled to capacity could accommodate 292297 people but 
according to the survey done by architects and civil engineers 
none of them would be able to move 
most estimates of the zocalo have been that at capacity it could 
hold as many as 1 million people 
spectators at saturdays rally said the plaza bordered by such 
landmarks as the national palace and the metropolitan cathedral 
clearly was filled to capacity and many were standing in 
surrounding streets 
la jornadas study found that a realistic estimate of a filled 
to capacity rally would be 194865 people

a selfproclaimed electronics surveillance 
expert was accused saturday of turning over blank tapes to federal 
authorities after claiming they would reveal the tawana brawley 
rape case as a hoax 
samuel mcclease 26 was ordered held without bail after federal 
officials charged him with one count each of obstruction of justice 
and perjury 
mcclease had publicly claimed monday that the rev al sharpton 
one of the advisers of the black 16yearold wappingers falls girl 
who said she was raped by six white men last november had hired 
him to bug conversations involving her two lawyers activists c 
vernon mason and alton maddox jr 
mcclease said two of the eight hours he taped showed that the 
three men who have advised the girl not to cooperate with a grand 
jury or investigators knew miss brawleys story was groundless 
although hospital tests found no sign of rape after miss brawley 
was found last november in a plastic bag smeared with dog 
excrement and racial epithets the case has become a civil rights 
cause mason maddox and sharpton say miss brawley is the victim of 
a racist coverup 
this is of course another unexplained development in a case 
that has been full of many surprising twists and turns said 
scott greathead first assistant state attorney general at a news 
conference following mccleases detention hearing 
us magistrate kathleen roberts continued the hearing until 
monday afternoon after assistant us attorney federico virella 
asked for time to gather witnesses 
virella charged that mcclease 26 of jersey city nj had 
played games with the government and was a very very serious 
risk to flee 
in a complaint signed by fbi special agent judith k lewis the 
government charged that mcclease turned over two reels of 
reeltoreel tape and eight cassette tapes all of which were 
blank the two reels appeared never to have been used ms lewis 
said 
on saturday sharpton said he wasnt surprised that the tapes 
were blank 
i think what this does is confirm what weve been saying all 
along sharpton said theres a concerted effort to discredit 
black leadership in general me in particular for the last few 
months this man being exposed as a liar shows that 
according to the government complaint mcclease first appeared 
before the federal grand jury on wednesday and refused to produce 
the tape recordings us district court judge shirley wohl kram 
then ordered him to do so and gave him a highly limited form of 
immunity solely for the act of producing the tapes for the grand 
jury 
the complaint said mcclease a former navy technician appeared 
again on thursday and turned over what he said were original tapes 
of conversations among the brawley advisers 
the tapes were turned over to the fbi for duplication the 
complaint said during the course of duplication fbi audio 
technicians determined by observing the audio level that all of the 
original tapes produced by mcclease were blank and that in their 
opinion the two reels looked fresh and never used 
mason and sharpton have disavowed knowing mcclease and suggested 
he is a government agent 
us attorney rudolph giuliani said the investigation into 
mccleases allegations would continue but he refused to say 
whether the government believes any recordings exist from 
wiretapping of mason and maddox 
i think its appropriate at this point to say that any 
suggestion that the rev sharpton was involved would be unfair 
giuliani said 
sharpton is under investigation by the internal revenue service 
for failure to file income taxes and reportedly by a state grand 
jury for alleged personal use of charitable donations

three more workers died saturday from 
burns suffered in a fiery explosion at a gasoline supply depot 
bringing to seven the number of confirmed dead in the fire 
hospital officials said 
the government petroleum monopoly pemex which owns the tank 
farm confirmed that seven men died and said five were injured it 
said the blaze may have started when gasoline spilled into an 
area where soldering work was being done 
neighborhoods surrounding the san rafael sales agency in 
guadalupe filled up once again as thousands of twiceevacuated 
residents returned home 
firefighters thought they put out the blazes early friday and 
most residents went home only to flee again in panic a short time 
later when a tank reignited 
the constructora quiroga y villarreal company was doing 
maintenance work on a fire prevention system thursday when a 22 
milliongallon gasoline tank exploded and ignited two other tanks 
it was the second major fire at a pemex gasoline storage depot 
in a month 
two men died saturday of burns at the hospital 21 in monterrey 
said sergio cardenas a shift assistant 
a third man died saturday at the citys uiversity hospital said 
jose angel medellin an official at the hospitals morgue 
company clerk pedro salas said 13 workers were accounted for 
after having been reported missing after the blast 
a pemex news release saturday said the fire was extinguished at 
3 am and the security of the area has been totally 
reestablished 
across from the explosion site life began returning to normal 
young boys rode bicycles outside the depots cement walls others 
peeked through gaps in the wall to see the charred remains of the 
tanks 
its good to be home said 28yearold angel reymundo 
delgado he said he spent two nights at one of the emergency 
shelters set up after the disaster 
the first night i stayed in a cattle stall so i didnt get 
much sleep but last night was better he said 
one shelter was at the guadalupe exposition ground which houses 
an annual cattle show and fair 
silvia diaz martinez 30 who lives across the street from the 
tanks said she came home to find milk was sour and meat was 
spoiled in the refrigerator

until just after we got home she said 
ms diaz said she was trapped in her house with her mother 
sister and nephews for several minutes after the explosion as smoke 
and fire billowed toward her house 
no damage to homes was reported 
pemex said it set up a special blast investigation team the 
tank farm was temporarily closed for the investigation its 23 
tanks supplied gasoline and diesel fuel to area gas stations and 
other users 
witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said they saw 
the top of one tank rupture outward and then collapse they said 
gasoline gushed down the side of the tank and across the ground 
the witnesses said they suspected the tank may have ruptured 
because it was filled far beyond capacity pemex has said only 
there was a gas leak in a tank guadalupe mayor adan lopez said in 
an interview that it was his obligation to ask the state 
government to relocate the tank farm because it posed a constant 
hazard 
pemex closed down a similar tank farm in chihuahua capital of 
the northern state of the same name a month ago following an 
explosion and daylong fire no one died in that accident

the metropolitan club the last major menonly 
club for washingtons elite has followed in the tracks of the 
cosmos club and voted to accept women as members its president 
said saturday 
john dh kane said the vote by the clubs 15member governing 
board was taken wednesday and members were notified by letters that 
arrived in the district of columbia on saturday 
we thought it was an idea whose time had come kane said 
the board made a policy change to accept ladies in membership for 
all categories 
the vote was taken just four days after washingtons private 
cosmos club voted to accept woman and two days after the supreme 
court upheld a new york city law aimed at requiring the admission 
of women to big private clubs where important business dealings 
often occur 
kane refused to discuss any specifics of the vote or the 
procedures for acceptance into the exclusive 2200member club he 
said the clubs decision to admit women was not based on the cosmos 
club precedent or other pressures 
john f banzhaf iii a professor at george washington 
universitys national law center and an opponent of sex 
discrimination at private clubs disagreed 
once the cosmos club made its decision it was almost 
preordained that the metropolitan club would have to go the same 
way banzhaf said 
banzhaf who filed a complaint against the cosmos clubs 
menonly membership policy last year had taken similar action 
against the metropolitan club on tuesday based on a district of 
columbia ordinance stating that any club with a liquor license may 
not discriminate in its membership 
banzhaf said his next targets under the antidiscrimination law 
will be three local clubs that admit only women to full membership

us attorney robert merkle who won praise 
for recent convictions he obtained against a top colombian drug 
czar plans to resign and run for the us senate a magazine 
reported 
a brief item in the washington whispers section of the july 4 
issue of us news amp world report says merkle will challenge fellow 
republican us rep connie mack in floridas september primary 
mack of cape coral is the lone republican in the race for the 
senate seat being vacated by threeterm democrat lawton chiles 
four democrats also are seeking the post 
merkle 44 could not be reached for comment at his home or 
tampa office on saturday and did not return telephone calls from 
the associated press his secretary dot bunger said she knew 
nothing about any political plans her boss might have 
but she announced that merkle nicknamed mad dog while at 
notre dame for his aggressiveness on the gridiron is planning a 
series of news conferences around florida on monday 
florida republican leaders could not confirm merkles reported 
political debut but expressed dismay at that prospect 
he got headlines out of the drug case and he thinks hes 
really riding high right now but thats not going to do it 
said former state gop chairman tommy thomas of panama city hes 
making a tragic mistake getting in there because mack has the 
backing of the republican party in this state 
floridas current gop chair jeanne austin said candidates 
normally would check with the party before launching campaigns but 
she said she has never met or spoken to merkle and she noted that 
macks wellorganized campaign has tied up most republican donors 
mack has all the big name givers it would be hard to get in 
this late ms austin said of the federal prosecutor 
macks communications director mark mills said he couldnt 
believe that merkle would run he also shrugged off the magazines 
report that the white house is unlikely to endorse mack over merkle 
president reagans coming to florida for us to campaign in 
miami on wednesday mills said 
merkle was named us attorney for floridas middle district in 
1982 since then he has obtained indictments against three sitting 
florida representatives two judges three prosecutors and dozens 
of bankers attorneys and postal workers 
he has threatened to resign several time recently when the white 
house reportedly offered to drop an indictment against panamanian 
leader gen manuel noriega in return for the military dictators 
departure merkle prepared one of the drug indictments against 
noriega 
merkle is best known for the trial of colombian carlos lehder

a group led by the investment bank paine webber 
group inc said saturday it agreed to acquire braniff inc in a 
leveraged buyout that valued the moneylosing airline at 111 
million 
the investor group bia acquisitions also appointed five top 
executives who resigned from piedmont airlines friday to manage 
braniff 
we intend for braniff to become a strong competitive force in 
our nations air travel and hospitality industries jeffrey r 
chodorow a bia official said in a statement 
bia did not elaborate on its plans for braniff and officials in 
the investor group could not be reached for comment but in recent 
weeks the group has pledged to expand the dallasbased airline and 
protect the jobs of its employees 
braniff once the countrys eighthlargest carrier before it 
declared bankruptcy in 1982 and laid off thousands of workers 
employs 1300 people in dallas and 2600 total 
bia agreed to buy braniff from dalfort aviation inc which is 
owned by the pritzker family of chicago bia is paying 7 a share 
in cash and a pro rata share of 20 percent of the restructured 
airline for each share of braniff common stock 
the agreement capped two weeks of negotiations between dalfort 
and bia dalfort turned down a previous offer from the investor 
group about four months ago 
william g mcgee will take over as chairman chief executive and 
president of braniff mcgee was chairman and chief executive of 
piedmont and helped build that airline into the nations 
ninthlargest carrier and one of the most profitable airlines 
before it was acquired by usair last year 
braniffs departing vice chairman and chief executive officer j 
patrick foley was quoted as saying that the companys new board of 
directors and management would be in dallas monday 
i believe those who are coming in know the business foley 
was quoted as saying in early sunday editions of the dallas times 
herald if you analyze what braniff is today and what piedmont 
was 10 years ago you can see very similar airlines 
the newspaper quoted foley as saying part of the financing for 
the buyout would come from the sale of some of the companys assets 
braniff posted a net loss of 81 million in the first quarter 
of this year 
reports earlier said fort worthbased american airlines was 
considering the purchase of 40 million of braniffs assets 
including terminal gates at dallasfort worth international airport 
braniff primarily serves the southwest but analysts have 
speculated that it may try to reduce its operations at dallasfort 
worth where there is strong competition between fort worthbased 
american airlines and atlantabased delta airlines and expand 
operations at its second hub at kansas city international airport 
where competition is less severe 
foley was quoted as saying he believes the group will keep 
braniffs headquarters in dallas but expand its kansas city mo 
hub 
braniffs new board includes chodorow a real estate investor 
who is a principal in the philadelphiabased investment firm 
coregroup inc 
other new board members include coregroup principals gerald 
broker and larry d yogel new york real estate investor arthur g 
cohen and one of his associates steven m terk attorney marvin 
tepper and joseph steuert managing director of paine webbers 
investment banking division 
paine webber will control a majority of the airline the bia 
statement said 
dalfort owned 64 percent of the airlines common stock and all 
of its series a preferred stock which gave it more than 90 percent 
of the stock voting rights

intellectuals and communist officials in the 
baltic republic of lithuania have followed two other republics in 
demanding more autonomy from moscow as this weeks party conference 
approaches the official news agency tass indicated saturday 
the communist head of the republic of latvia meanwhile 
criticized intellectuals who made radical demands for sovereignty 
at a stormy meeting of hundreds of writers artists and scientists 
this month 
a brief report by tass said a rally of about 10000 people 
called by a group of intellectuals the movement to support 
perestroika was held in the lithuanian capital of vilnius friday 
night 
perestroika refers to mikhail s gorbachevs policy of economic 
and political reforms 
several intellectuals and delegates to the party conference 
addressed the crowd paying great attention to the questions of 
national culture language history and ecology and instructing 
delegates what to say in moscow tass said 
the 19th allunion conference of the communist party scheduled 
to open tuesday will be the first since 1941 five thousand 
delegates will attend 
a similar meeting in the estonian capital of tallinn june 17 is 
reported to have attracted 150000 people who cheered speeches 
demanding the soviet union turn into a federation of sovereign 
republics 
tass did not say if similar demands were raised at the vilnius 
meeting 
but the lithuanian information center an emigre group in new 
york said it had learned that a communist official in lithuania 
algirdas brazauskas addressed the meeting calling for a sovereign 
lithuania and for lithuanian to be made the official language of 
the republic 
the issue of preserving indigenous language and culture in the 
baltic republics has evoked strong emotions as a large number of 
ethnic russians and other ethnic groups migrate into the area 
the lithuanian writers union demanded april 4 that 
duallanguage schools be abolished in the republic and that 
lithuanians outside the republics borders be taught in lithuanian 
ethnic estonians are now in a minority in their own republic a 
fact that is fueling concern about the economic ecological and 
other consequences of more than 40 years of soviet rule 
the presence of leading communist party officials at the rally 
in lithuania as in that in estonia indicates that demands in both 
republics for more genuine autonomy from moscow have the official 
backing of the party hierarchy 
however the head of latvias communist party boris pugo 
condemned some unofficial groups he accused of taking their cue 
from the west 
in an interview published saturday in the daily 
sotsialiticheskaya industriya socialist industry pugo said we 
cannot close our eyes to the fact that on the background of 
perestroika and democratization recidivists of nationalism and 
chauvinism are appearing 
some of the socalled informal groups are trying to draw 
citizens into various actions under speculative provocative 
actions written with the help of western radio stations pugo 
said 
he said such groups had been a topic of discussion at a recent 
plenum of the latvian central committee that followed the june 1 
and 2 meeting of intellectuals in riga 
few details of that meeting have been published in the staterun 
media a report in the weekly moscow news made clear that debates 
had been stormy 
pugo said that much of the criticism at the intellectuals 
meeting went ahead without the necessary political analysis 
a resolution adopted by the intellectuals and published in 
latvias staterun media june 11 contained a demand to publish the 
secret protocol of the sovietnazi pact of 1939 the pact ceded the 
three baltic republics to moscow which sent in troops in 1940

precautions taken by health care workers to 
protect themselves from the aids virus have led to a shortage of 
the latex and vinyl gloves used in the medical profession 
it is difficult to pinpoint the degree of the shortage because 
manufacturers are reluctant to release production figures and such 
numbers are not available from industry groups or the government 
but there is general agreement that availability has sharply 
declined in the past year since federal health officials urged 
health care professionals to take increased care to protect 
themselves from disease organisms that can be transmitted through 
body fluids 
there does seem to be a shortage of gloves in the united 
states said dr j thomas lowe spokesman for the us food and 
drug administration in washington which regulates the medical 
glove industry the glove industry is continuing to gear up the 
production and marketing of gloves to meet the increased demand 
the sharp and relatively sudden increase in glove use put a 
pinch on manufacturers capacity said les jacobson a spokesman 
for baxter international in deerfield ill a major producer of 
medical gloves 
the immediate cause was probably the encouragement of the cdc 
centers for disease control and the american dental association 
urging doctors and dentists to glove up whenever they come in 
contact with a patients body fluids jacobson said for many 
health care workers that was all the motivation they needed to 
glove up 
our demand has doubled in the last two years 
jeff leebaw spokesman for johnson amp johnson in new brunswick 
nj said his companys glove manufacturing plant in arlington 
texas has been operating 24 hours a day for more than a year and 
is planning to add more production equipment 
also he said the company has canceled glove orders from 
nonmedical customers 
the demand has increased quite a bit in connection with the 
aids problem and the concern in general with disease 
transmission leebaw said 
jacobson said the shortage is mainly a matter of production 
capacity rather than a shortage of the materials needed to make 
the gloves latex the glove of choice for surgeons is made from 
rubber while vinyl gloves are totally synthetic 
baxter last year constructed a new glove plant in malaysia and 
is planning another facility there jacobson said the company also 
has four us plants and three in europe 
judy smith a spokeswoman for emory university hospital in 
atlanta said the hospital has felt the shortage though it has not 
reached the point where medical service would be threatened 
instead she said it has more often been a problem of 
convenience with emory personnel sometimes not able to get the 
type or size of glove they want 
but we have not had any problems that would have resulted in a 
slowdown or shutdown in service she said 
because emory is an established hospital its list of vendors is 
long and thus the facility has several sources of gloves ms smith 
said but its purchasers have had to work hard to make sure the 
hospital is adequately stocked 
the cdc said gloves should be used whenever an individual might 
come in contact with a patients blood which poses the greatest 
threat for transmission of the virus that causes aids and the 
hepatitis b virus gloves also were advised for protection from 
numerous other body fluids 
jacobson said he expects demand for gloves to remain high 
though it probably will level off at some point 
i dont think well get the sudden sharp increase again 
jacobson said everyone who needs to know about gloving up knows 
now

a magnetic storm expected to affect global 
communications and electric power transmission on monday may be 
less intense than originally thought scientists said saturday 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations space 
environment laboratory warned friday about the storm after the 
largest solar flare in four years exploded from the sun 
but noaa duty forecaster kent doggett said saturday he had 
amended his forecast 
we had expected the arrival of energetic protons from the 
flare and they did not arrive yet which makes me suspect that the 
amount of energy put out by the flare was not as great as 
previously expected he said 
based on that im not expecting as large of a geomagnetic 
disturbance 
mild proton radiation associated with the solar flare had been 
expected to reach orbiting spacecraft saturday 
doggett said the level of flare activity was expected to remain 
high but its effects on earth probably would be felt less strongly 
than initially predicted 
for instance the magnetic storm had been expected to push 
earths auroras away from the poles making the northern lights 
visible as far south as the great lakes boston and england in the 
northern hemisphere 
doggett said saturday however that the likelihood of seeing 
aurora displays wont be very high in the continental united 
states at least 
he said disturbances to electrical power transmission also 
probably will be less than expected 
officials cant forecast the magnetic storm with certainty 
doggett said and the possibility for a strong storm remains as hot 
gases and electrically charged particles emitted by the solar flare 
hit earths magnetic field 
the phenomenon does not directly threaten life on earth 
however it can disrupt shortwave and other communications 
including contact between airliners and ground controllers and 
longdistance phone calls 
the magnetic storm also could cause errors in the orbits of some 
satellites

mubarak awad the americanpalestinian deported 
from israel two weeks ago urged democrats on saturday to call in 
their platform for a twostate solution in the middle east 
that would be a great victory awad said at a luncheon 
hosted by margot kidder the actress and jesse jackson activist at 
the hotel where the democratic platform committee was meeting 
awad an advocate of civil disobedience urged the democrats to 
address the palestinian plight in the party platform israel 
deported awad on june 13 after 40 days in custody and accused him 
of fomenting unrest on the west bank 
awad a christian said he was thinking of converting to judiasm 
if that is the only way for him to get back into israel and his 
native jerusalem 
jesse jackson has sought to have the democrats support a 
palestinian homeland in their platform but michael dukakis the 
likely nominee has resisted 
the draft platform speaks of maintaining the special 
relationship with israel while exerting new leadership to 
deliver the promise of peace and security through negotiations that 
has been held out to israel and its neighbors by the camp david 
accords 
platform committee member james zogby a jackson adviser and 
executive director of the arab american institute offered an 
amendment calling for peace based on mutual recognition 
territorial compromise and selfdetermination for israelis and 
palestinians 
however the proposal was rejected on a voice vote after sen 
bob graham of florida speaking for the dukakis side said the 
party should not succumb to the temptation of wishing to 
impose on other parties what we think the solution should be in 
the middle east 
awad 44 who took out american citizenship while a student here 
because of visa problems said he was not discouraged by dukakis 
refusal to accept the jackson position 
awad said it was kind of a political game and involves risks 
that a president dukakis could not be expected to take in his first 
or second year in office 
i think if at least the platform would say twostate 
solution that will be a great victory awad said 
zogby said nine state democratic parties adopted platforms 
endorsing palestinian selfdetermination or a homeland he said 
they were washington vermont texas oregon minnesota maine 
illinois iowa and california 
zogby noted before the vote that in 1984 a jackson amendment on 
the middle east drew just 17 votes of support in the platform 
committee saturdays action was by voice vote but there were 
clearly far more than 17 in favor of the jackson amendment 
the luncheon drew reps bill richardson dnm and mary rose 
oakar dohio as well as richard g hatcher former mayor of gary 
ind and tony anaya former governor of new mexico

products furniture jewelry processed foods and pet foods which 
together accounted for nearly 16 billion in exports to japan last 
year 
of the united states 170 billion trade deficit in 1987 60 
billion of the shortfall was with japan american government and 
business officials have long complained that us products are not 
allowed to compete fairly in japan

consumer market by getting access to consumers commerce 
secretary c william verity said 
verity and japans minister of international trade and industry 
hajime tamura announced the pact at a news conference and said 
they hoped that additional industries would soon be added to the

discussed the eventual inclusion of about 20 products including 
medical and computer equipment

products on the shelves verity said in department stores all 
products are japanese 
japanese banks and trading companies will also try to spur sales 
of us goods 
verity and tamura declined to estimate what effect the agreement 
would have on sales of the american products in japan they 
acknowledged however that the initial results would not be 
dramatic 
we dont have flowers immediately when we try to sow the 
seeds tamura said through a translator we have to sow the 
seeds first 
tamura said that japans international trade surplus which 
peaked in 1986 has been dropping in recent months while domestic 
demand has been growing sharply he said that in the first five 
months of this year us imports to japan increased 43 percent 
over the same period in 1987 
now is the best possible opportunity for market entries he 
said 
the japanese consumer is finally coming into his own verity 
said for our part we want the japanese consumer to be able to 
buy americas best

state republican leaders saturday named 
conservative foreign policy expert alan l keyes as the partys 
candidate for the us senate seat held by democrat paul sarbanes 
who is seeking a third term 
keyes replaces businessman thomas blair who won the gop 
nomination in the march primary but surprised party officials 
earlier this month when he announced he would withdraw from the 
race because of unspecified personal and business pressures 
the special convention of the gop central committee selected 
keyes over gene zarwell by a vote of 1064 zarwell had finished 
well back in a crowded republican primary this spring 
in an acceptance speech keyes 37 pledged a vigorous campaign 
that would carry a message that freedom works in earlier 
remarks to the convention keyes outlined a philosophy that 
government programs are only effective when they empower individual 
citizens to solve their own problems 
keyes decried what he said was the emergence in the 1960s of a 
new liberal philosophy that encourages the lie that freedom is a 
choice with no responsibility 
keyes remarks were well received by the party faithful and 
seemed at least for a time to heal a bitter split in the party 
keyes inspiring vision for marylands future plus his 
rousing pledge to campaign hard to capture the senate seat really 
fired up the convention said gop state chairman daniel fleming 
with keyes on the republican ballot this fall the democrats 
better not take any voters for granted 
fleming was an earlier backer of keyes in the days following 
blairs sudden withdrawal announcement however other party 
leaders mounted a lastminute drive to recruit a better known 
candidate the effort ended late last week when us rep helen 
bentley and a mystery potential candidate decided not to get in 
the race 
keyes a former assistant secretary of state said he would take 
an immediate leave of absence from the american enterprise 
institute where he is a resident scholar keyes who has a 
doctorate in government from harvard university left the foreign 
service to serve as an adviser to the presidential campaign of rep 
jack kemp rny 
most political observers say keyes faces a longodds race to 
unseat the popular sarbanes 
following his nomination keyes held a news conference in which 
he supported further aid to the rebels opposing the leftist 
government of nicaragua and funding for the strategic defense 
initiative the star wars space shield proposed by the reagan 
administration 
keyes who is black said he opposed sanctions against the 
whiteruled government of south africa and the administrations 
policy of constructive engagement policies that he said were a 
choice between doing the wrong thing or doing nothing at all 
instead keyes argued for democratic empowerment he 
proposed spending 100 million to support black institutions in 
south africa such as trade unions and professional associations 
to increase the power base of blacks 
he criticized the us supreme courts decision that legalized 
abortion saying that issue should be left to the public to decide

portauprince haiti ap public indifference to the recent 
military coup in haiti will soon wear off and be replaced by 
renewed agitation for democracy according to prominent haitians 
and diplomatic observers 
we are living in the shadow of a volcano said one western 
diplomat volcanos sometimes erupt and sometimes they stay 
dormant for a long time haiti has been volatile and probably will 
continue to be volatile 
also commenting was the rev hugo trieste director of the roman 
catholic station radio soleil which mobilized opposition to 
dictator jeanclaude duvalier in the months preceding duvaliers 
flight to exile in february 1986 
i have to think we still are on the path to democracy but 
that path has taken a strange twist trieste said 
last sunday evening lt gen henri namphy broke out of house 
arrest forced his way into the national palace and expelled 
president leslie manigat he proclaimed himself president 
dissolved the senate and chamber of deputies appointed a military 
cabinet and announced he would rule by decree 
haitians went about their business as if nothing happened 
these same haitians took to the streets by the thousands to 
demonstrate against namphy when he led the junta that ruled after 
duvalier left and registered by the hundreds of thousands to vote 
in last novembers aborted elections 
an opposition leader trying to explain the indifference said 
most residents of this impoverished overcrowded caribbean nation 
of 6 million did not feel the change of government directly 
affected their daily struggles for food and shelter 
also many haitians felt manigats presidency was tainted by his 
acceptance of elections last january that were flawed by low voter 
turnout a boycott by more popular candidates and alleged 
manipulation of the tally by the namphy junta 
the political opponent spoke on condition of anonymity 
the roman catholic church haitis most influential institution 
issued no statement on the coup most political and labor leaders 
who did issue statements chose not to put themselves in open 
confrontation with the army 
but the stage is set for renewed conflict 
the 7000man army may not be so united as it seemed when 
leaders from all major units stood behind namphy during a short 
speech he delivered last monday on staterun television 
namphy the 55yearold former commanderinchief is in poor 
health and may be a figurehead said one highranking government 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of 
retribution 
they officers are gorillas the official said they 
cant run a government they proved that and will prove it again 
haitians are not expected to stand by idly while the army 
restricts freedom of the press rules by decree rather than by law 
and tolerates corruption and human rights abuses as it did during 
the two years namphy led the junta 
already last week aides and followers of manigat were arrested 
and held without charge and the 1987 constitution was repeatedly 
violated 
manigat provoked his own downfall by siding with col 
jeanclaude paul commander of the armys secondbiggest unit in a 
dispute with namphy he then retired namphy and put him under house 
arrest 
manigat felt the army was his biggest obstacle to reform he 
attempted to seize the opportunity of an apparent rift in the ranks 
to exert civilian control and consolidate his own political power 
he almost carried it off the army appeared to accept namphys 
ouster and also manigats reorganization of the army in which 
about three dozen officers many of them namphy allies were 
ordered transferred to lesser posts and assignments 
ironically manigat may have been thwarted by a handful of 
privates and sergeants of the presidential guard these men acting 
out of apparent loyalty to namphy appeared at the military 
leaders walledin compound on the outskirts of the capital with an 
armored personnel carrier and carried him back to the national 
palace

amid flashing sabers and swirling dust 
about 380 men on horseback staged a civil war cavalry skirmish 
saturday as part of a threeday reenactment of the battle of 
gettysburg on its 125th anniversary 
it was the largest civil war cavalry reenactment ever staged 
said kim holien a historian with the us army center of military 
history previously no more than 100 horses took part in a mock 
engagement he said 
cavalry outfits dont get a chance to show their stuff very 
often said nancy niero vice president for napoleonic tactics 
inc which organized the event on 700 acres of farmland five miles 
south of the actual battlefield 
all you see is soldiers and dust and sabres said steve 
hopkins a 27yearold copy machine technician from arthur ill 
who took part in the action 
hopkins rode with the 1st platoon of the 7th illinois cavalry a 
unit he said played afghani freedom fighters in sylvester 
stallones rambo iii 
close to 9000 men in uniform and more than 75000 spectators 
were expected for the three days of reenactments ending sunday with 
a restaging of picketts charge 
cannons boomed bugles sounded and pistols crackled as horses 
charged and withdrew several times in saturdays portrayal of a 
cavalry skirmish on the third day of the battle of gettysburg 
at one point a confederate soldier grabbed the union flag and 
headed back toward his line he was chased by several blue 
coats who retrieved the standard 
when you go up and grab somebody elses flag youre asking 
for trouble some of the people get their adrenaline going a little 
too high and are a little too eager to get into handtohand 
combat said holien who announced the action for a local radio 
station 
one confederate soldier who didnt give his name said men in 
union uniforms were a little rough with their sabers 
at least two riders required hospitalization after falling from 
their mounts during the fray authorities said 
one suffered a fractured skull and another had a leg injury 
said roseann mcglade nursing supervisor at gettysburg hospital 
she said the hospital treated about 24 other reenactors saturday 
morning with problems ranging from heat stroke to eye injuries from 
the dust to stomach pains from eating genuine civil war food 
tom mccutcheon of kennesaw ga said the danger of riding a 
horse in a battle reenactment is worth the enjoyment 
mccutcheon another member of the 7th illinois said he has 
served in the infantry and as an artillery unit neither compared 
to the cavalry he said 
the exhilaration of the charge theyre the biggest crowd 
pleasers we can ride the wrong way and the crowd will applaud 
said mccutcheon a 42yearold saddle maker and antique dealer 
the battle of gettysburg took place from july 13 1863 and 
cost a total of close to 50000 dead and wounded 
on july 3 1863 confederate general robert e lee ordered major 
gen jeb stuarts cavalry to try to break through the unions 
line 
stuart came up against several union cavalry units including one 
led by brig gen george a custer three miles east of gettysburg 
a total of 11000 cavalry soldiers took part in the actual 
engagement holien said

domestic commercial production in cuba fell 
by 32 percent in 1987 because of depreciation of the us dollar 
reduced imports and a poor sugar crop the cuban government news 
agency prensa latina reported saturday 
in monetary terms mercantile production was 4918 million less 
than in 1986 the national bank of cuba said in a report cited by 
the news agency 
the dispatch monitored in mexico city cited the depreciation 
of the dollar against other currencies and government restrictions 
against imports from freemarket economies for the decline in the 
mercantile sector 
it also blamed a drought that for the third straight year 
reduced the sugar harvest severely affected other crops and 
lowered cattle production 
sugar production which prensa latina called the basis of the 
life of the country fell 39 percent last year the sectors 
poor performance accounted for 13 percent of the drop in economic 
production it said 
nonsugar production suffered a 31 percent drop in 1987 because 
of a shortage of foreign reserves needed to purchase supplies from 
abroad the bank report said imports dropped 20 percent from 1986 
it said 
cubas total foreign trade in 1987 was unchanged from the 
previous year the prensa latina dispatch did not provide a figure 
the countrys foreign trade deficit shrank by 15 percent it said 
a severe dollar shortage forced the government to ask western 
creditor nations this year to reschedule its foreign debt over 15 
years and ask for a 5year grace period according to a national 
bank document made public in march 
the document released by freedom house a conservative human 
rights group listed cubas debt to western creditors at 55 
billion 
world oil sales are conducted in us dollars the soviet union 
has been sending proceeds of soviet oil export sales to cuba and 
so the dollars decline in value has hit cubas foreign reserves 
the decline in mercantile production did not affect the 
quality of life of the population the national bank report said 
life expectancy for men on the island nation was 7266 years and 
761 years for women in 1987 prensa latina said

some days laura steinberg works for the boston 
bar associations committee for civil rights other days she 
opposes it 
steinberg and other attorneys at bostons big law firms have 
been moving back and forth across that fence for two decades on 
one side they butter their bread on the other they soothe their 
souls 
the committee which celebrated its 20th anniversary saturday 
assigns lawyers to represent black asian and hispanic clients in 
discrimination cases the lawyers volunteer their time and 26 
boston law firms donate most of the committees 400000 annual 
budget 
those same firms however also represent many of the powerful 
organizations and individuals that the committee sues to be sure 
the lawyers follow ethical guidelines intended to prevent conflicts 
of interest and no firm represents both sides in a single case 
but the irony of bostons top lawyers and law firms donating 
time and money to take on their establishment clients is obvious 
and the committees staff isnt shy about discussing it 
weve been successful by being part of the establishment but 
at the same time being an organization that continually challenges 
the establishment said barbara r arnwine the committees 
executive director 
it has its awkward and also its amusing moments said 
steinberg who is simultaneously suing the boston housing authority 
on behalf of the committee and defending the citys water and sewer 
commission against a suit filed for the committee by another lawyer 
a harvard law school graduate and partner in the firm of 
sullivan amp worcester steinberg said she likes taking cases for the 
committee because they are often classaction suits involving 
meaty constitutional issues 
twentyfive years ago there was no civil rights act no 
voting rights act no fair housing act and precious little civil 
rights sen edward m kennedy dmass told the group at its 
anniversary dinner saturday night the lawyers committee can 
point with pride to your indispensable role in the writing of these 
laws and your equally indispensible role in securing their strong 
enforcement 
the committees bestknown suit was probably the boston school 
desegregation case of 1972 which resulted in the court order for 
racial integration of the citys schools 
but the group also has challenged hiring practices in the police 
and fire departments it brought a 1976 federal case that 
established the obligation of employers to maintain a work 
environment free of racial or sexual harassment it has represented 
victims of racially motivated violence and it has been 
particularly active in the fair housing arena 
john taylor williams a partner in the firm of palmer amp dodge 
said there are some selfinterested reasons why oldline firms may 
support the committee particularly recruiting 
whatever people may say about pinstriped lawyers there are 
still a lot of people who go to law school motivated in part by a 
desire to bring about social change he said you can often 
recruit better lawyers to your firm because they know theyll have 
the opportunity to get involved in civil rights cases 
but williams said most of the citys big law firms also 
recognize that it is in everyones interest to keep boston 
the most civilized city in america and that part of being 
civilized is not discriminating on the basis of race 
formally named the lawyers committee for civil rights under the 
law the group was formed by the boston bar association in the wake 
of the riots following the assassination of the rev martin luther 
king in 1968 
it is one of several regional chapters of the national lawyers 
committee for civil rights which had been established in 1963 at 
the instigation of president john f kennedy and attorney general 
robert kennedy 
at a time in which theres been a loss of momentum on civil 
rights issues in the public sector under the reagan 
administration in particular the lawyers committee has 
maintained the momentum of the 60s and 70s said superior court 
judge j harold flannery who worked for the committee before going 
on the bench in 1984 
its commitment is more than lip service more than just 
rhetorical he added they have jumped in and done the actual 
nittygritty legal work at considerable risk of unpopularity

two million elderly americans become ill 
or die each year because of reactions to drugs often prescribed 
unnecessarily and sometimes taken in potentially deadly doses a 
newspaper reported sunday 
the arizona republic said it found through a fivemonth 
investigation in 13 states that many institutionalized elderly are 
given mindaltering drugs that thousands have died after getting 
wrong dosages and that others were used as guinea pigs in drug 
experiments 
the newspaper said in the first installment of a sevenday 
series it had found that about one in every seven doses of medicine 
the elderly receive are in error 
of the 9 billion people over 65 spend annually on prescription 
drugs about 2 billion is considered unnecessary the republic 
said citing federal records 
officials have estimated the total healthcare bill for wrongly 
medicating the elderly at 21 billion a year the newspaper said 
rep claude pepper dfla chairman of the house committee on 
aging called the problem a national outrage 
those figures are staggering pepper said it shows how 
callous some people are regarding the elderly all they want to do 
is placate them until they pass away 
in arizona some nursing homes have made medication errors more 
than half the time they give drugs the republic said the national 
health care finance administration considers a 5 percent error rate 
acceptable 
the newspaper said it also found that 
some doctors and drug companies around the country used 
elderly patients as test subjects for experiments sometimes 
involving new unlicensed drugs without obtaining the patients 
informed consent 
numerous medical studies conducted since the mid1970s show 
the aged have been improperly given tranquilizers hypnotic drugs 
and potent antipsychotic drugs that left thousands severely ill 
hospitalized or dead 
many thousands of elderly who are overmedicated fall 
suffering debilitating sometimes fatal injuries 
most medical schools have inadequately trained doctors 
particularly in geriatric pharmacology and geriatrics 
many doctors do not want to treat the elderly nor do they 
find it financially desirable to care for them in nursing homes 
because of strict federal limitations on medicare reimbursements 
despite congressional orders five years ago to do so many 
drug manufacturers still have not tested most of their drugs on the 
elderly to determine effects and have failed to recognize the need 
for a category specifying geriatric doses in labeling and package 
inserts 
the republic also said doctors are ignorant of the extent of 
medicationrelated deaths partly because autopsies are rarely 
performed on the elderly leaving physicians often to guess the 
cause 
don goddard of sun city who founded the senior citizens segment 
of the st lukes medical center chemicaldependency unit in 
phoenix in 1974 estimated that 30 percent of the patients he met 
in 10 years directing the program were addicted to prescription 
medications most were women 
that is the drug problem with older people said goddard 
84 we dont take heroin or cocaine it would be a news story if 
we did

the democratic platform committee rebuffed the 
jesse jackson campaign on taxes defense and the middle east as it 
approved a succinct middleoftheroad platform saturday tailored 
to the stands of michael dukakis 
the panel turned aside repeated efforts to amend the platform 
with jackson campaign planks as it approved a document of barely 
4000 words onetenth the size of its 1980 and 1984 platforms 
the decisive vote came on the first amendment when the jackson 
forces sought to append their basic budget plan to the democratic 
blueprint the jackson budget plank was rejected by a 10844 margin 
and turned out to be the only issue decided by a standing tally 
later on voice votes the democrats rebuffed the jackson forces 
on attempts to put a call for nofirstuse of nuclear weapons in 
the platform and on a call for selfdetermination for israelis 
and palestinians 
the committee did make some changes on issues ranging from child 
care to the environment but only when the dukakis and jackson 
campaigns were in accord 
michigan gov james j blanchard who chairs the platform 
committee praised the final draft as a truly unique document 
i believe were going to have a victorious year for all 
democrats 
the meeting ended on a note of unity with the delegates 
unanimously adding even tougher language to their plank labeling 
south africa a terrorist state the final amendment says the next 
administration will determine a date certain by which us 
corporations leave south africa 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons representative on the platform 
committee said we feel we have achieved our goal to get 
jacksons views into the platform she said she did not know 
whether jackson would press any floor fights on the platform in 
atlanta 
the meeting lasted 11 hours and despite the rebuff to the 
jackson forces on key issues remained harmonious throughout 
mike barnes dukakis platform chief said its a great sign 
of unity what was demonstrated here is that the democratic 
party really has matured and is ready to take the reins of 
government 
richard hatcher former mayor of gary ind offered the jackson 
amendment to freeze the military budget and return taxes on the 
very richest americans to their 1977 levels and restore corporate 
taxes to their prereagan levels 
hatcher said raising taxes on those making more than 200000 a 
year would raise 20 billion for investment in education job 
training and housing for homeless and other critical domestic 
needs 
but rep robert matsui of california a dukakis backer replied 
i have never believed that the democratic partys principle and 
goals and values is to tax americans we have never said that was 
part of our heritage 
matsui defended dukakiss insistence that the government should 
step up collection of taxes from scofflaws before looking to higher 
taxes to reduce the deficit 
on the middle east james zogby executive director of the arab 
american institute urged the party to seek peace based on mutual 
recognition territorial compromise and selfdetermination for 
israelis and palestinians 
zogby said that while democrats have a commitment to israel 
palestinians too need security palestinians want what any 
other people want the right to live in peace in their own land 
free of occupation 
but sen bob graham of florida speaking for the dukakis side 
said we should not succumb to the temptation of wishing to 
impose on other parties what we think the solution should be 
on the nofirstuse of nuclear weapons amendment claire 
greensfelder a jackson delegate and antinuclear activist from 
berkeley calif was near tears as she argued let us remember 
we are the only people who have ever dropped a nuclear weapon on 
other people in the world 
but the delegates rejected the amendment after hearing rep tom 
bevill of alabama say certainly this would be weakening a strong 
defense 
the platform committee also rejected by voice vote an attempt 
to include in the platform the jackson campaigns promise to double 
the federal education budget the platform does promise to give 
education our highest priority and to expand preschool 
programs and create a national teacher corps to recruit teachers 
through scholarships 
the 44 jackson votes on the budget plank were nearly a quarter 
of the platform committees full membership of 186 ensuring 
jacksons right to force a fight on the issue on the convention 
floor in atlanta next month if he wishes 
norton said jackson told her by telephone from puerto rico 
friday night that she should press the issues on which they were 
unable to reach consensus in a spirit of collegiality and respect 
for his opponent gov dukakis 
she said jackson wanted his delegates to remember that what 
counts is the final victory we shall achieve in november 
blanchard told the 153 members at the meeting its my hope 
that our work will help elect democrats from court houses to state 
houses to the white house 
earlier the governor told reporters the document was short 
enough to be put on posters and mailed out read at the 
convention and posted on the walls of government classes 
the document titled the restoration of competence and hope 
pledges that democrats will restore competence caring and 
incorruptibility to the federal executive branch and get it working 
again fairly for all americans 
as jackson wanted it terms south africa a terrorist state 
although it does not mention president reagan or vice president 
george bush by name it derides voodoo economics 
it says democrats will promote peace and prevent war but 
not by trading weapons for hostages not by sending brave 
americans to undefined missions in lebanon and honduras and 
not by toasting a tyrant like former philippine president 
ferdinand marcos as a disciple of democracy 
it promises the democrats will seek significant reductions 
in nuclear weapons it urges more stable defense budgets and 
maintaining the special relationship with israel while pursuing 
peace in the middle east along lines of the camp david accords

incumbent vigdis finnbogadottir gained 
an overwhelming victory over another woman candidate in saturdays 
presidential election in her bid for a third fouryear term 
poll officials said early sunday that with 473 percent of the 
ballot counted mrs finnbogadottir won about 95 percent of the 
vote and her rival sigrun thorsteinsdottir had the remaining 5 
percent 
the officials said about 75 percent of icelands 173800 
eligible voters cast ballots 
in conceding defeat in a television interview mrs 
thorsteinsdottir said the election had been a great victory for all 
democratic and freedomloving people in iceland as opposed to 
the autocratic and monarchist supporters of the establishment 
she did not congratulate the 58yearold president on her 
victory but offered herself as a presidential aide saying it was 
obvious that the present aides are unfit for the job 
sources close to the president speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they could hardly envisage a situation where mrs 
thorsteinsdottirs advice would be sought 
president finnbogadottir said in a tv interview she was 
delighted b the results and that any incumbent president would be 
satisfied with such overwhelming support 
final results were expected later sunday 
vigdis as the president is popularly known among the 250000 
icelanders was the worlds first democratically elected woman 
state president when she defeated three men in 1980 
she was reelected unopposed in 1984 and was host at the 
reykjavik superpower summit in october 1986 
mrs thorsteinsdottir has been active within the humanist party 
which so far has failed to get a representative elected to the 
althing the worlds oldest parliament 
mrs thorsteinsdottir 46 ran on a platform of giving the 
presidential office a more active role 
mrs finnbogadottir maintained that the presidency was created 
as a ceremonial post and should remain so 
the president refused to run an active campaign and repeatedly 
refused an invitation from her rival to a public debate 
real power in iceland rests with the prime minister thorsteinn 
palsson 
saturday was the first time an incumbent president has faced a 
reelection challenge since iceland formerly under danish rule 
became a republic in 1944 
icelandic women recently won greater political power the 
leftwing womens alliance which made history in 1983 when it 
became the first feminist movement in the world to win 
parliamentary seats doubled its representation to six seats in 
last years general election 
the independence party is icelands largest political party and 
a dominant force in the threeparty coalition government 
mrs finnbogadottir a divorcee was formerly director of the 
reykjavik theater company 
she had no formal involvement in politics when she was first 
elected but was generally regarded as being the preferred 
candidate of the icelandic left notably because of her opposition 
to the united states military presence in iceland at the north 
atlantic treaty organization base at keflavik 
the president is traditionally a nonpolitical figure

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi 
received an award named for a slain black civil rights leader 
saturday but was criticized by antiapartheid protesters and the 
civil rights leaders widow 
savimbi 53 the president of the national union for the total 
independence of angola unita accepted the medgar evers 
humanitarian award from fayette mayor charles evers brother of the 
civil rights leader 
the award ceremony had to be moved inside city hall from the 
steps outside to avoid heckling by people protesting savimbis ties 
with whiteruled south africa which supports unitas struggle 
against angolas marxist government and has a policy of racial 
segregation known as apartheid 
the angolan people are not asking for pity they are asking 
for understanding because they have proven themselves good 
fighters we want freedom in south africa savimbi said we are 
going to do it we need your support give us that support 
on behalf of all of us freedom loving people in mississippi 
and fayette whether they like it or not we feel that you are our 
hero evers said in presenting the award 
myrlie evers medgars widow who is remarried and living in los 
angeles said thursday that the choice of savimbi was politically 
motivated and that her late husband would not have approved 
medgar evers was field director of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people when he was gunned down in front 
of his jackson home in 1963 
earlier saturday about 40 protesters shouting antiapartheid 
and antisavimbi epithets gathered outside a jackson motel where 
savimbi had scheduled a news conference they were met by a 
bibletoting prosavimbi group shouting we are against 
communism 
evers failed to calm the protest and eight uniformed jackson 
police officers forced both groups out of the hotel without 
incident 
i hate apartheid because apartheid is the black people being 
oppressed savimbi said during the news conference he added 
however that he believed progress in namibia and south africa 
depends on peace in angola 
south africa has refused to withdraw from neighboring namibia 
in defiance of a united nations resolution because of the presence 
of cuban troops in angola that support the government there 
i am not fighting a south african struggle i am fighting the 
struggle for freedom for dignity of the black people in angola 
savimbi said 
charles evers compared savimbis struggle with that of american 
blacks in the 1960s and said his brother would have approved of the 
award 
dr savimbi is a man who has fought for freedom evers said 
he fought the russians the communists and the cubans ive been 
there ive seen the work hes done 
savimbi will go to washington next week and meet with president 
reagan on thursday

massachusetts gov michael dukakis who 
finished third in iowas precinct caucuses more than four months 
ago picked up 13 of 18 delegates elected saturday at the iowa 
democratic convention 
with the 13 new delegates in his camp dukakis had 49 members of 
the states 61member delegation while jesse jackson had 12 
after launching the democratic presidential nominating process 
with the state caucuses in february iowa on saturday became the 
last state in the nation to complete its slate of delegates to the 
democratic national convention in august 
iowa democratic party chairwoman bonnie campbell told delegates 
at the partys state convention that the state has a process that 
all of us should be proud of and those who might like to see iowa 
quietly slip by the political wayside will not be so lucky 
ms campbell has promised to lead the fight against any move to 
push iowa from its firstinthenation status 
jesse jackson who finished second to dukakis in the nationwide 
delegate count has said he will push for a new system to give 
larger states a greater voice in the early nominating process 
some democrats in other states have grumbled that iowa does not 
deserve to kick off the partys nominating process because the 
state has not been carried by a democratic presidential candidate 
since 1964 
while our caucuses have had more than their fair share of 
criticisms we have shown the world that iowa is a place where 
candidates can come to talk with real live people about building a 
better world rather than spending big money on television campaign 
commercials ms campbell said

about 30 women removed their shirts in a 
city park and bared their breasts for several hours to protest a 
state law allowing men but not women to remove their shirts in 
public 
it was the third year in a row for the protest which is 
becoming an annual rite of summer 
we intend to continue this until the law is changed said 
ramona santorelli a protest organizer this is a day to 
celebrate the acceptance of women going shirtless 
barechested women played softball and volleyball and lounged 
in the sun at genesee valley park 
santorelli launched the effort three years ago after a security 
guard ordered her to put a shirt on while she was sunbathing in an 
uncrowded city park 
the first protest in 1986 attracted a large crowd of gawkers and 
hecklers who taunted the seven women who removed their shirts and 
were arrested 
the women were acquitted of misdemeanor charges but their 
victory was a partial one judge herman walz ruled it was 
permissible for the women to remove their shirts in public as a 
form of protest but said it would be illegal for any other reason 
last year about 25 women bared their breasts and enjoyed their 
picnic without interruption from onlookers or the police saturday 
was a repeat of that experience 
the event was a bit befuddling for patrick massaquoi a native 
of liberia attending a family reunion in a picnic shelter near the 
topless women 
looks to me what you have over there is western society 
degenerating massaquoi said in africa this is the custom and 
native way and you can understand it but whats good for africa is 
not necessarily good for rochester

michael dukakis gave in to jesse jackson saturday on changing 
democratic rules for 1992 but the massachusetts governor stood 
firm on keeping the partys platform short and nonspecific 
meanwhile vice president george bush savored a victory in iowa 
where his campaign had been sent into a spin by his thirdplace 
finish in the caucuses back in february 
jackson campaigning in puerto rico on saturday hailed the 
proposed rules changes as a victory for the people a victory 
for democracy 
if the rules changes approved saturday in washington by the 
partys rules committee are adopted by the national convention 
next month the number of super delegates to the 1992 
convention would be cut nearly in half in addition all states 
would be compelled to award delegates to presidential candidates in 
proportion to their support in the primaries and caucuses 
jackson had complained that current provisions for super 
delegates and the rules in a few state primaries and caucuses 
unfairly kept him from getting as many delegates as he should have 
the rules being changed were the very ones that dukakis had used 
to his advantage in clinching the democratic presidential 
nomination but tad devine the campaigns director of delegate 
selection who led the dukakis negotiating team said the 
massachusetts governor would have won the nomination even if the 
rules had been changed 
the democrats platform committee meeting in denver was 
winding up work on a statement of party principles that michigan 
gov james blanchard the committee chairman said would be short 
enough to print on a poster and mailed out a 4000word draft of 
the document is onetenth the size of the 1984 platform 
but unlike the rules committee which convened to rubberstamp 
the deals worked out in private negotiations between the jackson 
and dukakis campaigns proposals from the jackson camp on taxes 
defense the middle east and other issues were roundly rejected by 
the platform committee 
the panel turned aside repeated efforts to amend the platform 
with jackson campaign planks as it approved a document of barely 
4000 words onetenth the size of its 1980 and 1984 platforms 
nevertheless the mood throughout the 11hour meeting was 
harmonious 
the first jackson amendment calling for higher taxes and a 
freeze on pentagon spending was defeated 10844 
later on voice votes the democrats rejected jackson campaign 
proposals opposing first use of nuclear weapons by the united 
states calling for selfdetermination for israelis and 
palestinians and urging a doubling of the federal education 
budget 
eleanor holmes norton who heads jacksons platform effort said 
he told her by telephone that she should press the issues on which 
they were unable to agree in a spirit of collegiality and respect 
for his opponent gov dukakis 
one other issue the democrats need to settle before the 
convention is the selection of a keynote speaker and texas 
treasurer ann richards said she is on the short list of candidates 
being considered by dukakis and party chairman paul kirk 
im sure the fact that i have been a democrat all my life and 
active in the party and the fact that i am the first female in 
texas to hold public office statewide in 50 years played a part 
she said 
an announcement of who will deliver the conventions keynote 
address is expected this week 
jackson spent saturday in puerto rico where he tried to pry 
loose some dukakis delegates that he said should be his jackson 
won the states nonbinding primary but dukakis came away with 
almost all the delegates who were picked separately 
dukakis was taking a breather in his schedule with a weekend on 
nantucket island in massachusetts no public events were planned 
bush spoke by telephone to state gop convention delegates in 
iowa saturday saying the american people are going to see the 
clearestcut choice in an election since the mcgovernnixon race in 
1972 
in the february caucuses bush finished behind senate minority 
leader bob dole of kansas and television evangelist pat robertson 
bush recovered from the defeat with a victory in the new hampshire 
primary eight days later 
the vice president no longer has any opponents for the gop 
presidential nomination and on saturday he collected all 37 of 
iowas delegates to the national convention

turkish officials on saturday ordered 
rescue workers to stop digging for survivors of a landslide because 
of the danger of a new slide 
the decision came as west german volunteers said they were 
within a few meters yards of reaching the debris from a 
crowded coffeehouse engulfed in thursdays landslide 
up to 100 people were buried in the slide which also swallowed 
up a restaurant and an empty high school 
we are angry we should have been permitted to go on there 
is a slight chance that people are alive in the coffeehouse 
basement said hans ruhl a deputy director of the german rescue 
dog association 
rescue efforts were halted while a new causeway was built to 
carry off excavated earth 
there is constant danger of new landslide and of a cavein and 
flooding if the west germans continue we are engineers we know 
the dangers said erkan omarbeyoglu trabzon regional highway 
director 
three west germans who were in the coffeehouse were among the 
missing along with 43 turks according to regional officials 
there were reports that two british tourists also were in the 
coffeehouse but some witnesses said the two had left before the 
disaster 
it is my opinion theres little chance now for finding anyone 
alive and it lessens every hour said ruhl 
officials said it could take a month to clear 500000 tons of 
earth rock and uprooted trees blocking the road from the black sea 
port of trabzon to eastern anatolia and iran 
geologists were surveying the hillside that collapsed but it was 
not clear whether they would blast away another chunk that might be 
dislodged 
this is a great calamity for our village we had 10 buses and 
300 trucks coming through every day said riza yavuz the village 
headman 
catak lies 19 miles from trabzon among hazelnut and cherry 
orchards in the shadow of spectacular mountains 
trabzon was famous as trebizond in medieval times as the capital 
of a breakaway byzantine state and later birthplace of the ottoman 
sultan suleiman magnificent 
villagers blamed the landslide on what they said was shoddy 
construction when the highway was widened three years ago to handle 
increasing truck and tourist traffic 
the construction workers blasted the hillside and then failed to 
shore up a 139foothigh escarpment the villagers said 
i knew it would eventually collapse yavuz said 
he said the villagers appeal to the public works ministry in 
ankara just brought promises they would deal with the problem 
eventually 
the landslide hit the coffeehouse when it was full of bus 
passengers and truck drivers who had waited all night for 
bulldozers to clear an earlier rock fall blocking the road 
it was standing room only in the coffeehouse and people had 
been watching television there through the night said nizamettin 
ozturk 
ozturk said his house was flooded when a fast flowing stream 
running through the village jammed with rocks and soil and changed 
course

investigators in the pentagon bribery probe 
videotaped meetings in which defense department officials allegedly 
took payoffs from consultants sources close to the twoyear 
investigation said saturday 
the sources said that two key figures in the investigation 
victor cohen deputy assistant secretary of the air force for 
tactical systems and james gaines a deputy assistant secretary of 
the navy appear on some of the videotapes however the sources 
declined to say whether alleged bribes turned up on the recordings 
of those two pentagon officials 
the consultants shown on the videotapes also include melvyn 
paisley the former procurement chief for the navy whose office was 
searched on june 7 by federal authorities in the investigation the 
sources said 
nbc news reported friday night that cohen would leave the 
pentagon whenever a defense consultant would call that his 
meetings with consultants were recorded and videotaped and that 
money changed hands 
the sources meanwhile said that gaines also was videotaped at 
meetings with consultants in which highly confidential documents 
relating to pentagon contracts allegedly changed hands 
the washington post reported that cohen deputy assistant 
secretary of the air force for tactical systems is among those 
cooperating in the investigation 
sources close to the case said this past week that gaines is 
cooperating in the investigation those sources continued to make 
that assertion saturday while other sources and the post said that 
while gaines gave a statement to investigators earlier he is not 
cooperating with prosecutors at this point 
meanwhile defense news reported in its june 27 editions that 
paisley when he was the navys procurement chief under navy 
secretary john lehman initiated a change that effectively 
eliminated all but one company from a key procurement program in 
1986 
the change was to drop plans for separate competitions on all 
six components of the aegis weapon system and instead go with a 
winnertakeall scheme the system protects ships from airborne 
surface and underwater missiles 
the result of the change defense news quoted several 
unidentified industry officials as saying was that hundreds of 
millions of dollars in navy contracts for the aegis system went to 
sperry corp now unisys corp one of the firms involved in the 
pentagon bribery investigation 
defense news quoted sources as attributing the shift that 
favored unisys to paisleys close association with william galvin 
a consultant to the company the publication quoted several sources 
as saying that galvin had boasted about having wired the aegis 
competition in sperrys favor 
meanwhile the new york times reported in sundays editions that 
investigators probing northrop corps involvement in the alleged 
fraud appeared to be concentrating on the companys contract to 
build a navy target drone known as the bqm74c 
the drone is one of two major projects at northrops ventura 
division whose offices in newbury park calif were searched 
earlier this month by fbi agents as part of the procurement 
investigation the times citing unidentified sources said the 
other ventura project a missile known as tacit rainbow was not 
the object of the fbi search as had previously been reported 
in related news rep barbara boxer said saturday that the 
pentagon defense contractors and the reagan administration 
howled about congressional attempts to reform the procurement 
process such as a ban on military procurement officials quitting 
and immediately going to work for the defense industry 
the pentagon defense contractors and the administration were 
unabashed in their contempt toward congressional reforms boxer 
of california said in the democratic response to president reagans 
weekly radio address 
now in this terrible scandal there has apparently been the 
ultimate contempt as many as 50 consultants buying secret 
information to destroy competition and cheat all of us 
inside information allegedly obtained by consultants including 
paisley was in some cases classified and was in other cases 
proprietary information about specific companies the government 
has said in a search warrant for one company involved in the probe 
mcdonnelldouglas corp the information was sold to various defense 
contractors to give the recipients an advantage in competing for 
contracts worth billions of dollars about 75 to 100 pentagon 
contracts may have been tainted according to prosecutor henry e 
hudson 
cohens attorney seymour glanzer declined to comment saturday 
about any aspect of the investigation when asked about the 
videotapes of alleged payoffs to his client and whether his client 
was cooperating with the government 
gaines attorney michael schatzow said friday night that he had 
no comment on the videotapes but added ill just wait and allow 
everybody whos been reporting these stories to wait and be 
embarrassed later 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella denounced the leaking 
of information on videotaping 
this is just a further example of the government trying their 
case in the press rather than waiting for specific allegations to 
try in court barcella said 
cohen and gaines have been temporarily reassigned to 
nonprocurement duties because of the investigation along with 
four other pentagon employees the others include george stone a 
navy official in the space and naval warfare systems command 
stuart berlin an executive with the naval air systems command and 
marine corps official jack sherman who works in the equipment and 
service acquisition section of the contracts division installation 
and logistics department

nagy eltohamy told the associated press by telephone 
the alahram newspaper a frequent conduit for government policy 
statements was the only paper with editorial comment on the case 
it characterized the suspects as innocent victims swept up in an 
attempt to damage relations between the united states and egypt 
us ambassador frank g wisner said usegyptian ties were too 
vital to be damaged by the affair 
i think there is a very important relationship between the 
united states and egypt and problems can be managed wisner said 
the staterun middle east news agency did not report the story 
for 15 hours after it broke 
its eventual dispatch from washington quoted the washington post 
for its information but didnt mention the army colonels or a 
military transport plane the us justice department charged was 
being used to smuggle contraband out of the country 
the official cairo radio ignored the story all day saturday as 
did egyptian television in its evening english french and arabic 
newscasts 
us attorney david levi told a news conference in sacramento 
calif friday night that the two egyptian officers and three 
americans illegally routed sensitive military material to europe 
and the middle east without required export licenses 
one of the americans cited is an egyptianborn rocket expert who 
allegedly received 1 million from egyptian sources for his 
role a fact also omitted from egyptian press reports 
neither of the military men were arrested levi said col hussam 
yossef was in austria and col mohamed abdella mohamed was 
detained but released after claiming diplomatic immunity 
egyptian press reports did not name the men but said one worked 
in the purchasing office of the egyptian embassy in washington 
in its frontpage commentary alahram said the justice 
department announcement of charges was unclear imprecise and 
incomplete there is a serious attempt aimed at harming the 
egyptianamerican relations in the first place alahram said 
we all know that the american market is open where people buy 
and export all strategic items and other things some people may 
not think of getting prior exporting permission since the goods 
could be bought freely 
the smuggling ring was charged friday with illegal export and 
money laundering and conspiring to ship hundreds of pounds of a 
substance called carboncarbon or carbon composite to europe and 
egypt 
the special carbon material developed in the united states is 
used extensively in highspeed aircraft missiles and rockets 
because it has a low visibility level to radar and is heat 
resistant 
the carbon is on the federal restricted list and requires 
special licenses to be exported 
it is not the manner of egyptian institutions to violate the 
rules carry out espionage operations or steal secret military 
documents from the pentagon or anywhere else alahram said 
alahram denied a plane was flown to the united states to bring 
back contraband many egyptian planes arrive in the united states 
to carry military equipment that egypt gets from america the 
newspaper said 
egypt receives about 13 billion a year in military aid from 
the united states

aloha airlines was warned five months before 
the inflight breakup of one of its jets that the airline had 10 
planes with significant corrosion problems and needed a new 
maintenance program according to a published report 
the washington post reported in its sunday editions that the 
seattlebased boeing co urged aloha to replace corroded fuselage 
panels on its four most heavily flown jets including the boeing 
737 involved in the april 28 accident 
boeing also urged the airline to take the planes out of service 
in the spring for permanent repairs inspections and to complete 
all deferred maintenance the post said citing documents that it 
said are part of the government investigation into the incident in 
which a section of the planes roof ripped off during flight 
in a nov 13 letter boeing advised the airline aloha has a 
highfrequency flight schedule and operates in a highly corrosive 
environment these factors certainly contribute to the corrosion 
and fatigue damage observed on the two airplanes surveyed 
this as well as the practice of repainting the airplane before 
and during inspections deferring repairs andor making temporary 
instead of terminating permanent repairs contributes to our 
mutual concerns wrote boeing 
the manufacturer also urged aloha to develop a new maintenance 
program that would assure thorough and frequent inspections as well 
as preventive maintenance on alohas aging planes the post said 
the recommendations were made after a team of boeing engineers 
visited aloha last fall to collect data for its aging fleet 
research program the newspaper said quoting from a 150page 
document 
the document consists of boeings november maintenance 
evaluation and dozens of recommendations as well as listings of 
the highlights of september october and january inspections of 
three older aloha jets the report also includes material 
describing boeings findings in the aging fleet survey program 
aloha president maurice myers said of the documents by their 
very nature these documents would be expected to be critical and 
to recommend changes 
he told the newspaper that boeings engineers had overlooked 
many aspects of alohas operations which led them to draw 
erroneous conclusions 
the document has become part of the national transportation 
safety boards investigation of the accident the agencys hearing 
into the cause of the accident will focus not only on alohas 
maintenance program but also on boeings responsibility 
boeing did not share the information with the government until 
after the accident even though the federal aviation administration 
had asked to be apprised of progress on the research at aloha said 
the post 
according to the boeing report the newspaper said seven of 
alohas 10 jets were more than 15 years old and three of alohas 
jets had flown beyond the 75000 flights originally envisioned as 
the lifespan of the 737

soviet soldiers returning from afghanistan are 
forced to wait days and pay black market prices to get home as the 
summer vacation rush pushes the countrys transport system to its 
limits it was reported friday 
two reporters of the official news agency tass recounted trips 
around railway stations in moscow and airports in different regions 
where afghan veterans were standing in long lines to get home 
one group waited three days at a moscow station trying to get to 
simferopol the main town in the crimea one of the soviet unions 
prime vacation regions tass said

capital of tashkent where many soldiers land on their way home 
from afghanistan were asking for the equivalent of 170 or 
demanding foreign currency coupons to sell airplane tickets to 
moscow 
some veterans then have to wait in the capital penniless 
leaving only once they are sent money from home tass said 
a soldier identified only as sergei pavlov told the reporters he 
was lucky enough to have a commander who made return reservations 
in advance for his unit but he complained bitterly about a 
threehour wait in 113degree heat at the tashkent airport to clear 
customs 
ill admit we expected some other kind of welcome pavlov 
was quoted as saying 
the tass report quoted a senior defense ministry official as 
saying the situation had improved in recent days the official said 
the army was doing everything it could to clear the backlog at 
railway stations and airports

leave and conscripts finishing their twoyear compulsory military 
service the official was quoted as saying 
domestic flights on the staterun soviet airline aeroflot are 
almost always sold out even in winter in summer trains to the 
south where many of the countrys 284 million people take vacation

british dutch and belgian ships will form a joint 
minesweeping task force to keep the persian gulf clear for merchant 
vessels the british government announced friday 
the flotilla is the first joint european task force in the 
region since the iraniraq war began in september 1980 it will not 
increase the number of mine sweepers the three nations already have 
in the gulf 
ian stewart armed forces minister of state notified parliament 
in a written message friday that five minesweepers already in the 
gulf three british one dutch one belgian will begin joint 
operations july 1 
their movements will be controlled by a separate british vessel 
under command of a royal navy officer a ministry of defense 
spokesman said the commander will be assisted by a belgian or 
dutch staff officer 
the arrangements for cooperation between the royal navy and 
other western navies in the gulf remain unchanged stewart said 
naval units from the united states soviet union france and 
italy also patrol the region offering protection to their own flag 
merchant vessels the united states recently broadened its role to 
allow its warships to intervene in attacks on neutral shipping 
iran attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for iraqi raids on 
its own shipping lanes the iranians have also been accused of 
sowing mines 
the western navies have coordinated their efforts in recent 
years to keep the strategic waterway open but have retained 
separate commands 
last month stewart said soviet proposals to form a single 
unsponsored task force in the gulf would be very difficult to 
put together in practical terms 
the british dutch and belgian governments have been engaged in 
discussions for some time about bringing their minesweepers 
under joint control the ministry of defense spokesman said 
speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with british practice 
the planned withdrawal of a belgian command vessel from the area 
july 1 strengthened the case for full cooperation the 
spokesman said 
the new task force will patrol the area north of bahrain the 
spokesman said under the protection of a destroyer and two 
frigates from the royal navys armilla patrol 
the operation is codenamed calendar after the successful

jonas savimbi the usbacked leader of a 
guerrilla war against angolas cubansupported government on 
friday defended taking help from south africa 
when you are fighting for your country you must get help from 
even the devil himself said savimbi head of the national union 
for the total independence of angola also known as unita 
savimbi spoke here before a group of anticommunist cuban exiles 
as peace talks continued to end the 13year civil war 
democratic presidential contender michael dukakis and american 
black leaders have denounced savimbi for taking arms from south 
africa but he says he is misunderstood 
i condemn apartheid but i support freedom savimbi told a 
news conference im not here to discuss the policies of south 
africa which i condemn im fighting for freedom and you must do 
it any way you can 
savimbi said the current buildup of 57000 cuban troops in 
angola clouds the peace talks that began this week in cairo egypt 
the third round of discussions in two months 
the united states which also helps arm the angolan guerrillas 
is mediating between south africa and a joint angolancuban 
delegation to resolve the war and end south african rule over 
neighboring namibia 
angolas marxist government is demanding an end to south african 
military aid to the unita rebels while south africa is is 
demanding that cuba withdraw its troops from angola as a 
precondition for namibias independence

increasing tremendously

three peace groups planned an 
allnight prayer vigil as about 250 roman catholic bishops gathered 
friday for a national conference to consider aids womens issues 
and the morality of nuclear war 
on saturday the bishops are to debate and vote on a report about 
the morality of us nuclear policy 
pax christi of minnesota benedictines for peace from st joseph 
and collegeville and franciscans for peace of little falls planned 
the vigil to coincide with discussions on the morality of us 
nuclear policy 
the report on nuclear policy is the result of two years of work 
by a bishops committee commissioned as a followup to their 1983 
peace pastoral 
the committee is recommending that its conditional 
acceptance of nuclear deterrence be retained according to a 
preconference news release 
the bishops received a letter friday from gen james abrahamson 
director of the strategic defense initiative organization who 
wrote of his fears that some of conferences recommendations might 
be based on inaccurate information 
specifically i wish to challenge some of the arguments which 
attempt to substantiate the final recommendations which if 
left unchallenged will certainly perpetuate the cloud of 
misunderstanding that surrounds sdi and its promise of a moral 
deterrence to nuclear war he said 
the session at st johns university in southcentral minnesota 
is the fourth meeting in six years of the national conference of 
catholic bishops 
about 280 of the bishops also discussed friday the first draft 
of a pastoral letter on the concerns of women in church and society 
it is one thing to read a report on the reactions of women to 
the first draft of this pastoral the most rev joseph imesch 
told the conference it is quite another thing to hear women 
voice their concerns personally 
the mere fact that men were writing a pastoral letter about 
women caused considerable skepticism for a number of people said 
imesch bishop of the joliet ill diocese we dared not presume 
what women thought or felt 
the 100page document is the result of three years work by a 
committee of six bishops and seven women the committee met with 25 
national catholic womens oganizations and heard from 75000 women 
who participated in forums in 100 dioceses and at 60 colleges and 
45 military bases across the country 
the document also explores catholic tradition and proposes ways 
of addressing the concerns within the framework of the teachings of 
the church 
a majority of women love the church the report said many are 
comfortable with their treatment in the church but many others 
want more participation some saw their exclusion from the 
priesthood as unjust 
the document doesnt address the issue of the ordination of 
women to the priestood but it calls for a study of allowing women 
to become deacons 
the majority praised the churchs stance on abortion but many 
questioned its teaching on contraception 
the document which calls sexism a sin also insists that men 
take their responsibility in the areas of sexuality procreation 
and parenthood seriously 
after hearing the concerns of other bishops imesch said the 
document might need a major revision but he still hoped the bishops 
could act upon it as scheduled for their november 1989 meeting

after viewing the drought as a reason to shun 
stocks some strategists see it as a chance to buy into companies 
that could profit by selling products ranging from hybrid seeds to 
welldrilling rigs 
food processors fertilizer makers seed distributors farm 
equipment manufacturers and irrigation companies are getting 
increased scrutiny as possible investment opportunities because of 
the drought which has withered much of this years crops and sent 
corn wheat and soybean prices soaring 
the thinking is that farmers will have to invest heavily for the 
1989 harvest and that food companies will enjoy better profits from 
higher prices 
for example pioneer hibred international one of the largest 
hybrid seedcorn producers has attracted some attention as a 
possible beneficiary partly because of its advanced research into 
droughtresistant strains 
these people have been through this before and are 
exceedingly familiar with drought conditions said laurence c 
day a stock strategist at the clayton mo office of the 
investment firm newhard cook amp co they are by far the superior 
company in this business 
freighthauling companies especially railroads and truckers 
also appear wellpositioned to exploit the barge backups on the 
mississippi river which have drastically reduced the amount of 
grain shipped to food processors 
certainly the transportation aspect of the agriculture market 
is going to be a winner here because most farmers are going to be 
very quick to get their product to market said jack barbanel a 
futures expert at gruntal amp co in new york if somebody has a 
better system for transporting grains its certainly a moneymaking 
situation 
a projected shortage of soybeans also has some wall street 
analysts puzzling out the profitable opportunities soybeans are 
getting heavy attention because they are used in a wide range of 
products unrelated to food from unleaded gasoline to cosmetics 
a few strategists are even recommending poultry companies their 
argument goes like this cattle farmers will be forced to slaughter 
their herds this year because they cant afford to feed them this 
will create a shortterm beef and pork glut but by next year acute 
shortages are certain with meat prices soaring then more 
consumers may switch to cheaper chicken 
others are focusing on large fastfood chains that will likely 
benefit from higher food prices mcdonalds for example has been 
touted by some brokers recently because it is expected to get 
increased royalties linked to higher sales revenue from its 
franchised restaurants 
wall street initially seized on the drought as a sell signal 
because it implies sharply higher inflation which theoretically 
raises pressure on the federal reserve to hike interest rates and 
thus erodes the comparative value of stocks 
but as other evidence has emerged that inflation remains tame 
the drought theme has been transformed into an obscure form of good 
news in the stock market some investment strategists see it as the 
vehicle for companies to lock in greater profit margins by raising 
prices now 
in classic supplydemand fashion commodity prices could fall 
next year said john bierbusse an analyst who follows cereal 
companies for the investment firm of ag edwards amp sons in st 
louis mo but you and i both know that cereal prices dont go 
down 
others however havent flocked to the drought theme they say 
the drought could hurt food companies especially those lacking 
longterm commitments to buy grain at predrought prices they also 
say the disaster could ruin fragile rural economies and will 
clearly spill into other areas 
theres going to be some impact said william tiritilli 
vice president and director of research at rodman amp renshaw inc in 
chicago retailers and banks could get hurt a farmer who doesnt 
have crops cant pay loans back 
whatever the ultimate outcome of the drought on wall streets 
collective thinking some believe it will be shortlived soon to 
be displaced by another significant economic event 
the attention span on wall street is about 30 minutes said 
robert sobel a market historian and author if it rains 
tomorrow theyll forget about it completely

child labor widespread in old china is on the 
rise again and is worrying communist authorities 
the official media report the problem is most severe in the 
countryside where the governments new economic reforms encourage 
private farming and small rural factories young children mostly 
girls often are taken out of school to work on farms or factories 
to add to family incomes 
another reason cited is a lack of funds for rural education 
when they took over china in 1949 the communists sought to 
eliminate child labor and raise literacy rates 
they claim to have lowered illiteracy rates from 80 percent when 
they took over to 20 percent now 
the seriousness with which child labor now is viewed is 
indicated in a series of recent articles in the official press 
the weekly liaowang outlook for example recently published a 
pictorial essay featuring a 12yearold girl from the countryside 
chen zhangrong who dropped out of school to work 12 hours a day in 
a privately run paperdye factory 
she was shown in photographs carrying a bucket of what was 
described as noxious smelly dye on her first day of work 
liaowang and other chinese reports have expressed alarm at the 
trend 
an increasing number of children from rural china are missing 
out on the opportunity to go to school and the situation is 
getting worse the official newspaper china daily said 
chinese laws state that children under 16 should not work at 
all a 1986 law calls for nine years of education but the 
government acknowledges this wont be possible until the year 2000 
because of a lack of facilities 
ironically the education laws are being ignored in part because 
of chinas muchpraised economic reforms 
the development of the commodity economy has left a deep mark 
on the hearts of children liaowang said it is a popular 
slogan in coastal areas that primary school pupils make big money 
while college students make little money 
a state statistical bureau survey recently found that only 71 
percent of schoolage children were attending classes in southern 
chinas guangdong province the nations most advanced in adapting 
a marketbased economy 
the peoples daily which is the communist party newspaper 
reported the inland province of hubei had 15 million dropouts last 
year the province had about 9 million primary and middle school 
students in 1985 
the state education commission says 96 percent of chinese 
children complete the six grades of primary school but only about 
twothirds go on to threeyear junior middle school which is 
theoretically compulsory 
a heavy proportion of the dropouts are girls who traditionally 
have received little education in rural china and are now in demand 
to work in the thousands of small textile and light industry plants 
springing up in the countryside 
the official guangming daily blaming wrong parental 
attitudes for the dropout problem said an investigation of four 
construction teams in jiangxi province southern china found that 
nearly a quarter of the workers were children 
in hebei province to the north it added a third of the 
peddlers in one village market were junior middle school dropouts 
my mother told me to quit one 12yearold candy seller was 
quoted as saying it quoted the mother as saying she thought school 
fees were a waste of money since the boy had little chance of 
getting a higher education 
china has only about 2 million university students compared to 
180 million primary and middle school students out of a population 
of 1 billion 
although china spends a respectable 3 percent of gross national 
product on education 20 percent of that goes to higher education 
primary schools particularly in rural areas face financial 
problems that have discouraged school attendance 
one report from coastal fujian province said 148 rural schools 
in one region had been closed and 2800 pupils had no place to go 
to school because so many teachers among the lowestpaid workers 
in china had resigned to take other jobs 
the fujian daily quoted chen quanbao as saying he quit his 
teaching job which paid 335 yuan 9 a month to make as much in 
three days selling tea leaves as he did in a semester of teaching 
although schooling is supposed to be free financially strapped 
schools have slapped on various maintenance fees some poor 
families say these have forced them to withdraw their children

the stifling heat baking much of america 
threatens more than crops weather experts warn heat kills people 
too 
the 1980 heat wave claimed the lives of an estimated 1265 
americans according to an analysis prepared for the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administrationmany of the victims were 
elderly and poor living in homes or apartments that lacked air 
conditioning 
hot weather places greater stress on the heart and blood 
vessels warns the department of health and human services thus 
when temperatures rise so do the number of heart attacks and 
strokes 
and high humidity just makes it worse by interfering with the 
bodys ability to cool itself 
the human body is cooled by evaporation of sweat and by 
circulating blood closer to the skin to allow the heat to dissipate 
the problem is that when the air temperature gets close to the 
bodys 986 degree fahrenheit normal heat doesnt dissipate 
outward as readily 
sweating does nothing to cool the body unless the moisture is 
removed by evaporation into the air and humid air isnt as willing 
to accept that liquid as is dry air 
as the body tries to cope with increasing heat it begins pumping 
a torrent of blood through the dilated circulatory system while 
the sweat glands pour out liquid including dissolved chemicals 
that the body may need 
what follows can be a heatrelated illness when the body can no 
longer shed enough heat to keep its temperature near normal levels 
or when it can not cope with loss of liquid and chemicals these 
illnesses include heat cramps heat exhaustion and heatstroke 
heat cramps are painful spasms often occurring in the muscles 
of the legs and abdomen noaa experts in weather and health 
recommend firm pressure on the cramping muscle followed by gentle 
massage give the victim water to drink 
heat exhaustion they point out is more serious symptoms 
include heavy sweating weakness cold pale clammy skin the 
victim may faint or vomit 
treatment includes getting the victim out of the sun to a place 
where they can lie down and loosen their clothing get them to a 
fan or air conditioned area if possible and apply cool wet 
cloths give water to drink if vomiting continues seek medical 
attention 
the most dangerous condition is heat stroke also known as 
sunstroke in this case the body temperature can rise to dangerous 
levels skin is hot and dry pulse rapid and the victim may become 
unconscious 
heat stroke is a severe emergency summon medical assistance or 
get the victim to a hospital noaa warns delay can be fatal 
while waiting for help get the victim to a cooler environment 
use fans or air conditioner and cool sponging but do not give 
fluids the agency says 
here is a list of summertime suggestions from noaa aimed at 
preventing heatrelated illnesses 
slow down strenuous activities should be reduced eliminated 
or rescheduled to the coolest time of the day 
dress for summer lightweight lightcolored clothing reflects 
heat and sunlight and helps maintain normal body temperature 
eat less foods like proteins increase metabolic heat 
production and also induce more water loss 
drink plenty of water your body needs water to keep cool so 
drink plenty of fluids even if you dont feel thirsty but avoid or 
reduce use of alcoholic beverages persons with fluid restrictions 
or with epilepsy heart kidney or liver disease should consult 
their doctor 
do not take salt tablets unless directed by a physician 
do not get too much sun sunburn reduces the skins efficiency 
at cooling the body 
spend time in air conditioned places if you cannot afford home 
air conditioning spend some time in another air conditioned 
environment such as a shopping center or other commercial building

computer companies face an awful dilemma each 
time they introduce a new product to bore the audience with bits 
and bytes or gag it with glitz 
this past week just when cool and dry seemed to be the trend a 
pair of multimilliondollar events showed that computer companies 
still love show biz 
on monday compaq computer corp unveiled two personal computers 
by filling a new york stage with electronic music and athletic 
ballet dancers in shiny multicolored body suits 
a day later international business machines corp announced new 
midsized computers with an academy awardsstyle show beamed by 
satellite to 100000 people across the united states the biggest 
such broadcast ever by a private company 
larry ford an ibm executive gamely followed a script that had 
him receiving a lollipop a loan approval and a toy soldiers hat 
from actors portraying grateful ibm customers 
at first it seems incongruous for computer makers the vanguard 
of the rational age of high technology to be falling back on 
pyrotechnics and emotional appeals 
but then again people are people and no one gets a big charge 
out of hearing someone in a suit drone on about 48bit 
addressability or 82385 cache memory controllers 
we punctuate the straight business message with a little 
glitter like the machines rising out of the floor to make it a 
little more warm and a little less formal said bert reisman 
ibms assistant group executive for the marketing and services 
group 
glitter is second nature to compaq which in 1985 hired the 
pointer sisters to dance on a huge model of its portable 286 
singing im so excited 
still the houstonbased computer maker wants to be taken 
seriously 
its not just that were interested in throwing a party 
said james darezzo compaqs vice president for corporate 
marketing the bottom line is youre trying to capture mind 
space of the press the analyst community and most of all your 
authorized dealers 
yes but how much glitter is too much glitter 
weve got eventinflation i think complained esther dyson 
editor and publisher of release 10 newsletter and a veteran of 
uncounted product introductions 
i really hate the ones where they give you 10 minutes of rock 
music in the dark she said my basic feeling is if i want to 
see dancing ill buy a ticket and go with a date 
ibm with more than 50 billion in annual revenue must be doing 
something right but some people who attend its shows say they have 
gone from dull to slightly embarrassing 
bill machrone editorinchief and publisher of pc magazine 
cringes in memory of an event last year at which ibm executives 
fumbled through a supposedly impromptu and humorous interchange 
with jamie farr and bill christopher the former mash 
characters 
its painful to watch but ibm i think they think theyre 
really rocking and rolling when they do this machrone said 
people are afraid to tell them otherwise 
thats a slightly harsh assessment said nora f gildea 
director of marketing for ideassociates inc of billerica mass a 
company that does business with ibm 
it was ok everybody sort of laughed wryly in our group 
youre talking about seasoned customers whove been to a lot of 
these things 
commodore international ltd introduced its amiga three years 
ago by having andy warhol take a digitized image of blondies 
deborah harry and use the computer to paint her picture live on 
stage at new yorks lincoln center 
compaq once made its chief executive rod canion appear from 
nowhere on stage in a blaze of light it was especially 
entertaining because canion is the ultimate straight man 
i think he sleeps in his suit and tie so that was a magical 
moment ms dyson said 
apple computer inc has gotten quiet after a run of 
announcements that included lowering its apple iigs from the 
ceiling into a blaze of lasers and dry ice 
once apple revved up a sales or dealer meeting with a version of 
ghostbusters featuring dancers in radiation suits macintoshes 
strapped to their backs singing blue busters 
apple spokeswoman marlene williamson said apple has been 
concentrating lately on networking and communications products that 
arent suited to media blitzes she vows apple will be back with a 
splash when the time is right

the dollars stunning rise this past week may 
have provided the psychological lift that some traders say the 
stock market needed to restart its widely touted summer rally but 
others arent so sure 
it was on wednesday the first full day of summer that the 
dollar leaped in value against key foreign currencies inciting a 
strong rise in stock prices and propelling the dow jones industrial 
average to the highest point since the october crash 
its taking down some of the psychological and fiscal 
barricades eugene peroni a technical strategist for the 
philadelphia investment firm janney montgomery scott inc said of 
the dollars surge i think the market is better poised now to 
respond to good news and glad tidings 
asked if the markets behavior wednesday may have marked a 
turning point peroni said i think it could very well play that 
way yes 
two weeks ago many wall street brokers were talking about a 
preseason summer rally that they say began at the end of may many 
predicted a further revival of enthusiasm for stocks despite any 
big change in the economic news 
the following week the dow industrials hit two postcrash highs 
but tumbled on fear of rising interest rates the summerrally 
promoters said maybe the season hadnt begun after all 
but this past week the rising dollar restored market confidence 
by doing two good things optimists argue first it eased fears of 
rapidly rising inflation caused by a cheap currency which makes 
imports more expensive secondly it encouraged a return to the 
stock market by foreigners whose postcrash absence had been 
sorely missed by wall street 
foreign buying was widely evident wednesday the most obvious 
sign was a surge in stocks such as ibm du pont westinghouse and 
boeing which historically attract overseas interest because 
theyre so wellknown 
skeptics argue the dollars surge wasnt a longterm trend and 
should not be the sole basis for buying stocks many attribute the 
markets rise to other transient causes such as the endofquarter 
window dressing period when money managers buy stocks to make 
their client portfolios look better 
as evidence for their argument they say a fundamental market 
rally lasts for several days and is marked by heavy trading volume 
it hasnt happened stock prices weakened thursday and friday and 
the volume was moderate 
i think its a bear market this is what happens in bear 
markets said paul campbell a technical strategist and vice 
president at nikko securities co international i dont think 
this thing is the beginning of something long and sustainable 
for the week the dow industrials finished at 214296 a gain 
of 3894 points or 19 percent volume on the floor of the new york 
stock exchange averaged 17099 million shares a day compared with 
20164 million a day the previous week 
among the broader market barometers the nyse composite index 
ended the week 172 points higher at 15456 the nasdaq composite 
index for the overthecounter market rose 470 points to 39162 
and the american stock exchange market value index rose 279 to 
30849 
by the end of the week summerrally skeptics offered another 
argument against putting too much faith in the power of the 
dollars advance they said talk had resurfaced that the dollar 
might get too expensive and hurt the nations gradually narrowing 
trade deficit 
the psychology in this market is crazy said philip c 
puccio senior vice president and manager of institutional trading 
at dillon read amp co in new york before they liked the dollar 
where it was now the dollar is going up so theyre starting to get 
worried people are getting so analytical theyre losing sight of 
the longterm its really putting the skids on this market

bond prices danced to the dollars tune this

what is going to happen when the upbeat music ends 
the dollar is on a temporary run and if you want to join the 
party you had better belly up to the bar quickly before they quit 
serving free drinks said robert brusca economist for nikko 
securities international in new york 
when the dollar stops rising brusca said chances increase that 
bond prices are going to slip and interest rates will edge higher 
the dollar climbed sharply this week after the major industrial 
nations meeting in toronto reaffirmed their support for stability 
of the dollar in foreignexchange markets 
as the dollar rose foreign investors decided dollardenominated 
securities looked even more attractive and their buying ignited a 
powerful rally in treasury notes and bonds 
on wednesday prices of the bellwether 30year treasury issue 
climbed 18 for every 1000 in face value while its yield skidded 
to 891 percent from 908 percent the previous evening 
by midday friday prices were up another 5 for every 1000 in 
face value for the week and yields fell to 886 percent compared 
with 909 percent at the end of the previous week 
but one question facing bond investors at the end of the week 
was what will happen if the dollars climb runs out of steam the 
analysts say it may force the market to focus again on economic 
fundamentals and there is wide disagreement on what the 
fundamentals show 
harold nathan chief economist for wells fargo amp co in san 
francisco said he finds evidence of solid growth in the united 
states and abroad that will generate gains in inflation to the 
detriment of bond prices 
its my belief that this rally is going to be shortlived and 
its not a trend he said rates will head generally higher 
with sporadic rallies like this last one creating volatility along 
the line 
by the end of the year nathan expects the 30year treasury will 
yield about 99 percent or a full percentage point higher than its 
current level 
nikkos brusca said he sees some negative signs for the bond 
market industrial production remains strong factories are 
operating near full capacity and industrial commodity prices such 
as aluminum zinc and nickel are rising that could push inflation 
higher possibly prompting the federal reserve to encourage higher 
interest rates 
he expects the long treasurys yield will rise to 975 percent 
before settling down to about 95 percent at the end of the year 
but mickey levy chief economist for first fidelity 
bancorporation in philadelphia said he finds mixed evidence on the 
strength of the economy in the latest economic reports and expects 
a slowdown is imminent 
this past week for instance the government reported a 22 
percent decline in durable goods orders for may and said the 
economy grew at a 36 percent rate in the first quarter after 
adjustment for inflation down from its 39 percent growth estimate 
a month earlier 
levy said he expects longterm rates to fall to 875 percent by 
the end of the year and 8 percent by the middle of 1989 as a 
reduction in capital spending leads to a broader economic slowdown 
elliott platt research director for the investment firm 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp is even more 
optimistic about chances for lower rates 
he said he thinks a moderation in economic growth over the next 
few months will send longterm rates to the 8 percent to 825 
percent range by fall 
platt worries about the impact that the drought may have on the 
economy but it isnt the concern you might expect while he 
expects the drought to push food prices higher he doesnt think 
the increase will add much to overall inflation 
platt is more concerned about the psychological damage that 
higher food prices may have on consumers willingness to spend a 
key factor in keeping the economy growing once they see food 
prices increase we may have a break in consumer confidence he 
said

personal spending and personal income for the month of may

stocks slipped most grain prices retreated in response to 
scattered showers while energy futures prices dropped

john hagens an economist with the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa consulting firm said i think basically our biggest concern 
is how weak consumer spending is the income growth is simply 
not there to support much growth particularly given higher food 
prices expected because of the drought he said 
through the first five years of the sixyear economic expansion 
consumer buying has fueled the growth now analysts are looking 
for exports and sale of equipment to businesses to drive the 
economy

taxes shot up 15 percent in may after a 10 percent drop in
